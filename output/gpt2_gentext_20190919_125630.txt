Learn more about the new loot in the following sections.

Dungeon Finder

The Dungeon Finder supports Dungeon groups of up to 5 players.
The Dungeon Group includes all the item levels of common items, as well as
as item level of rare items.

In addition to the Dungeon Group, the Dungeon Group allows you to search for quests through the Dungeon Finder.

Raid Finder

The Raid Finder allows you to search for raid bosses, dungeons, and raids in

level.

The Raid Finder also supports searching for specific dungeons, rather than just the

have completed all the required quests, so it's best to experiment!

Honorable mentions
I know this is going to be a long post, and that it may take some time for everyone to fully absorb all of the above, especially since we're still a very young team, and not many of you have actually seen the game or really been in touch with the people behind the concept. So, here it is, and for those of you who are fortunate enough to be able to take the time to read through the full post, please bear with us: the Tides of Vengeance is a very small but growing team, and will be further expanded upon in future patches.
We'll continue to add to the depth of this out-of-the-box mechanic through the use of the new "Honorable Kills" feature, which gives players the opportunity to earn additional Honor upon earning a certain number of "Honorable Kills" from a given raid or dungeon boss.
Along the way, players will unlock new zones and dungeons, and will gain new titles, titles, and titles. To begin, we want to make it clear that this is not an official launch of Tides of Vengeance, and that there will be no additional changes for those new to the game who try to enter these new zones or dungeons.

Tooth and Claw
Borrowed Time
Lesson 1
Avoidance is a major focus of the Lesson 1.0, and Lesson 1.1 is the foundation of the Lesson Mastery system.
Avoidance is a passive ability gained by Discipline and Holy priests at level 30.
The distinction is important. In addition to increasing critical strike chance,
Avoidance also provides a steady flow of bonus damage to healing spells. Most
instances of Avoidance being used will result in increased healing from the
most powerful spells, spells with a small chance of causing a significant healing error.
This healing error will trigger a large healing increase from the most powerful
spell, such as [Spirit Shell].
This healing increase will then be spread evenly to the remainder of the healing
effects. In addition, spells with a small chance of causing a healing error will
have a small healing error chance with this ability.
This healing increase will then occur automatically over time, as the maximum
ever increase will provide with periodic effects.
In addition, while periodic healing effects may have a small healing
error chance with this ability, the actual healing increase will be spread evenly
over the duration of the effect.
Lesson 2 teaches the exact same healing increase with no additional changes for
your character's total stats.

Lesson 3: All healing spells which critically strike the player's
enemy's target will also critically strike the player's internal organs.

The spells and abilities which critically strike the player's target will also critically strike
the player's internal organs.
