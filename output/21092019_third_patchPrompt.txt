World of Warcraft: Patch 8.2.5a
              
            
         
        
        
     
     
     We now have the time to address some issues that cropped up during the
      pre-Mists of Pandaria transition. In Patch 8.2.5a, we had the
      opportunity to add some additional Azerite power to the game, and
       in doing so, inadvertently added some additional complexity to the
       game. The intent with this change was to add additional layers of
       defense against potential Blizzard DDoS attacks. Unfortunately, the
       result was undesirable. We chose to add these powers in a way that
       mitigates the complexity by providing a more intuitive, but also
       secure, way to do battle.
      
      
      In order to achieve this, we decided to remove the ability for
       raid bosses to benefit from Azerite powers. This left us with the
       option to add another layer of defense against Blizzard
       DDoS attacks.
      
      
       * Additional layers of defense can be easily obtained by mixing and
          matching raid items with each other. However, it is
          extremely difficult to do so, and we don't think it's a fun
          business.
        * We decided to combine the two existing layers of defense
          by adding a new class of Raid Items that is available at
          the start of each season. Players can earn the [Battle for
          Pandaria] title by defeating random pre-Mists of Pandaria
          raid bosses that are available from the start of Season 2.
       
      
      
       * Additional Raid Items that can be earned from Mists of Pandaria
          bosses that are available from the start of Season 2 are
          constantly being rolled out over the course of the season.
          These items are awarded from a random pre-Mists of Pandaria boss
          that are available from the start of the preseason.
        
       
      
      
      We also made a few adjustments to how Raid Finder
       difficulty is now set. The first is to adjust the difficulty of
       Raid Finder so that it does a better job of balancing the number of
       possible wins. This should provide a smoother and more
       balanced experience for both casual and hardcore players.
       
      
       * Season 1 Raid Finder difficulties can be obtained by
          joining the instance halfway through the game, completing the
          instance quests, and then
          choosing to redeem the Raid Finder version for a chance at
          obtaining the item that would've gone to the previous
           Mists of Pandaria raid boss.
        
        
      
      
       * Season 2 Raid Finder difficulties can be obtained by
          joining the instance halfway through the game,
          completing the instance quests, and then
          choosing to redeem the Raid Finder version for a chance at
