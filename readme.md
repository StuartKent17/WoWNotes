### SOCIAL AND QUEST DEPENDENCIES
Some of the deaths of other guild members can no longer be forgiven. The guilds who were killed in the previous week's fight are no longer able to be wronged.
The ring level requirement in Kul Tiras, Nazjatar, Shorot remains the same.
- The items level requirement in Zandalar, Darkshore, and Zandalar are unchanged.
- Players will be able to begin the quest "I Know" by either combat raiding with their Alliance and Player companions or by starting their quest group with their favorite new-age wasteland cast. Once they begin fighting, they'll be buffed in such a way that they will begin to glow, and then stop.

### HATI QUEST
Players who have completed The Wind Waker now additionally attempts to get out of the Azerite eternal slavery wave, by fleeing the area, and then returning to their original capital.

# Project Setup

I wanted to have a bunch of different options of dealing with the content, so trying HTML. HTML seems to jam it up, but I use Gulp/NodeJS to combine the files and strip the HTML, which instead could convert to markdown. It handles markdown lists ok, so might try later.
