Holy

* Blessing of Sacrifice is no longer consumed by Holy Priests.

* Blessing of Sacrifice damage increased by 400%.

Kaldorei

* Koran Orb now requires the Blessing of Sacrifice to be active.

* Blessing of Sacrifice has been redesigned. The ability forms an Orb of Fasting around a Binder's shoulder, increasing the duration of Blessing ofasting by 0.5 second.

* Glyph of Fasting now heals up to four friendly targets with your Atonement active (was all nearby friendly targets).


# Project Setup

The idea is to create a bunch of different ways of dealing with the content, so trying HTML, only the notes, a mix of headings and notes. This will be achieved with NodeJS and Gulp just because of the variety of HTML processing tools available.
