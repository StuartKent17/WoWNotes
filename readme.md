### SOCIAL AND QUEST DEPENDENCIES
Some of the deaths of other guild members can no longer be forgiven. The guilds who were killed in the previous week's fight are no longer able to be wronged.
The ring level requirement in Kul Tiras, Nazjatar, Shorot remains the same.
- The items level requirement in Zandalar, Darkshore, and Zandalar are unchanged.
- Players will be able to begin the quest "I Know" by either combat raiding with their Alliance and Player companions or by starting their quest group with their favorite new-age wasteland cast. Once they begin fighting, they'll be buffed in such a way that they will begin to glow, and then stop.

### HATI QUEST
Players who have completed The Wind Waker now additionally attempts to get out of the Azerite eternal slavery wave, by fleeing the area, and then returning to their original capital.

This was a model trained off three pages of unformatted text. 

**Paladin**


Holy

* Blessing of Sacrifice is no longer consumed by Holy Priests.

* Blessing of Sacrifice damage increased by 400%.

Kaldorei

* Koran Orb now requires the Blessing of Sacrifice to be active.

* Blessing of Sacrifice has been redesigned. The ability forms an Orb of Fasting around a Binder's shoulder, increasing the duration of Blessing ofasting by 0.5 second.

* Glyph of Fasting now heals up to four friendly targets with your Atonement active (was all nearby friendly targets).


# Project Setup

The idea is to create a bunch of different ways of dealing with the content, so trying HTML, only the notes, a mix of headings and notes. This will be achieved with NodeJS and Gulp just because of the variety of HTML processing tools available.
