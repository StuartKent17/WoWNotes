<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">-&nbsp;<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Level squish to 50</strong>,&nbsp;<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">new level cap 60</strong>&nbsp;(Vanilla 1-20, TBC / WotLK / Cataclysm 20-30, MoP / WoD 30-40, Legion / BfA 40-50, AoD 50-60)</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">-&nbsp;<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">New class Tinker</strong>, two specializations &ldquo;Explosives&rdquo; (ranged dd) + &ldquo;Combat Medic&rdquo; (healing), exclusive to Gnomes / Mechagnomes / Draenei / Goblins / Gilgoblins / Forsaken (pre-purchasable with Mechagnomes &amp; Gilgoblins in 8.3 or 8.3.5)</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">-&nbsp;<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Story:</strong>&nbsp;N&rsquo;zoth unleashes darkness over Azeroth as foreshadowed in the Nighthold raid encounter with Star Augur Etraeus. Starting point is the attack on Thunder Bluff raid where he interrupts the Horde and Alliance forces in the final battle. Kalimdor is his first goal as the strives to revive one of our oldest foes, C&rsquo;Thun in Silithus. To do this he&rsquo;s seeking to destroy the Bronze Dragonflight and turn Nozdormu into Murozond so he alters the timeline where C&rsquo;Thun doesn&rsquo;t get defeated and the battle of Ahn&rsquo;Qiraj is lost by Horde and Alliance in consequence.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">- No real dragon focus yet Bronze and Infinite dragonflight play a major role</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">- Xal&rsquo;atath will play a major role as the main antagonist of the Old Gods (some kind of evil neutral); she commands us to captivate and imprison Sylvanas instead of killing her because we need her</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">-&nbsp;<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Partial old world revamp:</strong>&nbsp;only unlocks after finishing the pre-quest for Age of Darkness; for new players it will be the same as live until they do the pre-quest at level 50</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">- Starting with Kalimdor: Un&rsquo;Goro, Feralas, Desolace + Mulgore as new high level zones, Silithus will be the endgame zone akin to Suramar (?)</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">- Eastern Kingdom will be revamped later on with something special planned for Gilneas, Tirisfal and the Plaguelands (hint towards the Old God underneath Tirisfal?)</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">-&nbsp;<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">New features:</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">-&nbsp;<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Essence system</strong>&nbsp;unlocked at level 50: every class gets several new skill and traits from 50-60, similar to the Glyph system we once had; 5 sockets, 2 for passive traits, 2 for active skills and 1 ultimate ability</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">-&nbsp;<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Reshaping of the talent system:</strong>&nbsp;offensive and defensive talents per bracket at level 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50; you can pick one offensive plus one defensive talent per bracket</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">-&nbsp;<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Conquest points</strong>&nbsp;(new max level leveling system): unlocked at level 60, account wide, different bonuses you can spend points on (more execute damage, higher run speed); once unlocked it&rsquo;s available for all characters on the account that are at least level 10</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">-&nbsp;<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Release date planned for Q4/2020</strong>&nbsp;but they want to polish this expansion so it might get delayed</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">BfA's ending:</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">-&nbsp;<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">8.2.5</strong>&nbsp;will introduce new heritage armor and new models</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">- Will deal mostly with factions and the aftermath of the events from Eternal Palace</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">-&nbsp;<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Final patch 8.3 set in Mulgore</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">- Centered around Sylvanas plan to attack Thunder Bluff</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">- Mulgore will be turned into a new max level zone similar to Mechagon with ongoing progress and weekly unlocks, culminating in the attack on Thunder Bluff raid</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">- Sylvanas is the final boss with Nathanos aiding her; Nathanos will be killed, Sylvanas will be severely wounded, captivated and imprisoned by her sisters Alleria and Vereesa</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">- Shortly before the fight is over N&rsquo;zoth&rsquo;s minions enter the battlefield and fight Sylvanas and us, everything turns dark (?)</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">- No schedule for the patches yet as everything during BfA took longer than expected; plan is for 8.3 to be released this year yet it might not happen</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">-&nbsp;<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Mechagnomes and Gilgoblins will be the last pair of allied races coming in 8.3(.5)</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">-&nbsp;<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Factions won&rsquo;t merge / get removed</strong>, there will be some kind of neutrality and inter-factional group play / communication enabled (one of the reasons given is the huge discrepancy of Alliance vs. Horde on most realms and in the raiding community)</p>
