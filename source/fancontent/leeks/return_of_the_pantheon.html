<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Patch 8.3 is the&nbsp;<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Return of the Pantheon;</strong></p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">We discover that Azeroth will only heal when the Blade of Sargeras is removed, and to do that, we need a Titan;</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">New zone: Maker's Citadel, a "spaceport" zone were the Seat of the Pantheon is docked. Remnants of the Burning Legion and other forces are invading to free/destroy Sargeras themselves. Tichondrius plays a major role as the Last Leader of the Legion.</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Two raids: Divine Battlefield and Tower of Thant</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Divine Battlefield - 10 bosses, with the ending one being a battle against the Final Avatar of Sargeras, where we assist Illidan in a final clash against the Dark Titan. Once he's defeated, the Titans will be freed, and Khaz'goroth will remove the Blade of Sargeras from Azeroth, ending the Azerite War.</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Tower of Thant - 1 boss, The Darkest Paragon, like an anti Champion of Azeroth with his own "Heart of Azeroth", which is actually an warmace similar to the Hammer of Twilight called The True Hammer. The tower itself is an dimensional elevator that ends in Ny'alotha, that Nathanos found through Xal'atath in the middle of the ocean. Nathanos was supposed to somehow recruit that thing into the Horde, to finally tip the scales of the war. We find Nathanos mid-battle with the thing, trying to subjugate it with Xal'atath.</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The expansion ends with Azerite deactivating and the Horde and Alliance ending their war. Sylvanas remains Warchief. Next one has N'Zoth as the main antagonist.</p>
