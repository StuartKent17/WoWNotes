<p>Story</p>
<p>The next expansion is going to be following Queen Azshara rising from the sea. However, contrary to popular belief, the Naga won't play a big part in the next expansion. After realizing that her trusted Naga have been failing her over and over again, Queen Azshara had started using them as canonfodder over the years while preparing her master plan. She has managed to gather a massive amount of Murlocs and started training them in Nazjatar.</p>
<p>Murlocs, being, as it turns out, Titanforged races, very quickly started adapting to using Arcane. Their minds quickly evolved, however, and they actually managed to overthrow Queen Azshara with King Mrgl-Mrgl becoming the ruler of the Empire. As it turns out, we were the ones who got fooled. King Mrgl-Mrgl was never pretending to be a Murloc, he was pretending to be a Human pretending to be a Murloc.</p>
<p>King Mrgl-Mrgl is confirmed to be the big boss of the expansion, even though N'zoth will play a major part. Blizzard said that, while they like not revealing the big expansion boss, they wanted to go back to the good ol' expansions being centered around the big bad from the beginning of the expansion formula. Back to the story, though.</p>
<p>As the story goes on, Queen Azshara is banished, but, a group of Murlocs, still loyal to her, follow her. Queen Azshara, realizing she isn't as superior as she thought, goes through a mental breakdown. However, she reaches Kul Tiras, where she is accepted by Jaina, for Jaina too had experienced such heavy loss. Players complained about Jaina's character development from the novels being nowhere to be found in the game, so Blizzard decided to make Jaina go batshit insane, talking to her cats Snuffles, Snuggles and Garrosh on a regular basis. They thought that this kind of storytelling wasn't seen in WoW yet, and they believe they can get far with it.</p>
<p>Murlocs following Queen Azshara become playable.</p>
<p>Zones</p>
<p>The expansion takes place on the well known continent Tel'Abim. As for old world zones, Blizzard decided to revamp them, but they listened to the playerbase this time. After the major backlash for sinking Thousand Needles, Blizzard decided to revert Thousand Needles to it's original state, and, to compensate, sunk every other zone in the game. This also allows Blizzard to introduce the second-in-command of King Mrgl-Mrgl, Javy Dones, who we'll learn more about as the expansion goes on.</p>
<p>Races</p>
<p>You do not have to worry. All races get their own storylines, and the expansion will be hugely focused on racial identity.</p>
<p>Trolls:</p>
<p>The Trolls have had a major lack of characters after Vol'jin's death, the only well established Troll to take the mantle being Rokhan. Rokhan, however, is not experienced in politics, which causes major drama in the Darkspear Tribe. Revantusk Tribe even attempts to sweep in and grab the position as the de-facto Horde Troll tribe while this is all going on. Many different characters are established, and, King Rastakhan even ends up playing a major part, after the Trolls help him reclaim the position of King which Zul had stole. After this, King Rastakhan steps up as the leader of the Trolls, to guide all Trolls, including the ones in the Horde. However, Rokhan, now knowing what he must do, denies Rastakhan the pleasure, puts him in his spot and assumes the position of the King of all Trolls, showing that Trolls can still be as mighty as they've once been, as well as establishing major Troll characters that, including the rest of the Troll race, all die when a wave hits their shores, to reinforce Azeroth being a realistic world.</p>
<p>Orcs:</p>
<p>The Orc storyline follows your character and Saurfang. Saurfang, old and tired, only wishes a death worthy of a legend. You follow him, trying to find a threat worthy enough to kill the old Orc. As time goes on, though, Saurfang just one shots everything thrown in his way. Which is when Saurfang tells you, his champion, that it is time for you two to fight. That -you- are, truly, the only one who can defeat Saurfang, the one who stood next to him through all of this, and the one who will assume the title of High Overlord after his death. You salute him and the battle starts. He one shots you though, before killing himself.</p>
<p>Tauren:</p>
<p>Baine has become addicted to Peacebloom. You are tasked with helping him fight the addiction. However, in a plot twist, your character gets to addicted to Peacebloom as well. For the rest of the campaign, you and Baine go on a world-wide campaign to legalize Peacebloom.</p>
<p>Forsaken:</p>
<p>Your character goes through the ritual Nathanos went through, when he managed to experience emotions again. Your character suddenly feels the need for revenge after realizing what Sylvanas had turned them into and goes on a campaign to conduct the ritual on as many people as possible, to start a rebelion against Sylvanas. The rebelion starts strong, however, as time goes on, it falls off rapidly, as the ritual stops working and people return to their mind controlled state. Sylvanas, however, in a last ditch effort, goes through the ritual herself, bamboozling the rebels and, in their confusion, they wasted their time to act, and so they too returned to their old state, defeated.</p>
<p>Blood Elves:</p>
<p>The entire campaign focuses on the Sunreavers once again establishing themselves as a major force in the Kirin Tor, as equals. As time goes on, all of the characters get their spot in the sun, going through a lot of character development. Aethas accidentally fucks everything up though and Sunreavers are exiled again. Blizzard believes that, by doing this, they would stay true to the character of Aethas.</p>
<p>Goblins:</p>
<p>During one of your experiments with explosives, you accidentally trigger a nuke which destroys everything around you, including yourself. The entire campaign is your life rushing beneath your very eyes. You have to relive those painful moments when you didn't read the quest log and killed rabbits thinking that's what you're supposed to do while it turns out you just had to pat them. It turns out that this whole experience was just a byproduct of getting high in the Pleasure Palace, though.</p>
<p>The Alliance doesn't get anything though, to combat the rumors of Alliance bias. Not to worry, though, if enough people complain, Blizzard is ready to delete the Horde racial campaigns as well.</p>
<p>Shipyards</p>
<p>Ships are finally in the game! You are able to build your own ship and send it off to different iconic zones mentioned in the Warcraft lore, and your Followers get to quest all the way through those zones!</p>
<p>PvE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>-Due to the amount of people complaining about LFR only dropping runes and gold, Blizzard has decided to delete loot from the game.</li>
<li>-Blizzard also got confused by the amount of people talking about how LFR should be removed because of Premade Groups, so they decided to remove all other difficulties instead.</li>
<li>-All mechanics are replaced with soaking.</li>
<li>-5 new raids on release, 18 dungeons.</li>
<li>-Raid 1: Told You It Was a Setback, starring Kael'thas Sunstrider.</li>
<li>-Raid 2: Onyxia's Mancave, Onyxia comes back in a one man raid.</li>
<li>-Raid 3: Archimonde's Revenge. Because of the confusion caused by the Mythic Only phase of Archimonde's fight, Blizzard decided to bring Archimonde back to finally end the speculation on if he died or not. At the end of the raid, alpha-testers say that he pulls the raid into the Twisting Nether, and that the cinematic afterwards takes place outside of the Twisting Nether, as a throwback to HFC.</li>
<li>-Raid 4: The Purge of Goldshire. Throwback to Arthas purging Stratholme, only different being that it's Anduin this time around, and everyone supports his decision to wipe out Goldshire.</li>
<li>-Raid 5: Icecrown Citadel 2.0. The adventurers suddenly have a thought that maybe Bolvar doesn't really have the best intentions so they kill him just in case. After Bolvar dies, Taranas comes back to remind us that there must always be a Lich King. However, soon after we realize that a mindless army isn't much of a problem to deal with and all of the Scourge gets dealt with faster than you can say "6.1 isn't a content patch."</li>
</ul>
<p>PvP</p>
<ul>
<li>-Players seemed to want a new battleground, so Blizzard decided to introduce 0,5 of a battleground as paid DLC. However, in these battlegrounds, you fight NPCs. Blizzard thought this was a good way to please PvPers AND PvEers.</li>
<li>-To compensate for adding a whole 0,5 of a battleground, to make sure PvPers weren't getting too spoiled, Blizzard decided to remove PvP itself.</li>
<li>Quality of life changes</li>
<li>-Doing /dab instantly locks your account and sends your private information to the FBI.</li>
<li>-Introducing forced server transfers. If enough people band together, they can pay to kick a person off a realm.</li>
<li>-As a form of psychological torture, Blizzard introduced Vanilla Servers, but, every time you enter one of these servers, you have a 1% chance of being permanently banned from entering the realm ever again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Classes</p>
<ul>
<li>-Blizzard removed "No path available" entirely, now every path is available, fuck it, if it's gonna stop the shitposts on Reddit, it's worth. Happy now, Warriors?</li>
<li>-Paladins now have 500% movement speed when in a wheelchair.</li>
<li>-Hunters can now tame their own Worgen players who play the game for them.</li>
<li>-Whenever you shadowstep behind someone as a Rogue, a "Nothin personnel, kid&nbsp;<img title="Cool" src="https://www.mmo-champion.com/images/smilies/cool.png" alt="" border="0" />" voiceline plays.</li>
<li>-We told you jackasses we didn't want you to play Demonology but noooo. Well, here you go, now Warlocks are removed. Happy?</li>
<li>-Priests no longer pray to the Light, nor Shadow, but RNG Gods. Every picture of Chris Metzen sitting next to your monitor increases your chance of getting a legendary by %1.</li>
<li>-Now, like in the lore, Shamans have to ask the Elements to aid you, meaning that your spells are completely RNG based. Elements will only help you depending on your luck. (Note: They will completely refuse to answer if you dip muffins into tea.)</li>
<li>-Mages can now no longer affect people who do not believe in magic.</li>
<li>-Monks all have a chance of dying from alcohol poisoning.</li>
<li>-Since the playerbase has been complaining about how Fel Rush is inconsistent and it sometimes crashes the game, to make it more consistent, every time someone uses a Fel Rush, Silvermoon-EU goes down.</li>
<li>-Druids are now hired in zoos to pretend to be specific extinct animals to give the illusion that those animals are still out there.</li>
<li>-Death Knights, seeing as they have no souls, are now ginger by default.</li>
<li></li>
