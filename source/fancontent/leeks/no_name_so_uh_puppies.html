Squish level 120 to level 40, we will be questing to level 50 first then after 9.1 to level 60. This is so that 9.0 does not have to be delayed for too long.<br /><br />2. Ability to chat with opposite faction via a new neutral language if we choose to enable it, off by default.<br /><br />3. EU style Union after the battle for Azeroth ends with both sides as losers, players can turn on or off the ability to group with each other, horde/alliance players who choose to side with Sylvanas/Tyrande cannot group with each other, those who do not, can do so. This can always be undone / redone. This does not apply to PVP.<br /><br />4. Complete revamp of the classic trio (Vanila/TBC/Wrath) zones, wrath coming out in patch 9.1. LK returns.<br /><br />5. All zones now scale from 1 to 40. New players can choose to level in any of the previous expansion areas. For example 8 alts, each following a different story line / quests, every time feels like a fresh game from level 1 to 40 + new zones from 40 to 60. The most replayable content WoW has ever had. Mobs now hit as hard as they do in Vanilla and take as long to kill.<br /><br />6. Previous end-game questing zones such as Suramar can now be done while leveling alts, and still barely lead up to level 50.<br /><br />7. Wrath trees are coming back with a few tweaks, current talent system removed, raid drop legendaries with crazy abilities coming back, giving players a reason to want to raid, since similar loot can be obtainable from all kinds of sources, this would differentiate raids from any other source of loot, legendaries being super powerful.<br /><br />8. Original Glyph system is back, this time the player has to buy books that drop in older raids, all of which scale to level 60, giving players a reason to play all raids, not only new ones&hellip;.raid scaling is off by default (setting them at level 40, xmog/mount runs still possible), glyphs only drop from scaled raids.<br /><br />9.Flying is now auto-enabled once 9.1 content is completed, no more gating.<br /><br />10. Friendly AI NPCs can be used to do old raids, LFR is only enabled for current content raids without AI. AI-based raids mean the player can only be a healer/tank in this scenario. If the player dies, GG. DPS players get a generic tank or healer ability bar.<br /><br />11. Non-rated BGS can now be done against AI if the player is also using an AI based team, however they give half as much honor and are challenging to win. Basically 1 real player on each side + 9 AI.<br /><br />12. Solo Q for Rated BGs finally in! Players are treated just like in non-rated, however they only get matched with players of a similar rating. Unrated PVP is once again used for honor-based gear, while rated is only used for titles, cosmetic gear and mounts.<br /><br />13. Ability to unlock new allied races via cash shop<br /><br />14. Class rotations back to having more buttons and abilities since the redesign is based on Wrath classes, with class identity being brought back. Possible class changes include spell skins tied to race and a new hero class.<br /><br />15. WoW 10.0 will feature a new faction with completely new races and lore, without splitting the player base...in other words a new faction only lore-wise, can pve with and pvp against both at-war horde/alliance (pro Sylvanas/Tyrande) or at-peace horde/alliance.<br /><br />The third faction will follow the same new system of "for war" or "for peace" choice (Sylvanas horde vs Tyrande Alliance=for war), basically only a new faction lore-wise, not gameplay wise and therefore will not split the player base any more than along the lines of war and peace between the factions . Basically the point is to expand the pvp system and create more pvp-centerend lore and events, the same is true for the pve game. In the end players get a richer pvp / pve overall game experience. Ultimately allowing players to distinguish themselves between being PVP focused and PVE focused. PVE is defensive minded players fighting forces that threaten the world, PVP is offensive minded players fighting each other.<br /><br />This third faction would give players the choice of being neutral to horde/alliance, without siding with Sylvanas/Tyrande or Baine/Anduin.<br /><br />I have to say that we were both drunk at a party while having this conversation. So, I don't believe any of it. Do you?</p>
