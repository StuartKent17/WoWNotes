Developer Interviews<br>
Today&apos;s interview is with Tom Chilton (Lead Game Designer) on ArenaJunkies (http://www.arenajunkies.com/news/582-arena-junkies-interviews-tom-chilton-lead-wow-game-designer/). A summary of the main points is below, but listening to the full interview is worth it if you want to hear the full answers!<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;object width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;240&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/dq7cw8bpEec?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/dq7cw8bpEec?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Steps are being taken to balance healers, especially Shaman, in PvP. This is being done incrementally to avoid a knee jerk reaction and going too far in one direction. Moving totems back into the schools of magic was one of the changes to bring them more in line.<br>
Discipline Priests and Monks will be buffed somewhat to bring them up to par. We should expect to see those changes on the Patch 5.2 PTR soon.<br>
War Games will be possible Cross realm at some point in the future when time allows for the change.<br>
It may be possible to ban one arena map in the future, similar to the map banning in random battlegrounds.<br>
Part of the reason Tol&apos;vir was added was to increase the chance of getting the Nagrand style map. It also is nice to have a change of scenery rather than just getting Nagrand more often.<br>
Burst damage is still too high, making healing too high as well. Once burst comes down, the healing can be decreased as well.<br>
One of the goals for WoW as an esport is to make it easier to watch. Part of this will be accomplished by making it easier for addon authors to create nice tournament UIs.<br>
The DotA style battleground is still on hold, waiting for new tech to be worked on.<br>
MMR works pretty well for matching people up, but preventing the exploits that have popped up is difficult when keeping the system balanced for all levels of players. Blizzard will keep watching for exploits and taking appropriate action. <br>
WoW was never built from the ground up to be an easy to watch and perfectly balanced eSport, so the improvements that can be made are limited. That being said, Blizzard wants to keep improving things as much as possible. <br>
When asked about arena balance: Burst is too high, non burst damage is too low, there are some disparities between the different healers with Shaman / Paladin being good, Druids being okay, and Discipline Priests and Monks lagging a little bit, and the amount of offensive instant cast crowd control being used.<br>
Blizzard likes the player run tournaments and is evaluating what they can or should do to support them.<br>
PvP Power worked out really well, with players able to use their PvP gear in PvE. Using PvE gear to start PvPing isn&apos;t working quite as well, as it was intended to be able to take raid gear and start PvPing without feeling like you were very fragile and dying very quickly.<br>
Blizzard likes when the PvP and PvE part of the game operate the same, but is willing to make them work differently to make the game work better. <br>

WoWkemon Addon<br>
Today we are taking a quick look at the WoWkemon (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/wowkemon) addon. It replaces the normal pet battle interface with one that will be familiar to anyone that has played Pok&#xE9;mon before. You can see what it looks like in the video or screenshots below. Another nice addon to use with it is Pet Battle Pokemon Mod (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/pet-battle-pokemon-music), which will add some of the classic Pok&#xE9;mon music to pet battles.<br>

Trinket Burst Damage Adjustments<br>
Instead of addressing the strong classes<br>
I just want to point out that this is only one step in a process. We will continue to assess classes and individual abilities and make adjustments as necessary. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/247386-trinket-burst-damage-adjustments/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7338813820?page=10#196))<br>
<br>
Trinket Burst Damage Adjustments<br>
Seems a buff for frost dk&apos;s, and if human they can align proc with on use and PoF... <br>
You could say the same for several classes where this will help them to align their trinkets with their damaging abilities more often. However smaller burst every 60 seconds is a lot easier to survive than a much larger burst every two minutes. <br>
<br>
The same goes for players that play human, they could take two of these trinkets and cycle them every 30 seconds with their burst abilities. Do not forget though, if a human wants to take advantage of these changed on-use trinkets will need to take two of them and give up the not-nerfed proc trinket.<br>
<br>
The idea is good, but what gona happen with the proc trinkets? <br>
I just answered that above for you. At this time we have no plans to be nerfing the proc trinkets, but this may change in the future.<br>
<br>
But, an idea would be to increase resilience on the &quot;tweaked&quot; trinkets by; I don&apos;t know, maybe 20-25% to make them more attractive compared to PvE trinkets etc.! <br>
We&apos;re fairly certain that it&apos;s unlikely for players to start using PvE trinkets because they would suffer a significant loss in PvP power and resilience. Do understand that we will be keeping a very close eye on the situation when this hotfix goes live and, if necessary, make the appropriate adjustments where we see they&apos;re required. This doesn&apos;t mean that the change we make would be to increase the resilience on trinkets like you suggested above, however if we do plan to make further adjustments we will let you know about them.

<br>
Updating Old Content<br>
I often wondered why blizzard doesn&apos;t take advantage of the content people loved. Sure, new content and raids are fun but how much time would it really take to upgrade Kara to current gear levels.<br>
<br>
I mean why in gods name wouldn&apos;t you do things like this, the Ony upgrade was great but even now its outdated by two expansions. The scarlet monastery was good but you didn&apos;t even have to redesign the dungeon, just leave them as they were. <br>
<br>
Can you imagine if Apple decided to completely change the Iphone every release? Sure a few things are changed on each version but the core design, style, and functionality are all there and people still flock to get the latest version. Why is that, its because they have a good thing going.<br>
I&apos;m going to sound a bit like a broken record, so forgive me, but when we are working on updates to the game, we&apos;re looking at what works well for the ongoing development of it. Sometimes that means taking a look at previous content and updating, and sometimes it means leaving it as it is. Overall though, it&apos;s about where we want to take things next, what fits into the larger scheme of development, what can we devote resources to comfortably and still deliver the best possible experience we can in a reasonably solid time frame. <br>
<br>
There are a lot of things that people keep bringing up that they&apos;d like to see again, or revisit in a new and fresh way. We&apos;re not unaware of this. But, at the same time, we have to keep asking ourselves, &quot;Does it make sense and if it does make sense, does it make sense right now?&quot; In contrast, there are those detractors who are often upset when we do go back and refresh content. In some cases it&apos;s because they&apos;re new enough that they haven&apos;t seen it yet, in others it&apos;s because they feel we should leave well enough alone, and to others yet who feel that it&apos;s a development &quot;cop out&quot; and a mere recycling effort. That&apos;s not to say that these things aren&apos;t possibilities &quot;someday&quot;, but what seems simple to you may not be quite so simple as all that. <br>
<br>
An example of updating things on a very large scale, is Cataclysm. There was so much work done from the starting quests to the environments to the very flight paths, but to those who didn&apos;t go through the refreshed content, it was a &quot;waste&quot; of time. We also then had what many felt was far too little at the upper end of content for them. So, despite best efforts to refresh a significant amount of content, not everyone was pleased with it once the immediate blush was off the rose. What we must fight against is time, nostalgia, &quot;What do I get to do/take part in?&quot;, or even &quot;where&apos;s my challenge?&quot; So, no, it&apos;s not as easy as that. In a perfect world, maybe it would be.

<br>
Class Forums and Blue Posts<br>
Do blue posters avoid class forums? If so - why? <br>
The main reason that we don&apos;t make responses in the class forum is because if we post in the forum of class A, then classes B through K will start complaining about favoritism or something similar. While we may not post in threads on the class forums, we do pay attention to the opinions and feedback presented there.<br>
<br>
And where are we supposed to turn in order to get the &quot;official&quot; Blizzard PoV on, for example, major nerfs to a certain spec? <br>
These forums are designed and built in order for players to give their feedback and opinions about the current state of our games or even upcoming changes so that it can be relayed to the developers. They are not for the purpose of having a direct line of communication and discussion with blue posters. If we have some information that we can provide, we will post it, but you should not be actively searching for this as the forums are for you as the players to bring up and discuss topics.<br>
<br>
Do we really have to post immature, whiny post in order to get attention? <br>
Definitely not. As said above, if we have information on a given topic of discussion we will provide it. We are also more inclined to do this with more well written and presented threads rather than ranty or &quot;whiny&quot; posts.<br>
<br>
you&apos;re on EU forums enough said. Blizzard doesn&apos;t care about you, they don&apos;t want your opinion, the blue post always say the same thing. It is always sad for us to see these types of comments because it is something that is simply so far from the truth, it is unreal. The European community team work tirelessly to forward on and present your feelings, feedback and opinions on to the developers.

Blue Tweets<br>
Questing<br>
Your ridiculously gated rep AND VP system for gear cost me one of my raid leaders and you a sub. Just an FYI.<br>
players quit for a variety of reasons. We&apos;re sad when they do, but can&apos;t be held hostage to &quot;change X or I quit.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270300363557588992))<br>
No Greg, but if a lot of peple quit for a reason and a lot of us dont quit but dont enjoy it, then somthg is wrong<br>
of course. That&apos;s why hearing feedback is so important to us. In fact, it&apos;s more useful than threats. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270303607075782656))<br>
If your reaction and filtering of feedback wasn&apos;t so slow compared to other games, you wouldn&apos;t get threats.<br>
A poor justification I&apos;m afraid. Good arguments win arguments, not threats of consequences. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270635563302932482))<br>
<br>
I dont understand why rep grind has to be one way. Let questers do dailies, raiders do dungeons and pvpers pvp...<br>
We want players out in the world. We don&apos;t think WoW will have enough legs as an instance only game. Convenient != best design. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/268408928134635520))<br>
<br>
Mate, don&apos;t let the &quot;rep tabard&quot; brigade get you down. We&apos;re better off shedding instance only players from the playerbase.<br>
Well, we don&apos;t want to shed anyone. Concern is that instance-only is convenient short term but causes loss of interest in the long. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/269173320509956096))<br>
<br>
Making dailies a requirement for rep seems like a VERY poor way to get people out of cities and make the world feel populated.<br>
What do you want to do out in the world? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/269168637494050816))<br>
<br>
For the love of god don&apos;t buckle to the &quot;we are forced to do dailies&quot; minority. Don&apos;t change a thing!!!<br>
it&apos;s just a question of volume. 12 quests a day isn&apos;t bad with some optionals. Doing GL and Klaxxi every day felt like a lot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/269887306847096832))<br>
<br>
Well I&apos;ll just try asking again tomorrow, I realize you&apos;re busy. If you see this tweet, check my profile for the initial ?<br>
we&apos;ve heard a lot of feedback on dailies, and we&apos;ll likely try some tweaks to keep players out in the world but address concerns. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270303366964445184))<br>
<br>
For 5.1 can we have a short term (20min?) LFR buff that simulates the rep tabards for the last rep we did dailies with today?<br>
Talking about some ideas. So long as someone can&apos;t finish rep in one weekend by chain running, we&apos;re open to it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270631060541435904))<br>
<br>
Classes<br>
So many classes and specs are overpowered right now, why won&apos;t you apply hotfixes rather than waiting months for patch 5.1?<br>
We can&apos;t hotfix everything and it&apos;s frustrating for players to constantly suspect ninja nerfs. We hotfix egregious stuff. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270631617670836224))<br>

Alot of people were complaining about &quot;Stampede&quot;. Not the Bestial Wrath ability. Critical mistake on your end<br>

talent system is awesome btw. Way better than anything before.<br>
We agree. A few talents aren&apos;t quite there but the system is much better IMO. I see players changing talents for the first time. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/269886273429319680))<br>
<br>
As a rouge i have problems getting a clean opner in arena and duel because of the amount of aoe effects in the game. toughts?<br>
TBH, it kind of bugs me personally that AEs are so efficient at breaking stealth. Would be a huge change to revert though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/269496985835417601))<br>
<br>
Ever thought of smaller patch changes? Like changing an ability dmg in 5% increments a week instead of 25% all at once?<br>
One risk of small changes is players don&apos;t notice. Flashy changes can sometimes get players to try a class / talent / strat. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270635982569750529))<br>

Any word on healing mushrooms? They are pretty useless but have so much potential.<br>

Did static mana pools really gave you the freedom you needed to design better enocunters? Are we balanced?<br>

<br>
And of course, would love to hear how you feel healers compare for PvE and how Mistweavers have played out.<br>
Pretty happy with healer balance overall. MW were too good in 5.0. Raiders discovering Disc now and we have to keep an eye on it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270625352731209728))<br>

In your eyes are Shockadins a legitimate form of Raid DPS, or is that unintentional or unwelcome? Not even sure if its viable.<br>
Holy isn&apos;t a dps spec. We tried to provide some support for players who like it, but it will likely stay a niche. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/269883002887225344))<br>

serious question, does blizzard have numbers on how many people have taken versatility as a talent? I&apos;m betting its VERY low.<br>

Do you not think it&apos;s a little unfair that Fury has never been good in Arena? Other specs had their time to shine except Fury.<br>
