Timewalking Reward Costs<br>
They already tweeted a pretty stand-pat stance about this. Their claim is it&apos;s &quot;meant to take dedication&quot;. I&apos;m not expecting any type of change until after BlizzCon at the earliest.<br>
One of the problems with Twitter as a medium is the lack of space for nuance. There are hundreds of mounts in WoW, and they are obtainable by a wide variety of different means. Some are simple to get, and cheaply bought off vendors; some require great feats of skill like Gladiator and current Mythic raid mounts; some require tremendous luck (e.g. the Elegon mount); and some require long-term effort (e.g. the Violet Proto-Drake from A Long Strange Trip, or Darkmoon Faire prizes). <br>
<br>
Ultimately they are all cosmetic rewards, and Timewalking is designed to be an evergreen system that we will be expanding over the years. Unlike, say, a Tanaan rep mount that clearly was designed to be earned within the scope of this patch, there will be people doing Timewalking (especially as more dungeons, and more expansions&apos; content get added) throughout the future of WoW, and this represents a long-term goal within that framework. <br>
<br>
If you want to rush through dozens of Timewalking dungeons in a short timeframe to be one of the first to get the mount, and you&apos;d find that experience satisfying, then by all means do so. But I certainly wouldn&apos;t say that&apos;s the intended approach here. The 500-Badge quest turn-in is a once-per-event thing (which we definitely could have made clearer), so if you want to take a more measured pace and just do the Timewalking quest each time the event comes around while you happen to otherwise actively be playing, you can get the mount with just a few total hours spent (though over a longer period of real time). It&apos;s up to you. In the meantime, there are other items (notably some great alt catch-up gear) available through the system, and those are much more attainably priced.<br>
<br>
<br>
Accolade Trinkets and PvP Gearing<br>
We do not plan to put the random-stat Accolade trinkets on the vendors.<br>
<br>
However, we did uncover a bug that was causing them to provide twice the secondary stat bonus than was intended. That bug was corrected in patch 6.2.2.<br>
<br>
Frankly (speaking for myself as a player, and not for the development team), I&apos;m not convinced that the Accolade trinkets are all they&apos;re cracked up to be.<br>
<br>
The Wild Gladiator&apos;s Accolade of Dominance provides 403 Intellect and 403 Versatility in PvP combat. The Insignia provides 469 Versatility and a 20-second 1330 Intellect proc. In sustained combat, it tends to proc around every 60 seconds, giving it roughly a 33% uptime for an average benefit of ~440 Intellect.<br>
<br>
Combine that with the fact that you have to actually be damaging someone for it to proc (which increases the effective uptime by cutting out sections where you&apos;re not hitting anyone) and the increased burst potential by allowing you to use your hardest-hitting abilities while it&apos;s active... and I&apos;d argue that for the vast majority of players the proc trinket is easily better.<br>
<br>
Granted, you might want a different secondary stat which isn&apos;t available on the Insignia. In that case I would argue that the difference between 469 Versatility and, lets say, 403 Mastery would be EXTREMELY minor at best.<br>
<br>
I could also see an argument for those who are playing Humans, in which case you&apos;d likely be comparing the Accolades to the Badges (the on-use trinkets) instead of the Insignias. As you can probably imagine, buffing Humans isn&apos;t exactly high on our priority list at the moment.<br>
<br>
All that said, I won&apos;t pretend for a second that I&apos;m the best Arena player, and these are obviously just my personal opinions. I&apos;m just not seeing what makes the Accolade trinkets so incredibly attractive that they&apos;re absolutely mandatory to the point that it&apos;s worth doing content you don&apos;t enjoy for a chance to get hold of one.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m not really defending RNG PvP gearing, and I think the actions the development team has taken since 6.2 released speak pretty well to say that the devs aren&apos;t happy with the way it worked initially either. And I totally understand why it&apos;s frustrating that those actions aren&apos;t extending to the Accolade trinkets. All I&apos;m saying is that, if you really don&apos;t like Ashran, just don&apos;t do it. There are other trinket options, and they&apos;re -- at worst -- still pretty good.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I should also mention again that I&apos;m really only speaking on behalf of myself and the way I enjoy the game. Just trying to have a conversation here. <br>

Blue Tweets<br>
If you talk about &quot;bad people on the internet&quot;, what kind of people do you refer to? Those who are critical? Those who threaten?<br>
Those who cross a line. No one minds critique. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/637421625311232000))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Hey GC, got any thoughts on Health of the Game vs Player enjoyment? I always feel bad about Cata heroic difficulty caving.<br>
I could write volumes on this. Players respect sticking by your guns to an extent, but at some point it becomes out of touch. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/636962886250721281))<br>
<br>
Developer Communication<br>
Is there substantial data to suggest that dev/player communication results in higher sales and retention?<br>
No, I don&apos;t believe so, which is why it is so controversial inside studios, e.g. Valve doesn&apos;t seem to value it much. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/636963509864009728))<br>
<br>
miss the dev watercooler that blizz did to keep peeps informed. was concise and it came from one source. was that your idea?<br>
I can&apos;t recall. I worked on it a lot with Bashiok and Zarhym. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/636901216291651584))<br>
Do you remember how many hours of discussion, drafting, revision and review went into each one, on average?<br>
I tend to write very fast, which is why I can do all of this. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/636963066811252736))<br>
A blog might take 2 hours depending on topic. No idea on editing. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/636963127502897152))<br>

Poll - What a Long, Strange Trip It&apos;s Been<br>
The post covering rewards talked about the What a Long, Strange Trip It&apos;s Been (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/2144-what-a-long-strange-trip-its-been) achievement and mount, so we decided to see how active players are doing towards obtaining the Violet Proto-Drake (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/60024-violet-proto-drake). Only 15.8% of players have earned the achievement! Have you completed the achievement yet? <br>
