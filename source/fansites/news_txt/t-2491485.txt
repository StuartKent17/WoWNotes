MagicFind2019-06-11, 11:04 PMBFA Season 2 Ending Soon
Heads up! The current season of activities in Mythic Keystone Dungeons and PvP is ending soon.

This will mean an end to all playersâ€™ opportunities to earn seasonal rewards and titles, as well as the end of seasonal rankings for BFA Season 2.

For two weeks following the end-of-season, we will have an off-season. During that two weeks period, Mythic Keystone dungeons will still be playable using Season 2 affixes and rewards, but their seasonal achievements will no longer be available. In PvP during that two week period, players still queue for rated PvP and earn appropriate rewards, but the PvP leaderboards will be locked.

Good luck fighting to a glorious finish of the season!
