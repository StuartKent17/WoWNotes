Rated Battlegrounds<br>
you can say: wait? what the difference with Random battlegrounds? <br>
Indeed and that is exactly the issue. Rated BG&apos;s have higher rewards than random BG&apos;s because of the organisation that is involved in getting the group together and coordinating them for success against another organised group. <br>
<br>
Also you are always forced to go on a communication program like teamspeak what not everyone likes to do. <br>
This is one of the parts involved in trying to run an organised group, not all information can be given through chat, especially quick commands for targets and CC. This is not to say it&apos;s required, but it&apos;s definitely recommended to improve your chances of victory.<br>
<br>
So when you hit 90, and want to pvp. you first have to farm all honor gear, witch is a REAL REAL PAIN to do. Because everything 2 shots you and you hit like a wet towel. <br>
The damage received by freshly dinged players is generally the same as those who are fully geared, depending on what you gem and enchant. This is because of the implementation of base resilience to all players. The main difference is the damage or healing you do, but that doesn&apos;t mean that you&apos;re unable to contribute.<br>
<br>
And random BG&apos;s is swarmed with bot&apos;s. i&apos;m not even start talking about this. <br>
I&apos;ll just touch on it quickly and say that we are constantly dealing with the issue of bots and are doing everything we can to lower and remove the impact they have on your experience in World of Warcraft. Also; if bots are something that concerns you in random BG&apos;s, then creating a queuing system for rated BG&apos;s would also feed this across to the conquest grind as well.<br>
<br>
We understand that there are benefits behind having a queue for rated BG&apos;s and that there are people that would like to see this implemented, but we also feel that there are more positives than negatives behind keeping it restricted to premade groups only. This is not to say that the discussion is closed, we greatly appreciate any feedback that you have on the subject.

Professions<br>
Made an account just to ask this; Are there any plans to update crafting professions to keep up with the leveling process?<br>
Yes, but no immediate announcements. We agree it&apos;s a problem. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/370982752616607744))<br>
<br>
are we definetly going to see the sky golem next patch? <br>
I can never say definitely until the patch ships, because sometimes there are last minute changes. At the moment, it looks good. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372172127383736323))<br>
<br>
UI / Addons<br>
I wonder, do you use addons for raiding or you&apos;re confident about original UI? #notgoingtoabuseyoureanswer<br>
It varies. I&apos;m responsible for UI so I feel an obligation to experience the game sans mods. I like to see why mods are popular too. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/371347556053180416))<br>
I&apos;d argue (and do, as a game designer and lecturer) that WoW&apos;s mods are important - can config UI as people like!<br>
Oh, totally agree. I meant specific mods that gain a lot of popularity. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372081859447902208))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
Concerned about valor points in 5.4... got 11 90&apos;s running out of stuff to buy in 5.3, so what will we spend valor on in 5.4?<br>
Upgrading your best gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/369122544189599746))<br>
<br>
ok so dumb question....why is it harder to get justice points than it is to get valor points?<br>
We didn&apos;t do at great job of integrating justice points into the MoP reward tapestry. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/371727328583233536))<br>
<br>
Why no mastery at low level? Shouldn&apos;t players have more time to get used to stat effects/usefulness?<br>
We find new and low level players have plenty of things to learn. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373174424247087105))<br>
<br>
Why no siege weapons have no cool procs?<br>
We wanted the heirlooms (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/weapons?filter-patch=3388&amp;filter-bind=10) to be very competitive, which would be tough if there were procs competing with them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372172599733665792))<br>
Procs are cool. We will do them again. The SoO trinkets (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/armor/trinkets?filter-patch=3388) are pretty cool in the meantime. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372172679228313600))<br>
<br>
restricting dailies is a terrible idea. Make the REP they give accountwide, not the quests.<br>
What about the concern that if player X does 100 dailies a day, I have to as well to keep up? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372080666814316545))<br>
I just don&apos;t want to have to unlock the quartermaster 10x over. Is that asking too much?<br>
In vanilla, many of us had 1-2 characters. Now many have 5-10. They don&apos;t want to do something 5-10 times, understandably. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372096013823012864))<br>
We know some players want to be able to raid on all their alts without having to spend much time gearing them up. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372095747195293696))<br>
But if you&apos;re trying to level up alts now, I would skip the quatermasters and do Barrens in 5.3 or Timeless Isle in 5.4. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372095191298998272))<br>
The issue here, as it always is, is how much commitment should the second (and so on) character require? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372095289915473921))<br>
if cataclysm was too alt friendly, I think mop shifted that paradigm slightly too far in the other direction.<br>
We agree with that. Our main goal for MoP was to make sure players always had plenty to do. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372165698467790848))<br>
If you have one character, that should work fine for you. If you have five, I can see how it was overwhelming. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372165802473975808))<br>
5.4 is pretty alt-friendly though, in the same way the final patch of past expansions were. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372166021303369728))<br>
Our goal is to make the second take less than the first, but still not zero. We know that won&apos;t make some players happy. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372095381703634944))<br>
Which quartermaster is a problem? If you had to do it 5 times in 5.0, then that is a problem, as we&apos;ve said. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372095086399467520))<br>
Blacksmith needs Klaxxi. Tailor/Enchanter August Celestials. LW need Golden Lotus. Thank you for listening. <br>
Does it demean your effort if every player with several 90s had access to all those recipes once they did it on 1 character? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372097555657531392))<br>
<br>
Honestly all I want is my Cloud Serpent Riding.<br>
We might change the riding requirement to account-wide in 5.4. Feels like it has served its purpose. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/371354803005165568))<br>
<br>
Expansions every year in future? So people who hate leveling should just quit? FYI leveling is awful for some.<br>
It is a problem for sure. We lose a lot of folks who never make it to max level (or even expansion min level). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372094515756011520))<br>
<br>
Your stated design intent: legendaries useful for a whole expansion. Reality: 5.0-5.1 legs useless in 5.4. Please revise.<br>
I believe that design intent was about weapons. Regardless, your meta gem will still work. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/371739500306628608))<br>
Having every orange item stick around 5.4 would be too much power difference between haves and have nots. It&apos;s huge as it is. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/371739704816697344))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
i&apos;ve been wondering like forever...what does &quot;lead systems designer&quot; entail exactly? i can see many overlaps.<br>
We use systems as in contrast to content. Content does levels and quests. Systems does features and combat. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373525908163817472))<br>
Encounter designers are part of the systems team, largely because they are so combat focused. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373526089731026945))<br>
Overall there is a ton of overlap. A systems designer may help out on pet battles. We all contribute to scenarios. Etc. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373526261315817472))<br>
<br>
I asked what he does focus on as the lead dev, not what should he.<br>
Spend most of my time making sure other designers aren&apos;t blocked, ideas for future content, systems work with programmers. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373512476274348032))<br>
<br>
Because every blue post seems to be &quot;well I don&apos;t think so&quot; or &quot;maybe someday&quot;. If you cant answer something don&apos;t even bother<br>
Players get upset if you never answer but very few of our answers are going to be &quot;We agree! Change incoming!&quot; Kind of a catch 22. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372556625514491904))<br>
<br>
Could make the case that WoW has enough cognitive difficulty that mechanical difficulty in leveling would be wasted<br>
I like leveling being challenging personally. The problem is our attempts to make leveling faster also made it easier. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372555437108760576)<br>
