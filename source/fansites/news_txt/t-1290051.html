<br>
Patch 5.2 Dev Interview<br>
One of the interviews we didn&apos;t have time to cover in the past is the EPIC Podcast (http://www.epicpodcast.com/imported-20110407170325/2013/2/28/episode-111-in-which-dave-gives-a-history-lesson.html) interview with Cory Stockton and Dave Kosak.<br>
<br>
<br>
We may see some of Sylvanas before the end of the expansion, but no promises.<br>
Pet battle PvP was designed to remove any fear of PvP, no communication with the other player, no win/loss record, etc.<br>
A future patch might start tracking pet battle PvP wins and add a quest to win 10 PvP pet battles every week.<br>
Blizzard was surprised by how popular and well received pet battles were. The participation rate is very high.<br>
Patch 5.3 adds the first set of Burning Crusade raid boss pet drops (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/battle-pets?filter-bp-source=1&amp;filter-patch=16758), and a future patch will have the second set.<br>
Pet gender was added in case it wanted to be used later, but currently the team is happy with the current depth the pet battle system has.<br>
When adding tech for Burning Crusade Heroic Dungeons, the team added support for ten versions of a NPC with for varying difficulties, thinking they would never use that many. Mists of Pandaria now uses six!<br>
Pet battles added Lesser Charms as a reward in Patch 5.2, and it is possible that we may see more rewards like this in the future, including Valor Points.<br>
The new scenario into stories (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z98xdIO01dQ) were added so that you can see the lore once, and then enjoy the scenario after that without repeating the lore every time.<br>
The Determination (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/139068-determination) buff came from seeing groups wipe once or twice and leaving and then queuing again. This contributed to the problem of entering a raid that was partially completed and made for an unpleasant LFR environment. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Blizzard &lt;3s Bad Robot<br>
We finally have a source for the Bad Robot pet from the Patch 5.3 PTR!<br>

<br>
One of the core values we live by here at Blizzard is &#x201C;Embrace Your Inner Geek.&#x201D; We play countless games, we collect comics and card games, we love cutting-edge technology and computer hardware, we&#x2019;re fascinated by science and discovery, and many of us are movie buffs. Movies represent the combined imaginations of talented writers and visionaries, artists and operators, editors and producers, that can culminate in an awesome cinematic experience.<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s with this motivation that we express our respect for JJ Abrams&apos; Bad Robot Productions (http://www.badrobot.com/).<br>
<br>
Coming in a future patch, characters with the Engineering profession will be able to produce this mechanical homage to the company that brought us award-winning television shows like Lost and Fringe, and are continuing the epic Star Trek and forthcoming Star Wars film sagas. Everyone has a chance to get their hands on this pet, allowing them to show off their mutual appreciation for Bad Robot, and the stories they&#x2019;ve brought to our TVs and movie screens.<br>
<br>
We hope everyone enjoys this new pet!<br>

Live WoW Developer Q&amp;A Thursday, April 25<br>
Good people of Azeroth, lend me your eyes!<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll be hosting a live World of Warcraft developer Q&amp;A open to the community on Thursday, April 25 from 5:30-6:30 p.m. PDT. Designers Dave Kosak, Ion Hazzikostas, Brian Holinka, Cory Stockton, and Greg Street will be available to field your questions about Mists of Pandaria gameplay and design, patch 5.2 and beyond. This will be a moderated chat on the Cover it Live platform hosted on the front page of our official site. Community managers Bashiok, Crithto, Daxxarri, Rygarius, and I will be there to filter your submissions for the developers.<br>
<br>
We receive thousands of questions each time we host these events, so please be patient with us and bear in mind that we won&#x2019;t get to every question. You can help by keeping your inquiries concise and focused on one topic per entry. Submissions that are well over 200 characters, or contain multiple questions on an array of topics, are much less likely to receive responses. We want to cover as much ground as possible and appreciate your assistance in helping us to achieve that.<br>
<br>
We look forward to chatting with you on Thursday!<br>

Ask the Devs Questions<br>
boring, they seem to have picked the questions (again) that they have easy copy/paste answers ready. <br>
The questions chosen were the ones that were on the topic in question, which was the upcoming PvP changes in patch 5.3. No questions were skipped because of their difficulty in answering. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/259206-ask-the-devs-53-ptr-edition/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7339364527?page=1#4))<br>

[PvE] Why casters never have to worry about going OOM and warriors struggle for rage? Casters spam what they want, no downside<br>
Why do warriors have no cast bars (but one) and mages must stop and cast? Class mechanics work differently. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323148202805190657))<br>
<br>
What made Rets need a buff? Not that I&apos;m QQing or anything, but my Unholy DK would like some too.<br>
Unholy is doing great right now IMO. Ret was average on some fights, low on others, and didn&apos;t have a good fight to shine. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322814237858742272))<br>

is Solar Beam included in glyph of omens ? official notes says yes, mmo-champ says no.<br>
No, Solar Beam is not in Glyph of Omens because it&apos;s off the GCD. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322885790696869888))<br>

just want to say stupid move on the hunter changes in 5.3. even more stuns for any spec. not fun when you get perma stunlock<br>
They have to give up Silencing Shot to take the stun. Not sure you&apos;ll see that many take that trade. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324323644710981635))<br>

15% Sword of Light on live right now to 30% on PTR huge, if you think that&apos;s needed why not a hotfix? 5% would be okay to wait<br>
These are just changes we&apos;re trying out on the test realm. We need to evaluate data and feedback before 5.3 goes live. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322878501571141632))<br>

Hey ! Don&apos;t you think Holy paladins in PVP are a little bit underpowered compared to other healers atm?<br>
They were too good last season, but dropped off a lot. Also had good synergy with warriors, which is a factor. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323950661903450117))<br>
high % doesn&apos;t mean good, shamans / priests are good, work in every comp and that&apos;s not &quot;synergy&quot; with every class<br>
There are many ways to measure it: rep, number of viable teams, pure power. Ultimately we concluded they were too strong. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324328242133753857))<br>
<br>
That&apos;s because it actually gives 1 HP on cast while aiding in raid healing. More HP = more EFs = more ST healing.<br>
If you need the HR to actually heal, that&apos;s one thing, but it shouldn&apos;t be simply a Holy Power delivery mechanism. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324326245519200258))<br>
But HR is only transferring 15% to the tank, while DL on the tank gives you 100% and Holy Power. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324326087209402368))<br>
<br>
Making Holy Radiance reset the cooldown of Holy Shock would make everything better.<br>
Concerned that would force Holy Radiance into a single-target rotation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323951607043719169))<br>
Holy Radiance is already best for a single target rotation. HR + HS does more healing than DL + HS.<br>
Which is silly. Daybreak should never be a single target throughput increase. HR alone is weaker than DL, as it should be. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324323036692115457))<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#U))<br>
Exactly this. Give us something better to do as a filler. How about renew, binding, etc changes?<br>
&quot;Better to cast&quot; sounds like Atonement HPS is beating actual heals. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323953484628099074))<br>
Disc healing is underpowered w/o atonement (absorbs /= heal), time for grace to be on priest not the target?!<br>
But absorbs are generally more powerful than heals so it makes sense they aren&apos;t as strong point for point. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324326584741949440))<br>
If Disc can heal as well as anyone and has absorbs on top of that, why play anything else? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324326661833232384))<br>

Why Enhancement and not Elemental? Enhancement damage is insane right now as is, our ENH Sham beats me and we have same ilvl<br>
Overall, Elemental is going better than Enhance, and Elemental is getting a buff through LB cast time. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322758570598875136))<br>

I don&apos;t understand all of these &quot;animation limitations&quot; for TG and XMog (daggers/fist weapons) - is it really that difficult?<br>
Actually, yes. Animation requires a specific set of skills and talent for a developer, and a lot of work. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323145640081240064))<br>
My hunch is many players have a grasp for what modeling and texturing are like, but animation is more of a black box. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323145866376511489))<br>
<br>
but strength polearms with be back again soon right? RIGHT?!<br>
We&apos;d like to do more Str polearms even if we can&apos;t sort out TG (which we hopefully can). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322809298822524928))<br>
and as i have countless times tried to suggest every way possible, why not make PvP str Polearms?<br>
There is a PvP Str polearm on the list for 5.4. No promises of course. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323144350932537344))<br>
<br>
With the addition of the new warrior specialization ability, will we see the similar effect attached to second wind go away?<br>
Yes. Trying Second Wind just as heals to potentially open up the other talent choices since you get the rage no matter what. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322880400873644033))<br>
