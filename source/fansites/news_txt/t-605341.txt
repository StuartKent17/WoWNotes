PTR changes
A few changes have been made to PTRs
It looks like you can now "collide" with NPCs on the PvP tournament server, other players can't "sit" on top of the NPC to prevent other people to click it anymore.
You can now inspect players from the opposite faction. But it won't work if they're hostile/PvP Flagged
You can now join EU/US/KR PTRs with the same account !



New test servers - PvP Tournaments
The test tournament realm is a test of the new PVP Tournament realms you will not be able to copy characters there instead you will be able to create a level 70 and choose the equipment you want for PVP.

Sunwell boss dialogues - Full transcript
The latest PTR build included all the sound files related to boss encounters in the Sunwell Plateau, and we learn a few more things about the two bosses remaining in Sunwell Plateau : M'uru/Entropius and Kil'jaeden.
As speculated a few days ago in this post http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=4655.0, Entropius is indeed the evil form of M'uru see Velen and Lady Liadrin dialogues. 
Anveena sacrifices herself [spell=46474] during the fight against Kil'jaeden, Kalecgos is here to help the players and it sounds like the fight will have at least 4 phases, one of them involving Kalecgos empowering orbs to help you.
