Brawler's Guild Updates
The Horde Brawler's Guild was updated in the latest PTR patch, making it less plain looking. It is clearly still in the middle of changes, as a wall is missing and some NPCs are floating. Milhouse Manastorm will be making his return as one of the harder bosses you get to fight!

Pet Battle Rankings
If pet battles are not already exciting enough for you, maybe these rankings will help. WoWProgress added pet battle rankings http://www.wowprogress.com/petscore/ this week, based on http://www.wowprogress.com/post/123_How_Strong_is_Your_Battle_Pet_Army%3F the number, quality, and level of the pets you have collected. The top ranked players are nearing 20 rare level 25 pets!

Along with this, we updated WoWDB http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/battle-pets to show the level at which pets learn a skill, which pets can learn a skill, if a pet can be traded or not http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/battle-pets?filter-can-battle=0, if a pet can battle or not http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/battle-pets?filter-can-battle=0, if a pet is unique or not http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/battle-pets?filter-unique=1, and more!

Mists of Pandaria Flying for Alts
WTB Book of Pandaren Flying BoA - requires level 90 to purchase = 2400gold, PST.
We're not sure if we'll be doing this. The tome worked out well enough for Wrath of the Lich King as an experiment, but so much of the experience we spent a lot of time and effort shaping in Pandaria is negated by flying. In addition to the upcoming reputation changes for alts when a character on the account hits Revered, we'll consider other methods of potentially speeding up the leveling process for alts, but we don't think "allow flying" is necessarily the best answer.

Blingtron 4000
"The Blingtron 4000 will be fully stocked with a variety of fun items such as Party Grenades, but even better than that, it has a chance a very, very small one to give the gift of an Engineering mount or pet."

Does that include the Depleted-Kyparium Rocket and Geosynchronous World Spinner
You are perceptive. There is a very small non-zero chance for a mount or pet from the Blingtron 4000 Gift Package http://www.wowdb.com/items/86623-blingtron-4000-gift-package. We heard you like bling so your pal Blingtron may be getting some minor upgrades to their bling in an upcoming patch.

Players Botting
But why would Blizzard ban bots?
They have a active subscription and pay money.
Why would any company reduce their own income on purpose?
It doesn't make sense... Allthough I don't like so many bots either.
But for them to actualy ban most of them, and lose out on so much money 
from the botter's subscription.. Would they realy do that. I don't know.
I think Nevalistis summed this up quite well: This is one of the biggest misconceptions we have, and I genuinely wish we could permanently clear it up. I'll provide a few hypothetical situations mind you, these numbers are ENTIRELY made up.

Let's say 90% of botters were compromised accounts. This means that 90% of these botters aren't paying accounts; they're stolen accounts, which are generally fueled by stolen credit cards. These payments usually get disputed and taken back, which actually costs us money. If we're looking to make a purely fiscal observation, it makes no financial sense to let these continue aside from the fact that we don't like compromised accounts to begin with - we want our players to be playing their own accounts safely and enjoyably.

Let's go on the other side of the fence and say 90% of these botters were otherwise legitimate players paying for their accounts, as you purport. When players bot, other players are inconvenienced by this behavior and trust me, you guys outnumber the botters, even if you may feel it's the other way around. The inconveniences range from normal players having difficulty farming on their own to struggling to keep up with an economy that's being forcibly fluctuated via unfair advantage. When players are inconvenienced in this manner, they submit petitions. 

Every petition submitted goes to a Game Master for review. A living, breathing person that is paid to provide customer service looks over it, does what's necessary for the situation in botting cases, usually forwarding the info on to our exploitation/hacks team, and provides a response. Let's say 1-2 people are inconvenienced by a single botter in all likelihood, we probably get many more petitions per botter than that. This would mean each botter is inconveniencing at least as many, and likely more, players that are positive to the community the kinds of players we like and want to continue to play our game. For each botter we allow to continue botting, we potentially stand to lose more than we gain for a single subscription, just out of the sheer inconvenience it causes other players.

Even if you change those numbers around of legitimate players versus compromised accounts - we only stand to lose more if we don't take action on bots which we do, regularly.

And that's probably the problem. If I can stand in front of a guy who's botting who has about as many achievement points as me, then the only reason why he dares to bot is because he does not feel there is a risk of losing anything by doing so.

And the worst part is that right now it's difficult to say that he isn't right.
Those who choose to believe they are above detection range far and wide, I’m sure. Possibly because they may have been getting away with it for a time. However, we investigate every single bot report that comes in. We don't usually deal with the reports immediately because the underlying issue would remain in place. 

What we do is study the bots, see exactly how they do what they do, and fix it so that they don’t work anymore. Once we’ve applied the fix, then the ban waves take place. By doing it like this, we can also come up with better methods of detection, and devise systems that are more effective against bot detection and removal.

Having said that, it's an on-going fight. Botters develop new bots by working out what we detected and fixed, and it starts all over again. In the process, we’ve ruled out one way of cheating the system though. I can’t go into much more detail without providing botters with information that would help them Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/242016-captcha-to-report-and-automagically-disconnect-botters/ / Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5724064668?page=4#70

Warrior Tanking Feedback
would like to know what about it you like over the cataclysm model.
Getting rage when you use your abilities and not when you get hit and not being constantly at max rage. 
Cata felt a bit spammy, constantly hitting cleave or heroic strike to spend rage was not my favourite thing. This got to the point where some players simply macro’ed HS to devastate because it was out of the GCD and still rarely got rage starved.

I’m really enjoying tanking with my warrior right now, I did enjoy it in Cata as well I must say, but it’s just better now, revenge and shield slam feel great, and you can use the rage that they generate for when you really need to minimize damage taken, or, if you feel confident about your survivability you can use that rage with offensive abilities like heroic strike, but it’s the decision making process that I enjoy, rage doesn’t feel free anymore, you actually have to think and make a trade-off, or even predict when you need to save more rage and build it up for a moment where you know it would be effective and efficient to use a mitigation cooldown like shield barrier or shield block, that’s just good design in my opinion.

Questing
Remove class specific quest rewards? When none of the items are an upgrade, I would always chose the one that sells for most 
They are all worth the same amount now. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261847091696005120

About questing in a raid group: I'm probably missing something, but what is problematic about people forming "questing raids"? 
It is so efficient that it would feel mandatory. Every realm would have a continual Golden Lotus raid etc. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261360432915288065

Will we need to be honored with Wrathion or have to have completed the legendary questline to do his new 5.1 questline? 
Wrathion's Legendary questline in 5.1 is a continuation of the 5.0 quests, so you'll have to do them all! 

Are you guys happy with the daily system playing such a large role in end-game content? 
I think the valor and charms feel good because you can cap them. I think rep itself would be better with a cap. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/260775899430010880

Are you considering changing the reputation system? So many dailies are burning us down from the game. Tabards back?

Why can I not fly in Silvermoon? I cry every time I go back... 
It would take months to fix, which means you'd get less other stuff. Challenging for us to justify. Org hard but still easier. We feel like BEs have been neglected a bit lately. We won't forget them. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261655186521612290

The problem for me is that it's one of the situations you talk a lot about avoiding; taking an existing toy away from players. Loss of increased running speed as a ghost
It's often easy to make players happy in the short term but not the long term, even though the latter is more important.
