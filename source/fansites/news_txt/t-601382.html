The quality (1680x1052 resolution) and the intro are nice and you should download it if you can handle the 400mb size. <br>

I will probably stop posting all the news at once in the same day and will post multiple &quot;small&quot; news instead, this should let you see something new more often if you check the site multiple times in a day, and it will let me talk about &quot;minor&quot; news easier.</div></div>
