Ignore the eyes that blink and stare<br>
Trade pins and badges at the Darkmoon Faire!<br>
<br>
The mysterious Darkmoon Faire returns to BlizzCon this year (North Hall, Level 2), and in addition to all the wondrous sights to behold, you&#x2019;ll discover a host of new trading opportunities for Blizzard Collectible Pins and Badges.<br>
<br>
GET STARTED AT THE GEAR STORE (https://gear.blizzard.com/us/blizzcon)<br>

Blizzard Collectible Pins<br>
The Series 5 pin packs will feature one of 10 new character designs: D.Va, Reaper, McCree, Zarya, Jaina Proudmoore, Saurfang, Mecha Tyrael, Ghost Kerrigan, Crusader, and Ava. Each character has a sculpted gold variant, meaning there&#x2019;s a total of 20 new pins to collect.<br>

<br>
Trading Time<br>
You&#x2019;ve got pins. You&#x2019;ve got badges. It&#x2019;s time to trade! <br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ve expanded the open trading area in the Darkmoon Faire into a Blizzard Bazaar of tables, barrels, and helpful &#x201C;blue shirts&#x201D; to assist attendees in trading any Blizzard collectibles.<br>
<br>
<br>
Pin and Badge Trading Booth<br>
Last year&#x2019;s Pin Trading Booth is doing double duty this year. On one side of the booth, you can queue for pin trading, with badge trading being featured on the other side.<br>
<br>
Rules for the Pin and Badge Trading Booth:<br>
<br>
<br>
Collectors can trade up to two different badges/pins at a time.<br>
Trades are one badge/pin for one badge/pin, respectively.<br>
A gold pin can only be traded for another gold pin.<br>
The pin board will accept any Series 5 pins.<br>
The badge board will accept Series 2 Badge Pack badges and Capsule Toy Badges.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A Trip Through the Timeways<br>
The Timewalkers&#x2019; Trading Post returns to the Darkmoon Faire, and its enigmatic proprietors have procured a brand-new item: the Timewalkers&#x2019; Treasure Chest, a mystery box full of items from BlizzCons past and present. <br>
<br>
Good luck, have fun, and we&#x2019;ll see you at BlizzCon!<br>
