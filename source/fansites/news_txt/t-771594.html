Oh my god Oh my god Oh my god Oh my god.<br>
IRVINE, CA. Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. today announced that the greatest band in the world*, Tenacious D, will perform at the closing concert during this year&#x2019;s sold-out BlizzCon&#xAE;. Taking place October 22-23 at the Anaheim Convention Center, BlizzCon is a celebration of the global player communities surrounding Blizzard Entertainment&#x2019;s Warcraft&#xAE;, Diablo&#xAE;, and StarCraft&#xAE; game universes. While tickets to the convention are currently sold out, viewers can watch at home by ordering a BlizzCon Virtual Ticket, offering over 50 hours of event coverage (including Tenacious D&#x2019;s performance) globally over the Internet and also on DIRECTV&#xAE; in the United States.<br>
<br>
Tenacious D is made up of musical visionaries Jack Black and Kyle Gass. After forming in 1994, the duo rose to rock god-dom following the release of the HBO cult-hit series Tenacious D: The Greatest Band on Earth. Since then, Tenacious D has released two albums and a pair of live DVDs, sold out arenas around the world, and starred in their own feature-length movie, Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny. At the BlizzCon closing ceremony on October 23, the band will perform an earth-shattering set that includes the debut of new, soon-to-be-legendary songs.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The best way to wrap up two days of epic entertainment is with an epic rock concert&#x2014;and few bands fit the bill like Tenacious D,&#x201D; said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re looking forward to a great show and can&#x2019;t wait to see what Jack and Kyle have in store for everyone attending BlizzCon and watching from home.&#x201D;<br>
