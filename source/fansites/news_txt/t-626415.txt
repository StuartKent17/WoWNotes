Changes to TBC and Classic dungeons
We've made some changes to several dungeons to allow easier access for players in the upcoming patch.

The ritual objects that used to require 3 players to activate in Blackrock Spire and Uldaman now only require 1.
You no longer need quintessence to summon Majordomo Executus.
You no longer need the Scepter of Celebras to teleport to the final section of Maraudon.
You no longer need the Mallet of Zul'Farrak to summon Gahz'rilla.
Nightbane is also being made accessible without the urn.

The Scepter and Mallet both turn into actual weapons. The change to the Mallet and Scepter into weapons will also change the existing items. 


Blue posts
Cash for items / TCG
The are no current plans to allow for players to purchase in-game items or gold using real-world money. 

[...] We have made it so that some cosmetic, fun items can be obtained by those purchasing the trading card game. This is called marketing. The more you equate this directly to an imaginary scenario where we provide a system for players to purchase epic items with credit cards, the less likely it is we'll have a need to continue this discussion.

XP Rewards from player kills
It's a possibility for some time in the future, but we don't have anything more on that at this point in time. We mentioned it at Blizzcon as a consideration, however. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/13393671170-please-add-experience-from-killing-players.html

Paid Name Change / Customization / Realm Transfer
These aren't services that are integral to the game. We offer such services purely as a convenience to players, however, we do not feel such features should be standard with the game. For this reason there is a cost associated, partly so that we can maintain these services, and partly to curb the frequency at which they're used. 

[...] We're not keen on the idea of putting functionality in the game where players can pay for plastic surgery. We do, however, understand that making a customization service available to players would be very convenient for some. We developed the tools necessary and brought up the system. Those who feel it's worth changing physical appearance or gender are welcome to do so for a small fee.

Even at that the customization service is limited to the areas we feel have the least amount of impact on the game. Allowing players to change race, faction, or class is something we want to avoid, as this has much more of an impact on everyone's play experience.

In all it's a service. It didn't exist before and now it does. You can choose whether or not it's worth your money. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/13393781451-should-i-really-have-to-pay-extra.html

Class / Race / Faction change
We have made, and are still making changes to the game to make leveling from 1-80 a little easier and encourage re-rolling. With that said, we have no plans right now to allow players to change faction, race, or class. Regardless of what one's stance is on the worth/value of changing cosmetic features such as physical appearance or gender, I think we can agree that altering class, faction, or race would drastically change the core of a character, and ultimately the functionality of the game.

Circle of Healing / Wild Growth nerf
We initially did try the cooldowns in beta and were worried they made the spells less fun. That is definitely still a risk. However, the reason we even talked about the cooldowns to begin with were because the the buttons looked too attractive and the spells made some encounters too easy. We went ahead and removed the cooldowns, but in retrospect, that was the wrong move.

I know it's hard sometimes not to take nerfs personally, but we have to do what we think is best for the game. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13392281541-endless-list-of-cohwg-nerf-hate-yet.html

Are you considering allowing more then 1 DK per server? 
Yes we are considering it. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13392251279-concise-dk-creation-post-lf-answers.html

Glyph changes
I said "many negative effects were removed." I did not say "every glyph was buffed." Death Strike in particular was pretty broken with the glyph. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/13392281694-gc-dk-glyphs-are-much-worse-now--what-gives.html

Bear tanking idol
A Bear tanking idol is indeed needed and we are therefore looking into getting one added to the game Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/7120203329-lack-of-bear-form-tanking-idol.html

Feral Druid Weapons
It will be a slight nerf, but we're talking such a slight nerf that I would be surprised if you noticed it.

An item like the Staff of Trickery would give you a 10 AP loss, or 30 AP with Kings, after this change. 

We use a conversion of 1 Str = 2.33 AP with Survival of the Fittest and Kings. I'm not sure where the extra AP is coming from in the conversion quoted above. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13393670958-feral-druid-weapons.html

Changes to Starfall
We will let you shift from caster to Moonkin form or back without cancelling the spell.

We just didn't want players going cat or travel and racing around with Starfall hitting everything. It is an unusual spell since it requires no channeling and moves with you. We have to make it a little restrictive to solve some of these creative uses. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13393781696-gc-why-the-change-to-starfall.html

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/hunter.jpg Hunter Skills List http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=620 / Talent Calc. 9095 http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter
Deterrence
We built this ability primarily as an Arena tool. It isn't going to help you much in a one-on-one situation. It will buy you time to get a heal or to have an ally deal with the player attacking you. You can also buy a few seconds of life in order to Disengage or the like.

The directional component is something we are trying. It may not fly and we're prepared to change it if it doesn't work out. We wanted the hunter to have to do something other than just pop immunity and run away, but we also realize we ask an awful lot of hunters in general so this just may be too much.

We are much less likely to remove the inability to attack. We've had trouble with defensive abilities being used offensively and don't want to get into situations where the hunter lols at the melee who is up on top of him while he the hunter merrily takes shots at the healer.

One of the biggest reasons we wanted to change the spell in this way, though I understand it may not mean much to some of you, was to get a great visual in there of the hunter just parrying stuff right and left. It can look cool and it can be a visible indicator of what the hunter is doing rather than asking people to pay even more attention to tiny buff icons. It is hard to overestimate how much good art can help an ability feel cool.

Now long term, something we are going to explore a lot more is just plain juicing up hunter melee capabilities. You've got mail and you've even got some melee weapon strikes. If those were actually scary abilities, then a melee or caster class that closes with you risks taking a beating. The hunter could choose to flee or stand and fight. We're not talking about giving hunters a viable melee option like Survival has flirted with a couple of times. But imagine your melee damage was 80% of your ranged damage. Ranged would always be preferable, but melee would be a decent last resort rather than pretty pathetic as it is now. I want to stress that this is a long-term change, not something you'll see in the next patch or two, and I'll be the first to suggest that it may not work out. But it is an idea we're discussing.

Frostfire spec buff

Mental Quickness
Mental Quickness was a talent designed to let a spec without a lot of spellpower Enhancement get a little more. As sometimes happens with talents like this, it looked very attractive to a spec with A LOT of spellpower Elemental as a way to get A LOT more. We had a very similar problem with Holy paladins wanting a Ret talent.

This is one of the reasons why you can't directly compare talents across the board. What is a small buff for one character can be a huge, huge buff to another.

While some amount of venturing into other trees is a good thing, in this case it was basically Elemental abandoning their own tree and able to do more damage playing as an Elemental meaning casting spells with someone else's tree, all because of one talent. This was not because the Elemental tree has bad talents. It was because Mental Quickness was not intended for characters with a lot of spellpower. Unfortunately in this case, we couldn't push the talent deep enough to prevent caster shamans from reaching it. While we do want to juice Elemental's dps, we don't want to do it this way.

Enhancement dps has been competitive overall. There are a lot of AP buffs in the game, so with this change unbuffed shamans will do a little more damage and buffed shamans might do a little less. It's also possible dps could actually go up in the long term depending on just how good Agility is for Enhancement with this change. It might change e.g. how you want to socket your gear.

EDIT: Deep down in this post I announced that we are reverting this change. Mental Quickness will still use AP to convert to spellpower. 

[...] After looking at the numbers some more, we're not convinced we can inflate the Agility bonus to get Enhancement back to where it was before this change without leading to some pretty weird situations where Agility was valued above all else. We also hate losing the synergy with Mental Dexterity's AP boost.

Long story short, after reading your feedback and thinking about it some more, we no longer like this change and are going to revert it.

We will likely swap the positions of Mental Quickness and Static Shock as some of you have suggested.

Bottom line: Mental Quickness will still convert attack power to spell power. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13393781372-why-the-change-to-mental-quickness.html

We are not nerfing Demonology
There are some patch notes that reference nerfs to Demonic Tactics and Demonic Knowledge. We are NOT making those changes. 

There is always a risk when data mining that you pick up something incorrectly. Hunters made dartboards of us well more dartboards anyway when someone thought we had nerfed Wing Clip by misreading a mob ability.

But before you take it out on MMO-Champion or anyone else, these were some actual changes we were experimenting with. Unfortunately, they were part of some other changes that we have decided to not go forward with at this time and when viewed in a vacuum appear to be a nerf to Demonology.

To reiterate though, the changest to Demonic Knowledge and Demonic Tactics are not going to show up on live.

PTRs are a little like betas. We want to try some things out. We plan on updating the data a couple of times if we can.

And yes we have other warlock changes we are working on. Hopefully they will be available on the PTR as well, but no promises. Sometimes changes take time. Believe me, I get impatient too when I know changes to my class are coming. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13393781472-we-are-not-nerfing-demonology.html

Titan's Grip hit penalty removal
Yes, this is accurate. When TG had a decent penalty, it made players approach the talent differently. A 5% penalty is more of an annoyance really. It doesn't offset the huge bonus granted by TG and just seems pointless.

If Fury's dps is too high, we will address it in other ways. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13392251050-hmmmwhy-the-buff-to-titans-grip.html
