Legion - Character Leveling Stats
Today we are taking a look at the percentage of characters of each class that made it from being Level 100 a few months before Legion to Level 110 as of this week.


Some characters were lost to name changes, realm transfers, faction changes, and database issues.
The absolute percentages here have little meaning because of those issues, so they should only be used for comparing one class to another.
Demon Hunters were not included, as the set of characters being checked was from a few months before the pre-expansion patch.
We did the same thing during Mists of Pandaria  and Cataclysm  Keep in mind that both of those were later into the expansion.

One of the cool things about a content-heavy patch cycle is that there is always fun stuff to talk about at Blizzcon Muffinus 

Future Content
At this point in your Legion progression, what sort of content would you most like to see added? Muffinus 
Brawlers guild with new bosses, legion spaceship I can use to explore the universe and planets to conquer with my followers
you sound EXACTLY like Sargeras right now Muffinus 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Seeing the post on reddit in which you basically say that LFR is the worst design decision you've ever made, I'm wondering what was the idea/mindset behind making it? To allow people who aren't that good at the game to experience raiding?
Yeah I expanded a little in that answer. I said that the goal of getting players with less time or willingness to wipe for 3 hours into raiding was a noble goal. Raiding is fun. It's the most epic part of the game IMHO. A lot of storytelling happens in raids and you get to see some great art and interact with famous characters. We definitely spent a lot of dev time on raiding, so getting it accessible to a larger population made sense.

The problem with Raid Finder was that when the content was too tough meaning easier than normal raiding, but not a cake walk then people would tend to drop the raid after a wipe or two. You'd get these revolving doors where the raid itself was stuck on a boss but the individuals in the raid had cycled through maybe 100s of players after a few hours. There was no "Okay, boys and girls, let's call it a night," moment that you get from a raid leader in an organized guild. For that matter, there was no leader who could kick problem players, dictate strategy or explain the fights. For most players, Raid Finder was a weirdly silent and anonymous affair.

The altenative was to make the difficulty level so easy that you'd probably steamroll every boss and that's sort of where we ended up, but it meant you weren't really doing a rotation, lots of people were AFK and these famous bosses hit like kittens.

Daelo Scott Mercer was the other designer who worked with me on Raid Finder, and if I had to do it all over again, I think I would advocate we try something more like a group builder where a leader would invite and be able to kick people. I did a lot of pug raiding over the years, and some of them worked fine, which leads me to believe that model has promise. I *think* WoW has something like that now? Not sure.

I have a lot of faith in those guys. They will eventually figure out a good solution if they haven't already. The original question and answer were both targeting my career as a designer, not an attempt to take a shot at WoW.
