Boubouille2007-09-21, 11:20 PMPatch 2.2.2 should be up on PTRs in the following hours. According to this post, it will likely be released during the first half of october. This also indirectly confirms once again that the 2.2 patch has to be released very soon, next week or the week after

We will be putting up the 2.2.2 PTR realms later this afternoon. The 2.2.2 Patch will contain new holiday content for October, first we intend to test Brewfest and then later Hallows-End, but this may change depending on our testing needs.

There will be pre-mades and character copies for 2.2.2. The character copy process has not started yet but will shortly.
