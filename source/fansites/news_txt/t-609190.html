Update - The splash has been updated with details on the latest rune. <br>
<br>
Official site teaser/splash screen - Day 5<br>
This is the last day before the WWI, the eyes in the middle of the screen really start to look like the Lich King&apos;s ... However the creature artwork has been fully uploaded (we&apos;re not sure if it&apos;s an error or not) and we now have the full picture (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/creatureartwork.jpg) available. <br>

<br>
The splash screen<br>
This is the most obvious part of the teaser, a huge picture of a block of ice slowly cracking to reveal what seems to be a face. Each day a rune was added to the ice.<br>
Day 1 - The first rune looks a lot like the one found on the Lich King swords in many official artworks. <br>
Day 2 - The 2nd rune is the Hel Rune from Diablo 2<br>
Day 3 - The 3rd rune is the Protoss Symbol found on the Starcraft 2 official site (http://www.starcraft2.com/features/)<br>
Day 4 - The 4th rune hasn&apos;t been identified yet, and what looks like the eyes of the lich king appeared in the center of the ice crack. <br>
Day 5 - A new rune has been added and looks like a viking compass. The eyes started to glow, the creature artwork from the CSS files is now complete. The runes also started to glow, you can compare these screenshots : Screenshot #1 (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/splashfinal.jpg) / Screenshot #2 (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/splashfinal2.jpg)<br>

<br>
The &quot;hidden&quot; artwork<br>
If you check the CSS File (http://us.media.blizzard.com/232309/master.css) of the page, you&apos;ll notice a few commented lines pointing to image links. <br>
<br>
/*.tundra {background:url(_images/04.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br>
/*.harbinger {background:url(_images/08.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br>
/*.cold {background:url(_images/16.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br>
/*.cavern {background:url(_images/15.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br>
/*.icy {background:url(_images/23.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br>
/*.evilpenguin {background:url(_images/42.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br>
<br>
There was a few theories about these pictures, people tried to replace the number of each pictures with letter to see if it would form &quot;Diablo&quot; in the end but it didn&apos;t work. Obviously there are many links between &quot;icy&quot;, &quot;tundra&quot;, &quot;cavern&quot;, &quot;cold&quot;, and Wrath of the Lich King / Diablo 2 and we can&apos;t confirm anything based on these names. <br>
<br>
However, now the link with the Numbers from Lost (http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/The_Numbers) is definitely proven.<br>

<br>
Conclusion<br>
Still Diablo 3, and you won&apos;t get any more proof until it&apos;s announced tomorrow.</div></div>
