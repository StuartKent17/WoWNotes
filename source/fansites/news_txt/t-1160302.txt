Beta Patch Size
The next patch for the Mists of Pandaria beta will require a sizable patch – about 16 gigabytes – so please be prepared to utilize those internet tubes. We’re re-organizing data to make things more efficient for future updates, which accounts for this update’s size. Please also be aware you’ll need a good chunk of free hard drive space to handle this particular update.

The good news is that this patch also contains the highly anticipated Pet Battles system!

We really appreciate your continued testing efforts – you’ve been a great help to ensuring we release a great expansion. 


New Pet Battle Site is Live
With the addition of Pet Battles to the World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria beta test, we’ve also launched our all new Pet Battles System website  You can head over there now to read all about the new system, learn how your pets will fight for glory and victory, and look at several screenshots of pets in action.

For all those testing the new system, please join the Pet Battles discussion in our beta feedback forum
