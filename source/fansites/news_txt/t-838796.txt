Boubouille2011-01-25, 06:46 PMUpdate - Obviously, the Alchemy stones are now unique equipped. I assumed people would just check the tooltip but I'd rather make sure it's veeery clear. 
Update - 2200 Rating Weapon Availability 

Update - Archaeology Grey Items Prices
The prices got changed again, Word of Empress Zoe is slightly less ridiculous and most of the prices have been increased again to compensate. I didn't plan to post that so early, expect a better update in a few hours 

Update - Please see This post 


Patch 4.0.6 - PTR Build 13561
A new PTR build will be deployed on test realms, most of these changes are probably already in the official notes but I'm sure there are a couple of new things too. 

Important - For the first time in history, I decided to stop being stupid! Datamined info is now placed in MMO Champion quotes to help differentiate datamining from official information, and it only took me 4 years to do that! Feedback appreciated in comments.
