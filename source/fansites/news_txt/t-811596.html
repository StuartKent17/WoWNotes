Cataclysm Hotfixes - Updated Dec. 13<br>
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm.

We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.<br>

War Games: Battleground and Arena Skirmishes<br>
Beginning with Arena Season 9, we&apos;re giving Arena and Battleground teams the option to challenge each other to War Games, a new kind of skirmish that allows teams to practice, set up matches against friends or rivals, or even try out potential recruits. We&apos;ve prepared a handy FAQ to explain how it works.<br>
<br>
Q: What&apos;s a War Game?<br>
A: A War Game is an unranked match in which one group of players challenges another group to an Arena or Battleground skirmish in a setting of their choosing. You will be able to initiate a War Game by using the /wargame or /wg command, as explained below.<br>
<br>
Q: When will War Games be available?<br>
A: War Games will become available with the start of Arena Season 9. After that point, you&apos;ll be able to play a War Game at any time, regardless of whether a season is underway.<br>
<br>
Q: How does it work?<br>
A: After you&apos;ve formed your group, use the /wargame or /wg command to challenge another group leader to a War Game match, like so:<br>
<br>
/wg groupleadername mapname<br>
<br>
If mapname is left blank, a random Arena or Battleground will be chosen automatically based on the initiating team&apos;s size.<br>
<br>
For example: JohnnyRaider wants to challenge TommyPvP to a 2v2 Arena skirmish in the Nagrand Arena. After each forms a separate group with his respective Arena partner, JohnnyRaider uses the following command to start the War Game:<br>
<br>
/wg tommypvp nagrand arena<br>
<br>
TommyPvP will receive a pop-up notice stating &quot;JohnnyRaider has challenged you to a War Game in the Nagrand Arena.&quot;<br>
<br>
TommyPvP then has a little over a minute to accept the challenge. Once he accepts, each group will be placed in the queue and will receive a pop-up window prompting them to enter the skirmish once it&apos;s ready.<br>
<br>
Q: Can I play War Game skirmishes against members of my own faction?<br>
A: Yes! The War Game skirmish system allows you to challenge players in your same faction to Arena and Battleground matches. You can also challenge those of the opposite faction.<br>
<br>
Q: Do I have to type the whole map name, or can I just type &quot;/wg tommypvp warsong&quot; to enter Warsong Gulch?<br>
A: You can type only part of the Arena or Battleground name, and the system will select the closest match. If you want to be safe, you can use the entire name (as below) to launch a War Game skirmish.<br>
<br>
Arenas: Blade&apos;s Edge Arena, Dalaran Sewers, Nagrand Arena, The Ring of Valor, Ruins of Lordaeron<br>
<br>
Battlegrounds: Alterac Valley, Arathi Basin, The Battle for Gilneas, Eye of the Storm, Isle of Conquest, Strand of the Ancients, Twin Peaks, Warsong Gulch<br>
<br>
Random map options: Random Battleground, All Arenas<br>
<br>
Q: Can I challenge a team from another realm to a skirmish?<br>
A: No, you can only challenge opponents on your own realm.<br>
<br>
Q: Can I start a game if one team has fewer group members than the other?<br>
A: You are able to create a Battleground War Game with uneven team sizes, but you are not able to create an Arena War Game with uneven team sizes. For example, an 8v5 Warsong Gulch War Game is possible, but launching an Arena War Game with uneven team sizes won&apos;t work.<br>
<br>
Q: What&apos;s the largest possible size for a War Game?<br>
A: Arena War Games can support up to 5v5 matches. Battleground group sizes are limited to the maximum number of participants each map normally allows.<br>
<br>
Q: Are any statistics recorded from War Game skirmishes?<br>
A: No, they work similarly to the old Arena skirmish system. Kills, damage, and healing are tracked and displayed at the end of the match, but wins and losses are not.<br>
<br>
Q: How long does it take for a War Game match to start?<br>
A: Once the challenge has been accepted, you will generally be through the queue in less than 30 seconds. War Games offer you a quick way to get into practice matches with other teams, test out potential recruits, or just have fun with your friends.<br>
<br>
Q: Can I receive achievements or guild experience in a War Game?<br>
A: Because you can pick who you play against, nothing is awarded for playing in these skirmishes -- except for the rush that comes with a hard-won victory, of course.<br>
<br>
Q: Do I get honor for killing players in a War Game Battleground?<br>
A: No. These are skirmish matches, so no honor is awarded for objectives or kills.<br>
<br>
Q: What&#x2019;s the difference between the /wg command and the War Game button in the PvP interface?<br>
A: The War Game button is used only for launching Battleground matches. The /wg command covers both Battleground and Arena skirmishes. We plan to further integrate the War Game feature into the PvP interface in a future patch.<br>
<br>
Q: Why have you added this feature?<br>
A: Players have long been asking for a way to challenge specific teams, guildmates, friends, and rivals to skirmish matches in Arenas and Battlegrounds of their choosing. We hope you enjoy this new feature, and we look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!<br>

Cataclysm Shatters Sales Record<br>
IRVINE, Calif. -- December 13, 2010 -- Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. today announced that World of Warcraft&#xAE;: Cataclysm&#x2122;, the third expansion for the critically acclaimed massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), sold through more than 3.3 million copies as of its first 24 hours of release, making it the fastest-selling PC game of all time.* This milestone eclipses the previous record of more than 2.8 million copies sold in 24 hours, set in November 2008 by Blizzard&apos;s second World of Warcraft expansion, Wrath of the Lich King&#xAE;.<br>
<br>
World of Warcraft: Cataclysm was simultaneously released in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Europe, Russia, Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand on December 7, and became available in Korea and the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau on December 9. More than 10,000 stores throughout the world opened their doors at midnight to welcome players who wanted to be among the first to obtain a copy of the expansion. In addition, more than 15,000 players attended official launch events hosted by Blizzard and key retail partners in the US, Canada, France, Germany, Russia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the region of Taiwan.<br>
<br>
&quot;We had to bring Azeroth to the brink of destruction in Cataclysm, but the result was our best expansion yet,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;We want to thank all of our new, existing, and returning players throughout the world for their incredible enthusiasm and support, and we look forward to hearing what they think about all the new content.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;World of Warcraft: Cataclysm delivered even bigger day-one sales than we experienced with StarCraft&#xAE; II: Wings of Liberty&#x2122; in July,&quot; said Bob McKenzie, senior vice president of merchandising at GameStop, &quot;making this a record year for Blizzard Entertainment at GameStop.&quot;<br>
<br>
Prior to the launch of Cataclysm, World of Warcraft&apos;s subscriber population had grown to more than 12 million players globally, further strengthening the game&apos;s position as the world&apos;s most popular subscription-based MMORPG. More information about the new expansion can be found at the official Cataclysm website: http://www.blizzard.com/games/cataclysm/.<br>
<br>
To keep pace with the continued growth of World of Warcraft as well as development on other Blizzard Entertainment&#xAE; games, the company is currently hiring for numerous open positions. More information on career opportunities available at Blizzard Entertainment can be found at www.blizzard.com/jobs.<br>

Dalaran/Shattrath Portals<br>
We have no plans to return the portals to Shattrath and Dalaran. Please refrain from creating further such threads on this topic. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/142903/bring-back-portals-in-shattrah-dalaran))<br>
<br>
Healing in Cataclysm<br>
It&apos;s definitely challenging to heal in Cataclysm and that&apos;s by design. We want players to pick and choose what spells to use and when. Those in your group will also need to be conscious of whether or not they&apos;re putting out enough DPS, taking too much damage, and more. You&apos;ll probably be pulling out more &quot;tricks&quot; from your bag than you&apos;ve been doing in awhile. You&apos;re also going to miss a time or two, run out of mana at a bad time and find yourself trying to figure out just what went wrong. Even experienced healers are going to have to dig their heels in a bit.<br>
<br>
That said, we&apos;re keeping an eye out for how healing is going and should we feel there need to be adjustments, we&apos;ll make them. As many have noticed, we&apos;re starting to get a larger population of level 85 players who will be running through the content and getting better gear to compliment their spells and abilities. That should help some. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/142922/healers-taking-the-brunt-of-the-cataclysm))<br>
