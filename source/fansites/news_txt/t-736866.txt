Cataclysm Beta - Build 12479
A new build of the beta is up. This post will be updated multiple times during the night.

A lot of stuff has changed and we'll need a few mins to fix everything before I can post all the content. Definitely a lot of interesting stuff, stay tuned.


Talent Calculator
WoWTal.com  has been updated with all the new trees. Lot of stuff is still in dev, be careful. If you can't see the new trees push CTRL + F5 to force the refresh Also, I know the level cap is 50, quick hack to fix the max amount of points


 


Classes
Classes pages are up. I might end up doing diffs of all the changes but seriously ... there are really a LOT of changes because of the talent trees revamp, it's probably easier to just check the pages.
