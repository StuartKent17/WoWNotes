Update - Classes pages finally added. Talent calculator finally updated. Worst patch day ever, I need a giant hug. 
Update - Added official talent trees descriptions to the primary skills list.
Update - Ok things are looking better, added the primary skills for all the classes. Some tooltips might be missing/bugged, we're working on it.

Cataclysm Beta - Build 12479
A new build of the beta is up. This post will be updated multiple times during the night.

A lot of stuff has changed and we'll need a few mins to fix everything before I can post all the content. Definitely a lot of interesting stuff, stay tuned.


Talent Calculator
WoWTal.com http://www.wowtal.com/ has been updated with all the new trees. Lot of stuff is still in dev, be careful. If you can't see the new trees push CTRL + F5 to force the refresh Also, I know the level cap is 50, quick hack to fix the max amount of points

Classes
Classes pages are up. I might end up doing diffs of all the changes but seriously ... there are really a LOT of changes because of the talent trees revamp, it's probably easier to just check the pages.
