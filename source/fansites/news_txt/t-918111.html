A new build is being deployed on test realms.<br>
<br>
Update - Murkablo - Preview #2 (Now with Animations)<br>
Murkablo got a couple of animations in this patch, half of them are new and half of them are from the Deathwing mini-pet (because, well, you know, it kinda makes sense for the Murloc/Diablo mini-pet to breath fire)<br>

<br>
Spell Changes<br>
<br>
Cooking<br>
<br>
Cooking: Kibler&apos;s Bits (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/43772/kiblers-bits/#14199/14241) now makes your pet bigger for 5 minutes. <br>

Engineering<br>
<br>

<br>
Mechanics - Mounted<br>
<br>
Tarecgosa&apos;s Visage (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/101641/tarecgosas-visage/#14199/14241) has been added to the &quot;mounted&quot; spells, but not to the actual mounts. Most likely confirms the theory that the &quot;Tarecgosa Mount&quot; datamined is just a transformation during the questline and not an actual mount.<br>
