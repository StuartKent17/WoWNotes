Mike Morhaime Interviews <br>
Mike Morhaime, co-founder and former President of Blizzard Entertainment, recently attended GameLab in Barcelona to accept an award. During interviews with VG247, he was asked about his non-compete contract (https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/26/blizzard-co-founder-mike-morhaime-no-longer-non-compete-coming-back-games/) and about why Heroes of the Storm failed (https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/26/heroes-storm-failed-probably-late-mike-morhaime/).<br>
<br>
<br>
His non-compete ended in April, and he is free to pursue whatever he wants. <br>
He is currently in the brainstorming phase, and doesn&apos;t have anything concrete to share yet.<br>
Some of his ideas are games, some of them are not. <br>
He thinks the Heroes of the Storm team made a great game, but it was a little too late. <br>
One of his biggest regrets was not pursuing Dota early enough. <br>
There were more people playing Dota than Warcraft 3.<br>
Blizzard had their hands&apos; full supporting World of Warcraft.<br>
If he could go back in time he would have had a team start doing something with Dota before the launch of Starcraft 2.</div></div>
