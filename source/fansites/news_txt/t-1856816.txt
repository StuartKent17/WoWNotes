Blue Tweets
Racials
Did they forget to buff Touch of the Grave? Its still doing the same amount of damage it was before the patch.
We'll look into it. CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/638778180967473152

Bugs
what's up with bladestorm? Animation is borked since 6.2.2. Dwarf. Spins once and then stops moving at all until it's complete.
Thanks, I'll pass it on. CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/638784535212261376

PvP
why would you nerf anything when it comes to teams that qualified already on a different state of the game? makes no sens
As stated before, we will do what we feel is right for the game but try to accomodate timing when possible. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/636340716348702721
Good players adapt and overcome to shifts in a game's meta. This is the nature of esports. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/636340824276512768

to change the game a lot after the qualifiers for regionals,all the teams are locked and vulnerable to nerfs
I can't speak for other games. We are only concerned about doing what is best for World of Warcraft. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/636356378626363392
Last year there was a new patch before regional's & I believe they played on the old? #Blizzcon
Incorrect. We stayed on Mists for Blizzcon. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/636564473071857665
you are mistaking Regionals for Blizzcon. 6.0 came out after regionals, before Blizzcon. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/636571169009700865


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Developer Communication
but having something like that even once every few weeks makes a huge difference.
I don't know that I agree. On WoW, it might make the paladins happy but then the shaman wondered when it was "their turn." OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/635965210180718593
I can see that issue. I'd still rather 'somebody' got a turn than nobody. My view may not be consistent with forums overall
If you have say 20 devs engaging it may not be an issue. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/635967340035764224
And I have been at two of the largest studios out there, which couldn't produce 20. But I can dream! OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/635967603236671488
