Did they forget to buff Touch of the Grave? Its still doing the same amount of damage it was before the patch.
We'll look into it. CM_Lore 

Bugs
what's up with bladestorm? Animation is borked since 6.2.2. Dwarf. Spins once and then stops moving at all until it's complete.
Thanks, I'll pass it on. CM_Lore 

PvP
why would you nerf anything when it comes to teams that qualified already on a different state of the game? makes no sens
As stated before, we will do what we feel is right for the game but try to accomodate timing when possible. holinka 
Good players adapt and overcome to shifts in a game's meta. This is the nature of esports. holinka 

to change the game a lot after the qualifiers for regionals,all the teams are locked and vulnerable to nerfs
I can't speak for other games. We are only concerned about doing what is best for World of Warcraft. holinka 
Last year there was a new patch before regional's & I believe they played on the old? #Blizzcon
Incorrect. We stayed on Mists for Blizzcon. holinka 
you are mistaking Regionals for Blizzcon. 6.0 came out after regionals, before Blizzcon. holinka 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Developer Communication
but having something like that even once every few weeks makes a huge difference.
I don't know that I agree. On WoW, it might make the paladins happy but then the shaman wondered when it was "their turn." OccupyGStreet 
I can see that issue. I'd still rather 'somebody' got a turn than nobody. My view may not be consistent with forums overall
If you have say 20 devs engaging it may not be an issue. OccupyGStreet 
And I have been at two of the largest studios out there, which couldn't produce 20. But I can dream! OccupyGStreet 


Poll - Flying Achievement
Now that flying is here, it is time to see how many of you are ready to fly! We last looked at this  a few weeks ago and it was a pretty even split.

Stats on the overall number of players that have earned the achievement are coming within the next week or so.
