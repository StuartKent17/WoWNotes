Patch 5.4 - Timeless Isle Chests
Last week , we talked about the new BoA ilvl 496 tokens on the Timeless Isle and the ability to upgrade them to 535s with a Burden of Eternity  Today, we look at the biggest source of these items on the Timeless Isle: chests. 

While the Timeless Isle hosts many different rare mobs and events, by far the fastest way for a character new to the Timeless Isle to get epics is through finding these chests. The catch is that almost all of the chests can only be found and looted once per character and you have to compete with other players for respawns though they're short.

There are several major types of chests on the island, so here is a list which also serves as a legend for the map below. Keep in mind that contents and locations can change before these go live. 


Tier 1 1: These are on the western half of the Timeless Isle and have the name "Moss-Covered Chest". They contain a very small amount of Timeless Coins and can sometimes contain an epic token.
Tier 2 2: These are on the eastern half of the Timeless Isle and have the name "Moss-Covered Chest". They contain a few hundred Timeless Coins and can sometimes contain an epic token.
Tier 3 3: These chests are located in hard to reach places and have many different names. The western two of them are on top of cliffs and are accessible by using a Highwind Albatross  Another two are in caves, and the final one is an area densely populated by Gulp Frog  These chests all contain a few hundred Timeless Coins and multiple epic tokens.
Tier 4 4: These chests are located in the middle of groups of Ordos yaungol and have the name "Smouldering Chest". They contain several hundred Timeless Coins and multiple epic tokens.
Tier 5 5: This 'ultimate' chest, the Blazing Chest , is located in the western part of the Ordos Sanctuary and can be tricky to reach due to the large amount of high-level elites in the area. The chest contains a medium amount of Timeless Coins, a few epic tokens, and a guaranteed Burden of Eternity 
Daily D: As the name implies, these chests can be looted once per day, unlike the majority of the island's chests. All of them are in places that require effort and even some platforming skills to reach. Additionally, they all drop Lesser Charms of Good Fortune in addition to a medium amount of Timeless Coins and a possible epic token.
Weekly W: As the name implies, these chests can be looted once per week, unlike the majority of the island's chests. Both of these chests are underwater and require a bit of fighting to reach - one even requires a key from the mobs around it. Additionally, they both drop ~5-15Lesser Charms of Good Fortune in addition to a medium amount of Timeless Coins and a possible epic token. The southern-most Weekly chest also will contain a Cursed Swabby Helmet  the first time you open it.



  

In addition to lots of loot, these chests are now linked to achievements as well. Finding all of the 'one-time' chests Tier 1-5 in the list above will net you the achievement Treasure, Treasure Everywhere  If you loot both Weekly chests and the eastern-most Daily chest all three are pirate-themed, you will receive the achievement Where There's Pirates, There's Booty , and you can receive the achievement Extreme Treasure Hunter  for getting the other three Daily chests.

Patch 5.4 - No Epic Gems
It seems we won't get epic gems during Patch 5.4.


  


Raid Testing Schedule - August 6
On Tuesday, August 6, we will continue testing raid encounters in the Siege of Orgrimmar raid. We're moving on to 10-player Heroic testing at this time, and then 25-player mode as the PTR cycle progresses.

Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below for all Public Test Realms.

Tuesday, August 6
Thok the Bloodthirsty - 10 Player Heroic - 10:30 PDT 13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST
Iron Juggernaut - 10 Player Heroic - 16:00 PDT 19:00 EDT, 01:00 CEST

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.

Hunter Spec Identity
Long-term ie: not for 5.4, we will be making some bigger changes to the Hunter class. It may not be a full class revamp like the Warlock revamp in 5.0, but we do want to give the class a full once-over and make sure that the specs feel different and unique. We are not planning any further, class-wide mechanical changes for 5.4.

We have not yet balanced DPS for Hunters or anyone for 5.4. When we do, we'll make sure that as much of that balancing as possible is done via signature shots.

Before you get excited, note the wording "as much of that balancing as possible."
By that, I meant that signature shots are going to be the primary target for any buffs to bring Hunter damage up, but there's only so much we could buff them depending on how much actually needs to be done. We wouldn't, say, allow Explosive Shot to tick for 500k just to bring Survival PvE DPS up. Instead, we'd bring up Explosive Shot as much as we comfortably could, and then make minor tweaks elsewhere if further balancing was necessary.

Marksmanship has been a spec without a niche this entire expansion which is why it hasn't been played.
Apologies for picking out one part of your post, but I think this illustrates pretty well the exact issue we'd like to fix post-5.4. We'd like to make sure that all three specs have a bit more "identity."

Also still trying to figure out which RPGS hold RNG as a time honored tradition. Especially as far as player prog is concerned
Any game with a crit chance or a range on damage e.g. 7-13 inserts RNG into determining the outcome of a fight. Source 

Not blaming you personally but why does there seem a lame excuse every Q call when Sub losses are announced.
I think the intent is to provide context, not an excuse. Source 

I just wonna say, that we're sick of this argument due to double standarts.
Okay. That doesn't make it go away. There are only 8-10 working hours in a day. Source 
We appreciate feedback on features you like, but we don't want to leave it to the community to decide how we spend our time. Source 
The community would never agree anyway. Source 
Don't use "we have no time" argument then, tell the truth - "we don't want to do it".
We say we don't want to do something when that is so. Other times we are just stacking high vs. low priorities. Source 
We usually do get around to the low priorities eventually. Source 


Patch 5.4 - Vengeance Diminishing Returns
Keep in mind that this is a translated post, so details can be lost. Thanks to ngacnlcq for the translation  
Brief summary: You will get 1/N of the full Vengeance when hit by the mob within 5 seconds who has the Nth highest DPS. This "N" will be recalculated each time you are hit.

For example, you are tanking 3 mobs: one is the Boss and the other two are mobs. The Boss has 1.5 million DPS, one mob has 400K and the other has 300K. The system will now sort these mobs by their DPS: 

1. Boss: 1.5 million DPS, so you will get 1/1 100% of the full Vengeance.
2. The first mob: 400K DPS, so you will get 1/2 50% of the full Vengeance.
3. The second mob: 300K DPS, so you will get 1/3 33.33% of the full Vengeance.

This mechanism will be recalculated when you are hit by even more mobs within 5 seconds1/4, 1/5, 1/6,etc. Additionally, in the example above, if the first mob is not attacking you while the second mob is, you will get 1/2 of the full Vengeance by this attack instead of 1/3.


WoWDB Addon Data Collection
Collection data on things like Timeless Isle drops and locations is done with the help of many players. The more people that contribute data, the more accurate and quickly we can update the database. 

To help out, just click here curse://enable-wowdb-upload if you have Curse Client already installed. 

When you are playing the addon will gather data and save it. When you are done playing, Curse Client will see the game close and upload the collected data from the addon. You can see the last time data was uploaded by looking in the Plugins tab of the options, as well as making sure the addon is enabled there. Be sure you have Curse Client open before you close WoW so that the data will upload!
