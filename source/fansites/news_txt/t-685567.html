It&apos;s Christmas eve and I have a wonderful story for you! Neverdied (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-statistics.xml?r=Durotan&amp;cn=Neverdied&amp;gn=Chimera), a mage from Chimera (http://www.worldofchimera.com/) (US - Durotan) reached level 80 yesterday!<br>

<br>
Of course it&apos;s not just another level 80, the character was leveled without any quests, instances, or even deaths! Here is the mail I received: <br>

Back in may I saw http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17367601961 (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17367601961) and http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17779679689 (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17779679689) and thought it would be fun to combine them.<br>
<br>
First try I died to being over confident, second try I died to 3 casters respawns on top of me while in higher levels, last try was death due to server lag.<br>
<br>
At first I was only going to do no deaths and no achievements but as I was grinding I thought I could do this without quests. On the second try I thought I could avoid flight paths all together. Then on the third try I had made a list of all the restrictions I thought I could go through.<br>
<br>
They had to be:<br>
<br>
No death<br>
No questing<br>
No instances, BGs or Arenas<br>
No mounts or flight paths<br>
No professions<br>
No loot<br>
Just grinding.<br>
<br>
Contrary to what people think this took a lot of practice and planning. I had to be careful what parts of maps to discover, what mobs to grind and be aware of places I could fall from. Cautious the warrior died from falling so a mage would help. Also I needed to travel a lot so portals would help a ton moving around. Actually the ports where the main reason I picked a mage and also for invisibility at higher levels which saved my arse many times.<br>
<br>
Finally since this was a pve server I didn t need more escape mechanism than what mages had. Played was about 10 days and 12 hours but that also involves many hours on the AH scanning and looking for gear so it is not that accurate. I did use RAF on the first try but it wasn t efficient to dual box and I abandoned the idea on the second try because it would have been not worthy.<br>
<br>
It was full solo 31900 mobs grinded in about 4 months. Some 6 hours sessions, some only rested XP. Basically a little everyday. Next is finishing the same thing on a pvp server...but on a different name and a different class and no you can not know what server :)<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;<br>
<br>
Congratulations to him for such an impressive achievement, that&apos;s definitely a lot of time and dedication! <br>

Winter&apos;s Veil Achievement and Quest Concerns<br>
Posted by Syndri on the Customer Service forum: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=22048397469&amp;sid=1<br>

<br>
We&#x2019;re aware that many players have experienced difficulty completing the achievement &#x201C;&#x2019;Tis the Season&#x201D; and the quest &#x201C;Metzen the Reindeer.&#x201D; While the Game Master department will not be in a position to grant credit for this achievement or quest, here are a few tips to help you complete them on your own.<br>
<br>
&#x2018;Tis The Season<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ve received many reports of players not receiving the &#x201C;Tis&#x2019; the Season&#x201D; achievement despite meeting the listed requirements (eating Graccu&#x2019;s Mince Meat Fruitcake with 3 pieces of Winter Clothing equipped), and this is most often related to &#x201C;broken&#x201D; Winter Clothing.<br>
<br>
To ensure that you are able to receive this achievement, please check the durability of your Winter Clothing and repair any broken pieces prior to eating Graccu&#x2019;s Mince Meat Fruitcake. If any pieces of equipped Winter Clothing are broken at the time that Graccu&#x2019;s Mince Meat Fruitcake is eaten, you will not be eligible for the &#x201C;&#x2019;Tis the Season&#x201D; achievement.<br>
<br>
Metzen the Reindeer<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ve also received a number of reports that Smokywood Satchels do not always include a Pouch of Reindeer Dust if received while in a raid group. Unfortunately, without the Pouch of Reindeer Dust, the quest &#x201C;Metzen the Reindeer&#x201D; cannot be completed.<br>
<br>
To guarantee that your Smokywood Satchel contains both Metzen&#x2019;s Letters and Notes and the Pouch of Reindeer dust, please make sure that you are not in a raid group when you accept this quest. If you have this quest in your log currently but are unable to complete it due to the missing quest item, please abandon the quest and accept it again while not in a raid group. <br>
