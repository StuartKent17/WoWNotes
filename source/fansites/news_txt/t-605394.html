I guess I was right this morning, 4 new Season 4 items have been activated on PTRs, including the first weapon : [Brutal Gladiator&apos;s Greatsword] (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/brutalgladiatorgreatsword.jpg). Non-set items in Season 4 have the &quot;Guardian&apos;s ...&quot; prefix. <br>

Another week of 2.4 testing is starting ! Obviously the amount of new items/quests is much lower now that most of the content is known, however keep in mind that the Season 4 items are included in this patch and 99% of them are still unknown (see this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=4573.0) for the few items already discovered on PTRs), it wouldn&apos;t be surprising if Blizzard decided to activate them on PTRs at some point just to balance a few things. This post might be updated in a few hours depending on how fast I can work with Photoshop ^^<br>
<br>
of the Shattered Sun ...<br>
Ever wondered what&apos;s the point of leveling your Shattered Sun Offensive reputation to exalted if you don&apos;t need the epic jewelcrafting patterns (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/) or the shiny Tabard ? I never took the time to talk about it, but there is actually a nice reward for people reaching Exalted with the Shattered Sun Offensive : a new title ! The only thing you&apos;ll need to complete this quest (beside being Exalted) is a &quot;small&quot; fee of 1000 gold, that&apos;s the price to pay to be &quot;............ of the Shattered Sun&quot; !

Hawkstrider/Elekk PvP mounts are back !<br>
Blizzard is trying once again to include Hawkstriders and Elekks as PvP mounts rewards in the game, both mounts are now available from PvP vendors (#1 (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/elekkshop.jpg), #2 (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/swiftwarshop.jpg)) on PTRs and even if they&apos;re still bugged (wrong color or icons), the [item=34129] and the [item=35906] are definitely here.<br>

Enchant Cloak - Steelweave<br>
A few days ago I posted a screenshot for a new cloak enchantment : Enchant Cloak - Steelweave (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/enchantsteelweave.jpg). Good news, we also know where [item=35756] drops now ! It looks like it drops from bosses in Heroic Magister&apos;s Terrace (Delrissa confirmed, but you can probably get it from any of the boss here).<br>

Arenas - Mind vision disabled in 2.4<br>
I don&apos;t think this was reported in the patch notes, you will not be able to use Mind Vision in arenas after the release of patch 2.4. This was disabled because currently, casting Mind Vision on a player that&apos;s drinking causes the player drinking to stand up and cancel their drinking.<br>
Q: Currently, casting Mind Vision on a player that&apos;s drinking causes the player drinking to stand up and cancel their drinking. This plays a huge problem in conjunction with the drinking change. Priests will be able to prevent a player from drinking the entire area due to Mind Vision requiring no LoS and infinite range.<br>
<br>
A: Mind Vision will not currently work in Arenas with patch 2.4.0. We are working on a technical fix for this in the meantime.<br>

Midsummer feedback on PTRs<br>
Kisirani (who is part of the team creating all the Holiday events in WoW) posted a few words about the Midsummer festival testing going on PTRs.<br>
First, if you&apos;ve noticed, you can now purchase most of the old, discontinued quest rewards for blossoms. We&apos;ve also hooked it up so that characters who had the quest &quot;A Light in Dark Places&quot; (completed, mind you) in their quest log that were waiting to turn it in can do so. I don&apos;t believe we&apos;ll be removing the XP from the quests. If anything, many of the buffs and the like from this event further support the gaining of experience. If you wish to remain static at one level, that is your choice, but it is not a choice we necessarily support, and as a result you may miss out on rewards from quests.<br>
<br>
And just because we&apos;re testing midsummer content, it doesn&apos;t mean the patch is releasing in the summer. Event content like this is always patched in early and then lies latent until the time is right.<br>
<br>
As a reminder, the biggest addition to the Midsummer festival is probably Lord Ahune.<br>
<br>
Lord Ahune<br>
Lord Ahune (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/lordahune2.jpg) is a new Headless-horseman-like boss, you will be able to fight him during the Midsummer Festival (June 21 - July 5) and after a small fight he might reward you with a few epics. That&apos;s a daily quest and you&apos;ll be able to summon him once a day.<br>
<br>
Phase 1 - The boss spawns two types of adds and you can&apos;t really damage him, just take care of the adds and after a minute, Ahune will go into phase 2.<br>
Phase 2 - Ahune submerges (ragnaros-style) and its Frozen Core will spawn, that&apos;s when you attack him. After some time Ahune will emerge and you&apos;ll have to fight adds for one more minute before he submerges again, etc ...<br>
