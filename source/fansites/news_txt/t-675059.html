Due to issues with the instance servers crashing, we&apos;re going to reschedule the Icecrown Gunship Battle encounter for a future time.<br>
<br>
[Spoiler] Icecrown Citadel - Frostmourne Area<br>
I guess it didn&apos;t take long before smart people figured out there was an opening here and it only took a few hours to some people to figure out where the Frostmourne room was. Anyway, below is a small video and screenshot preview of the room added in the latest PTR patch and called &quot;Frostmourne&quot;<br>
<br>
+DUNGEON_FLOOR_ICECROWNCITADEL7 = &quot;The Frozen Throne&quot;;<br>
+DUNGEON_FLOOR_ICECROWNCITADEL8 = &quot;Frostmourne&quot;;<br>
<br>
Blizzard warned you about spoilers, I warned you about spoilers, I guess I can&apos;t do much more than that. You can also stop sending me hatemails because &quot;OH GOD YOU WILL NEVER POST ANYTHING AGAIN&quot;. <br>
<br>
Note : This is NOT the Frozen Throne, this is a completely different subzone of the instance. <br>
