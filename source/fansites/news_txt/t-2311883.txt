Constructed deep within the core of Argus and outfitted with an arsenal capable of decimating worlds, this war machine has been designed for a single purpose: to bring the mortals' invasion to its knees.


Overview - The fel reaver's cannons continously alternate between Annihilation  and Decimation  Upon reaching 65% and 25% health, the fel reaver activates its Apocalypse Drive  exposing its weapon platforms. Unless one of these weapons is destroyed before the cast can complete, the party will be eradicated. On Mythic difficulty, the cannons can no longer be destroyed, but instead go haywire, granting the cannons additional effects.

Game Developer Tweets
What is the biggest challenge in implementing new features in a game like World of Warcraft?
I mean, the biggest challenge is making sure the feature is fun. It’s pretty easy in a rewards-based game to manipulate players into engaging in something that isn’t actually fun for them, so just looking at players using the feature can give you a false read.

For any big game like WoW, the challenges of adding new features are along these lines:


Is this the best use of our dev resources compared to something else we could be doing?
Is the eventual upkeep of this feature bugs, bit rot, expectations of additional content, player support when someone opens a ticket, etc. going to be worth it?
Does the complexity of the game get too great with these feature layered on top of all of our other feature? I’ll point out WoW professions as one of those systems that constantly gets knocked around by other systems, sometimes unintentionally. For example, if quest rewards are too generous, there is less need for profession equipment. If there are more efficient ways to make gold, there is less need for gold from trade skills.
Does the complexity of the game get so great that players don’t have the mental bandwidth to deal with it all?
Does this feature compete with some other feature? Are players going to chose X over Y or Y over X instead of them living compatibly?
Are players going to use the feature in the ways you expect? Strictly speaking, it’s fun and often exciting if players use the feature in a way you didn’t anticipate, but you should make sure they are still having fun and you aren’t undermining other parts of the game.
What is the player need you are trying to meet with the feature? Will your feature really meet those goals? Is there a better way? Is there some feature already in the game that will do a better job?
