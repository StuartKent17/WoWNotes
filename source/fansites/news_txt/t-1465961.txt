Warlords of Draenor Developer Interviews
There were a few developer interviews at the recent press events, so today we are taking a look at interviews with Ion Hazzikostas from Eurogamer  and Brian Holinka from PlayersCut 

Eurogamer

The Level 90 boost is being sold to allow players that would have purchased multiple copies of WoW to get more Level 90 characters to do so in a more reasonable way.
The price point was decided upon to avoid devaluing the accomplishment of leveling a character to 90.
If Blizzard's goal was to sell as many boosts as possible, they would have set the price lower. 
The price point wasn't selected to maximize profit, just to represent the amount of time that it takes to level to 90. 


PlayersCut

The team has already started planning for the next two expansions. 
Removing arena teams was an important part of increasing participation in arenas. 
There is a lot of Garrison content that comes from having followers. 
Patch 6.0 isn't the end of new content for Garrisons, as more content can be added as the expansion progresses. 
The devs know that some kind of Garrison PvP sounds really cool, but there aren't any solid plans yet.
Ashran has a lot of players taking part in the battle, but they are spread out so that performance doesn't suffer. Ashran has a fortress for each faction, as well as capture points spread around the outside of the zone that are beneficial to hold. There will likely be a larger central battle with other battles going on around the outer part of the zone. 
There aren't any plans for mobile content for WoW right now.
The technology for character model animation was finally at a point where models could updated for this expansion. Character models had also started to look outdated compared to some of the newer art assets in the game. The Pandaren were the test for new character models, and using lessons learned from them the team can update all of the other races. 
There are so many older armor models that it isn't possible to go back and update them all. The team can use them as inspiration for new armor sets though. 



PvP Season 15 Begins
Season 15 gear  uses the same models as Season 14 , but with different colors available to each faction. 
With weapons at the ready and armor secured, it’s time to kick off PvP Season 15! The playing field is even once more, and this is your chance to prove that true grit and steely determination are what it takes to become a champion. So grab your most trusted companions and teach your enemies the true definition of fear!

Before you set foot in an Arena or on a Battleground, keep in mind we’ve made a few changes this season:


Conquest gear is now Item Level 550
The Dampening debuff will be applied in 2v2 matches 5 minutes after the start of an Arena match, and games will reach a draw at 20 minutes. Dampening decreases the effectiveness of healing spells by 1% every 10 seconds.
Base Resilience is now 77% up from 72%.
Battle Fatigue is now 65% up from 55%.


Good luck, champions—may the most bloodthirsty warriors win!


Season 14 Titles
These titles and achievements were indeed given out erroneously, and we're in the process of applying some fixes that will remove them from characters below level 90.

One additional clarification, since we've seen this question come up elsewhere: These titles went out completely separately from the ladder, and thus did not affect the number of titles given to max-level players in any way. No one is missing titles due to this error.


Blue Tweets
Classes
I'd like to point out Life Tap, which changes to a passive and maintains its bar position for destruction. I like that.
Seems like there has been much confusion about this tweet. It refers to how 3 active talents share 1 button without macros. Celestalon 
What if it's a tier where one of the talents is passive? It will be an empty slot then?
Then we likely would not make the other two share a button like that. Celestalon 
Couldn't talents be adjusted so that they can be made into one skill slot. Tiger's Lust is the only ability 1/2
No, we don't want to constrict our design space to 'only new buttons' or 'no new buttons' for a row. Mixtures are great sometimes Celestalon 
So stuff like the warrior tier with Bladestorm etc
Yes; we could make Shockwave, Dragon Roar, and Bladestorm all share a button, so you don't have to swap after retalenting. Celestalon 
Would it be Macro-able? Like "/cast Tier3Talent" or something?
Something like that. Mages already can do /cast Mage Bomb. Celestalon 

Cool or Uncool: Instead of separate spells, procs like Pyro/MC change upgrade Fireball/Shadowbolt. #ButtonBloatProbz
We think we could do a lot more spell replacement. holinka 

Personally, maintaining %dmg buffs is not interesting gameplay. There's a reason ISF got cut from Destro.
It depends on *how* you maintain it. If it just happens, it's just rampup. If your rotation molds around it, it can be cool/fun. Celestalon 
could we rebalance lavalash to not require flame imbue? it doesnt feel like weapon imbues are optional at all
Weapon imbues are not intended to be optional. Celestalon 
Not saying imbues should necces be passive, but if they are active they need to provide meaningful gameplay.
When you get to the point of complaining about the maintenance upkeep of a 1hr buff, that persists through death... Celestalon 

What are your thoughts on passive immunities like dematerialize & subterfuge, Holinka? Are they staying for WoD?
Not committed to either staying. holinka 

Art
Will the new char. models change Tauren male dual weilding's graphic to stop the left hand weapon from slanting to the left?
Yes; the latest in-progress version has the weapon turned around completely and clipping into your crotch. I'd hope so. Dave_Maldo 

Character / Items
Why is there a need for catch up loot? Why are we encouraged to skip old tiers of content in every expac?
Many reasons. A big one is so that the playerbase is centralized; easier for guild recruiting, playing with friends, etc. Celestalon 

Warlords of Draenor Stats
passive != fun! is math not fun? is altering your fantasy incarnation via the universal language useful? 
We're not making stats more/less passive. Math is fun. I don't understand what your issue is. I suspect a misunderstanding. Celestalon 
excuse my bad jokes. just that balancing stats, building different gear sets for different situations, etc, was a lot of fun. ->
And still will be. We're not getting rid of that, at all. Celestalon 

Obv, I'm talking about Active Mitigation scaling. If Multistrike provides only dps/threat, it will be a garbage stat for tanks.
All secondary stats will be of defensive value for tanks. Some may be passive mitigation, some may be active mitigation. Celestalon 

PvP
Can you please clarify the requirements for Hero of the Horde/Alliance? 
let's say there's 1000 ppl above 1000, then top 5 get hero. If #5 doesn't have 50 games, then #6 gets hero. holinka 

Have you guys considered random starting locations and horde v horde, af v af in random bgs? maybe not all
many players find the faction swap in RBGs quite jarring. Not something we want to expand on. holinka 

I dont think you ever commented on what you think the prob is in AV/IOC. Thoughts?
IoC I blame mostly on a bug in 5.3 where Alliance could leave gates early and win most games. holinka 
This damaged the hivemind view of Horde win chance in the bg and so sophisticated horde avoid it. holinka 
AV has map problems, but Horde also avoid it, making the situation even worse. holinka 
Some might think map design is only problem but even on mirrored maps, one faction fares better. holinka 
Much obliged; very relieved to hear the AV map is suspect. I've said this for awhile. Thanks!
Woah, easy there. I said it has problems, but I'm not sure they are HUGE problems. holinka 
Not to be rude but if you know AV has problems, why has nothing been done in 8+ years?
AV has gone through a lot of change in 8 years holinka 

Final win to loss ratio 4 ally in ioc: 100 wins, 2 losses. How do devs look at those stats and call them fair-balanced? 
We've been pretty clear on saying there's a problem but it's more complicated to fix than some players think. holinka

Illidan  is just one of the WoW characters that appear in Heroes of the Storm! He also comes with a normal skin that we looked at recently
