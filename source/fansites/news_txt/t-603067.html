All you need is to ask nicely, in a lot of forum posts. <br>
After further discussion about the change in patch 2.3 which adds diminishing returns to silencing effects, we&apos;ve decided to revert the change. Though we do feel that being chain school locked is a problem and plan to address it at some point in the future, we weren&apos;t comfortable with the amount of testing this particular change received.<br>
<br>
2.3 Not for this week<br>
The first post of our great &quot;Will the 2.3 patch be released this week ?&quot; series ! Sorry, no.<br>
2.3 released this week ?<br>
# [ ] True<br>
# [X] False<br>
<br>
I declare your proof as completely false... because it isn&apos;t tomorrow. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2766150565&amp;postId=27656924478&amp;sid=1#14))<br>

2vs2 isn&apos;t balanced<br>
Honestly, 2v2 has a ways to go before I&apos;d be truly satisfied with its balance. In fact, at one point during the Burning Crusade beta we considered removing the format in favor of 4v4, but have decided to stick with it since so many players enjoy only needing to find 1 teammate to be able to participate in arenas.<br>
<br>
However, 2v2 balance goes beyond just a warlock/druid vs warrior/druid issue, there are a lot of classes out there that are left out of having a reasonable chance at the very high end because of the endurance nature of the format, and drain tanking felt to the class team as a meaningful part of the problem.<br>
<br>
Champion of the Naaru<br>
Players can still work towards this title even after patch 2.3 is released. It&apos;s very likely, however, that we&apos;ll be hard capping the title so that it cannot be obtained once you&apos;re higher than level 70.<br>

March of the Legion : New TCG loot confirmed<br>
I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s because of what we posted yesterday (doubtful, it wasn&apos;t that much of a secret), UDE released a preview of the new loot cards on their site (http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/wow/en/news/article.aspx?aid=3415). The paper airplane is the most common loot, then the rocket chicken and the dragon kite. (Thanks to TS (http://www.ctmod.net) for the info)<br>

<br>
Paper Airplane (1/3)<br>
The most common Loot item from March of the Legion will be a paper airplane manual! After getting the book from good ol&#x2019; Landro, you&#x2019;ll be able to use it and get one of two types of paper airplanes: a small zeppelin or a flying machine that looks like something a gnome might whip up! Each use of the item will produce one of the two airplane models (it&#x2019;s a 50% rate for both items). With the paper airplane in your bag, you can use that item and throw it at somebody. Once it reaches them, they can throw it back to you or anybody else they see. The best part about these airplanes is that you can make multiples, leave them in your inventory, and then BAM, you can unleash a swarm of paper on an unsuspecting target!<br>
<br>
Robot Chicken (2/3)<br>
The cosmetic pet you get from turning in the Robotic Homing Chicken code will get you Landro&#x2019;s newest addition to his exotic menagerie. Aside from making all the night elf chicks dig your character, the robotic homing chicken will occasionally do one of two things. Both involve his rockets taking him into the air. One of them involves him landing safely again, the other results in the rockets exploding and sending him to that big twelve-piece bucket in the sky.<br>
<br>
Dragon Kite (3/3)<br>
Don&#x2019;t worry, it won&#x2019;t periodically light you on fire or send a horde of whelps at you. Wait till you see players&#x2019; reactions the first time you run through Shattrath with Onyxia behind you! Feeling a little cocky on your PvP server? Take Onyxia along to announce your upcoming ganking spree and watch the lowbies run. For those of you who like to make a grand entrance, this is the Loot item you&#x2019;ve been waiting for! Also, don&#x2019;t forget how electricity was discovered; if you fly the kite around long enough, you might see a cloud form and strike it.</div></div>
