Artcraft - Level Design Part 1<br>
Hi, I&#x2019;m Chris Robinson, senior art director of World of Warcraft, and welcome to a special edition of Artcraft focused on environment and zone design. Previously we showed you what it was like to create the Spires of Arak (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/13987918/artcraft-the-spires-of-arak-5-6-2014) from a purely art-focused perspective, but over the coming days we&#x2019;ll be releasing a series of articles focused on exterior level design, using Nagrand as a focal point. You&#x2019;ll be hearing from the team who works with the artists, as well as the quest designers, systems designers, historians, and more to craft and create not only the zones we adventure in, but the visual story that is told about these locations and the creatures and races that inhabit them. For this first article, I&#x2019;m pleased to introduce Julian Morris, our lead level designer.<br>
<br>
Hey everyone, Julian Morris here, lead level designer for the World of Warcraft exterior level design team.<br>
<br>
Exterior level design is the process of designing and constructing the zones of World of Warcraft, from Azeroth to Draenor and everything in between. Our team has planned, plotted, and designed the rise and fall of ancient cultures, as well as shaped mountains, forests, seas, lakes, rivers, roads, ruins, and every land feature imaginable. In addition to the land itself, we also design and create cities, towns, and Battlegrounds (with the random exterior dungeon or two in there every now and then, too).<br>

<br>
The level design team is a hybrid of both art and design. We work hand in hand with the quest design team to build the environmental stories that support the content that defines Azeroth&#x2019;s lands, cultures, and conflicts.<br>
<br>
We also work every step of the way with all of the art groups on the Warcraft team. Working with the environment art team, we sculpt and paint the landscapes to create the rich, vibrant settings that form the foundation of the world. Within those spaces we work with the dungeon team, designing and constructing the thousands of camps, towns, settlements, and cities that provide the unique architectural beauty that anchors all of our cultures and creatures to the world. These locations in turn provide the scenes and staging for the finely crafted set dressing&#x2014;the tables, chairs, books, and more&#x2014;that our prop art team creates.<br>

<br>
Level design binds the vision of many groups together, and it takes the passionate effort of all these teams to create an incredibly detailed, hand-crafted experience.<br>
<br>
The zones of World of Warcraft are their own main characters that come to life before our very eyes during development. In this series, we&#x2019;re going to draw back the curtains a bit to show you more on how we approach world-building and how we breathe life into a zone.<br>
