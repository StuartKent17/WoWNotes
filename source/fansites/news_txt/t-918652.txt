World IPv6 Day
Wednesday, June 8, is World IPv6 Day, a day when companies and individuals around the world will be working to test their IPv6 support. Blizzard is getting involved, and so can you!

Beginning on June 8, players on the below realms will be able to connect to the game using IPv6. This isn’t a straightforward task and – while not extremely difficult – does involve research to ensure each component of your internet connection supports IPv6, as well as editing a game file with a text editor. While we’d love to have everyone participate, we don’t recommend taking part unless you’re already comfortable with technical aspects of your computer hardware, software, and World of Warcraft. If you aren’t comfortable tackling the task, or run into a snag while trying, don’t worry, we’ll get plenty of testing and you have our thanks for just making yourself more aware of IPv6.

If you’d like to know how to get started, or would like more information on what it’s all about, check out our IPv6 page:  and FAQ: 

The realms that will support IPv6 on June 8 are:

Antonidas, Anub'arak, Blackwater Raiders, Bladefist, Borean Tundra, Cairne, Cenarion Circle, Cenarius, Darrowmere, Drak'Tharon, Drenden, Echo Isles, Farstriders, Fenris, Garrosh, Hydraxis, Hyjal, Korialstrasz, Lightbringer, Maiev, Misha, Mok'Nathal, Moon Guard, Nazgrel, Nesingwary, Nodrassil, Quel'dorei, Ravenholdt, Rivendare, Shandris, Shu'halo, Sisters of Elune, The Forgotten Coast, Tortheldrin, Uther, Vashj, Winterhoof, Wyrmrest Accord 


The Daily Blink - Plumbing as a Primary Profession
I like The Daily Blink 's approach of the potentially upcoming 64-bit client. I also like how they thought that mentioning me would get them mentioned on the front page! ... Oh. Crap.
