Blue Tweets
PvE
Ulduar-style teleporters would be very useful in raids with optional bosses.
Yeah, the system in Highmaul definitely breaks down if you do Ko'ragh then want to double back and work on a boss you missed. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/554325456929845248

Could you please force loot system to be personal only in the first 2 weeks of heroic raids, to discourage the alt whoring? Ppl should play alts beacuse they like to play alts or try a different class, not because the mains gearing benefit is so huge. I feel like the whole effort I put during the first weeks of WoD garrison, CMs, apexis is eclipsed by the powerful HC loot. You can't get loot you already have in the first week since it's the first time everyone does that content, so no item is wasted. It can happen in the 2nd week when mythic is released, but it's still a much better compromise. And since your goal is to have stats as close as possible across the specs, there shouldn't be much whining about it either. I'm in a 3day raiding guild, top 100 ranked in SoO and this is slowly becoming mandatory for us as well. I'm curious what your stance on this matter is. Are you happy with it? Looking for solutions?
Not happy with it, but restricting millions of players to save a few hundred from themselves doesn't seem like an ideal solution. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/554654475667767296

Misc
Mentioned it several times that I no longer share plans about the game on Twitter. Hit up @WarcraftDevs for any announcements. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/550778908573200384
So then why do you talk about WoW on your twitter? seems kind of odd..
I like interacting with fans. I think it's important for a dev to empathize with players. Also bugs. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/554518571909271552


The Elder Scrolls Online Drops Subscriptions
The Elder Scrolls Online is dropping subscriptions less than a year after release. Starting on March 17th, 2015, players can just purchase the game and play forever. The same applies to the console version, coming on June 9, 2015.

There will be an optional premium membership called ESO Plus that grants access to DLC content, gives bonuses to character progression speed, and gives players some shop currency. If that membership expires, players will lose access to the DLC areas and quests unless they have purchased them separately, but will keep items and rewards.
