A lot of people suspected there was something wrong with the kill of Yogg+0 by Exodus a few days ago. They were right and Exodus  has been banned for exploiting a bug in this fight. Obviously, their kill has been removed from the Hall of Fame 

Offense: Abuse of Game Mechanics
Details: Circumvention of normal combat mechanics to defeat the Yogg-Saron encounter inside the Ulduar raid instance.

In our many attempts at trying to figure out a way to defeat Yogg zero watcher, we found a way to use bugged game mechanics to make phase 3 easier in zero watcher then one watcher.

The bug is when someone is left inside the brain room of Yogg-Saron, they can still get aggro on the adds that spawn in phase 3. That means if you have someone getting healing aggro in the brain room, they will get aggro on the adds, which cause them to evade in place and allows for all of your raids dps to be focused on Yogg.

We discovered this mechanic on a wipe, and decided to see if we could actually get it to work. The first attempt after that wipe, we realized it worked, and went with it and killed it on that attempt.

This bug has been hotfixed on all servers. 
Immortal Guardians are now able to target players in the "illusion room" of Yogg-Saron with their summoning ability. This hotfix has been fully deployed to all regions.

We're also in the process of deploying a hotfix for an issue with Immortal Guardians that could cause them to pause their movement before reaching melee range. This fix will also prevent the Immortal Guardian from running away if their target is stunned.
