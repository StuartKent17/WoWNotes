Patch 8.1 - Demonology Warlock Changes
In the current build up on the PTR Public Test Realm, a few changes were made to the Demonic Consumption level 100 talent:


Any imp that the Demonic Tyrant consumes now has a chance to grant you the Demonic Core https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/267102-demonic-core buff. If your Tyrant consumes six imps when summoned, you have six individual chances to get a Demonic Core buff applied to you.
The damage buff to the Demonic Tyrant from consuming the Wild Imps is now much higher.

One additional note about the Demonic Tyrant https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/265187-summon-demonic-tyrant: 

In an upcoming build, the Demonic Tyrant will also extend the duration of any demons summoned from the Nether Portal level 100 talent.


Play with the Blues - Nov 8
We're planning another testing session for the new Darkshore Warfront coming in Tides of Vengeance, and would love for you to join us!

Tomorrow, November 8, beginning at 4 PM Pacific time 7 PM Eastern, we'll be queuing for the new Warfront. As with previous tests, we'll be making a couple PTR-only changes: there will be special queuing tables set up in Orgrimmar and Zandalar, and any character level 110 or higher will be able to participate.

Additionally, there are a couple of changes to the Darkshore zone that we've enabled for testing purposes which we'd like to clarify. All of the Darkshore World Quests are currently active on PTR, and both factions are able to loot the treasures scattered around the zone. After release, only the faction that currently holds the zone will be able to loot the treasures, and only a handful of the World Quests will be enabled at any one time.

We hope to see you tomorrow evening!


WoW Secret Finding Discord Discovers Music Secret in Waycrest Manor
The WoW Secret Finding Discord https://discord.gg/wowsecrets has discovered the musical easter egg in Waycrest Manor https://warcraft-secrets.com/musical-easter-egg-waycrest-manor that was mentioned during the Immersive Sounds of Azeroth Panel https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8134-Immersive-Sounds-of-Azeroth at Blizzcon.


5 pipe organs afflicted by drust magic are found throughout Waycrest Manor. 
Walking near them spawns a witch that you need to kill.
Lady Waycrest will become angry and play a discord chord on her organ when you kill one.
After you have killed all 5 witches and cleared the instance, return to "The Grand Foyer" at the entrance.
After a few minutes music from other Blizzard games will begin to play!


The music plays a loop of 6 familiar tracks.
