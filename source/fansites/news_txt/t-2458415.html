We&#x2019;re always testing out new ways to improve the viewer experience for the Overwatch Path to Pro ecosystem. As part of this, Contenders is trialing a new chat moderation program that requires users who wish to participate in Twitch chat to link their Blizzard Battle.net and Twitch accounts.<br>
<br>
The program will be trialed during 2018 Season 3 quarterfinals matches across all regions, from Dec. 28, 2018, through Jan. 12, 2019. The Path to Pro team then will evaluate the program&#x2019;s overall effect on creating a more positive viewing experience.<br>
<br>
To link your Battle.net and Twitch accounts, log into Twitch, visit https://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections, and select the &#x201C;Connect&#x201D; option under Blizzard Battle.net. Users who try to chat with unlinked accounts will be met with an automatic reply and prompted to link their accounts.<br>
