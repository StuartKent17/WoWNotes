What is Launching This Week?
Lots of things! The bigger changes are listed in sections below, but there are also smaller things:

Many items have been converted to toys. 
Classes that can use Mail and Plate no longer graduate to a higher armor level, they just start with the ability to use their armor type.
All creatures and NPCs can now be tapped by up to 5 other characters.
The Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza has taken a temporary hiatus.
Set bonuses for item sets from expansions prior to Warlords of Draenor have been deactivated, though the text describing their former function still remains.

Talents

Dual spec is gone! You can swap between all of your specs now. 
Changing specs will be free, and change your actions bars and optionally transmog. 
Changing talents will be free in a city or your Order Hall.
Changing talents out in the field will require a reagent crafted by Inscription.

Transmogrification and Wardrobe Changes
Blizzard has a nice overview of the Wardrobe system here http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/417180-preview-wardrobe-updates/. 


You can now hide your shoulders!
You can transmog weapon enchants, shirts, and tabards. 
You need to visit a Transmogrification NPC to hide your cloak, helm, or shoulders now. 
Old quest rewards and items you already have should be automatically added to your wardrobe when the patch is live. 
If one color of an appearance comes from multiple items, you just need to collect one of them.
To collect an appearance, you need to be able to equip the item, it must be your primary armor type, and it must be obtainable and equippable by your class. 
Don't forget to grab Arsenal: Draenor Challenger's Armaments http://beta.wowdb.com/items/136854-arsenal-draenor-challengers-armaments if you are eligible. 



http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/wardrobeBanner.jpg http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/417180-preview-wardrobe-updates/ 

http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/appearAchieve.png http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/character/collections/appearances?sort=reward 


PvP Changes
The PvP system received a large overhaul for Legion, allowing for easier and better balancing. 


Honor Points and Conquest Points were removed. 
Items now cost Mark of Honor http://beta.wowdb.com/items/137642-mark-of-honor, obtained from Battlegrounds, Arenas, and Skirmishes.
The 5v5 Arena bracket has been retired. "Arena Master http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/1174-the-arena-master" achievement has been converted into a Feat of Strength.
Winning a Battleground with characters below level 110 now awards a Crate of Battlefield Goods http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Crate%20Battlefield%20Goods. Players on the opposing team also have a chance to receive a crate with an increasing chance based on team score at the end of a match. The crate contains a piece of armor appropriate for the character’s level and specialization with a chance for the crate to contain additional rewards such as weapons or relics.
PvP stat templates http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/417264-pvp-stat-templates-and-spell-multipliers-july-15th-2016/ are active.



UI Changes
Lots of changes are coming to the UI, so we have compiled them in a separate post. 


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/uichanges.jpg http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5841-Legion-UI-Changes 


Dungeon and Raid Changes
There are a few changes coming to Hellfire Citadel, but the mounts and heirloom trinkets will be around for a little longer.:


Tuning is ongoing http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/416379-feedback-hellfire-citadel/#post139 to ensure that Hellfire Citadel remains slightly easier than it was before the patch. 
Many of the trinkets have been nerfed. 
Loot from Normal difficulty and higher is part of the new upgrade system, with a chance to be randomly upgraded some multiple of 5 item levels. 
You can still obtain the Grove Warden http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/189999-grove-warden, Ironhoof Destroyer http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/171621-ironhoof-destroyer, and Felsteel Annihilator http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/182912-felsteel-annihilator, they change with the expansion launch.
You can still obtain the heirloom trinkets http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-reqlvl-min=100&filter-quality=128&filter-slot=4096 that scale to 110 from Mythic dungeons until the expansion launches.
The ability to start the legendary quest line has been removed, but you can keep working on it if you already are on the quest.
Normalized gold from Legacy raids prior to Warlords of Draenor. Heroic difficulty Cataclysm Raids now award less gold than before, while raids from Mists of Pandaria and Wrath of the Lich King will now award more gold.



Gold and Garrison Changes
A few changes are coming to Garrisons in this patch:


Some Garrison follower upgrades such as Goredrenched Weaponry http://beta.wowdb.com/items/114622-goredrenched-weaponry now sell for significantly less. 
Treasure Hunter http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/abilities/256-treasure-hunter is replaced by Extreme Scavenger http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/abilities/256-extreme-scavenger
The especially rewarding missions that reward gold, such as Blood, Gold, and Regret http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/missions/618-blood-gold-and-regret are being changed to reward something else, such as Apexis Crystals, Oil, Primal Spirit http://beta.wowdb.com/items/120945-primal-spirit, or other non-gold rewards.
Felblight http://beta.wowdb.com/items/127759-felblight is now sold at the Primal Trader in your garrison for 25 x Primal Spirit http://beta.wowdb.com/items/120945-primal-spirit.
Big Crate of Salvage http://www.wowdb.com/items/114120-big-crate-of-salvage will no longer be rewarded, existing crates will be unaffected. You can still get transmog gear http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743184423?page=3#42.
Large Crate of Salvage http://beta.wowdb.com/items/140590-large-crate-of-salvage replaces the old crate. 
The number of Pet Charms http://beta.wowdb.com/items/116415-pet-charm#related:reward-of-quest rewarded by quests have been halved. 
The Garrison Resource cost of many items on the Trader NPC at the Trading Post have been increased. 
The amount of Garrison Resources rewarded by the random dungeon quest has been reduced. 
The maximum amount of gold that can be held at once has been increased to 9,999,999 gold. Guild bank maximum has also been increased to 9,999,999 gold.
Potion of Luck http://beta.wowdb.com/items/93351-potion-of-luck and Greater Potion of Luck http://beta.wowdb.com/items/76091-greater-potion-of-luck no longer have an effect.
