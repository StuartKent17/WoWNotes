This morning, the Armor showroom (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=204) has been updated with the new tooltips, I&apos;ll progressively switch the whole site on the new tooltip system but it takes a lot of time to do it, stay tuned. Tier 6 Armor should be in the showroom soon.<br>
<br>
Black Temple<br>
Kaib from Bad Omen (http://www.badomen.info/) made a post on Elitistjerks Forums (http://elitistjerks.com/showpost.php?p=347388&amp;postcount=33) with a few new loots, not posting more informations here because we&apos;re not sure if these are the final stats yet. (Some items introduced in 2.1.0 had their stats changed in yesterday&apos;s update)<br>
<br>
Enchantments<br>
Made a small compilation of new enchantments effects.<br>

Weapons<br>
Endarion (again ! thanks to him) sent me some screenshots with color variations of already known items (even the tier 5 warlock sword has multiple colors). We can&apos;t really tell if it will be used in game in the near future, or if it will be released a lot later like it was in BC with the alternate version of tier 2 armor skins. <br>
