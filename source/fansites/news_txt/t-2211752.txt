Orphan Whistle in Battlegrounds
This was a bug, and should now be resolved. 

Let me know if you continue to see that the Whistle is unusable in battlegrounds! Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1059980-orphan-whistle/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20754326995?page=1#19

Character Talent Customization
There is nothing "unique" about having to ask the Internet about every single point you spent and hoping the group leader's prefered cookie cutter build was the same as yours. 

We may have less options numerically, but in practice we have more choices by a long shot.
There's a bit of an 'illusion' of choice that came with them, and that's really what people hold on to.

When folks say, "Oh, but you could make a unique build" - could you? Shockadin wasn't unique, for example, there were tons of them running around, all following the same guide that they read online. I do agree that it made people feel like they had more choice, but most of that was filling in passives to move down the tree which isn't super exciting.

I think there are benefits to both styles - and, yeah, we still have cookie cutter builds today, but its something we try to be more aware of generally - but its hard to avoid there always being a "best" set of talents.

Thing is Ornyx, nothing has changed in this regard. There is still an illusion of choice in many talent builds feral being a glaring example of this for max dps. If you're not using the max dps build in any class / spec.. you're sub optimal.
I think that's true - and wasn't trying to say otherwise. As said, there are obviously still build guides, and there are definitely 'best' talent choices out there.

It's something the class design team is constantly working on. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1059979-do-you-miss-making-your-character-unique/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20754487457?page=3#44
