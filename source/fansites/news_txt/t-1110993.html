Premade Monks Now Active<br>

WoWDB Pet Pages<br>
Work continues at a steady pace on WoWDB (http://www.wowdb.com/), with the addition of more information for Pets. We now have dedicated pages for all of the Battle Pets (http://www.wowdb.com/pets) and a list of all of the Battle Pet abilities (http://www.wowdb.com/pet-abilities). <br>
<br>
Important - The Pet List only lists the companion pets fully implemented in the game files, we&apos;ll have to wait for future beta patches to get data on all the other pets. However, there&apos;s already a lot of Pet Abilities implemented, check them out!<br>
<br>
The pages for individual abilities will show you which pets the attack is strong against, and which pets the attack is weak against. Each pet&apos;s page will show you which other pets it is resistant against and which pets it is most vulnerable to. We will continue to add features as the system is fully implemented in the beta.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re starting to have a lot of background work done on WoWDB and you can expect more visible updates very soon (Including filters and anything to make browsing less painful). We also have a few surprises coming this week if everything goes really well. <br>

SM and Scholomance Armor Models<br>
We discussed this topic with the developers last week a bit. I don&apos;t have any conclusive information for you, but they recognize there are a lot of cool items in SM and Scholomance, and they want to try and preserve those in Mists.

PvP in Mists of Pandaria: 3v3 Arena<br>
I have already commented in your Arena system needs to evolve thread and it was a very good read, so I will move onto your other points. About the &#x201C;Roller Coaster&#x201D; feel that you commented on, there will always be nerfs and buffs and that is because we want to achieve the best balance possible among the classes. However, we do our utmost to limit actual spell/ability changes that effect rotations to expansions only, and that is only if we feel it will greatly improve the class. <br>
<br>
The new talent system should make constant changes less necessary too, especially with regard to forced respecs since the talents are now more utility-based. In my own personal opinion about changing classes because of a nerf, I feel that I will play what I enjoy the most and right now, as it has been in the past is my warrior. But because in some parts of arena he may struggle does not make me want to play it less.<br>
<br>
Your portion about instant CC, healing and damage is very well structured and thought out, the same goes for your comments on self-healing and blanket silences. This is a great thread Rasen, that we can see you have dedicated a lot of time to writing and we hope to see more excellent feedback like this coming from everyone on the forums.
