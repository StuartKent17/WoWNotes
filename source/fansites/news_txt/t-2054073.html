<br>
Rune of Razorice now correctly increases the damage of some previously unaffected Frost abilities.<br>
Unholy<br>
<br>
Clawing Shadows damage has been changed to 130% weapon damage (was 150% Attack Power) and now requires facing the target.<br>
<br>

<br>
Havoc<br>
<br>
Demon Blades now generates 12-20 Fury (was 15-20).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Balance<br>
<br>
Blessing of Elune now increases Astral Power generation by 25% (was 40%).<br>
Blessing of An&apos;she now grants 2 Astral Power every 3 seconds (was 2 Astral Power every 2.5 seconds).<br>
Lunar Strike now generates 12 Astral Power (was 10).<br>
Mastery: Starlight bonus has been increased to 2%/point (was 1.75%).<br>
Moonfire and Sunfire DoT damage has been decreased to 50% per tick (was 55%).<br>
Shooting Stars gives 4 Astral Power (was 5).<br>
Solar Wrath now generates 8 Astral Power (was 6).<br>
Developer&apos;s Note: We shifted some Astral Power generation from the level 90 talent row into the baseline spec. This both improves gameplay sub level 90 and reduces reliance on these talents at max level.<br>
<br>
<br>

Fire Mage critical strike chance has been increased by 5%.<br>
Critical Mass multiplier has been decreased to 1.1 (was 1.3).<br>
Developer&apos;s Note: We shifted some critical strike chance from a multiplier on gear to a flat bonus. This brings the value of critical strike for Fire closer to other stats and also limits the very high amounts of critical strike chance that can be reached with certain gear.<br>
<br>

Rupture damage has been decreased to 25% Attack Power (was 30%).<br>
Agonizing Poison now stacks 5 times (was 4).<br>
