Mission Complete Addon<br>
If you enjoy Breeze (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/breeze) but want to click even less to go through completed missions, the Mission Complete (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/mission-complete) addon will go through all of your missions and complete them as fast as possible, outputting the rewards to chat. A similar feature was also added to Master Plan (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/master-plan) yesterday.<br>
<br>

Class Balance Changes<br>
Blizzard let us know that class balance changes are coming, even for Shaman (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/536960532322844672)!<br>
We&apos;re aware that shaman DPS is low and are planning to buff it. (Source (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/536960532322844672))<br>
<br>
Re: class balance - yes, we&apos;re planning to make adjustments. Currently gathering data to help us make the right changes. Don&apos;t want to under/overdo changes and have to buff/nerf again after.<br>
Honestly hope you aren&apos;t just relying on 5ms? Some classes look amazing in 5mans, but won&apos;t be margins ahead in raids.<br>
Definitely not. We&apos;re looking forward to getting raid data.<br>
PvE or PvP side ?<br>
Both (Source (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/536963726482493442))<br>
Will the changes be prior or after initial progression though? choosing which spec to gear is kinda important.<br>
Depends on what you&apos;re considering &quot;initial progression.&quot; Likely to be after Normal raids open. Need that raid data. (Source (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/536964938388873218))<br>
Why do you need that data? You&apos;ve got MC data, you&apos;ve got simulations that you guys bragged on at BlizzCon.<br>
A class can have amazing patchwerk DPS and completely suck on raid encounters with actual mechanics. MC data is a tool. Simulations are a tool. We&apos;d like to make use of every tool available. (Source (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/536977013165146112))<br>
<br>
Now I have another question: are you saying that because you actually got updates on it or is it just to quell us?<br>
They&apos;re still in testing and not yet ready to be communicated. Class tuning changes will only be included as a whole package after being tested. Posting half of it will invariably cause unneeded distress. Check back tomorrow. (Source (https://twitter.com/Rygarius/status/537069300180594688))<br>

Patch 6.0.3 Hotfixes - November 24<br>
World Environment<br>
<br>
[Requires a realm restart.] The time that corpses persist in the world has been restored back to their former durations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeons, Raids, and Scenarios<br>
<br>
Dungeons<br>
<br>
[Requires a realm restart.] Resolved an issue where players were unable to queue through Dungeon Finder while in Warspear or Stormshield.<br>
Upper Blackrock Spire<br>
<br>
During the Commander Tharbek encounter, Black Iron Guards no longer join in the fight when he is at 10% health.<br>
Commander Tharbek should no longer be using Iron Axe, Imbued Iron Axe, and Iron Reaver within 4 seconds of each other.<br>
Orebender Gor&apos;ashan&apos;s Electric Pulse should now correctly hit players that are standing on a Rune Conduit.<br>
Son of the Beast&apos;s Fiery Trail should no longer persist and continue to damaging pets after being defeated.<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Miner&apos;s Coffee (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118897-miners-coffee) should no longer be incorrectly applying its speed buff outside of the Garrison&apos;s mine.<br>
Swapblaster (http://www.wowdb.com/items/111820-swapblaster) should no longer be incorrectly swapping locations with targets other than another party member.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Enchanting - Lack of Draenic Dust<br>
Please fix this profession. It is the only building in my garrison that sits with zero work being done. <br>
<br>
Dust is far too rare, and much to valuable to use on work orders, when the daily cool downs are so important.<br>
As a personal anecdote, my character&apos;s Enchanter&apos;s Study is experiencing a similar issue with a lack of work orders submitted when the other buildings are humming along with a constant stream of work orders. We feel that Enchanting Dust can be a bit too scarce to come by and are looking at ways to ease those supply concerns.<br>
<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
PvP<br>
81,000 Honor Points farmed and not a single Warforged Dagger are they even real? People have them...<br>
Very rare (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/536276964882272256))<br>
