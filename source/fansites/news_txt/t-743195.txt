The Guild UI has been disabled during last night's maintenance but I guess a few people want to see how it looks for the moment. Not all parts of the UI are available yet, and I'd rather wait for the official launch on beta servers before I start posting because it looks like they're still changing a lot of things. Hopefuly it will be fixed on beta servers very soon.

Cataclysm - Reforging in Beta
Reforging was added to the official patch notes after last build's update and people keep asking how it works on beta servers. The answer is simple, it doesn't. The UI just doesn't work and it will most likely be included in the next build, the only thing in-game for the moment is the Thaumaturge who will reforge items for you.
