chaud2018-01-02, 02:27 AMMMO-Champion 2017 Recap
It's been an exciting year for MMO-Champion, and we've been busy launching new site features, expanding our coverage of the Blizzard universe, and welcoming new members to our growing community. Let's take a look back at what we've accomplished in 2017 as we start off the new year on a high note.

Security Updates
MMO-Champion recently enabled SSL support for all users! This was previously only enabled only on pages that collected payment information, but now works across the entire site. 

If you want even more security on your account, you can enable two-factor authentication https://www.mmo-champion.com/profile.php?do=twofactor on your account and use Google Authenticator Android https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en / iOS https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8 or Authy https://authy.com to secure your account. Be sure to hold on to your recovery codes, as that is the only way to remove two-factor authentication from your account. 


MMO-Champion 10 Year Anniversary
Earlier this year, we reached a monumental milestone: MMO-Champion's 10 year anniversary https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6379-MMO-Champion-10-Year-Anniversary-Celebration. In addition to a variety of giveaways, community members were able to share their favorite MMOC memories, reminisce on the last 10 years of World of Warcraft news, and even test their MMO-Champion knowledge. Whether you've been a part of the site for years or you're brand new, thank you for spending some of your 2017 with us.

MMO-Champion Premium
MMO-Champion Premium https://www.mmo-champion.com/premiumpromo.php launched in November of this year, and it was primarily developed as a way for the community to support the site and browse MMO-Champion ad-free. Premium also includes a custom forum title and a new forum badge, all for just $0.99/month or $8.99/year. We'd like to thank everyone who has taken advantage of the program thus far, and we're excited to continue adding cool new perks to the Premium program in the future.

BlizzCon 2017
At BlizzCon, the MMO-Champion team was able to say hello to community members, conduct exclusive developer interviews, and hand out a lot of MMO-Champion stickers. Thanks to everyone who took the time to say hello! Your support throughout the years has meant a lot, and we're excited to continue expanding the site in 2018.
