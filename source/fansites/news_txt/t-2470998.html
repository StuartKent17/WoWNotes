Patch 8.1.5 PTR - Cycle of Life Tortollan Quest<br>
The PTR has added an interesting new world quest to the Tortollan lineup called the Cycle of Life. <br>
<br>
<br>
It takes place with Scrollsage Nola (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/134344-scrollsage-nola) and can spawn anywhere that the baby turtle quest Beachhead resides.<br>
This quest is very different from helping baby turtles to the water. Upon reaching it, Nola will tell you &quot;These tiny crabs need help! I hate to see any living things suffer. Would you be willing to lend a hand?&quot;<br>
You then take control of a crab and must move left or right in order to block baby turtles from reaching the water whilst avoiding the orb attacks from Scroll of Blasting (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/292149-scroll-of-blasting).<br>
After blocking a baby turtle, its shell will appear on your head and you can use Throw Turtle Shell (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/292287-throw-turtle-shell) to take out any baby turtles in a line up the beach.<br>
The quest ends when you block 20 baby turtles from the water. Nola exclaims &quot;All creatures in nature must live together in balance. But I can&apos;t help cheering for the little turtles!&quot;<br>
