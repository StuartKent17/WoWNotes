Mist of Pandaria Talent Calculator Updated<br>
The official Mists of Pandaria Talent Calculator has been updated and a couple of classes got major updates to their skills. http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage, http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest, http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior apparently all got significant updates and other classes got minor updates. <br>
<br>
We trust you&#x2019;ve all had ample time to plug away on the Mists of Pandaria Talent Calculator. You may have even found a few mind-bottling class changes in the works (you know, when things are so crazy it gets your thoughts all trapped, like in a bottle?).<br>
<br>
To that end, we&#x2019;re pleased to announce we&#x2019;ve just released an update to the calculator! In addition to bug fixes, we&apos;ve made some changes as a result of your feedback.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind this is still a very early preview of the Mists of Pandaria talent system, which will likely continue to evolve during development of the expansion. We also don&#x2019;t plan on making further updates to the calculator until we get much closer to our testing phase, but rest assured we&#x2019;ll still be considering your feedback throughout the development process.<br>
