I talked about the final version of the item pages a few weeks ago, sadly it took a lot more time than I expected and I couldn't get them ready for the release of the expansion. Hopefully that's nothing a few extra days of work couldn't solve and most of these pages are now ready, they're not as nice as I expected them to be in the first place but most of the information is here and it will probably make your life easier if you're trying to upgrade your gear. 

Items are sorted by slot > spec > ilvl, it could be disturbing at the beginning but it will eventually make sense after a few seconds. If you REALLY want to sort the columns in a different way you can always click their name your cursor won't change, but it works. 

Please report the following issues in comments
Any error you can find. Wrong spec, etc ...
Outdated screenshots there are a few of them, most of the time the item tooltip will be up to date
Missing items

The page for librams / totems / idols / sigils will be available in a few minutes is now available.
