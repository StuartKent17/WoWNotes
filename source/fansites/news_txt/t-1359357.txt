Next Connected Realms
As a part of our ongoing Connected Realms implementation, we will be working toward connecting our next pair of realms, Black Dragonflight and Skullcrusher – we’ll provide another update once we’ve finalized the date. We will also update this thread with any additional information that becomes available. Please be aware that as a part of the process, realm times may change to align better with each other.

We are currently evaluating additional realm connections and plan to provide a more complete schedule at a future point in time.

For more information on Connected Realms, please read the preview blog post here.

I know a lot of you are looking forward to having your realm connected or even just knowing when and who you'll be connected to, but keep in mind that these initial connections are to test the various steps and results of what is a very involved and complicated process. We need to make these initial connections, nail down the processes, find and resolve any issues we run into, etc. before finalizing next steps as the results of the tests will have a direct impact on how and when we make all future connections. The realms connected thus far were chosen specifically to help identify potential issues, and not necessarily because they would benefit the most from a connection.


Blue Tweets
Raid Finder
can you comment on SOO increased LFR drop rate  Are these statistics accurate?
We view LFR each tier as having a finite lifespan whether you finish your gear or not, so we might as well give you the gear. Source 

Has there ever been any consideration to personal rewards for acing mechanics on individual LFR fights?
Yes. We would have to be really, really smart with such a design however for what are probably obvious reasons. Source 

You made a comment in a interview that's helping feed the fire, and people are making assumptions about your intentions.
It would probably be more like LFR requires ilevel 500 OR a Proving Ground Silver Medal, or maybe Silver + ilevel 450 or whatever. Source 

Flex Raiding
Greg, any thoughts on making Flex loot tradeable in guild groups? Got a few items I wish had gone elsewhere. Thanks!
Long term it's probably a requirement, but we currently don't have a way to drop more loot for larger groups. Source 

Can you give us any idea of Flex participation relative to normal? I'm excited to see if it's as highly popular as it seems.
It's as or more popular than normal and growing. It makes sense that flex could grow to be far more popular than normal. Source 


Find Your Friends at the BlizzCon Meeting Stone
BlizzCon is a great place to meet up with friends, guildmates, and other cohorts, and this year we’re providing you with the perfect space right on the show floor. Located between Halls B and C, The Meeting Stone is an easy and recognizable gathering point as it will literally contain a giant life-sized Meeting Stone. No more hiking upstairs to squint at each other in a well-lit room, this year you’ll be able to meet up at this central location and be just a scant few meters away from the main stage, demo areas, and other attractions.

The Blizzard Community Team and other staff members will be on-hand to interact with those summoned to the Meeting Stone and to mitigate potential corpse camping. We’ll be putting together a schedule to reserve space and times for larger groups, to also be displayed at the event.
Please visit the new Meeting Stone forum  if you’re interested in arranging a specific time for your group meetup.
