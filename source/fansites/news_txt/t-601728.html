&quot;LOL ! You suck ! They removed them 2 months ago !&quot;. That&apos;s true. But they&apos;re back ! And it will let you get 5 [item=32897]. Always nice to have 5 free flasks for running &quot;old&quot; instances again.<br>

Blizzcon<br>
Blizzard updated the Blizzcon site (http://www.blizzard.com/blizzcon07/) with tons of links about pretty much everything that happened here. (Yup, our changes list is here !)<br>
<br>
Meanwhile on PvPScene.com<br>
No uber articles today, but I posted a small compilations of PvP movies (http://www.pvpscene.com/index.php?topic=119.0). They&apos;re all pretty good and it will probably keep you busy one more hour this week end. <br>
<br>
Comics<br>
It&apos;s been a while, but they&apos;re back ! Some of them are a bit old, and I even repost the LFG musical short (but it&apos;s great !). Expect the usual updates to be back tomorrow.<br>
