First, let&apos;s start with a short blue post from Hortus. Basically the 2.2 is full of new music and sounds to keep you busy in Inns while you are not playing (hopefully because you&apos;re alt tabbing on this site) (Change list is Full recap of 2.2 changes)<br>
Yes, there is new sound in many Inns throughout the world.<br>

Website<br>
wobbles pointed out on the forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=483.0) that the RSS feed of the site sucks, and I totally agree with him. The feed was previously limited to 255 characters and it wouldn&apos;t show many infos about the news in your favorite RSS feed reader. I pushed this limit to 4000, I hope this will be enough. (Reminder : News RSS Feed is here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?type=rss;action=.xml;board=2.0;sa=news;)).<br>
