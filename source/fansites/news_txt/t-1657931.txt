Armory Stats - Mists of Pandaria Challenge Modes
Before we get too far into Warlords of Draenor, there are a few outstanding requests for some final armory stats. This sample was updated right up until Patch 6.0.2 went live and looks at accounts active from September 1st onwards, which was 2.3 million accounts and 6.8 million characters.

The first chart looks at the overall percentage of players that have each challenge mode achievement. The second chart defines a participating player as one with the bronze achievement for that challenge mode. 

If there are any other final requests that use pre-6.0.2 Mists of Pandaria data please let us know in the comments, as the data will be wiped when new data collection begins in a week.


Challenge Conqueror: Bronze  - 11.1% of players
Challenge Conqueror: Silver  - 11.1% of players
Challenge Conqueror: Gold  - 10.3% of players

Any chance you're working on fixing the Guard tooltip value seems to be off by 100% as if pre hotfix?
Aye, we're sometimes unable to update tooltip values when we hotfix the effectiveness of spells, until the next client patch. Celestalon 

I know MS has two rolls and each has X/2% chance in PVE. How does it work in PVP? One roll of X% or X/2%?
That's a mix of old and wrong info. Correct is simple:X% Multistrike = one X% roll in PvP, two X% rolls in PvE Celestalon 

Mind Sear can't beat Mind Flay? Howling Blast beats Icy Touch w/o proc. Nerf Howling Blast?
Howling Blast is intended to be used in single target. Mind Sear is not. Celestalon 

Art
Any chance boar mount running animation could get adjusted somehow? Currently it's really jittery.
They have tiny legs! Muffinus 

Character / Items
How is Shattered Hand refresh supposed to work? Pandemic or just straight refresh?
Shattered Bleed is a bit unusual. Static damage, doesn't roll. Refreshes do NOT get Pandemic. Shared DoT between hands. WarcraftDevs 
So there is no point in having it on both weapons?
It still does direct damage, and isn't necessarily 100% uptime with it only on 1 weapon. Celestalon 

PvP
the gap in pvp and normal gear now is just unbareable even despite your efforts. pvp is no longer fun for me.
Hm that's surprising to hear. The gap is closer than it was throughout MoP. holinka 

Why does a 620/675 item need rep to be used?
PvP gearing needs more variety than "earn currency, go to vendor" holinka 

I was curious how strongboxes work? I've done random BG, never get one. Is there specific bgs that give them? #nubquestion
All bgs give them. Winners always get gold, losers get silver or bronze based on final score. holinka 

Have y'all ever considered BiS PvP gearing being easily accessible and fast for everyone? Regardless of casual or competitive?
The game might be better if people could get to the peak ilevel in a straightforward manner, but min-maxing took more engagement. holinka 

Any chance we'll see removal of the "Ashran Bonus". It simply isn't fun for a lot of people and goes against removing the RBG bonus
Probably not holinka 

Lore
I have a really strange question for you: Is Lost Veil Anzu where Sketh'lon Base Camp would be in our main Outland timeline?
Probably a happy coincidence, but might've planned it. DaveKosak 

Garrisons
Proposed solution would allow follower customization over time. Randomness keeps from creating super followers, least not quickly.
There are already follower re-roll tokens, perhaps too rare though. Muffinus 

Misc
WoDevelopment Log: At one point, I spent at least an hour thinking about what grown-up Awbee's  name would be. Awbwegos? Muffinus 


Computers - Setup of the Month
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolution, we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices  are trending slightly downward again over the past few months, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. 

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 4790K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions!
