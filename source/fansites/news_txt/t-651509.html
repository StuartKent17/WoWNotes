Compensation for Players on Select Realms<br>
As many are aware, the below realms were down for an extended period of time on Tuesday while we implemented some network improvements, applied a minor content patch and performed weekly maintenance. Unfortunately, the network improvements caused unforeseen issues that led to an excessive period of down time. Given that these realms were not playable for a period of time that exceeded our expectations, we will be crediting all accounts with characters on these realms with 24 hours of game time within the next two weeks.<br>
<br>
Please check the Account Management page after the two-week period to verify the game time has been successfully added to your account. As always, thank you for the patience you displayed during Tuesday&#x2019;s extended maintenance period.<br>

Introducing the Bosstiary<br>
They say that curiosity killed the cat, but sometimes curiosity can pay off in gold and loot. Countless adventurers have given their lives to seek out more information on the dangers that lurk within the treacherous dungeons of Azeroth. They have set their sights on Ulduar, and have not only provided a map of this titan stronghold, but have also delved into the history of each of the bosses within, producing a quick and easy reference for each.<br>
<br>
If you&apos;ve ever been curious as to the lore behind the faces that thwart your dreams of fame and fortune, look no further than our newest site addition, the Bosstiary. Search the map and simply mouse over the boss icons to learn more about each one. Satisfy your curiosity here: http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/3p1/bosstiary.html (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/3p1/bosstiary.html)<br>

Tigole / Kalgan<br>
Tigole did switch over to help in the development of the unannounced MMO. Kalgan is still around, but is very busy these days and doesn&apos;t have as much time to post on the forums. He&apos;s a very valuable asset to us for insight and information and has a great team of people working with him to really bring some great things to World of Warcraft in the coming months/years.

Raids &amp; Dungeons<br>
Classes performance in Ulduar<br>
No, my point was that class balance is judged by the Ulduar encounters. If there were 10 encounters with no raid damage, then there wouldn&apos;t be as much discussion about AE healing. If there were more fights like XT and Ignis, then Feral druids would have even bigger dps numbers. If there was less AE, then Unholy DKs wouldn&apos;t look so good. If we had a fight where the boss used Mortal Strike then Disc priests might feel overpowered. If we had 10 fights like that, you&apos;d likely see forum QQ.<br>
<br>
I am saying there is no such thing as &quot;I do this much dps&quot; or &quot;I do this much healing.&quot; It just depends on what you do on the specific encounters, and that in turn has a great deal to do with the mechanics of the encounter. Nobody cares what your damage was on Flame Leviathan. The original question was on whether shamans should use CH on &quot;most&quot; encounters. My answer was that it depends on what most encounters are like. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17619782879-shamanpve-is-blizzard-still-not-convinced.html))<br>
<br>
DPS players pulling aggro from the tank<br>
We have made threat much less important than at previous times in WoW. It&apos;s still a part of the game though. Our design is not that you just ignore threat and attempt to do maximum dps. If you are wiping because of enrage timers (meaning you can&apos;t chill out your dps much more), then we are more sympathetic. If you&apos;re dying because you keep pulling off the tank, then it might not necessarily be your class mechanics that is to blame.<br>
<br>
Some of this falls on your tank too. If he or she is just stacking stamina and ignores anything that can improve dps, then you might want to reconsider your strategy. Also don&apos;t discount threat transfer abilities like Misdirection and Tricks of the Trade. Maximizing threat is almost as important as survival for tanks, and don&apos;t let them try to tell you otherwise.

<br>
Threat management on Hodir hard mode<br>
Look, those buffs of which you speak are not just there so you can do spectacular damage. They are part of the encounter. Managing your threat when doing the huge dps that those buffs give you is part of the encounter. If we hadn&apos;t wanted that, we would have given them a passive threat reduction aura or something. Trying to maximize your dps within a small window is what that fight is all about.<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t know your tanks. If you say they&apos;re awesome, I&apos;ll take your word for it. Do you know if they try resist gear for the hard mode? Some do. Some don&apos;t. Threat is obviously a much bigger deal if they do. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17619783279-warlock-threat-management.html))<br>

Classes<br>
Making healing less spammy<br>
We want healing to be less spammy and more deliberate, but that won&apos;t work until overhealing matters. To get to that point, mana regen has to matter but the risk of the tank dying in two boss hits also has to be chilled out.

<br>
One-spell healing<br>
Neither shamans nor druids are intentionally designed to use one spell as an absolutely primary spell. My beta-era comment about CH was that we didn&#x2019;t want to give it a cooldown or the like as Circle of Healing had. Don&#x2019;t over-interpret &#x201C;core&#x201D; or &#x201C;iconic&#x201D; as &#x201C;absolutely primary spell.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s overstating it. Having a spell you use 90% or more of the time is really lame, unless it is propped up a great deal by other talents the way the mage nukes are.

Video of new forms<br>
We&apos;re working on text and photo previews for much of the content that will be available in the next major content patch. Each preview takes a great deal of time to prepare, as they generally require coordination with multiple different departments (i.e. art team, development, creative development, community, public relations, web, and so on), and each of these departments have large lists of tasks to work on nearly all the time. In addition, these previews require coordination with all of our international teams, including textual translations into all of our supported languages.<br>
<br>
It is for this reason that we do not plan on providing videos of the animated new form art. These forms will be available for testing on the public test realms in due time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/17619783666-animation-preview.html))<br>

Holy Paladins<br>
We understand a lot of players like the play style of paladins. We aren&apos;t interested in turning them into priests by any stretch. What we would like to do is make having more than one Holy paladin in a raid slightly more attractive. If you do a 10-player raid with 2 Holy paladins and 1 Resto druid, you should not feel gimped. If you have excess Resto druids, one of them can always hot and Nourish a tank. If you have excess Holy paladins, then you have one of them just using Flash on the rogues or furiously overhealing them with HL.<br>
<br>
We like healing niches and we think we are pretty close with them currently. If there was a healing niche of say &quot;Good at healing melee on very long and heavily magical fights&quot; I think everyone would agree that is probably too narrow a niche. We just need to make sure healers feel somewhat useful even when they are not in the perfect healing situation for their particular class.

Lack of rogue changes<br>
Generally speaking the classes that get the most attention are the ones seeing the most issues. Being near the top of damage meters and having good success in PvP likely means a class will see few changes or (if anything) nerfs.

Upcoming Restoration Changes<br>
We do have some changes in store for Resto. Some of them will be revealed in the upcoming class Q&amp;A and more as we get closer to the next patch. It&apos;s possible we&apos;ll even touch Chain Heal. My point was more that we like shamans casting spells other than Chain Heal, and that one difference between a good and bad shaman can be that the former knows when to use CH and when to use LHW. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17619782879-shamanpve-is-blizzard-still-not-convinced.html))<br>
<br>
Chain Heal not useful on all fights<br>
If an AE isn&apos;t situational then we are just back to shamans casting CH even when only one target has taken damage. What a lot of players are arguing is that it works fine situationally, it&apos;s just that those situations don&apos;t happen often enough and even when they do, the other healers can still show them up. <br>
<br>
[...] It is iconic in our minds, but I&apos;m not sure delving into the nuance of the words is that useful. It&apos;s fine for it not to be useful on every encounter, though it&apos;s possible it isn&apos;t used on enough encounters right now. I would hesitate to say things like &quot;most&quot; because that is entirely dependent on the encounters. If Ulduar didn&apos;t have Mimiron and Vezax and instead had Patchwerk, the damage and healing meters coming out would look very different.
