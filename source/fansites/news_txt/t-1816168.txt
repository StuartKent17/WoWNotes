PvP and Racials
so now that EMFH has been addressed, the ladders will fill with horde players, right? and massive numbers of alliance will go horde, right? and queue times for ashran will drop below an hour, right?
As I've said before, we don't think improving racial balance will suddenly prompt a ton of Alliance players to transfer to Horde. We don't really expect this change to have a huge effect on Alliance queue times, which is fine, because that's not why we made it. We're looking into other options to help that issue.

Quick followup: we've got a hotfix in the works to correct the bug where the Alliance Conquest vendors aren't selling the Adaptation Versatility Medallion, and the Horde Conquest vendors aren't selling the Cruelty Critical Strike Medallion. The hotfix is still in testing, but our goal is to get that out today.
Looks like this hotfix is rolling out now. These trinkets should be available on all realms shortly if they're not already.

Will Blizzard be offering free faction transfers in an attempt to balance the factions?
I'll bring it up. It's worth noting that we've done that before and it really wasn't very effective. I think most people look at free transfers as something other people will do. "Once free transfers open, everyone else will leave and I, my guild, and my friends will be fine right here."

I don't get to make these sorts of decisions, so don't take this as anything more than me asking way more important people what they think. But I'll bring it up.

Lore
sorry to drag you into this but how canonical should we take Hearthstone as lore? I mean it's not all canon in WoW right?
HS is a game played in WoW's inns, thus HS's things exist, but may not be "real" per se. Like you buying a Transformers toy. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/617423640099991553

Garrisons
Why nerf the arcane constructs from the mage tower? It's no longer possible to use them to jump up onto the Ashran Portal tower.
It's a bug, result of a fix that caused people to fall through the world, fixed in small patch. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/616782435808841729
