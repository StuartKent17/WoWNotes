Recent Action Against Real-Money Raid Clears<br>
We&#x2019;ve recently taken action against a number of accounts that were actively participating in and/or advertising the sale of in-game raid or dungeon clears in exchange for real-world currency. Such behavior is a clear violation of the World of Warcraft Terms of Use.<br>
<br>
Of the players affected, many were members of top raiding guilds. We want to be clear that everyone we&#x2019;ve taken action against had illustrated full knowledge and intent to violate the Terms of Use. Going forward, in order to ensure fair play and competitive integrity, we&#x2019;ll be monitoring these activities much more closely in order to make sure that the rules are being followed. This includes selling services for real money, account-sharing, and other violations.<br>
<br>
Note that while selling assistance with obtaining items, achievements, PvP rating, or other in-game benefits for real-world currency is against the Terms of Use, selling those things in exchange for in-game gold is perfectly legitimate. Players should not feel as though participating in a &#x201C;gold run&#x201D; is going to result in negative action taken against their account.<br>
<br>
If you see people advertising these services, please help us keep the game clean by reporting them. If you&#x2019;re unsure, here are some common warning signs:<br>
<br>
<br>
A &#x201C;broker&#x201D; is offering to match buyers with service-providers. Commonly, a broker will collect real-world currency from a buyer while offering gold to a guild or group that will actually provide the service. Someone offering a service is unwilling to discuss terms of payment via in-game tells, and insists on using a non-Blizzard application to communicate.<br>
<br>
Also note that Patch 7.2 includes some improvements to our reporting features to add clearer categories for reporting listings in the Premade Group Finder. We&#x2019;re disappointed to see members of the raiding community participating in behaviors that clearly violate the Terms of Use, and want to be clear that such activities will not be tolerated.</div></div>
