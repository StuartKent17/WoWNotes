Midwinter (http://www.mwguild.net/v3/) (US-Ysera) was the first guild to complete Glory of the Icecrown Raider (25 player) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4603/glory-of-the-icecrown-raider-25-player/) and I totally forgot to report it. Shame on me, and congratulations to them! <br>

Patch 3.3.3 Battlegrounds and Honor Changes<br>
Patch 3.3.3 brings a couple of changes to the Battleground system, the new system is heavily inspired from the current random dungeon system and it should be pretty easy to understand. <br>
<br>
Random Battleground and Call to Arms<br>
Call to Arms are no longer a quests and are directly integrated to the battlegrounds interface, a new &quot;Random Battleground&quot; option has been added and give you the same honor bonus as the Call To Arms, but applied to any battleground. <br>
<br>
The first time you win a Call to Arms or a Random Battleground, you gain 30 Honorable Kills worth of bonus honor and 25 Arena points.<br>
Losing the battleground doesn&apos;t remove the ability to get this bonus, you can just try again.<br>
After you won a Random Battleground or a Call To Arms for the first time of the day, the bonus is lowered to 15 Honorable Kills worth of bonus honor.<br>
You can only get the 30 HK bonus honor for a Call to Arms or a Random Battleground once in a day, the bonuses aren&apos;t &quot;stackable&quot; and both are lowered to 15 HK. (See screenshot) <br>

<br>
Honor Prices Changes / Battleground Marks Removal<br>
All the battleground marks are being removed from the game. <br>
<br>
Players will be able to exchange all their marks (AV (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/20560/alterac-valley-mark-of-honor/), AB (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/20559/arathi-basin-mark-of-honor/), EoTS (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/29024/eye-of-the-storm-mark-of-honor/), IQ (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/47395/isle-of-conquest-mark-of-honor/), SoTA (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/42425/strand-of-the-ancients-mark-of-honor/), WG (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/20558/warsong-gulch-mark-of-honor/)) for Commendation of Service (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/54637/commendation-of-service/). Each Commendation of Service (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/54637/commendation-of-service/) costs 1 mark and rewards you with 185 Honor.<br>
All the items bought with marks had their price changed and can now be bought with honor only.<br>
If you&apos;re interested in the old PvP rewards (some of them looked pretty nice), their price was also changed and it will be much easier to get them. Expect to spend 25,000 honor for a 2H weapon and 13,000 for a 1H. A full pre-BC epic PvP set will cost you 74,000 Honor. <br>
<br>
Of course some of the price changes are more interesting than the others, for example you don&apos;t have to farm marks anymore to get your PvP mounts and you can just buy them for 50,000 Honor. <br>

<br>
Just as a reminder, this is the PvP part of the Patch 3.3.3 PTR Notes (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=23329393385&amp;sid=1), just in case you want to hear it from the blues. <br>
<br>
PvP<br>
The amount of Honor awarded for an Honorable Kill has been increased by 100% for characters of all levels. This change will effectively double the amount of Honor received from Honorable Kills, or for completing Battleground and Wintergrasp objectives; however, the amount of experience gained from completing Battleground objectives and the amount of Honor rewarded for completing each Wintergrasp quest remain unchanged.<br>
<br>
Battlegrounds<br>
<br>
&lt;ul&gt; The Random Battleground system has been added! Similar to the Random Dungeon system in the Dungeon Finder, players can now queue for a random Battleground.&lt;ul&gt; The Random Battleground option can be found in the Battleground tab of the PvP frame and is only available for level 80 characters at this time. If this option is selected, players may not queue for specific Battlegrounds and a random Battleground simultaneously. Similar to the Random Dungeon system, players will not know for which Battleground they are chosen when selected from the queue until they zone into the Battleground. The Random Battleground option will only allow a group size of 5 players to queue together. Bonus rewards will be offered for choosing the Random Battleground option. Winning a Battleground using the Random Battleground option for the first time in a day will award players with 30 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency and 25 Arena points. Winning additional Battlegrounds using the Random Battleground option after the first random win will award players with 15 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency. Losing a Battleground using the Random Battleground option will award players with 5 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.[/list] Daily Battleground quests have been removed in place of the Random Battleground option. Battlegrounds will no longer award Marks of Honor.&lt;ul&gt; Players with existing Marks of Honor can still turn them in to their respective faction&apos;s quest givers, including individual marks for those who may have more marks for one Battleground than another. Items which previously required Marks of Honor will have their costs adjusted to remove these requirements.[/list] Whenever a Battleground has the holiday bonus active, it will now be referred to as &quot;Call to Arms&quot; in the Battleground tab and Calendar. In addition, Call to Arms Battleground Honor rewards have been changed.&lt;ul&gt; Choosing a specific Battleground with the Call to Arms bonus active will yield the exact same rewards as when choosing the Random Battleground option.&lt;ul&gt; Winning a Call to Arms Battleground for the first time in a day will award players with 30 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency and 25 Arena points. Additional Call to Arms Battleground victories after the first win for a player that day will award them with 15 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency. Losing a Call to Arms Battleground will award players with 5 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency. When using the Random Battleground option, players will not receive additional rewards if the Battleground chosen is under the Call to Arms bonuses. In addition, the rewards for the first victory of the day cannot be earned more than once, regardless of whether or not it is obtained from the Random Battleground system or the Call to Arms Battleground.[/list][/list][/list]<br>

Mobile Authenticator Warning Message<br>
After installing the most recent Battle.net Mobile Authenticator iPhone/iPod touch update (v1.1.0), all players will be prompted with a one-time warning that states:<br>
Running a &#x201C;jailbroken&#x201D; iPhone OS device may compromise the security of the Battle.net Mobile Authenticator.<br>
<br>
This warning message is being issued by Blizzard Entertainment as a reminder that running the Battle.net Mobile Authenticator on a &#x201C;jailbroken&#x201D; iPhone or iPod touch could potentially compromise the security of the Mobile Authenticator application. If your iPhone or iPod touch has not been &#x201C;jailbroken&#x201D; or modified to bypass software restrictions, please click &#x201C;OK&#x201D; and you will no longer receive the warning.<br>
<br>
Please note that this message will appear on all iPhone &amp; iPod touch devices and is not meant to indicate that your Apple device has been modified. <br>
<br>
Dodge and Parry<br>
I think the way you end up with conclusions like this is by following a chain of logic such as:<br>
<br>
1) I am a tank. It is my job to survive (among other things).<br>
2) It makes it easier to survive if I avoid spike damage and otherwise make it easier on my healers.<br>
3) I can avoid spike damage by emphasizing health and armor over avoidance.<br>
4) Therefore I should look for health and armor wherever possible.<br>
5) Since I don&apos;t really want avoidance, Blizzard should stop putting it on my gear or even in the game.<br>
<br>
That last step is where you go astray. You make a leap from thinking like a player (&quot;How can I survive better?&quot;) to designing like a player (&quot;I can survive better if Blizzard changes the game to make it easier for me to survive better&quot;).<br>
<br>
You&apos;d be bored if there was no avoidance mechanic in combat. Bosses would hit you like a metronome for say 30K every swing. You&apos;d be bored if there was no avoidance on gear because you&apos;d only be choosing among say hit and expertise and maybe armor pen.<br>
<br>
Random numbers are an important component for keeping the game exciting. I get that they can be a thorn in your side. That&apos;s largely why they are exciting. Without them, you&apos;d be a better tank, but you&apos;d also be a bored tank.<br>
<br>
What we can do, and what we plan on doing, are making dodge, parry and block more attractive than they are today. I doubt they will ever be as attractive as armor and Stamina, but that&apos;s okay because we&apos;re never going to make a full set of gear that is just armor and Stamina. (And even if you assembled such a set, your healers would run out of mana trying to keep you up.) <br>
<br>
Relics and &quot;useless&quot; procs<br>
We actually don&apos;t like procs that are up 100% of the time and in 3.3.3 we changed several of the group buffs to just be passives.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the mechanic is necessary so that a damage rotation requires some ramp-up instead of just being at 100% from the first swing. So we can&apos;t get rid of every single case.<br>
<br>
The idols (and all similar pieces) are in a weird spot. Once upon a time they used to change your rotation ad little bit in order to maximize the bonus, but these days they are really balanced around being up 100% of the time and if we end up putting the proc on a spell or ability that isn&apos;t used often, well then the idol just sucks for that tier.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re not sure yet what we&apos;re going to do with these items. The current implementation doesn&apos;t feel that successful. They could just be stat sticks not tied to a particular ability, though that&apos;s not super exciting either.
