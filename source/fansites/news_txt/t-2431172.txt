[With weekly maintenance in each region] The strength of Vantus Runes has been reduced to the same potency they had in Legion.

Developers’ notes: Vantus runes are a unique consumable that provide an extra boost when your raid group is focusing on a single boss. But if they’re too powerful, they can create a sense of regression as you try to re-kill the boss without their aid in subsequent weeks.




Quests

Fixed a bug where Pa’ku could fail to appear as expected during “Zandalar Forever! ”.
Collecting Incandescent Duskwings or Crown of Torcali in a group now shares credit on “Alchemy is an Inexact Science ”.
