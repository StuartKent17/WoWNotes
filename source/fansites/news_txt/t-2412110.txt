Patch 8.0.1 - Mythic+ Cache and Wakening Essence
Everyone got 1000 x Wakening Essence  in the Mythic Cache this week, even if you didn't do any dungeons! That's enough to buy a Purified Titan Essence 
The changes we're making to the Mythic+ system for Battle for Azeroth will prevent you from receiving your normal Mythic Cache this week. As this was unintentional, your cache will include 1000 Wakening Essence and a Keystone instead of your normal rewards.

If you have a problem looting the Mythic Cache, you'll receive the Keystone in the mail and the Wakening Essences will be granted after you log back in.

We apologize for the inconvenience!


Just a heads up but we're working on a hotfix to add the BoA legendary tokens back to the vendor. We don't have an ETA on this but we're working on it!
