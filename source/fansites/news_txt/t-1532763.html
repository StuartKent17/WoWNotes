Warlords of Draenor - Orc Clan Armor Sets<br>
Today we are taking a look at another of the Orc Clan armor sets, the Thunderlord and Frostwolf Clans. These sets are currently not available to players.<br>

No instant starsurge affects DPS on the move alot.Most moonkins use starsurge instant cast procs as a 1 second time of movement<br>
We decided to go with trying Instant Starsurges. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473323667594555392))<br>
<br>
Will Moonkin be able to show their armor or are we destined to always be owl beast models from duskwood no matter the gear? <br>
Did you miss Glyph of Stars? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473325592813645825))<br>
<br>
Sine-wave is very forgiving to timing. The bonus damage is minute due to it. And it&apos;s very, very easy to learn&amp;master.<br>
FYI, based on testing, we&apos;re going to try a 40sec long cycle (still 20sec with Euphoria). DoT base duration raised to 20sec too. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473493727437012992))<br>
It also pauses at the ends now (most of the added time).Nerdy details: Now a sine wave between -110 and 110, capped at -100/100 (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473494231097438208))<br>
This change makes it less stressful, not really less skillful. Skill is still strong. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473538341799878656))<br>
Starsurge and Astral Communion usage are the biggest high end skill differentiators now. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473538647732400128))<br>
DoT uptime and Wrath/Starfire are solid core mechanics to master. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473538875294351362))<br>

Would u consider cutting two seconds off freezing trap and scatter so they can coexist in WoD? Scatter is ideal for landing traps.<br>
We&apos;ll see how the change works out in testing. There is a benefit of getting rid of an instant CC button. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473532110263709697))<br>

will the base damage increase to tanks be enough to make leveling as prot viable?<br>
Absolutely. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473255954171953152))<br>
<br>

Doesn&apos;t that mean in effect, that Devouring Plague still technically snapshots?<br>
Yes, for [6/Haste] sec. Little snapshots like that are fine. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473493234522390529))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
Hey, Will we ever see new weapons with cool &apos;equip&apos; or &apos;chance on hit&apos; effects like the ones from DS?<br>
Potentially. We try to mix it up. Some tiers we go a little more crazy with trinkets, sometimes weapons, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472265388248403968))<br>
<br>
not sure what the state of tier bonuses is in WOD, but will Mythic tier have the same bonuses as Normal/Heroic tier?<br>
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472311311997489153))<br>
<br>
Achievements<br>
Herald of the Titans achieve/title still going to be available in WoD?<br>
Should be, yes. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/472258367671791617))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Will garrisons have any PvP aspects/benefits/gameplay involved? Thanks!<br>
still discussing (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/472349389923434496))<br>
<br>
Wtf Heart of the Valorous? How about Honorable Heart or Hear of the Conqueror for a bit? (C&apos;mon you knew it was coming)<br>
Valor and Conquest serve very different purposes. Valor doesn&apos;t give you gear. Conquest does. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/472425747999490048))<br>
There are already tremendous catch-up mechanics in place for PvP: rating inflation and catch-up cap. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/472425881441284096))<br>
<br>
One of the issue&apos;s with Ret in PvP atm is that Templar&apos;s Verdict is too weak as a finisher. Outside of major cd&apos;s Ret is no threat.<br>
&quot;Outside of cooldowns I&apos;m not threat&quot; is a complaint we here from every spec with cooldowns. It&apos;s why we&apos;re removing many of them. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/472790124283957249))<br>
<br>
Just wondering if you guys have put any thought into scaling gear up in pvp (bgs) before WoD?<br>
No there is tech involved to do this that&apos;s coming in Warlords. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/472793339230572545))<br>
<br>
Will PvP set bonuses change as we change spec in WoD?<br>
yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473539416141873153))<br>
<br>
is chaos bolt damage reduced by 25% against player?<br>
Yes it&apos;s damage is reduced against players in Mists. Possibly not in Warlords. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473530994188771328))<br>
In WOD pvp crit reduction means CB does 25% less against players anyway, doesn&apos;t it?<br>
yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473539469279522816))<br>
Dont you think crit and other stats should be downscaled in PVE too? To have the same rules for PVE and PVP?<br>
Crits are awesome so you can say &quot;woah HUGE number&quot; but gameplay dictates different magnitudes in two modes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473560070396313600))<br>
<br>
could we see some news on Ashran soon? Would love to see some more in-depth discussion about the &quot;Ashran Only&quot; weapons.<br>
We&apos;re getting to a point where we think we&apos;ll have a lot more to share soon. But we&apos;re early on in that process. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473576727235407873))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
Out of curiosity, will our friends in the farm become followers in our garrison?<br>
The Panda farm? They don&apos;t... really want to go through that portal. Best to stay near a brewery. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/472222928923156480))<br>
