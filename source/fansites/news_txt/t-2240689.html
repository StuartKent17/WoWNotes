Good news, adventurers! We&#x2019;re excited to announce that this year, BlizzCon is expanding into a brand-new hall in the Anaheim Convention Center&#x2026;which means we now have some more tickets available for BlizzCon 2017.<br>
<br>
If you didn&#x2019;t get a ticket in the first two sales, get ready for another shot! Our third set of BlizzCon tickets will go on sale:<br>
<br>
Wednesday, July 5 at 7:00 p.m. PT<br>
<br>
This third ticket sale will once again be hosted by Universe.com, and tickets are priced at $199 each (plus applicable taxes and fees). This sale will work just like our previous two, but if you&#x2019;d like more info, check out the BlizzCon Ticket page (http://blizz.ly/1qpfPCi) and Badge Information page (http://blizz.ly/1qt4jFB) for all the details.<br>
<br>
Blizzard Entertainment&#x2019;s two-day gaming convention and community celebration returns to the Anaheim Convention Center on November 3 and 4 for a weekend full of hands-on gaming, in-depth developer panels, incredible esports competition, and more.<br>
<br>
Virtual Ticket &#x2013; Coming Soon!<br>
If you can&#x2019;t make it to the show in person, you&#x2019;ll still have a chance to join the celebration from home with the BlizzCon Virtual Ticket, which will provide live streaming coverage to viewers around the world. Stay tuned for more details.<br>
<br>
Check out the BlizzCon Event Info page (http://blizz.ly/1XZJUGE) for lots more information on prepping for the show and the upcoming ticket sales.<br>
<br>
Look for more information on the events and activities at BlizzCon as the show approaches. We&#x2019;ll see you in November!<br>
<br>
Q&amp;A:<br>
<br>
Q: Why are more tickets on sale?<br>
A: Until recently, we weren&#x2019;t sure if the new hall at the Anaheim Convention Center would be ready in time for BlizzCon. Once we confirmed it would be, we worked quickly to determine how we&#x2019;d use the space and how many more people we could accommodate while preserving the awesomeness of the BlizzCon experience.<br>
<br>
Q: Why don&#x2019;t you sell even more tickets? More people can fit in the convention center, right?<br>
A: We truly want everyone to have a great time at BlizzCon, and part of that is making sure we strike the right balance between the content&#x2014;our stages, events, demos, and so on&#x2014;and the number of live attendees. Having too many people packed into the convention center would detract from the experience of being able to mingle with newfound friends and catch all the panels and esports events that you&#x2019;d like. We&#x2019;re excited that we&#x2019;ll have access to a new hall, and we&#x2019;re looking forward to making BlizzCon an unforgettable experience for everyone who attends.<br>
