Character / Items<br>
This expansion made inventory management worse. Toy box was one step forward and all the new stuff 5 steps back.<br>
What new stuff are you having trouble fitting? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/546044237452546048))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
had a SoO lockout which I joined mid run, cleared to Garrosh. after leaving it said the first 3 bosses were available + Garrosh. few weeks later, extending the lockout, I kill Immerseus and now I have a lockout with only Immerseus dead. I suppose it has to do with lockouts being nothing more than loot locks nowadays, either way I think choosing to extend should mean you are deliberately choosing to get loot locked to these bosses you don&apos;t want to re-kill.<br>
Agreed - I think we have some work to do there to clean up the system. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/545978371474083840))<br>
<br>
Lore<br>
big lore moment in highmaul with cho&apos;gall restricted to mythic only. feel annoyed by this, shouldn&apos;t better items be enough?<br>
Not sure it qualifies as a &apos;big lore moment.&apos; It&apos;s a neat fight, though! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/546020149229146112))<br>
<br>
Out of curiosity, how common is it for a Draenei to be named Exarch? Just did the quest chain with Yrel and found it interesting!<br>
At this time in Draenor there were exactly five Exarchs, &quot;The Hand of the Prophet.&quot; At least, they start with five... (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/546020766936883200))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
What ever happened to, followers would get a rare mission to run old raids to sometimes bring back transmog gear?<br>
Felt strange having them run old raids when they&apos;re supposed to be defending Draenor. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/545753136481062912))<br>
<br>
With the legendary follower. Is it a character that we already know of or is it an entirely new character?<br>
I&apos;m not sure that a brand new character would feel legendary to people. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/545758419135655936))<br>
<br>
I&apos;m really surprised our Garrisons didn&apos;t get decorated for the holidays.<br>
Def. would have been nice to have, it was on our wishlist to let you choose the holiday decoration set any time of year. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/546043560739364864))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
also I get the feeling that after @WarcraftDevs showed up you guys just don&apos;t talk anymore, which is sad <br>
With the release of WoD, there&apos;s a bit less to discuss atm I am thinking of making a crock pot of spiced cider. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/546043981432246272))<br>
