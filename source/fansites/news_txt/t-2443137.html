Every BlizzCon, we&#x2019;ve closed out the weekend with a musical performance&#x2014;but this year, we won&#x2019;t just have one live band; instead, three diverse musical acts will perform live in our own BlizzCon mini music festival featuring Train, Kristian Nairn, and Lindsey Stirling!<br>
<br>
The closing festivities will begin around 7:30 p.m. with a sendoff from Blizzard. Then the music begins around 8:00 p.m. PDT with Train on the Mythic stage. Kristian Nairn and Lindsey Stirling will follow shortly thereafter in the Overwatch Arena and at the Heroes of the Storm Tournament stage, respectively. The start times for each act are staggered to help ensure you have a chance to see some of each; walk the halls with your friends and fellow Blizzard gamers to enjoy all the festivities!<br>
