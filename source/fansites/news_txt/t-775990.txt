Boubouille2010-10-17, 08:00 AMTier 11 - Models Preview
It's time for one last model preview of Tier 11 models, I have most of the sets fixed now and most of them should be very close to what you will have on live servers. 


There are a few bugs with missing textures on male models, I'll have to wait for Blizzard to fix that.
Some of the models for gloves/boots might be wrong but ... well, it's barely noticeable and I probably got most of them right.
I added the missing belts on most sets. Sets are still 5 pieces, we're just talking about non-set with matching skins here
All the effects on sets are fixed. 
Yes, the multi race screenshots / videos for each set / super awesome preview will be available very soon.
