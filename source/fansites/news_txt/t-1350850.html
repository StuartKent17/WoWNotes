Siege of Orgrimmar Heroic Progression<br>
Method (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/twisting-nether/Method/rating.tier16_25) is leading progress with 13/14 bosses down now, followed by seven other guilds at 12/14. Over in the 10 player column, Paragon (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/lightning-s-blade/Paragon/rating.tier16_10) has managed to kill Paragons, so they are currently leading with 13/14 bosses down.<br>

Change to Rated Battleground Queuing<br>
We&#x2019;re in the process of applying a hotfix that will restrict a player&#x2019;s ability to queue for a Rated Battleground if they&#x2019;ve left one prematurely, until the previous Battleground is completed. Once the hotfix is active, should you find yourself unable to queue for a Rated Battleground immediately after leaving one in progress, you&#x2019;ll simply need to wait until it has finished and will then be able to queue once again.<br>

Raid Finder Difficulty<br>
We&apos;re not really seeing a big dramatic shift in completion/failure rates for the first weeks of LFR runs with Flex now in the picture vs. previous tiers, so I think the guesses that Flex is stealing all the good players are probably a bit premature. Probably. But as I said here, we&apos;re excited so many people seem to be enjoying Flex, it&apos;s going to be preferable to a lot of people over LFR, and of course that&apos;s going to have some kind of impact, but it&apos;s just too early to know to what extent.<br>
<br>
You clearly have not reviewed the data from wing 2. It&apos;s about on par with how ridiculous HOF part 2 was, which you had to nerf.<br>
No, we have. Adjustments are quite possible, we already have some LFR Nazgrim tweaks in the works, but we&apos;re seeing very reasonable wipe/completion rates on second wing SoO bosses. We&apos;re keeping a close eye on things.<br>
<br>
5hr lfr and 20 wipes for the entire LFR is reasonable?<br>
Obviously you&apos;ll get in groups that have some trouble, and sometimes you&apos;ll get in a group that one-shots everything. Individual group to group success rates aren&apos;t going to be consistent while people are still learning the fights. But when I refer to overall wipe/success rates I&apos;m referring to overall averages for all LFR groups for all realms of multiple regions.

<br>
Raid Finder Difficulty<br>
It&apos;s too early to say how the interaction will fully play out between Flex and LFR, but I think it&apos;s reasonable to expect that a lot of people will prefer Flex because of its similarities with LFR (as a quick and low pressure way to raid), but without the things they don&apos;t like about LFR (Flex requiring a curated and managed group experience) for better rewards, achievements, and mounts, and with friends and guildies if possible. If that&apos;s the case, the core LFR audience changes, their reason for doing LFR changes, and it&apos;s potentially a world where LFR adapts to fit a more niche role, which could mean changes for challenge and reward to better fit the audience&apos;s intended use of it. All speculation of course, but we&apos;re certainly watching.

&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/march/hearthstoneIcon.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom:-2px; margin-right:0px; vertical-align:bottom&quot; /&gt; Hearthstone Update - Account Wipe Incoming<br>
Hello Hearthstone players (and members of our gracious community still trying to get into the beta)!<br>
<br>
Thank you for stopping by to read this important closed beta test update. At the start of the beta, we mentioned that we would reset information at some point, wiping all progress and cards in the process. We built this into our plan as we knew going into the beta that a number of cards were likely to emerge as overpowered and we also knew that we&#x2018;d make significant adjustments to the reward system and overall game progression. So, as part of the effort to level the playing field and also prepare our players&#x2019; accounts for the release version of our progression system, we made the decision to schedule a one-time wipe of all beta participant accounts. We have just about reached the point in closed beta where we&#x2019;ll be doing this wipe, and thus wanted to share what that will mean for you, what to expect on the day of the wipe, and what will happen immediately afterwards.<br>
<br>
A wipe? What&#x2019;s a wipe?<br>
If you are participating in the Hearthstone closed beta test, your progress will be reset. This includes your gold, experience and class levels gained through play, arcane dust quantities, cards unlocked through progression, and your medal ranking in Ranked Play mode. When you load up the game afterwards, it will be as if you were starting in Hearthstone as a new player. You&#x2019;ll have to play the introductory missions once more and show Illidan just how prepared he is! (Spoilers: He&#x2019;s not.)<br>
<br>
When is the wipe happening?<br>
We&#x2019;re getting ready to release a pretty major beta patch to Hearthstone, and the wipe will coincide with that patch so we can closely monitor testing with the implemented updates.<br>
<br>
A patch! What&#x2019;s in the patch!?<br>
We&#x2019;ll announce details of the patch in a separate blog, so stay tuned!<br>
<br>
I spent real money in Hearthstone! Is that going away!?<br>
No way! As we mentioned in the earlier blog (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/blog/10639928/hearthstone-closed-beta-test-begins-8-16-2013), any money you spent in Hearthstone will be reimbursed as gold, so you will be able to repurchase the same number of packs and Arena tickets you bought previously without additional investment. For each card pack purchased with real money, you&#x2019;ll get back 100 gold. Each Arena entry will get you back 150 gold. Please note that any packs you purchase after the wipe will be different than the ones you had previously, so it is unlikely that you will receive the same cards again.<br>
<br>
A couple examples:<br>
<br>
Tim bought the $2.99 bundle for 2 packs during the beta. After the wipe, he will receive 200 gold (100 gold per pack x 2 packs.)<br>
Janet bought the $49.99 bundle for 40 packs during the beta. She also bought 3 Arena entries. Janet will receive 4450 gold (100 gold x 40 packs + 150 gold X 3 Arena runs) after the wipe has been completed. <br>
<br>
<br>
Like all gold, the reimbursed gold credit can be spent on either packs or Arena tickets. So if you bought a pack bundle previously, and would prefer to use your gold credit towards Arena entry, that&#x2019;s available as an option.<br>
<br>
Did you know: Getting back a lot of gold and need to buy a lot of packs at the same time? You can buy mass quantities of packs with gold by double-clicking on the brown &#x201C;1 Pack&#x201D; button in the store!<br>
<br>
I helped test the store and got a Golden Gelbin Mekkatorque card! Is he wiped too?<br>
Your good friend Gelbin will be waiting for you as soon as you complete the Illidan introductory mission. As soon as you&#x2019;ve completed that mission you will receive the &#x201C;Beta Hero&#x201D; quest reward which will grant you Gelbin, as well as the gold credit for any purchases made prior to the wipe.<br>
<br>
Will there be any wipes in the future?<br>
We don&#x2019;t anticipate any further wipes. This goes for both the Hearthstone beta and after the game&#x2019;s official release. Any progress made during the beta after the wipe will be retained through the release of Hearthstone, such as new cards you obtain, levels that you gain and ranks you achieve. Basically, you&#x2019;ll now be able to keep your stuff.<br>
<br>
Wait, how will this work for Korea, Taiwan, and China? Closed beta hasn&#x2019;t even started there yet!<br>
Korea, Taiwan, and China will not be wiped. The wipe only applies to the beta participants currently playing in the North American and European beta tests.<br>
