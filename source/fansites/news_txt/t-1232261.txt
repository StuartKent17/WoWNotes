chaud2012-11-30, 05:22 PMBlizzard Registers Project Blackstone Domain
Fusible  noticed that ProjectBlackstone.com was recently purchased by Blizzard Entertainment. It doesn't mean much yet but the choice of domain name could point to a side project for Diablo 3 or even pet battles They also appear to have purchased WarcraftBattles.com  last month.

We're mostly reporting this to have a nice point of discussion for it, but nothing really points to it being a major project = probably not anything Titan related.
