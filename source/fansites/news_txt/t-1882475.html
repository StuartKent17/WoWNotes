Battle.Net Voice Chat<br>
It looks like Voice Chat might be coming to Battle.Net. An upcoming Battle.Net Client build has references to Vivox (http://www.vivox.com/gaming-solutions/integrated-voice.html), a company that produces voice chat for games. It is in use already in Eve, World of Tanks, The Elder Scrolls Online, H1Z1, Star Trek Online, Second Life, and many other games. As always, this is just a possibility and nothing is guaranteed! Sometimes features are planned (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/236761-appear-offline-option-coming-soon-to-battlenet/) but just don&apos;t work out.<br>

Poll - Voice Chat<br>
Assuming it works as well as it does in the other games that already have integrated it, would you use Battle.Net voice chat? <br>
