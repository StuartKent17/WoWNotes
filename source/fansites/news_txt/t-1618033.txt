Behind the Scenes of Lords of War...
The road to The Dark Portal is paved with good intentions http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090711231308/wowwiki/images/5/55/Path_of_Glory_-_Close-up.jpg.

I wasn't implying the Iron Horde was responsible for the Path of Glory in Outland, but rather the Iron Horde's intentions as far as they're concerned aren't "evil"; their redemption is just misguided. The clans of the Iron Horde have been beaten down, oppressed, tortured, and marginalized, and one day a slick orc walks in with amazing technology and great power, telling them of a glorious future where they take back their honor and rule as conquerors of an entire planet. As repugnant as their actions ultimately are, those aren't intentions fueled purely by some ultimate evil. Which to me makes them far more interesting from a story perspective. Don't be fooled, these guys are bad, but not in the strict sense of the word. They have motivations, and intentions, and those are shaped by their experiences. Enemies that aren't just brainlessly evil is pretty cool, if not uncomfortably realistic.

The Iron Horde have been set down a very dark path, and there's no sign of them veering from it. To make the wrongs against them right, they will pave a road with the bones of whoever oppose them, demon blood or not.

Classes
Since Warriors kinda underwhelming visually attack side, glyph to make Whirlwind all fiery and such? Fits with theme, I'd say.
We don't disagree, it's a hot topic of discussion, many classic wow classes could use a visual overhaul. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524967539923619840

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock / Skills http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warlock / Talent Calculator http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#k
any plans on buffing Warlock? After the last "hotfix" they are at the bottom dps at 100 with all specs.
We'll adjust tuning as necessary at 100. We did a pass at 90 because it was too significantly off to leave for a month. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/524415598957064193

Art
So I got excited about garrisons enchant transmoging but then realised I'm a hunter.. any solution?
Not immediately, but it's on our radar for sure. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524654316359917569

PvE
What changes besides dmg squish was Spine of Deathwing supposed to get that would make it easier to solo? They already in?
He takes twice as long to roll if you are solo. Much easier to dance back and forth. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/524634458154991617

PvP
for example, i queue with friend in skirmish. he leaves arena, i have to leave arena to requeue with him.
The functionality of the button is to queue people still in the arena. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/524590695257239553

with a 50% win rate, doesn't 200-250 skirmishes seem a bit much for one piece of gear? With healers, the games can be real long.
You get more honor if the game goes longer. But longer games are still less efficient. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/524595390143021056

Can you confirm if there will be an honor wipe with Wod coming out?
We don't plan on wiping honor. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/524595444757061633

Is there an official start date for season 16 warlords season1? Wondering if I can get conquest gear before raids unlock.
Season starts the same day raids open holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/524701493950025729

Lore
I think the plague is slightly hidden and too small to be seen, put some flowers and weapons around it!
Nazgrim's axe maybe? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524653648047898624

Will we be seeing Sky Admiral Rogers again in a later patch? She is awesome.
We like her and want to use her again. No word on when or where. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/524706791527944192

World
Why do those weather stones need the limited charges? Going back to the isle to grind ain't fun.
Things that affect how others see the world are often limited to preserve the world Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524656984587374592

Will the alliance get more candy buckets next year since they have 5 less than the horde now? Need more candy next year.
Will investigate, thanks! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/525012985383628800

Garrisons
Thanks ! So can those Leatherworking tents be used on old continents and will there be new faction tents coming?
The time limit is relatively short because they are fairly large and obstructive. We'll look into a use-anywhere one. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524655839437537280

Garrison enhancement suggestion: An actual toy box that becomes more impressive as you fill it with more toys. 
Might be cool to let you summon it as a toy anywhere, and ppl can click on it to get a random toy effect? Will consider. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524656201166888960

Are nameable garrison followers still a possibility for a WoD patch? My sister had lists of names ready, haha.
Unfortunately, no, they have pretty extensive backstories and it would be weird to be able to force re-name them Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524656377604489216

There doesn't seem to be any difference between doing a mission with 600ilvl follower or 650. Intended?
You should see an increase in the change to obtain loot from that mission, are you not seeing that? The bonus loot % Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524657702853545984
