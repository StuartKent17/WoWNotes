Warcraft Movie PAX East Panel<br>
Duncan Jones and Robert Kazinsky were at PAX east to talk about the Warcraft movie. They also had a short segment on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/WarcraftMovie/videos/639360389562923/) afterwards.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kazinsky played Alliance for a long time, but switched to Horde once he started raiding hardcore. <br>
Ben Foster was interested in spell casting and the team came up with a visual and audio language for spell casting. He was really committed to getting all of the details right. <br>
There was a month long Orc camp where the actors learned how to move like seven foot tall six-hundred pound Orcs. <br>
The team went to ILM for visual effects early on, meeting with Jeff White (http://www.ilm.com/people/jeff-white/). He had moved the technology forward for the Hulk in the first Avengers movie and is a big Warcraft fan that was excited to do the movie.<br>
It took several weeks after shooting to get the first Orgrim shot with effects. Up until then the team was very nervous about how good the Orcs would look. <br>
After the team saw the first shot with Orcs, they were relieved at how great they looked and did more close up shots.<br>
The team was halfway through filming the movie before they realized Orgrim doesn&apos;t fight much in the movie. The team then just filmed a bunch of fight sequences, including one where Orgrim hits another Orc with the Doomhammer in the stomach, lifts him up above his head, and drops him into his head to knock him out.<br>
The person who came up with the Orc language for the movie is also the person who does languages for Game of Thrones and happens to be a Warcraft player. There are a few key scenes in the movie where the Orc language is used in an interesting way and where fans will recognize some of the phrases. <br>
Ramin Djawadi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramin_Djawadi) did the Game of Thrones theme as well as music in the Warcraft movie. It is different than the Game of Thrones music, incorporating some of the Warcraft game music in some places where it made sense as well as new material. <br>
Fans of Warcraft will feel like they have gone home when they see the movie.<br>
Kazinsky plays an Orc Death Knight, he has been researching for his role for years! He didn&apos;t have to correct people on set about how the Warcraft universe worked, as everyone working on the movie did a great job. <br>
Motion capture is now good enough to show all of Orgrim&apos;s emotion. <br>
Clancy Brown rides a frostwolf in the movie. During filming he rode up on a little blue rocking horse, pulled by three crew members and that scene took a long time to film because of how funny it looked without effects. <br>
When Duncan Jones heard that the previous director had moved on, he asked to read the script. He recognized that Human heroes vs Orc villains was not the right way to do the movie. He pitched his idea to Legendary and then to Blizzard, showing heroes on both sides, half Human and half Orc.<br>
The audience spends a good amount of time with the Orcs, so he had to use CGI rather than latex prosthetics. To offset all of the character CGI, lots of real sets were used. <br>
In the movie Orgrim has the Doomhammer and uses it as a hammer as a Warrior, so there is a little bit of bending of how the game works.<br>
If this movie does well and Duncan Jones gets to do a sequel, he will be able to put Tauren in it. After that he could do Illidan, Arthas, and all of the other story if the movies do well. <br>
No matter when you started playing Warcraft, or even if you haven&apos;t, everyone will be able to enjoy the movie.<br>
There are moments where the movie differs from the lore in smaller ways to make it a better movie. <br>
Duncan Jones tried to fit in extra material and easter eggs that would fill out the Warcraft experience for fans in a way that wouldn&apos;t distract from the story. <br>
The team worked with Wei Wang (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Wei_Wang) to do art for the movie. <br>
There are only a few scenes in the movie where the Orcs and Humans are in the same scene. <br>

World Quest Difficulty<br>
While this will change over the course of the expansion pack as you gain power, the tuning values we&apos;re currently shooting for are:<br>
<br>
Normal World Quests: 1+ player(s)<br>
Rare World Quests (blue, no dragon): 2-3+ player(s) <br>
Rare Elite World Quests (blue, dragon): 3-5+ player(s) <br>
Epic Elite World Quests (purple, dragon): 5-10+ player(s) <br>
<br>
Some content will be easier or harder within each difficulty band, this is intended. We would like the outdoor endgame to have challenge peaks and valleys.

Order Hall Upgrade - Instant World Quest Completion<br>
I&quot;m trying to be supportive, I really am.<br>
<br>
But looking at this image from MMO showing Order Hall upgrades with an option to &quot;instantly complete&quot; a world quest just blows my mind.<br>
<br>
Wasn&apos;t this one of the biggest problems with Garrisons? Sending followers out to do things while we just clicked a garrison mission table?<br>
<br>
How is this different? Why do we need &quot;instant completion&quot; of content that is designed for us to actually egage in? Don&apos;t you see that you are neutralizing your own content again and removing the need to go out into the world and complete things?<br>
Currently this ability only works on a small amount of World Quests - those akin to a daily quest. Does not work on dungeons, rare elites, bosses, etc. <br>
<br>
With that in mind, continued feedback is welcome! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/409302-cmon-blizz-are-we-doing-this-again/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743384500?page=1#7))<br>

World Quests<br>
Will reason be provided as to why our characters will do them? Like, how do they know things are going on on the map?<br>
Quest text will be given to you via a Talking Head when you start/finish the quest, and are tied to the zone&apos;s quest story. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720355651394805763))<br>
<br>
will the World Quests involve filling up bars, or will they have actual objectives?<br>
Both, more the latter than the former as bars tend to not tell as interesting stories as doing individual things. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720371821661462528))<br>
<br>
Order Halls<br>
Jeremy, you&apos;re one of the few communicators so I&apos;m reaching out. This Legion mission table scares me, despite Ion&apos;s comments.<br>
it&apos;s definitely one of those things that could be super contentious/not fun, we think it&apos;s improved, please give us feedback! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/719947952337264640))<br>

PvE<br>
M Nythendra thread is clustered, but can you maybe change the colors of the rot pulls? Blend in a bit too well.<br>
Thanks - &quot;red-on-red-on-red&quot; concerns are definitely something that&apos;s on the radar. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/719646784469905409))<br>
<br>
Have you seen this thread? Some wonderful affix ideas here! https://t.co/NccZXrftIf<br>
I have! Fun thread. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/719905612872572928))<br>
<br>
The Broken Shore in the Alpha will require 20 people correct? Since it was announced 20/20. <br>
1-20 (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720365007477673985))<br>
<br>
Is Broken Shore part of the pre-patch/event or is it the Tanaan Intro type for whenever 7.0 launches?<br>
Both. During pre-launch, it kicks off the Legion invasions. Post-launch, it sets the story for heading to new Dalaran. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720372366870601728))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Oh, and World PvP objectives are a part of World Quests? YESSS, love it. Just hope it won&apos;t be queued or phased.<br>
.Most of them are open FFA arenas, sometimes involving riding a goat. Embrace the world PvP! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720353265141985280))<br>
For those of us who hate PvP more than GC hated Paladins, I assume the PvP objectives are fully optional?<br>
Both PvEvP (PvE that flags you) and full PvP objectives will be available. Both grant honor. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720355915250020352))<br>
(PvE that flags you) if it flags us for pvp it isnt a PVE objective.is it?<br>
This is an attempt at &quot;PvEvP,&quot; similar to assaulting an NPC-controlled Wintergrasp tower. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720371061318004736))<br>
We will be monitoring feedback closely! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720371148324605952))<br>
<br>
Reputation<br>
That&apos;s not my question. Can I complete all reputation besides the inevitable PvP one with just pure PvE quests?<br>
Yes (there is currently no PvP reputation). (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720357269938896896))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Hey Greg, love your work. What do you think of the Vanilla wow server shutdown? <br>
I feel bad for players who lost something, but I have faith in Blizzard&apos;s judgment too. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/720788644403945472))<br>
