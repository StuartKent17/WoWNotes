Unique Challenge Mode Gear Effects<br>
You can find in game videos of all of the sets (except for Monk) on our Challenge Mode Armor Sets page (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/932-Challenge-Mode-Armor-Sets).<br>
Challenge Modes are a new feature in Mists of Pandaria that allows coordinated 5-player groups to jump into Heroic dungeons and attempt to set time-trial records. These blindingly fast times are displayed for all to see, but if being famous on the interwebz wasn&apos;t enough, the groups who can achieve gold medals are also awarded with unique gear looks for use in Transmogrification-with a twist. These gear sets behave like nothing you&apos;ve seen in the game before, activating and reacting to their wearer&apos;s combat actions.<br>
<br>
Check out the unique armor effects below-we think you&apos;ll want to grab some friends and give Challenge Modes a shot.<br>

Conquest Point Cap Clarification<br>
There has been some confusion lately regarding how Conquest Points are intended to be capped by the way that they&#x2019;re earned. Conquest Point caps are divided into three categories.<br>
<br>
Rated Battlegrounds &#x2013; The default Conquest Point cap for Rated Battlegrounds is set at 1650, and this can be raised with an increased Rated Battlegrounds rating. This cap is higher by default to reflect the greater challenges presented by organizing and participating in Rated Battlegrounds. Arenas &#x2013; The default Conquest Point cap for Arenas is 1350, and this can be increased by earning a higher Arena Team rating. Random Battlegrounds &#x2013; The default Conquest Point cap for points earned from doing Random Battlegrounds is actually dependent on the other two. It will rise to match whichever of the other two Conquest Point caps is lower. For example: if a player does no Rated Battlegrounds, but has raised their weekly Conquest Point cap to 2000 via a high Arena Team Rating, then the Random Battlegrounds cap will be 1650 to match the cap provided by Rated Battlegrounds.<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s important to note that this is not a recent change. This capping system has been in place since World of Warcraft: Cataclysm patch 4.2. A recent hotfix resolved an issue that allowed players to gain Conquest Points via random Battlegrounds up to the higher of the two point caps, which was not intended.</div></div>
