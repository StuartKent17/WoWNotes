2.3 Arena season 3 : Titles wiping, weapon arts, mount
3 Blue posts about the arena today.
You will lose your old arena titles at the end of Season 2, if you had one during the season 1 but couldn't reach the same level during season 2, bye bye.
Season 3 weapons will have new arts but they won't have new models, they're just recolored raid weapons. 
The Season 2 Armored Netherdrake will have a different color than the one from Season 1.

We plan to use the same titles of Challenger, Rival, Duelist and Gladiator to give to players when season 2 completes. The players with titles from season 1 will have them removed and the titles will be redistributed to the people who win them at the completion of season 2.

They won't be "released" until 2.3 goes up on the PTRs. No sneak peeks for you. I can however tell you that they do in fact have new art. It's different colored raid weapons. So the weapons exist as raid weapons, but they'll have new colors. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2215493544&postId=22153050878&sid=1#2

Yes, it will be a different color Armored Nether Drake. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2215453380&postId=22153050940&sid=1#75

2.3 Warrior changes
Less threat in berserk stance.
Not a lot is finalized right now, but we are currently planning to make Improved Berserker Stance provide threat reduction by 2/4/6/8/10% while in Berserker Stance.

2.3 Druid itemization changes
Two great news for our druids friends, there is a new feral set coming with the Season 3, and attack power on PvE Zul'aman and PvP items will be increased.
We are currently planning to make a Feral-focused set available in season 3. The idea is to make this set have no plus to healing on it and be focused on Feral statistics. Things could still change though. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2215471813&postId=22153051302&sid=1#18

On a related note, for items that grant attack power in Cat, Bear, Dire Bear, and Moonkin forms, in general we are planning to increase the amount of attack power they give. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2215471813&postId=22153051733&sid=1#50

WotLK Neutral Dalaran
Dalaran might be like Shattrath... or not.
It's a bit too early to say if it's going to be like Shattrath. I wouldn't get too upset about it until it's actually designed and we can tell you what it's going to be like. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2215432915&pageNo=1&sid=1#15


I think it's a bit too early to be worried or upset about what is and isn't going to be in Dalaran. When we are further along and have information on it, we'll share it with you all.

In the meantime, remember, Dalaran is filled with the world's most powerful magic users. While they work together, they are also filled with many different personalities and more importantly, have a bit of a crisis on their hands by the name of Malygos. I am going to hazard a guess that the Kirin Tor are going to be using all the available resources they can to survive the onslaught.

2.3 Preparation buff in battlegrounds
If you were afraid about people camping graveyards with the help of the free buff ... buff, well, it seems it will be very short in BGs.
I'm a bit confused about what you are asking. You will only have a very short time after being resurrected by a Spirit Guide to cast any buffs etc for free. After that, it is going to cost you. If the graveyard you are spawning at comes under attack, I guess that means you'll have a little bit of a reprieve to get back into the action. But, if you are an attacker on the graveyard it's not going to have any affect on you.

2.3 Alterac Valley Changes
A short answer about group queues, and a short explanations of the changes.
Q: Group queue?
A: This is something that is in consideration and MAY be tested on the Test Realm. We have some concerns about what this could do to affect the Queue times to get into battle. Currently, the matching system is relatively lenient. Even though it is lenient though, we could end up with longer wait times as a Pre-Made waits to get matched up. At the same time, we are also concerned about what affect this could have on PUGs that find themselves matched up against Pre-Mades. This is another, "let's test and see" sort of thing.

At that point, you need to coordinate with the Raid group to send a group to go retake a graveyard.

A lot of strategies are going to change and people are going to need to decide what locations are essential keys to defeating the opponent. Sometimes you'll have to sacrifice one graveyard to protect a tower. Sometimes, you'll have to leave one target to shore up another.

While it seems like it could be overwhelming right now, I've been in AV many times before and with each change, I've seen people adjust. Those that have been around awhile go into autopilot. They know they need to get to X spot and secure it before going to Y and wiping it out etc. People will adjust to what needs to be done and coordinate or they will lose.

The same goes for losing resources. There are always those kamikaze types of players, but overall, forces will need to learn to not leave people behind, healers will need to keep on top of healing and those that want heals will need to protect their healers. It's one resource per player death currently, you lose far more though if you lose a Tower or a major NPC. Kill the General and it's a guaranteed win. So, what will you do? Just PvP the other side down hoping that you can whittle them down? Or will it be a series of strategic captures that get played out with the end result being the death of the General?

The game display will show the resources that you have so perhaps that will also dictate just how slow and cautiously the game is played or how much sacrificing can be done. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2215433172&postId=22153044726&sid=1#67

New Brewfest mounts next year ?
That's probably the most anticipated news I ever did, but we might get new mounts next year because rams are an alliance mount, and it makes horde roleplayers and alliance players who already own a ram unhappy.
Because it is a Dwarven holiday, and Dwarves? They ride rams. We're not unaware of the community's reaction to this, and you never know what next year might bring.

PTR Fix to your sound problems
I don't know how much it works, but it's probably worth trying if you're experiencing sound problems and don't forget to feedback on the original post if it works. If it doesn't work, it would be a good idea to go on the 2.2.3 PTR and test things !
Re crackle, popping, or other unsteadiness in sound output, try raising the Sound_DSPBufferSize parameter to 8, 9 or 10 the max value. 

/console Sound_DSPBufferSize 10 and then re-launch. See if you notice a difference.
