Update : Fixed, lack of sleep this morning.
Warlocks are getting one of their set changed on the PTR again. This time, it's the Tier 6 2-Parts bonus. 
New Bonus : Each time one of your Corruption or Immolate spells deals periodic damage, you heal 70 health.
Old bonus : Each time one of your Corruption, Curse of Agony, Immolate, or Unstable Affliction spells deals periodic damage, you heal 35 health.


Orc Shoulders
A few people were worried because they couldn't see the orc shoulders changes mentionned in the PTR Patch notes. Don't worry, it's indeed fixed. 
Someone pulled the art from a current build instead of a future one where the shoulder art is fixed. I'll see if they can update it.


I am Murloc
I forgot to mention it yesterday, but if you can't get the "I Am Murloc" video from the Blizzard downloader, I mirrored it on Rapidshare
