Patch 5.1 Darkmoon Faire Updates
The Darkmoon Faire http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/479-darkmoon-faire has started and Patch 5.1 added a few new things. The biggest addition is the new Darkmoon Carousel, which takes the place of one of the large under construction tents. It uses the nice new music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ltaAh-zNY that was added in Patch 5.1. Riding it gives you the WHEE! http://www.wowdb.com/spells/46668-whee buff, which increases reputation and experience gains by 10%. Unlike some of the other event buffs, it does work with quests as well, so it will be useful for leveling reputation. This buff will last for an hour if you ride long enough but does not persist through death, so be careful! 

If you are working on pet battles, the new Darkmoon Pet Battle! http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32175-darkmoon-pet-battle daily quest will let you fight a new pet battle trainer, rewarding you with Darkmoon Pet Supplies http://www.wowdb.com/items/91086-darkmoon-pet-supplies. The bag has contents that are similar to the Sack of Pet Supplies http://www.wowdb.com/items/89125-sack-of-pet-supplies, but has a rare chance of dropping the Darkmoon Eye http://www.wowdb.com/items/91040-darkmoon-eye battle pet. So far we haven't seen one drop out of our small sample, so it is likely the drop rate is similar to the .2% of Porcupette http://www.wowdb.com/items/89587-porcupette.

Even if you aren't ready to battle just yet, there are three other new pets at the Darkmoon Faire. The Darkmoon Glowfly http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/67329-darkmoon-glowfly can be captured during pet battles on Darkmoon Island. The Crow http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/67443-crow will also be captured from battles on Darkmoon Island, but is currently bugged and uncapturable. The Darkmoon Hatchling http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/67319-darkmoon-hatchling is sold by Lhara http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/14846-lhara for 90 x http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/463/384/16/16/inv-misc-ticket-darkmoon-01.ico Darkmoon Prize Ticket http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/515-darkmoon-prize-ticket.

Lastly, "Dusty" Brandom http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/68492-dusty-brandom is now waiting for you at the entrance to let you use one of his Darkmoon Striders on the way down. This is the same model that is used by the Swift Forest Strider http://www.wowdb.com/items/72140-swift-forest-strider, sold for 180 x http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/463/384/16/16/inv-misc-ticket-darkmoon-01.ico Darkmoon Prize Ticket http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/515-darkmoon-prize-ticket.

A friend was just offered Brawlers Guild Pass
As we've stated in the past, we want the Brawler's Guild to have that tight knit, underground kind of feel to it. So for now, it's going to be a lot tougher to get in. I'm sure you have other friends who would be willing to give you an invite for free or very cheap if they had one. As membership grows in the guild, so will the chance of one of them getting invited and having one to share with you. 

Keep in mind, invites also occasionally drop from certain Horde and Alliance NPCs. Good luck! Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/246736-a-friend-was-just-offered-brawlers-guild-pass/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7200034156?page=1#11

Any thoughts on boomkins in pve? no blue responses on forums or mentions in patches. feels like we are being ignored as a com 
"Ignored" got so over-used that it stopped catching my eye expansions ago. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/266291986842128384

Can't believe I spent all of last raid with Holy Avenger instead of Divine Purpose. Was testing to see if DL/FoL got the 30% bonus. Nope! 
I could have told you that! No responses to my bug reports, tickets to tweets to @Ghostcrawler about how Holy Avenger is buggy. 
Holy: Looks like HA works with ToR after all. I have concerns, but if it's already working and not abusive, we see no reason to remove it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/266240575529959424

I'm pretty impressed you guys aren't falling victim to all the people whining about warrior damage. They'll be fine in 5.1 imo 
Hard for folks to imagine how 5.1 nerfs feel so people keep falling back to how it feels today. Still broken = nerf plz! 

Character
Why a weekly valor cap? I have thought about it and can't come up with a good reason. 
Without a cap, progression oriented players might feel the need to play every waking minute. That can lead to just quitting. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/267423927893110784

Regarding the alt unfriendliness of MoP. You created a huge requirement sink and refuse to address the elephant in the room 
If an alt gets every accomplishment your main has then you have few reasons to play that alt. There has to be a better design. 
I disagree Greg. I play dif chars because I want to play a dif class, not to get some achieves. Make them all .net bound. 
But what are you going to do on that character if it has everything the main does. Just raid? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/267351318614659072

Sometimes I wish WoW had a class system like FFXI. Not saying it would work, but I did like that character devotion 
Yeah that's the extreme, where you level the account once and then play any class. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/267426076186275841

From the alt discussion, sounds like many think X you only have to do once and Y you should do every character. X and Y vary of course. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/267754296660074496

Some view alts as new char to build from scratch. Others see as just playstyle change fr. main, so build = repetitive hassle. 
Yep, I agree that is the basic issue. Just concerned that if we make alts too trivial to progress that we lose gameplay. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/267755283420434432

What things do you keep in mind when making the decision if something should be account bound? 
Many same questions. Does BoA mean the alt has a leg up or the alt is "done?" Leveling alts with no bonuses worked for years. I'm thinking that the role of alts and which accomplishments inc rep should be on the character or on the account would make a good blog. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/267419814526595072

Isn't the reason most people roll alts is to play different class. Not for achievements 
But with enough sharing and XP bonuses you're just getting every class if you max out one. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/267424314410799105

So its not OK to expect to be able to taste the content you just lauched? 
We make content all the time that isn't available to every player ASAP. In this case, you'll get there at some point. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/265980134086025217

I'm a mage and my transmog is the 25m T8. Could we have matching belt/boots we don't have access to, used in game by Rhonin? 
We're looking at ways to introduce popular t'mog items that aren't available anymore. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/267016042121940993

PvE
Why do nerf cleave on Garalon, it always worked the same, on Zon'ozz for example, why dont nerf it before? 
If you get a 400% bonus, the intent is not that your cleaves get that bonus. Rogues etc should be desirable not mandatory. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/267424904801046528

PvP
I am getting 1 shotted by either a mage or warrior, when my life is at 180k half. 
That's not the conventional definition of one-shotted. Many abilities hit for 100k. It's when you get to 400k that no counter. 
One shotted can also mean dying in one GCD, from full, or as near as as makes no difference. This DOES happen. 
No, that's actually the definition we use one GCD but from full health and only vs one opponent. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/267426643440713729

Based on some of these tweets, I'm thinking some of you won't be happy until the only spell left in PvP is autoattack. 
Nice hyperbole....I think most people will be content just not getting instantly globaled by TFB/Stampede type abilities. 
Those at least mentioned by several players. If you look at my tweets there are demands to nerf Lava Burst, HoJ, Hellfire... Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/266353171763441664

Thats akin to having a skill with 99.99% 1 damage and 0.01% 1M damage. Rare doesnt mean TfB is balanced or good design. 
It's possible to step into Arena and be crit by every single attack, but we don't balance around what's possible, just reasonable. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/266236427593977856

If gladiator players who you always mention think tfb is op then how can you not?...300k in arena should not be possible. done 
We don't let players, even expert ones, balance the game for us. We appreciate their feedback, as we do all feedback. 
I respect you, Greg Street, but how obvious does it have to be? 1-shotting is not OK no matter how RNG it is. EoD. 
I actually agree with that, but nobody is 1-shotting you with TfB or CB. 5-stack TfB crit does what 250K? 2 or 3 shot maybe. 
With everything up and tier 2 it can go over 300k; and heroic strikes not on the GCD so HS+MS = 1 shot 
Do you get MS for > 100K for a lot? If it requires every cooldown + MS + mastery proc + 5 TfB then we're in the realm of videos. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/266238950442668032

Did you try the approach of Rock paper scissor for PvP ? Or increase it if you consider it live already. 
I don't think RPS works for WoW Arena because you've already picked your comp. That does not mean strengths and weaknesses are bad. 
RPS on the talent system can work though. Having to figure out which talent set to pick to best defeat a comp is great 
I don't honestly think RPS is a great metaphor. Even in RTS, rock can beat paper in the right situations. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/266560299824451585

Future
Weren't they supposed to be implementing a "hide enchants" feature? Or is it delayed until Dance Studio?
Dance Studio is just a huge project. Enchants require new code, but not new art or design. Much easier. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/267426982730555394

Questing
Do you plan to do something with the daily-reputation system? Many players hate it, and want tabards back 
Grinding a rep out in one night by running a dungeon over and over is probably never coming back. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/266561184206057472

Without tabard spam dungeons feels really unrewarding past 463. Used to do it all the time in Wrath, hate it now. 
We don't think having dungeon rep replace daily rep is the answer, but maybe we can come up with a compromise. 
Why not? Seriously greg, it worked well in the previous expansions. Gate it if you want to pace it, but it worked 
Disagree that it worked. I get that it was convenient but queuing for instances doesn't feel like a persistent world MMO. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/266925541528072193

Misc
Do devs ever make changes to game based on their personal Live play xpr? Not to buff themselves, but just improve things. 
Sure. We sometimes notice bugs that slipped through or just something that doesn't feel as fun as we thought. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/267756163502850048

Wouldn't this encourage people to buy from gold sellers? 
We try to give gold value while the best rewards unrelated to gold. A fantasy world with no gold economy would be odd. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/265979728031277057

So I'm curious Greg, what other games besides Blizzard's are you playing at the moment, if any? 
Borderlands 2, XCOM, a little Arkham City, a replay of ME3 and some dumb iOS games. AC3, Halo4 in the pipe. I play a lot of games. 
Do other games affect your design philosophy? I was affected by the openness in skyrim. Changed the way i see games 
We play a lot of game and always looking for neat ideas or features that become expected or industry standard. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/267048357183238144


WoWDB Addon Data Collection
