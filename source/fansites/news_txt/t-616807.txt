09/30 - Upcoming update on Beta/PTR Servers
Tonight, both beta and PTR servers will be updated to a new build.
We will be taking down the Beta realms at 2:15PM Pacific time today September 30th 2008 to update to the latest build

We expect this process to take from five to seven hours. 

WotLK Arena Changes

We've revaluated certain aspects of how the arena system and current arena season will be affected during both the next content patch, and the launch of Wrath of the Lich King. For starters, the current arena season will end in respect to the ladder upon the release of our next major patch. What this means is, we'll be taking a snapshot of the current season's ladder just before the realms are taken down for patch maintenance, and our normal process will commence to determine who is eligible for the end-of-season rewards. Teams and ratings will not be wiped at that time, and will carry forward allowing players to earn points each week and buy gear until the launch of the expansion on November 13th. Almost immediately before Wrath of the Lich King releases, all arena teams as well as ratings will be wiped and arena charter NPCs disabled.
