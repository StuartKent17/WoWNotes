chaud2016-07-06, 03:02 PMDemon Bounties Beta Key Giveaway
The Burning Legion is heading our way and to help thin the number of demons already in the lands of Azeroth, we’ve teamed up with various community members to set a bounty on their heads.

We’ve gathered some of our finest generals from the community to lead the onslaught. You’ll want to follow them closely and be ready to jump into the fray to take on the demon they issue a bounty on. Once the demon is targeted, you’ll be asked to head into Azeroth, Outland, or Draenor, to screenshot any demon of that specific type dead or alive, and tweet it using the associated hashtag.

Your efforts could result in netting you a key to the Legion beta test and joining the thousands who have already been testing the upcoming expansion.
