<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
<br>
Experience earned from gaining Honor has been reduced by approximately 50%.<br>
<br>
Developer&#x2019;s note: We want battlegrounds and skirmishes to be a worthwhile and rewarding activity while leveling, but that should not be the most efficient method for gaining XP. While we&apos;ve decreased the experience from PvP, it is still more efficient than it was in previous expansions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Quests<br>
<br>
Fixed an issue where faction transfers would interfere with Death Knight&apos;s ability to complete the Class Hall quest &quot;The Firstborn Rises&quot;.<br>
Fixed a bug causing players who died during the sequence of Dalaran&apos;s teleportion would get stuck in Deadwind Pass.<br>
Paladins should now be able to progress with their Class Hall Campaigns after completing the quest &quot;The Scion&apos;s Legacy&quot;, by speaking with Lord Maxwell Tyrosus.<br>
Teensy Weensy Fae Dragons should now appear more frequently during the quest &#x201C;Teensy Weenies!&#x201D;.<br>

Players should no longer be erroneously placed in a phase in Deadwind Pass that makes them unable to complete quests in the area, including &quot;Following the Curse.&quot;<br>
Hunters completing to quest to obtain their second or third artifact should no longer receive the quest &quot;Hunter to Hunter&quot; after turn-in.<br>
The points of interest for the Warrior quest &#x201C;Legacy of the Icebreaker&quot; are now displaying correctly and the stage objectives update appropriately.<br>
<br>
<br>
Azsuna<br>
<br>
Daglop should no longer disengage with the player, allowing &#x201C;Minion! Kill Them!&#x201D; to be completed normally.<br>
During &quot;The Right Weapon for the Job&quot;, shipwrecked captives in the Shipwreck Arena clubhouse should no longer glow as if they&#x2019;re viable targets for the quest.<br>
Players who leave the area and return during the &#x201C;The Scythe of Souls&#x201D; should be able to complete the quest.<br>
Players entering the Nor&apos;danil Wellspring in Azsuna should no longer be incorrectly queued to enter the Withered Scenario in Suramar.<br>
Players should no longer fail to loot several quest objects in the Nar&#x2019;thalas Academy during quests such as &quot;Study Hall: Combat Research&quot; and &#x201C;Dressing with Class&#x201D;.<br>

<br>
<br>
Stormheim<br>
<br>
&quot;Waking the Shieldmaiden&quot; now has a correctly-placed location dot on the map.<br>
<br>
<br>
Val&#x2019;sharah<br>
<br>
Fixed a number of issues with the &quot;Defend The Temple&quot; Bonus Objective in Val&apos;sharah.<br>
<br>
<br>
UI<br>
<br>
Obelisk of the Void should appear in the Dungeon Journal for all ranged damage dealers and healers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Zones<br>
<br>
Orgrimmar, Stormwind, and previously invasion-affected areas should once again be unified for single realms.<br>
<br>
Developer&#x2019;s note: On RP servers, we&#x2019;re setting sharding and cross-realm zoning back to how things were working before the Burning Legion invaded. This had been changed for stability during pre-launch events and invasions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
World Quests &amp; Cross-Realm Grouping<br>
We&#x2019;re currently tracking an issue that can cause players to &#x201C;lose&#x201D; World Quests when grouping with other players cross-realm. Correcting this issue is a top priority for us, and we&#x2019;re working hard on a fix, but wanted to share some workarounds for this issue in the meantime.<br>
<br>
You can tell if you&#x2019;re experiencing this issue by checking the quest tracker (which, by default, at the right side of your screen. If you don&#x2019;t see the World Quest there, it&#x2019;s not currently active for you. You can re-activate it by doing one of the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
Logging out and back in to that character <br>
Running a fair distance away from the World Quest area and then back <br>
<br>
<br>
Additionally, if you plan to join a cross-realm group to do a World Quest, you can avoid this issue by joining that group before you arrive at the World Quest area. Note that this issue only occurs when using cross-realm grouping.<br>
<br>
Again, we&#x2019;re hard at work on a fix for the issue, but the above workarounds should allow you to complete World Quests properly until that fix is in place.<br>

Legion Auction House<br>
We are discussing adding an Engineering Auction House to Dalaran, much as it was in Wrath of the Lich King.<br>
<br>
I&apos;ll update this thread with any more information I hear on this. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/758774-please-add-auction-houses-to-legion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20748836407?page=3#44))<br>

Dalaran Underbelly Guards<br>
When people signed up for PVE server we were under the impression that PVP will be purely optional. From what I can tell bodyguard doesn&apos;t always work.<br>
<br>
Bodyguards are bugged. Once they&apos;re fixed its a non issue unless 5g is too steep.<br>
We&apos;ve seen reports of this, just a heads up that we are looking into issues reported with bodyguards in the Underbelly.

I still don&apos;t understand how you get gear from pvp or what item level it is and what you do to get higher item level gear.<br>
not happy with the transparency on this. Getting fixed in 7.1. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/770253937517531137))<br>
