Patch 8.1 Hotfixes - February 14, 2019
Dungeons and Raids

Battle of Dazar’alor

High Tinker Mekkatorque

Wind Up now grants 10% Haste and Movement Speed in Heroic difficulty was 20%.
Boss health lowered by 5% in Heroic difficulty.

King Rastakhan

Seal of Purification, Scorching Detonation, and Withering Burst should no longer hit pets.



Uldir

Taloc

Orbs of Harmony will now respawn when the Taloc encounter resets.




Player versus Player

Restoration Druid mana regeneration is now reduced by 55% in PvP.
Holy Priest, Holy Paladin, Restoration Shaman, and Mistweaver Monk mana regeneration is now reduced by 50% in PvP.
Discipline Priest mana regeneration is now reduced by 45% in PvP.
Balance Druid, Feral Druid, and Elemental Shaman mana regeneration is reduced by 35% in PvP.

Developers’ notes: We’ve taken a careful look at healer mana during longer PvP engagements in both Arenas and battlegrounds, and the changes above are intended to address several concerns. In PvP, we want mana to feel like a more critical resource, and we want mana efficiency to be an important part of PvP healing. At the beginning of Battle for Azeroth, mana regeneration from all healer specs was reduced by 15-30% depending on the class, and after reviewing the current state of the game, we feel like further reductions are necessary to both healer specs and a few hybrid specs.

Whirling Dragon Punch Bug
are you guys aware about the whirling dragon punch bug for windwalkers? I haven’t read anything acknowledging it and its pretty game influencing
With Whirling Dragon Punch, there seems to be a bug causing a cooldown discrepancy. We’re testing it in 8.1.5, where it appears to be fixed, and appreciate the heads-up.
