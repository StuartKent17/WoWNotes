The release date of Patch 4.2 is getting close and I will recap its major features throughout the week to end up with a nice and complete guide to Patch 4.2 for the release, hopefully on June 28th. Let&apos;s start with the highly anticipated Encounter Journal!<br>

<br>
<br>
Encounter Journal<br>
The Encounter Journal is an in-game encylopedia listing everything you need to know on instances and raid bosses. Assuming people start using it regularly, it will probably fix a lot of issues people had in pick up groups where people were just too afraid to ask what a boss does and would rather die than look stupid and get kicked. <br>
<br>
The encounter journal can be accessed from the bottom menu bar or by hitting CTRL + Shift + J on your keyboard. <br>
<br>
<br>
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/june/ejbutton.jpg<br>
<br>
You will then access the instance selection menu with a &quot;Dungeons&quot; and &quot;Raids&quot; tabs, allowing you to get details on any raid or dungeon encounter introduced in Cataclysm (including the Firelands raid) <br>

Firelands Raid Boss Selection&lt;/td&gt;<br>
&lt;/tr&gt;<br>
&lt;/table&gt;<br>
<br>
Encounter Journal - Boss Loot Lists<br>
The encounter journal includes a list of items dropped by each boss with a couple of extra features:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The list can be filtered for 10 and 25-Man encounters. It doesn&apos;t really change anything these days but it will probably be useful if an item is only available in 25-Man at some point, or when older raids are supported. <br>
The &quot;Heroic Mode&quot; filter is also available in the loot list and will display loot from the Heroic version.<br>
A filter by class, to easily get a list of the gear relevant to your class only. (The Druid filter automatically lists all the items in the instance)<br>
You can also list the loot from all the bosses in the instance by clicking the Chest icon when at the Boss selection screen. <br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;table style=&quot;font-weight:bold; margin:auto; text-align:center;&quot;&gt;<br>

Instance Loot Table&lt;/td&gt;<br>
&lt;/tr&gt;<br>
&lt;/table&gt;<br>
<br>
Boss Information and Abilities<br>
The main objective of the Encounter Journal is to give you all the information you need to engage a boss without being clueless about what&apos;s going to happen to you and your raid. The journal provides you with:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A description of all the abilities used by the boss.<br>
A description of all abilities used by NPC adds that might spawn during the encounter. (Hostile and Friendly)<br>
The evolution of the fight over multiple stages. <br>
A general idea of how mechanics work. <br>
An &quot;heroic only&quot; filter to display abilities and variations of the fight only happening in Heroic Mode. <br>
<br>
<br>
You might also notice a couple of icons icons next to some of the spells. Those are alerts used to bring your attention to important point of the fights, 12 Alerts are available in the current version of the Encounter Journal:<br>
