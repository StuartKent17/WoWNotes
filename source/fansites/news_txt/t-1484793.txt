Warlords of Draenor Developer Interviews
There were a few developer interviews at the recent press events, so today we are taking a look at an interview with Alex Afrasiabi from games.on.net http://games.on.net/2014/03/looting-housing-and-pushing-the-level-cap-we-visit-blizzard-to-check-out-warlords-of-draenor/. 


There is no guarantee that all character models will be done by release, but they hope to have most ready.
The biggest thing stopping players from coming back is leveling. 
As the game got older, more and more content was added, which makes it harder for people to catch up when they return.
Having to deal with all of the other things that are a part of coming back to the game along with leveling is too much for some people.
When you come back to the game and use a boost, your bars are cleared, talents unlearned, 
The team also looked at significantly increasing experience rates rather than offering a boost, but it didn't feel great and the boost was the better option.


Warlords of Draenor - New Blingtron
It looks like Engineers will be getting a new Blingtron http://wowpedia.org/Blingtron_4000 in Warlords of Draenor, but not a new mount https://twitter.com/TheCrafticus/status/448990251537547264.

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/gb-en.png Official Class Roles Forums Closing EU
Hello everyone, 

So that player discussions remain concentrated in existing forums where they receive more attention from other players, we have made the decision to retire the following forums. These forums will be deactivated next week: 

Damage Dealing http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/896511/
Healing http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/896512/
Tanking http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/896513/

In preparation for their final closure, these forums will remain accessible in Read Only mode, but will be removed permanently on 8 April 2014. If you wish to save any relevant information, please do so before then.

Will New Veng buff self heals? Dev team's goal for value of Bonus Armor vs other stats situational or always good?
Yes, it'll buff self heals. Bonus Armor is always good, except the extremely rare case where you're taking no physical damage. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444179300934094848
Or the damage bypasses armor.
I think having physical-flagged damage that bypasses armour is a silly design. Just use magic to do it.
Not at all. Bleeds, sonic spells, etc... All totally make sense as non-magic but not reduced by armor. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444195530172682240
OK I'll give you those! But what about things like Malkorok's Blood Rage. It is an obvious physical weapon attack.
Balance. We don't want to hit clothies harder than plate/shield wearers for that. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444197034073919488

haste, that you'd get the 84 damage in exactly 14 seconds, with the partial tick appearing 14.0s after cast 6 DPS.
Yes, duration never changes. You'll get the partial tick at 14sec after cast. DPS won't have breakpoints. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444969364446380032
Are you still planning to give everyone a Pandemic mechanic?
Yes, but 130% duration max, not 150%. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444972903159713792
So if you recast way before the first partial tick, will you end up with "queued" partials?
No, partial ticks are only when the dot falls off before its' next scheduled tick. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444974470722113539

Warlords of Draenor Stats
do you know how current dodge/parry stats on items will be changing in 6.0? Should I stockpile them "just in case"?
They'll be replaced with other useful stats. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444334736626814976

I knew that Cleave got dropped. I thought socket/multistrike/readiness were all rare 'bonus tertiaries' in WoD. Got a source?
No, Multistrike and Readiness are full, legitimate secondary stats, like Haste/Crit/Mastery. Socket is a bonus tertiary. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444206840667066368
still wondering how you're gonna make Multistrike appeal to tanks.
Been working on that recently. Nothing to announce yet, but it'll be spec-specific passives that interact with multistrike. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444552553888362496
so things like grand crusader, revenge, Crimson scourge?
Yeah, that style of ability though different effects. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444600725285253121

Does everyone have a baseline level of Multistrike / Readiness, like Crit & Mastery, or is it possible to have 0, like Haste?
Zero baseline. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444608388475805696

PvE
How were Large Anima Golems supposed to be used in the Dark Animus encounter, especially on heroic?
To buy you more time on the enrage. But they ended up being too dangerous/disruptive to make it worth the benefit. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/441617682006151168

Could some indication that a spell is armor ignoring physical be added to the DJ? It is occasionally unclear.
It's certainly something we can do a better job of calling out when it comes to tank mechanics. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/444199433689788417

PvP
Will we see any balance changesonce the new PvP Gear shows its full effect ?
Perhaps. At this point we will only be able to do hotfixes which limits our options. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/444161261257773056

Any chance we could see TB and WG put in as 40v40 BGs so they are full?
More focused on building Ashran. WG and TB had their time to shine. It would take a lot of work to restore them properly. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/444182264453156864

Hard to get conquest losing in flag cap RBGs compared to losing in an AB-style RBG. Intended? Flag cap = so black and white.
It's the nature of CTF. You're comparing a map with a score of 3 to a map with a score of 1600. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/444362032171601920

Warlords of Draenor
Any plans on making Thorim soloable for everyone?
Changed in 6.0: Thorim won't trigger the deathball/reset when his arena is empty. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443478029667278848
Valithria is soloable, not sure what is wrong.
By, say, a warrior? Probably just going to make her skippable. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443480317681102848
Yeah, that was a joke coming from a healer, but great to hear Ulduar/ICC are getting a look - how about Vezax?
What's the concern with Vezax? WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443482225426714625
Yeah, Vezax and the trash leading up to him won't be there. Need to soft reset.
Fixed that also in 6.0. Thanks. Could happen if you killed one of the Keepers very quickly. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443541773244063745
