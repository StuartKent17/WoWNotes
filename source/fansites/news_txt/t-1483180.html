really disappointing and quite telling that imbalances are left in for the same of something as silly as faction balance<br>
If there were no racials, Humans would still be by far the most popular class on the Alliance. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443802815874351104))<br>

Snake Trap is really only used for Entrapment anyway<br>
Nope.I use it every fight for the various poisons it does especially the all important slow poison.<br>
Do you really need two different traps to slow enemies? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444189559933255680))<br>

No scatter shot is not gone.We tried traps activating instantly.Warriors still will charge over them.<br>
Warriors will not charge over traps. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444189293364248577))<br>
You promise?Because right now Ive seen hundreds of players just cruise right over them.Even in direct los.<br>

Since Fire scales much better then all other specs, devs had to nerf it every major patch to get it back in line<br>
It doesn&apos;t necessarily have to scale better than other specs. We have one change coming that helps prop it up at early gear levels. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444562149747064832))<br>

Hoping for an answer. I &lt;3 Arc Torrent on my healadin for the mana return. Still happen in WoD? Or all pally specs getting HP?<br>
All Paladins get Holy Power instead of Mana. Holy Power will be more valuable, though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443579008668536833))<br>
No more mana for paladins, inc holy? Very big change! Moving MW to energy also? Or did I read too much into that?<br>
You misread. This is talking about Arcane Torrent, the Blood Elf Racial. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443583033057091584))<br>
Sir celestalon, will it still do aoe silence or will it just be a resource gain?<br>
Still does that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443604208126656513))<br>
<br>
Anyway you could talk about design philosophy when approaching Retribution in WoD?<br>
Anything in particular? Generally planning polish and tuning, but no major revision. Happy with Ret design, minus a couple tweaks. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444972067423657984))<br>

rogues are very dependant of crit, any buff for them in wod?<br>
It&apos;s folly to ask for buffs when fixating on one specific change without considering all of the other changes coming. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443556328678518785))<br>

Is paralytic poison gone, or did it go baseline?<br>
It is gone in Warlords. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443801809631465472))<br>

Any plans on taking a look at Windfury Weapon in WoD? lots of us feel it&apos;s lost it&apos;s wow factor (scuse the pun) in recent expacs<br>
We&apos;re investigating whether we can take the cooldown off it (but still not proc off itself). No promises though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444974047613304832))<br>

so will u also make arcane torrent more valuabke to warlocks? Mana useless, need either burning ember soul shard or demonic fury<br>
A whole soul shard is too much, which is a problem. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444204241448484864))<br>
whats about other specs. Half a burning ember or 100 demonic fury doesnt seem like a problem<br>
Problem is consistency. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444204747109572608))<br>
but u can see how mana is useless for lock? Love belfs but turn between changing race :-S trolls an orcs look more appealing<br>
BElf still gives 1% Crit, so not useless. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444206300566544384))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Also, with valor/justice gone, what&apos;s going to be the carrot to get people to complete groups in WoD?<br>
We&apos;ll have more info in weeks ahead, but we agree it&apos;s important that people are incentivized to not bail mid-run. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/444252558794584064))<br>
<br>
cata healing changes. with all the changes happening with healing, is SoO going to be reduced burst damage output? cont<br>
SoO will be adjusted to suit any class changes. It won&apos;t be more difficult in 6.0. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443940861370318848))<br>
<br>
in 6.0 will SoO go to the new raiding system? Norm and Hero flex specifically<br>
Yes, it will. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/444695183209140224))<br>
<br>
What&apos;s the word on Mythic trash? I feel it would add a lot of immersion to the dungeons. Still have nightmares of AQ trash.<br>
No more dynamic difficulty swapping means that raids will have Mythic trash. And yes, that means Mythic trash loot. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439085907967111168))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
running dungeons then converting JP to honor is faster than queueing bgs... can u fix that<br>
We did one wave of buffs to honor rate. We may do another based on what we see. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443551299053707264))<br>
<br>
By &apos;mean&apos; you mean &apos;poorly designed,&apos; right?<br>
World PvP is deliberately unstructured &amp; emergent. If you want a fair fight, we have instances (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/444877255756365824))<br>
<br>
With the expansion coming on december and the season ending in 20 weeks what are we going to do during this big gap without arenas?<br>
We have made no announcement about when the season will end or when the game will be released. You&apos;re making bad assumptions. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443195572413952000))<br>
I was just assuming the worst case scenario. Should we expect a 30+ weeks season, like s11?<br>
sorry, we don&apos;t comment/speculate on the length of a season. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443403195369263104))<br>
<br>
How does the team feel about the new arena ladder? I kinda miss teams because I liked starting fresh on a new charter. What&apos;s yours<br>
We&apos;re quite happy with the change. In general it feels like an improvement. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443431600571686913))<br>

I&apos;ve seen that extremely rarely, and always found that flying away and coming back solved it. Sorry! (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443183790366543872))<br>
We cant fly in warlord&apos;s how do we solve issues like this.<br>
A) We don&apos;t intend to have bugs like that. B) I just said &apos;fly&apos; as that&apos;s what&apos;s common now. &apos;Ride&apos; does the same thing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443263887119380480))<br>
