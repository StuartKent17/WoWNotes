Warfronts Testing and Feedback - Battle for Azeroth Beta<br>
With the current Beta build, Beta testers are experiencing the entirety of the Warfronts: Battle for Stromgarde experience. An alternating cycle kicked off on Thursday, June 7 between the Horde and Alliance vying for control of Stromgarde and Arathi Highlands. Both Horde and Alliance testers have queued since then.<br>
<br>
Here&#x2019;s an outline of how the cycle works:<br>
<br>
<br>
The Alliance starts with ownership of Arathi Highlands, and Horde players challenge them by contributing professions items, gold, and War Resources to help their faction build up enough strength to attack. This is a region-wide effort. Once enough contributions are supplied by the region, the Warfront: Battle for Stromgarde unlocks and Horde players are able to queue for the experience. This queue remains open for a set duration, allowing players to complete the Warfront on a schedule that works for them. After the Horde attack is complete, the Horde takes control of Arathi Highlands, giving them access to a unique World Boss and a series of rare spawns and other rewards only available during the period when their faction owns the zone. The Alliance then begins contributing resources to challenge Horde control.<br>
<br>
The cycle continues perpetually, with each faction competing against the other to gain access more quickly or reduce the enemy team&#x2019;s access to the zone. Currently, the queue window in the Beta is set to remain open for 2 days.<br>
<br>
Notably, this update included a first look at a completely updated version of the Arathi Highlands zone, including new creatures, as well as access to your faction&#x2019;s base in the zone, and plenty of other surprises.<br>
<br>
Please feel free to post your feedback on Warfronts in this thread, and please submit issues with Warfronts to our BFA Beta Bug Report Forum.<br>
