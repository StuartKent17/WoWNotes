chaud2018-03-15, 03:38 AMBattle for Azeroth Island Expeditions Preview
Battle for Azeroth brings a new Island Expeditions feature. Taking what the team liked from Mists of Pandaria's scenarios and stepping it up, these expeditions take a team of three players to uncharted islands across the Great sea in search of Azerite. Each island is randomly generated and so there is always something unique and new to find. Also, the enemy AI does not behave like normal scripted creature AI. Instead, you face an opposing team that will fight in a much more unpredictable way. Island Expeditions are also role agnostic, meaning that they do not require a Tank, Healer and DPS in order to succeed.

A new Battle for Azeroth feature, Island Expeditions, is now available for testing for characters at level 110 or higher. Your level and item level will be automatically adjusted to level 120 values.

Alliance players can queue from the Expedition table in Boralus Harbor, near the Tradewinds Market. Look for the green ship occupying the second slip. 

Horde players can queue from the Expedition table in Zuldazar Harbor, at the Port of Zandalar, on the west side. Look for the red ship.

What are we testing?
We are currently testing Un’gol Ruins on Normal difficulty.
There are 12 NPC teams available for testing 6 per faction.

What is the goal of an Island Expedition?
The goal of an Island Expedition is to collect Azerite. The first team to 6000 Azerite wins.
A group of NPCs from the opposing faction will also be present, competing with you for the Azerite.
Many things on the Island reward Azerite: chests, Azerite crystals, powerful creatures, friendly NPCs in need of aid, killing enemy NPCs, and more.
You’ll find things you can interact with, scattered all across the Island to help you.

Good luck!

Disclaimer: this feature is currently in an alpha state. There are several placeholder elements and missing pieces. Many updates are on their way.

Thank you for testing, and we’re looking forward to your feedback.

And watch out for Sneaky Pete :]


Dynamic Replayability
The team wants Islands to be a unique experience every time you queue up for one. There are countless different themes, enemies and environments you can come across and it's random each time you start one. Islands will have distinct visuals including abandoned Gilnean islands or Ungol ruins. There will also be different puzzles and obstacles to face every time you visit. In one scenario you could find a bunch of friendly trolls and aid them but in the next one these trolls could be possessed and attack you. Other scenarios include finding shrines or fighting against a giant crab.

Island Content that is randomly generated:

Creatures
Capture points
Chests and Azerite Nodes
Questgivers
Consumables and Shrines
Start Locations
Weather
Environmental hazards
Caves, Ships...and more!



                        


Enemy AI
Battle for Azeroth will feature new NPC AI for Island Expeditions. This AI is not scripted and will not behave in the way a normal creature usually does. This new AI will behave in a more PVP orientated fashion. Examples include polymorphing or sapping your healer while you are engaged in a boss fight. This AI also is well aware of important map objectives and will constantly be giving you a run for your money as you race to complete objectives. This AI can make strategic decisions as well. They may stop what they are doing to come disrupt the objective you are working on or to steal your azerite. Different opponents will also have distinct personalities and unique behaviors. An example would be Sneaky Pete, a rogue who likes to disrupt healers.


        


Difficulty Modes
Island Expeditions have 4 difficult modes:

Normal
Heroic
Mythic
PVP

Island Consumables
A seafaring vendor shows up at the docks each day to provide unqiue buffs and consumables to use on the island. These power ups tend to fill in role gaps. Examples include buffs to make an Arms  Warrior more tanky or another consumable that allows a  Mage to heal.

Rewards
The team hasn't finalized on all the rewards yet, but they have said azerite, unique mounts and new toys are definitely options.
