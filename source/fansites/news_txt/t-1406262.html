Ability Squish<br>
We do feel that, at least for some classes, there are a few too many buttons to keep on your action bars. It&apos;s an issue we&apos;d ultimately like to solve, but something we have to be very, very careful with.<br>
<br>
It&apos;s easy to look at your bar, go &quot;LOOKIT ALL DEM BUTTONS&quot;, and decide that some of them need to go. In fact, we agree. It&apos;s much more difficult -- even dangerous -- to decide exactly which abilities to get rid of. Generally speaking, if you have an ability keybound, it&apos;s probably at least fairly important to your class. Getting rid of abilities you don&apos;t have bound doesn&apos;t really fix anything, so that means that, in most cases, we&apos;re talking about cutting the important ones.<br>
<br>
That&apos;s not to say it can&apos;t (or won&apos;t) be done, but it does mean it&apos;s a fairly large task. Depending on the ability, there could be a lot of rebalancing or restructuring needed to make sure the class is still functional and fun to play. Again, it&apos;s something we&apos;d like to do, it&apos;s just a very involved process.<br>
<br>
Something you didn&apos;t really touch on is how some abilities exist as flavour for the class. The last time this kind of ability trimming occurred, a lot of things we players took for fun and playing about wound up biting the bullet because they were seen as &quot;unnecessary&quot; (i.e. Hunter&apos;s Eyes of the Beast). <br>
True, and we want to avoid that. As I mentioned above, removing abilities you don&apos;t often use doesn&apos;t accomplish much. We often talk about this issue in terms of action bar space, but it&apos;s really keybind space that&apos;s the problem. One could make an argument that, say, Unending Breath could stand to be cut, but that&apos;s not something that&apos;s going to free up a keybind for the vast majority of Warlocks. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/281862-i-am-absolutely-begging-for-an-ability-squish/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10673937505?page=5#94))<br>
<br>
Patch 5.4.2 Warrior Changes<br>
We don&apos;t feel that Warrior damage output itself is the issue. It&apos;s strong, but not out of line compared to other classes. We think the issue lies with mobility, and the Warrior&apos;s ability to keep that constant pressure going. That&apos;s why we decided to revert the 5.4 Intervene change in 5.4.2 and move the root break back to Safeguard. Once we&apos;ve had a chance to see how that affects things, we&apos;ll be able to decide if any further changes are necessary.

Reputation / Questing<br>
Why not take the leap into mounted combat using the tech from quests like The Drakkensryd from back in Wrath?<br>
It would take months of work to feel decent and not hacked in like it was in the (overall awesome) Drakkenryd quest. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403952433182695424))<br>
<br>
Dailies are a grind because being able to use your class is not really a challenge anymore to ANYONE.<br>
I agree that&apos;s a problem when you start to overgear the content. Say Isle of Thunder at its launch still had challenging mobs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402548132644261888))<br>
<br>
With the success of the Warlock Green Fire quest chain, are you planning to add quest chains for other classes?<br>
If and when it makes sense. We like the feature overall but don&apos;t want it to become formulaic. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403951705634533376))<br>
<br>
Technically questing is trivial. It&apos;s not hard and everyone can do it. It&apos;s simply a time sink until raiding.<br>
We could make WoW a game only about raiding. I don&apos;t think it would be as popular though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403610252920115202))<br>
You know, the &quot;heart and soul&quot; thingie which is played by 5% of your players.<br>
I don&apos;t know where that number comes from. Raiding is very popular. But that doesn&apos;t mean all players raid. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403638644931428352))<br>
<br>
Not the same as saying &quot;okay but make it trivial for alts&quot;. Just reduce the restrictions since we&apos;ve already done it all once.<br>
Why? Why is being able to click quest objects without fighting anything a better design than just skipping questing altogether? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403637597685051392))<br>
<br>
Yet at max lvl, we won&apos;t be questing (no dailies at max lvl), so no real change from current flying design decision<br>
You will be out in the world doing stuff, more like Timeless Isle than Golden Lotus. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403606941240262656))<br>
But pls give to that T. Isle 2.0. some structure. Killing 2k Yaungols without the pacing/reward that a daily gave is boring.<br>
Yeah, it won&apos;t just be Timeless Isle 2.0. That&apos;s just an example of content that isn&apos;t just &quot;Kill 10 mogu every day.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403633384842215424))<br>
<br>
in WOD will we see more shared mob tagging outside of groups. Really like that in other games. Allow more impromptu grouping<br>
We&apos;d like to improve our tagging rules for sure. Not convinced dot everything to get credit on all is the right design. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403604039591395328))</div></div>
