Boubouille2007-09-23, 07:57 AM<a name="brewfest"></a>Update : Added screenshots of the goggles effect at the bottom of the post. Best item ever http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/goggles7.jpg !

2.2.2 Patch is available on PTR you will have to remove your old PTR version and download the new one from the official site, otherwise you will see new NPCs as blue and white boxes. You can now test the brewfest ! I spent a stupid amount of time on the PTR yesterday and took the time to write a brewfest guide mostly because you can get a mount here. So here it goes ! Feel free to add any missing information in comments. 

[anchor=brewfest] Brewfest guide October 3 - October 16 Alliance/Horde perspective
Now this is ram racing ... Almost Ram Tutorial
The first quest you will get is a tutorial on how to use a racing ram. You will need ram racing reins from the apprentice next to the quest giver to speed up with your mount, you can consider your speed like an energy bar that you fill everytime you use the reins. Basically, everytime you switch to trot, using the reins 4 times will get you to the "max" level of canter, using it a 5th time will change it to a galop, and smashing the button like mad will eventually exhaust your mount when your Ram Fatigue debuff reaches 100 and get you stuck in place for 15 seconds. You can also pass near apples buckets http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/apples.jpg to remove the ram fatigue debuff, there is one next to the signs after the bridge and another one behind the guy you need to see in Kharanos.

Daily Quest - There and Back Again
Reward : 10 tickets the first time, then 2 tickets for each keg delivered. You can only do it once a day and you still have the 4 minutes limit, however you will get extra time everytime you deliver a keg and you can get 20~25 tickets each day with a decent route
You need to get a keg from Flynn Firebrew in Kharanos standing on a hill on the right of the road, next to the armory/Bok Dropcertain just follow the road to Razor Hills. Bring it back to the quest giver and do this 3 times, you can use the apples buckets to make it faster, but you can do without it.

Reward : [item=32233] Screenshot http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/reward_wolpertinger.jpg, This pet is actually invisible to other players
The point here is to ... drink, drink, and drink again. Buy wine from the wine vendor or anything else and drink until you feel completely smashed. The emotes will appear in this order : You feel tipsy > You feel drunk > You feel completely smashed. When you're smashed, you will be able to see the Wolpertinger for about 10 seconds, then they will disappear and you will have to drink again to make them reappear. This is how they look like when you're very drunk http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/wolpertingerdrunk.jpg or like this http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/wolpertinger.jpg if you don't have full screen glow activated
