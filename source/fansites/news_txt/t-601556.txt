Boubouille2007-07-20, 07:19 AMPremade character copies are now available for the 2.2 PTR.

You can access them at this page:
http://test.worldofwarcraft.com/ptr/character-copy.html http://test.worldofwarcraft.com/ptr/character-copy.html

Have fun and be sure to report any bugs that you encounter in the new build.

As the pre-made characters are level 70 and start in the Outlands, The Burning Crusade expansion is required to utilize them.

All characters come with a full tier 6 equipment and ... [item=23162,en,us] bags. 
Nothing for the EU Players yet, but we can assume that it will be activated today or tomorrow.

Yes, premades may be back soon, just be a bit more patient, I know it's not easy, but we are investigating the issue.
