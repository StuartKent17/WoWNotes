Addons - AtlasLoot v6.00.00 Released
The latest version of AtlasLoot  has been released and is now fully updated for Cataclysm. 

Most importantly, the new Cataclysm client changed how items are stored in the client and you no longer have to wait for the item to be active on your server to have it displayed properly in AtlasLoot. The current version of Atlasloot should get you a decent list of most of the items you will get in the expansion and you should be able to check most of them in-game with the proper drop location, ability to try them out in the dress-up room, etc...
