(Update : Fixed, lack of sleep this morning.)<br>
Warlocks are getting one of their set changed on the PTR again. This time, it&apos;s the Tier 6 2-Parts bonus. <br>
New Bonus : Each time one of your Corruption or Immolate spells deals periodic damage, you heal 70 health.<br>
Old bonus : Each time one of your Corruption, Curse of Agony, Immolate, or Unstable Affliction spells deals periodic damage, you heal 35 health.<br>
<br>

Orc Shoulders<br>
A few people were worried because they couldn&apos;t see the orc shoulders changes mentionned in the PTR Patch notes. Don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s indeed fixed. <br>
Someone pulled the art from a current build instead of a future one where the shoulder art is fixed. I&apos;ll see if they can update it.<br>

I am Murloc<br>
I forgot to mention it yesterday, but if you can&apos;t get the &quot;I Am Murloc&quot; video from the Blizzard downloader, I mirrored it on Rapidshare (http://rapidshare.com/files/43386718/I_am_Murloc_US.avi)</div></div>
