Before you can harbor any hope of defeating the Iron Horde, you must first understand what—and whom—you’re up against. Our five-part series Lords of War introduces you to some of the major players in the campaign on Draenor—beginning with the sadistic Kargath Bladefist, leader of the Shattered Hand, and continuing today with the mighty Grommash Hellscream, chieftain of the Warsong clan.

Grommash Hellscream’s legend was not born from mere brutality or conquest. His indomitable will helped him survive the impossible . . . but only after his recklessness nearly cost him everything.

Once you’ve watch his story, visit our newly posted Grommash Hellscream character page http://battle.net/wow/game/lore/characters/grommash-hellscream to read more about his legacy and his role in the events to come.

Visit www.worldofwarcraft.com in the weeks to come for more episodes of Lords of War, and arm yourself with the knowledge you need to survive the battle ahead.
