Development Time Tradeoffs<br>
That said, their constant &quot;...at the cost of a raid tier...&quot; excuse is getting old. We should just call their bluff and say sacrifice the raid tier and give us race-specific buildings for our garrisons.<br>
It&apos;s just a handy reference to explain the level of resources required to do some of the things that might be requested. As has been evidenced by this thread, it seems that when we say that, it can (amazingly) be misconstrued. <br>
<br>
I know it&apos;s easy to envision Blizzard as a mysterious Willy Wonka-esque magic factory where unfathomable entities craft limitless wonders. As cool (disturbing?) as it would be if we had a bunch of orange-skinned green haired gnomes running around to do our bidding, we don&apos;t (but we&apos;re working on it). In the meantime, there are real people working long hours with mouse, keyboard, and tablet to bring those wonders to life. It&apos;s hard work, and it&apos;s held up to an exacting standard. <br>
<br>
The long and the short of it is that when we say that, we&apos;re not necessarily literally saying that &quot;It&apos;s this or a raid tier&quot;. It&apos;s just shorthand for the amount of resources it might require to accomplish something. It&apos;s more like: &apos;this&apos; or &apos;more content elsewhere in the game&apos;. Some of you mentioned that you want 5-mans. Well, then the question becomes: Do you want a set of Garrison buildings for one new race or a 5-man? Or a new questing zone? Or new creatures, items, and gear? Or, indeed, a raid tier? So on and so forth. <br>
<br>
It&apos;s merely an expression of equivalent effort to get across a point that no matter how many creative people we have working, we are always only be able to accomplish so much with those specific resources in a specific amount of time. And that means we have to prioritize what we do. We have to know when to call a project done, and move on to something else, and when to delay an &apos;Oh, that would be cool if&apos; for later. Feature creep is a real thing, and it can cause an entire project to end up on the cutting room floor.<br>
<br>
The quality and detail Blizz is using going into garrisons doesn&apos;t hold up with existing buildings that would just be copy pasted on, even if it was as easy as just copy pasting general racial buildings into a system like garrisons, which I highly doubt.<br>
Correct. We want building and running a Garrison to be a fun and engaging experience, and we&apos;re not down with kludging features together. If we do something at all, we always try to do it right.

Art<br>
any winged Arakkoa concepts yet? Will we not see them until 6.1 or 6.2? Doesn&apos;t seem like you had anything at @BlizzCon<br>
working on them right now - will probably release some shots in Artcraft blog when they&apos;re ready to show. No eta (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/428585685952389120))<br>
<br>
If / when you have the time, can you read through this thread? http://t.co/40DOD3XmD7<br>
read the article, happy with male Worgen and aware that female isn&apos;t working for large portion of players. No ETA but on radar (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/428549768575348736))<br>
<br>
will male night elves look more proportionate,i mean their waist is too small,will it be a bit wider? it&apos;d be cool!! btw <br>
silhouette will remain, but texture work should help support it as a stylistic choice rather than a mistake, if that makes sense (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/428254896911945728))<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br>
Will mop items w/ hit/exp. in 6.0 convert to mast/haste/crit, not WoD stats? Could increase SoO-Amplify-Trinkets&apos; value.<br>
Yeah, hit/exp will convert to crit, haste, or mastery. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427526670262616064))<br>
WIll items be converted by a rule of thumb? Like &quot;always turn hit-&gt;crit (unless item already has it, then haste)&quot; for example<br>
No, I believe we do a mixture. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427528474660581376))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
While on that subject, any chance for &quot;flex raiding&quot; to include tanks? IE, mechanics that cater to 1-3 tanks or similar.<br>
Unlikely. This is very difficult to do, and would require very significant mechanical changes to a fight. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427015571398340608))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Does PVP power work while on the Timeless Isle?<br>
Yes will always work against another player unless in a raid instance. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/427162376496877568))<br>
<br>
Clarification on Krasarang rares?: first time they are killed in the day by a given character or by anyone?<br>
Each character gets once per day (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/427162188285894656))<br>
<br>
Question for : Do you know which bracket is the most used in arena ? Thought it was 2v, but not really sur about that.<br>
yes it is 2s (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/428550723559645184))<br>
<br>
Any news/ideas on what the Conquest &gt; Gold conversion rate will be in 5.4.7<br>
Same as usual. Conquest converts to honor. Honor capped at 4k. 35 silver for each point of honor over 4k. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/427540226999738368))<br>
<br>
is world pvp going to be a little more balanced next season? tired of being legit 2 shot by pve heroes and hearing how bad i am<br>
The PvP gear has a significantly higher item level so it should be very competitive in World PvP (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/428054785997041664))<br>
<br>
UI / Addons<br>
will white crit number become large again?nowdays when auto attack crit the numbers are still smal i want my big white numbers<br>
No, that was an intentional change. The abilities you use are intended to be the exciting numbers; white hits are typically weak. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427014469563060224))<br>
What does it matter to you if some players liked it that way btw ? :&apos;( More options is always a good thing !<br>
On the contrary, more options is definitely not *always* a good thing. More confusion, overwhelming, missed by most,. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427022639316467712))<br>
Instead, we support custom addons, so that you and other players can make it work however you want. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427022809655554048))<br>

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/gb-en.png Free Character Migrations Available<br>
If you&apos;re on one of the source realms listed below, you can move your characters to one of the designated destination realms and avoid the queues&#x2014;for free!<br>
<br>
By initiating one of these transfers, you will be moving your character to a new realm and home. This is a one-time, one-way move. If you wish to move your character elsewhere, you will need to use the paid transfer service.<br>
<br>
<br>
Draenor / Silvermoon =&gt; Kilrogg / Stormrage<br>
Kazzak / Outland / Ragnaros / Stormscale / Sylvanas / Twisting Nether =&gt; Grim Batol / Auchindoun<br>
<br>
<br>
Please be aware that, due to the unpredictable nature of free transfers, we may close down any Free Character Migrations at any time and without warning if the target realm becomes full. If you plan to move with friends or your guild, we suggest that you coordinate the effort to reduce the chance of any stragglers being left behind.<br>
<br>
Early closures aside, this set of Free Character Migrations will end on Tuesday, February 18.<br>
<br>
Begin a Free Character Migration now (https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/fcm/character-list.html?r=EU&amp;l=WoW1)! We recommend reviewing the FAQ (https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/free-character-migration), as it details what is or isn&apos;t allowed for transferred characters.<br>
