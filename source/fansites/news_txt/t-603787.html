A few more item changes were spotted on PTRs, it was a bit hard to find enough of them to make a news about it but 4 new undocumented changes are enough I guess. <br>
[item=34220] now requires at least 2 blue gems instead of exactly 2.<br>
[item=7189] now requires Engineering (225).<br>
You can now stack up to 20 [item=24268] (was 10 before)<br>
[item=33865] aren&apos;t bind on pick up anymore. <br>
Reminder - [item=34622] has been nerfed (see screenshot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/november/spinesev23.jpg))<br>
Other 2.3.2 changes are available in this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=2506.0)<br>

Website downtime<br>
The site will probably be down for about an hour today to upgrade the servers, the maintenance will start at 10:00AM EST Time. Hopefully it will prevent most of the crashes we experienced in the patch during patch days, which means less time wasted to keep the site alive, and more time to post news on patch days !<br>
<br>

Servers maintenance explanation<br>
There isn&apos;t any interesting blue post about the game today, but I thought it might be a good idea to report this long post from Drysc explaining why maintenances are scheduled the way they are. <br>
I won&apos;t go into the technical nature of &quot;why&quot; we have Tuesday maintenance, I think that&apos;s better answered at another time and by someone more qualified than myself, but that didn&apos;t seem to be your real question anyhow.<br>
<br>
The reason why we take down all realms at the same time is because it&apos;s quicker, it doesn&apos;t restrict some realms more than others, and it doesn&apos;t force players to swamp other realms that are up. If anyone remembers some of the larger issues we had back a couple years ago or so, when a realm or group of realms go down, everyone on those realms would converge on a single realm and more or less grief the entire population of that realm. Not fun for the original players of that realm. It&apos;s quicker because the maintenance can take a while, and doing one group of realms at a time would mean some group of realms, or multiple groups, would not be available near or during prime time, and we like to avoid that whenever possible of course.<br>
<br>
We have made some great improvements though in our maintenance times, and we&apos;re now able to schedule rolling restarts every other week which only require realms to be down for 15 minutes or so. We&apos;re continuing to refine the process, and make improvements where possible.<br>
<br>
We attempt to schedule for a time when most people are asleep and/or at school or work. For those that have neither, think of Tuesday like a sorbet, cleansing the gaming palette and allowing you to focus on getting some of your day-to-day things done. Water the gourds, wash your stuffed hawk-catching-a-mouse diorama, eat frozen peas, take your Orange GoJo &quot;shower&quot;... you know, really just spend time on the normal stuff for a while.<br>

Thebronzekettle.com Charity Raffle<br>
Thebronzekettle.com (http://www.thebronzekettle.com/?page_id=66) is organizing a Charity Raffle in partnership with Child&apos;s play (http://www.childsplaycharity.org/), how could you refuse an occasion to potentially win WoW prizes and do something nice at the same time ? Information and donation links are available on Thebronzekettle.com (http://www.thebronzekettle.com/?page_id=66)<br>
<br>
How does it work?<br>
For every $1 that you donate to Child&#x2019;s Play (http://www.childsplaycharity.org/), you get 1 chance out of the total number of dollars donated. So if 50 people each donate $2, everyone will have a 2/100 or 2% chance to win a prize. Numbers will be assigned based on the influx of the payments, so if you are 1st person to donate and you donate $5. You will respectively be assigned numbers 1-5. The next person to donate $1 gets number 6 and so on.<br>
<br>
How are winners chosen?<br>
Winners will be chosen online and during a scheduled in-game event. We will /random 1-X (where X is the total $ donated) to determine the winners. You won&#x2019;t have to be present to win but it would be awesome if we could get as many people as possible to show up. (Level 1 alts ftw). We&#x2019;ll post more details about the event soon.<br>
<br>
What are the prizes?<br>
Each winner gets to choose 1 of the remaining prizes (1st winner gets first choice) until all the prizes have been exhausted. It&#x2019;s possible to win multiple prizes but not for the same entry. Example: if we roll a 4 and a 5, and the same person is assigned those entries, then they will win two prizes. If we roll 2 4&#x2019;s in a row, the person only gets one prize. So as of right now: the prizes include the following (multiples will be offered as separate prizes):<br>
Transmogrification of Your Character (http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2284/1920626565_3c26b181e2_o.jpg) (the same as our previous auctions) x 2<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ve got plans to procure more prizes before the raffle ends. If you have anything you&#x2019;d like to donate as prize please contact us. It doesn&#x2019;t have to be artsy or crafty, pre-paid WoW time cards (http://www.amazon.com/World-Warcraft-Pre-Paid-Time-Card/dp/B00063BLG8) are always a big hit. Just make sure that its appropriate.<br>
<br>
When does it end?<br>
The raffle is currently slated to end on Friday the 14th. This will hopefully give us enough time to get prizes out before the holiday.<br>
<br>
What else?<br>
All that donate will be listed on our site with their donation amount (with permission). Entries are NOT limited to the US, Canada, or anywhere for that matter. We will be paying all Paypal processing fees and standard shipping costs. Express shipping details can be worked out on a per instance basis (overnight to Singapore can be costly). If your state/country considers participating in a raffle gambling, we will not be held responsible for any issues that may arise because of that.<br>
