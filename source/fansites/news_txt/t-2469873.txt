Patch 8.1.5 Will Drop on March 12th
During our live coverage of the art stream earlier, Blizzard stated that Patch 8.1.5 will go live on March 12th. Several new additions will be made to the game at this point, the most notable of which is the ability to finally play as a Kul Tiran Human or Zandalari Troll.

Is there an actual date yet for when Zandalari and Kultirans will be available finally?
I know itâ€™s been a bit of a wait, especially for the Zandalari folks, but we just mentioned on the live stream that is diving into the art of WoW that it is the week of March 12.

Is that patch 8.1.5 or just the new races?
The Kul Tiran and Zandalari Allied Races are part of the 8.1.5 content update.
