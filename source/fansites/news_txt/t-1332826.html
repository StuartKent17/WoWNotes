Classes<br>
what 3 spell abilities do you feel were spread too much? imo:1. MS 2. Pets 3. CC (close with dots).<br>
For me, 1. MS, 2. Interrupts, 3. Cast while moving. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/368445973896261632))<br>
<br>
Do you think that now that classes have similar toolkits, players fixate on small dps/hps deltas more now?<br>
Yes. 200% used to be the &quot;unacceptable&quot; delta. Then it became 30%. Now maybe 10% or less. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366286379090575360))<br>
<br>
Why are warrior/DK buffs still 5 min duration? Other class buffs are always-on passives or 60 mins. There a reason?<br>
They also provide resources so the intent is supposed to be you use them fairly frequently. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/368393111958863872))<br>
Isn&apos;t this just adding to bloat? A 5-min standard buff, even granting resources, is just another bind. Does it add flavor?<br>
We could turn all buffs into passive like Trueshot Aura. Is that better for the game? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/368447726976921600))<br>
<br>
We know, now we are just scared that this will be nerfed. As last time you buffed swp it did not last too long.<br>
The trick is not to view in progress patch notes as final. You can&apos;t lose something you technically never had. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367874432213073920))<br>
<br>
While I understand different healers are ok to have different reliance on spirit, how far do you think that should go?<br>
The less Spirit users should not be able to just stack throughout stats and then outheal the more Spirit users. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367874122136571904))<br>
<br>
You have the numbers. I&apos;m sure there&apos;s more than MM too. No reason to bring a SP vs a mage/lock in 5.2 progression though.<br>
Mage and lock ended up being too good in 5.2. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367386113125523456))<br>
<br>
Why? Valid argument is valid by definition. Tell us what to focus on. Millions of players, use us to make your job easier.<br>
Players as a collective are always going to want more changes than the game can handle. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366718960504274944))<br>
Would you be excited about 200 pages of patch notes for 5.4? As a player, I would find that really intimidating. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366719051638120448))<br>
And typically you can&apos;t just focus on your class. You often need to know how other classes changed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366719132319744000))<br>
So even when arguments are good, we&apos;re often not going to make a change unless we think it&apos;s pretty important. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366719263421116416))<br>
<br>
Then why did Warlocks get such massive changes, then? Constantly hearing &quot;Hunters are fine&quot; from the devs gets old.<br>
It was an experiment. Warlocks consistently among the least popular classes. Wanted to see if big changes changed that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366713819185168384))<br>
Probably too early to tell still, but we&apos;re not sure it had much effect and we probably lost some locks over the changes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366713913192099841))<br>
One the other hand, hunters have consistently been among the most popular, so more risk if we overhauled them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366714043928543233))<br>
Consider we still get a fair amount of feedback that focus, ammo, min range and aspect changes were bad. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366714532384616449))<br>

Ooooo goodie!! ... Wait... Does it include any Feral stuff? You know since we&apos;re totally confused about what&apos;s going on!<br>
No major new Feral changes in the blog. ATM we also think their damage in 5.4 is also fine. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365938560399970305))<br>
<br>
Lore said you were planning on giving Spriests and Boomkins active mitigation abilities. Where is this ability?<br>
This was a miscomm somewhere along the line. We meant that mitigation was too high not that we wanted to swap passive for active. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365935804180213762))<br>
<br>
You had said you were getting rid of passive Dmg reduction in turn for cooldowns will balance get any? Barkskin is weak.<br>
No, we said we were getting rid of passive damage reduction on some of the ranged specs. They felt too tanky to us. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367810260834078720))<br>
(And we understand those of you playing those specs disagree.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367810374084485121))<br>
<br>
Instead of nerfing the Balance T16 4Set because we were being capped on SS procs, why not consider letting SS procs stack to N<br>
We considered that, but it procs so fast we thought you&apos;d never be able to burn through all the stacks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364952064389951490))<br>
<br>
Can you actually give some insight into the Balance change and whether you will compensate? to calm the masses.<br>
On the PTR we were seeing a rotation with almost no Starfire or Wrath usage. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367348191017971712))<br>

I&apos;m sorry if this was already answered but was readiness removal for hunters needed for pve or pvp reasons?<br>
In this case, both. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366278620961972224))<br>
<br>
(my reply was referring to general hunter nerfs i&apos;ve read about. not the idea about applying dot via arcane shot.)<br>
I just meant we&apos;re not thrilled with the idea of hunters bringing the perceived best MS if it&apos;s easy to apply from range. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364599751812984832))<br>
I don&apos;t get it. It&apos;s baked into warrior attacks why not bake it into hunter ones? what exactly is the diff?<br>
Range. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365568814290702336))<br>
given how many distance closers you&apos;ve given warriors (and melee in general) it&apos;s pretty easy for them to apply ms as well<br>
Good. It was originally their ability. If anyone needs the best MS, it should be warriors. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365946562234417154))<br>

Unlikely. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365949918864609280))<br>
<br>
on the subject of mages, an you guys come up with something better mastery wise for the next xpac? Thought passive dmg was bad<br>
What is a spec that you think has a good mastery? I ask bc some players want passive dps, while others want procy mechanics. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365949792293109760))<br>
<br>
is the reasoning for fire nerfs to force us to play another spec because you &quot;worked so hard on frost mastery&quot;.<br>
No. Fire&apos;s damage was just unacceptably high in our 5.4 testing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367377754485829632))<br>
Combustion was a good thing to hit since it causes such huge swings based on perfect timing and a little luck. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367377834416672768))<br>
I don&apos;t play Fire, so I have no axe to grind. You are aware that currently combustion is doing 100% of ignite dmg though ?<br>
Yeah, just a bug. It isn&apos;t worth delaying every PTR build until we catch every bug, or we&apos;d release far fewer. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367808214122778624))<br>
<br>
I mean I get how insanely hard fire is to balance without killing lower ilvls. Maybe time for a redesign?<br>
As I mentioned in the blog, we have concerns about Critical Mass and AT + Combustion that we&apos;d like to solve eventually. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367376331182309376))<br>

The reason paladins are so high is borked scaling. Too weak at low or no vengeance but OP at high veng. Examine.<br>
We don&apos;t really see them weak at low V and only a problem in &quot;I&apos;ll tank it all mode&quot; which should be fixed now. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364610684836773888))<br>

It feels like the EF mastery nerf was intended to redirect us to SH or SS but it&apos;s ending up as a mastery nerf instead<br>
We&apos;d be open to buffing mastery. We don&apos;t like the gameplay of using a hot to constantly refresh it though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367374337080176640))<br>
<br>
It has felt like we&apos;ve been given tools then had them arbitrarily taken away because of a vision we don&apos;t have access to<br>
You have EF. We just thought the interaction between EF and mastery was a bit degenerate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367376969949655040))<br>
Which is why I have a hard time with the &quot;now paladins don&apos;t have an identity because we can&apos;t roll bubbles with hots.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367377088296124416))<br>
My hope is that anyone who has stuck with us for very long would understand why that violated our design intent on many levels. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367377257624379393))<br>

Again we hear that EF doesn&apos;t fit the style you want for holy without saying what style you want. Help?<br>

I have no reason to doubt you. Still, 10-man is the majority of groups, and atm shadow doesn&apos;t fit well.<br>

In 10s lots of Rets went Prot b/c Prot is OP w/ same gear. Look at diff in Ret representation between 10s and 25s.<br>

In my dreams I see SW:P buffs and castable-while-moving Mindflays. I&apos;m so happy here in my dreams, but is it time to wake up?<br>
SW:P is a good place to buff if we conclude they need it. Mind Flay on the move would be too good. You&apos;d be very mobile. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365940502127841284))<br>
We could do a Spiritwalkers treatment, but really everyone with Spiritwalkers is just more class homogenization. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365940620973449218))<br>

Agree moving Flay is too good. Maybe turn Spike into a shadowy Scorch/Fel Flame?<br>
Possibly, but does every caster need a Scorch analogue like every melee has a Kick clone? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365982595105816576))<br>
Overall, we&apos;re worried we have been too kind with the &quot;but I need X ability&quot; to the point of class over-similarity. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365982889835368448))<br>
I guess as long as you refrain from strengthening class niches people are going to ask for equal tools<br>
But if class niches are too strong, that&apos;s not cool either. Leads to class stacking etc. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365994056213463042))<br>

How do you make FDCL useful for movement without just beating Insanity all the time? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364529754524762112))<br>
Sp community quiet because a lot of them were asked to go disc.Shadow utility and dps in bad place<br>
Skeptical. Shadow is one of the most popular DPS specs for raiding. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365274471315156995))<br>
Rep doesn&apos;t tell you everything but it can help tell if someone is being benched. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365274668904615940))<br>
So we have to be underrepresented before you consider bringing Shadow on par (Single Tar.) with other casters?<br>
I was just arguing against the questionable claim that we get little Shadow feedback because they were all asked to respec. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365567145763016704))<br>
I guess because most Theorycrafters addressed you once and then said &quot;He has the data, his move.&quot; instead of mass QQing.<br>
Shadow vs. e.g. hunters or Elemental in 5.2. looks pretty good. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365600291065839616))<br>
And we believe the data suggests Shadow is competitive except against locks and mages, whose DPS is too high. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365600190662590464))<br>
You keep saying lock and mage dps is too high yet you do nothing to adjust that. You might aswell buff Shadow.<br>
If we hotfix buffs to everyone else, then you can suddenly beat all the content quickly and there is no progression. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365940060639596544))<br>
If we hotfix nerfs to outlier specs, it risks a group being unable to beat a boss they previously had on farm. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365939979463045120))<br>
Obviously those are two extremes and we do make adjustments despite the risks, but we want to be careful. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365940157649657857))<br>
<br>
Neither do I. I&apos;ve never said broken, just +10% undertuned vs our direct raid spot competition.<br>
Priests looking for more competitive damage in 5.4 should be happy. The ones with long lists of mechanic redesigns will not. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365949000479817728))<br>
<br>
So its main reason why Shadow just ignored? I like shadow but you force me to reroll<br>
If you think Shadow is horribly flawed, you&apos;re likely looking for something different out of the spec than we are. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365568166836965377))<br>
When you completely gut a spec in PvP and give no compensation, Expect a plethora of tweets and complaints.<br>
Shadow is performing really well in PvP. We don&apos;t see the 5.4 nerfs as gutting. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365936059885948928))<br>

Lore said you were planning on giving Spriests and Boomkins active mitigation abilities. Where is this ability?<br>
This was a miscomm somewhere along the line. We meant that mitigation was too high not that we wanted to swap passive for active. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365935804180213762))<br>
<br>
Why play shadow when everything else has an advantage over it. Those who played it for years tell you and u brush them off.<br>
It&apos;s one of those cry wolf deals where we hear so regularly how all 34 specs are doomed that it just becomes background noise. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365929757042413569))<br>
FWIW, the most common mistakes we see are downplaying your own spec&apos;s advantages or comparing yourself to an overpowered spec. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365929933396115459))<br>
<br>
Oh, is this like WotLK where you infamously said &quot;Shadow is fine.&quot; yet had to give them a huge buff next patch?<br>
We haven&apos;t finished our 5.4 tuning. I&apos;m not sure what you&apos;re arguing about. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365601661625962496))<br>

what was wrong with the SW: D change? i played with it on the ptr and it made execute so smoother i almost cried of happiness<br>
There was more backlash than we expected. If changes are controversial and not critical then we have to be careful. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365569231238070272))<br>
<br>
No other caster class has the ramp up time of shadow; orb generation precombat will not hurt any more than it has for balance?<br>
We&apos;d kill it for Balance if it was easy. If the intent was to start fully loaded, we&apos;d have them generate out of combat. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364607577906085888))<br>

Binding recuperate to a single spec would be very bad news for rogues <br>
Remember, that was a totally off the cuff example of how rogues could change. It&apos;s nowhere near an announcement, (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364600329142153216))<br>
Not sure it would be Sub only, but we heard lots of feed that it was cool when Sub used it a lot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364600211810689024))<br>
Misunderstood your post. It was interesting to utilize another finisher. Being forced 2 keep Slice/Recup up sucked<br>
Yeah, for sure. One pitch is to parcel out Rupture, SnD and Recup, but maybe that is still too similar of a maintain X feel. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364879254690865153))<br>
How about,all specs keeps slice and rupture, but focus on adding exciting moves with short cooldowns,or limited use?<br>
So many rogues complain about SnD maintenance that giving them an opt out would be nice. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364956951731376128))<br>

One question: Why 10 seconds on Evasion now?<br>
We thought the &lt;100% was too RNG (you can almost count on it but not quite). But the duration at 100% felt too long with Prep. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364616156033720320))<br>
<br>
And you are happy with rogue population too, cause thay are falling down??? Changes need to hapen cause thay are outdated...<br>
They have been dropping almost since launch. We&apos;ve looked at the issue a lot, and two things seemed to hasten the decline. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364607997525237760))<br>
First, it became harder to gank someone from stealth in the world. Second, we introduced DKs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364608115733315584))<br>
In any case, we&apos;re not sold on the idea that overhauling rogues leads to a population increase. Not sure that worked for locks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364608281454452736))<br>

Looking at the 1st round of DPS tuning: Are you guys intending assassination to shine again in execute range? If so, thanks!<br>
Partially, but really just Assassination was lower than intended on 5.4. I&apos;m not sure I can explain why that is relative to 5.3. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367369914341793792))<br>

Hey, was healing on my shaman again on PTR. Could you please rethink stacking Earth Shields?! Huge QoL issue, seems outdated.<br>
The effectiveness of healing (the first part) applies to any Earth Shield, not just yours. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364851984647462912))<br>

I don&apos;t get why shamans were the only class to get all nerfs and no buffs this update...I feel a tad sick right now.<br>
You&apos;ll be fine. If that&apos;s your reaction to patch notes, you might be obsessing about patch notes a smidge too much. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367873927822860288))<br>
<br>
Then revert the healing rain change. Pretty sure that falls under the &quot;but mah niche&quot; buff section<br>
The problem for Shaman was that they had big weaknesses in ranged or movement fights. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367375591126728704))<br>
We&apos;d rather offset a weakness (assuming it isn&apos;t debilitating) rather than remove that weakness. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367375683518869504))<br>
<br>
Concerning Stormblast and Elemental Blast, why not give them the Colossus Smash treatment instead of affecting sustained PVE?<br>
We were concerned about Elemental DPS being too high in PvE as well. The numbers aren&apos;t final though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367808643900522496))<br>
Im pretty sure he meant enhance. But it still seems odd when he did that coffee break thing saying enhance was fine<br>
Sorry for the confusion, but it applies to both shaman DPS specs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367841986645987328))<br>
Explain going from &quot;we think shamans are fine in pve&quot; and then nerfing them almost immediately nerf them to that extent?<br>
More raid testing happened. I was careful to caveat in the blog that 5.4 hadn&apos;t yet shipped and nothing was set in stone. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367871857946394625))<br>
<br>
Hey GC please reassure me the Enhancement tweaks are bad data mining by MMOC ?<br>
No, their damage was too high in both PvP and PvE. We nerfed SS largely because there have 30 different damage sources. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367372168885059585))<br>

I think the Warlock KJC flip-flop inspired this round. You guys were so set and then reverted it after outcry.<br>
Not really. We listened to arguments and made some changes. 5.4 KJC is not 5.3 version. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366278491915825152))<br>

any chance breath does dmg? get rid of void ray? back it in as a dot into old style sflame? goes with the tier talents kinda.<br>
If it does damage, then locks will feel like they are supposed to squeeze it into their rotation somehow. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/368448977873563648))<br>

remove heroic strike coz now specially after hamstring buff its useless , remove Op stack , stacking op is really boring.<br>
HS may not have a role for Arms anymore. Fury and Prot use it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365930300565495808))<br>
Why the push to remove HS all the sudden? Unless you make Slam take its place, HS IS essential to rage managemt<br>
Only for brief periods IMO. Usually it was at X gear level, you now have rage to spam HS as well as your normal rotation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365950991004213248))<br>
We think more rage management is more fun, but we have to balance that with players who want to fill every GCD. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365951198261547008))<br>
If you are GCD limited it&apos;s hard to also be resource limited. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365951251420164097))<br>
But without HS, at those X gear levels, you&apos;d have no way to bleed that rage. Would feel bad to sit at 100 rage all the time.<br>
Not disagreeing. I&apos;m saying rage management needs to be a core piece of gameplay not something you gear out of. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365953505535598594))<br>
Before the MoP rage changes, warriors were rage starved until X, then overpowered and felt understandably they had earned it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365953771651612673))<br>
But then it sucked to be a warrior before X, and sucked to be everyone else after. Not a stellar design. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365953906724966401))<br>
Due to the HR glyph, using Shield Block is defensively AND offensively best. HS is in a pretty dire spot.<br>
We&apos;d agree but there are several examples of this when we considered tank dps more optional so made glyphs for it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365992920655986689))<br>
The logic is that survival glyphs are mandatory, but these days tank dps is Kind of a Big Deal, so they aren&apos;t optional either. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365993068081582080))<br>
<br>
coz its not Op , or buff Ms damage , slam is not the way to make warrior good , it will hurt pvp and pve for most , you like .<br>
It&apos;s tough with Arms (PvE and PvP) to keep either OP or Slam from being ignored. With more OP dmg you might not Slam at all. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365930615494803457))<br>
But if Slam does too much damage, you just save all rage for it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365930674085040130))<br>
<br>
Is it possible to just see Sunder Armor become a part of CS for 5.4? I don&apos;t think I have pushed this button all xpac.<br>
Not for 5.4 but maybe eventually we&apos;ll just merge it with Devastate and CS. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367874251501490176))<br>
<br>
I like the concept of Meat Cleaver. It&apos;s just that Cleave has no part in our AOE rotation. Too much rage cost, too little dmg.<br>
We could cut Cleave and just let you WW and RB. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367385904739926016))<br>
<br>
Most warriors I know don&apos;t have it on their hotbar even. Second point: Fury aoe feels clunky at best. Anything to smooth it up<br>
Hmm. We really like Fury AE. Meat Cleaver is fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367368443491659777))<br>
<br>
So, how serious were you about removing Cleave? I&apos;d think only prot warriors would complain as they actually use it.<br>
It&apos;s an iconic spell and one warriors have had forever, but if it is superfluous, it&apos;s hard to justify. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367810519387738112))<br>
<br>
making Thunder Clap have no CD for Prot would solve everything, allow us to get agro on pack of mobs all the time<br>
So would a no CD Challenging Shout, but we don&apos;t want to take all the skill out of tanking. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367348642740314112))<br>
you mean mocking banner.cause banner doesnt fixate big adds and bosses. again.fixate not taunt.<br>
No, I actually meant CS. The idea is to give tanks tools and let them use them, not to make it trivial to do anything. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367374714525589506))<br>
Back when threat control was trickier, there was a place for CS. These days threat is easy. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367374830099640320))<br>

<br>
Can I ask why, when Arms Warriors need sustained damage buffs, you buff slam and not MS/OP?<br>
Common feed we hear is all the attacks feel about the same. We think Slam can hit harder w/out the rotation just being Slam spam. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367346498171711488))<br>
DW buff = sustained damage. BTW I&apos;ve always thought OP should be free, Slam as rage dump with HS emergency rage dump<br>
OP didn&apos;t work well as free because it let warriors ignore all rage generation but MS. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367369330758938624))<br>
<br>
Are you after a rotation where Slam is better than Overpower under Colossus Smash? Bank rage for SD so HS dies?<br>
I wouldn&apos;t use HS much as Arms unless you need a hit ASAP for some reason or have tons of rage from e.g. Zerk stance. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367364383355043840))<br>
<br>
how do you intend Slam to function in the Arms rotation in 5.4?<br>
It does more damage during CS, so in PvE use it then. In PvP you can use it anytime you need a big hit and have the rage. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367363686416912384))<br>
