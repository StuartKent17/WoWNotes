Raid Finder (and Mythic) difficulty for Crucible of Storms will open next week, April 23. Similar to Battle of Dazar&#x2019;alor, you will need an average item level of 350 to queue for it. To help ensure players get raid ready, we are increasing the maximum item level for certain World Quests rewards. This will include the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
World Quest rewards will go up to ilvl 370 (from 360)<br>
Emissary equipment will go up to ilvl 395 (from 385)<br>
Emissary Azerite Armor will go up to ilvl 400 (from 385)<br>
Against Overwhelming Odds (when available) will go up to ilvl 395 (from 385)<br>
<br>
<br>
Once the update is live it will affect active rewards like the Emissaries, so you may want to plan for when you will turn those in.<br>

Employee Alpha Testing for WoW Classic<br>
A few days ago we posted that the WoW Classic Beta was added to CDC (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8460-World-of-Warcraft-Classic-Beta-Added-to-CDN). It turns out that this was associated with the beginning stages of employee Alpha testing.<br>
Hey folks! I&#x2019;ve got a small update here to help quell some of the rumors and let you know where we are at for WoW Classic. We recently began a phase of internal employee alpha testing. The new build data that many of you have been discussing over the last few days is simply part of this process. Phases like this allow us to test out the game content along with other functionality that will be used in the live game, like logging in through the Blizzard Battle.net App.<br>
<br>
Aside from that, we don&#x2019;t have any announcements to make at this time. I know all of you are very excited about this game and we thank you for your patience as we continue to develop it. More information will be coming soon!</div></div>
