Battle.Net - Facebook Streaming
Tonight's Battle.Net Alpha update added the code to allow for users to stream to Facebook http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5747-Blizzard-Adding-Facebook-Login-and-Facebook-Live-Streaming.

We tested the quality with Hearthstone, but you can stream any of the games in the launcher. The quality isn't great, but keep in mind that this feature is not actually released or even active yet.

AskMrRobot - Legion Simulator
AskMrRobot has released a simulator to model Legion bosses and gameplay. You can read all of the details in their intro post http://blog.askmrrobot.com/2016/06/new-legion-simulator/ and help page http://blog.askmrrobot.com/simulator-help/.


Lots of the details of simulation are contained on a wiki for everyone to see and edit. 
This includes how spells work, how buffs interact, and the assumptions made in spell rotations.
The simulator will model every boss in Legion with multiple scenarios. 
Simulation setups can be shared and modified. 
Currently every DPS spec is implemented with basic rotations, most Legion gear is added, and web based simulations are available. 
In the future a client is coming so that more intensive simulations can be run locally, batch simulations, distributed simulations, stat weight generation, and more.

Raid Testing Schedule - June 24-27
Within a few hours, we will be opening the first Raid Finder wing of the Emerald Nightmare. We'll leave it open over the weekend.

On Monday, June 27, we will continue our Legion Mythic raid testing.

Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Mythic, of course, requires 20 and does not scale.

Monday, June 27

Chronomatic Anomaly - Mythic Nighthold
13:30 PDT 16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST

Trilliax - Mythic Nighthold
15:00 PDT 18:00 EDT, 00:00 CEST

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.


FEEDBACK: Darkbough Raid Finder
The first week of the Emerald Nightmare raid is now open in Raid Finder, containing Nythendra, Il'gynoth, and Elerethe Renferal. Players level 100+ may queue, and players' level and item level will be scaled accordingly.

Please use this thread for any feedback on mechanics, clarity, tuning, bugs, etc.

Legion Transmog
Cudgel of the Warmaster. The lfr appearance shows up in my appearance tab as not collected. As far as I know dragon soul lfr weapons not from deathwing never dropped on live servers and this is an unobtainable item. I mean, if you're gonna have them start dropping from DS LFR that's great, though.

Horn of Valor Nerf
Is it as intended for regular heroic horn of valor to have the same agility on use effect as a titanforged mythic horn? I have a titanforged and it feels so underwhelming to have the same agility on use as a heroic version.
This is a data bug and will be fixed in a future build. Thanks! Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/415167-horn-of-valor-mega-nerf/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20745754521?page=1#3

Fire Mage -- Legion Beta Feedback
There may still have to be some tuning on Phoenix Flames, once we see how the auto-crit fits into the rotation. Overall it's an effect we like, and part of the reason is that it helps stop Combustion from being the only correct time to use PF. But the 90sec recharge is too long--that will be reduced next build.

Enhancement Shaman Feedback -- Legion Beta Feedback
To clarify a few things:
--This build caught the middle of a few changes. Next build, Maelstrom Weapon will affect autoattacks and Windfury attacks. That should keep Windfury relevant to the rotation, but still leave Maelstrom generation lower than before which we found to be too high. In addition, there is no longer the confusing and unnecessary fact that Stormstrike and Lava Lash both spent and generated Maelstrom.
--There's no intended change to Feral Spirits; that's a tooltip bug.
--The rotation with Boulderfist is meant to be Maelstrom-limited i.e., it should have open GCD's, unlike the usual rotation. After Maelstrom Weapon is working properly, we'll see if the Boulderfist rotation is correct as far as pacing, and can tune the damage from there.
