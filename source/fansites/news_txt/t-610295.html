Yes, we&apos;re planning on speeding up leveling in the 60-70 range. Keep the feedback coming. We are still adjusting it. Let us know what levels you are in what areas in this bracket.<br>

Halls of Stone - Loot Table<br>
Finally, we&apos;ve got the first items dropping from the Halls of Stone (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=796) in Storm Peaks. This instance is tuned for LVL 77 to 79 players and will probably offer the first alternatives to Sunwell loot. The first weapon we discovered, Unrelenting Blade (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/wotlk/items/rare/rareitem_065.jpg) reaches 117 DPS and is bind on equip ! as a comparison [item=34329] drops on Kil&apos;jaeden and goes &quot;only&quot; as high as 114.2 DPS. <br>
