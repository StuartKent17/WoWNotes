Queen Azshara Hotfixes this Week<br>
We&#x2019;re working on the following hotfixes today. We intend to apply to these changes to the Queen Azshara encounter with weekly maintenance in each region:<br>
<br>
<br>
When either Aethenel or Cyranus is slain on Normal, Heroic, or Mythic difficulty, there is now a 3-second delay before the other one gains the Torment buff.<br>
Azshara&#x2019;s Indomitable is now summoned 10 seconds later than previously observed on Mythic difficulty.<br>
Tidemistresses have 5% less health on Mythic difficulty.<br>
Ancient Wards now energize slightly slower for smaller raid sizes on Normal and Heroic difficulties.<br>
Fixed an issue that allowed Arcane Vulnerability to apply when the victim wasn&#x2019;t in line of sight of Queen Azshara.<br>
<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll update this post if there are any further changes, and when the hotfixes go live.<br>
<br>
<br>
Season 3 Artifact Knowledge<br>
<br>
Is this being cut off soon?<br>
Or are you leaving it on indefinitely?<br>
<br>
No to both questions. <br>
<br>
As things currently stand, Artifact Knowledge will continue to increase each week until the week of October 1.</div></div>
