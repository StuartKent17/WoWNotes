Boubouille2007-03-21, 11:37 AMA hot fix has been deployed. Warbringer O'mrogg's burning maul ability now correctly lasts the intended amount of time, when playing Shattered Halls in heroic mode.


Lurker Below kill movie by Last Resort is now on the main page of warcraftmovies.com , since my servers are handling it fine, i can even advertise it in my news.


I'm working on a new version yup, again of the raid guides, this should be the last update to the old guides except the kharazan ones :/. This also means new guides soon ^^

I'll probably put a "Contact" page online soon to make it easier for people to send me news, informations, and insults.
