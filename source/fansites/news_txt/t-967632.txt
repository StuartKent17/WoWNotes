Patch 4.2.2 Official Notes
As I mentioned earlier this week, Patch 4.2.2 is now live and Blizzard posted the final version of the patch notes on the official site. This is mostly a hotfix consolidation patch without any game balance changes, see the datamined changes for details.

Battleground Win Ratios
I'll bring it up in our next developer meeting, but in all likelihood, since that could potentially dramatically impact queue times for random Battlegrounds, it probably won't fly.

[...] I said that there would be a greater emphasis on creating new Battlegrounds on the future. I should note that we're slowly working toward new technology to make the creation and modification of battlegrounds something we can do more readily too. 

I also might have made it sound like the older Battlegrounds will never change again. That's not what I meant to get across. We've redone AV several times throughout the years, and it may see more changes in the future. I just wanted to note that the emphasis is going to be shifted a bit, that's all.
