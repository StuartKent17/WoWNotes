For the moment, it only looks like PTR bugfixes, and most of you probably never noticed them. ^^<br>
<br>
Hunters<br>
The new aimed shot is here.<br>

<br>
Rogues<br>
The overpowered poison bug has been fixed. <br>
Warriors<br>
The stance bug has been fixed. (Switching from one stance, to the same stance)<br>
<br>
<br>
New PTR Build<br>
The news will be edited to list all the changes, but don&apos;t expect too many of them, we&apos;re 5 days away from the release.<br>
The PTR is being taken down to update to a new build. We expect the downtime to last between four and six hours.<br>
<br>
There are no new character copies, no new pre-mades, and no new patch notes.<br>

PvP<br>
Something might be added to the Armory to provide accurate indications of qualified team numbers for each bracket, and possibly if a team is currently qualified or not. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2766101883&amp;postId=28557408255&amp;sid=1#366))<br>

2.3 Patch<br>
Warrior shouts and some feral druid spells can&apos;t be casted for free after a resurrection in a BG, this is working as intended. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2856197212&amp;postId=28557112007&amp;sid=1#4))<br>
There is no plans for a free talent point reset in patch 2.3. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2856006807&amp;postId=28557410732&amp;sid=1#41))<br>
If you&apos;re doing well in Karazhan, you should be able to go right into Zul&apos;aman. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2856007253&amp;postId=28557410073&amp;sid=1#2))<br>

Wrath of the Lich King<br>
