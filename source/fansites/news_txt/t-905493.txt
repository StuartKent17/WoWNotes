Tier 12 Set Bonuses - Additional Information & Clarification
Additional Information & Clarification



The Fire damage-over-time effects from some set bonuses work like Ignite, and will accumulate and refresh damage just as it does.


The Mirror Image summoned by the http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage set 2-piece bonus does not cause him/her to drop threat. It summons a guardian who appears like the mage and casts Fireballs by his/her side.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage 4-piece bonus stats: +15% proc chance to Brain Freeze, +30% chance on single critical effect to Hot Streak, and Arcane Missiles will always proc by the 4th cast.


The http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue 4-piece bonus never picks hit or expertise, and never picks the same rating twice in a row.


The http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior 2-piece bonus gets its duration reduced based on the number of talent points the warrior has in Booming Voice. It lasts 12/9/6 seconds at 0/1/2 points spent in Booming Voice.


The http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter 4-piece bonus does not get consumed by shots that do not cost focus.

PTR Raid Testing Schedule 5/16-5/17
The next phase of raid testing is as follows:

Monday, May 16
EU 10:30 AM PDT - Alysrazor, 10 player
US 4:30 PM PDT - Alysrazor, 10 player

Tuesday, May 17
EU 10:30 AM PDT - Baleroc, 10 player
US 4:30 PM PDT - Majordomo Staghelm, 10 player

We will be testing on both EU and US PTR realms initially, with other regions to come later. 25 Player and Heroic testing will happen later in the PTR testing cycle.

As always, the schedule can change at a moment’s notice due to issues with the build, server, encounter, or the fickle, fickle nature of designers. The encounters are all a work in progress; there will be bugs and tuning is not final.

Fire Damage in Firelands
Creatures in the Firelands will not be immune to Fire damage. Giving raid mobs and bosses immunity to a school of magic just doesn't work well, given that some classes/specs are dependent upon the damage output from that school.

Instead, we've themed many of the set bonuses around the Firelands. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/175548/tier-12-set-bonuses-feedback / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2522434404?page=3#45

DPS classes never benefit from the Dungeon Finder CTA
We recognize it's not the most elegant solution. Ideally we wouldn't offer greater incentives to one player over another based purely on the class role they each fulfill. That said, the disparity in queue times was unacceptable in our eyes, and we saw that sentiment shared throughout the community.

Perhaps there are better ways for us to lower queue times without having to offer additional rewards to the class role in highest demand in the Dungeon Finder, but Call to Arms is a feature we were able to develop in a much more reasonable time frame.

Do we like that your only reward from the Call to Arms feature is a shorter queue time? No. But then, if the queue times were more equal for each class role, we wouldn't have added Call to Arms in the first place.Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/175494/how-is-it-fair-that-dps-never-get-ctas / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2522463654?page=5#83
