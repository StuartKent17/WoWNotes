Submit Questions for the Developers
We have our first interview in a long time coming up at Blizzcon and as always, we want to let the community ask questions! This time our interview will be covering the design of Legion.

If you have any questions you think we should ask, be sure to add them to the comments of the linked post http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1885061-Submit-Questions-for-the-Developers for consideration. We will pick the best questions and add them to our list! 


Don't post any questions in the comments of this news post. Use the linked topic http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1885061-Submit-Questions-for-the-Developers instead.
These should be questions about Legion, not Warlords of Draenor.
No class specific questions please. This includes things like balance between the different healing/tank/DPS classes and specs.

Any chance you're onstage for panels at BlizzCon this year Dave? Loved you the other year and hope to see you again this year!
None of the main stage panels, although I'll probably sit in on the voiceover panel again this year. Thank you! DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/653983375842131968

Character / Items
for my own sanity, could u pls confirm that droprate for Medallion of the Legion was not nerfed in 6.2.2? Not seen it in weeks
There have been no changes to its drop rate since Tanaan went live with 6.2. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/653746294226223104

Please fix Legendary Ring's explosion getting wasted during Soul Capacitor trinket procs.
How is it wasted? Your contribution should get captured and amplified further by Soul Capacitor. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/653746471238418432

PvE
why don't you let us use the repair mount in both Socrethar and Tyrant arenas?
In general, you can only mount outdoors â€“ those areas both are fully enclosed. Engineers can drop Jeeves wherever, of course. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/653746098297663488

PvP
So what did folks who played and watched think of 6v6? holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/653358937689862144
6v6 format works well, enjoyable to watch and looks like great fun to play. Few thoughts though... large buff icons on name plates is annoying, especially when you have players clumped up. possibly allow BL/TW in 6v6, hard for loser to comeback and this should help without being OP. possibly making some maps that suit 6v6, would be awesome.
Thank you for your thoughts. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/653415518196465665
I like objective based better than arena for sure. Matches can get decided a little early on control points however.
Yea control point maps play no better with 6 than they do with 10 sadly holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/653360882328571904

Have you considered 4v4?i mean why did you missed the 4s as bracket i can't see it being more unbalanced than 2s but can be fun tho
2 healers 2 dps. yuck holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/653363603190321152

Lore
Life Tap is surrounded by what seems to be fel energy, so my Q is: Is fel power converted life force?
The way I would describe it: Fel is chaotic energy. Warlocks convert life into fel, draining the victim as a source of power. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/654345020619689984

The most challenging part of game development is getting people to stop playing Overwatch. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/653629808908222464
