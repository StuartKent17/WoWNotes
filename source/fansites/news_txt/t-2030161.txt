chaud2016-07-18, 07:30 PMWardrobe and Transmogrification
Legion adds the Wardrobe system, allowing you to collect appearances without holding on to the items! 


Void Storage still exists and is unchanged.
You need to visit a Transmogrification NPC to hide your cloak, helm, or shoulders now. 
A new tab has been added to the collections pane, allowing you to browse all of the appearances wherever you are in game. 
You can filter by collected and uncollected appearances, as well as weapon types and appearance sources. 
You can save sets and apply them to all specs or just a specific spec, causing your transmog to change with your spec.
