Trading Card Mounts no longer Bind on Pickup in 3.2?<br>
Let me start this news with a small disclaimer, this information is absolutely NOT confirmed by Blizzard for the moment and I will not be responsible if you decide to do stupid things after reading it. <br>
<br>
While I was checking a few things on PTRs, a very interesting change showed up on my screen : the Spectral Tiger mount wasn&apos;t bound on pickup anymore. I decided to investigate a little more and realized that most of the TCG mounts had their bind removed. (Except for the turtle)<br>

<br>
I didn&apos;t want to news it earlier because it could have been a bug but apparently, the interface to redeem TCG codes was slightly changed and the Spectral Tiger mounts seem to have different codes for the normal and the swift version.<br>

<br>
Hopefully we&apos;ll hear from Blizzard about this very soon. <br>
