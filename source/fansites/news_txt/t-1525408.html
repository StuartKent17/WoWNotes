Warlords of Draenor - Tier 17 Paladin Armor Sets<br>
Today we are taking a look at the Tier 17 Paladin armor sets. <br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor changes things up slightly by using one set of art for Raid Finder, one set of art for Normal and Heroic, and one set of art for Mythic difficulty. You can find the plate Raid Finder armor set in our Raid Finder armor sets preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3940-Warlords-of-Draenor-Raid-Finder-Armor-Sets-Draenei-Guard-Armor-Set-Blue-Tweets-Art). <br>

Racials<br>
Will Touch of the Grave have its output adjusted for WoD? Most other racials scale up with gear, TotG is less than 0.5% atm<br>
Yes, tuning is likely to be adjusted. However, that&apos;s a common misconception. Other stats don&apos;t scale like you think. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469196504628867072))<br>
They do increase in value, but not like most people think. 1% crit is nearly half as valuable at 75% crit than at 5%. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469196817221967872))<br>

Why is the duration increase of Conductivity scaling negatively with haste not something that&apos;s been fixed yet?<br>
It doesn&apos;t scale negatively, it just doesn&apos;t scale positively. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468914449559326720))<br>
No - at 0% haste, it extends 4 seconds - at ~33% haste that drops to a 3 second extension<br>
It&apos;s X ticks that it adds. That stays constant. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468936175521374208))<br>
<br>
With the 4/4 upgrades I just hit 100.06% mastery on my elemental shaman - Is everything above 100% just wasted now?<br>
Yes, 100% Elemental Overload is the hard cap. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/469203763211669504))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
In WoD, if I decide to gear through Heroic Dungeons, will I be able to skip LFR and go straight to Normals?<br>
Yes. Gear from other sources may of course make it easier, but Normal Highmaul will be tuned for Heroic dungeon gear. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468915543601606656))<br>
I forget. Is Highmaul or Blackrock Foundry the entry raid like Mogu&apos;shan Vaults?<br>
Highmaul is the first raid. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468985978078904320))<br>
<br>
Can we get a deserter thing for Kicked Tanks from LFR? Tired of them running around acting like jerks and screaming Insta Queue.<br>
Now imagine a new tank who queues for LFR and gets kicked for not knowing a fight, and how Deserter on top of that would feel. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/469243286809366530))<br>
Definitely not a good solution, but something should be done about people who just hide behind Instant Queue to torture a group.<br>
No argument from me there. Social issues like that are something we discuss a lot. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/469253787001954304))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Why not just increase the damage taken by tank specs to 100%? Guardians will still be required by high rating teams.<br>
This isn&apos;t a roundabout way to exclude tanks from RBGs. Just felt their tuning hurt gameplay, so reigned it in a bit. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469164325119090688))<br>
<br>
Will tank specs have a place in arenas in 6.0? I missed being a protadin in 2&apos;s back in early cata. Hoping for a return!<br>
We&apos;ll be experimenting with some ideas in alpha. It may be necessary to say that tanks take extra damage in PvP. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469166791143354368))<br>
<br>
World<br>
I asked this way late last night but will Draenor be Cross Realmed like the world or will it be by itself like SW/Org/Pandaria?<br>
Like Pandaria works today, though you&apos;ll likely see some cross-server players that are in manually-formed groups. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/469172757901496320))<br>
