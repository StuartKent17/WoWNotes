We made many changes yesterday. A lot of these were bug fixes, and many bug fixes will affect damage one way or the other. So just because you don&apos;t see a specific change referenced below, doesn&apos;t mean it didn&apos;t change.<br>
<br>
With that said, here are the specific changes we made in reference to my previous post:<br>
<br>
1) We buffed the base points and coefficients of many warrior dps abilities. We didn&apos;t do as much to tanking abilities.<br>
<br>
We buffed the base points and coefficients of many Ret abilities.<br>
<br>
We buffed the base points and coefficients of many Feral cat abilities.<br>
<br>
2) We lowered the base points and coefficients of many mage abilities, but lowered Fire more than the other two.<br>
<br>
3) We nerfed Shadow Word: Death, but it is possible we didn&apos;t nerf it enough. It should not be Shadow&apos;s biggest spell.<br>
<br>
4) We returned Searing Pain&apos;s damage to its 3.3.5 levels.<br>
<br>
5) We increased the benefit of resilience by 50% for players level 80 and below. The tooltips will probably not reflect this change.<br>
<br>
We don&apos;t have any other changes to announce at this time. I am reluctant to mention additional classes or specs that we are looking at currently for fear of instilling excitement or panic.</div></div>
