A lot of providers flagged the email as spam because of how the email was built in the first place. The http://www.blizzcon.com/pet link doesn&apos;t point to blizzcon.com directly but redirects you to mailman.netcraft.co.il first, most likely for tracking purposes. If you don&apos;t feel safe clicking that link (even if it won&apos;t cause any problem) just type http://www.blizzcon.com/pet manually in your browser and redeem your code here. <br>

Grunty now available to stream viewers<br>
People who purchased the Blizzcon Stream from Rayv can now redeem their pet by following the instructions in the mail they received a few minutes ago. <br>
