Boubouille2007-04-06, 09:19 PMAeus gave more informations about EU Battlegroups qualifiers on the official forums.

We’ve seen some uncertainties about how the top 38 teams from Europe will be determined, and wanted to clarify that each Battlegroup will have a number of teams qualifying based on the size of the Battlegroup. 

There will be a minimum of one team qualifying from each Battlegroup, so even the smaller Battlegroups will be represented in the second qualifying round. 

More details on the qualifying rules will be posted soon.


If you're interested in the Arena Tournament, you should really check the Geekboys.org Arena Ranking  It's got a team ranking for each zone EU / US / KR for 2vs2 , 3vs3, and 5vs5 tournaments. 
There is also a nice option to check the world ranking for each class.
