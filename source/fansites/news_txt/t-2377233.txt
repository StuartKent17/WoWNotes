Blue Tweets
Buried within the data mines, a dark shadow stirs, its breath a bitter chill that brings with it promises of riches... and promises of destruction. A cry rings out, distant but clear. A signal of shock and fear, met with lost hope, and somehow... relief? We must dig deeper. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/963539905828700160


This Week in WoW History
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.

Break The Trees
Singer/songwriter Sharm was featured in a blue post after the release of her latest song “Break The Trees”. The verses of this song were comprised of talent names from Warcraft. Sharm has been creating WoW Parody videos for the past 10 years and is still active on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/user/taintedlore.

Iron Man Challenge
2012 marked the beginning of the Iron Man Challenge. This became one of the most popular challenges to date after a few players gave it a shot. The objective is simple - reach level cap. However, doing it within the confines of the rules is the difficult part. Players are not allowed to use and talents, class specializations, professions, enchants, stat-improved gear or the assistance of other players. The most important rule is that if your character dies at all the challenge is over.

Patch 5.4.7
This late Mists of Pandaria patch began the preparation for the new expansion Warlords of Draenor. The patch marked the beginning of the last PvP season of the expansion, added the Level 90 character boost, updated the launcher and added the Collector’s Edition mount/pet to the files.

Graphical Features
Patch 6.1 introduced a handful of new graphical settings to improve the quality of the game. Official colorblind support for Protanopia, Deuteranopia and Tritanopia were added along with a strength adjuster. The graphics tab also got a few new options including the addition of HBAO+ for screen space ambient occlusion SSAO, a variety of settings for Anti-Aliasing and improved point light settings.

Death Knight Animations
Patch 7.2 added new animations to Howling Blast, Death Grip and Death and Decay. A few undocumented changes were also made to the casting animations of abilities such as Remorseless Winter, Blood Boil and Apocalypse. The initial Death and Decay particles were also changed shortly after the update due to players having issues seeing the affected area when cast on certain terrain.

Going Casual
Top end mythic raiding in Legion, especially in the Nighthold, started to cause issues in certain guilds. The required time investment to stay at the top was too much, causing guilds to either go casual or stop raiding altogether. Most notably From Scratch and SNF announced that they would stop, while Midwinter also called it quits after defeating Grand Magistrix Elisande, with the intention of going casual.

World of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 2
The second Chronicle book was previewed on IGN, giving us a few teasers about what we should anticipate from the graphic novel. This book series was written to tell the story of Warcraft and everything it entails. Volume 1 covered everything from creation until the rise of humanity, while Volume 2 tells us the story of Ancient Draenor. Currently the Chronicle series is set to release Volume 3 on March 27, 2018.
