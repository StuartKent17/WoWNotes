Legion - Azshara<br>
We found some interesting references to Azshara. Unfortunately there isn&apos;t much more than what is below yet. Keep in mind that this is just a reference in an alpha build of Legion, not something final or officially announced. Spoilers below!<br>
<br>
Azsuna - &quot;Ten Thousand Years Ago&quot; - The Council at Val&apos;Sharah<br>
Senegos: Ten thousand years ago, I found myself mixed up with a rebel alliance of sorts.<br>
Senegos: This was during the pinnacle of Queen Azshara&apos;s power over the elves. Her abuse of magic had grown dangerously strong.<br>
Senegos: We plotted to use the Tidestone of Golganneth against the queen.<br>
<br>
Senegos: Cenarius. I can wield the Tidestone, but I must warn you: we risk destroying the entire Well of Eternity!<br>
Cenarius: That, my friend, is precisely the plan.<br>
Illidan: Fah! We need simply to do away with Queen Azshara herself, not the very source of our people&apos;s power.<br>
Farondis: I agree. We are firing a cannon at sparrows.<br>
Tyrande: We are fighting the greatest danger our world has ever seen!<br>
Tyrande: Even now, Queen Azshara colludes with demons. She puts our world at risk.<br>
Cenarius: Very well. Prince Farondis, you can secure the Tidestone of Golganneth?<br>
Farondis: I shall have it arranged, Cenarius.<br>
<br>
Azsuna - &quot;The Fate of Nar&apos;thalas&quot; - Memory Scene<br>
Attendant: Here it is, my Prince: The Tidestone of Golganneth, one of the seven Stones of Creation, and treasured relic of the kaldorei.<br>
Farondis: Very good. Leave me.<br>
* Attendant leaves.<br>
Farondis: I&apos;m sorry, Cenarius. I believed in your cause, but I couldn&apos;t bring myself to turn against...<br>
* Azshara enters.<br>
* Farondis kneels before Azshara.<br>
Farondis: My queen.<br>
Azshara: You&apos;ve done me a great service today, Farondis.<br>
Azshara: What a shame that you won&apos;t LIVE to reap the benefits of my gratitude.<br>
Farondis: ...what?!<br>
Azshara: This whole valley is filled with plotters and schemers.<br>
Azshara: Cavorting with Cenarius behind my back? I will NOT tolerate dissent!<br>
Azshara: You must all be taught a lesson.<br>
* Azshara uses lightning to blow up the Tidestone.<br>

Legion - Artifact Weapon Previews<br>
Today we have the Restoration Shaman Artifact Scepter of Azshara (beta.wowdb.com/items/128911-scepter-of-azshara). Some of the shields are missing or incorrect, so don&apos;t worry if they look somewhat off or are missing. <br>

My main has been hunter for years. With all the spell removals why does Feed Pet still exist? Pet loyalty is gone.<br>
In this case, it has no impact on keybindings, and minimal potential confusion, so is kept purely for flavor. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/684526595051106304))<br>

Remove Curse for Mages _increases_ class fantasy, yet it&apos;s being removed, whats the reasoning there?<br>
Removing Curses is not really part of the iconic Warcraft Mage fantasy, and didn&#x2019;t fit the desired gameplay. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/684529183427461120))<br>

Any plans to be able to glyph out the pistol for throwing axes/knives or similar, for the others?<br>
Not currently, though it&#x2019;s something we&apos;ll consider! Primary focus is on creating a strong core fantasy for Outlaws. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/684525445958651905))<br>
<br>
with so much CC stripped away are we going to just be tunneling damage into each other? HOW BORING<br>
CC overall is being reduced. Blind was removed as Subtlety&apos;s rotation now includes Cheap Shot. Extremely strong. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/684524931107827712))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
of the 3 possibilities you mentioned (https://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler/answers/135754035339)-incompetent, overworked, lazy- how often is at least 1 of them a factor? i imagine 10%<br>
It&apos;s usually not lazy. At the places I have worked, devs are horrified at the thought of disappointing players. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/684211512253087744))<br>
So in the strictest sense, most of the mistakes we make are those of competence - we make a call that ends up being bad. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/684211686669029377))<br>
But I originally meant competency in the sense that it&apos;s easy to throw colleagues under the bus if you aren&apos;t careful. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/684211905808891904))<br>
Saying &quot;Our engineers couldn&apos;t find the bug&quot; out of context invites detractors to say &quot;Well, get better engineers.&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/684212132422926336))<br>
<br>
yeah, I&apos;m pretty sure the Pony metaphor was about over-sharing and over-promising.<br>
Early in my career, I communicated everything but ended up sending the message that I was in over my head. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/684213201823645696))<br>
<br>
Yeah, some players have a habit of arguing broken promises as a way to force your hand. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/684212978548264960))<br>
Some people also REALLY have a hard time confusing with changing one&apos;s mind and when one is lying. <br>
Yeah, players should REALLY not want devs to go through with bad ideas just because they were promised. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/684214179889205248))</div></div>
