MMO-Champion Update - Boss Pages and New Menu!
We're getting closer to the Patch 3.1 release on live servers and I finally had the time to push live a nice menu for all the patch 3.1 content and a nicer version of all the ulduar bosses pages! There is still a few bugs with it but they should be fixed as soon as possible. 

You can expect a few more categories and pages very soon, today's update is merely to make sure that I stop postponing it.
