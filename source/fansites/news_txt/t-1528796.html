Warlords of Draenor - Tier 17 Shaman Armor Set<br>
Today we are taking a look at the Tier 17 Shaman armor set. No Mythic set has been added for Shamans yet. <br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor changes things up slightly by using one set of art for Raid Finder, one set of art for Normal and Heroic, and one set of art for Mythic difficulty. You can find the Raid Finder armor sets in our Raid Finder armor sets preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3940-Warlords-of-Draenor-Raid-Finder-Armor-Sets-Draenei-Guard-Armor-Set-Blue-Tweets-Art). <br>

The Iron Maidens<br>
With little opportunity to exercise her tactical brilliance under the ancient social structure of the orc clans, Gar&apos;an was thrilled to be one of the first warriors to volunteer for naval duty under the Iron Horde. Instantly successful in battle, she was named Admiral of the Iron Horde fleet and selected Marak and Sorka as her lieutenants. Together, they are called The Iron Maidens - and have crushed any who have dared face them in battle.<br>
<br>
<br>
Overview - The Iron Maidens periodically gain Iron Fury. As the Maidens gain Iron Fury, they gain new abilities. Periodically, one of the Maidens will use a zipline to man the Dreadnaught&apos;s main cannon, from which she will bombard players. A team of players must use loading chains to get to the deck of the boat, defeat the Deckhand stationed there, and sabotage the ammunition of the main cannon before it finishes Warming Up. Whenever one of the Maidens reaches 20% health, they will all activate Iron Will. Players must then quickly defeat them before being overwhelmed.<br>
<br>
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/dps.png&quot; title=&quot;Dps&quot; /&gt; Damage Dealers - Blade Dash can be deadly - avoid standing close to other players if you are battling Sorka.<br>

&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/tank.png&quot; title=&quot;Tank&quot; /&gt; Tanks - Move between Marak and the target of her Blood Ritual to intercept the effect of Crystalized Blood.<br>
Minimize damage taken by Marak&apos;s melee strikes while Sanguine Strikes is active.<br>

Azzakel, Vanguard of the Legion<br>
On Argus - the former homeworld of the Draenei, now the stronghold of the Burning Legion - Azzakel waits, poised for a servant of the Legion to open a portal to one of the countless worlds they seek to invade. As Soulbinder Nyami lowers the defenses of Auchindoun, Azzakel senses that his services will soon be employed towards the destruction of the holiest of Draenei temples.<br>
<br>
<br>
Overview - Azzakel alternates between engaging players directly in combat and summoning reinforcements from the demon world Argus. While summoning reinforcements, Azzakel cannot be attacked and players should focus on quickly defeating the reinforcements that emerge from the portal, so that they are not overwhelmed as more demons invade.<br>

Witherbark<br>
<br>
Overview - As Witherbark attacks he consumes his stores of Aqueous Energy. At 0 Aqueous Energy, Witherbark gains Brittle Bark and Aqueous Globules form at the edge of the lake and move towards him. Each globule that reaches Witherbark restores 25 Aqueous Energy. If a globule crosses paths with an Unchecked Growth, it animates and attacks. At 100 Energy, Aqueous Globules no longer form and Witherbark loses Brittle Bark, freeing him to attack.<br>
<br>
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/dps.png&quot; title=&quot;Dps&quot; /&gt; Damage Dealers - Avoid Unchecked Growth.<br>

Any chance you can tell me the character base move speed in ft/sec and the base shot speed in ft/sec?<br>
Base player move speed is 7yd/sec.Aimed Shot travels at 40yd/sec.What&apos;s your concern? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470667302539894784))<br>

how many times are we going to be refreshing sunfire in solar? aiming for max power or duration?<br>
For boss DPS, probably two Sunfires per Solar; that gives you 100% Sunfire uptime. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470384395535126528))<br>
<br>
Why not make Wrath/Starfire share a button similar to moonfire/sunfire now that stopping the eclipse bar isn&apos;t a thing?<br>
Confusing to have a button swap mid-cast. Just makes the rotation easier. There&apos;s skill to picking the best one, timing-wise. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470381795704193024))<br>
Can the Starsurge buff be split between Wrath/Starfire? Does it set which buff based on bar position or first cast?<br>
You get one of the two Empowerment buffs based on where your bar is when you cast Starsurge. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470387398421925888))<br>
<br>
with astral storm being removed, is hurricanes&apos; spell damage type being changed in any way?<br>
No, still Nature. Though planning a glyph to swap Hurricane to Astral Storm and Starfall to Sunfall. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470477063359430656))<br>
they&apos;ll switch between eclipses with that glyph or no?<br>
No, just always. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470479158280069120))<br>
ok, with the change to starsurge, is it just a instant cast buff that doesn&apos;t do the spellstorm damage anymore?<br>
No, it still does the spellstorm damage, and has a 1.5sec cast time. It&apos;s still Starsurge. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470480339173785600))<br>
So Starsurge being instant is ruled out?<br>
No, not ruled out. Just trying with a 1.5sec cast time first. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470665334991912960))<br>
<br>
Could you please briefly describe how Crit/Haste/Readiness will affect the new Balance talents i.e will haste affect cycle time?<br>
None of those affect the cycle time. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470667012759617537))<br>
<br>
Noticed on some notes that Ravage is being removed. Will feral dps get some new Sunday punch or what excatly?<br>
Ravage was merged with Shred. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470468741788999680))<br>
<br>
Quick Q regarding Ursa Major - can both MS from a single event proc it?<br>
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470480177676316672))<br>
How does it work?Always 2% ? Or stackable % ?<br>
Its benefit rolls. Whatever % is left (based on time) from the previous buff is added to the next one. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470510054827773952))<br>
Example: You&apos;ve got a 24% buff up, with 25sec left, and refresh it. 24%*25sec/30sec = 20%. Plus new 2%, result = +22%. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470511259960352768))<br>

Where within Black Arrow does the guaranteed lock and load take place?<br>
Somewhere; no guaranteed spot, just somewhere. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470480143538860032))<br>
One assumption is that if it hasn&apos;t triggered by the last tick, it must on the last tick.<br>
Yes, that&apos;d be fair, through process of elimination. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470664574514237440))<br>
(Oh, that&apos;s not how it works, though. It&apos;s not like the last tick ends up having a higher proc frequency.) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470664764742721536))<br>
Any info on how it does work?<br>
It determines at cast time how many procs there&apos;ll be, then randomly distributes those procs throughout the ticks. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470668856877666304))<br>
Proc count starts at 1, then it has successive 20% chances to add 1, until it fails a roll. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470669260583624705))<br>
That&apos;s kind of neat.Proc count=2, 10 ticks, rng generator rolls 2 times, predetermining ticks 3 and 7 to proc...?<br>
Yep. But you don&apos;t need to know any of that in order to play optimally; that&apos;s just the nitty gritty. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470698171635871744))<br>
Prob. Pushing my luck, but IF black arrow works with readiness, would that lead to oddities with &lt;20 second cd?<br>
Perhaps. It&apos;s something we know we&apos;ll need to solve if we do put Black Arrow on Readiness. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470702054311481344))<br>

Avert Harm is taken away, Black Ox: Guard, and the Dizzying Haze &quot;misfire&quot; as well. So where is brewmaster utility? TBR?<br>
Misfire was basically non-existent; didn&apos;t work on bosses. Brewmasters are extremely mobile, good at controlling damage, (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470672941974552577))<br>
and good at picking up new adds. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470673061998780417))<br>
<br>
Regarding the #WoD changes to Black Ox Statue&apos;s &quot;Guard&quot;, what do Brewmasters now have to provide any type of wall for our raid? <br>
If you&apos;re talking an Absorb effect, nothing. They do still have healing. Chi Burst, Chi Torpedo (undertuned on live, I know). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470666428648263681))<br>
Thank you for responding. But I mean, aside from &quot;kite tanking&quot;, what mashes Brewmaster diserable vs any other tank now?<br>
They&apos;re still very good tanks. Ox Guard was minor. Other tanks lost things similarly. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470672403719528448))<br>
I don&apos;t argue that, all of the tanks are good tanks, Blizz has done a great job. But, I now bring no raid utility, just AOE slow<br>
We&apos;re bringing down the raid utility of *all* tanks, not just Brewmasters. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470673790570332160))<br>
that&apos;s fair. I just felt that AoE damage reduction CDs, felt really nice in the hands of the tank role. Being the raid&apos;s shield.<br>
Feeling-wise, I totally understand and agree. Gameplay-wise, we need to reduce the number of such CDs, and tanks are one... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470677151105429504))<br>

So prot pallies will no longer have a passive self heal? Or is that being rolled into something else?<br>

Does Devouring Plague&apos;s DoT still scale with Shadow Orbs used in WoD? Tooltip change is kind of unclear.<br>
In effect, yes, since the DoT is now a % of the direct damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470667588482383872))<br>
Just to double check: The &quot;additional 100% damage over 6 sec&quot; means 100% of the direct damage dealt, not 100% of SP over 6 sec?<br>
Correct. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470671843519897600))<br>

Resolve is complication w/o depth. % based heals feel much better, ie Enraged Regen. Choices will not change with diff Resolve<br>
That&apos;s actually the point; we don&apos;t want it to. We want Shield Barrior and Shield Block to *both* be useful, whether... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470431181733785600))<br>

Hiya, isn&apos;t weaving execute into normal war rotation a bit expensive in terms of cost? Can wars pool that much rage in seconds?<br>
Sometimes, yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470665832356655104))<br>

Character / Items<br>
is T16 Gear going to be better than Heroic Dungeon gear next expansion? be pretty stupid if this is true.<br>
What makes you think that would be the case? Max-level dungeon gear has always replaced the last expansion&apos;s gear. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/469666461770723328))<br>

Heirlooms. Will they swap between str/agi &amp; int? Time to remove the 80/85 dif? What happens if you have 2x of a kind?<br>
No plans to offer switching stats.Other stuff is too complicated for 140 characters. (Source (https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/470792917251264513))<br>

Please make the Hordebreaker title account-wide.<br>
Seems like an oversight that it&apos;s not. I&apos;ll fix that for 6.0. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/469868522102083584))<br>

Free Faction Change<br>
Is this something considered for non-PvP realms too?<br>
PvE realms tend to have a far better ratio. We will see though. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469728049756246016))<br>

FinalBoss - Blizzcon 2013 Live Raid<br>
In the Blue Tweets above, Watcher mentioned that the Blizzcon Live Raid is one of the most popular events at Blizzcon when someone asked about having one this year. If you didn&apos;t watch it last year, FinalBoss has released (http://finalboss.tv/main/2014/5/30/episode-44-blizzcon-2013-live-raid) a nice cut down version of the live raid that is faster to watch. <br>
