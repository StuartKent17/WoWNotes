Out of the wall of text, there are two very interesting comments.<br>
<br>
<br>
Question<br>
And does that include toning down Stormherald swinging, Mortal Strike Warriors, who are dominating GROUP PvP? That&apos;s where balance is supposed to be met, right? <br>
<br>
Answer<br>
Yes, one of the changes is a reduction to the mace spec stun proc rate. It should still be as good as the other specs, just not clearly the favorite. <br>
<br>
Question<br>
Is it acceptable to you, the game developers, where Warlocks are?<br>
<br>
Answer<br>
Nope. Although I could probably say that to varying degree about any class depending on what particular part of the game you&apos;re talking about. Patch 2.2 has the resilience change for starters, and patch 2.3 has more changes, including improvements to a lot of the things that were discussed at blizzcon.<br>

<br>
This also means that the 2.3 will probably be a huge patch like what the 2.1 was, with tons of improvements for each class. (as well with Guild banks and Zul&apos;aman) <br>

RSS feed bugs<br>
Lately I&apos;ve been getting a bunch of mails saying that the RSS feed isn&apos;t updating properly. To be honest I really don&apos;t know why people are experiencing some bugs, but the most likely reason is a wrong RSS feed URL. The RSS feed for latest news from the homepage is this one (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?type=rss;action=.xml;board=2.0;sa=news;)<br>
<br>
If you add a RSS feed from the site while you&apos;re not on the homepage (like on the news forums), you&apos;ll get the feed from this forum, but not the real news feed. Let me know if you&apos;re still experiencing problems after you doubletriple-checked the URL. <br>
