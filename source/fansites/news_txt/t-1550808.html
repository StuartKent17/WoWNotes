Welcome once again to Artcraft! I&#x2019;m Chris Robinson, art director of World of Warcraft. This Artcraft is another quick one, but still packed with goodies. Today we&#x2019;re showing you our work on the male Draenei. The original was one of the better character models in the game, so it didn&#x2019;t require a ton of translation&#x2014;but with higher-resolution textures and more polygons to work with, we were able to bump up his fidelity quite a bit, as well as improve how we convey emotion through a new animation rig.<br>
<br>
That&#x2019;s all for now&#x2014;thanks again for continuing to follow along as we develop these updated character models. See you next time!<br>
<br>
