Boubouille2011-09-07, 03:52 AMHeroic: Ragnaros Nerf
The Heroic version of Ragnaros in the Firelands has been hotfixed and considerably nerfed a few minutes ago http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/971966. 


The 25-man version of Ragnaros now has 246M HP, down from 290M.
The 10-man version of Ragnaros now has 74M HP.


There are also various reports of the fight feeling easier overall, and a couple of other fights in the Firelands raid seems to have been changed as well. Hopefully this wasn't a stealth nerf and we'll hear from Blizzard soon.
