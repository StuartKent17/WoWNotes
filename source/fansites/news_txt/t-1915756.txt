Legion - Invasion Event
There are some pieces of the pre-expansion invasion event currently in the Alpha, but they are very much incomplete. 


The Legion will invade several different zones of Azeroth. Right now they can be found in Tanaris, Hillsbrad, and the Wetlands.
Right now there are small invasions, larger invasions, and named NPCs marked on the map when you are in each of those zones. 
There are a few quests that seem to be related, piloting a vehicle to kill Legion invaders, as well as timed kills. 
Several of the invasion sites have a chest you can open. Currently the chest only contains a placeholder, Timeless Isle items.
There are also buffs you can pick up at some of the invasion sites, such as Felrune Barrier 
There are several scenarios that may be related to the event invasion point.

Class Halls
Why should we camp _pandarian_ starting zone insead of gorgeous M.of Shado-Pan/White Tiger or Peak of Serenity? How on Earth can someone's _racial_ zone be a part of "class fantazy"? Comparing to other CHs we got a joke
It seems to be worse than garrisons, and being forced o start everyday there sounds terrible and boring like hell.
Dalaran maintains portals to and from the class halls to keep you in the action! DaveKosak 

The worse - you are making a strong racial point here, by appointing W.I. as our CH. It's saying monks = pandas.
I'm sorry you don't like WI, lots of us were excited to feature beautiful place that all races of monks can now enjoy. DaveKosak 

Lore
Is"Tirisgarde" mentioned in the mage artifact quests a synonym of the Order of Tirisfal/Tirisfalen?
New group, dedicated to fighting Legion here and now! DaveKosak
