<br>
Maw of Souls<br>
On Mythic Keystone difficulty, the portal to Stormheim should no longer be covered up by the Challenger&apos;s Cache.<br>
<br>
Return to Karazhan<br>
Players who may have missed the final turn-in to Khadgar inside of the Return to Karazhan dungeon are now able to turn in &#x201C;Fragments of the Past&#x201D; and &#x201C;In the Eye of the Beholder&#x201D; to Khadgar outside of Karazhan.<br>
&quot;In the Eye of the Beholder&quot; and &quot;The Tower of Power&quot; should no longer fail to give players credit when defeating the final boss.<br>

Lingering Soul Fragments for the quest &quot;Soul Prism of the Illidari&quot; should now be guaranteed to drop from Heroic dungeon end bosses.<br>

<br>
Karazhan Quests Hotfix<br>
Yesterday, a hotfix to the game corrected an issue where players weren&#x2019;t receiving credit for killing Viz&#x2019;aduum on the quests In the Eye of the Beholder and Tower of Power. This introduced a new issue where the quest &#x201C;Tower of Power&#x201D; now appears to be incomplete, even after you kill Viz&#x2019;aduum. Try turning in the quest in your Class Hall after killing Viz&#x2019;aduum for the week, even if it doesn&#x2019;t look complete.<br>
<br>
We apologize for the confusion.</div></div>
