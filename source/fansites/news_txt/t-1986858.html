Legendary Item Effects in PvP<br>
Your understanding is correct. They will be disabled in all PvP instances, including unrated battlegrounds. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/409422-will-legendary-effects-be-disabled-in-unrated-bgs/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743394515?page=1#2))<br>

World Quest Icons<br>
Skull Rare Elite WQs are Dungeon World Quests, requiring a dungeon group.<br>
<br>
Sounds like this iconography isn&apos;t particularly self-explanatory though, will pass that along to the UI guys. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/409314-simple-question-for-devs-about-world-quests/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743314522?page=1#7))<br>
<br>
Order Hall Resources and Upgrades<br>
So the point is that you you guys thought this would be the end all be all resource dump since there really aren&apos;t any compelling rewards? Honestly I wish the team would&apos;ve just decided to unlock the upgrades through quests rather than currency. Or am I missing some information?<br>
The primary source of Order Hall Resources is doing quests. We&apos;ll be laying out the details of Legion&apos;s endgame structure as we get closer to release - it feels premature to publish a blog on the subject while we&apos;re still iterating on exactly how all the pieces fit together, as well as tuning. But Legion has at least as much max-level outdoor content as Mists of Pandaria did, except with a different structure (world quests complemented by one-time story moments) that lets us offer more player choice and day-to-day variation, to avoid some of the pitfalls of Mists, where we heard player feedback about repetition and burnout.<br>
<br>
As for the subject of the thread, yeah, as Muffinus noted above, this is one of many different perks that you can unlock (or not), and is intended to offer a small time-saving convenience. If anything, it may end up being undesirable because of its limitations, and we wouldn&apos;t be willing to buff it to the point where it&apos;d be truly &quot;strong&quot; because that would cut directly against the value, expressed many times here in this discussion, of actually going out and adventuring. We&apos;ll see how it plays out in further testing.

Holy Paladin Feedback -- Build 21531 -- 21-Apr<br>
Tuning is still early and right now is drifting around a lot, as unrelated changes happen without necessarily being compensated for in terms of tuning. Looks like H Pal DPS is somewhat lower than other healers in this build (possibly largely due to the loss of Holy Bolt); we&apos;ll bring it up next build so it&apos;s in the ballpark before more detailed tuning happens.

The Broken Shore<br>
soz just salty about how the alliance keeps getting boned it looks like<br>
you should wait for the Horde&apos;s side to pass judgement (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720427372336447488))<br>
<br>
seriously, da fuq? Why cant it be the Alliance that fuqs up? Its always the horde.<br>
Things are not always as one side sees them. The Horde may have a different perspective on how things went down at the end. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720419643278516225))<br>
<br>
Racials<br>
Arcane Torrent being on the GCD is a bug, and will be fixed in the next Alpha update. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/720686270049943552))<br>
<br>
Classes<br>
During the Demon Hunter early access, will we be able to explore Azeroth and maybe level profs before the expansion hits?<br>
During the pre-launch, you will be able to take your demon hunter wherever you please. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720681929012486144))<br>
<br>
Realm Hopping<br>
Any plans to stop people from &apos;realm-hopping&apos; into raids trying to form then leaving at once?<br>
We realize it&#x2019;s a major nuisance and we&#x2019;re investigating solutions. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/720761664853782528))<br>
<br>
BMAH<br>
Why is the Black market in Dalaran? the whole point of BMAH is its supposed to be in a dangerous unsafe area? now zero threat.<br>
Oh, but the Dalaran Underbelly is a hive of scum and villainy. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/720760181122928640))<br>
<br>
Artifact Weapons<br>
Is it intentional that Artifact Relics cannot be removed from the Artifact once they&apos;ve been placed?<br>
Yes. Relics will be replaced primarily on the basis of item level; they&#x2019;re not meant to be Glyphs 2.0. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/720763957858861056))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
I love world pvp, I hate FFA arenas though. Why most of them? This game wasn&apos;t designed around 1v1.<br>
FFA is about as far from 1v1 as you can get (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720425492763922432))<br>
Then in that case it&apos;s just PvP guilds hoarding them, or waiting till 3 AM just to have a shot.<br>
Some options to consider: no grouping (full FFA), limited groups (max 5 man), buffing solo-ers. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720469173047058432))<br>
Most times I see groups of friends at FFA making it so that only their friend wins. Which isn&apos;t fun<br>
We&apos;re gonna make world PvP work here, please keep up the feedback! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720476399610568704))<br>
