Boubouille2009-08-18, 10:25 AMUpdate - Apparently, the schedule published this morning was outdated and Blizzard posted a new one, see below. 

Blizzcon 2009 Schedule now Available
The schedule  for the Blizzcon is now available. You can always read World of Warcraft - Cataclysm  and sharpen your pitchforks while you wait, 3 more days to go! 


 


 

This year, for the first time, you'll have the opportunity to enjoy a live Internet stream of BlizzCon coverage from the comfort of your own home. The stream includes the same content as the DIRECTV pay-per-view event, but you do not have to be a DIRECTV subscriber to purchase it. It consists of over 16 hours of video, including interviews and commentary, main stage presentations, and tournament coverage. Itâ€™s now available to order for $39.95, and purchasers will also receive the BlizzCon 2009-exclusive in-game pet, Grunty the Murloc Marine not available in all regions. Head over to the BlizzCon 2009 Live Stream website to get more information, to test video playback on your system, or to place an order.
