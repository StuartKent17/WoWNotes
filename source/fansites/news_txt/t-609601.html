21:30 CEST - The Talent Calculator (http://www.mmo-champion.com/talent/) has been updated, you can now shift + left click to remove talent points. <br>
19:30 CEST - The Talent Calculator (http://www.mmo-champion.com/talent/) has been updated to fix some bugs.<br>
16:30 CEST - The Death Knight Skills (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=650) have been updated with rune cost for all the spells. <br>
<br>
---------<br>
<br>
Update (Talent Calculator) : For people who REALLY want to play with talents, our internal Talent Calculator (http://www.mmo-champion.com/talent/) is now available. Keep in mind that it&apos;s not really supposed to be public and there are probably a bunch of bugs here, but it should be working for most of you. (Note to IE6 users : Get Firefox) <br>
<br>
It seems that some of the fansites part of the official fansite program were allowed (http://www.worldofraids.com/forums/showthread.php?t=17115) to posts all the info from the skills and talents of the Death Knight gathered during the Worldwide Invitational. I guess that&apos;s the time to officially start the WotLK preview here and we&apos;ll start with the skills and talents of all the classes except for the Hunter and Paladins (not available yet) <br>
<br>
More to come depending on ... how it goes. (We all know what it means)<br>
<br>
Disclaimer<br>
This is ALPHA stuff, it can and most likely will be changed and a lot of things will be modified before Wrath of the Lich King is released. This is only a preview of the final game but doesn&apos;t reflect the balance between classes at the release. Also note that any post with screenshots of the alpha will be moderated, the old &quot;no WotLK stuff&quot; rule still applies. <br>
