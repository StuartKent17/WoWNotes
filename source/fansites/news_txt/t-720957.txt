4 Screenshots have been added to the Screenshot of the Day Gallery http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/downloads/ssotd/#latest on the official site. They're different point of views of zones we already saw and hopefully it means that Blizzard is done with it and that the NDA will be lifted soon. Or maybe I'll just start posting naked gnomes on the front page to keep you interested.

Remote Auction House Beta Test in Europe
My plan to send horde of puppies to Blizzard's EU HQ worked and the remote Auction House beta test finally started in Europe. 
The World of Warcraft Remote Auction House beta test is now open for business! The Remote Auction House is a new service in development that lets players access the World of Warcraft Auction House from the Armory website http://eu.wowarmory.com/auctionhouse/ or the Mobile Armory app for iPhone and iPod touch http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=321057000&mt=8. Players can browse their characters’ local Auction Houses with the same search functionality available in the game, as well as see the real-time status of each of their current bids and auctions.

As we’d mentioned previously certain features of the Remote Auction House will be premium-based. Once the beta test is complete and the Remote Auction House is live, players will be able to subscribe to a new service called World of Warcraft Remote http://eu.wowarmory.com/wow-remote.xml, which will allow them to buy items; post items for sale from a character’s bags, bank, or mailbox; collect gold from their bids and auctions; and more. During the beta test, players can try out these features for free, and each World of Warcraft account will be able to perform up to 25 transactions per day. Please note this limit will be increased at launch.

For more information on the Remote Auction House, refer to the FAQ http://eu.wowarmory.com/faq-auction-house.xml. We hope you enjoy trying out this new service, and we look forward to hearing your feedback in the thread below.
