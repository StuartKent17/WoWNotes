Boubouille2007-06-28, 10:31 AMLately I've been getting a lot of mails about a new video tons of things leaked from the new expansion featuring Northrend. I already spent some time answering some mails, but a news might be a good way to prevent more of them. Here is the video.




And here is the timeline, explaining why it's a big, huge, fake.

00:00 : The human you see is only wearing the tier 4 warrior set and is using two glaves models that have been in game for a lot of time. Same character  in WoWModelViewer
00:29 : Badly photoshopped logo, it's just the classic logo recolored and with a few ice effects. 
00:35 : Wow ... Loading screen ! Hey wait, I think I already saw this one. Undead Campaign Screen  in Warcraft 3.
00:57 : Orc Warlock in a Tier 6 armor set, nothing new here. 
01:02 : A normal character selection screen with a new class ... This is just the Wisp Race icon  used for the Blizzard's april fool joke in 2006.
01:30 : Emerald Dream ... Nothing new, for example if you check this movie  you'll see the same thing, and it's one year old. It will probably be related to Northrend but it's not leaked from the expansion, just from current game files. 
02:34 : Northrend on world map, look like a stretched version of this fan map 
02:40 : Northrend map, same as this fan map 
02:45 : Cinematic ... From Warcraft 3, the Frozen throne, this is the first part of the ending cinematic. Screenshot from the original 
03:18 : Map, I think it's from Warcraft 3 : FT too, but I'm not sure about this one.
03:22 : End of the cinematic used earlier. Screenshot from the original
