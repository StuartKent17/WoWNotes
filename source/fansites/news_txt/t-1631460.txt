chaud2014-11-13, 02:37 AMWarlords of Draenor Launch Timer
Warlords of Draenor is live in the US and EU! A hotfix for quest objective bottlenecks is in the works https://twitter.com/Rygarius/status/532723636164395008.


Warlords Launch - Additional Khadgars
Khadgar has cast Mirror Image and some of you have probably already noticed a few additional versions of his NPC around Azeroth. He's there to help you get to Draenor once the expansion goes live!

We've had some time to evaluate the overwhelmingly positive response to Warlords of Draenor as it went live for European players, and realized getting you through the Dark Portal in an efficient manner is important. When the switch from Mists of Pandaria to Warlords takes place at 12:00 a.m. PST, you will automatically receive a quest titled "The Dark Portal" that will direct you to visit Khadgar in the Blasted Lands. However, now that we have four more Khadgars added to the world, you can go to one them as well!

Here are Khadgar's locations:


Stormwind - next to the Hero's Call Board in the Trade District Orgrimmar - next to the Warchief's Command Board in the Valley of Strength Shrine of Seven Stars Alliance - in front of the main entrance Shrine of Two Moons Horde - in front of the main entrance


Note: if you happen to not receive the initial quest that leads you to Draenor, have no fear! Just find your closest Khadgar and he'll lead the way.

Stables http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/67-stables Icy Veins Guide http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/garrison-stables-guide - Stay mounted while interacting with objects, don't get dazed, and 20% more movement speed at Level 3. You won't get to Level 3 while leveling.

Warlords Launch Mini-FAQ
I've seen a handful of questions with regards to what happens when Warlords of Draenor launches, so here's a brief FAQ that should hopefully clear up questions.

When will the launch of the game happen for my time zone/region?
Warlords of Draenor will launch in:


Europe at 12:00 a.m. CET on Thursday, November 13 North America US at 12:00 a.m. PST 1:00 a.m. Mountain, 2:00 a.m. CST, 3:00 a.m. EST on Thursday, November 13 Oceanic will launch at the same time as the US. 
Korea at 12:00 a.m. KST on Tuesday, November 18 Taiwan at 12:00 a.m. CST on Tuesday, November 18 China at 12:00 a.m. CST on Tuesday, November 18


How do I get to Draenor?
When the clock hits midnight or whatever respective time zone you're in, you'll see the following things happen:

A server message yellow text in your chat window will be displayed, signaling the launch of Warlords of Draenor! If you've already upgraded your account to Warlords of Draenor, a quest will popup in your quest log, directing you to the Blasted Lands. You do not need to be in a major city to receive this quest. If you haven't upgraded your account, you won't be able to receive the quest or venture in Draenor until you do. Once you get to Blasted Lands, speak to Khadgar outside the Dark Portal to head to Draenor! Note: you don't need to be online at midnight to get the quest, it'll be waiting for you whenever you do decide to login. 


Do I need to install Warlords of Draenor or use the install disc?
If you're already playing on retail realms, you have all the files you need to play Warlords of Draenor - no further downloads or installs are required. If you haven't updated your WoW client to version 6.0.3 yet, you can either just run the Battle.net app to do so, or install the game using the Game Disc DVD if you bought a Box Copy of Warlords of Draenor.

Do i need to logout at midnight before I start leveling?
Nope! If you've already upgraded your account to Warlords of Draenor, you won't need to do anything! You can always double check your account status by logging into the Account Management page at https://us.battle.net/account/management/

What happens if I boost a character to level 90 after Warlords of Draenor launches?
If you haven't upgraded your account to Warlords of Draenor yet, your boosted character will be placed in Blasted Lands. If you've upgraded your account to Warlords of Draenor, boosted characters are placed directly in Tanaan Jungle. 


Will I be able to invite a friend to my realm and quest together, vise versa? didn't see anything pertaining to this answered, would be nice to know.
Yup! You'll be grouped together on the same realm.

What happens if someone boosted a character, he's in Blasted Lands with the Iron Invasion quest chain but he can't login to play again till after WOD goes live?
The quest chain actually doesn't disappear when WoD launches. The Feat of Strength and associated title is no longer awarded, but you can still do the quests, gaining the quest rewards gear and the pet, Iron Starlette. So your friend would be able to continue the quest chain in Blasted Lands and unlock the rest of his abilities.
