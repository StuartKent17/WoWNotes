chaud2014-11-13, 02:37 AMWarlords of Draenor Launch Timer
Warlords of Draenor is live in the US and EU! A hotfix for quest objective bottlenecks is in the works 


Warlords Launch - Additional Khadgars
Khadgar has cast Mirror Image and some of you have probably already noticed a few additional versions of his NPC around Azeroth. He's there to help you get to Draenor once the expansion goes live!

We've had some time to evaluate the overwhelmingly positive response to Warlords of Draenor as it went live for European players, and realized getting you through the Dark Portal in an efficient manner is important. When the switch from Mists of Pandaria to Warlords takes place at 12:00 a.m. PST, you will automatically receive a quest titled "The Dark Portal" that will direct you to visit Khadgar in the Blasted Lands. However, now that we have four more Khadgars added to the world, you can go to one them as well!

Here are Khadgar's locations:


Stormwind - next to the Hero's Call Board in the Trade District Orgrimmar - next to the Warchief's Command Board in the Valley of Strength Shrine of Seven Stars Alliance - in front of the main entrance Shrine of Two Moons Horde - in front of the main entrance


Note: if you happen to not receive the initial quest that leads you to Draenor, have no fear! Just find your closest Khadgar and he'll lead the way.


Patch 6.0.2 Recap
If you are just coming back, be sure to take a look at the Patch 6.0.2 recap for all of the system changes made to the game. 


  


Warlords of Draenor Class Perks
While leveling from 90 to 100 you will receive a few perks to your spells in a random order. Everyone has all of the perks at level 100.


  


Warlords of Draenor Dungeons

Warlords of Draenor Professions
In Warlords of Draenor, professions are heavily connected to the small garrison buildings, so both guides are combined.

Warlords of Draenor - Large Garrison Buildings
Garrisons have five large buildings, with two large plots in a Level 3 Garrison. The Barracks, Bunker / War Mill, and Stables are the three most useful buildings while leveling. You build Barracks by default while leveling, so you can keep it if you want.


Barracks  Icy Veins Guide  - Gives you a bodyguard in Draenor from Level 2 and faster follower leveling from Level 1. 
Dwarven Bunker / War Mill  Icy Veins Guide  - Gives you a better chance for upgraded quest rewards, faster follower gearing, and a free bonus roll every week at level 3.
Mage Tower / Spirit Lodge  Icy Veins Guide  - Gives you faster travel around Draenor. It is not as useful while leveling as it takes time to unlock the portals.
Stables  Icy Veins Guide  - Stay mounted while interacting with objects, don't get dazed, and 20% more movement speed at Level 3. You won't get to Level 3 while leveling. 
Gearworks / Workshop  Icy Veins Guide  - Gives you some inventions to play with and a siege vehicle at Level 3. This is likely the least useful building for most players.



    
    
  


Warlords of Draenor - Medium Garrison Buildings

Barn  Icy Veins Guide  - Gives you leather, meat, fur, and Savage Blood  for crafting epic armor and weapons.

Warlords of Draenor - Small Garrison Buildings
Most of the small garrison buildings are related to professions, with two exceptions. You can find all of the small buildings in the menu on the front page. Icy Veins has some guides  for the small buildings as well! 


Profession buildings - Give you an additional daily cooldown and the ability to craft the most powerful items of each profession.
Salvage Yard  - Helps you to gear up followers faster.
Storehouse  - Grants access to your bank, higher work order cap, access to your guild bank, more active work orders, and Void Storage / Transmog NPCs.



    


Warlords of Draenor - Special Garrison Buildings
The Herb Garden and Mines are two special garrison buildings that don't take a plot from other buildings. You will want to do the simple quest to unlock these as soon as possible. Icy Veins has guides  on these buildings, as well as the other special buildings like the Fishing Shack or Pet Menagerie.


    


Warlords of Draenor - Legendary Quest Line
Warlords of Draenor has an expansion long legendary quest line, similar to Mists of Pandaria. You can start at level 98 with Call of the Archmage  by speaking to Khadgar's Servant  in your garrison. He will send you to Archmage Khadgar  in Talador. 

Khadgar will send you to Skyreach  to collect an item from the last boss. This quest can be done on Normal or Heroic difficulty. After obtaining the item, you head back to Khadgar and he gives you another quest: Khadgar's Task  This quest will reward you with an epic item level 640 ring:

Warlords Launch Mini-FAQ
I've seen a handful of questions with regards to what happens when Warlords of Draenor launches, so here's a brief FAQ that should hopefully clear up questions.

When will the launch of the game happen for my time zone/region?
Warlords of Draenor will launch in:


Europe at 12:00 a.m. CET on Thursday, November 13 North America US at 12:00 a.m. PST 1:00 a.m. Mountain, 2:00 a.m. CST, 3:00 a.m. EST on Thursday, November 13 Oceanic will launch at the same time as the US. 
Korea at 12:00 a.m. KST on Tuesday, November 18 Taiwan at 12:00 a.m. CST on Tuesday, November 18 China at 12:00 a.m. CST on Tuesday, November 18


How do I get to Draenor?
When the clock hits midnight or whatever respective time zone you're in, you'll see the following things happen:

A server message yellow text in your chat window will be displayed, signaling the launch of Warlords of Draenor! If you've already upgraded your account to Warlords of Draenor, a quest will popup in your quest log, directing you to the Blasted Lands. You do not need to be in a major city to receive this quest. If you haven't upgraded your account, you won't be able to receive the quest or venture in Draenor until you do. Once you get to Blasted Lands, speak to Khadgar outside the Dark Portal to head to Draenor! Note: you don't need to be online at midnight to get the quest, it'll be waiting for you whenever you do decide to login. 


Do I need to install Warlords of Draenor or use the install disc?
If you're already playing on retail realms, you have all the files you need to play Warlords of Draenor - no further downloads or installs are required. If you haven't updated your WoW client to version 6.0.3 yet, you can either just run the Battle.net app to do so, or install the game using the Game Disc DVD if you bought a Box Copy of Warlords of Draenor.

Do i need to logout at midnight before I start leveling?
Nope! If you've already upgraded your account to Warlords of Draenor, you won't need to do anything! You can always double check your account status by logging into the Account Management page at 

What happens if I boost a character to level 90 after Warlords of Draenor launches?
If you haven't upgraded your account to Warlords of Draenor yet, your boosted character will be placed in Blasted Lands. If you've upgraded your account to Warlords of Draenor, boosted characters are placed directly in Tanaan Jungle. 


Will I be able to invite a friend to my realm and quest together, vise versa? didn't see anything pertaining to this answered, would be nice to know.
Yup! You'll be grouped together on the same realm.

What happens if someone boosted a character, he's in Blasted Lands with the Iron Invasion quest chain but he can't login to play again till after WOD goes live?
The quest chain actually doesn't disappear when WoD launches. The Feat of Strength and associated title is no longer awarded, but you can still do the quests, gaining the quest rewards gear and the pet, Iron Starlette. So your friend would be able to continue the quest chain in Blasted Lands and unlock the rest of his abilities.
