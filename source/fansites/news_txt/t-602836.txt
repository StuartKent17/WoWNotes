Boubouille2007-10-25, 06:59 AMProbably last update from the day : Just to make it clear, the mad alchemist debuff is from a mail I got, I know that it's a debuff from the firefly in Zangarmarsh and that Drysc said it would be a "random elixir buff", but I also checked the game files and I can't find any new spell related to this. For the time being, we'll have to live with this theory. ^^

Update : Screenshots of the Zul'aman sets http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php#zasets have been updated. 
Update : Screenshot of the Sporeggar Exalted pet http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/sporebatdr8.jpg added.
Also it seems that one of the paladin change already listed in the updated patch notes http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php#23changes has been modified slightly, the threat reduction on Fanaticism no longer works when Righteous Fury is active.

Update : Ritual of Refreshment now requires 2 [item=17020]
The 4-piece bonus of Gladiator's set now reduces the cooldown of the Blink spell by 2 seconds instead of reducing the cast time of Polymorph by 0.15 second.

Update : Added a Season 1 Honor Price http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/s3/s1honor.jpg screenshot for weapons, might be easier to read than the chart on the 2.3 compilation post.
