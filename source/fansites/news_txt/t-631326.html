Also added a post by Ghostcrawler and the new comics I didn&apos;t have the time to post at the beginning of the week.<br>
<br>
Arenas Temporarily Disabled<br>
Oh well, this patch is getting interesting. Make sure you check the original post (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/14498162544-arenas-temporarily-disabled.html) for future updates. For the moment this is only affecting US realms. <br>
We have temporarily disabled all Arena matches while we investigate current rating calculation discrepancies. Further updates will be provided once we have additional information to share. <br>
<br>
Wintergrasp issues update<br>
We have found a solution for instability issues that were occurring in Wintergrasp. In order for this fix to go out to all realms, we will be issuing rolling restarts during off peak hours. Once the rolling restarts have concluded we will continue to monitor Wintergrasp and realm stability closely. <br>
<br>
Warlock pet health buff<br>
To get the intended result, we are going to hotfix a change to increase the health that all warlock pets gain from the warlock&apos;s stamina. Depending on your stamina and talents, you should see all of your pets go up by a few thousand health. As one example, a felhunter with 8000 health should go up to about 14,000 health. Felguards and voidwalkers will have more. Imps and succubi less. Doomguard and infernals will jump by a lot.<br>
<br>
This change should go through any minute. <br>
<br>
Patch deployment and bug fixes<br>
Yes, bugs are bugs. It is not necessarily the most efficient way to get them fixed to mention them in the role forums, though I note them when I see them. We actually have a pipeline in place in the bug forum to make sure those issues get to the proper people. I don&apos;t mind you bringing up bugs in here though, especially when they color perceptions or have huge effects on class balance.<br>
<br>
As for why we can&apos;t always fix bugs in a timely fashion, it&apos;s just the nature of software development. Sometimes it is technically difficult. Sometimes getting the bug to reproduce consistently is a challenge so we can&apos;t isolate what is causing it. Sometimes the change is so risky that it is better to live with the bug for the time being. Sometimes we need new tech to fix the bug and that time might even come at the expense of a more important feature. Several of the bugs we introduced in 3.0.8 were things that were working perfectly on our servers or in some cases even on the PTR. What happened to them in between that and live deployment? (I actually know the answer in most cases, but I&apos;m trying to illustrate what happens in developing a game as large and complex as WoW.)<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t mean to suggest that we don&apos;t test our content. We do and we have an oustanding QA department. Almost all software has bugs, especially complex applications. I am perhaps more forthcoming about the state of the game than you are used to, which may make it appear that we have more problems than we used to. But I don&apos;t honestly think that is the case. I remember how insane patch day has always been, especially a patch of this magnitude. <br>
<br>
[...]This was a massive patch in terms of number of changes. It fixed several hundred bugs of all sorts. They are not all reported in the patch notes or the patch notes would be pretty unreadable.<br>
<br>
Ulduar is a large patch from a gigabyte perspective, but that is mostly art. It will have many class changes too of course.<br>
