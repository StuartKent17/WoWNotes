Allied Race Intro Text - Highmountain Tauren<br>
Patch 7.3.5 adds some dialogue lines for the Highmountain Tauren Allied Race (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7186-Battle-for-Azeroth-Allied-Races) intro.<br>
<br>
Summoned to the Embassy<br>
Players are summoned to the embassy to choose between the Highmountain Tauren and Nightborne as the first Allied Race to pursue. <br>
Nathanos Blightcaller - The Dark Lady instructs you to meet me in Orgrimmar.<br>
Nathanos Blightcaller - Information has come to light crucial to the interests of the Horde. It is imperative we remain a step ahead of our rivals.<br>
Nathanos Blightcaller - Meet me outside Grommash Hold. Keep this quiet... or the consequences will be swift and severe.<br>
<br>
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - You have observed our operations in Silithus. Clearly the Alliance is doing everything in its power to undermine our efforts.<br>
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - The Horde&apos;s selfless leadership in the war against the Legion has left our ranks depleted. Our enemies slaver at the thought of stealing what is ours. We will not let them.<br>
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - I&apos;ve authorized the building of an embassy in Orgrimmar. From it, we will win others to our cause. Meet me there at once.<br>
<br>
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - Leaders of the Horde, I summoned you here--along with one of our greatest champions--because our enemies are gathering their strength.<br>
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - The Alliance is scouring the far corners of Azeroth in search of every advantage against us. We must do the same.<br>
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - War is coming. We need fresh blood added to the ranks of the Horde. What say you?<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - Warchief, the tauren of Highmountain fought boldly alongside us in our campaign against the Burning Legion, just as our ancestors did long ago.<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - I have invited their leaders to a great feast in Mulgore. This could be a chance to bring them to our side.<br>
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - A simple people, but strong. They would be a boon on the battlefield.<br>
Lady Liadrin -I too have a suggestion, Warchief. The sin&apos;dorei have maintained diplomatic ties with the nightborne since we helped liberate Suramar from the Legion.<br>
Lady Liadrin -The regent lord and I agree that our kingdoms have much in common. We believe the nightborne would make valuable allies.<br>
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - Even without the Nightwell, Suramar holds vast arcane resources. A most useful arrow added to my quiver.<br>
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - Each option would have its uses. I believe (player) knows both these peoples. Which potential ally do you suggest we pursue first?<br>
<br>
<br>
Highmountain Chosen<br>
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - Chieftain Bloodhoof, have our champion join you for your feast in Thunder Bluff. By the time dessert is served, I want their oath of loyalty to the Horde.<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - It shall be so, Warchief.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thunder Bluff Feast<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - Thank you for coming, Mayla. It is my honor to welcome you to Mulgore.<br>
Mayla Highmountain - Your invitation was most kind, Baine. It is time for our two peoples to renew our bonds of kinship.<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - It is of kinship that I wish to speak. I hope that--<br>
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - I should never... have left... the mountain...<br>
Mayla Highmountain - Ebonhorn! What dark force grips you?<br>
Baine Bloodhoof	- I know this power all too well. Champion! We need your help!<br>
Mayla Highmountain - I must get Ebonhorn back to Highmountain at once!<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - Until we discover what&apos;s behind this attack, Mulgore will never be safe. I will come with you, Mayla. Let us face this darkness together.<br>
<br>
<br>
Defending Thunder Bluff<br>
Uul&apos;gyneth - Destroy them! They must not hinder my return!<br>
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - Mayla... the pools...<br>
Mayla Highmountain - I understand, my friend. Baine, I must get Ebonhorn back to Highmountain.<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - Very well. We will drive this Old God filth from Thunder Bluff.<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - Your masters will not take my city, monster!<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - We will drive your shadow from Mulgore!<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - Hahahaha! It feels good to swing my mace again!<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - Thunder Bluff will be free of you!<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - Go back to the void that spawned you!<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - Go to Highmountain and aid Mayla, champion. I will join you soon.<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - I must be certain the Old Gods&apos; minions are driven from Mulgore.<br>
<br>
<br>
Saving Spiritwalker Ebonhorn<br>
Mayla Highmountain - The waters have soothed Ebonhorn, but I fear he is slipping away.<br>
Mayla Highmountain - Ebonhorn is not well. We must find a way to bring him back from the brink. Speak with Spiritwalker Graysky. I believe he can help.<br>
Mayla Highmountain - I will remain here while Graysky aids you. Pray that restoring the wards will mend Ebonhorn&apos;s mind.<br>
<br>
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - The whispers... they have stopped. Thank you, champion, Graysky.<br>
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - My mind is my own again. Return to Thunder Totem, champion. Let us gather strength for what is to come.<br>
<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - Champion! Graysky told me of your courage.<br>
<br>
<br>
Uul&apos;gyneth Backstory<br>
Mayla Highmountain - But our work is not done yet. Ebonhorn, we must know what this Darkness wants.<br>
<br>
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - Follow me, champion.<br>
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - Long ago, the Old Gods sought to lay claim to Highmountain. Their campaign was led by a terrible general... Uul&apos;gyneth the Darkness.<br>
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - Huln gathered heroes from among the tribes to stand together. They fought against Uul&apos;gyneth&apos;s servants, the Necrodark... but the forces of shadow were too great to overcome.<br>
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - So Huln devised another plan. Wards were placed to lock away the Old Gods&apos; influence. Though the general survived, Uul&apos;gyneth&apos;s essence was trapped.<br>
Mayla Highmountain - So the Necrodark have been lurking in the shadows, waiting to call forth their master.<br>
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - Indeed. And when I left the mountain to visit Mulgore, the wards weakened just enough to let the Darkness take hold.<br>
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - The last ward was placed at Highmountain Summit. That is where we must go. Just as Huln stood with his allies, so we must band together.<br>
<br>
Uul&apos;gyneth - Yes... come! Your strength will become ours, child of darkness!<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - Child of... What does he mean?<br>
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - I... cannot say. Mayla, you and I must go on ahead. Baine, you and our champion gather the others and meet us at the summit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Uul&apos;gyneth Battle<br>
Uul&apos;gyneth - This mountain belongs to us, mortals. You will soon become vessels for this world&apos;s true power!<br>
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - These heroes do not stand alone.<br>
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - Together, we will banish your darkness!<br>
Uul&apos;gyneth - You will serve us, dragon, just as Neltharion did! Your kind always bends to the whispers.<br>
Mayla Highmountain - I cannot let the Darkness possess my father&apos;s body!<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - Mayla! We must stand together!<br>
Uul&apos;gyneth - Serve your true masters, drogbar! Your defiance means death!<br>
Uul&apos;gyneth - The Skyhorn shall serve my masters! You will become the shadow that darkens the skies!<br>
Uul&apos;gyneth - The Legion was nothing compared to our power! Surrender!<br>
Uul&apos;gyneth - You have failed! The Darkness rises... and Highmountain shall fall!<br>
Uul&apos;gyneth - The wards have weakened! He will be ours!<br>
<br>
<br>
Uul&apos;gyneth Defeated<br>
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - I am free from the Old Gods&apos; grip. Thank you, my friends.<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - I did not realize that I had invited a dragon to feast with us at Thunder Bluff. Had I known, I might have set a bigger table!<br>
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - Only Mayla and our champion knew my secret before. Now I entrust it to you as well, chieftain.<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - I see no reason for anyone else to know, spiritwalker. Let it be a matter kept... between friends.<br>
Mayla Highmountain - Today was very nearly a dark day for Azeroth.<br>
Mayla Highmountain - Had Uul&apos;gyneth&apos;s plan succeeded, we all would have been made into servants of the Old Gods... including Ebonhorn.<br>
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - I shudder at the thought, Mayla. Without the swift action of Baine and this champion, all would have been lost.<br>
Mayla Highmountain - Baine Bloodhoof, you have demonstrated courage, honor, and loyalty. I believe it is time for your people and mine to renew our bonds of kinship.<br>
Mayla Highmountain - If you will have us, the tauren of Highmountain would be proud to join your Horde.<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - The Horde will be honored to welcome you! Let us travel to Orgrimmar and share the good news with our Warchief.<br>
<br>
<br>
Highmountain Tauren Join the Horde<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner, I present Chieftain Mayla Highmountain.<br>
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - What have you to say, chieftain?<br>
Mayla Highmountain - Warchief, the strength and courage of the Horde has been demonstrated by Baine Bloodhoof, as well as your champion.<br>
Mayla Highmountain - From this day forth, Highmountain vows to stand with you against all foes.<br>
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - I accept your oath of loyalty. The Horde offers its protection... and expects your obedience.<br>
Baine Bloodhoof - For the Horde!<br>
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - For the Horde!<br>
Mayla Highmountain - For the Horde!<br>
<br>
<br>
Highmountain Tauren Player Intro<br>
Mayla Highmountain - For many ages, our people have called the Broken Isles home. We know little about the Azeroth that exists beyond our shores.<br>
Mayla Highmountain - It is time we changed that.<br>
Mayla Highmountain - Today you begin a new journey. You will be our voice in the lands beyond the mountain.<br>
Mayla Highmountain - Go to Orgrimmar. Meet our new allies and learn what it is they care about... what they fight for.<br>
Mayla Highmountain - Stay true to who you are. And should you ever miss your home, know that Highmountain is here for you. Always.<br>
