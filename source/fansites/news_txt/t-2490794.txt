Crucible of Storms

The Restless Cabal

Fixed a bug that caused Enveloping Darkness https://www.wowdb.com/spells/287876-enveloping-darkness to be cast on players who accepted a combat resurrection.




Items

Fixed a bug that prevented the confirmation prompt to appear when enchanting an item that already had an enchantment on it.


Player versus Player

Resolved an issue that caused Gladiator's Maledict https://www.wowdb.com/items/165806-sinister-gladiators-maledict and Void Stone https://www.wowdb.com/items/167865-void-stone’s absorption shields to periodically refresh to full value while in Arenas.


Quests

Players will now take less damage during their encounter with Thyrinar during "Through a Glass, Darkly https://www.wowdb.com/quests/29194-through-a-glass-darkly”.
