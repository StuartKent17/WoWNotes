Immersive Sounds of Azeroth Panel
Near the end of the panel, the team mentioned that "Lady Waycrest has offered tribute and is waiting for you to find a little musical surprise." This is a possible hint to a secret in game.


The panel started out with David Arkenstone and a band playing Kul Tiran music.
Music often provides emotional guideposts in a story and can act as an anchor in a story arc.
David Rovin took over as sound supervisor for WoW a year ago. He says WoW has been a legend in the industry for some time.
Sound design should:

Make the player feel awesome by having their sounds be the loudest.
Help the player play the game by having audio cues such as aggro sounds.
Be immersive.

Audio on screen that is not directly in front of you is lowered to help you focus on what is right there in front of you.
Drustvar is a good example of sound design as work in game.
David Rovin leads a team of 6 sound designers for WoW.
Building an Ambience in 2004

Avoid sounds that create a noticeable loop.
Minimize disc space through sharing.

WoW Ambience Today

Simplified base layer.
Variation through one-shot randomization.
Content specific sounds.
More personality.

Drustvar purposely has some spooky sounds that are tied to the effigies in the trees.
Every creature has an aggro sound, attack sounds, and a death sound.
The team also adds creature ambient sounds to make them more alive.

Idle vocalizations
Iconic performance
Distant flavor kits
Weighs as much as a duck

Drustvar witch drust magic purposely has its own sound effects that differ from player magic sounds.
Certain areas in Drustvar purposely have different sounds, most of which are even creepier than the rest of the zone, such as the graveyard and throughout the Crimson Forest.
Music has a similar role as sound design in setting up a narrative or tone of a zone.
Abby Lewis Inspired Music of Drustvar.

Child-like and mysterious.
Classic horror, not jump scare.
A sense of history, twisted fairy tale.
Starting point, leaving room to develop.

Fallhaven - Tension Builder

Darker as you start to encounter bad things.
Drawing on orchestra techniques to sell tension.

Glenbrook Wood

Strong melody introduced early.
Reinforced though question experience leading to dungeon capper and central piece of the zone, Waycrest Manor.

Waycrest Manor

The pipe organ was used outside Waycrest Manor and the music becomes more muted.
Inside, the music is stronger.
Waycrest Manor was the most intense sound design that the team has ever created in WoW.
The organ becomes a character in itself.
It was interesting creating sound for a boss that had an actual organ involved in the fight.
When you kill a witch in the dungeon, you can actually hear the music play a cord that sounds as if Lady Waycrest is slamming her hands on the keys in anger.
Encounter logic for creature spawning is utilized in changing the music as well.
Dynamic Boss Encounter

Paying It All Off

Music changes by phase
Organ based spells
Final visit to musical themes
When Lady Waycrest joins the fight, the emitters turn off and the dungeon music raises. When she dies, the music ends for the dungeon.


Diegetic Audio

From "wallpaper music" to emanating in the world.
Responsive to players' actions.

"Lady Waycrest has offered tribute and is waiting for you to find a little musical surprise." Possible hint at secret in game?
There are some immersive sound changes coming to when you are mounted or on a flight path.
