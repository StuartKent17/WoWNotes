Upcoming Change to Argus Waystones and Invasion Points
I wanted to give you a heads up that we are currently testing a hotfix aimed at addressing some player concerns with Argus Waystones and Invasion Points.

First, will be removing the Argus Waystone currency entirely. Players who currently have Argus Waystones will be compensated with a small amount of Veiled Argunite. 

The weekly quests that previously required Argus Waystones will now require players to simply complete three Invasion Points.

We will also be increasing the cap on Veiled Argunite to 2,000 from 1,500, to make sure there are no issues with any of these changes - this will also act as a small quality of life increase for those of you seeing yourselves at the currency cap.

Thanks for all your feedback so far on Invasion Points, and we'll see you on Argus!


Waystones and Invasion Points
We have a hotfix in the works to the way Argus Waystones work for the weekly quest, Invasion Onslaught. This will likely be live with your weekly resets next week if all goes well. 

Early in 7.3 PTR, Argus Waystones were a requirement to enter Greater Invasion Points. We removed that requirement after hearing great feedback on it in PTR testing, but retained the waystones for Invasion Onslaught. Now weâ€™ve seen that after Invasion Points opened up, players have a lot of these stones left over with nothing to spend them on.

Therefore, the weekly quest Invasion Onslaught will be changed from 'collect 15 Argus Waystones' to 'complete 3 Invasion Points'. Argus Waystones will no longer be obtainable in the game, and any Argus Waystones on your character will be automatically converted into Veiled Argunite.

We hope this simplifies the quest and also stops our over-achieving ethereal currency collector from spamming your mailbox each day.

Again, we're working to hotfix this with weekly resets in each region starting on September 12.

Thank you for the feedback!

Follower Upgrades
You can buy Relinquished Armor Sets from Warmage Kath'leen on the Broken Shore for 400 Nethershards. These will instantly set a champion to item level 880. You might also find armor kits from treasure chests, rare elites and champion missions on Argus that will set a champion to item level 900.

I think you first need to level them up to 110. I tried to apply a 900 ilvl token to my last inactive follower, and was not allowed to use it till i leveled it to 110 was inactive on 109.
Yep, that's true, my bad for not mentioning it! You can also buy experience books for Nethershards too. Or use the champion as a combat ally if possible so that they get XP each time you complete a World Quest. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

This Week in WoW History
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.

Legion Companion App Released
Shortly after Legion launched, the Legion Companion App  was released! This app let players track world quests, complete missions, manage followers, research Order Hall talents, and do Artifact research. This was the first time users were able to interact with the game world from a mobile device outside of the Armory app, which allowed users to chat with their guild members and manage auctions. 


  


Kosumoth The Hungering Rare Spawn
Not too long after Legion went live, and some players made it to 110 they began trying to figure out how to summon Kosumoth the Hungering! This rare spawn has the chance to reward a mount or a pet from a weekly quest, depending on which is up. In order to unlock the world quest there is a series of orbs that must be clicked. You can find the full process listed below. 


  


Pet Battles: The Celestial Tournament
As Blizzard continued to implement more content in Mists of Pandaria, one of the things that they included was solid content for pet battles. This came in the form of the Celestial Tournament found on the Timeless Isle in the Jade Forest. In order to participate in the tournament, you had to have a certain number of pets leveled to 25. You could not heal or revive pets in between battles, making it even tougher! The tournament is still available on the Timeless Isle today, for those that are feeling brave enough to test their pet battle prowess. 


  


The Lorewalkers Faction Preview
In early September 2012 Blizzard gave us another preview from the upcoming Mists of Pandaria expansion; this time we got a look at the Lorewalker Faction, which was tied to the archaeology profession. By traveling through Pandaria to complete some of these lost artifacts, you could take them to Lorewalker Cho who would then tell you stories about those items, or the races they came from. It also offered a way to work on other archaeology projects by getting Restored Artifacts to trade for other types of archaeology fragments. There are titles and achievements you can still earn today, such as The Seat of Knowledge
