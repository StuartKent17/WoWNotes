The Alliance War Campaign will continue in Patch 8.1.5. Spoilers below<br>
<br>
<br>
The quest chain continues from Halford Wyrmbane with &quot;Loose Ends&quot;, which tasks you to find Kelsey Steelspark in the outdoor world version of Freehold.<br>
Kelsey asks you to kill 10 Ashvane Loyalists and find 5 clues in the quests &quot;Ashes to Ashvane&quot; and &quot;Correspondence Conundrum&quot;.<br>
You then are tasked with taking out the leader Haughton Francis for a cipher in the quest &quot;Getting a Clue&quot;. Kelsey sends you back to Halford (&quot;Reporting In&quot;).<br>
Valeera arrives with a message to Jaina that Baine wants to meet in secret to right a wrong Sylvanas has done to her family (&quot;Don&apos;t Shoot the Messenger&quot;). He has conspired against his Warchief to release the risen Derek Proudmoore back to his family, as Sylvanas was denying him free will and corrupting the honor of the Horde.<br>
Jaina reluctantly agrees to meet Baine in the ruins of Theramore (&quot;My Brother&apos;s Keeper&quot;), resulting in a cutscene. Derek reunites with his sister. She agrees to help him and mentions that she knows others who know what he is going through, presumably Calia Menethil.<br>
You are then tasked with doing a war table mission called &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot;. It lasts 4 days but can be reduced significantly with troops.<br>
Once the table mission completes, you receive &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot; and must meet with Kelsey at the Clearcut in Stormsong Valley. She tasks you with saving troops and collecting parts (&quot;Lost in the Field&quot;, Reassembly Required&quot;) and then protecting her on the hillside. (&quot;Seeking Higher Ground&quot;)<br>
You are sent to find Shaw in a nearby cave and then use a spyglass to witness Sylvanas arrest Baine, while Nathanos kills Zeling for their mutiny. (&quot;Shaw&apos;s Shank Redemption&quot;)<br>
Shaw has you report back to Jaina, who feels bad for Baine and hopes the Horde will now see Sylvanas for the monster that she is. (A Gathering of Foes&quot;)<br>

Patch 8.1.5 - Horde War Campaign<br>
The Horde War Campaign will continue in Patch 8.1.5.<br>
<br>
<br>
The quest chain continues from Bluffwatcher Proudscar, a Tauren near the docks, with the quest Righting Wrongs. This requires you to meet with Baine Bloodhoof at Plunder Harbor in Tiragarde Sound. <br>
When you arrive to meet Baine, you witness a conversation with Valeera Sanguinar where they discuss meeting someone at Thermaore Harbor. Baine then presents the quest Ships in the Night which tasks you with locating Derek Proudmoore. <br>
You board a small boat with Baine Bloodhoof and Thomas Zelling which sails to one of Sylvanas&apos;s ships, The Swift Vengeance. Here you grapple aboard, break in and find Derek Proudmoore unconscious in a cell. <br>
You will need to obtain three keys from various named crew members on the deck of the ship, and slay 9 crew members in the process. This is split between two quests, Under Lock and Keys and Dead in the Water. <br>
Once you have all three keys and have killed 9 crew members, turn the quests in at Baine and return to Derek Proudmoore in the hull, freeing him by clicking on the cage.<br>
Baine will give you the quest Bitter Reunion which requires you to speak with Thomas Zelling, who is located on the deck of the ship.<br>
Talking to Zelling will give you an option to set sail for Theramore, at which time Zelling will cast a spell that fills the ship&apos;s sails with wind.<br>
After a not-yet-implemented cinematic, you arrive on a small island off the coast of Theramore Harbor. Walk back on to the ship and turn in your quest to Baine. <br>
Thomas Zelling will give you the quest Under False Colors which requires you to complete a table mission called Casting the Bait. This mission is to trick Nathanos into believing that pirates stole The Swift Vengeance, not you, Baine and Zelling. <br>
Zelling also gives you a Charm of Returning which when used returns you directly to the Port of Zandalar. <br>
Once back at the Port of Zandalar, complete the table mission Casting the Bait, then talk to Nathanos Blightcaller to complete the quest. <br>
Dark Ranger Alina, near Nathanos, will then give you a quest called Securing Warfang Hold. Set sail for Stormsong Valley.<br>
Once you have arrived at Warfang Hold, talk to Boss Mida, a goblin. She will present two quests, Spy Games and Communication Breakdown, which require you to destroy three SI:7 communication devices and slay 10 SI:7 spys. <br>
Mida&apos;s personal assistant, Kazit, will also present a quest named Tickets, Please? which will require you to eject five visiting spectators that do not have tickets.<br>
When all three quests are complete, return to Mida and receive the quest A Display of Power.<br>
Speak to Nathanos Blightcaller to witness the meeting of leaders at Warfang Hold in a cutscene. <br>
