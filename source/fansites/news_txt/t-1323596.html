Patch 5.4 - Multiple Raid Finder Queues<br>
Patch 5.4 will finally allow you to queue for multiple Raid Finder wings at once, as the string from the last PTR build hinted at: ERR_LFG_REASON_TOO_MANY_LFG - You are queued for too many instances.<br>

World PvP and Item Levels<br>
World PvP is inherently imbalanced. The reality is that a &quot;fair&quot; fight rarely happens. Someone gets the drop on the other, or is already in combat, or not at full health, or has friends with them... the list goes on. We&apos;re not convinced that gear has a terribly significant impact in the vast majority of world PvP.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re also not convinced that, even in the cases where you are on an even playing field, there&apos;s nothing you can do if you&apos;re constantly losing. World of Warcraft is an MMORPG -- a social game. Part of the point of playing on a PvP server is making friends and allies that can bail you out when you&apos;re in trouble. If you don&apos;t want to play that way, that&apos;s fine, but that&apos;s why we have PvE servers available.<br>
<br>
That said, we also get why it&apos;s frustrating when you feel like you could have beaten somebody if only you had those few extra item levels. We&apos;d like to fix that, but it&apos;s not in the cards for 5.4.

PvP<br>
how many season remains before the next expansion? 2? the season 15 is actually not in ptr but exist.<br>
We haven&apos;t decided yet. Might depend on how the 5.4 season goes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356122483293814784))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
4/12. In cataclysm each raid tier was out long enough for us to slowly work through it. Faster release in mop makes that hard<br>
Yes, this is a problem w/ faster pace. We either have to nerf content a lot or you have to move on without finishing a tier. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355777246620942339))<br>
<br>
Why shouldn&apos;t they have faster progression? In TBC, my guild was in SSC/TK when top guilds were in BT. I was fine with that.<br>
If you&apos;re talking about the same difficulty tier, sure. SSC/TK was all one difficulty. We have (Jeez) six now. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357385077744877568))<br>
Honestly? That&apos;s too many. I know you&apos;re trying to cater to everyone, but it makes difficulty feel artificial.<br>
I dunno. Halo and Civilization have a lot of difficulty levels. It&apos;s a traditional inclusive mechanic. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357518959513309184))<br>
<br>
It&apos;s a bit complex as Heroics slid down in the order of progression with LFR. Some legit points I think.<br>
I often wonder if harder heroic dungeons would work if there was no matchmaking, like heroic scenarios. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355776849881726977))<br>
People are using add-ons to bypass the lack of match-making on heroic scenarios now.<br>
Are you talking like Open Raid? We dig stuff like that overall. A pug isn&apos;t random matchmaking. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356131909308399617))<br>
A pug has a leader who can invite or kick or make rules. You choose to live with that or find another group. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356132092255535105))<br>
In terms of game health, social groups &gt; pugs &gt; random matchmaking &gt; not grouping at all. That last bit is why LFR exists. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356132376365113345))<br>
<br>
I just wondering, why devs are considering 25ppls as more epic? Crowd = mess, not epic.<br>
Speaking personally, I like the fiction that the boss is so powerful that it takes a huge army of heroes to bring him or her down. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356131084431405057))<br>
<br>
I&apos;m split when it comes to TFgear. It&apos;s just too random and can effect progression between two guilds. Otherwise yea it&apos;s good<br>
It doesn&apos;t affect progression that much. Not getting a weapon at all has a much bigger impact than someone getting a TF weapon. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351122132266262529))<br>
Thats a problem in 10 man raids. TF loots dont drop so often and when they drop sometimes no one can use it.<br>
We think that&apos;s a good thing though. Loot was more interesting when everyone didn&apos;t have the expectation of BiS every tier. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351131192055169024))<br>
In effect what your saying is that PROGRESSION (i.e loot) was more interesting when only fewer people did it<br>
No, it just felt more special to get loot when your 40 player raid got 2-3 items. The rates are like 4x that now. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352112942851948547))<br>
That leads to the expectation of getting all BiS, which further makes any non BiS worth passing over instead of nice items. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352113213535551488))<br>
<br>
will there be an easy worldboss in 5.4 as well?<br>
Yes. We&apos;ve tried to have an easy boss and a harder boss each patch, but Oondasta and Galleon ended up being too zergable. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351119941304463360))<br>
<br>
Raid Finder<br>
Are there any plans to help remedy the issue of rampant widespread rudeness in LFR/LFG?<br>
What are you thinking? Some kind of +1 reward if a player is a decent human being? (Not joking.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350819228540084226))<br>
<br>
Do you believe making raid content accessible via LFR reduces sense of achievement, communication &amp; social skills?<br>
I think those are all downsides for LFR. Those aren&apos;t reasons to kill the feature, i.e. it has upsides too. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356174038990716930))<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t think the last part is addressed by LFR in anyway. Essentially its a loot pinata with zero communication.<br>
But players are seeing the content and spending time raiding instead of not doing that. Sans LFR they&apos;d just log out. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356171254643965952))<br>
<br>
Flex Difficulty<br>
it&apos;s fun to play palatank with haste i think all agrees but what about dps stuff that tanks take away from dps? lot of times<br>
Loot is personal in LFR and someday will be in dungeons. That just leaves organized raids, and you guys can work it out there. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352098224770789376))<br>
so you&apos;re saying flex will use normal raid loot in future? Or will it use LFR loot system.<br>
We don&apos;t know yet. Perhaps we&apos;ll let the raid leader decide which loot model to use. Flex uses LFR loot for 5.4 though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355449441769095168))<br>
I don&apos;t see there being much attraction to flex if the loot isn&apos;t even close to normal mode ilvl.<br>
If you&apos;re capable of doing Normal, than Flex really isn&apos;t targeted at you. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355485932239069184))<br>
Flex is for groups with erratic raid schedules, unstable rosters and so on. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355486036337496065))<br>
That&apos;s very sad to hear. Been doing N10 since ICC, but we value friends over progress so it&apos;s a struggle. Currently 4/16.<br>
If you value friends over progression, then you might be a good candidate for Flex. Maybe give it a shot? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355777524858499072))<br>
Flex raid is just you throwing us the leftover bones as if we were dogs.. We wanted N raiding tuned for N raiders<br>
Maybe we should rename Normal. I think some of you are getting hung up on the name. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355779213074239489))<br>
In my opinion it&apos;s that the name didn&apos;t change while N. raids now are almost like H. from Wrath.<br>
And this is where flex comes in. If you liked ICC 10s, then Flex is for you. If you liked Cataclysm 10s, then normal is for you. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355803564641234944))<br>
That isn&apos;t really true of 25s, which are about the same as they&apos;ve always been. We did make 10s harder since they drop same ilvl. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355803407023472640))<br>
How do you feel that&apos;s worked out? Was it worth the cost? (eg. fractured community, no casual-mode until Flex, etc.).<br>
Not sure it was the right call TBH. Maybe the ICC model was better. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356933435794792449))<br>
<br>
How fast/slow are you planning to open Flex for SoO compared to LFR?<br>
Not sure yet. We&apos;d like for it to be sooner though. We want flex to seem more attractive to someone on the fence. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356174175137824769))<br>
<br>
Dungeons<br>
outdoor dungeons are 1 thing I miss about classic, are the dino isle and timeless island an attempt at bringing them back?<br>
Siege was pretty much an outdoor dungeon. Or is that not what you meant? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356174307401015296))<br>
<br>
Would need options b/c folks are used to H-Dungeons for valor. Take away speed, back to Cata<br>
Right. That was the problem with Cata -- matchmaking and no alternatives. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355779862109229059))<br>
But hard+organized = loot efficient with easier+matchmaking = less loot efficient could work. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355779985182691328))<br>
<br>
you mean challenge modes?<br>
Well, Challenge Modes with gear. Random matchmaking doesn&apos;t work when tight coordination is required. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355779635188989953))<br>
<br>
If heroics are so simple, stop calling them heroics. Make 90 dungs base, add non-matchmaking heroic setting w/good items.<br>
I&apos;m not sure either the dungeon nor raid difficulty names are good ones. But renaming them all can be pretty confusing too. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355805529702014976))<br>
<br>
I know its not popular opinion, but l loved the cata heroics. Couldn&apos;t stick to std rotations.<br>
I liked Cata heroics (though a couple were still overtuned) but they worked for guilds not pugs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355804311218962433))<br>
why did you not like cata heroic randoms? You act like we just cant complete it.<br>
The success rate overall was not good. In the absence of alternatives it meant a lot of players had no content. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356130109251526657))<br>
I hoped players would rise to the occasion. Recall my &quot;dungeons are hard&quot; blog. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356130281163464705))<br>
But that was naive of me in a world of random matchmaking for hard content. The two aren&apos;t compatible. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356130470133637121))<br>
Now, a good pug with a strong leader isn&apos;t the same as random matchmaking mind you. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356130584206118913))<br>
