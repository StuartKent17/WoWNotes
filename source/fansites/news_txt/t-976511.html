Update - Looks like the escapist took the article down, probably went up earlier than expected. <br>

Rogue Legendary and Patch 4.3<br>
Another interview (http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112981-WoW-Producer-Discusses-Killing-Deathwing-Raid-Finder-and-Everything-Patch-4-3) showed up today in The Escapist. The most important part is the Rogue Legendary dagger and new raid level difficulty, but the important points are all below.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rogues will get a legendary dagger and exciting quest line to go with it. The lore for the dagger has not been decided upon yet.<br>
Looking for Raid tool raids will be easier than normal raids using a new level of difficulty (Looking For Raid).<br>
The Looking for Raid tool will only work for 25 man raids, not 10 man.<br>
Players will get different achievements and loot from doing Random Raid mode, no normal mode achievements or perks will be gained.<br>
This will introduce players to the content and mechanics of the fights so that they are more prepared for an actual raid.<br>
The new five mans will have tighter story integration with the Deathwing Raid than Icecrown Heroics did.<br>
The Dragonflights will work together to help take down Deathwing.<br>
Deathwing&apos;s random zone burning will continue at least until the end of Patch 4.3.<br>
They might be talking about Pandas at Blizzcon.<br>
