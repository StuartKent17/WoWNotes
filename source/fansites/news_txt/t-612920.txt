Today's mount ... isn't really a mount actually. In the current build of the WotLK beta, people dying in Storm Peaks are resurrected on a ghost flying mount http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/august/spectralgryphon.jpg ! Running to your corpse could be very hard in a region with so many mountains and developpers solved it by giving you a very nice mount. Obviously, its only purpose is to make corpse running easier in the zone and it fades off once you're back among the living.

Lake Wintergrasp Upcoming Changes
We’re hoping to get the zone into better shape in the next couple patches. Here’s a few things that should be coming in the next build:

• All vehicles should be despawn after the battle ends
• Demolisher and Siege Vehicle health has been reduced by 50-75%
• Demolisher and Siege Vehicle ram attacks no longer knock a player high enough to kill them
• Jet & Bomber health has been reduced
• Bomber damage has been increased
• Players in Bombers should no longer take damage
• Reward for holding the keep has been added
• The Goblin Workshops in the North and South now also supply players with land mines that deal bonus damage to tanks

We also hope to have a system for rewarding only players that participated in the battle working soon.

Profession recipes collection achievements
We're working on the ability to do these kind of achievements. We wouldn't do anything percentage based but rather choose a flat number and add more achievements as we add more content.

Most likely, you'll see a cooking version like this in the near future. Versions for the primary professions won't go live until account-based achievements are active. We don't want to encourage people picking up and dropping profressions simply to gain achievements. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/9244877181-profession-recipe-collection.html

Feats of Strength - Spirit of Competition 2008
Great idea. We implemented two Feats... one for the Tabard and one for the Pet. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/9336453693-suggestion-spirit-of-competition-08-feat.html

Anticipation / Shamanistic Focus changes / Windfury concerns
One change we're doing to Anticipation is changing it to 3-points, and giving it disarm reduction. We are also most likely going to change Shamanistic Focus to make it a flat mana reduction in shock cooldowns. It's too spammy right now, and the class has too many on proc buffs.

Edit: BTW, one thing I totally agree with is the Windfury Weapon concern. We'll see if we can make the ability less complicated/"mathy".

Furious Attacks
This talent will see some revision before retail so don't worry about a world where warriors are dual wielding daggers for MS bonanzas. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/9023731954-furious-attacks-overpowered.html
