I'm sure a lot of people want to take a close look at Algalon, especially with Patch 3.1.3 going live in the upcoming weeks/days with a few changes to Mimiron's encounters. The first video is the kill by Apathy  EU-Vek'nilash.

Pet scaling
We think it's probably time to let pets scale, to some extent, with resilience and spell pen.

The way pets scale from the master's stats was implemented on our side in a slightly clunky way which made it difficult to add additional stats. In BC, it took some effort to kill a pet so it wasn't a burning problem for us. In LK, we have bumped up pet health a few times, but we are thinking now that the balance will never work right without some crit mitigation. Pets will never scale right with gear as long as the master improves in ways that don't benefit the pet.

We have a new way to let pets scale, and assuming it works, we should be able to give the pets scale with all relevant stats from the master, from hit to haste to crit. Some things will need to scale at 100%, since it's silly to have your pet inherit part of your +hit.

No promises until you actually see it live, but that's what we are thinking at the moment. Source 

Formulas changes
We change a lot of numbers every expansion. You should not assume that everything stays the same when we raise the level cap. Some formulae will still work with accepted numbers, but you may want to re-test others.

We generally support the players working to figure out exactly how everything works. That has been a big part of the WoW community since the inception. We think it takes some of the magic out of the game when everything is completely laid bare. However, sometimes the formulae we use are so arcane that we feel like it is appropriate to give the theorycrafters a peek behind the curtain. We did so with armor penetration and the new Arena reating calculations recently, and now with rage. In this case some players were assuming that rage generation was stealth nerfed recently so we wanted to clearly set the record straight. Source

Resto druids in Arenas
While we were succesful getting Resto druids into tree form in Arena, we were a little too succesful. We're not sure it's fun for either the druid or the people trying to kill the druid to be locked in tree form all the time. This change will hopefully make the fights a little more dynamic. Source

Single target healing
An apparent "double standard" exists because the game has far fewer healing specs than damage specs. Most 25-player raids are going to have a diversity of healers so it's okay in our minds for them to have more discrete niches. While there are many fights where single-target damage is not particularly useful, there are very, very few fights that are not tanked, and therefore where single-target healing is not particularly useful. Besides, while the paladin niche may be single-target healing, when I look at raid stats, nearly all of them are managing to heal people besides the MT. I've run 10-player raids with 2 paladin healers plenty of times. It works fine. Source

AoE Ability added to Rogues in WotLK
Most trash pulls in Naxx used AE almost exlcusively. Being a single-target damage-dealer, and one with combo points no less, felt just terrible. Yeah, I know "nobody cares about trash." Except they do. Rogues and at the time other specs with sub-par AE dps wondered why anyone would want to bring them when the raid leader could speed up the whole raid by bringing someone who could AE. There are adds on some of the boss fights too and we knew that many of the upcoming Ulduar fights would have a lot of AE opportunities too.

We feel these days like "I bring the best AE!" is not a strong niche. Likewise, it felt archaic to say that some characters just had to sit around while everyone else AE'd those big packs down. Source

Heroic Strike in WotLK
In BC, Heroic Strike was a decision. You used it when you needed to vent off excess rage. The problem in LK is that the excess rage situation is almost 100% of the time, so Heroic Strike isn't a decision anymore. We need to fix it. Source 

FAILOC-ALYPSE!
If you tried to get Blizzcon tickets yesterday you might have noticed a link to a small game at the bottom of the waiting page .... FAILOC-ALYPSE! ! That's 20 minutes of my life I'm never getting back.
