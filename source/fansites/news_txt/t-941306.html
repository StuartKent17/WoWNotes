<br>
Patch 4.2 Hotfixes - July 19<br>
July 19<br>
<br>
General<br>
<br>
The frequency at which players can use /yell, /say, and any emotes is now throttled to prevent excessive spamming of chat logs from occurring.<br>
<br>
<br>
Classes<br>
Death Knights<br>
<br>
Improved Death Strike now provides 40/80/120% bonus damage, up from 30/60/90%, and a 10/20/30% critical strike bonus, up from 3/6/9%.<br>
<br>
<br>
Druids<br>
<br>
Flight Form now cancels the Leyara&#x2019;s Locket buff.<br>
Moonfire will now generate Lunar Energy when crossing from Solar to Lunar on the Eclipse bar.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br>
<br>
All bosses in The Bastion of Twilight, Blackwing Descent, and Throne of the Four Winds once again award Valor Points in all raid sizes and difficulties. 10-player bosses award 35 Valor Points, while 25-player bosses award 45 Valor Points. This change does not apply to Argaloth in Baradin Hold. More information can be found here.<br>
<br>
Firelands<br>
<br>
Superheated cannot be cast on players, even if they attack the Flamewaker Animators as they are channeling energy towards the Unstable Magma.<br>
Alysrazor<br>
[list]<br>
Collecting Blazing Power now refreshes Wings of Flame to its full duration each time.<br>
Alysrazor will now always face the correct direction during Firestorm.<br>
Imprinted should now be cleared from characters under all conditions when the encounter resets.<br>
Interacting with a Molten Feather will now dismount characters, preventing the feather from being wasted.<br>
<br>
Beth&#x2019;tilac<br>
<br>
Beth&apos;tilac will now only eat spiderlings that move very close to her (the range on her ability to consume them has been reduced). In addition, eaten spiderlings will no longer sometimes remain on the ground or on players once she consumes them.<br>
Drones should no longer evade or aggro characters on top of the web.<br>
Fixate now truly fixates on random targets.<br>
<br>
Ragnaros<br>
<br>
On 25-player Heroic difficulty, Cloudbursts will now always properly apply Deluge to 3 players before fading away.<br>
It should always be possible to interact with Cloudbursts, even if several players click on one at the same time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Heroic bind-on-equip items now sell to vendors for gold.<br>
<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Arenas<br>
<br>
A resolution has been put into place which should help alleviate Rated Battleground matchmaking delays. This fix corrects an issue that could occur if a team at the front of the queue was particularly difficult to match, resulting in a bottleneck which slowed matchmaking for all players in queue. More information can be found here.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quests &amp; Creatures<br>
<br>
The melee evasion angle of several creatures has been adjusted. Most notably, melee classes should no longer be seeing abilities, such as Backstab or Shred, getting parried when standing well enough out of Ragnaros&#x2019;s melee evasion angle, or other bosses/creatures with similar evasion angles.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Season Transition Compensation Action - Hotfix<br>
Around 50% of the intended recipients did not receive the 4000 honor that they should have with today&#x2019;s maintenance. We&#x2019;re in the process of scheduling an off-peak maintenance early tomorrow morning to correct that and deliver the remaining compensation packages.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the hiccup, we&#x2019;ll get them to you soon. <br>
<br>
<br>
WoWArmory Facebook Application Closing<br>
We&apos;re in the process of deploying a new, open World of Warcraft Web API, which among other functions will provide a more fully-featured replacement for the existing WoWArmory website. Over the past few months we&#x2019;ve been working with our partners and fansites to help them migrate away from using WoWArmory.com, and on August 2 we will decommission it, as well as the WoWArmory Facebook application.<br>
<br>
When the Facebook application is turned off, users who installed it will no longer see it in their list of Facebook applications. They will also no longer have the ability to access Facebook pages that were associated with the application, and all news feed entries created by it will be removed.<br>
<br>
Our hope is that through the new Web API, we can encourage a broad range of community-created features like the WoWArmory application, and are excited to see what else can be done by opening this information up to application and website developers. If you have any questions or comments about this change, please refer to our World of Warcraft Community Platform API forum here: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/2626217/<br>

Tier 11 Instance Valor Points Change<br>
The change is that instead of chain-running troll dungeons to cap VP they have an additional option. Adding that additional option doesn&apos;t suddenly make the valor rewards more accessible. Especially because the option that&apos;s being added is entirely less accessible than what&apos;s been available this entire time.<br>
<br>
You can make an argument that current tier shouldn&apos;t be available for purchase with Valor at all, that&apos;s a valid opinion to state. But that&apos;s a different topic.<br>
<br>
What you&apos;re saying is that by us adding additional but less accessible ways (raids) to obtain VP that it somehow makes the rewards less meaningful than they were when people could &apos;only use Dungeon Finder&apos; to get them. Sorry but that just doesn&apos;t make any sense.

<br>
Arena Boosting<br> 
If by that you mean that you pay someone gold to join their team or they join yours and you all participate in Arenas, etc... together while they&apos;ll help you get to a higher rating because they are far more skilled than you? No, in and of itself that is not a violation of our policies.

<br>
Acquiring PvP Gear when you reach level 85<br>
What Aarschott explained to you does make sense. Level-85 PvP gear is intended to be earned and awarded to level-85 players. There is too much potential to &quot;game&quot; the system and stockpile really powerful gear so that you&apos;re fully equipped when you hit 85, if we were to allow you to buy level-85 gear with Honor you earned below the level cap.<br>
<br>
The same applies for PvE gear. If you want powerful endgame items, you need to earn them via playing through endgame content. <br>
<br>
Why don&apos;t you want a player having honor gear the second he/she hits 85? It&apos;s not necessarily good entertainment to go and get your butt kicked repeatedly in BGs for 150 sessions before you can begin to compete.<br>
There are crafted items available to level-85 players which will help them substantially when first setting foot into Battlegrounds or Tol Barad. Getting a hold of this gear isn&apos;t too difficult.<br>
<br>
The fact is that endgame progression is its own experience. Leveling is a very direct and obvious act of progression, but that changes when players hit the cap. Progression then trends much more toward itemization -- you have to participate in the endgame experience to get more powerful gear. But as I said, there is underrated entry-level crafting gear which can be very useful for helping to ease PvP-oriented players into level-85 Battlegrounds.

<br>
OK, then why do we start earning Justice Points at 70? We can stockpile them till we have 4K; so if this really is your reasoning, why don&apos;t we get our JP/Honor wiped when we ding 85? I mean we didn&apos;t earn them doing endgame content, why should we be able to buy a few pieces of gear with them?<br>
No, that&apos;s exactly the point of the design. If you enjoy doing some leveling via Battlegrounds, you&apos;re afforded the opportunity to buy up to two pieces of epic item level 371 PvP gear when you hit 85. You can then use gold and/or crafting materials to fill out just about every other slot, plus use enchantments, gems, and reforging to get your character into a competitive state for collecting additional epic Honor gear.

OMG NO SHAMAN IN PARAGON&apos;S RAGNAROS KILL!!!&#xA7;&#xA7;&#xA7;111<br>
It doesn&apos;t matter at all unless you can verify and prove that Heroic Ragnaros is impossible, or way more difficult to kill, when a specific class or specialization is represented in the raid.<br>
<br>
You&apos;re forcing together a couple of incredibly fragmented pieces of data -- and the sample size of that tested data is 25 players in the whole world fighting one boss in the entire game -- to extrapolate an entire thesis on class balance.<br>
<br>
No one is going to benefit from trying to make an argument out of this. <br>
<br>
And why do you think the world first guilds continue to not bring any Shamans. Is it because they&apos;re in such a good place right now they didn&apos;t want people to complain that they were class stacking Shamans because of how amazing they are?<br>
<br>
This is the 3rd world first end boss kill in the past 3 patches where there was not ONE DPS Shaman in the raid makeup (And only one Resto Shaman in the past 3 world first end boss kills). You can keep saying EVERY new patch that they can bring what they want and that there is nothing that you can do, but you should really look at why they aren&apos;t bringing one class every single time.<br>
That&apos;s a pretty ineffective way to consider class balance. It&apos;s as though you&apos;re suggesting the answer to perceived shaman woes is for us to buff them until the top guilds in the world must bring them to their raids for world first kills. That&apos;s a vacuum in which class balance should never work.<br>
<br>
One thing you&apos;re certainly not doing is counting all of the kills of each of the Heroic bosses which followed the world firsts. Shaman have certainly been present for Heroic boss kills in Cataclysm, but that data doesn&apos;t support your argument. You want to focus on, what, four total boss kills over the last eight months? Out of tens of thousands of Heroic boss kills which have occurred globally since Cataclysm, do you really think you&apos;re presenting a fair case?
