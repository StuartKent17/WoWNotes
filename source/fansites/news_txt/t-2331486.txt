The boss design team came up with the mechanics for the first boss for Shrine of the Storms right on stage!

Giant Water Elemental Boss


Boss starts as full water elemental but descends into shadow.
Boss has 3 abilities in A phase then moves to B phase and splits into smaller adds 2 or more
Killing Adds hurts his health bar as well
Will add spawn locations be RNG based? Is this fight mean to melee?
Dungeon as a whole is considered. Different bosses in dungeons test the different members of the party.
Some sort of party damage to test healer: maybe a tank crush mechanic or a raid wide dot? Something shadow based!
Impossible to design a fight that caters to every role. Make sure certain abilities aren't mandatory.
Court of Stars is used as a reference for dungeons in Battle for Azeroth.
Potential mechanic that absorbs a random party member into his body who needs to be dpsed out.
Shadow pools on the ground will either help you from getting pushed off the platform or hinder you.
Some boss designs focus on visually stunning mechanics and events.
