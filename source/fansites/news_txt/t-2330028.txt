World PVP

World PvP ruleset hasn't really changed since 2005. 
There are two main audiences: Players on PvP servers because that is where they ended up that don't really want to be there. There are also players that love world PvP and want more of it. 
The PvP vs PvE server division is going away, replaced by an individual toggle. You can choose if you want to opt in to PvP or not when you are in town. Players that feel trapped on PvP servers have a way out. This opens up the game to changing and improving the world PvP ruleset. 
New content like bounty hunting or assassination quests will become an option. 
There will be bonuses to experience, reputation and other things when you are questing with PvP mode enabled to offset the inefficiency.
Building a foundation to make World PvP great again.
