chaud2019-06-11, 10:46 PMA New and Exciting Beginning
Deciding to close several of the Curse community websites wasn’t an easy decision for our company, but we could no longer justify the substantial engineering resources it took to run the properties. No one in our office wanted to see MMO-Champion shut down, so we carefully searched for a solution. 

We are happy to announce that we have been able to identify a company with the necessary experience to buy and run these sites including MMO-Champion, so that the passionate communities will continue to have homes on these long-standing sites. With this, we have started to transfer the sites to Magic Find. As for the staff on these sites, it will be up to them and Magic Find to decide how they’d like to move forward.

It’s a new and exciting beginning for MMO-Champion. We wish Magic Find the best as we say goodbye to several of the properties that helped our company grow into what it is today.

This will be the last update from Curse/Fandom. All future communications will be from the new site owner.
