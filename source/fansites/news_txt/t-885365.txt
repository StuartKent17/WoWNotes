Boubouille2011-04-12, 07:00 AMPatch 4.1 Dungeon Call To Arms Interface/Mechanics
A lot of people still wonder how the dungeon Call to Arms works and I hopped on PTRs to check it out. 



When the Call To Arms is active for a role, a gold circle will appear around the icon and Satchel of Exotic Mysteries  will be an extra reward.
Satchel of Exotic Mysteries  is the bag containing the extra reward with a low chance of mount/pet and will be bound on account. See Dungeon Finder Call to Arms - Clarification 
Call to Arms for more than one role can be active at a time.
If everything seems balanced, there isn't any Call to Arms. 




 

 


Rated Battlegrounds VS. The Blues
It looks like the lack of blue posts lately is because the blues have been spending most of their time training in PvP! 
Greetings Once Again!

I know a lot of you had fun a couple weeks back when we logged on to the PTRs and ran ZA & ZG with you. Well, we're coming back! This time however rather than fighting alongside you we're going to be duking it out on the fields of honor, better known as Rated Battlegrounds!

We're going to be online tomorrow, 4/12/2011, at 4:30pm PST.

To participate you'll need to roll Horde characters we flipped a coin and form teams on the Broxigar PTR realm. The reason we're specifying a faction is because this is actually a big test of our experimental same-faction rated battlegrounds.

Hope to see you online, I'm sure this'll be a blast!
