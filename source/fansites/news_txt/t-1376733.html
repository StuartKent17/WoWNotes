SoCal Punk Legends Blink-182 to Close Out Blizzcon 2013<br>
Thousands of gamers are about to come to a party and celebrate all the big things (and all the small things too) . . . and maybe even fall in love with a gnome at a rock show when legendary Southern California punk rock trio Blink-182 headlines the closing concert at Blizzard Entertainment&#x2019;s sold-out BlizzCon&#xAE; gaming convention, taking place November 8&#x2013;9 at the Anaheim Convention Center.<br>
<br>
Acclaimed worldwide for their influential and groundbreaking pop-punk sound, Blink-182 has achieved massive critical and commercial success, with over 35 million albums sold. Their third album, Enema of the State, went quintuple platinum and catapulted the band into superstardom.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for fans of Blink-182&#x2019;s &#x201C;What&#x2019;s My Age Again (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7l5ZeVVoCA)?&#x201D; video, Anaheim city ordinances strictly forbid the band from running naked through the streets around the convention center. BlizzCon attendees are kindly asked to adhere to the same policy.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;After two days of hard work watching games and playing games and talking about games, we can&#x2019;t think of a better way to kick back and relax than to have your face melted by Blink-182,&#x201D; said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re thrilled to have such an awesome band helping us bring BlizzCon to an epic conclusion.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Nothing beats touring and playing in front of a live crowd,&#x201D; said Tom DeLonge, Blink-182 guitarist and vocalist. &#x201C;Our roots are in Southern California, so playing at BlizzCon will be like having a show in our own backyard&#x2014;only with a couple thousand more orcs and elves in loincloths and bikini armor.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
BlizzCon is a celebration of the global player communities surrounding Blizzard Entertainment&#x2019;s Warcraft&#xAE;, Diablo&#xAE;, and StarCraft&#xAE; game universes.
