Racials
Noticing undead racials only ones useless to healers, any plans to change that? Touch of grave restore mana on heal cast etc?
Yeah, Undead for Healers is on our list to look at. Celestalon 

do races still have bonuses to professions or has that been removed?
They still have them. Celestalon 

What's the logic behind making Arcane Torrent give pally's 1 HP, but priests & monks 3% mana?
It's 1 Chi for Monks, and Priests have no secondary resource. Celestalon 

Classes
with all this changes its safe to say that encounters will be tunned for low burst/low inevitable damage?
LowER damage, yes. We'll tune around healers' potential. There's still room for scary burst moments, with time to recover after. WatcherDev 

Sorry if you answered, but what is the reason for less crit on int users, but more on agi?
Fits their theme better, and is consistent with how they have been for 9+ years. Celestalon 

Bigger change: Active mitigation for tanks in Cata/MoP, or coming healer changes in WoD?
Active Mitigation for tanks. That fundamentally changed how you tank; healing changes are more about pace. WatcherDev 

small question , if I may - on Garrosh kills, often tank contributes a /huge/ amnt of dmg, certainly in phase one.. how 1/2
Tank damage will still be significant, as described in the paragraph above Resolve. We're increasing their base damage. Celestalon 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Will repeated Rune Taps and Strike increase the size of the Rune Shield like Blood Shield currently?
Yes, successive Rune Strikes and Rune Taps add to the size of a Rune Shield. Celestalon 

More! Frost DK, Perks improve Razorice/Cinderglacier, 2h currently uses neither favoring Fallen Crusader. Changing that?
Yeah, we're going to try mixing up which runeforges Frost uses. Realize that that's a big change, and what you see isn't enough. Celestalon 
Interesting. Going to be a playstyle thing, or more "x rune required for x type of fight"?
Current plan is Cinderglacier for 2H, Cinderglacier+Razorice for DW. Definitely not set in stone. Celestalon 

Blood DK 3 shields? Blood Shield, Rune Shield & Rune Tap shield?
Rune Shield is one shield shared by Rune Tap huge and Rune Strike tiny. Celestalon 
Rune Strike just provides a more frequent, steady stream of little shields. Celestalon 
I personally was a huge fan of the reactive active mitigation that DKs had
It's still there. It's done transparently through Resolve, instead of being an opaque mechanic specific to DStrike Celestalon 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Will ravage feral still need facing requirement? Nice change for ambush, backstab, and shred BTW.
I believe it is the same for ravage. holinka 
Yes, same for Ravage. I'll get that added to the notes. Celestalon 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Any chance of survival becoming a multi-dot spec?
You can apply Serpent Sting on multiple mobs, so it is in a way. Celestalon 

Disarm Trap. Just the spell is being removed? Or the entire ability to disarm traps e.g., by right-clicking on them?
Disarm Trap completely removed. Detect Trap is staying for now. Reasoning is because of the PvP disarmament. Celestalon 

skimmed hunter sections of notes, can't help but feel gutted. Lots of utility gone; just another dps in the crowd.
You are the only ranged DPS class who can do everything on the move, for starters. What are the main abilities you'll miss? WatcherDev 
Scatter S & Distracting S are big, Widow Venom less so. Silence S gone include Counter S? HMark nice flavor but not critical.
What is the everyday use of Distracting Shot that you're going to miss most? WatcherDev 

Distracting shot is the only thing I'll miss... so nice on Heroic LK 25 solo to get the adds on me so I won't be dropped off 
That's something we can and will fix on the encounter logic side. WatcherDev 

Scatter S & Distracting S are big, Widow Venom less so. Silence S gone include Counter S? HMark nice flavor but not critical.
No, you keep Counter Shot. Scatter/Silence were removed as part of overall CC disarmament. Nearly everyone lost something. WatcherDev 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Will the new Mirror Images mimic mage's spell casting or just cast filter spells? If mimic, big DPS CD; if not, very weak.
It's a big DPS CD. They cast spec-appropriate spells, and hit hard. Celestalon 
So they have a set rotation but won't mimic your own spell casting?
Correct. Celestalon 

Flameglow also feels like something we'd never use, not sure if you have any plans to modify it, or just leave it as is.
Flameglow shines in the case where you're taking frequent little hits of damage. Celestalon 

PoM... what will we use it with? AB? Maybe we could make it give us some kind of buff, or do something different?
Mostly Arcane Blast. Occasionally a couple other things. Celestalon 
You didn't consider changing it, or just cutting it? High-haste AB... it'll be useless, not sure why we're keeping it.
It's definitely not useless... Faster, and usable while moving. Celestalon 

Sad that evo is arcane-only now. I liked the glyph as fire.
Glyph boils down to a cooldown-heal, which is cool and I liked too. Doesn't necessarily need to be tied to evoc. Muffinus 
How do fire/frost regen mana?
Do you find yourself low on mana at any point nowadays? Making mana more interesting would be great, big change tho Muffinus 
I like the evo-heal as a PvP mage, too. But hey I'll get over it 
We turned the Glyph of Evocation heal into Glyph of Ice Block, which attaches that same heal to Ice Block. Celestalon 
Is that Ice Block heal an HOT cancel Ice Block early, no full heal, or instant?
Same HoT as Glyph of Evo had. Celestalon 
any way to counter that? At least on live, we can kick/cc the evo. Maybe allow MD to remove block and heal?
Mass Dispel does break Ice Block in 6.0. Celestalon 

Do Frost bomb pulses triggered by Ice Lance still snare targets?
No. Celestalon 

really hoping for some clarification on what brain freeze is getting turned into
Still going to make it treat the target as frozen, and increase damage. Celestalon 

Incanter's Flow is: 5-10-15-20-25-20-15-10-5 and back up, or does it go down to 0?
5-10-15-20-25-25-20-15-10-5-repeat. Yes, that may be OP compared to Rune at current tuning. Tuning process comes later. Celestalon 

Is Water Jets inteded usage for PvE when the nova can't trigger FoF on Bosses?
Yes. Celestalon 

brain freeze going to be hitting harder relevant to other mage spells to make up for added cast time?
Yes. Celestalon 

Very happy to see deepfreeze gone from fire, but I won't be able to have knockback blastwave+ living bomb? :/
Correct. One or the other. Celestalon 
Will there be a knockback version of blastwave? Liked it much better than the daze effect one.
Supernova does a knock up, but no knockback. Celestalon 

I never liked running and casting, but yeah it's only the filler. What about scorch? Won't be useable on the move right?
Scorch will. Mages are fairly light on ability to cast while moving well, Fire/Arcane anyway. Scorch's damage is low. Celestalon 

Are Dragon's Breath/Cone of Cold going to be AoE DPS increases in Warlords? Or just utility spells?
Yes, significant DPS value. Celestalon 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Question about Mistweaver monks: How high is the DPS going to be in another stance? Can I fulfill DD role in raid permanently?
Exact numbers TBD, but no - someone equal to a pure DPS who could stance swap to be a full healer would be too good. WatcherDev 

If you keep that up people can't do anything when taking damage and can do it all when taking little. No counterplay.
We did add countering gameplay to Fists of Fury. If you break the stun, it will not restun you. Celestalon 

Brewmaster monks have found a niche in raiding as the "high dps tanks". Will we still bring that utility in WoD?
They had that niche briefly, especially around 5.2, but that hasn't really been the case since then. All tank dmg will be equal. Celestalon 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Prot paladin losing Aven Wrath - does this also mean no more wings? As its symbolic of the paladin in my view
We hear ya on the feedback about the Wings visual. Celestalon 

Please don't forget the rets, taking 30% of your damage and GoAKis going to ruining our dps that is not already so good
Rest easy, we haven't done a damage tuning pass yet. Those are design changes, not balance changes. Celestalon 

Empowered Seals paladin talent. Seal juggling viable again? And can we get more than one buff from this active at same time?
Yes. That is explicitly a talent to opt into seal twisting. Celestalon 
I thought it was still just called stance dancing
"Dancing" refers to swapping states to use an ability you can only use in that state. "Twisting" refers to mixing states... Celestalon 
... back and forth, frequently, in order to gain the benefit of both. #gaminglingo Celestalon 

Crit/multistrike still useless for Prot Paladins in terms of mitigation? and any changes to Holy Wrath?
No, not useless. Very useful. Stay tuned for next patch notes update. Still considering Holy Wrath changes. Celestalon 
will this include ret stuff?!? Seems very light. Changes to talents? Less cd dependent? Glyphs? Divine storm in ST?
Ret's in a fairly good place right now, design-wise. We think simple number tuning can solve their problems hasn't happened yet Celestalon 
Removing Inquisition negates a lot of our Holy Damage unless compensated elsewhere. Tuning needs to be done soon.
Relax. We will do a damage tuning pass. The sky is not falling. Removing Inquisition is done as a design change, not balance change Celestalon 

Would I be right in assuming that seraphim is designed to be a "mini burst" cd? Playing into the CD orientated ret gameplay?...
Yes. It's a small frequent CD, that also makes your other CDs more frequent. Celestalon 
other CDs more frequent? How so? Didn't read that anywhere
With Seraphim, you should typically hit your other cooldowns while Seraphim is active and so you have more Readiness. Celestalon 
readiness reduces my cooldown on my major burst CDs???
That's... exactly what Readiness does, yes. Celestalon 
oh wow! Ok, well if it's going to be temp, how will that effect calculations of CD timers? Seems complicated
While Seraphim is up, your CDs are shorter; ideal to hit them then. Celestalon 
when seraphim goes off, the CD goes back up again? What happens if the CD was only 10 secs away with sera, then falls?
At the time that you use a CD, its remaining cooldown is locked it; it doesn't change further. It's pretty intuitive. Celestalon 

A Paladin without Holy Light is no longer a Warcraft Paladin. Uther did not heal people with "Word Of Glory".
We removed the "cheap, weak heal" -- names will be reassigned to keep the most iconic ones. I agree with you. WatcherDev 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Clarity of power will make both Solace and insanity and Divine insight completely useless for singlet target fight. Thoughts?
It definitely will not affect Solace and Insanity. Divine Insight is being changed to proc from something else instead. Celestalon 
Sorry, meant for From Darkness, comes light instead of Solace and Insanity. Is this one also getting changed?
Yes. Don't recall the exact change. Celestalon 

is it worth to use holy word:sanctuary in wod? It is almost useless without 4 piece bonus.
Yes. It was massively buffed. Celestalon 

SW: D removed from disc/holy? Skill-cap of priests reduced by a LARGE amount. This makes no sense
There's a glyph to get back the gameplay you're talking about for Holy/Disc. Celestalon 

with aoe capping for lvl 90 priest talents, what they place in rotation? It will cost much, with not so big heals.
They're still high priority, rotationally. Celestalon 

And is that new mastery for Shadow supposed to be the big 'wow, damage!' factor from losing all this utility? No mana hymn?
We cut a ton of abilities from all classes, not just Shadow. Shadow's new Mastery is immensely powerful in choosing ST vs AoE. Celestalon 
Have to say, I was looking forward to a ST *talent*, but having to choose AE/ST in gearing DO NOT WANT
Curious, why? Celestalon 
Didn't see Mind Sear on that list. Still, would be better through a talent rather than gear. Gear locks you in. Talent doesnt
Gear most certainly does *not* lock you in. Celestalon 

Hello, why was Shadow Word: Death removed from healing priests? It's a skillful mechanic in PvP
That mechanic is still there via Glyph of Holy Fire, which gives Holy Fire the self-damage skillshot for Holy/Disc in PvP. Celestalon 
wow... That's not in the patch notes yet I guess or I might be blind. Thanks.
Nope, we don't have a full list of new/removed glyphs in the patch notes yet. Celestalon 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Is there a chance that Enhanced Premeditation will be scrapped? Being able to control Premeditation is fairly important...
We realize that it has some downside to it, but believe that the power of Enhanced Premeditation, combined with CP being... Celestalon 
...on the rogue, instead of target specific, make it a significant net gain. Celestalon 

With backstab not getting changed will hemo be more like cata? Diff in mop hemo & stab 64% cata 16%...
Not sure what you're asking... Celestalon 
when you are forced to use hemo the difference in mop from backstab is massive in cata is was a small loss.
Somewhere in between. Celestalon 
Could we at least get an explanation on why backstab is now the only positional move in the game? Pls don't say its the name
Because it's a small DPS difference that you can opt into. Fits Subtlety's theme. Shouldn't be usable on something attacking you. Celestalon 
Shred mangle had this same difference you could opt into and yet. I was really looking forward to sub not being held back..
That wasn't something you could opt into or out of. Backstab is not something that will 'hold back' Subtlety. Celestalon 
So in PvP, is it now possible to be able to Backstab somebody and be dodged or parried?
Not if you stay behind the target, as you have been. Celestalon 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Ele takes huge hit to single target with no compensation?Also, no one will use EQ even with the buff.Maybe if it's instant cast.
Don't look for 'compensation' like that; we haven't done a damage tuning pass yet. Celestalon 
And I think you may have missed the Draenor Perk that affects Earthquake. It's gigantic. Celestalon 

Another clarifying question: Shocking Lava, is that on casts or hits ie: will LvB overloads add a charge?
Cast. Overloads don't generate additional charges. Celestalon 

Mobile LB must stay for Ele. Can't use ES while moving since we need to build stacks. Unleash's damage is bad / being removed.
Actually, you can use Earth Shock for movement; it's good for that, no loss of Fulmination DPS. And perhaps you misread... Celestalon 
...the Unleash Elements changes? It's better than before, still very valuable while moving. Celestalon 

Ascendance is too good to not use Spiritwalker's with, too. Options would be nice! Maybe revise the lvl45 tier?
You only say that because you're used to Ascendance being the only time SwG has much value to you. You won't pair them in Warlords. Celestalon 

any chance we could get a minor glyph that makes Lighting Bolt look like b4? When it was actually a bolt... Thx!
Technically it was really more of a ball.... Always looking for cool cosmetic glyphs, though. WatcherDev 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Of all the "button Bloat" for locks why not get rid of unending breath?
It's a possibility, but our concern was more with combat abilities. Is Unending Breath something you give a prominent keybind? WatcherDev 

Any reason of Soulshatter removal? Just ability bloat?
Largely. It's mostly seen as a relic from days when DPS needed active threat management tools Feint, Cower, etc.. WatcherDev 

Worried Affliction rot will be simple: Keep dots/haunt up spam Mal grasp all fight?
Then you'd be missing out on timing Haunt well. Celestalon 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Thanks for the answer! Also, could you confirm that current goal for Gladiator instance is making prot a viable DPS spec?
Confirmed, but you will NOT be able to viably tank in Gladiator Stance. Really. Celestalon 

removing berseker stance was something I never thought I was gonna see. We're the stances so hard to balance for WoD? pvp
.It isn't a question of balance but rather finding an interesting niche for both DPS stances. holinka 

How will Resolve help warrior tanks with their limited self heals and absorbs?
The same way Vengeance helps them now -- it lets Shield Barrier scale with incoming damage Shield Block naturally does. WatcherDev
