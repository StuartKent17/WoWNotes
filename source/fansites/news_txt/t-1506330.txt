Warlords of Draenor - Draenei Guard Armor Set
It seems that players may not be able to get this set, as it appears to be intended for NPCs.

Blue Tweets
Racials
Noticing undead racials only ones useless to healers, any plans to change that? Touch of grave restore mana on heal cast etc?
Yeah, Undead for Healers is on our list to look at. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452035468159250433

do races still have bonuses to professions or has that been removed?
They still have them. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452133965218848768

What's the logic behind making Arcane Torrent give pally's 1 HP, but priests & monks 3% mana?
It's 1 Chi for Monks, and Priests have no secondary resource. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452180114642452481

Classes
with all this changes its safe to say that encounters will be tunned for low burst/low inevitable damage?
LowER damage, yes. We'll tune around healers' potential. There's still room for scary burst moments, with time to recover after. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452115423178153984

Sorry if you answered, but what is the reason for less crit on int users, but more on agi?
Fits their theme better, and is consistent with how they have been for 9+ years. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452147125434851328

Bigger change: Active mitigation for tanks in Cata/MoP, or coming healer changes in WoD?
Active Mitigation for tanks. That fundamentally changed how you tank; healing changes are more about pace. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452179800539418624

small question , if I may - on Garrosh kills, often tank contributes a /huge/ amnt of dmg, certainly in phase one.. how 1/2
Tank damage will still be significant, as described in the paragraph above Resolve. We're increasing their base damage. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452186308799000577

Will repeated Rune Taps and Strike increase the size of the Rune Shield like Blood Shield currently?
Yes, successive Rune Strikes and Rune Taps add to the size of a Rune Shield. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452135816341385216

More! Frost DK, Perks improve Razorice/Cinderglacier, 2h currently uses neither favoring Fallen Crusader. Changing that?
Yeah, we're going to try mixing up which runeforges Frost uses. Realize that that's a big change, and what you see isn't enough. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452148212552306688
Interesting. Going to be a playstyle thing, or more "x rune required for x type of fight"?
Current plan is Cinderglacier for 2H, Cinderglacier+Razorice for DW. Definitely not set in stone. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452148689352417280

Blood DK 3 shields? Blood Shield, Rune Shield & Rune Tap shield?
Rune Shield is one shield shared by Rune Tap huge and Rune Strike tiny. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452021320008470528
Rune Strike just provides a more frequent, steady stream of little shields. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452021427219091456
I personally was a huge fan of the reactive active mitigation that DKs had
It's still there. It's done transparently through Resolve, instead of being an opaque mechanic specific to DStrike Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452136105291173889

Will ravage feral still need facing requirement? Nice change for ambush, backstab, and shred BTW.
I believe it is the same for ravage. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/452144744294928384
Yes, same for Ravage. I'll get that added to the notes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452144841170751488

Any chance of survival becoming a multi-dot spec?
You can apply Serpent Sting on multiple mobs, so it is in a way. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452022001037635585

Disarm Trap. Just the spell is being removed? Or the entire ability to disarm traps e.g., by right-clicking on them?
Disarm Trap completely removed. Detect Trap is staying for now. Reasoning is because of the PvP disarmament. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452178748058525696

skimmed hunter sections of notes, can't help but feel gutted. Lots of utility gone; just another dps in the crowd.
You are the only ranged DPS class who can do everything on the move, for starters. What are the main abilities you'll miss? WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/451936974140493825
Scatter S & Distracting S are big, Widow Venom less so. Silence S gone include Counter S? HMark nice flavor but not critical.
What is the everyday use of Distracting Shot that you're going to miss most? WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452107024076009472

Distracting shot is the only thing I'll miss... so nice on Heroic LK 25 solo to get the adds on me so I won't be dropped off 
That's something we can and will fix on the encounter logic side. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452106214453682177

Scatter S & Distracting S are big, Widow Venom less so. Silence S gone include Counter S? HMark nice flavor but not critical.
No, you keep Counter Shot. Scatter/Silence were removed as part of overall CC disarmament. Nearly everyone lost something. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452106839006535683

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage / Skills http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage / WoD Talent Calculator http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g
Will the new Mirror Images mimic mage's spell casting or just cast filter spells? If mimic, big DPS CD; if not, very weak.
It's a big DPS CD. They cast spec-appropriate spells, and hit hard. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452029335000453120
So they have a set rotation but won't mimic your own spell casting?
Correct. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452030044378902528

Flameglow also feels like something we'd never use, not sure if you have any plans to modify it, or just leave it as is.
Flameglow shines in the case where you're taking frequent little hits of damage. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452212087779885056

PoM... what will we use it with? AB? Maybe we could make it give us some kind of buff, or do something different?
Mostly Arcane Blast. Occasionally a couple other things. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452211986076430336
You didn't consider changing it, or just cutting it? High-haste AB... it'll be useless, not sure why we're keeping it.
It's definitely not useless... Faster, and usable while moving. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452214371968487424

Sad that evo is arcane-only now. I liked the glyph as fire.
Glyph boils down to a cooldown-heal, which is cool and I liked too. Doesn't necessarily need to be tied to evoc. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/451911723327299585
How do fire/frost regen mana?
Do you find yourself low on mana at any point nowadays? Making mana more interesting would be great, big change tho Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/452132573712355329
I like the evo-heal as a PvP mage, too. But hey I'll get over it 
We turned the Glyph of Evocation heal into Glyph of Ice Block, which attaches that same heal to Ice Block. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452134120533942272
Is that Ice Block heal an HOT cancel Ice Block early, no full heal, or instant?
Same HoT as Glyph of Evo had. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452142047533621248
any way to counter that? At least on live, we can kick/cc the evo. Maybe allow MD to remove block and heal?
Mass Dispel does break Ice Block in 6.0. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452186836740227072

Do Frost bomb pulses triggered by Ice Lance still snare targets?
No. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452180741858656256

really hoping for some clarification on what brain freeze is getting turned into
Still going to make it treat the target as frozen, and increase damage. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452183997053808640

Incanter's Flow is: 5-10-15-20-25-20-15-10-5 and back up, or does it go down to 0?
5-10-15-20-25-25-20-15-10-5-repeat. Yes, that may be OP compared to Rune at current tuning. Tuning process comes later. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452184540966973440

Is Water Jets inteded usage for PvE when the nova can't trigger FoF on Bosses?
Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452146885768146944

brain freeze going to be hitting harder relevant to other mage spells to make up for added cast time?
Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452152636163117056

Very happy to see deepfreeze gone from fire, but I won't be able to have knockback blastwave+ living bomb? :/
Correct. One or the other. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452030828856348674
Will there be a knockback version of blastwave? Liked it much better than the daze effect one.
Supernova does a knock up, but no knockback. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452031386874937344

I never liked running and casting, but yeah it's only the filler. What about scorch? Won't be useable on the move right?
Scorch will. Mages are fairly light on ability to cast while moving well, Fire/Arcane anyway. Scorch's damage is low. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452037580217778176

Are Dragon's Breath/Cone of Cold going to be AoE DPS increases in Warlords? Or just utility spells?
Yes, significant DPS value. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452155638781456384

Question about Mistweaver monks: How high is the DPS going to be in another stance? Can I fulfill DD role in raid permanently?
Exact numbers TBD, but no - someone equal to a pure DPS who could stance swap to be a full healer would be too good. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452116529677488128

If you keep that up people can't do anything when taking damage and can do it all when taking little. No counterplay.
We did add countering gameplay to Fists of Fury. If you break the stun, it will not restun you. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452175773034508288

Brewmaster monks have found a niche in raiding as the "high dps tanks". Will we still bring that utility in WoD?
They had that niche briefly, especially around 5.2, but that hasn't really been the case since then. All tank dmg will be equal. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452194001362227200

Prot paladin losing Aven Wrath - does this also mean no more wings? As its symbolic of the paladin in my view
We hear ya on the feedback about the Wings visual. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452031942750253056

Please don't forget the rets, taking 30% of your damage and GoAKis going to ruining our dps that is not already so good
Rest easy, we haven't done a damage tuning pass yet. Those are design changes, not balance changes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452153127131557888

Empowered Seals paladin talent. Seal juggling viable again? And can we get more than one buff from this active at same time?
Yes. That is explicitly a talent to opt into seal twisting. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452161125535076352
I thought it was still just called stance dancing
"Dancing" refers to swapping states to use an ability you can only use in that state. "Twisting" refers to mixing states... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452173153209290752
... back and forth, frequently, in order to gain the benefit of both. #gaminglingo Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452173272784715776

Crit/multistrike still useless for Prot Paladins in terms of mitigation? and any changes to Holy Wrath?
No, not useless. Very useful. Stay tuned for next patch notes update. Still considering Holy Wrath changes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452028773630611456
will this include ret stuff?!? Seems very light. Changes to talents? Less cd dependent? Glyphs? Divine storm in ST?
Ret's in a fairly good place right now, design-wise. We think simple number tuning can solve their problems hasn't happened yet Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452030586874363904
Removing Inquisition negates a lot of our Holy Damage unless compensated elsewhere. Tuning needs to be done soon.
Relax. We will do a damage tuning pass. The sky is not falling. Removing Inquisition is done as a design change, not balance change Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452033022653513728

Would I be right in assuming that seraphim is designed to be a "mini burst" cd? Playing into the CD orientated ret gameplay?...
Yes. It's a small frequent CD, that also makes your other CDs more frequent. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452035327859761153
other CDs more frequent? How so? Didn't read that anywhere
With Seraphim, you should typically hit your other cooldowns while Seraphim is active and so you have more Readiness. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452035978069155840
readiness reduces my cooldown on my major burst CDs???
That's... exactly what Readiness does, yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452036512889073664
oh wow! Ok, well if it's going to be temp, how will that effect calculations of CD timers? Seems complicated
While Seraphim is up, your CDs are shorter; ideal to hit them then. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452036981279555584
when seraphim goes off, the CD goes back up again? What happens if the CD was only 10 secs away with sera, then falls?
At the time that you use a CD, its remaining cooldown is locked it; it doesn't change further. It's pretty intuitive. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452037818081370112

A Paladin without Holy Light is no longer a Warcraft Paladin. Uther did not heal people with "Word Of Glory".
We removed the "cheap, weak heal" -- names will be reassigned to keep the most iconic ones. I agree with you. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452104939007774721

Clarity of power will make both Solace and insanity and Divine insight completely useless for singlet target fight. Thoughts?
It definitely will not affect Solace and Insanity. Divine Insight is being changed to proc from something else instead. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452024424565194752
Sorry, meant for From Darkness, comes light instead of Solace and Insanity. Is this one also getting changed?
Yes. Don't recall the exact change. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452024903730876416

is it worth to use holy word:sanctuary in wod? It is almost useless without 4 piece bonus.
Yes. It was massively buffed. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452025896983998464

SW: D removed from disc/holy? Skill-cap of priests reduced by a LARGE amount. This makes no sense
There's a glyph to get back the gameplay you're talking about for Holy/Disc. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452027069543628800

with aoe capping for lvl 90 priest talents, what they place in rotation? It will cost much, with not so big heals.
They're still high priority, rotationally. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452030131674939392

And is that new mastery for Shadow supposed to be the big 'wow, damage!' factor from losing all this utility? No mana hymn?
We cut a ton of abilities from all classes, not just Shadow. Shadow's new Mastery is immensely powerful in choosing ST vs AoE. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451895217763799040
Have to say, I was looking forward to a ST *talent*, but having to choose AE/ST in gearing DO NOT WANT
Curious, why? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452019128476241920
Didn't see Mind Sear on that list. Still, would be better through a talent rather than gear. Gear locks you in. Talent doesnt
Gear most certainly does *not* lock you in. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452033649303498752

Hello, why was Shadow Word: Death removed from healing priests? It's a skillful mechanic in PvP
That mechanic is still there via Glyph of Holy Fire, which gives Holy Fire the self-damage skillshot for Holy/Disc in PvP. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452141613498650624
wow... That's not in the patch notes yet I guess or I might be blind. Thanks.
Nope, we don't have a full list of new/removed glyphs in the patch notes yet. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452143727369138176

when you are forced to use hemo the difference in mop from backstab is massive in cata is was a small loss.
Somewhere in between. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452145141759754240
Could we at least get an explanation on why backstab is now the only positional move in the game? Pls don't say its the name
Because it's a small DPS difference that you can opt into. Fits Subtlety's theme. Shouldn't be usable on something attacking you. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452146828436193280
Shred mangle had this same difference you could opt into and yet. I was really looking forward to sub not being held back..
That wasn't something you could opt into or out of. Backstab is not something that will 'hold back' Subtlety. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452150468366438400
So in PvP, is it now possible to be able to Backstab somebody and be dodged or parried?
Not if you stay behind the target, as you have been. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452176435801628672

Ele takes huge hit to single target with no compensation?Also, no one will use EQ even with the buff.Maybe if it's instant cast.
Don't look for 'compensation' like that; we haven't done a damage tuning pass yet. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452030999409348608
And I think you may have missed the Draenor Perk that affects Earthquake. It's gigantic. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452031081995190273

Another clarifying question: Shocking Lava, is that on casts or hits ie: will LvB overloads add a charge?
Cast. Overloads don't generate additional charges. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452185416565669888

Mobile LB must stay for Ele. Can't use ES while moving since we need to build stacks. Unleash's damage is bad / being removed.
Actually, you can use Earth Shock for movement; it's good for that, no loss of Fulmination DPS. And perhaps you misread... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452141889383178240
...the Unleash Elements changes? It's better than before, still very valuable while moving. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452141973499940864

Ascendance is too good to not use Spiritwalker's with, too. Options would be nice! Maybe revise the lvl45 tier?
You only say that because you're used to Ascendance being the only time SwG has much value to you. You won't pair them in Warlords. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452143932248297472

any chance we could get a minor glyph that makes Lighting Bolt look like b4? When it was actually a bolt... Thx!
Technically it was really more of a ball.... Always looking for cool cosmetic glyphs, though. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452115143489359872

Of all the "button Bloat" for locks why not get rid of unending breath?
It's a possibility, but our concern was more with combat abilities. Is Unending Breath something you give a prominent keybind? WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452130715816050688

Any reason of Soulshatter removal? Just ability bloat?
Largely. It's mostly seen as a relic from days when DPS needed active threat management tools Feint, Cower, etc.. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452195013099667456

Worried Affliction rot will be simple: Keep dots/haunt up spam Mal grasp all fight?
Then you'd be missing out on timing Haunt well. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452147667565424640

Thanks for the answer! Also, could you confirm that current goal for Gladiator instance is making prot a viable DPS spec?
Confirmed, but you will NOT be able to viably tank in Gladiator Stance. Really. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452030291754758144

removing berseker stance was something I never thought I was gonna see. We're the stances so hard to balance for WoD? pvp
.It isn't a question of balance but rather finding an interesting niche for both DPS stances. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/452144604217737216

How will Resolve help warrior tanks with their limited self heals and absorbs?
The same way Vengeance helps them now -- it lets Shield Barrier scale with incoming damage Shield Block naturally does. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452175733180227584
