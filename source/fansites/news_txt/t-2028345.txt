Preview: Wardrobe Updates
The World of Warcraft: Legion pre-expansion patch is coming soon, and that means a great number of changes and improvements to the game are on their way. We’ve recently outlined several reasons to get ready for it all here and here.

Today, we’re opening up the walk-in closet of wardrobe updates and looking around at what’s in store for your character’s looks.

Bound to Look Good
With the Legion pre-expansion patch, every piece of gear that is bound to your character permanently unlocks that item’s appearance for you. Even if you sell or destroy the item, you’ll always be able to look through the new Appearances tab in the Collections window to find its look.


  

There are several ways to look through all of the Appearances—take note of the icons across the top of the window, and select any of them to narrow the displayed looks. As you page through the looks you’ve unlocked, you’ll also see looks that you haven’t unlocked yet with a grey frame around them. Right-click on any look that you have unlocked to set it as a favorite, which promotes it to the first page of your collection.

Above the item-type icons, there’s a handy search field.


  

Type anything you like in the search field to filter the items displayed even further.

Trying Things On
To put change how you look, you’ll need to visit a Transmogrification vendor. You’ll notice that the Transmogrification vendor’s interface has been completely updated with a new look and new features.


  

Now, when you select a gear slot, you’ll see a preview of all of the different looking gear that your character can apply to the look of that slot. Go through as many as you like, then select ‘Apply’, and you’re done. You can save different looks as ‘Outfits’, so you can return later and change into a different Outfit anytime. Save a different Outfit for each of your different specializations, and when you change specs, your Outfit will automatically change, too!

A Beautifully Big Adventure
Now that you know how you want to look, don’t forget that the Adventure Journal is there for you. The Loot tab in the Adventure Journal is the place to look for full sets of gear, or amazing Legendary items, and where to find them.


  

Don’t overlook the buttons on the top right of the Loot tab. You can click on them and then drop down to filter the item sets by specialization, and the Legendary items by class, specialization, and slot. Hold down the control key and click on each of the parts of an item set to open a Dressing Room window and see how you’ll look once you’ve collected that set.

As you mouseover each item, a message at the bottom of that item’s tooltip will tell you whether you’ve collected it yet. From anywhere in the Adventure Guide, you can type the name of a piece of gear into the search bar, and you’ll be taken right to the page of the guide for the Dungeon and Boss that drops that item.


  

It feels good to look good.


PTR Character Copy Disabled
Towards the end of testing in a milestone we begin to flag builds as 'Release' versions, so we can test a game client that more closely matches the behavior of the live retail version of the game. Release versions don't change much in terms of content for public testers, however certain test features will be disabled, in this case: in-game Character Copy functionality.

Character Copy was disabled in the build we released earlier this week and will likely remain disabled for the remainder of 7.0.3 PTR testing. Existing characters will not be affected and Character Copy will return after at a later date.

I would also like to thank everyone who helped us test 7.0.3 on the PTR. Your continued feedback and reports help make World of Warcraft a fun and rewarding experience for all!


Beta Launch Test July 15 4:30 p.m. PDT
Today, July 15, we’re going to test launching Legion with the Legion Beta, and we’d appreciate your help.

At about 4:00 p.m. PDT, we’ll take the Beta down for a few minutes to prepare. Then, at 4:30 p.m. PDT, we’ll bring the Beta up for testers to log in. Players will need to login with a new character using the ‘Legion Launch Test’ template that will be available. During this time, any characters they above level 100 won’t be accessible. Once enough players have logged in, we will begin broadcasting server messages to indicate that Legion is about to go “live”.

As the expansion “launches”, you will be automatically prompted with new quests to start your adventures in Legion. Please follow them through to conclusion, and play through your class Order Hall opening quests. This will give us a useful look at our live launch.

We need your help identifying issues, and we’ll be looking for your feedback on the test launch in this thread and via in-game bug reports.

Thank you very much!

Game Balance and Communication
So, apparently there is a lot of behind the scene tuning and changes happening. Thats great!

But some of us would like to know what is happening, when it happens. We don't see template changes, we don't see ability changes.

Things like the interrupt reduction for shadow and shaman are invisible and unkown to any player that hasn't read the forum post back in alpha and probably wonders why interrupts last shorter on these specs. And this is just an example. There is no UI element or passive buff or anything. It is invisible.

I know this is still beta but are there any plans to make these things more visible?
I'm preparing a very large post for these forums on this issue. Stay tuned. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Stealth Breaking
We've added a combat log line when Stealth breaks, and it should show what spell or ability caused Stealth to be removed. If you run into abilities that you feel shouldn't break Stealth and do, please create a bug report with the ability.

This is considered an 'Aura Dispel' in the combat log filter settings, so the easiest way to look for these is to create a new filter, and only have 'Done To: Me', and 'Aura' 'Dispels' selected.

Will Demon Invasions continue to happen after launch instead of stopping on 30/8? There's a reward only pre-order can get if not.
you don't have to pre order to play invasions, anyone can! Muffinus
