This morning, someone sent me a video from Pacifism http://www.pacifismguild.com. The guy who mailed it didn't seem to be from the guild so I asked their officers if I could post it and .... They accepted. They of course didn't kill him but it show the first two phases of the fight, which is always better than a few screenshots. Thanks again to Pacifism http://www.pacifismguild.com for allowing us to reupload it on google vid and post it, it was one on their first try and it was 2:00 AM, and actually the attempt look nice. The video is from live servers

Kael'thas
For The Horde http://www.for-the-horde.de could experience more tries on Kael'thas tonight with the help of a GM on the PTR.
They reached the final phase of the fight and we've got a few screenshots ... But they also frapsed it, which means that a movie is on the way.
