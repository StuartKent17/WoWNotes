Frightened Kodo Mount Guide
Most of the 8.1 Darkshore rare mounts drop from specific rare mobs around the map much like the Arathi rare mounts. However, the Frightened Kodo  is acquired a little differently. Here is what we have learned about obtaining this mount:


   




Frightened Kodo  is a rare spawn on a timer reportedly anywhere from 2-6 hours
It is a friendly NPC that must be clicked. You will receive the message "Frightened Kodo nuzzles your hand. He wants to come with you!" and the mount will be placed into your bags several seconds later.
Only the first person who clicks the spawned mob will receive the mount. It despawns shortly after being clicked or if no one clicks it within about 2 minutes.
It has 6 known spawn locations, all of which are marked on the map above. You can find a waypoint macro on the Warcraft Secrets website 

41.3 65.5
44.0 67.5
41.3 54.0
38.0 66.0
39.2 56.5
44.0 65.0

Server resets seem to be a good time to check for a spawn.
It is lootable by class trials and level 110's on both factions.
It does not matter which faction controls Darkshore for it to spawn or be obtainable.

Feedback: Island Expeditions
There were a number of changes to Island Expeditions in the Tides of Vengeance content update. Now that they have been live for several weeks, we wanted to take a moment and get your thoughts on them. It can be about anything you have experienced but here are some questions to open things up: How have the changes felt? Have things improved? Has anything gotten worse? What rewards have you been getting?
If you haven’t tried Islands out at all since the latest content update, before commenting please go ahead and try out a few and let us know what you experienced. Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts and Happy New Year! Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Holy Paladin Gameplay
Cleave healing. A lot of people still think we’re “tank healers” but we actually aren’t. At least not directly. If you directly heal the tanks you’re going to lose a lot of healing. This is due to how beacons work. Our niche is cleave healing and triage healing. We always heal 3 targets for the price of 1 with beacons and even up to 7 targets with LoD if you don’t directly hit your beacons. This helps smooth out tank damage quite a bit while allowing you to heal other people rather than focus solely on the tanks. The only time you’d directly heal tanks is if they’re getting destroyed and they really need extra focus but tank healing is better done from a mistweaver now. Our cleave healing is fairly good
A huge misconception is that pallies are "just" tank healers. I was still going of this old mentality for awhile as well but now more than ever our niche is pretty well defined in a raid. If you’re doing it right we’re keeping tanks stable and spot healing the rest of the raid allowing us to pick up spots where AoE healing isn’t cutting it from the rest of the classes.

Heart of Azeroth necklace not account wide?
What weekly reduction? Oh that thing you paused a while back to increase time played metrics so people have to regrind stuff they already had when the raid launches.
Ion already spoke at length about this in the last Q&A but we admit it doesn’t feel good. The lack of reduction really only negatively affects very high end players pushing for absurdly high Azerite levels, we’re talking 40-44 looking at you Myppoo you insane person you. For anything under that the levels are still within reasonable amounts to gain another level, plus 37-38 is all that you need to get ring 3 on even Mythic Dazar’alor gear.

We know it doesn’t feel good to put in more work to unlock the exact same traits you just had, and we said in the last Q&A that we’re working on that. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
