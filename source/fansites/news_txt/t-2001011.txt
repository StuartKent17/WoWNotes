Vanilla Dungeon Objective XP Nerf
What Id love to know is why this was done so stealthily.
I have no issues with 1-40 being harder, but why nerf BC and Wrath dungeon xp?
What's the basis for this claim? We didn't touch BC or Wrath dungeon experience. 

One additional bullet point that should have been in yesterday's hotfix notes is that we did reduce the experience from the dungeon "scenario" objectives for Classic dungeons levels 15-58. Those awards were new as of Warlords, but for low-level dungeons they were largely were redundant with the numerous quests available inside each dungeon. Dungeons are intended to be rewarding, and they still are, but zoning into Deadmines and completing ~5 quests, plus the kill experience for everything, plus a couple more quests' worth of experience from the dungeon objectives, was overkill. When we looked at low-level dungeons and tried to understand what had changed to make them so much more lucrative over time, that bonus objective experience immediately stood out. 

There wasn't any intent to hide this change it's not a subtle change, and obviously it was immediately noticed. There were a total of 8 different hotfixes rolled out over the past week or two as part of this entire plan, and that one just slipped through the cracks when we were writing up the documentation of the changes.

PvP Gear Item Levels
Hey guys! Just want to correct the basis for this discussion.

Currently, what's going on with the ilvl for gear from rated PvP in Legion is: it's decided dynamically when it's rewarded to you, and that decision is based on your rating.

So while the lowest version of an item may be 870, it will have its ilvl increased to 880, 890, or 900 -- based on your rating. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Discipline Priest -- Legion Beta Feedback
Thanks for all the feedback. To revisit something that we touched on back at Blizzcon, but perhaps haven't talked about since then: Discipline is the most complex healer to play in 7.0 by a wide margin, and is possibly the most advanced core rotation of any spec. We know this and are generally okay with it, even though we still want to manage it within reason. It is to some extent inevitable due to the mixture of DPS- and heal-type targeting that Disc has to frequently swap between, something that no other spec asks of you outside of specific talents. Also, Disc is intentionally positioned against Holy, which is one of the more accessible healers in 7.0.

Feedback from all players is still very useful for looking at potential skill-floor issues, but 7.0 Discipline is intended to be something you opt into if you are seeking out the mixed DPS/heal gameplay that it's built around. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

What happened to the awesome class titles like Highlord that you got from completing the artifact quest in alpha?
Felt premature to award titles like those so quickly. They are now earned by completing your Class Order campaign. WarcraftDevs 

The drop rate on the archi mount is being reduced on the pre xpac patch ?
No - Mythic Archimonde and Blackhand’s mounts will become rare drops when Legion launches. WarcraftDevs
