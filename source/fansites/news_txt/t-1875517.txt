Fan Art - Everybody wants to Rule the World of Warcraft
Someone put together a nice combination of the World of Warcaft cinematics with the Lorde version of "Everybody Wants To Rule The World https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y-pE6MyTJo".

Blue Posts
Lack of CM Communication
What's wrong to post more information about the game, and be more open? I see there are many Blue post welcoming their new colleague... but none of them are talking and interacting with us.
It's worth keeping in mind that the forum is just one part of our responsibilities as CMs. This article http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/b20/interviews.html#thirdInterview click on Community Manager / Editor gives a good insight into our day to day.

In the interests of transparency I’d also like to briefly run through some of the other things we do, besides the forums. This will hopefully give you an idea of our rather varied workload:


Creating/Localising/Publishing of content Blogs, social media, etc. Reviewing and forwarding feedback from forums, social media, e-mails, fan sites, etc. Interaction with players through digital platforms as well as in person at events – Hellfest for example Contests and Giveaways Planning and execution of events Launch events, GamesCom, Road to BlizzCon, etc. Supporting fan sites, bloggers, streamers, YouTubers, competition and event organisers Fireside Gatherings, BarCrafts, etc., pro gamers, cosplayers and other artists – basically all the people who are active in the community. 


As you can see, it’s a very varied list of tasks but all of the tasks directly relate to the community as a whole. There’s never really a shortage of work that needs doing.

Although we are reading the forums every day to stay informed about trends, suggestions and feedback, please also keep in mind that the forums are primarily intended as a way for everyone to discuss the game amongst themselves. 

Now that being said, I do intend to interact with you as frequently as I can. If you have any questions after reading this, please don't hesitate to ask.

Blue Tweets
content designers create quests, partially? noticed an opening for an associate is why I'm curious. I'd guess darkmoon too?
Spawning, quests, encounters, events holidays and otherwise. Yeah, that general range of things. craig_amai https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/649474148746461184

Normal Hellfire Citadel hotfixes
itch if it doesnt stay easy and then progression is ruined for those that dont want a blow through on normal
The thing is, these changes won't make the actual intended audience "blow through" normal. If you crush Normal, do Heroic. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/649633451193184256
