MMO-Champion survived the migration to vBulletin and the site is now live. Obviously, there is still a lot of work to do on the website and you can expect a lot of changes in the next few days. <br>
<br>
Important stuff<br>
<br>
Most of the old news posts are still in the old News Forum (http://mmoc.aghq.net/forums/252-News), they will be moved to the front page shortly. (Today or Tomorrow)<br>
Most of the layout bugs are already known, don&apos;t bother reporting them. <br>
If you find any super-important bug, please post them on the Suggestions and Feedback Forum (http://mmoc.aghq.net/forums/253-Suggestions-and-Feedback)<br>
