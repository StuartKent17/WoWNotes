Siege of Orgrimmar - Garrosh Defeat: Horde Cinematic 
Spoilers ahead! This version is very similar to the Alliance version, but shows the conversation that was taking place across the room that you can't hear in the Alliance version. Congratulations to Apophasis http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/shattered-hand/Apophasis for getting the second kill, and the first Horde kill!
