We didn't particularly want a lot of these items in circulation, so that's partially intended. We really do want to keep legendary weapons legendary, and Dragonwrath ended up being more readily available than we were comfortable with.

Nonetheless, we should have recognized that the completion rate was faster than we wanted, and taken action, sooner. 


Legendary Staff - Smoldering Essence Droprate Stealth Nerf Confirmed
One of the many stealth nerf deployed yesterday on live realms was a nerf of the questline to obtain Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71086/dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest/, but not in a good way.

The droprate of Smoldering Essences required for the Heart of the Flame http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29307/heart-of-flame/ quest has been considerably lowered, you will now get about 50% less essences than before the nerf.


For example, you will now get 9 or 10 essences from bosses in 25-Man Heroic mode instead of 17-19. 
Players in 10-Man Heroic mode will only get 3 or 4 instead of an average of 7. 


This change is surprising and might not be a good news for players, if Blizzard suddenly wants some parts of the game to last longer before the next patch. 

Just like any of yesterday's nerf to the firelands raid bosses, we don't have any comment or information from Blizzard at this point and the only comment is from a Blizzard QA poster who confirmed that this is indeed an intentional change.
This was an intentional change, not a bug.
