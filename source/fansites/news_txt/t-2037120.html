Unable to See Friends in Your Party In-Game<br>
We are currently investigating an issue where players in your party or raid may not be visible in-game due to being out of phase or on another realm. Our development team is currently working on a resolution and we&apos;ll be using this forum sticky to provide updates. <br>
<br>
<br>
Preview - Professions in Legion<br>
In World of Warcraft: Legion, a number of updates and improvements to Professions are on their way. Today, we&#x2019;re taking a look at the new ways you&#x2019;ll work with the resources of Azeroth&#x2014;as well as some new raw materials left in the wake of the Burning Legion invasion.<br>
<br>
Quest to Be the Best<br>
First and foremost, you&#x2019;re going to find yourself going on more Profession-related quests than ever before. An Archaeology questgiver may want you to work with Brann Bronzebeard. A Jewelcrafting questgiver may challenge you to put the finishing touches on some gems. Only a commitment to working with your Profession trainers will earn you the most cutting-edge recipes. There are new quests related to most everything you do in each Profession, and as you learn your new and improved tradeskills, Profession-oriented quests will push you to rank up your recipes.<br>
<br>
Recipes With Ranks<br>
That&#x2019;s right, in Legion, you&#x2019;ll commit to your recipes to upgrade them, making them more efficient than they previously were. You can see each recipe&#x2019;s rank in stars in the updated Professions window.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Ranks also apply to your gathering Professions&#x2014;mining, herbalism, and skinning&#x2014;where you&#x2019;ll earn ranks of perks that make you a better gatherer.<br>
<br>
Obliterum and Blood of Sargeras<br>
You&#x2019;ll find that among the many new items related to Professions in Legion, two will surely stand out: Obliterum and Blood of Sargeras. You&#x2019;ll obtain Blood of Sargeras in a number of ways&#x2014;it can be an added drop when gathering or disenchanting, and can be received in all manner of quest and dungeon rewards.<br>
<br>
Blood of Sargeras is a rare reagent used in many recipes, from Engineering&#x2019;s Cranial Cannons (a gun you wear on your head) to Jewelcrafting&#x2019;s Chatterstone toy. Along with other reagents, Leatherworkers will use 25 Blood of Sargeras to craft the Great Northern Elderhorn mount.<br>
<br>
You&#x2019;ll obtain Obliterum by obliterating crafted gear at your Obliterum Forge in Dalaran.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Obliterum is the epic item that upgrades the item level of your crafted armor by 5, taking it from item level 815 all the way to item level 850. As with so many steps in your professional development, gaining access to your Obliterum Forge is the subject of a quest line.<br>
<br>
This Thing Goes to 800<br>
Every Profession in Legion has 100 new levels of fascinating and fel discoveries for you to make, as well as new and exciting adventures for you to undertake. Archaeology in the Broken Isles means new finds that can turn up a mount, a pet, a toy, and some items that are available via quests rather than digsites. Tailors can make clothes chests that allow others in their party or raid to try on a whole set of clothes in one click. First Aid quests will have you bandaging up the wounded on the front lines of the war against the invading Legion. Scribes will create valuable Vantus Runes, which increase your performance against a specific boss, and you&#x2019;ll want to savor Cooking, which now includes bacon. <br>
<br>
Some Blacksmiths will even learn how to craft a Steelbound Devourer mount!<br>

Group Loot Bugs<br>
We used Group Loot again in our raid last night and it is really getting frustrating. We are consistently having people that arent able to roll need on something that they want because of the iLvl restrictions, everyone in the raid was able to roll need on the Conq Tier Tokens even if they werent Paladin, Priest, Warlock .... <br>
There&apos;s a significant bug with Group Loot that posts like this have brought to light over the past day. On Leather and Mail armor, which has both Intellect and Agility, the presence of Intellect is incorrectly preventing Rogues and Hunters from rolling Need on those items. That&apos;s obviously unintended, and terrible. It shouldn&apos;t behave that way, and we&apos;re working towards a fix within the next day.<br>
<br>
The Tier Token behavior you mention is also unintended - class restrictions should be respected. We&apos;ll investigate and fix if something is awry there.<br>
<br>
No comment on the issue of iLvL restrictions preventing rolls? Or is that a working as intended with the intention being to really force PL on all situations and hope that altruism suddenly grows in the cesspit that is most of the playerbase?<br>
Sorry, I should have mentioned that. We don&apos;t believe that is currently happening, and it&apos;s absolutely not intended. If an item is for your class, you should be able to roll Need on it regardless. If it is specifically for your spec, your roll should take priority over off-spec rolls. And if an item is not for your class (unequippable or intended for a role your class cannot perform, such as a rogue looking at a tank trinket ), then you should only be able to roll Greed/DE. There should be no other logic or restrictions on the system, and if you encounter any, we&apos;d be very interested in hearing more.<br>
<br>
The reports we&apos;ve seen that seemed to blame player item level for inability to roll, thus far, were actually caused by the Rogue/Hunter issue I mentioned above.<br>

Forging a Hero - Arthas Statue<br>
Blizzard made a nice Arthas Statue for the 25th anniversary of the founding of Blizzard Entertainment!<br>
<br>

<br>
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the founding of Blizzard Entertainment; and what better way to celebrate this epic milestone, than by casting one of the company&#x2019;s most iconic characters in a 14 foot, 4,000 pound, truly one-of-a-kind statue. Located on the Calligraphy Greenway in Taichung, Taiwan, this bronze portrayal of the Lich King Arthas Menethil wasn&#x2019;t created just to commemorate an anniversary, but also to recognize and celebrate the incredible Taiwanese gaming community.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ve prepared a video below to give you a glimpse at how an army of talented individuals came together to bring one of Blizzard Entertainment&#x2019;s most tragic characters out of the game and into the world. We hope you can feel the effort and passion that went into making this concept a reality. <br>
<br>
A Word from Mike Morhaime:<br>
&#x201C;We are thrilled to see the unveiling of Arthas, created by Taiwanese designer, Steve Wang, happening in Taichung&#x201D;, said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. &#x201C;The statue of Arthas is not just for the 25th birthday of Blizzard, but it is also our appreciation to all gaming communities in Taiwan. We are looking forward to the next 25 years of epic gaming experiences.&#x201D;<br>

Curse Client v5 is being phased out, and all of its functionality is being added to the Curse app (https://www.curse.com/).<br>
<br>
Features<br>
<br>
Full Mac support<br>
Expanded localization support for many more languages<br>
No more ads<br>
Memory usage remains very low, even with full access to the feature-rich Curse app<br>
<br>
<br>
Process<br>
<br>
Stage one is rolling out WoW addons to the alpha Curse app. All alpha users will be able to check out the new World of Warcraft tab on the left navigation bar and immediately be able to access addon management.<br>
The second stage will push WoW addons to the live Curse app. The Curse app will also become the default download for new WoW addon users during this stage.<br>
The third stage will begin the migration of WoW Curse Client v5 users to the Curse app -- the client will provide information about the migration and point users to the Curse app. We are offering one free month of Curse Premium to all Curse Client v5 users who choose to migrate over to the Curse app during this stage as a thank you for trying it out early.<br>
The fourth and final stage will migrate all remaining Curse Client v5 users to the Curse app. The client will ask users to install the Curse app to continue managing their WoW addons.<br>
