Holy shit can I please stop being dumped into silvershard mines with 3 BM hunters. 3 BM hunters on any team is an instant loss.
what's your top BM Hunters In PvP complaint? Muffinus 

Thanks for being the BM Hunter hero we needed with regards to the tier set and Hati. If I could give you a bonus I would.
Can't take credit, all of these things were done by the class team before I said anything, they are pretty on top of stuff Muffinus 

Karazhan
i thought lfg for Karazhan was coming in 7.1.5? or is that later?
That's for Patch 7.2 WarcraftDevs
