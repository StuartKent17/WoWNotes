Legion PvP Season 1 Rewards
Some players did not receive their titles as expected - we are aware of this. We have a fix that will be deployed during realm restarts which should be happening within the next 24 hours. We’ve made sure that all eligible players are flagged correctly, and we expect this distribution to go smoothly.

We appreciate your patience with this, and thank you for your understanding. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/791266-legion-pvp-season-1-rewards/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20752439581?page=6#101

Holy shit can I please stop being dumped into silvershard mines with 3 BM hunters. 3 BM hunters on any team is an instant loss.
what's your top BM Hunters In PvP complaint? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/817182997933760512

Thanks for being the BM Hunter hero we needed with regards to the tier set and Hati. If I could give you a bonus I would.
Can't take credit, all of these things were done by the class team before I said anything, they are pretty on top of stuff Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/817476614107774977
