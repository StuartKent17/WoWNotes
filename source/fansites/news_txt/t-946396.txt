Boubouille2011-07-28, 07:05 AMPretty much nothing to news these days, mostly because Blizzard is busy with the Diablo 3 press tour I guess see this news post  

You will probably see updates on MMO-Champion as soon as the NDA is lifted if anything really important is announced there beta, end of the world, etc ... and in any cases you will get a full report on Diablofans.com  

Nothing new on the Patch 4.3 side yet, hopefully it will hit the test servers "soon" since Blizzard already mentioned in the past that they would release patches faster. 


Paragon VS Ragnaros 25man Heroic World First Kill Video
DREAM Paragon  released their video of the Ragnaros world first kill yesterday and I didn't have the occasion to embed it. However, something weird happened during the encoding and the quality was lower than intended. Paragon reuploaded the video with that problem fixed, enjoy!
