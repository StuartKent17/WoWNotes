Dark Ascension Changes - Battle for Azeroth<br>
Update on Dark Ascension (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/280711-dark-ascension):<br>
<br>
The next build&apos;s version will no longer have the requirement that you be out of Voidform to cast it. The goal with that requirement in the original design was to prevent players from wasting/incorrectly using it during Voidform to extend Voidform a bit via the Insanity it generates.<br>
<br>
Instead, with the next iteration, you can cast Dark Ascension at any time, and it activates a new Voidform, resetting your Insanity drain and Voidform stacks.<br>
<br>
You&apos;ll also keep any Insanity you currently had, and Generate 50 more (pending tuning) to add to that. We considered it resetting your Insanity to 0, then generating 50 afterwards, but that meant you&apos;d probably want to wait until Voidform is completely over before using Dark Ascension, which is counter to the design of the talent being both a flexible on-demand burst AOE and a way to enter/start a new Voidform whenever you choose.<br>
