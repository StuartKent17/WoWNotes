Oceanic WoW Classic Realms
We agree with the many WoW Classic enthusiasts in Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia that it will be a very good thing for players in that part of the world to connect to realms that are hosted in that part of the world.

Planned it all along!

We will have Oceanic realms for WoW Classic, with game servers hosted in Australia, at launch on August 27, and we’ll let you know the names of the Oceanic realms before name reservations start on August 13. Thanks!


WoW Classic “Not A Bug” List Update
I’ve updated the original post in this thread with:


“Melee leeway” is working as intended.


After careful study and testing, we’ve found that for players with low latency, the state of melee leeway is how they would have experienced the game in 2006.

There are more people with low latency now than there were in 2006, so we expect for some it might feel different, but it is working as expected.
