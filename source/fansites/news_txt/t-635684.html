In patch 3.1, a new world event titled &#x201C;The Argent Tournament&#x201D; will be coming to Northrend! This tournament will be live on the 3.1 PTR and open for testing, though certain aspects are still in development. Players will find a host of new features here, including:<br>
<br>
The ability to prove your worth to a capital city of your choosing through our new mounted combat system (still in development)<br>
New daily quests to construct the great Argent Crusade coliseum for glorious battles to come<br>
All new rewards - new items, titles, banners, tabards, pets, mounts, and more<br>
All new achievements<br>
Many more festivities, and more to come in future content updates!<br>
<br>
Players will find the Argent Tournament in Icecrown. Speaking to any Northrend flight master will get you on track to prove your worth to the Argent Crusade, your faction&#x2019;s leaders, and all denizens of Azeroth!</div></div>
