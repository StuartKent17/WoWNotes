Fall of Deathwing Not Yet Available in Raid Finder<br>
We would just like to let everyone know that the Fall of Deathwing is not open just yet for the Raid Finder or Heroic difficulties. We plan to open this encounter up in approximately one week. We felt it was important to let more people get through the fights in normal difficulty, make videos, strat guides, update their mods, etc. before we let everyone take a crack at Deathwing. We&#x2019;ll keep you informed when this part of the raid opens up for Raid Finder. Keep in mind that it&#x2019;s required to complete the first half to be able to queue for the second, so don&#x2019;t hold back!</div></div>
