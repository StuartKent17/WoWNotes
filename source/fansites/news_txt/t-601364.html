<br>
New honor belt/boots/bracers skins are in the game files, I was too lazy to get them, but it seems they&apos;ll be upgraded too (which explains why they&apos;re missing from the vendors for the moment)<br>
<br>
I couldn&apos;t get the Paladin shoulders, don&apos;t know if they&apos;re missing (possible) or if I was too stupid (even more possible)<br>
<br>
For any other information, check the previous news.<br>
