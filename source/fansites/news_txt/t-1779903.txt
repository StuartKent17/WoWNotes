Really strange change?"Capturing a point in the following Battlegrounds now takes 6 seconds down from 7 seconds."
Open to hearing feedback on it. holinka 
Seems unnecessary for the reasoning that ninja capping is already in a good place, making it easier seems too much.
Is it? Get a lot of feedback that maps like AB and Gilneas are very stagnant after initial captures. holinka 
essentially you've turned team fight maps into ninja the ninja maps. When gy were the culprit.
I can see that argument for AB but not Gilneas. holinka

"spectacle creep" sounds like blaming the audience for not liking your product... >.>
Did you watch the video? Has nothing to do with blaming the audience, it's about how making things exciting gets more difficult. Muffinus 
Guess MoP suffered from spectactle creep, but I personally enjoy the story as long as we don't regress in spectacle
I feel the opposite, MOP was pretty toned-down and relaxed imo, except for SoO. A nice breather. Muffinus
