<br>
Holy<br>
<br>
Guardian Spirit should no longer activate from damage that cannot kill the target (such as a Brewmaster&#x2019;s Stagger).<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeons<br>
<br>
The reputation and questing requirements to enter the Siege of Boralus and Kings&#x2019; Rest dungeons have been removed.<br>
The Battle for Azeroth Dungeons weekly event should now display the proper rewards.<br>
Temple of Sethraliss<br>
<br>
The visuals for Galvazzt&#x2019;s Galvanize beam should now be more responsive.<br>

<br>
Player versus Player<br>
<br>
The PvP quest &#x201C;Against Overwhelming Odds&#x201D; can no longer be completed while in a raid.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; Note: The intent of this quest is to incite aggression amongst players on the under represented faction throughout war mode. Allowing it to be completed in a raid focused too much of that aggression in one place in one large group. This change spreads the fight out into more parts of the world.<br>
<br>
The weekly PvP Call to Arms quests can no longer be completed while in a raid, and do not count kills on players below level 120 or with the Honorless Target debuff active.<br>
Resolved an issue that prevented players from earning the non-seasonal Challenger, Duelist, Rival, and Gladiator titles from Battle for Azeroth: Season 1 rank achievements.<br>
Isle of Conquest<br>
<br>
Siege Vehicles and Bombs no longer deal damage to enemy commanders.<br>
