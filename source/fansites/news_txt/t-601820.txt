Boubouille2007-08-30, 06:36 AM2.2 PTR Patch
New patch on PTR, only affecting arena gear swapping. You can now swap gear in the starting room, but not after the start of the fight. 

Malganis in CoT : Stratholme
Yesterday, a few people mailed me about the fact that you kill Mal'ganis in CoT : Stratholme according to Tigole in the interview. They said it was impossible because Mal'ganis plays an important role in Northrend, don't worry, he'll still be here. 

Anytime you killed Mal’Ganis in the Stratholme level of Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos, you only succeeded in slowing him down. His body would reform shortly thereafter to continue taunting Arthas and encourage him to take the path of insanityâ€¦ and power. 

No matter what happens to Mal’Ganis in the upcoming Caverns of Time instance, his mission to drive Arthas to Frostmourne will not be undone.

Draenei Male shoulders
Orc shoulders are getting fixed ... But it seems that Draenei shoulders became smaller in one of the PTR patch too. I'm not sure how much they scaled them down but it's an intended change.

This was an intended change, Male Draenei shoulders were larger than intended before.

Gilneas
Sorry, no Gilneas  anytime soon.

At this time, the nation of Gilneas which stands behind the Greymane Wall remains a secluded mystery. One day we may see the portcullis and the region open to visitors and explorers alike, but we do not know when or if that day will come.
