Heroic Leap Reliability
Completely changing Heroic Leap so it works like shadowstep or feral step it would make it much more reliable and useful in PvP, and it could be used to jump up platforms and get back on targets like shadowstep does.

This would actually be a step backwards in my eyes, the ability to choose the location you will land on Heroic Leap is a great offensive and defensive tool. I cannot count the number of times that Heroic Leap has saved my warrior from death by it being defensively, and on the other side, you can use it offensively gain ground on fleeing opponents or any of its many other applications.

I feel that adding a targeting requirement would lower the manoeuvrability of the class and remove the unique feel given by this ability. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
