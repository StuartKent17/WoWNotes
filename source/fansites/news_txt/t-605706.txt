Here dense forests surround a vast arctic wasteland littered with the massive, gleaming bones of perished dragons. In the center of this frozen expanse lies Wyrmrest Keep, a structure believed to be built by the world-shaping titans shortly after Azeroth's creation. Many legends hold that the five great Dragon Aspects were blessed within this fortress and given their charge to watch over the budding world. Perhaps it is for this reason that dragons nearing the end of their lives come to the Dragonblight to enrich the land with their passing.

Surrounding Wyrmrest Keep are five majestic dragon shrines: red, bronze, green, blue, and black, each blessed with the powers of its respective flight. In recent times the undead Scourge has laid siege to these shrines in an effort to further its attempts at raising terrifying new variations of undead dragons to serve the Lich King.

In an attempt to arrest these invasions, the red Dragon Aspect, Alexstrasza, has begun recruiting heroes to aid in the fight against the Scourge, even as the taunka and tuskarr wage their own desperate battles against the undead. The one-time Scarlet Crusade, now the Scarlet Onslaught, has arrived as well in the hopes of claiming victory in their ongoing campaign against the Lich King and his minions.

Both the Alliance and the Horde have begun establishing a presence in the Dragonblight, taking a particular interest in the barred entrance to Icecrown, Angrathar the Wrath Gate. There both factions have begun gearing up for the siege that will inevitably lead into the lair of the Lich King himself.

The immediate dangers of the Dragonblight are posed not only by the Lich King, however, but also by the blue dragonflight. Determined to manipulate all existing magic to serve his own purposes, the blue Dragon Aspect, Malygos, has ordered his flight to maneuver colossal machines into key positions over magical ley line clusters. Many believe that these dire constructs are intended to realign the paths of magical energy that course beneath the earth. If successful, Malygos's tampering could result in an ecological and magical catastrophe that would threaten not only the stability of Northrend, but ultimately the equilibrium of the entire world.

2.4 Patch soon ?
This post isn't very informative, however the comment made by Hortus is interesting. It looks like it's now too late to fix bugs on PTRs and the remaining bugs will be fixed on Live, could it be the sign of a release in March ?
It looks like this is specific to OS 10.3.9 it will be resolved for live but you will likely not have access to the PTR.
On the other side, Drysc reminds people that the preloading doesn't really mean anything.
No it's not, we always "pre-load" major patches, meaning the majority of the data that's complete this is generally art assets are downloaded in advance to help cut down on bandwidth constraints the day the patch actually goes live.


PvP Balance and Shadowpriests
If you really want to be a VERY efficient priest in PvP, maybe you should just respec. 
I do pretty well in battlegrounds with mine, but if I'm going to want to be viable in higher end competition then I would be well advised to respec. That isn't to say that shadow priests won't one day be more viable than they are now in PvP, or that changes may not come for other specs to help them become more viable. The point is that not every spec for every class should be expected to be as viable as the next for each aspect of the game.

Changes to inspection in 2.4
This is a new change that didn't make it into the patch notes yet. You can inspect anyone who you can not currently engage in combat with. So players in sanctuary areas such as Shattrath or if you and the other player are both un-flagged for PVP.

Season 4 won't start with the release of Patch 2.4
This is true, but Season 4 will not begin with the release of patch 2.4. That is guaranteed. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5288581012&postId=52353696066&sid=1#16

Bloodlust getting removed near a wall.
Bloodlust still gets removed if you use it when you are too close to a wall and cannot have your body made bigger by the buff. This is not a bug, it is intended functionality to prevent a bug players getting stuck in geometry when they grow.
