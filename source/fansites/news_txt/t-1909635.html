Legion - Nightfallen and Withered<br>
We previously looked at (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5327-Artifact-Trait-Calculator-Fishing-Artifact-Nightborne-Gnome-Hunters-Tweets) the Nightborne (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Nightborne). Today we are looking at the Nightfallen and Withered. When the Nightborne are exiled, they are cut off from the Nightwell. This transforms them into the Nightfallen and eventually Withered. <br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Developer Communication<br>
Question for you awesome people: Game devs get accused a lot of arrogance. How do you know when a dev is being authentically humble? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667101654731259904))<br>
Can&apos;t think of any &apos;humble&apos; devs, but humble can be very close to &apos;pushover&apos;. But if you need the opposite go find @Holinka.<br>
Also, if someone thinks I&apos;m arrogant because I troll people who insult me personally, I&apos;m fine with that. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/667496340604096512))<br>
I think the community wants more admittance to poor design<br>
One challenge there is once you admit a mistake, there can be an expectation that it will be fixed very quickly. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667499497681891328))<br>
<br>
Interviews Watcher with are so good because he doesn&apos;t do this. He admits mistakes and seems to know what players think.<br>
Do you think players often claim &quot;arrogant&quot; when what they mean is &quot;I disagree with your direction?&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667145459559895040))<br>
Yes. He is very good at not spinning things. You can trust what he says. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667145668608176128))<br>
<br>
My view of you changed over time aswell. Often you were seen by the community as the decider &amp; bringer of bad news/nerfs <br>
I&apos;m not a fan of the &quot;spokesperson&quot; policy. The more devs who communicate, the more real the whole org appears to be. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667467047152955392))<br>
<br>
You gave me a headache! Btw, why the focus on humble? Why not something else (empathetic, informative, ...)?<br>
I don&apos;t get accused that much of lacking empathy or not sharing information. Arrogant comes up a lot so I wanted to dive into it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667488409691123712))<br>
<br>
Arrogance is easier to achieve with 140 characters.<br>
.That is true! I know I come across as flippant on Twitter because I lack characters for nuance. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667494496377004033))<br>
<br>
If you could guarantee &quot;flawless&quot; CM feedback, would you still communicate with players? And why?<br>
Great question. I think so, just because I personally enjoy it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667727075122409472))<br>
Also, no disrespect to CMs, but players probably also enjoy being able to reach devs directly. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667727256282787840))<br>
<br>
What if there was a better way to structure the community? Some people are much better at feedback and others dilute them<br>
I&apos;ve considered some kind of &quot;anyone can view but invite only to post.&quot; Would that feel too velvet ropey? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667868516595269633))<br>
<br>
Reputation / Questing<br>
What&apos;s your take on WoW starting zones ? For example, what would you change if you could ?<br>
We redid Elwynn a couple of times while I was there. Emphasis was on showing a good time and telling the story, not teaching. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/666428377239191552))<br>
I do think you end up killing tiny wildlife for a bit too long in most zones. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/666428466036764672))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
success breeds arrogance. It&apos;s human nature.<br>
It&apos;s funny because I see the opposite where I work. Success just creates greater pressure to live up to those expectations. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667145296435003392))<br>
