We will be releasing a patch on Wednesday October, 10 beginning at 8:30 a.m. PDT to resolve an issue that could sometimes prevent players from interacting correctly with in-game objects.

Blue Posts
Ink Trader Exchange Change
Unfortunately, when attempting to apply the hotfix, we ran into additional issues in testing. We don't have an ETA on when this will be able to be applied as of yet, but will be continuing to work on it. It's not a cut and dry fix unfortunately. Again, we appreciate everyone's patience while we work this out. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Losing Hit in Challenge Modes
I know this thread’s a few days old now, but I’d like to clarify the cause for concern here so others are aware. Balkoth, we were able to track down a bug pertaining to item scaling in Challenge Modes, but it’s not related solely to classes that use a spirit -> hit conversion. 

What you’re noticing is a bug specifically involving reforging. If you reforge out of crit/haste/mastery INTO hit or expertise, then when the crit/haste/mastery gets scaled down, you also lose a percentage of the reforged hit/expertise. So, it's not a class or spec issue -- it affects all players who have reforged into hit/spirit equally.

Given the way stat scaling and reforging mechanics work, this is kind of a tricky issue to fix, but we’re looking into it. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Taming the World Achievement
For players that have yet to reach 40, the hotfix applied today should allow you to earn the achievement Taming the World  when you do instead of at 45.

For those who have already hit 40 or higher and don't have the achievement, we're in the process of developing another hotfix to correctly award you. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Darkmoon Ox Deck Trinket Hotfix
While I'm very happy that this trinket received a buff thank you! in a timely manner, Nethaera, can you comment or inquire as to why using this trinket puts any engineering glove tinker on the same cooldown as the trinket itself?

It happens with all of my existing glove tinkers, even ones with little relation to dodging. I can understand giving it a slight cooldown in combination with Phase Fingers, but Synapse Springs?
This is unintended and we intend to hotfix this in the near future no eta I can give you but it shouldn't be long. The intended functionality is that On Use effects from trinkets, and Engineering glove tinkers, only applies a short cooldown equal to their effect duration to the others.

Daily Questing
2. How on earth can any say dailies be counted as content? it is not! it is a timesink, but content they are not. Content would be a long questline for your profession, for your reputation or just for the fun. But to repeat the dailies have nothing to do with content, it is just Blizzard that are to cheap to make real content, so they make this silly timesink.
But they are content. Take the Kovok daily in Dread Wastes. Unless you do the daily quest when it pops up, you won't see that quest, nor how the area around Heart of Fear changes for it. Nor you'll understand what the paragon meant when he says he was sure Kovok would achieve many victories for the Klaxxi. And that's just one example the race daily for the Cloud Serpents is another example. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

LFR Loot System
Just an idea, but maybe put a little message in the chat screen when players enter a dungeon to inform them of this.
As this is a fairly new feature, it's bound to be improved over time. I think some sort of messaging is probably a good idea; I'll pass that suggestion to the devs along with some of the feedback that was presented on this thread.

But the system that was promised and displayed was that each player would have a seperate roll system on their own, I never saw that feature on the game.
Brace Yourselves LFR looting system is coming!

Only to LFR of course.
You should be able to see it working tomorrow right after the maintenance is over. 
You need to be level 90 and a minimum of 460 average ilvl if you wish to enter the first part of Mogu'shan Vaults LFR that will be opening tomorrow.

Have fun and may the purples shine radiantly on you! Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Account Bound Flying Skill Tomes
The tomes that we've added in WotLK were something that we just wanted to try and experiment with, we're not sure if we're going to create a similar option for Pandaria.

We feel that a big part of the experience would be lost if we decided to add such an option for alts, so much of the world design would be rendered meaningless by having the possibility to skip over any obstacle, and a lot of content would also probably be missed by the players.

I suppose that the argument “my main character already experienced all the world content” makes some sense, if you’ve done it once, you’re not missing anything with your alts, right? But how many players have actually really seen it all while levelling just one character? 
If this is about gameplay experience, I think we’re better off with staying put on the ground while levelling, but if it has to do with the levelling pace, we think there are better alternatives that we can explore if we decide that we want to speed up the character’s levelling speed in the near future.

Still, the tome option is not completely out of the picture, it’s something developers are carefully thinking about and might still consider, so please do continue to provide feedback about it, as it always has some weight when designers/producers have to make such decisions.
