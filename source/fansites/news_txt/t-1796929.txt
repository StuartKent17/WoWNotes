Darkmoon Faire Races
The Darkmoon Faire is back again, bringing us the final race, in addition to the other Patch 6.1 changes  The Powermonger is the new mount this time around.

The first race uses the smaller course, allowing you to earn Powermonger: Gold  and the Gaze of the Darkmoon 

The second race uses the big course, allowing you to earn Big Powermonger: Gold  and the Darkmoon Cannon  The Cannon is not a toy, so it will take up an additional inventory slot. 

The Powermonger mount jumps to powerups  It also has a Battery  ability that absorbs the next powerup you hit in the next 4 seconds. This powerup can then be used later by using the Battery ability again. The Overwrite  ability allows you to overwrite a nearby powerup with the stored one, but requires the currency powerup. It isn't necessary to earn the achievements. The final ability, Summon Aggrobots , will taunt the mini-zeppelins, allowing you to pass by without getting stunned. 

The trick this month is to jump to springs and use the battery to absorb the spring right before you land on it. This allows you to use the spring to jump twice, once when you hit it and once again with the stored jump. You also can store a rocket before the big race to jump up the cliff to the first checkpoint. This can be accomplished by starting a race, storing your rocket, running back, abandoning the quest, and starting again.

PvP
In addition, Ashran should not put entire raids into 1 instance. People are getting rofl-stomped by premades. @holinka
You won't be able to enter Ashran while in a raid. holinka 

this problem was adressed in several forum posts during alpha and beta.but some forums feel like a dead end especially non-US.
Based on feedback from players during beta, we gave all players passive expertise. The issue at hand is to increase it. holinka 
that change felt like motivated by pve bosses turning around into parry etc. at least the way it was communitcated.
The passive expertise I mentioned is associated with Battle Fatigue, a PvP only buff, so it's probably a different issue. holinka 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs  appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Flying
What's your stand on the "no more flying in WoW" stance the devs have taken?
Even if you don't like a particular change, you should want people unafraid to make bold decisions running your game. OccupyGStreet 
Not everyone wants a taxi driver bold enough to risk getting both of you killed trying to get to the airport though.
I'm not looking for a taxi ride to keep me engaged though. I very much ask that of a game. OccupyGStreet 

These have all been successfully countered in previous expansions by creative design.
I can understand the argument that it's tough to live without flying once you are used to it genie in a bottle analogy. OccupyGStreet 
OTOH I don't put much stock into the argument that clever quest and level design can make flight as challenging as ground. OccupyGStreet 
The combat wasn't designed with 3d space in mind. They could build all that, or they could focus all that attention elsewhere. OccupyGStreet 
I kinda think orcs firing nets constantly and every quest objective inside a cave would get tiring quickly. OccupyGStreet 
Much more interested in the difference in flight speed. Allowing flight at a low speed and gaining speed in xpac = prog
We messed with that some. It always felt very forced and awkward. Not saying it isn't theoretically possible. OccupyGStreet 
I think if you want aerial combat, you build a game about aerial combat. Adding it in later is challenging and we tried in Lk. OccupyGStreet 

Grounding while leveling is a begrudgingly accepted pathway. However, 6 months to a year into an xpac, flight wouldn't harm.
Maybe. I'm not informed enough to have an opinion on the current content. OccupyGStreet
