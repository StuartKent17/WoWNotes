Arena Tournament Battle<br>
GMs and members of the community team will be on Tournament Test Realm once again today ! You might want to drop by if you missed it the first time. <br>
We&#x2019;re once again bringing the fight to the Tournament Test Realm (TTR) and challenging players in the 2v2, 3v3, and 5v5 arena brackets. Blizzard will be out in force taking on any challengers and making personal appearances near the various vendor locations.<br>
<br>
The Tournament Arena Battle will take place on Wednesday between 5:00 PM PDT and 8:00 PM PDT, and members of the Community and Development teams will once again be present to dispense mayhem and destruction upon all who challenge them. You&#x2019;ll be able to easily spot any Blizzard employees as we&#x2019;ll be the only players who are in a guild, which will be &#x201C;Blizzard Entertainment&#x201D; for Horde, and &#x201C;Blizzard&#x201D; for Alliance.<br>
<br>
As this is a stress test we do anticipate that the realms will be stressed to their maximum capacities and there is the possibility issues may occur. Have no fear, we&#x2019;ll be watching and waiting to resolve any issues that may crop up as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
Visit http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/ptr/ (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/ptr/) to begin downloading the PTR client if you haven&#x2019;t already. No character copies will be needed for this unique event as you will get access to the character and gear of your choice just by logging in. The 2.4 PTR client will provide access to the Tournament realm so download it soon and we&#x2019;ll see you in the arenas!<br>
If you didn&apos;t see them two days ago, here are the screenshots of the latest Arena Tournament Battle event held during the week end.<br>

Fixes/changes included in major content patches<br>
So ... Why does it take so long to get things fixed sometimes, just because Blizzard wants to add it in a &quot;big&quot; patch and not just fix some of these issues during a maintenance ? Tigole answers. <br>
1) From a technical standpoint, we can&apos;t make some of the changes stated above without patching the client and server. We *need* to patch them in. We can&apos;t just make those changes magically appear during maintenance. Some of those changes are beyond the scope of what is possible in a hotfix as well. We&apos;d love to be able to change stuff like that on the fly, but we can&apos;t do it from a technical standpoint.<br>
<br>
2) Even if we could do those changes without a patch, it would be very risky. Any change, however small, can cause a ripple effect of bugs in the game. It&apos;s very important to test out any change before pushing it live.<br>
<br>
3) Assuming there were no bugs, we still want to see things on the PTR to test things from a design standpoint. Think about all of the changes that were done in 2.4 which were eventually backed out. The change to drinking, the class changes etc. We need to see how some of these ideas play out in a semi-live environment first.<br>

WotLK system requirements<br>
If your computer can run Burning Crusade, WotLK should work just fine. <br>
What I&apos;m saying is that we are continuing to develop with as many users as possible in mind. I&apos;m not going to call out any specifics since we haven&apos;t publicized any at this point in time. I couldn&apos;t tell you if any upgrades would be needed or not since it depends on your machine and what it can handle. The likelihood of us switching to any one particular platform after supporting what we do right now, would be very low.</div></div>
