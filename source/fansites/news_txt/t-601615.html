Yes, the expansion is World of Warcraft : Wrath of the Lich King. You can stop posting fakes. See you on August 3rd. <br>
<br>
Of course this information isn&apos;t backed up by any official source, etc, etc, etc. And I personally don&apos;t have informations about the Deathknight, I can only confirm the expansion name. <br>

Update : See this post for confirmation.</div></div>
