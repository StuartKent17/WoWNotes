Patch 5.4.7 - Charge and Warbringer Changes
The latest PTR build removed the stun from Charge  and added it to the Warbringer talent. It looks like the next build will revert this change and instead make Pummel  and Disrupting Shout  have a shared cooldown.
We're going to revert the Charge and Warbringer changes from the 5.4.7 PTR and make a different change. Here's some context:

We feel that Warriors are too disruptive vs casters in PvP at the moment. To a certain extent it's intended that it should be more difficult to get casts off if there's a melee DPS sticking to you, but Warriors just have too many options along those lines currently. That's part of the thinking behind the change to Charge: as a root, Charge would not interrupt casting, so it would be useful purely as a gap closer and rage generator, not as a way to lock down a caster.

We're reverting it because, although we do think it's a good change and something we're likely to revisit in the future, it's a bit too big of an overall change for 5.4.7. There's a bit of a ripple effect here; making Charge a root certainly accomplishes the goal of scaling back Warrior interrupts, but it opens up some secondary issues such as "what happens when you Charge a target with Hand of Freedom active?" that we'd need some additional time to clear up. Put another way, we wanted to nerf Warriors' ability to disrupt casters, not their mobility, and at this point in time the Charge change would have been a nerf to both.

So instead, we're making a different change: Pummel and Disrupting Shout will have a 15-second shared cooldown. To be clear: Disrupting Shout will remain at its current 40 second cooldown, but you won't be able to use it within 15 seconds of using Pummel. Likewise, using Disrupting Shout will put Pummel on cooldown.

We may still come back to the Charge change in Warlords, where all sorts of other changes will have happened especially to CC that allow it to make more sense, and we can spend more development and testing time on making sure it doesn't have any unwanted side effects. For now, the shared cooldown on Pummel and Disrupting Shout will fill our original intention of making Warriors just slightly less difficult to cast against.

Art
Will the male Draenei finally get real eyebrows, like they have in the concept art? 
We're definitely looking at all existing concept art and considering these kinds of additions. artofcgrobinson 

Can i get a confirmation that female undead 1h special attack animation will continue to be an amazing flip attack?
the plan is to not significantly alter existing animation, just polish - so yes that will remain the same artofcgrobinson 

Warlords of Draenor Stats
Wait, is each individual affected spell going to have its own Readiness coefficient?
No. It's per spec, just like Mastery. Celestalon 

Final question of the night, will amplify have a rating i.e. +20 amplify or just a static x% boost on gear?
Rating. Celestalon 

any estimated date on the Item Squish so far?
Squish will happen with 6.0. Celestalon 

PvP
So as MMO-C showed alliance won 84.9% of IoC last month, could that be because of bad map balance? Too me it feels like it.
there was a bug in 5.3 where alliance could leave the starting area early & ally HK farming groups focus on IoC. holinka 

The problem is faction imbalance and no efforts made to address it. I pvp as ally for near insta-q's 0-2 min.
Certainly. But faction balance has fluctuated over the games lifetime. One popular guild moves and many follow. holinka 

Misc
itâ€™s the perception of mandatory spend versus optional that makes the difference. I.e. Pay 2 compete = bad! pay for cool pet = good
The qualifier "optional" isn't sufficient. It's subjective on what optional means & often the option is wait longer or play more. holinka
