mountequipmentMount Equipment<br>
Patch 8.2 adds an item slot to your mount collection tab that allows you to socket a mount ability to benefit all of your mounts.<br>
Every hero has their favorite mount&#x2014;whether it&#x2019;s Baron Rivendare&#x2019;s steed, Kael&#x2019;thas Sunstrider&#x2019;s beloved pet Al&#x2019;ar, or the very first pony you purchased back when you earned Apprentice Riding skill. The Mount Equipment you earn, craft, and purchase in Rise of Azshara will make it so your choice of mount can be steered by your heart&#x2014;not what&#x2019;s most efficient.<br>
<br>
These new Mount Equipment pieces can be applied to your mounts within the mount collection tab; they apply to most of your mounts,* and are available for anyone to use regardless of which professions they have (though note that they don&#x2019;t work in Battlegrounds or Arenas). Take a look at the options you&#x2019;ll have available!<br>
<br>
<br>
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/june/thumb/mountequipment.png (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/june/mountequipment.png)<br>
<br>
Equipment Name: Anglers&apos; Water Striders (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168416-anglers-water-striders)<br>
What it does: Allows you to walk on water while mounted. Damage will cancel the effect.<br>
Where to get it: If you&#x2019;ve already earned the Water Strider, Nat Pagle will mail you the new Anglers&#x2019; Water Striders. They&#x2019;ll bind to your Blizzard account and allow any of your mounts to make like a Shaman (or bug) and walk on water.<br>
If you haven&#x2019;t earned the Water Strider, you&#x2019;ll need to reach Exalted reputation with The Anglers in Mists of Pandaria to pick these up.<br>
<br>
Equipment Name: Light-Step Hoofplates (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168412-light-step-hoofplates)<br>
What it does: Increases your mount&#x2019;s ground speed by 20%. Doesn&#x2019;t stack with other mount speed effects.<br>
Where to get it: Check with your local Enchanter or visit the auction house. Enchanters with a minimum Battle for Azeroth skill level of 155 can learn to create these speed-boosting items. Gotta go fast!<br>
<br>
Equipment Name: Saddlechute (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168427-saddlechute)<br>
What it does: These life-saving devices install an emergency parachute that will automagically deploy whenever you&#x2019;re dismounted while high in the air. Equip these and avoid those really embarrassing slip and falls!<br>
Where to get it: Pay a visit to your neighborhood Tailor or look in the auction house. Tailors with a minimum Battle for Azeroth skill level of 150 can learn to create these airship captain&#x2013;approved safety devices.<br>
<br>
Equipment Name: Comfortable Rider&apos;s Barding (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168419-comfortable-riders-barding)<br>
What it does: Never again will you have to utter the phrase &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t daze me, bro,&#x201D; when you slap on this protective Mount Equipment option. It prevents you from being Dazed while mounted&#x2014;like all Mount Equipment, they don&#x2019;t work in Battlegrounds or Arenas, as that would provide an unfair advantage.<br>
Where to get it: Look for your local Leatherworker or check the auction house. Leatherworkers with a minimum Battle for Azeroth skill level of 150 can learn to stitch these together. <br>
<br>
Equipment Name: Inflatable Mount Shoes (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168417-inflatable-mount-shoes)<br>
What it does: If making friends with the Anglers isn&#x2019;t in the cards for you, this is one more way to help your favorite mount walk on water, though damage will cancel the effect.<br>
Where to get it: Barter with your local Blacksmith or head to the auction house. Blacksmiths with a minimum Batttle for Azeroth skill level of 150 can learn to forge these items.<br>
<br>
More than 400 mounts are currently available in World of Warcraft&#x2014;with even more to come&#x2014;and we look forward to seeing which mounts you equip and bring along on your next adventure!<br>
<br>
*Select mounts do not benefit from Mount Equipment such as the Sky Golem.<br>
<br>
<br>
watermountsNazjatar - Use Water Mounts on Land<br>
The Budding Deepcoral (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/169885-budding-deepcoral) is an item in Nazjatar that allows you to ride your underwater mounts like normal mounts in Nazjatar. This item costs 5 Prismatic Manapearl (https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1721-prismatic-manapearl) and can be purchased from the same vendors that sell the Benthic Gear (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8502-Patch-8-2-PTR-Benthic-Gear-Preview-Raid-Testing-Schedule-May-9-10-DLC-677) in Nazjatar. The item is consumed on use and doesn&apos;t provide any indication that the item is active. It persists through log outs, but is removed the moment you leave Nazjatar and must be repurchased to use again.<br>

Pet battlers will be able to explore a new Stratholme pet battle dungeon to collect a ton of new pets!<br>
<br>
<br>

It&#x2019;s time to marshal your menagerie and put your best battle pets forward in the undead streets of Stratholme, a new Pet Battle Dungeon with Normal and Challenge difficulties.<br>
<br>
To get started on your journey, you&#x2019;ll need to have earned the achievement All Growns Up! (have one level-25 pet) for Normal difficulty or Pro Pet Group (have 15 level-25 pets) for Challenge difficulty. This will open up a new quest from Tizzy Gearjolt in Boralus or Fuselock in Dazar&#x2019;alor. You won&#x2019;t need to complete the previous pet battle dungeons to gain access, and once the upcoming Rise of Azshara content update hits, you&#x2019;ll be able to play through all four pet battle dungeons in any order.<br>
<br>
You&#x2019;ll find pets from the undead, dragonkin, and magic families in Stratholme. You&#x2019;ll be able to heal and revive your pets between each of the 12 stages in Normal difficulty, but not in Challenge difficulty.<br>
<br>
Defeating the dungeon on Normal difficulty will earn players an Ultimate Battle-Training Stone. You&#x2019;ll also be able to avail yourself of Manapoof&#x2019;s aid to teleport directly to Stratholme&#x2019;s dungeon entrance as a part of the quest reward.<br>
<br>
Those who prove themselves to be the very best on Challenge difficulty will earn the achievement Pet Battle Challenge: Stratholme along with the Minimancer pet. Completing Challenge difficulty will count toward a weekly quest that rewards Cleansed Remains, an account-bound currency that you redeem for an Unopened Stratholme Supply Crate filled with pet supplies, or four new pets&#x2014;Ziggy, Crypt Fiend, Shrieker, and Gruesome Belcher. Speak with Sean Wilkers at the entrance of the dungeon to add one of these spooky fiends to your ranks.<br>
<br>
Whether you&#x2019;re new to pet battle dungeons or a companion-combat veteran, you&#x2019;ll want to get in on the ongoing story as it unfolds. Who are the shadowy figures that keep appearing in each pet battle dungeon? What chilling experiment are they conducting in Baron Rivendare&#x2019;s slaughterhouse? Will you come upon an opportunity to take the fight to them?<br>
<br>
Discover what awaits your critter pals next in Stratholme!<br>

<br>
New PvP Event: Battle for Nazjatar<br>
Players who have War Mode enabled in Nazjatar will be able to take part in a new PvP event to earn rewards and achievements. During the Battle for Nazjatar event, the Horde and the Alliance will need to coordinate their forces to capture and hold five points across the zone: Ala&#x2019;thir Spire, Lemor&#x2019;athra Spire, Thoras&#x2019;tal Spire, Tidal Conflux, and Zin-Azshari.<br>
<br>
Once towers are captured, the Horde and Alliance will begin to accumulate points for each tower under their control. The first faction to reach 10,000 points, or whoever has the most points at the end of 45 minutes, will claim victory.<br>
<br>
If you&#x2019;ve defeated at least one enemy player during the event, the first win of the day will reward 200 Conquest and 10 Nazjatar Battle Commendations, while the losing faction will still receive a small amount of Conquest and Nazjatar Battle Commendations, which can be exchanged for rewards including the imposing Inkscale Deepseeker mount.<br>

mountsizeupdateGnome and Tauren Mount Size Update<br>
With today&#x2019;s PTR update, you might notice mount size changes for gnome and tauren player characters. For a very long time, we&#x2019;ve had issues that stem from gnomes and tauren riding on mounts that appear larger than intended. We&#x2019;re adjusting their sizing down on normal* mounts.<br>
<br>
This allows us to correct many art and animation bugs with these specific races when mounted, and they look better. Gnomes and tauren now look more like they should, gnomes can actually reach their reins, and tauren can fit through more doorways when mounted.<br>
<br>
Here&#x2019;s an example of how a gnome character looks when mounted-<br>
<br>
Before the change-<br>
<br>
<br>
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/may/thumb/gtmount01.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/may/gtmount01.jpg) <br>
<br>
And after the change-<br>
<br>

https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/may/thumb/gtmount02.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/may/gtmount02.jpg) <br>
<br>
This new tech also means that it&#x2019;s now possible for us to address issues where some mounts are too small on some races. We&#x2019;re looking to find examples along those lines, so please keep your feedback coming.<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>
<br>
*There are a few mounts that are not considered &quot;normal&quot;-sized to begin with. For example, Hyena mounts are considered &quot;small&quot;, and we&#x2019;re not sizing tauren differently on small mounts at this time.<br>

experienceExperience Eliminated Aura<br>
WarcraftSecrets (https://twitter.com/WarcraftSecrets/status/1140393688272723969) pointed out that Patch 8.2 adds Experience Eliminated (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/206662-experience-eliminated), which reduces XP from mobs and quests by 95% if anyone in the group has experience disabled. <br>
<br>
The change only affects groups that manually invite player characters who have XP off. There is no impact on players who find themselves automatically grouped by the matchmaker while doing PvP or Group Finder dungeons. This change also doesn&#x2019;t affect anyone who has turned off XP for their own benefit, such as plundering old raids while keeping their level low enough to use their Aggramar&#x2019;s Stride boots. This was likely done to stop Level 110 characters from boosting players to 120 quickly. <br>

operationmechagonNew Mega Dungeon: Operation Mechagon<br>
A new eight boss mega dungeon is coming on July 9th with unique gear and rewards to earn.<br>
Once you&#x2019;re feeling properly upgraded, it&#x2019;s time to begin your bid to shut down King Mechagon once and for all and free the mechagnomes from his tyranny. Get ready for Operation Mechagon!<br>
<br>
Operation Mechagon <br>
<br>
<br>
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/june/thumb/operationmechthumb.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/june/operationmech.jpg) <br>
<br>
Prince Erazmin leads a group of unlikely allies on a desperate mission into the heart of Mechagon. In a race against time, they must overcome King Mechagon&#x2019;s army of mechanized monstrosities and defeat the mad genius before his doomsday device purges all organic life from Azeroth.<br>
<br>
Dungeon Bosses: 8<br>
<br>
Difficulties: Mythic<br>
<br>
Level: 120 for Alliance and Horde<br>
<br>
King Gobbamak: Obsessed with hoarding dangerous technology found amongst the scrap, King Gobbamak sits upon a pile of doomsday weapons that he lacks the intelligence to operate or understand.<br>
<br>
Gunker: After years of coalescing into a concentrated cesspool. Mechagon&apos;s toxic waste has gained malevolent sentience. With the sanitation systems disabled, Gunker is free to ooze across all of Azeroth.<br>
<br>
Trixie &amp; Naeno: Trixie and Naeno, two of Bondo&#x2019;s top lieutenants, have a turbulent relationship. While Trixie prides herself on ruthless efficiency, Naeno is the embodiment of chaos while behind the wheel. The only thing they have in common is their penchant for senseless violence, which they enjoy dispensing on anyone foolish enough to wander into their territory.<br>
<br>
HK-8 Aerial Oppression Unit: Predator of the skies, the HK-8 Aerial Oppression Unit soars over the yard executing its prime directive, disintegrating all trespassers. With impenetrable armor and a lethal host of weapons, it annihilates all who are caught in its shadow.<br>
<br>
Tussle Tonks: Mechagon&#x2019;s premier mechgineers test their mettle (and metal) by building customized combat robots. While these tonks typically battle each other for glory, they combine their efforts to repel foolhardy organic intruders who dare venture into Mechagon.<br>
<br>
K.U.-J.O.: As the repository for the city&#x2019;s refuse, the Under Junk is a prime target for gnomes from Bondo&#x2019;s gang who intend to steal valuable mechanical components. While Trash Mistress Wendy Cogsworth ceaselessly sorts the city&#x2019;s junk, her loyal guard dog, K.U.-J.0., keeps out unwelcome intruders&#x2014;mechagnomes and adventurers alike.<br>
<br>
Machinist&apos;s Garden: Beautiful and dangerous, Head Machinist Sparkflux&apos;s metallic gardens are designed for both recreation and retribution. With a flick of a switch, the idyllic scenery transforms into a death trap from which no interloper can escape.<br>
<br>
King Mechagon: As maniacal as he is brilliant, King Mechagon despises all organic life. With his mechoriginator primed and ready, nothing stands in the way of his scheme to purge the curse of flesh from Azeroth and mechanize the entire world.<br>
<br>
Get ready to face the danger within beginning July 9.<br>
