Patch 5.4.2 Hotfixes - January 21
Classes

Resolved an issue for the following abilities that resulted in damage being calculated incorrectly when used against targets with a greater than 75% reduction to damage from armor.

Guardian Druids with greater than 75% damage reduction from Armor were getting less than the intended amount of Vengeance. Now they will gain the correct amount.

Bladefist been taken off the connection date again?
Unfortunately it's been temporarily postponed. Haomarush and Dragonmaw was on the list too, and that's also been delayed. I'll let you know as soon as they're back on the schedule, sorry for the hold-up guys.

So is it you that I need to poke to fix the Argent Charger/Ebon Hold Gryphon not being account wide? 
Hey, I hotfixed this. Should be live soon. Thanks for mentioning! Dave_Maldo https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/420989751018004480
BAD NEWS! Data was fixed but when pushed LIVE made a mess. T_T Have to wait for a patch & new tech/DB crawl. Dave_Maldo https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421085094808281088

Xmog question. Thoughts on opening up FoS for Vanilla GM PvP Gear account wide? Have the FoS on my priest, want to Xmog Pally.
Up to item peeps. Doesn't seem to jive w/ their current thinking but who knows. Dave_Maldo https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421510501453950976

Any chance of us ever being able to do Dragon Soul LFR higher than 85? Really nice xmog sets in there!
Unlikely that it'll just be opened up as is, but future system changes may make such viable. Until then, grab some friends! Dave_Maldo https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/420979471449993216

Still xmog query, what about making tier sets complete. Like dk tier 10.25 or warrior tier 10.5?
I often pester the poor item peeps about that sort of thing. I hope one day we can do a comprehensive cosmetic gear pass. Dave_Maldo https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421509071385026560

PvP
will there be a new mount available with the achieve "glorious combatant"? Just got my tiger & love love love it.
Unfortunately, there won't be. It's going to be a little unorthodox content-wise. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421713959469580288
thank you for the reply! 
The idea behind them is that since they are character only, you may want to do it next season for an alt. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421718543139237888
will there be an adjustment so I can solo pve mobs easier or will I have to collect a pve set to do pve things? I assume the latter
Even at ilevel 522 the PvP gear is pretty good for killing world mobs. But the new PvP gear will have a higher ilevel. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421724594479718400

I know WoD brings a new PvP zone, are we going to see any new bg maps? Not a new game type but maybe ex AB gameplay but new map?
We're focusing our bg efforts for launch on the tools side so we can make bgs faster and creating Ashran. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421724431572942849

Is it in the plans to add a 500k and 1 million hk's achievement by the launch of WoD?
We won't add those until we find a good way to fix the HK farming that goes on in battlegrounds like IoC. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421718304508493826
