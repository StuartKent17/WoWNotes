35+ Artifact Traits Disabled In Instanced PvP Until Legion PvP Season 3<br>
Character progression is a core element of World of Warcraft, and that includes PvP. In Legion, empowering your Artifact to become stronger is a key part of character progression. When Artifact Knowledge levels were low at the beginning of the expansion, we deactivated the 35+ Artifact Traits in instanced PvP to avoid having large power gaps when compared to players who hadn&apos;t made much progress on their Artifact yet.<br>
<br>
In Patch 7.1.5, we added several methods that allow players to catch up their Artifact progression very quickly. Brand new players can advance up to Artifact Knowledge level 15 without any research time, and existing players can mail Artifact Knowledge Compendiums to alts, which immediately bring them as high as level 20. At this point, the power gap between a player with 35+ traits in their Artifact and a player just starting out is significantly less of a concern, as the gap can be closed very rapidly. For those reasons, we felt that Patch 7.1.5 was the right time to re-open Artifact progression to PvPers who had already earned the first 34 traits.<br>
<br>
However, we did not communicate this change (and its purpose) with enough advance notice to allow players to effectively prepare for it. Furthermore, while the improvements in Patch 7.1.5 make it much easier to unlock those final traits for new players or alternate characters, they weren&apos;t available until today. While we still believe activating these traits is the correct choice for World of Warcraft PvP, the middle of an ongoing season is not the right time to make this change.<br>
<br>
As of a few minutes ago, we&apos;ve applied a hotfix that once again disables the 35+ Artifact Traits in instanced PvP on North American and Oceanic servers. In other regions, this hotfix will be applied with the patch. The 35+ Artifact Traits will remain disabled for Legion PvP Season 2.<br>
<br>
Once Season 3 begins, we&apos;ll re-enable them. Note that Patch 7.2 will include some further expansions to the Artifact system that will make it highly valuable to have spent some Artifact Power on those traits (another reason we feel it&apos;s important that they be enabled in PvP). We&apos;ll have more details to share on those changes once Patch 7.2 has begun its public testing phase.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your feedback and understanding on this topic.<br>

Travel Form SpeedBug<br>
Can someone explain why they felt the need to nerf travel forms base speed from 200 to 180%?<br>
This is a bug and we currently have a hotfix in the works to resolve it. I&apos;ll update this thread if I hear anything more.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the heads up, and we appreciate your patience on this. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/792059-travel-form-nerf-trying-to-understand/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20752529464?page=3#49))<br>

Banning Botters<br>
Customer Support checking in - we definitely can and do continue to action bots. However, there might not always be landmark sweeps where thousands of voices suddenly cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced. These actions happen on a couple levels. <br>
<br>
Some are as simple as a Game Master investigating individual reports and we don&apos;t need more information on that particular system: we can close them down immediately. Other cases, we observe, monitor, and then detect/break the bot without needing player reports. Mass actions also occur, but those who barter and trade in illicit programs don&apos;t usually come to the WoW Forums to discuss it. <br>
<br>
There&apos;s a combined effort of normal checks/sweeps that our Hacks team do, the reports that are sent to Game Masters via right-click reporting, and other research on how these programs interact with our games where we attempt to break those methods outright. However, much like real life, the game of &quot;Good Guys vs. Bad Guys&quot; is an ongoing game. We build a mousetrap, they build a better mouse, we improve the mousetrap, etc. We aren&apos;t resting on our laurels, and continue to iterate and build new systems and pull new data to help us find and remove cheaters. <br>
<br>
If you see people exploiting bots/cheats in-game, let us know. You can also email us tips at Hacks@blizzard.com. In-game reports are best as it includes important information that players can&apos;t traditionally see (account details, play behavior information, etc), but where it&apos;s not possible the email is sufficient for us to kick off some research!<br>
<br>
Just to play counterpoint: <br>
<br>
Blizz doesn&apos;t need to &quot;collect info&quot; they have the info for the last 10 years. They could spend what...ten or twenty bucks to buy a bot account and get all that info in minutes. Its a cop out.<br>
This assumption is that bots haven&apos;t evolved in the 11 years we&apos;ve been investigating/breaking them. There are a few botting companies who would strongly disagree with that assessment. Also, reverse-engineering a tool doesn&apos;t happen in minutes, whether you make the purchase or not. Debugging and reverse-engineering takes time, and then building reporting/detection around that also takes additional time. I can certainly understand your frustration, but I want to make sure it&apos;s tempered with realistic expectations. <br>
<br>
Bots and cheat programs will continue to exist in any game for as long as there&apos;s a market for it: unfortunately, players who buy gold or other RMT services encourage botting and compromised accounts whether they realize it or not. People bot for a variety of reasons, from small-scale boredom to organizations who run gold selling services. As long as those exist, we&apos;ll continue to keep weeding out and removing them from the community.<br>
<br>
You are certainly welcome to your opinion, but I won&apos;t let our actions and efforts be dismissed simply because you feel we&apos;re trying to scam or otherwise ignore our playerbase on the issue. Play Nice; Play Fair is one of the 8 core concepts of what we do, and hopefully some day we can convince you of that. <br>
<br>
I wish you well in your adventures, and we&apos;ll continue to clean up bots for if you choose to return. In the meantime, if you do encounter any cheaters in our games I encourage you to use the reporting methods available so we can take a look at them.

Patch Notes<br>
As long as I&apos;ve been at blizzard (4 years) the patch notes haven&apos;t gone live until 6pmish the previous day. this is earlier.<br>
but ultimately, yes, a lot went wrong, which we&apos;re fixing for the 7.2 notes (including PTR notes) (Source (https://twitter.com/devolore/status/818586691510276097))<br>
The light of the tunnel is that part of the issue is due to some team restructuring which means future patch notes will be MUCH better<br>
We generally don&apos;t make promises but I can 100% promise this will not happen again. (Source (https://twitter.com/devolore/status/818692577121603584))<br>
