<br>
Can&apos;t get much about the new arena season in the patch files, will have to wait until the servers are up. <br>
<br>
Seems the Creature\Band\ models got themselves some instruments. According to the sound file named DMF_L70ETC01.mp3, we can assume they will be playing in the Darkmoon Faire<br>
<br>

<br>
Someone sent me these informations about the band by mail. L60ETC on WoWWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Level_60_Elite_Tauren_Chieftain)<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t know if anyone has pointed this out, but the symbol on the drums is &quot;L70ETC,&quot; which stands for Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftain. This is the same band that did the &quot;The Power of the Horde&quot; metal track in WarCraft 3: The Frozen Throne. They were called Level 10 Elite Tauren Chieftain then, and changed their name to Level 60 Elite Tauren Chieftain when WoW came out. They also played Blizzcon the last year it was held.<br>
<br>
Maybe an in-game concert by L70ETC?<br>
<br>
Ezra&apos;s quest (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/june/ezraquest.jpg) is in the patch. (Full story here (http://blogs.ocregister.com/gadgetress/archives/2007/05/wishing_for_war.html) and here (http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/money/article_1702706.php))<br>
