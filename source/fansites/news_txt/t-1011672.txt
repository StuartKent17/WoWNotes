chaud2011-10-30, 09:14 PMPatch 4.3 World Map and Minimap Improvements
The world map and mini-map got a couple of upgrades on test realms and they should be slightly more useful after the patch, hopefully we will see it on live servers soon.



The minimap has an improved menu and will let you track a couple more things, including archaeology and questing areas.
You can now track areas on your minimap, archaeology sites and quest objectives areas will now be displayed directly on the minimap!
The world map now finally shows the level of regions on mouseover.
