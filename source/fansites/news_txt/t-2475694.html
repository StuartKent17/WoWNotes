World of Warcraft Patch 8.6.7 Build 5309<br>
Update Notes WIP DO NOT RELEASE<br>
<br>
April 1, 2019<br>
<br>
Companion App Update: Findr<br>
Find your next tank, healer, or damage dealer at a glance with the latest update to the WoW Companion App: Findr. When you open the Findr feature, you&#x2019;ll be presented with a picture and a brief description of another player, and you can decide whether they&#x2019;d be the right match for your party. Features include:<br>
Glance at a player&#x2019;s gear and achievement points for 3 seconds (maximum) before making a snap judgment about how well they&#x2019;ll tank your Mythic Keystone run.<br>
<br>
Swipe right to request a match and immediately send a party invitation.<br>
Swipe left to completely dismiss the player&#x2019;s entire existence; this is completely anonymous, distancing you from the other player&#x2019;s growing vortex of self-doubt.<br>
Once a match has been made, option to not message them right away, which makes it look like you&#x2019;re super busy and use Findr all the time.<br>
<br>
When the time is right, gather your new groupmates together, and head off to whatever adventures lay in store!<br>
<br>
