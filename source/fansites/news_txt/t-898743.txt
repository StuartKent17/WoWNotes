Boubouille2011-05-05, 02:39 AMPatch 4.2 Models - Bosses and Mounts!
Patch 4.2 added a fair amount of models to the game files, see the newest ones below!

PvP Mounts
Both Horde and Alliance got brand new PvP mounts, they seem to be a reward from the existing rated battlegrounds achievements. It's not very clear which achievement is required, Blizzard is probably still playing around with those:



Veteran of the Horde http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5325/veteran-of-the-horde/#13914/14002 Win 100 rated battlegrounds.
Warbringer of the Horde http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5326/warbringer-of-the-horde/#13914/14002 Win 300 rated battlegrounds.
Veteran of the Alliance http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5328/veteran-of-the-alliance/#13914/14002 Win 100 rated battlegrounds.
Warbound Veteran of the Alliance http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5329/warbound-veteran-of-the-alliance/#13914/14002 Win 300 rated battlegrounds.

Tarecgosa and Tarecgosa Whelp
Tarecgosa, the blue drake from the legendary staff questline got her own model. There's also a model named "TarecgosaWhelp" and I really want to believe that it is the Dragonwrath Whelpling http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71033/dragonwrath-whelpling/ rewarded by Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest - Guild Edition http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5840/dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest-guild-edition/#13914/14002. There is no indication in the game files yet that it is indeed the reward, I will try to confirm that as soon as possible.

Lord Anthrycist - Lava Form
It looks like Lord Anthrycist's fight will have two phases, he's much more fiery in one of those.

Two sets of Lava Spiders models have been added in this patch and they look awesome.

Fire Elemental - Kar
A new Fire Elemental "Kar" model appeared in this patch, not sure if it's just an updated trash mob model or a boss.

Ragnaros Revamped
Ragnaros has been slightly revamped and looks a lot less stupid than in the Patch 4.1 game files.
