Players upgrading from World of Warcraft Starter Edition must wait for trial restrictions to be removed up to 72 hours before using character boost.

Epic Pantheon Trinket and RNG
I mean at this point a 5 year old could think of a better loot system
I'd be eager to hear your suggestions on how it could be better. I mean, the existing one has functioned pretty well for the past 13 years for WoW specifically and for the past 20 years across an entire genre of games other genres too, but you get my point.

Now I am getting upgrade drops and no trinket to put them on no offspec, so I have to begrudgingly delete them. 
I've gotten my mainspec and I've just been saving them for when I finally get an offspec. I luckily don't need anything else off Argus so I just do him primarily in an offspec loot now. 

I think overall RNG works well in games if it isn't taken too far, perhaps people are just a little over it this expansion seeing as its been put into just about every aspect of the game to drag out played time?
I think that's a fair take on it but its a little silly when its being applied to something that really has never changed. There have always been bosses through the years that have had a powerful trinket on their drop table that everyone wants. I immediately think of Death's Verdict and how frustrating it was for me to get one but that's kinda how drops and loot tables work. 

Items don't always drop and you're not always guaranteed to get them, things like trinkets are meant to be rare because they generally make a pretty big impact when you do finally get one. The concept of loot in an RPG has this at its very core. 

At this point there have been 15 total resets since Antorus opened. 15 total chances to kill Argus and receive a Pantheon trinket. Its not that unheard of to still be looking for an item off of him even if you killed him each of those 15 resets. While its a personal loot drop and its slightly different, it still functions the same way and its still meant to be rare. Its something that not everyone will get, much like previous expansions when it comes to coveted items like trinkets and legendaries.

Pantheon's Blessings should drop at 2-3x the normal rate once you have a trinket at 1,000.
That could be a pretty good suggestion, however I think it might not be a good experience for someone that doesn't have one at all to see someone that gets one get rewarded even more.

Just a heads up I'm deleting the posts coming in that are off topic as clearly people aren't reading the previous posts. For those that are hopping in, this discussion is about the Epic Pantheon trinkets, this is not about Aman'Thul's or any of the other Legion Legendaries. I'd like to not lock this thread as its actually been pretty productive and there's been some good posts.

Wow.. you've deleted my post twice. I wasn't offensive. I was making a correction to the blue's post. The blue said in its post that the legendary system for the Pantheon trinket is the very same system that's been in the game for 13 years. I broke down the leggo system in each of the previous expansions highlighting how they all differed and it was nixxed. I reposted taking care to be extra polite and it was also nixxed.
This thread is not discussing the Legendary systems in other expansions nor even the legendary trinket off Argus. I've said that twice and said why I was deleting off topic replies that don't apply to the Epic Pantheon Trinkets because that's not what is being discussed. Sorry for the confusion but I would recommend reading all of the replies before jumping in a thread especially the blue ones since you can jump through them.
