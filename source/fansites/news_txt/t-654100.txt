Just like any major update, patch 3.2 will introduce its share of new weapon models. The Coliseum Aliance/Horde models will be used in the Argent Tournament and the Argent Coliseum instances, the PvP 3.2.0 items will most likely be rewarded in future arena seasons. 

As usual the screenshots are only available in high-definition, sorry for the few people out there who still struggle with a 15" screen.
