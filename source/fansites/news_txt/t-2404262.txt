With every expansion, our musical mages reach deep down into their souls and summon a tableau of sound to accompany your next adventure. Building upon a variety of musical themes from World of Warcraft over the years, composer Glenn Stafford has infused his magic into the new main title for Battle for Azeroth, “Before the Storm.” Sit back, relax, and let the music carry you into the heart of Azeroth.
