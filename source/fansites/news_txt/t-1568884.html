Warlords of Draenor - Garrison Stables<br>
One of the buildings you can put on a large plot in your garrison is the Stables (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/65-stables#related:buildings). The stables will show off mounts that you have set as favorite mounts, allowing them to wander around to different stacks of hay.<br>
<br>
There are five other buildings (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/65-stables#related:same-plot) that can go in large plots, with a total of two plots available at garrison level 3. As with every other building, there are three building tiers, which give these bonuses: <br>
<br>
<br>
Tier 1 - Enables the capture and training of special mounts on Draenor.<br>
Tier 2 - You may remain mounted while interacting with objects in outdoor Draenor zones.<br>
Tier 3 - Increases mount speed in Draenor by 20%.<br>
