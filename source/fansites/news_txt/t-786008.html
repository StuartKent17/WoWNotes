It&apos;s been a long time since the last major change on the site, the current theme is now 3 years old and it&apos;s time to replace it with something a little nicer and a lot more useful! The new website has a couple of interesting additions that should make your life easier. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A feed of the latest Blue Posts is finally available on the front page! <br>
The left menu is gone, news posts can now use the full width of the page. It will mostly allows me to post more information when I have to use tables, lot of pictures, etc ... <br>
Patch menus have been moved to the top right of the site. <br>
The forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forum.php) are much, much, much, much better. You can now go through a couple of posts <br>
Overall, the site is much nicer and is a lot more polished than the previous theme. <br>

Now that the Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com) is integrated to the website, we also updated it to match the new theme and added a couple of features.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Support of Battle.net forums in the future, we shouldn&apos;t have any downtime when the new WoW site is launched.<br>
Support of Spanish (http://newblue.mmo-champion.com/?language=es) and French (http://newblue.mmo-champion.com/?language=fr) language.<br>
Addition of boxes with Recent News and Recent Forum posts from MMO-Champion.<br>
Cleaned up categories, you can now click the name of a Blue Poster for his post history, etc ...<br>
