Patch 7.2 Hotfixes - April 4<br>
Broken Shore<br>
<br>
Our Valarjar allies have deployed grapple points in key locations on Broken Shore.<br>
Broken Shore Rare Elite icons will now appear on the Broken Shore map even when the player is not currently in the Broken Shore.<br>
Creatures other than Rare Elites and Sentinax Lieutenants no longer drop Nethershards for players who are in a raid group.<br>
Rare Elites now fewer Sentinax Beacons.<br>
Portal enemies should now drop their beacon type much more often.<br>
Sentinax Lieutenants should drop multiple beacons for every player, allowing a quick restart after the break.<br>
Sentinax Lieutenants now drop many more Nethershards when slain.<br>
Sentinax cool-down time lowered to 3 minutes (was 5 minutes).<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: These changes are aimed at aligning the pacing of the Sentinax area without significantly changing the rewards. Upgraded portals should feel more special, portal beacons more scarce, and the final boss for each round of Sentinax activity should be a more welcome sight. Since tapping rules and behaviors of large raids of players don&#x2019;t present a good experience for nearby parties of five or fewer, and especially solo players who might come along, the change to drops for raid groups is intended to allow everyone more opportunities to tap enemies.<br>
