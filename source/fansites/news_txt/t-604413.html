General<br>
Some players may notice improved data load times when newly entering the world and after zoning into new areas.<br>
Character/NPC load times have been decreased, and now should appear faster. You&#x2019;re not hearing voices, there really are people in Shattrath!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Bug Fixes<br>
Felspine the Greater in Shadowmoon Valley will no longer evade when engaged.<br>
Guttripper in Nagrand will no longer evade when engaged.<br>
Players will now be correctly credited with their arena points if they purchase an arena item during weekly arena calculations.<br>
Using a castsequence macro on a target moving out of range will no longer cause it to stop working. <br>

WoW PaperIdol Beta<br>
We&apos;ve got another &quot;model viewer&quot; link today, this one is a very early beta and you might want to contribute to the project if you&apos;ve got a few good ideas when it comes to designing signatures and things like that. <br>
<br>
By going on http://www.grumpycoder.net/signatures/generate.html (http://www.grumpycoder.net/signatures/generate.html) you will be able to create a signature and an avatar based on your in game character model, however there are a few restrictions :<br>
Your face/hair style/hair color/facial hair style can&apos;t be gathered from your armory profile, and you&apos;ll have to use the &quot;Customization&quot; sub menu if you want the avatar to exactly match your ingame character.<br>
Same problem with the hide helm/cloak. (It will probably be added to the customization menu soon)<br>
It&apos;s an early beta, you can only get a very basic avatar or signature for the moment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It seems that it was released a few days ago, and I figured out it might be a good idea to give it some support because we could definitely get something nice for the community out of this. If you&apos;ve got any feedback or suggestion related to this tool please use Grumpycoder.net forums (http://forum.grumpycoder.net/index.php/board,1.0.html)<br>
<br>
Your signature/avatar will be available through a link that look like : http&amp;#58;//grumpycoder.net/signatures/**************************/signature.jpg (avatar.jpg for the avatar, obviously). If for some reason there is something bugged with it you can replace avatar.jpg/signature.jpg with taint.txt to manually refresh your character data. <br>
<br>
Example : (This is obviously not my character, but I&apos;m not popular enough to post a green-geared character and look cool)<br>
