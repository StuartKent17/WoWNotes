<br>

<br>
FAQ<br>
<br>
Q. My realm needs connecting, why isn&#x2019;t it listed?<br>
A. The connections listed are the phases we&#x2019;ve currently finalized and have planned connection dates or estimates available for. Additional connections are possible, but they just haven&#x2019;t reached that stage yet. We&#x2019;ll be updating the realm connection list as phases complete and new phases are planned.<br>
<br>
Q. When will my realm be connected?<br>
A. We&apos;ll update this thread with the latest information on currently planned phases.<br>
<br>
Q. My realm has a lower population than those on the list, why isn&#x2019;t mine being connected first?<br>
A. Realm connections are based on a number of factors including population, faction balance, the realm&#x2019;s physical location in the world compared to other realms it may be connected to, among others. It&#x2019;s also worth noting that websites which attempt to track population, while helpful in many ways, are estimates based on public data which may not provide the clearest picture of actual population.<br>

Warlords of Draenor Stats<br>
With Crit being on gear much more often in WOD are there any plans for making Crit better for Elemental with no reforging?<br>
A) Where did you get that Crit will be on gear much more often? B) We&apos;re considering some changes, but nothing to announce yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408789920098971648))<br>
<br>
Will tertiary stats appear on PvP gear in WoD? Sockets etc. are supposed to appear randomly, though, so...<br>
We&apos;re talking about it still. If PvP gear doesn&apos;t have it, then PvE gear becomes better by default. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/410518050819936257))<br>
Wish we could chose our tertiary stats on PvP gear, kinda like reforging but for 100% value...<br>
Keep in mind that tertiary stats are intended to be very rare. So, whatever the PvP design, the rarity would match PvE. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/410566262138208256))<br>
<br>
What about removing Spirit and let Haste be the main factor of mana regen? Throwing ideas around. @Celestalon<br>
Spirit&apos;s value varies significantly between classes. One contributor is what the other secondaries do for regen. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409907822252412928))<br>
We&apos;re looking at potential changes in that regard, to standardize that better between classes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409907928208916480))<br>
<br>
What will you do with hit, exp etc in 6.0? Convert to other stats or just remove them?<br>
Convert them to other stats. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/415959639373524992))<br>
What about Spirit? On clothes? On Jewelry? Some DPS casters are using them on rings/neck at least.<br>
No spirit on armor may involve increasing the amount of spirit on non-armor. That makes it more complex to change existing armor. We recognize the problem and are planning potential solutions, but aren&apos;t ready to give specifics yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416680961342857216))<br>
Wouldn&apos;t increasing the amount of regen spirit gives instead avoid that issue?<br>
That may be part of it, but we may change how we itemize non-armor pieces. Just complicates the issue. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416698025877065728))<br>
If healers have enough regen with 1-2 spirit pieces in first raid tier, what happens to mana regen later on?<br>
&quot;Enough&quot; is a very ethereal concept. It also varies with other gear. And definitely not from 1-2 items in the first tier. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416860892853047297))<br>
Then between 3 and 6 (of 7) slots. If item stats triple again, will only need max 2 spirit pieces in final tier. Also, sockets.<br>
Sounds like you&apos;re ignoring the fact that &quot;enough&quot; changes between tiers. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417078989790789633))<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor PvE<br>
... or the difference between LFR/normal/hc/mythic could also be a tad lower, like 10 itemlevels instead of the current 13.<br>
A larger gap between tiers allows us to have bosses that test performance more. It also makes upgrades &quot;feel&quot; noticeable. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410886682435543040))<br>
<br>
you know how battle rez will work in normal/heroic? 3 regardless of size like current flex?<br>
We&apos;re investigating some possible solutions. We want to make it scale by size, but know that breakpoints are not the answer. It ... (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416689659150741504))<br>
... may be an opportunity to solve some other problems with the system, like # available being hidden, and the # being the same ... (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416690207019110400))<br>
... on short vs long fights. We don&apos;t have details to share yet, but those are concerns we&apos;re thinking about. May not fix all those (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416690586876268545))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Why not go GW2 sPvP style? They made it all skill based and still rewarding. Cooler looking gear as you progress.<br>
The Trial of the Gladiator is our plan for a &quot;gearless&quot; PvP ecosystem. 0% chance we&apos;re removing gear in PvP overall. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417394936510574592))<br>
<br>
Any chance PvP trinket will have a unique sound in the near future?<br>
Excellent idea. Thanks for pointing it out. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417150092844339201))<br>
Definitely a great idea!<br>
Well, the proper authorities have been notified! (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417241995300466688))<br>
<br>
ok death grip bugs on tolviron and shado pan for over a year now 100% chance when target is next to a wall. Why are you ignoring it<br>
We&apos;ll have to follow up on it. It requires geometry and collision work. We&apos;ve discussed it before. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417154026115854338))<br>
<br>
Please encourage pvp participation in random bgs with CP, 100 when you win and 50 when you lose. I hate Arenas and Rbgs.<br>
I could see doing something similar to what we do in RBGs (base on final score). Would have to give it more thought. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417153763955077123))<br>
<br>
winning one awarded 5,6 or 7, losing takes you 14<br>
Aware of MMR issues. We&apos;ve been doing some work on the system but it isn&apos;t appropriate to roll it out mid season. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/416583868276551680))<br>
