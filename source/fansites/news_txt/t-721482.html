Earthfury Epaulets (T1 Shaman) in Molten Core<br>
Unfortunately you will have to wait for the fix to the Baron&apos;s loot table to get a pair of those Earthfury Epaulets. The good news is the Eye of Sulfuras is still on Ragnaros&apos; loot table, so it is possible to receive this item. <br>
<br>
[...] It&apos;ll get fixed in a future patch. Unfortunately I can&apos;t really say when =(. The fix should be in the patch notes and if it isn&apos;t, I&apos;ll update this thread. Sorry for the inconvenience. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25134713303/earthfury-epaulets-unobtainable/))<br>

Psychic Horror / Anti Magic Shield<br>
We looked into this is and it is intended. Psychic Horror was changed so that the disarm effect still occurs regardless of whether the target is immune to the fear portion. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25026406031/psychic-horror-disarms-in-ams/))<br>

Retribution in Cataclysm (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25026405663/will-divine-storm-remain-the-51-point-talent/))<br>
There are a few basic way classes choose what attack to use next. Some classes are limited by resources. If a rogue has 60 energy, she can choose to spend it on attack A or attack B. If attack A hits harder and attack B doesn&apos;t have situational utility, then she&apos;ll use A every time.<br>
<br>
A warlock generally isn&apos;t limited by mana within short time scales. A lock&apos;s decisions are more rotational. You want to cast A before you cast B. It&apos;s not that B is bad, just that it becomes more powerful if you do A first. For example, there is little point in casting your first Corruption seconds before the target is about to die.<br>
<br>
Paladins have a third model, one more based on prioritization. You aren&apos;t generally limited by mana, and you don&apos;t generally need to do things in a certain order for the mechanics to work, but you do have attacks that you&apos;d rather use when they are available (generally because they hit harder). The decision point comes in because you have a lot of cooldowns, so you can&apos;t just spam your hardest hitting attack over and over again. When your Judgements and Hammer and Crusader Strike are on cooldown, then your choice is probably Divine Storm. (Depending on your gear, DS might even trump CS.) If Divine Storm&apos;s damage went down, then you might prioritize Consecration or Exorcism higher, but you can&apos;t spam those either, so then you&apos;re back to Divine Storm or autoattack. That was my point.<br>
<br>
There are things we can do as well to make Divine Storm better at single targets without making it overpowered against groups of targets. Off the top of my head, there are mechanics like the meteor where the damage is divided among the targets. What we are trying to chill out on the warrior, paladin and DK particularly is the &quot;free AE&quot; component. When your AE attacks are balanced against single targets (in the absence of some mechanic like I was suggesting above) then you just get free damage when you can AE as well. This means those classes leap dramatically ahead on meters whenever they are in a situation where they can &quot;cleave.&quot; It also means they aren&apos;t doing anything very differently when faced with groups of mobs over single targets. By contrast the mage might switch to Blizzard or Living Bomb and the rogue has to start using Fan of Knives.<br>
<br>
One of the ways we can support more individual abilities on classes is by making them situational. If you use all of your attacks no matter what the situation, then your gameplay tends to get very formulaic and eventually boring. It is also likely to get really complicated if your whole action bar is part of your standard rotation. A better design, we think, is that some abilities get used in AE situations and some get used in single-target situations. There can be overlap, but we&apos;d at least like players to assess the upcoming battle and make some decisions about how to approach it before just going into a tunnel vision button-hitting mode. <br>
<br>
Solution: Make CS baseline, put a 1 point 10% dmg to CS buff in its place in the talent tree to replace it.<br>
That is not an announced change. I can understand the frustration of being in a gray area at the moment where you know some information that we have released but much of the details are still under NDA. Unfortunately, if you focus on little tidbits that someone leaked or speculated, then you aren&apos;t going to get the full story. In cases like this we had to put something in the talent tree as temporary filler when we pulled CS. Many of the talent trees have talents that say NYI or just plain don&apos;t do anything. That&apos;s just where we are in the alpha process. If we push data at a stage when someone can&apos;t even talent down a tree then the spec becomes unplayable. As such, we have to make talent tree changes in large chunks at once. <br>
<br>
GC - &quot;We are nerfing Divine Storm against single targets because we don&apos;t want AoE abilities to be used against single targets, but we fully expect Divine Storm to continue to be used against single targets.&quot;<br>
More accurate to say that we don&apos;t want single target abilities to get free bonus damage when in groups. That&apos;s not balance-able. For the warrior the solution is to make Whirlwind not cost-effective against single-targets. For the DK, it&apos;s about getting Pestilence back towards a utility role (getting diseases up on groups) and not a massive AE attack. For the paladin, we still want them to use Divine Storm (and you can&apos;t cost-effect a Ret paladin anyway) so the solution will have to be something different. <br>
<br>
How about something like having Crusader Strike apply some kind of debuff to the target . Then have Divine Storm hit anyone with that debuff harder. I think that would get its damage up on single targets but keep it lower on groups.<br>
Yep, both this and the tie-in to Judgements are good ideas. We also like the T102P bonus. <br>
