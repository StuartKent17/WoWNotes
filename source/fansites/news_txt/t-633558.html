I didn&apos;t report the Arena Matchmaking System FAQ (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/14910422788-arena-matchmaking-system-faq.html) on the front page yesterday, but Kalgan made a very interesting reply here. Below are the rating requirements for Season 6 gear, also note that a new Archavon boss will be added. There isn&apos;t any ETA for Season 6 for the moment, most likely patch 3.1.0 release date + a few weeks/months. <br>

<br>
There&apos;s still plenty of room for some items to be pretty hard to get without causing most players to be left out of good gear. As I mentioned earlier, with the start of the next season we expect new teams and personal ratings to start much lower than they have before (not 1500). That way, everyone&apos;s experience is to climb toward the rating they&apos;re successfully playing at. So, knowing that, here&apos;s what our current thinking is on rating requirements for season 6.<br>
<br>
Disclaimer: all of this is subject to change!<br>
<br>
Other notes/caveats:<br>
Items with no rating listed would have no rating requirement<br>
It won&apos;t be quite as easy to get deadly items via emblems of conquest as hateful items currently are via emblems of valor<br>
The new Archavon boss (a new boss located in another wing of the Vault of Archavon), will have slightly different drops than the current Archavon (he can drop Furious Gloves/Legs, or any possible random honor item in addition to tier 8 pve set items similar to Archavon&apos;s t7 pve set drops, but cannot drop the Furious Chest piece)<br>
Honor/Arena costs aren&apos;t listed but Hateful costs would be similar to current Savage, Deadly costs similar to current Hateful, and Furious costs would be similar to current Deadly<br>
You might note that the Furious weapon is still at a high requirement, 2k, the thinking being that most players are encouraged to get their weapon upgrade through pve, although hardcore arena competitors have an outlet to get an equivalent weapon through arenas (if you&apos;re hardcore enough for 2k, you can forego raiding for a weapon)<br>
Additional note, &quot;deadly trinket&quot; refers to the current battlemaster&apos;s trinkets, &quot;furious trinket&quot; refers to an upgraded medallion of the alliance/horde<br>
