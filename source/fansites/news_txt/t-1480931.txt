Warlords of Draenor PvP
There is one stat on gear which increases your character's health, while every single other stat increases your damage.
You guys halved the Stam budget when we moved from Vanilla to TBC to help combat a deteriorating damage to health pool ratio. Maybe it's simply time to do that again, possibly drop the budget even more than half. 

That's exactly what I meant when I said we'd be increasing the effectiveness of Stamina. You will get significantly more health per point. I don't have the exact amount per point handy, but the jist of it is that the Stamina on your gear will be enough to increase your health pool at roughly the same rate that everything else increases your damage/healing output.

As well there should be massive differences between people in green and people in conquest. What the heck is the point, and what motivation would people have to actually get pvp gear when greens are just as good.
There are shades of grey here. Of course, someone who is fully kitted out in Conquest gear should have no issue taking out someone whose first action at level 100 was to queue for a battleground. Building up and improving your character is an important part of World of Warcraft gameplay, including in PvP, and we have no intention of changing that.

However, the player who immediately queues for a battleground at level 100 is probably pretty excited to get into PvP, and it's heartbreaking to suddenly find out that you're not just disadvantaged, you're completely ineffective. The level 100 shouldn't be on equal footing with players that have spent time and effort gearing up, but they also shouldn't feel like they can't contribute to their team's success -- and their teammates shouldn't feel like they're essentially down a player.

A fresh 100 should absolutely, categorically, 100% be completely aware that they're going to need better gear to go toe to toe with the big cats, but they shouldn't feel like litter in the meantime. Follow?

Will tanks have that chance completely removed by selecting tank spec?
Yes. Tanks get -3% chance to be parried. Could still be parried by a +4, technically, if you're fighting something underlevel Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439835599957024768
â€œCould still be parried by a +4, technically, if you're fighting something underlevel" Will level ?? bosses still be +3?
Yes, bosses count as YourLevel+3. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439934742381617152

How will the final tick for HoTs be calculated? Is it average tickspeed, base tickspeed, or tickspeed when the hot drops of?
Tick speed period for the last full tick. Haste is recalculated on every tick. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441344564280819712
If not then it will still be valuable to be slightly above breakpoints for the smallest possible extra tick dmg
Won't matter if you don't let your DoTs fall off. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441354467087101953

i am excited for the healing changes. Looking forward to not having millions and millions of overhealing as a monk.
Yeah... Wasn't it cool when overhealing was regarded as a bad thing? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442168008828395522

Do you think limiting mobility on healers will make fights less complex and fun? Blade Lord and Durumu would be much harder.
Absolutely. Content is tailored the abilities of classes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442180269429100545

How will the new smart healing work? Your HST totem healing the guy at 90% instead of the one at 10% will be really frustrating
We want and you should want *you* to heal the guy at 10%. We want *you* to feel like the hero, not your smart healing totem. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442227425699573760

Overall, healers dont like crit, usually just ends up overhealing. But true for the rest.
Great example of the problem. If your allies spend more time between 0% and 100%, then it won't usually be overhealing. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442251793032941568

Why are you removing the low cost basic heal and leave two high cost basic heals? Shouldn't 1 high cost be removed instead?
The cost isn't really what matters; the efficiency is. We're leaving one high throughput, one high efficiency. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442254959782793216

Character / Items
Slight change in topic: plans to nerf Heroic Garrosh mount chance? If so, pre-patch 6.0 or WoD release?
Yep, same as Invincible and such, will go to a low % chance, but not before WoD release. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/442360365590913024

Will the Pandaren Phoenix mounts become account wide after Pandaren Challenge Modes end?
Not currently planned. They're being treated like PvP mounts. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/442707785533247489

Warlords of Draenor Stats
Character progression is one of the hallmarks of any role-playing game, so we're nerfing you 30 levels trust us it's better.
It's telling that many most? people who played at Blizzcon didn't even notice the squish. It's really not a big deal. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439287654618656768

IE we'll get a spike during WoD, but then before 7.0 everything will scale down to be inline with others, then ramp
May repeat the process eventually, but this squish buys a fair bit of time. Don't view it as an every xpac thing. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439394214615347200
Who can we blame for pushing a squish instead of doing the right thing and updating the codebase with long ints?
You can blame me if you like. It's a design call, not a technical one. We don't want to see +13759 Strength helms. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439535572416081920
so it was a lie when they told us it was a technical limitation. Great. Stay classy blizzard developers.
Designers aren't programmers, and not every inaccurate statement is a lie. It WAS a technical hurdle, but not insurmountable WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439556814506434560

Proving Grounds
Random idea: What about PG Silver rewarding the entry level blue weapon that we've gotten from e.g. Crucible of Carnage before?
That idea came up internally the other day: possibly a one-time quest for getting Bronze at 100. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439076242579390464

PvP
I may be missing it somewhere but is Ashran going to be instanced or something like the TI where you fly to and boom in the action?
It will use some new tech. It is instanced but you won't feel the transition no load screen. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/441457354811256832

I can queue as a tank and finish a 5-man in 10 minutes for a near-guaranteed 250 honor. BG takes that just to get in, no guarantee.
A combination of high JP rewards and a well-intentioned but easily abused currency conversion. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/442808730589999105
We could easily have turned off the conversion long ago but trying not to be mean. Perhaps we should. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/442809102989676544
