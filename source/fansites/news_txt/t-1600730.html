After many grueling bouts in the Arenas and Battlegrounds, the time has nearly come to see who will reign supreme in this action-packed PvP season. Prepare to fight your last battles, and remember&#x2014;to the victors go the spoils!<br>
<br>
Arena and Rated Battleground Season 15 will be coming to an end in a couple of weeks. Once the season wraps, we&apos;ll begin an approximately two week process to determine end-of-season reward eligibility.<br>
<br>
Qualified players should note the following in order to ensure you receive your just rewards:<br>
<br>
<br>
Please refrain from transferring your characters to another realm or faction until after PvP Season 15 has ended.<br>
PvP Season 15 titles and mounts will be awarded approximately two weeks after the season ends.<br>
<br>
<br>
Conquest Points will be converted to Honor Points at the end of the season, and any Honor above 4,000 will be converted to in-game currency at a rate of 35 silver per point. A few other things to keep in mind once the season has ended:<br>
<br>
<br>
The Honor cap will remain at 4,000.<br>
Season 15 items with rating requirements will no longer be available for purchase.<br>
Rated Battleground and Arena matches will not be available during the break between seasons.<br>
<br>
<br>
Best of luck, gladiators!</div></div>
