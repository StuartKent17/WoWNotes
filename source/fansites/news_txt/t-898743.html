Patch 4.2 added a fair amount of models to the game files, see the newest ones below!<br>
<br>
PvP Mounts<br>
Both Horde and Alliance got brand new PvP mounts, they seem to be a reward from the existing rated battlegrounds achievements. It&apos;s not very clear which achievement is required, Blizzard is probably still playing around with those:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Veteran of the Horde (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5325/veteran-of-the-horde/#13914/14002) Win 100 rated battlegrounds.<br>
Warbringer of the Horde (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5326/warbringer-of-the-horde/#13914/14002) Win 300 rated battlegrounds.<br>
Veteran of the Alliance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5328/veteran-of-the-alliance/#13914/14002) Win 100 rated battlegrounds.<br>
Warbound Veteran of the Alliance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5329/warbound-veteran-of-the-alliance/#13914/14002) Win 300 rated battlegrounds.<br>

<br>
<br>
Tarecgosa and Tarecgosa Whelp<br>
Tarecgosa, the blue drake from the legendary staff questline got her own model. There&apos;s also a model named &quot;TarecgosaWhelp&quot; and I really want to believe that it is the Dragonwrath Whelpling (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71033/dragonwrath-whelpling/) rewarded by Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa&apos;s Rest - Guild Edition (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5840/dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest-guild-edition/#13914/14002). There is no indication in the game files yet that it is indeed the reward, I will try to confirm that as soon as possible.<br>

<br>
<br>
Malorne<br>
Malorne (http://www.wowpedia.org/Malorne) is also in the game files and got a pretty nice model. For more information check Malorne on Wowpedia (http://www.wowpedia.org/Malorne)<br>

<br>
<br>
Fandral Staghelm + Fire Scorpion<br>
Fandral&apos;s model and his Fire Scorpion forms have been added. <br>

<br>
<br>
Lord Anthrycist - Lava Form<br>
It looks like Lord Anthrycist&apos;s fight will have two phases, he&apos;s much more fiery in one of those. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Lava Spiders<br>
Two sets of Lava Spiders models have been added in this patch and they look awesome.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Winged Lion Pet<br>
Yes. Seriously. So much cuteness. <br>

<br>
<br>
Fire Elemental - Kar<br>
A new Fire Elemental &quot;Kar&quot; model appeared in this patch, not sure if it&apos;s just an updated trash mob model or a boss.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Ragnaros Revamped<br>
Ragnaros has been slightly revamped and looks a lot less stupid than in the Patch 4.1 game files. <br>
