Boubouille2009-07-30, 10:41 AMPatch 3.2 - PTR Build 10170
A new PTR build was deployed during the night, there wasn't any change to player skills / talents or achievements, only a lot of bug fixes. 


Patch 3.2 - Where can I get Epic Gems?
The patch will probably hit the live servers very soon and a lot of people ask me the same question : Where can I get the Epic Gems? It shouldn't be hard to answer that, currently there are 4 ways to get them :

Jewelcrafting / Prospecting
You can find epic gems by prospecting Titanium Ore , it's probably not the best way to get it because Titanium is already fairly expensive but if you need as many gems as possible and don't want to wait, go for it. Prospecting Titanium will give you an epic gem 25~30% of the time, the droprate for rare gems seems to be the same, and you will always get an uncommon gem. If you're lucky enough you can even get 2 epics on the same prospect. 

Note: You will also get Titanium Powder  60% of the time, you can exchange 10 of them for a Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token  and get your new recipes even faster. 

Alchemy
New transmutations are available for these gems. 20 Hours cooldown

Transmute: Ametrine 
Transmute: Cardinal Ruby 
Transmute: Dreadstone 
Transmute: Eye of Zul 
Transmute: King's Amber 
Transmute: Majestic Zircon 

PvE - Emblems of Heroism
You can buy any of the epic gems for Emblem of Heroism  These emblems do not drop anymore in 3.2 and are replaced by Emblems of Conquest in heroic instances / raids dungeons but you can still exchange higher tier emblems. Emblem of Conquest  -> Emblem of Valor  > Emblem of Heroism 

[color=#A335EE] Cardinal Ruby , [color=#A335EE] Majestic Zircon , [color=#A335EE] King's Amber  can be bought for Emblem of Heroism  x 20.
[color=#A335EE] Ametrine , [color=#A335EE] Dreadstone , [color=#A335EE] Eye of Zul  can be bought for Emblem of Heroism  x 10.

PvP - Honor
Last but not least, you can buy any of the epic gem for 10,000 Honor Points
