Boubouille2009-07-30, 10:41 AMPatch 3.2 - PTR Build 10170
A new PTR build was deployed during the night, there wasn't any change to player skills / talents or achievements, only a lot of bug fixes. 


Patch 3.2 - Where can I get Epic Gems?
The patch will probably hit the live servers very soon and a lot of people ask me the same question : Where can I get the Epic Gems? It shouldn't be hard to answer that, currently there are 4 ways to get them :

Jewelcrafting / Prospecting
You can find epic gems by prospecting Titanium Ore http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36910/titanium-ore/, it's probably not the best way to get it because Titanium is already fairly expensive but if you need as many gems as possible and don't want to wait, go for it. Prospecting Titanium will give you an epic gem 25~30% of the time, the droprate for rare gems seems to be the same, and you will always get an uncommon gem. If you're lucky enough you can even get 2 epics on the same prospect. 

Note: You will also get Titanium Powder http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46849/titanium-powder/ 60% of the time, you can exchange 10 of them for a Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/41596/dalaran-jewelcrafters-token/ and get your new recipes even faster. 

Alchemy
New transmutations are available for these gems. 20 Hours cooldown

PvE - Emblems of Heroism
You can buy any of the epic gems for Emblem of Heroism http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40752/emblem-of-heroism/.
