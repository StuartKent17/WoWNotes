We are trying to make haste a slightly more attractive stat for classes that utilize a lot of damage or healing over time spells, specifically Shadow priests, warlocks (though especially Affliction) and Resto druids. We realize other classes use hots and dots too, but I think we can all agree that it&apos;s a bigger problem for the ones I mentioned.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m going to share with you an idea that the class and item designers came up with for 3.3. This is a work in progress so it&apos;s possible we&apos;ll end up going a different way after we see how it plays. However I also wanted to explain our logic here in case it wasn&apos;t obvious.<br>
<br>
We have new tech that will allow specific hots and dots to tick faster -- the time between ticks would decrease. This means more damage or healing per time but also having to refresh those spells more often. Since there is a trade-off, we&apos;re not sure the change is a no-brainer, especially in the healing case.<br>
<br>
Because of this, we are planning on introducing the concept through glyphs. Glyphs represent a great test bed for new ideas because they are easier to change (and easier on the players when we do change them) compared to core spell functions or even talents. If we like the way it feels and players like the way it feels and the glyphs prove popular or fun, then this may be the kind of thing that shifts from glyphs over time -- not unlike the way some favorite set bonuses eventually become talents.<br>
<br>
For 3.3 we are talking about introducing three new glyphs for Shadow Word: Pain, Corruption and Rejuvenation that would allow these spells to tick faster with the more haste you have. There are glyphs of Corruption and Rejuv already, and we&apos;re not sure how we&apos;re going to resolve those yet. For Shadow Word: Pain, we are likely to rename the current glyph to Glyph of Mind Flay, remove the old Glyph of Mind Flay, and increase Mind Flay by 10 yards in the base spell.<br>
<br>
Again, these are not promises (nor ponies). For a variety of reasons, you may see these changes on the PTR or you may not. If you do see any or all of the three glyphs implemented however, we wanted you to have some idea of what we were trying to do. Feedback is certainly appreciated, especially if you get to try them out. <br>

Emblems of Triumphs in 3.3<br>
General reminder: Things can still change.<br>
<br>
The current plan is to make Emblems of Triumph the &quot;base&quot; of emblems so everything that drops Emblems of Conquest would be changed to Triumph and then the new raid content would drop the new highest emblem along with things like the heroic daily and such. <br>
<br>
Icecrown Citadel - Hard Mode &quot;Switch&quot;<br>
Assuming everything goes as planned, you can switch it back and forth as much as you like. Encounter 1 on hard, 2 on normal, 3 on hard, 4 on normal, etc.<br>
<br>
In effect it works out similar to Ulduar but it&apos;s with a much more clear method in the UI as opposed to the fairly confusing process of figuring out some encounter mechanics just to activate it. <br>
<br>
Ulduar Change - Thorim disconnect<br>
We&apos;ve made some changes to the Thorim encounter in Ulduar to reduce the amount of information sent when you initially start the fight. This should reduce the amount of lag and disconnects that some players experience when starting the encounter.<br>
<br>
If you have completed the Thorim encounter after today (10/6) and are still experiencing issues when engaging the mobs in the arena, please post in this thread.<br>
<br>
Please keep this thread on topic, and only post if you are still experiencing disconnects during the Thorim encounter. <br>

Headless Horseman in 2009<br>
I posted this a while back, but he is indeed level 80. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20143782248-headless-horseman-2009-lvl-70-or-80.html))<br>

Missing brewfest coins<br>
There has been a change to the way holiday tokens and items work. If an item&apos;s tooltip says it requires that holiday, that means it will remain as long as the holiday is up and will automatically disappear from your inventory when the holiday ends. That tokens are included in this is intended.<br>
<br>
Remember that your in-game calendar will tell you the precise time when the holidays begin and end in server time, so if you&apos;re uncertain if you&apos;re going to have enough time to complete things in the future, make sure to check your calendar. <br>
<br>
[...] We have no plans to restore the coins. The coins going away was something that happened last year as well, and it was not a bug then, either.<br>
<br>
If you&apos;re looking to get the meta achievement, it does not require you to spend every day doing the dailies, or even half the days of the event. Yes, it will require some dedication, but if you do not have the time to spend to get all the achievements in one year, that&apos;s perfectly understandable; the holiday will be there next year, and you can focus on different goals.

Argent Tournament and Faction Changes<br>
At this point there is no estimate on when or if we will be altering the paid faction change service to not reset the Argent Tournament questlines. It does set you back a bit but if you are aiming to farm for all the mounts then you can recover from it pretty quickly.<br>
<br>
If we have plans to remove content from the game we will try and give a heads up as early as possible, but right now there are no plans to remove the Argent Tournament. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/20133932014-argent-tournament--faction-changes.html))</div></div>
