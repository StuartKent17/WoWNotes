Boubouille2009-08-03, 06:00 AMPatch 3.2 Articles Update
5 New articles have been added to the site, most of the articles for the Patch 3.2 should be here now but I'm still missing a few things that I will try to post in a few hours. The patch will most likely hit the live servers this week or the week after, I will obviously post as soon as I get a decent confirmation about that.
