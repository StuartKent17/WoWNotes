The Azerite system totally encourages that, though. Unless you are a player that does not care about the traits other than the ones you have on it is in your best interest to hold on to gear with different traits, especially when balance changes happen.<br>
I care about the traits but if a hotfix makes what I have worse and something I tossed better AND it&#x2019;s not just a tiny difference then I&#x2019;ll just restore that item. This has only happened a couple of times over many years of playing. I also have bank space and often pile up things I feel are important until I sort through them and then do a mass bank-space-cleansing.<br>
<br>
A lot of changes just come with patches though and that likely means new gear, new sources, and higher level stuff so unless it&#x2019;s a huge deal I&#x2019;ll just get the new stuff.<br>
<br>
I can see what you are saying that you feel there is more pressure to keep the gear but I don&#x2019;t feel it&#x2019;s too different from the past. If I was aiming to min-max in all situations then I&#x2019;d expect to be hanging on to more gear but as I mentioned earlier if there is only a small to tiny percentage difference then I stick with one and clear up the space. Do you keep gear even if it&#x2019;s a .1% difference? Where is the breaking point for your play style? With the current 30 slot bags that are available, how much empty space do you tend to have?<br>
<br>
And something that isn&#x2019;t directed at you Xoja but some others seem to just be asking for why we are okay with needing multiple pieces per slot at all and creating &#x2018;clutter&#x2019;. This is my personal stance, but I&#x2019;d say it feels like just a part of an MMO in that some items are better than others. If we were to simplify it we could just remove stats and have items that are &#x2018;average&#x2019;, &#x2018;good&#x2019;, or &#x2018;best&#x2019;. If the item is &#x2018;best&#x2019; it&#x2019;s the best, period. Then that item can degrade to &#x2018;good&#x2019; when a new &#x2018;best&#x2019; is available from new content. This would cover the bag clutter and simplify things but I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;d feel fun.<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s ok to have some items to be better than others, but it&#x2019;s not ok to bind item to specific spec, especially when those slots were usable for all specs for many years before BFA. This is the problem Blizzard refuses to accept and fix.<br>
How would you treat a piece of gear that has like heavy crit and is far and away the best for one spec and definitely the worst for another?<br>
<br>
It still gives you some benefit, even if it&#x2019;s smaller, unlike many azerite traits that only work for one spec, and give nothing to other. If traits were switching with spec, that would be non issue&#x2026;<br>
Azerite gear still comes some benefit even if 1 trait isn&#x2019;t active.<br>
<br>
Juggling three secondary stats is way different than juggling dozens of azerite traits.<br>
So at a base level you feel the system is just too complicated and it would better to simplify it?<br>
<br>
Anyone would, because the reforge cost really is outrageous. My question is more: Why do you have a reforge system you don&#x2019;t want people to use?<br>
Sometimes you make a mistake. Sometimes a piece drops that is great for one spec and you can respec something you have to work for another. Have you run into these situations at all? Or something else?<br>
<br>
I&#x2019;m allowed to wonder why the reforge cost is so high, though.<br>
It does get high if you are changing a lot for sure. The highest amount I ever paid was like 20 gold I think? Usually it&#x2019;s at the 5g amount though. Does that feel high or am I missing something here?<br>
<br>
The fact that you have to go to third party sites or use simc to figure out what trait is better isn&#x2019;t complex enough for you?<br>
I feel like that&#x2019;s going off the path a bit. I have been doing that for a long time due to trinkets, comparing set bonuses to item level, and deciding the value of secondary stats for each spec. How is this different for you now?

No Shared Rewards Across Classic and Retail WoW<br>
Mounts and companions you get in classic SHOULD NOT be usable across multiple characters on the same classic account, however, you should be able to have these rewards in retail. This will increase the longevity of classic.<br>
Like it was stated at BlizzCon there will be no crossover in rewards between Retail WoW and Classic WoW. I don&#x2019;t think there is any need to change that stance but I appreciate the post OP.<br>
<br>
I think its fair to ask for an opportunity to earn those rewards again however I don&#x2019;t think it should come at the cost of diminishing the rewards that players earned years ago and cherish. I think the opportunity to earn and have them exclusively on Classic is fair because its staying on Classic itself. I think any more crossover than that could be damaging and lessen the value or prestige of those rewards.<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s a pretty solid philosophy at the moment that there will be zero crossover of rewards. (Source (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1104312-please-reconsider-your-stance-on-retail-classic-reward-linking/))<br>
