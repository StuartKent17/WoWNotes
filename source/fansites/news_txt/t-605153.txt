Boubouille2008-02-22, 10:30 PMUpdate 12:00 CET - Added new material requirements for most of the Sunwell Plateau epic recipes, some of them have been increased massively like the Sunblessed Breastplate http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/sunblessed_v2.jpg Old http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/blacksmith_sunblessed.jpg

A new PTR patch is being deployed to the PTRs. This post will be updated during the next hours with all the changes.

Tier 6 changes
The Tier 6 belts/bracers/boots got some of their stamina back, not as much as the first version but it looks better now.

Hyjal/BT Jewelcrafting patterns
I don't think the designs are available from any NPC on PTRs yet, but the items are definitely in game and we should probably see them very soon. Basically, all the patterns rewarded through Scale of Sands reputation or dropping from BT/Hyjal bosses will be available from the Shattered Sun Offensive.

Lord Ahune loot table
Lord Ahune http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/lordahune2.jpg is a new Headless-horseman-like boss, you will be able to fight him during the Midsummer Festival June 21 - July 5 and after a small fight he might reward you with a few epics. That's a daily quest and you'll be able to summon him once a day.

Phase 1 - The boss spawns two types of adds and you can't really damage him, just take care of the adds and after a minute, Ahune will go into phase 2.
Phase 2 - Ahune submerges ragnaros-style and its Frozen Core will spawn, that's when you attack him ! After some time Ahune will emerge and you'll have to fight adds for one more minute, etc ...

Scaling issues
All creaturing scaling is broken in the current build. We decided to push it anyway since it was mostly cosmetic. There might be some issues with hit-boxes and animations but we wanted testing over the weekend with updated data and rather than wait three days, we pushed it with the bug live. Hey, it's the PTR =P

For a good laugh, summon your "Peanut" or "Egbert" pet if you have one =P
