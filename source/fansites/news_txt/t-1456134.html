Love is in the Air 2014<br>
Love is in the Air (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/423-love-is-in-the-air) once again, at least until February 24! It appears that nothing has changed this year, but you can still run the Crown Chemical Co. encounter every day for a chance at the Big Love Rocket (http://www.wowdb.com/items/50250-big-love-rocket) though! <br>

Warlords of Draenor - Casting While Moving<br>
Casting on the move is something we&apos;ve talked about a lot, and we&apos;re definitely making some changes along those lines. I don&apos;t have any details I can share at this point, but I can at least give some insight into our thinking.<br>
<br>
We like casting on the move, but not as a default. Spiritwalker&apos;s Grace is a good example of something we like; used intelligently, it can be very strong, and it feels good to use. On the other hand, Lightning Bolt always being castable on the move we&apos;re less excited about. You don&apos;t feel smart or skilled for using Lightning Bolt while you&apos;re moving, it&apos;s just sort of a free bonus that we&apos;re not sure is really needed.<br>
<br>
Things like Kil&apos;Jaeden&apos;s Cunning fall somewhere in the middle. The effect is similar to Lightning Bolt in that it&apos;s always active and you don&apos;t really have to think about it. However, you are effectively giving up either Archimonde&apos;s Darkness or Mannoroth&apos;s Fury in order to take it. Whether or not that&apos;s enough of a tradeoff is something we&apos;re discussing, but we have seen a lot more Warlocks giving up KJC for something else since Patch 5.4.<br>
<br>
It&apos;s also important to note that the ability to use a cast-time spell while moving is only part of the issue. In fact, while there&apos;s only a couple of classes that can do that, almost everyone has some number of instant cast spells they can use while moving. To really start shoring up the differences here, we need to reduce the number of instant cast spells as well. That includes healers.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re still iterating rapidly on all of this, so anything can change at any point, but that&apos;s what we&apos;re currently thinking.<br>
<br>
Million dollar question here. Hunters are arguably one of, if not the most, mobile ranged classes in the game. We can maintain our full rotation while moving. Are we considered a caster for the purposes of this discussion? Being able to do 100% rotation on the move is one of the few reasons I decided to roll hunter.<br>
We like mobility as the Hunter&apos;s &quot;niche&quot;. I won&apos;t guarantee you&apos;ll still be able to do 100% of your rotation on the move, but we want to try to keep what we can there. It&apos;s something we&apos;re likely to do a lot of iteration on.<br>
<br>
doesnt really change the fact that they said talents will be the same and wont be getting an overhaul like previous xpac.<br>
We&apos;re not going to overhaul the entire talent system again, correct. That doesn&apos;t mean we aren&apos;t going to change any talents.<br>
<br>
<br>
Blue Tweets<br>
Classes<br>
Don&apos;t you think talents should be spec specific? Fine keep this 3 talents in a row stuff but have separate trees for separate specs<br>
It wasn&apos;t in the original implementation but we do have the ability to customize talents per spec now. You&apos;ll see a bit of it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/427284579347492864))<br>
<br>
Planning to scale back incoming tank damage when we lose the cloak proc? Or should we just deal with it?!<br>
Incoming tank damage while leveling is always really mild for well-geared characters. At 100, content tuned to available gear. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427007978613383168))<br>

i noticed that demo locks with green fire turn into a green demon but when they are getting demonic fury they are purple, fix?<br>
I believe we didn&apos;t notice that until the last minute, and getting that art greenified didn&apos;t make it in time. Fixed in 6.0. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427022122515300353))<br>
hey that&apos;s really great to hear, is there any other warlock aren&apos;t getting updated for green fire?<br>
I think there was one other super minor thing... Like a glow trail you leave behind you when Demonic Leap, or something. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427032537383202816))<br>

Are there any plans to make Fury warriors less complicated?<br>
Rotationally, not significantly. We&apos;ll be taking steps to reduce button bloat, just like with everyone else. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427024402861924352))<br>

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/gb-en.png Connected Realms Update - 10/02<br>

<br>
English Realms<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
(RP) Los Errantes and (PvE) Colinas Pardas/Tyrande<br>
<br>
<br>
Any chance of English PVE realms getting some connecting love from you guys as to this date only 2 of these connections have been made versus 15 PVP connections.<br>
<br>
Top of my head I would say Bronze Dragonflight &amp; Hellfire are in dire need for a love connection to be made sooner rather then later.<br>
We&apos;ve nothing against PvE realms at all, there just happened to be more low pop PvP realms, which is why the list is a little PvP heavy right now. We&apos;re trying to help some of the smallest realms first, then work our way up to the bigger ones where possible.<br>
<br>
Even if this is an exception, it does bring about the question how it will be handled that rp(pvp) have additional policies that are likely to conflict with policies in place on pve/pvp realms.<br>
This is indeed an exceptional case for Spanish realms, due to the fact there was only one RP and one RP PvP realm. We asked the players on these realms what they would prefer, and this was the option they went for.</div></div>
