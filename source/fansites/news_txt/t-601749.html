(Keep in mind that it could be a test and it&apos;s not anywhere in the patch notes for the moment)<br>
<br>
Melee haste rating has been nerfed, and it now requires 15.76 points of haste to get 1% increased attack speed. (Instead of 10.51 on the live servers)<br>
<br>
Ranged haste rating calculation is the same as Melee.<br>
<br>
Spell haste rating has been upgraded, and it now requires 15.76 points of haste to get 1% increased cast speed. (Instead of 21 on the live servers)<br>
<br>
If you want to check your haste rating on both PTR and Live servers, you can use the two following commands :<br>
<br>
Melee haste rating<br>
/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(GetCombatRatingBonus(18))<br>
<br>
Ranged haste rating<br>
/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(GetCombatRatingBonus(19))<br>
<br>
Spell haste rating<br>
/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(GetCombatRatingBonus(20))<br>
<br>
You should get a % value in your chatbox like in the following examples. <br>
