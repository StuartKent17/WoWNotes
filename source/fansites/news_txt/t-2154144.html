Legion PvP Season 1 Rewards<br>
Some players did not receive their titles as expected - we are aware of this. We have a fix that will be deployed during realm restarts which should be happening within the next 24 hours. We&#x2019;ve made sure that all eligible players are flagged correctly, and we expect this distribution to go smoothly.<br>
<br>
We appreciate your patience with this, and thank you for your understanding. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/791266-legion-pvp-season-1-rewards/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20752439581?page=6#101))<br>

Holy shit can I please stop being dumped into silvershard mines with 3 BM hunters. 3 BM hunters on any team is an instant loss.<br>
what&apos;s your top BM Hunters In PvP complaint? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/817182997933760512))<br>
<br>
Thanks for being the BM Hunter hero we needed with regards to the tier set and Hati. If I could give you a bonus I would.<br>
Can&apos;t take credit, all of these things were done by the class team before I said anything, they are pretty on top of stuff (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/817476614107774977))<br>
