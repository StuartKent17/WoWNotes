Stay tuned for more information! Feel free to post anything you find in comments.
The Trial of the Champion is now open on North American PTR realms. We're going to leave it open for testing for a while, unless something is broken to the point of causing serious testing issues.

This is very much a work in progress, please make sure and post bug reports and feedback for this dungeon.

Make sure you note if you try normal or heroic mode, as well as your gear and dungeon/raid experience when posting feedback.
