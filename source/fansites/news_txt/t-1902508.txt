Warlords Season 3 PvP Start Date
Whoa man, I'm just blasted from one side of the earth to another...Why is there no break in-between to get honor gear and prep for the season to start?? I genuinely want to know what this change is going to accomplish.. is it for leigons timing or..? Someone please.. tell me..
For a while, we've thought that it would be more fun for the new Season to start immediately after the old Season ended. Players want to get right back to Arenas.

This time around, we did an evaluation and determined that we didn't need the empty week, so we found a way to eliminate it with the patch deployment.

So far, so good.

I agree completely with this decision +1 blizz. while we have your attention any chance you have an estimate for when the titles will be released?
As before, we'll take at least a couple of weeks to ensure that all awards are bonafide before distributing them. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/393747-early-season/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/19891439509?page=1#16

Warlords Digital Deluxe Rewards
With the Warlords of Draenor Digital Deluxe retiring, we know there are many who would still like to be able to get their hands on the digital items that came with purchasing it. To address this desire, we will be making these items available for purchase at some point in the future. These will then be available for purchase until the pre-patch for the new Legion expansion. Please note, the option to purchase these items is limited to those who already have a Warlords of Draenor license attached to their account.

Blue Tweets
Classes
All we ask is that you make the Mage Community aware that threads such as these have not gone unnoticed by Devs
Your feedback is not going unnoticed! Note: Innervate can only be cast on healers. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666329514767585280

is Chimaera Shot for marksman hunters gone?
Currently, yes. It's a talent choice for BM, where it fits better thematically. Still considering whether MM should have it. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666399896849678336

how about Scatter Shot coming back at legion? fits marksman cc right?
Marksmanship has a new ability: Bursting Shot. Short range cone attack which knocks enemies away. It's a "get away from me" option. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666400189637234688

Was doing some shaman theorycrafting but realized it wasn't stated what the maelstrom cap is. 100?
Currently, yes, although that number may very well change as tuning continues. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666401093618790400

Any chance Harpoon can be switched from a Charge to a Death Grip? The latter makes way more sense.
No. Death Grip is iconic to Death Knights, and our goal is to make classes more unique. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666400858976858113

Will there be a casting focus generator talent option for marks like steady or focusing shot?
Not planned at the moment. Arcane Shot is instant and generates Focus, which fills that spot well. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666400560199831552

In Legion, MM and BM hunters have no traps. Can we expect a similar technique to Explosive trap with glyph it is really fun?
MM has Bursting Shot for similar functionality. BM doesn't have a knockback. Sometimes NOT having all the toys is more interesting. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666400398874292224

Artifact Weapons
For MW monks, will artifact staves be displayed upside-down? That would look bad/weird https://t.co/3lDE9A2R35 minor glyph?
Staves no longer sheath differently for Monks. There were issues with many staves, so we decided it was time for a universal fix. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666376977054478336

having an artifact weapon that already shares the name of a cata weapon drop does not make my artifact feel special
Agreed. This name is not final. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666377178901147648

What if we by accident select the wrong node on our artifact weapon, will there be a way to undo this?
There will be a method of respeccing your Artifact, but it comes with a cost. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666377616006377472

PvP
Are tanking specs getting some PvP love in Legion? Will they be tuned to be competitive?
We're looking for new ways to get tanks involved in PvP. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666391889361264640

Hello. Will there be rank 1 titles account wide? mounts? atleast class wide?
We have no current plans to change how titles and mounts are distributed. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666392538022985728

Is there no Vicious Saddle Mount this Season?
There isn't a brand new mount for Season 3, but you can still earn the mounts that were available during Season 2. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666393460362997760


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Hey Greg. I know this is a question, that goes back to your prevoius life, but there was an intresting thred at MMO-C and I just kinda had to come and ask your pov and your insight: Why does it take so long to make raids, and what is the most time consuming aspect when making new boss fights.‎ 
When I was there, it was the raid art the architecture part hands down. Since they have grown the team so dramatically, that may no longer be the case. It is difficult to start boss encounter design until you have a room, since testing relies so heavily on fixed locations. To some extent, the design can be pushed shorter or longer depending on how art resources are coming along. 

What's the worst theorycrafting you've ever heard?
There are two categories of bad theorycrafting. The first is when someone just says something very uninformed or intentionally trolly and nobody pays much attention. The more interesting case is when a sizable segment of the population believes for something to be true, when it is not the case. This could be because the mechanic in question is really convoluted old WoW armor pen comes to mind or because a math error gets introduced somewhere along the way and everyone else misses it.

I can't narrow down the "worst" that I've ever head, though it's a great question. I'll think about it. I remember there being a lot of concern about how long WoW healers could keep someone alive who was taking an amount of damage that we intended to kill them. They were evaluating a worst case scenario where they had essentially already lost the encounter. It's hard to tell if they knew that was the case i.e. they were using a specious argument just to argue for buffs or if they really believed their particular class was too weak.
