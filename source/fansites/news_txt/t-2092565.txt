Patch 7.0 - Hidden Secrets
It looks like there are still hidden things in Patch 7.0 other than Artifact Appearances!
Cant believe 7.1 is about to launch and no one has found the hidden... heh. Nm. Who's excited about the weekend??? Muffinus 

When they still havent found the 7.0 secrets and 7.1 is almost out... *sighs @ the ocean* Muffinus 
Does whatever is still hidden have a notice at all? So we know if things are found or not?
Not to spoil anything but yes just about everything about it has been datamined Muffinus 

Its not in the ocean, the ocean is just a good thing to sigh wistfully at, you can stop looking in the ocean. Muffinus 

Outside of skins, ARE there some hidden things that players should be looking for?
in 7.0? Actuallly... yes. Muffinus

Patch 7.1 - Karazhan Attunement
Attunement to Karazhan will require follower ilvl of 850.
This is false, and based on misinterpreted datamining. The ilvl 850 follower mission associated with Karazhan is an "Investigate" mission, which gives you a quest for some bonus loot, exactly like the existing missions that send you into dungeons or into Emerald Nightmare.

The attunement questline for Karazhan primarily involves Mythic dungeon content. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Patch 7.1 Arrives on October 25!
Is Nighthold coming out in 7.1?
7.1 contains mainly the Return to Karazhan Mythic Dungeon and the Trial of Valor raid. Nighthold is not part of this patch.

Too soon, You have given us content too soon Executusornyx.
I think you will find yourself pleasantly surprised by the span of content throughout Legion. We've already noted that Nighthold is slated for early 2017. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Classes
I hate that StM is mandatory to be viable right now. We need two better viable talents that compete. I agree.
But fixing the row is a larger undertaking, and meanwhile, better to be a one-trick pony than a no-trick pony... WatcherDev 

PvP
New PvP leaderboards have launched!  holinka 

Will the Free For All, More For Me  achievement be retroactive, or will we need to complete the world quests in 7.1?
They will need to be completed in 7.1. WarcraftDevs 

Pet Battles
Now that that is over, what would it take you, random person, to get into pet battling? I'm talking sweet rewards here. AP? A new dog pet? Muffinus 
Something cool, like a storyline or something more of an upfront progression. Currently it seems like an afterthought system?
completely agree that an overarching quest/storyline could be a lot of fun! Muffinus

Environment
Using your creativity and ability to work within the World of Warcraft art style, create a small environment diorama that would fit well in the game world. Your quest: Concept, model, and texture an environment piece that you could imagine stumbling upon during your travels across Kalimdor, the Eastern Kingdoms, Outland, Northrend, Pandaria or the Broken Isles.

Required elements are trees, rocks, grass, and props, plus a small structure such as a shrine.

Your final piece should have a structure similar to the example provided below. We're looking for lower poly-count models e.g.: around 1,500 polys for a mature sized tree, so keep that in mind when creating your environment.

The final submission should be a high resolution JPEG file no larger than 5MB.


  

Character Art
Using your creativity and ability to work within the World of Warcraft art style, concept, model, and texture a non-player character NPC or creature that you could imagine roaming the plains of Durotar, exploring the depths of Deepholm, or just sitting in the Pig and Whistle Tavern knocking back a mug o’ Thistle Tea.

Required elements are the character or creature, along with some sort of clothing or armor. Feel free to go further by adding weapons or other accessories.

The final piece should have a structure similar to the example provided below. Stay within a budget of 6,000 polys with one 1024x1024 texture for the finished character.

The final submission should be a high resolution JPEG file no larger than 5MB.
