Patch 7.0 - Hidden Secrets
It looks like there are still hidden things in Patch 7.0 other than Artifact Appearances!
Cant believe 7.1 is about to launch and no one has found the hidden... heh. Nm. Who's excited about the weekend??? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787104748985921536

When they still havent found the 7.0 secrets and 7.1 is almost out... *sighs @ the ocean* Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787115388685299712
Does whatever is still hidden have a notice at all? So we know if things are found or not?
Not to spoil anything but yes just about everything about it has been datamined Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787122169318772736

Its not in the ocean, the ocean is just a good thing to sigh wistfully at, you can stop looking in the ocean. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787312606142795776

Outside of skins, ARE there some hidden things that players should be looking for?
in 7.0? Actuallly... yes. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787107433575354368

Patch 7.1 - Karazhan Attunement
Attunement to Karazhan will require follower ilvl of 850.
This is false, and based on misinterpreted datamining. The ilvl 850 follower mission associated with Karazhan is an "Investigate" mission, which gives you a quest for some bonus loot, exactly like the existing missions that send you into dungeons or into Emerald Nightmare.

The attunement questline for Karazhan primarily involves Mythic dungeon content. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/775942-gating-content-behind-follower-missions/ / Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17613702560?page=1#2

Patch 7.1 Arrives on October 25!
Is Nighthold coming out in 7.1?
7.1 contains mainly the Return to Karazhan Mythic Dungeon and the Trial of Valor raid. Nighthold is not part of this patch.

Too soon, You have given us content too soon Executusornyx.
I think you will find yourself pleasantly surprised by the span of content throughout Legion. We've already noted that Nighthold is slated for early 2017.

I hate that StM is mandatory to be viable right now. We need two better viable talents that compete. I agree.
But fixing the row is a larger undertaking, and meanwhile, better to be a one-trick pony than a no-trick pony... WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/785851058400686080

New PvP leaderboards have launched! https://t.co/NICkcw3J8X holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/786343435250700288

Will the Free For All, More For Me http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11474-free-for-all-more-for-me achievement be retroactive, or will we need to complete the world quests in 7.1?
They will need to be completed in 7.1. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/786249711451672578

Pet Battles
Now that that is over, what would it take you, random person, to get into pet battling? I'm talking sweet rewards here. AP? A new dog pet? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/785312742227972096
Something cool, like a storyline or something more of an upfront progression. Currently it seems like an afterthought system?
completely agree that an overarching quest/storyline could be a lot of fun! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/785315315420762112

Required elements are trees, rocks, grass, and props, plus a small structure such as a shrine.

Your final piece should have a structure similar to the example provided below. We're looking for lower poly-count models e.g.: around 1,500 polys for a mature sized tree, so keep that in mind when creating your environment.
