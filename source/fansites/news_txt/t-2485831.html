As we&#x2019;ve discussed before, the nature of WoW Classic sometimes invokes different memories for different players, and this leads to certain misconceptions for some about what is or isn&#x2019;t working as intended.<br>
<br>
The following is a list of commonly-reported gameplay in WoW Classic that is not actually a bug, and is working as we expect it to:<br>
<br>
<br>
Tauren&#x2019;s hitboxes and their melee reach is slightly larger than other races.<br>
Being critically struck while using /sit to sit does not cause abilities like Enrage, Blood Craze, and Reckoning to activate.<br>
Using the &#x201C;Automatic Quest Tracking&#x201D; option does not auto-track newly accepted quests. (It instead will start to track an existing quest once progress towards an objective is started.)<br>
Warrior health Regeneration is working at the expected rate.<br>
Quests objectives and points of interests are not tracked on the map or minimap.<br>
Completed quests are marked on the minimap with a dot. (and not a &#x201C;?&#x201D;)<br>
Feared players and NPCs run fast.<br>
Standing on top of other players while facing away allows spells and attacks to be used.<br>
Creature respawn rates are much slower than in Battle for Azeroth.<br>
NPCs which offer multiple quests may inconsistently display them as a dot or a &#x201C;!&#x201D; on the available quests list. They were inconsistent in 1.12, and we&#x2019;ve reproduced the exact inconsistency they had back then.<br>
Quests that are too low level for do not show up as a &#x201C;!&#x201D; in the game world.<br>
Available quests do not display a &#x201C;!&#x201D; on the minimap.<br>
On level up, the message: &#x201C;Your skill in Protection increased to 15&#x201D; was added in 1.12.1, and we&#x2019;re intending to keep that.<br>
<br>
<br>
We appreciate all of your feedback!<br>

Sharding Bug in WoW Classic Beta<br>
Seen a couple instances of sharding happening since the last server restart about an hour ago. Blizz, what did you do?<br>
This is a known issue that we are actively investigating. Please continue to report these types of mob-behavior if they are happening in other locations.

<br>
They just said it was a bug tho, it&#x2019;s a beta, this is what we test in a beta<br>
This is definitely why we do a beta test. We can also do things like reset the realm at a busy time like 4:30pm PDT to try and find the source of a certain issue where a crocolisk is losing it&#x2019;s brain due to how multiple processes are interacting and mirroring code to form a cohesive world. There were similar types of issues like this back in 2004 but we wanted to try and resolve this one before the weekend for the folks who are testing.
