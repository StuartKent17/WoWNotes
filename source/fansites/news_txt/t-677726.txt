Professor Putricide EU PTR Testing
Professor Putricide is being tested on EU PTRs tonight, the tournament streams will be disabled for the testing and will be reactivated shortly after. You can watch the tournament on Gotfrag http://www.gotfrag.com.

I know streams are very buggy ... There isn't much we can do about it, it seems that all 3rd party streaming sites decided to crash/bug at the same time ... :/

Abilities


<div style="width:700px; margin:auto;">During the fight against Putricide, members of your raids will have to drink the bottles in the lab to be morphed into Mutated Abominations. Abominations have spells to "eat" the puddles of Mutated Slime, doing so let them gain energy to use their other spells.</div>
