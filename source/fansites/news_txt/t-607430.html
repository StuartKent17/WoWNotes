M&apos;uru&apos;s Updated Loot Table<br>
Note: Not all these items drop directly from the boss. Some of them are gained by exchanging one of the drops and a [item=34664] for a new item from the Shattered Sun Offensive vendor on the Sunwell Isle. These items are tagged with a (*).<br>

Extended downtime for May 6th &amp; Patch 2.4.2<br>
Let&apos;s start with the beginning, Patch 2.4.2 probably won&apos;t be deployed today. However US realms do have an extended maintenance from 03:00 AM to 11:00 AM PDT.<br>
May 5th, 2008 8:10pm PDT<br>
We will be performing extended maintenance for all realms on Tuesday, May 6th. The downtime will begin at 3:00am PDT and end at approximately 11:00am PDT.<br>
About Patch 2.4.2, Hortus posted a message to inform people that the testing of the patch was complete ...<br>
We will be taking the 2.4.2 PTR down shortly and ending the 2.4.2 PTR phase. <br>
... followed by a post to explain that 2.4.2 testing on PTR would be extended, this was probably caused by a serious bug found at the last minute and there is pretty much no chance to see the patch deployed on live servers this week.<br>
We have decided to put the 2.4.2 PTR up for some additional testing. The realms should once again be available for play. <br>
It also means that the patch is almost complete, and it wouldn&apos;t be surprising to see it on live servers next week. Anyway, we do have a long maintenance in front of us and you might want to read the 2.4.2 related posts to be ready for the patch once it&apos;s ready. <br>
