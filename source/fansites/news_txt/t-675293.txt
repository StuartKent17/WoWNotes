Welcome to another excitement of a new PTR build! This news will be updated with tons of details over the night, stay tuned!

Looking for ... Raid?
We already knew that 3.3 will let us join cross-server random group for dungeons, but apparently Blizzard is working on a functionality to add the feature to raids! Nothing is official for the moment, it might only be here for testing purposes

Patch 3.3 PTR Notes Update - 10/23
General
Character Creation: The descriptions for races, classes, and race/class combinations have been improved to provide new players with a better idea of the roles and advantages of each class and race. 
Knockbacks no longer dismount players. If on a flying mount, you will be knocked back a short distance before being able to resume flying. 

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid 
Balance
Force of Nature: Health on the treants has been increased.
Feral
Predatory Strikes: The Predatory Swiftness buff from this talent now has a 5-second duration.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin
Protection
Divine Sacrifice: Redesigned. The effect of Divine Sacrifice is now party-only and the maximum damage which can be transferred is now limited to 40% of the paladin’s health multiplied by the number of party members. In addition, the bug which allowed Divine Sacrifice to sometimes persist despite reaching its maximum damage has been fixed. Divine Sacrifice will now cancel as soon as its maximum damage value is exceeded in all cases. Finally, damage which reduces the paladin’s health below 20% now cancels the effect early.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue
Vanish: For the first half second after this ability is used, neither Vanish nor Stealth can be broken by taking damage or being the victim of a hostile spell or ability. Change Reverted

User Interface
Many of the default Interface Options settings have been changed for greater ease of use by new players. Existing players who create new characters may want to review the Interface Options in the event that the default settings feel different. 
Buffs and Debuffs: This is a new section added to Interface Options.
New option - Castable Debuffs: Enabling this will cause only debuffs you have cast on an enemy target to appear.
New option - Consolidate Buffs: Enabling this adds a buff consolidation box near the mini-map. Very short term buffs e.g. Replenishment and very long term buffs e.g. Prayer of Fortitude are filtered into the buff box. The icons are stacked here, but they can still be seen by moving the mouse cursor over the buff box. Long term buffs will move out of the box when they are about to expire. Buffs such as important procs e.g. Art of War, Lightning Overload, cooldowns e.g. Bloodlust / Heroism, Combustion or limited in range e.g. totems and paladin auras are always displayed.
Tutorial System: The tutorial pop-ups are now larger, contain images, and better try to direct players to the relevant locations or user interface elements on the screen. In addition, several new tips have been added, while some existing tips will now appear at more appropriate times for new players. 
Dungeon & Raid Difficult Display: A group’s dungeon or raid difficulty setting will now be displayed via an icon off of the mini-map. 
Group Disenchanting Option: In addition to rolling “Need” or “Greed” on items, players now have the option to elect for an item to be disenchanted. “Disenchant” works exactly like “Greed” except if a player wins the “Greed” roll, they will receive the disenchanted materials instead. Players who choose “Need” will always win the item and will always beat those that choose “Greed” or “Disenchant.” 
Lag Reports: Players can now report high latency or lag by accessing the Help Request menu. 

Professions
Fishing
The all-new Kalu’ak Fishing Derby, a test of fishing skill with a healthy dash of luck, has come to Northrend! Every Wednesday beginning at 8 PM players can try to catch the elusive Blacktip Shark. Elder Clearwater sits in Dalaran for one hour awaiting the return of the quickest, most experienced fisher to bring him this shark. This champion fisher will be rewarded in-kind for returning with the first catch. Those who aren’t able to return with the first catch will still receive just reward for getting the Blacktip Shark to Elder Clearwater before he takes his leave. It is said that these sharks’ favorite meal are the bite-sized Pygmy Suckerfish. Perhaps a hook in their waters will do the trick.

Achievements
The Achievements to get exalted with the Warsong Gulch, Arathi Basin, and Alterac Valley factions have been removed from their respective “Master of” Meta-Achievements. Special titles will be offered to those who reach exalted with these factions.
“The Party’s Over” has been removed from Achievements and is no longer a part of the “Glory of the Hero” Meta-Achievement.
“Master Angler of Stranglethorn” has been changed to “Master Angler of Azeroth” and can be achieved by winning either the Kalu'ak Fishing Derby or the Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza.

Items
Arena Set Bonuses: The two-piece set bonus for all Wrath of the Lich King Arena sets now provides 100 resilience and 29 spell power or 50 attack power. The current four-piece bonus will remain, however it also now provides 88 spell power or 150 attack power. 
Shaman Tier-9 4-Piece Set Bonus Elemental: This set bonus now places a damage-over-time effect on the target when Lava Burst deals damage instead of increasing the size of the Lava Burst.
