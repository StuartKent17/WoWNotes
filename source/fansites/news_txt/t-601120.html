The devs actually mentioned today that Paladin tanking wasn&apos;t exactly where they wanted it to be and there would be attention paid towards that end of things. Overall, they do expect Paladins, Druids and Warriors to fill tanking roles in end-game, whatever they may be. While there may be a flavor distinction between tanks, we don&apos;t want to (or want the players to) find some rigid hierarchy by which classes are measured in their tanking potential to the third decimal point.</div></div>
