Battle for Azeroth Cinematics: Expanding the Narrative

As a group, they wanted to turn the story inward after Legion.
The team looked to better their writers room after Legion.
Horror was a big motivation in the Aszhara cinematic.
Christie Golden does voice over for the script.
The team didn't want any music for the Jaina cinematic until her mother handed the necklace over. It was only then that the guitar came in. They didn't want it to be too "musical theater".
Originally the "Lost Honor" cinematic was going to take place at the cemetery in Arathi Highlands added after Before the Storm. Anduin would go there and reflect on his conversation with Saurfang in the stockades.
When the team set out to create the Alliance cutscenes they realized that they needed to develop Jaina's story more.
They dealt with Jaina's story with the idea of depression in mind, shown through the realm Jaina was banished to.
"If you ever have a chance to use Arthas; use Arthas!" - Christie Golden
Christie and Terran thought it was a good idea for Jaina to finish her redemption without firing a single shot.
