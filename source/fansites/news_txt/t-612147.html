We added screenshots to some of the zones pages. We&apos;ll probably update some articles this week, don&apos;t be surprised if some of them look strange at some point, it won&apos;t last more than a few minutes. <br>
<br>
Gun&apos;drak (Article (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=795))<br>
A lot of effects were added, boss rooms labeled and it definitely looks great now. <br>

Caverns of Time - Stratholme (Article (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=794))<br>
I never really took the time to take a lot of screenshots of the zone, this is now fixed. Note that the Crusader&apos;s Squad was updated in one of the latest build and is now filled with Scourge weaponry. <br>

Feral Tanking in WotLK<br>
Nobody can really compare a level 80 prot warrior to a level 80 feral druid because those individuals don&apos;t exist yet. Therefore, we have made almost no attempt to compare their tanking stats except to say &quot;Man, bears could probably use something like Last Stand and something like Thunder Clap&quot; and &quot;Hey, let&apos;s make sure bears don&apos;t have to scrounge for rare +defense leather or even +resilience in order to be uncrittable.&quot; That work is coming.<br>
<br>
Bears are able to tank some end-game content even on Live, so I don&apos;t think they are orders of magnitude behind warriors. In situations where they struggle, it is sometimes because of crushing blows or mechanics introduced specifically to drive warriors to tank, Shear for instance. I&apos;m going to be tanking Ulduar on my bear, so I&apos;ll be the first to complain if I feel the class design isn&apos;t up to it.<br>
<br>
As far as the previous poster who likes the Feral as the tank / dps hybrid, I don&apos;t think anything we&apos;re doing will really hurt that. You may be 5-10 talent points behind a tank-focused Feral or a dps-focused Feral but if you liked OTing the bear boss in ZA and then dps&apos;ing on the eagle boss, you should still be great at doing that. The difference is the bear who does spend those talents on threat, mitigation and oh snap abilities instead of +Shred can actually be a raid&apos;s primary main tank.<br>
<br>
One of the best rogues I know occasionally raided in blue gear or with no talent spec just to remind everyone that player skill often has a much bigger impact on your contribution to a raid than anything else. I know it&apos;s easy for anyone to drag out antecdotes that nobody else can validate, but it&apos;s worth keeping in mind.<br>

Now I am imagining the &quot;GC said you don&apos;t need talents or gear to tank, so obviously X class isn&apos;t going to get any!&quot; quotes. 1) Not true. 2) Sigh. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/8537784293-feral-concerns-in-wotlk.html))<br>

Overpower in PvE<br>
I can&apos;t recall if I mentioned this, but one thing that comes up a lot is letting Arms get better use out of Overpower in PvE. No promises, but I wouldn&apos;t at all be surprised to see something like this. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/8765745935-ghost-any-word-on-dps-specs.html))<br>

Tanking multiple targets in WotLK<br>
Shockwave is a cool ability, but if it is the ultimate AE tanking ability, that isn&apos;t really going to let dps warriors tank Utgarde. I also know plenty of warriors and bears that can get a large pull to stick them like glue even today. But it takes a lot of tab-targeting and a lot of skill. Skill is always going to be a component of tanking, but since you can&apos;t always gauge the skill of someone you don&apos;t know, we&apos;d rather give everyone good tools to tank a 5-player run.

Bloodworms Healing<br>
The Bloodworms should heal you for 150% of the damage they do. If they hit for 30, they should heal you for 45. There were some bugs with the calculation until recently. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/9023605409-fix-the-bloodworm-healing.html))<br>

Death Knight Auras in Buff Bar<br>
We turned the aura icons off. Once you get the talent, that aura will be up all the time so we thought it was annoying to have the icon always there reminding you. Most passive talents aren&apos;t shown as icons. It shows up for the other players in your group, however, to remind them.

Black Ice<br>
Black Ice says it affects &quot;spells&quot; but I believe the way it is set up is just to improve Frost and Shadow damage. I&apos;m not sure if anyone has tested that or not. Changing that tooltip could have a big effect on Frost and Unholy.</div></div>
