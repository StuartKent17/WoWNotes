This Week in WoW History
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.

Arena Season 9 - Cataclysm PvP
Season 9 was the first Cataclysm arena season, during which the Rated Battleground system was also introduced. In the MMO-Champion tradition, the armor sets for each classes were shown off prior to release. Same as previous expansions, the first season featured pretty boring sets, but setting the theme for future armor sets.


  

New Map and Minimap Features
Patch 4.3 introduced a few map and minimap updates, such as showing the level range of zones when hovering over them on the main map. Archeology zones, and quest objectives were added to the minimap, indicating the objective zone.


  

Guardian Cub
The first tradable Store Pet was added to the game in 2011. Unlike other pets, the Guardian Cub could be bought through the Blizzard Store, then traded or sold within the game for gold. This pet is the tiny counterpart of the Winged Guardian, which can still be purchased in the store.


  

Upgrade Your Gear!
Valor Points, or other similar currency was used to purchase introductory gear in previous expansions. Patch 5.1 introduced a new system, which allowed items to be upgraded by 8 item levels. This system was later used in other raids as well, and re-introduced during Hellfire Citadel in Warlords of Draenor.


  

New Expansion Name
Prior to the announcement of the fifth expansion of World of Warcraft, it was found that Blizzard applied to trademark “Warlords of Draenor” in multiple countries. Trademarks in the past didn’t necessarily indicate the name of new expansions, such as the previously trademarked “The Dark Below” title. However, in this case the trademark proved to be the name of the next expansion, which was later announced at BlizzCon.


  

The Garrison
During a series of posts in 2014, the full Garrison was introduced to the players. Everything from the art of the buildings, to specific followers, levels, and achievements were showcased. The Garrison was meant to be players personal bases in Draenor. This new feature came with a variety of building choices, as well as a few standard gathering buildings. Parts of this feature was later changed and improved to be introduced in Legion as the Class Order Hall.


  

Warcraft: The Beginning
The long anticipated Warcraft movie teaser was released featuring some of our favorite characters and places. This movie was directed by Duncan Jones, making it enjoyable for the general audience, while sprinkling some in-game references for the players. The cast included many well known actors such as Travis Fimmel, and Paula Patton.


  

Class Mounts Announced
BlizzCon 2016 announced many new features to be introduced in Patch 7.2, including new Artifact appearances, Tomb of Sargeras, and the Broken Isles. The unexpected announcement was the new Class Mounts, a few of which were revealed in the presentation. These new mounts changed color schemes based on the Specialization of the player, and were only usable by their corresponding class.
