Boubouille2007-10-24, 05:49 AMMore 2.3 Patch Notes changes
A few changes have been added to the patch notes again or maybe I just missed them the first time. The major change this time is probably the removal of engineering skill requirements on [item=33093] and [item=33092]. Theses changes aren't on the PTR yet so we can't really preview the new reagents for the 74A Repair Bot It is the old one, not the one added in 2.3
Engineering
Engineering potion injectors no longer require engineering skill to use.
Jumper Cables XL is no longer a trinket.
The materials required for the Field Repair Bot 74A have been simplified.



World Environment
Gas clouds in Nagrand now produce motes of air.
Gas clouds in Zangarmarsh now produce motes of water instead of motes of life.

Reaching Zul'aman is way too dangerous for Alliance Players on PvP realms. Blizzard plans to add guards and also look at how the area is flagged to see if they can make some changes. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366689345&pageNo=10&sid=1#198

PvP
The requirements to get titles and rewards at the end of season 2 might change to prevent "inactive teams" from getting them. Blizzard will provide a two weeks notice before the end of season 2 to announce any changes to how they determine which teams would be considered "eligible".
