Why on earth would you nerf BM when it was already terrible? Or is it an oversight that it got collateral nerfed by MM?<br>
.That Kill Shot change has an extremely trivial (&lt;1%) impact on Beast Mastery. With MM nerfed, BM should get some play now. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/542131895731892224))<br>
Problem is BM was already low.<br>
.It&apos;s difficult to say anything conclusive (UP or not) about a spec that only 1-3% of hunters play in raids. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/542145416301527040))<br>

You realize Gladiator is still ahead of both arms and fury on ST right? Fury is close, though.<br>
It&apos;s almost as if that was the goal... (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/542164932142190592))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Changing previous tweet: Looking for feedback on extra damage debuff to tank flag carriers IN RBGs. Too much? Too little? Just right? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/542003230557741056))<br>
FYI: In RBGs only, tanks take extra damage when carrying the flag. They do not in normal battlegrounds. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/542003498183688192))<br>
<br>
Seems like the pvp scene is lacking control of balance changes this expansion.<br>
All hotfixes aren&apos;t released at once. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/542124400447733761))<br>
<br>
Lore<br>
Morning Dave, is it possible to be both undead and demon? For example, Xavius died and his disembodied soul was separated from<br>
Lorewise, I think so. In game terms we choose one or the other for mechanics reasons (shackle undead, etc!) (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/542430851909173248))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
Even with a barracks and level 3 inn, a person with only lvl100 followers often ends up with ZERO missions.<br>
The intent was to taper off missions as you leveled so it felt like you had to check in less, but were more rewarded (1/2) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/542193303848906752))<br>
In retrospect, missions are probably more fun than anticipated, it&apos;s good feedback, we hear you. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/542193761032228865))<br>
