Patch 4.3.3 on Live Realms probably this Week
The final version of Patch 4.3.3 Build 15354 hit the Blizzard download servers and it means the patch will most likely go live this week. This build seems to be the right one unless something terrible happens, as usual, but it almost never  does.


 

This patch doesn't really have anything interesting for players, it's mostly a bug fix patch with a way to consolidate most of the Patch 4.3 hotfixes into the game files to display them properly.

If you are testing the 64-bit client, make sure to remove it before the patch, as it blocks the update from working correctly. You can find the full list of files to remove in the support article  There is no new 64-bit client uploaded yet, so you will have to make do with the old 32-bit client until an update is released. 


 

The only significant change is the refinement of the Scroll of Resurrection interface  The new strings hint at the 5 unused invite limit being changed into a daily limit, along with the newly listed 100 limit  in Account Management. 


SOR_DEFAULT_MESSAGE - "Remember the good times in WoW? I do, so it's time to come back!"
SOR_DISABLE_CHOOSE_A_TARGET - "Select someone to send the invite to."
SOR_DISABLE_NO_INVITES_LEFT - "You cannot send any more invites today."
SOR_INSTRUCTION_EMAIL - "Enter an E-mail address:"
SOR_INSTRUCTION_SELECT - "Select a friend or guild member:"
SOR_NUM_REMAINING - "Invites left today: %d"
SOR_SUCCESSFULLY_SENT - "Your Scroll of Resurrection has been sent!"



Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud 
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud  will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
Hard drives remain expensive, so now is still a good time to buy a SSD, as the next generation is a while away and the current prices are fairly flat , with sales bringing the cost very close to $1 per gigabyte. 

New Ivy Bridge CPUs from Intel are rumored to be released in April still, so if you are not in a hurry they will be a nice upgrade from Sandy Bridge. The current motherboards should support the new CPUs. 

The new 7970 GPU from AMD has been released and can be had for ~$580 if you can find it in stock. The 7950 is ~$450 and the 7770 is ~$160 and overpriced for the performance. The more interesting GPUs, 7850 and 7870, should be here soon as well. New GPUs from Nvidia likely won't be here before April or May. 

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.
