Patch 7.2.5 - Wild Call Changes<br>
In 7.2.5, we are changing Wild Call from a cooldown reset mechanic to a cooldown reduction mechanic.<br>
<br>
The base proc chance will be doubled and the cooldown reduction per proc will be 3.0 sec (affected by haste), roughly half the average expected value of current live Wild Call procs. Baseline, the amount of total Dire Beast casts and Dire Beast uptime should be roughly the same as on live, except the changes should result in smoother Focus regeneration from more well-paced Dire Beast casts.<br>
<br>
Additionally, these changes have the desired side effect of bringing the power level of The Mantle of Command more in line with other legendaries.

Is there a reason why prowl no longer has a stealth animation? I just run like normal.<br>
This was an intentional aesthetic change. Movement speed while Prowling was so fast that the walk animation didn&apos;t&#x2026; (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/847169471622004737))<br>

does crafting a legendary will reset my built up &quot;luck&quot; of getting a new legendary or not?<br>
Crafted legendaries have no impact on your luck with drops. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/847167246891855872))<br>

Can you guys also check into the fact that lower honor levels are requiring twice as much to level<br>
Is this after prestiging? We redistributed the honor to level out how much it is per level. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/846827559979405312))<br>
But the amount of honor it takes to go from 1-50 is slightly less than before. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/846827678569185280))<br>

new saddle mounts such as bear and lion missing from vendor, but turtles in there. Update?<br>
turtes are new this season. Other mounts will come later. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/846860419603955713))<br>
<br>
Where will the elite gear vendor be located in game?<br>
The vendors are in Dalaran in Greymane&apos;s Enclave for the Alliance and Windrunner&apos;s Sanctuary for the Horde. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/846797221244784640))<br>

7.2 in a few days now, many advancements to World Quests (rare q&apos;s, class q&apos;s, multipart q&apos;s, zone invasions), let us know what you think! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/846199186588524544))<br>
Rare quests? Sounds intriguing. Hopefully they offer something rare!<br>
.the idea is that some World Quests only show up for a limited time, so you see something actually rare! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/846203550677975040))<br>
so when I actually use a toilet to go and pee I might miss them? <br>
they are up for a while, if it&apos;s not up by the time you are done I would see a doctor (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/846205166198022146))<br>
<br>
The World Quest system can grow to encompass many gameplay elements, from dungeons to raids to herbalism, etc. What would you like to see? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/846215478485827585))<br>
<br>
TELL ME: your most popular world quests in Legion. And why. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/846216878720659456))<br>
whatever I can finish quickly and with minimal effort. not particularly fond of the system &#xAF;\_(&#x30C4;)_/&#xAF;<br>
WoW is a game of many playstyles, what would you prefer? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/846219562693550080))<br>
<br>
Noticing that map icons appear for dead rare bosses on Broken Shore. Is this intended?<br>
If you still see the icon, the rare elite will respawn there within a minute. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/847467868044185603))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
What&#x2019;s your opinion, as a director and as a player on the big passionate feeling some players have towards Vanilla WoW, to the point of wanting it back in some form? I personally think that they&#x2019;re somewhat &#x201C;stuck in the past&#x201D; and maybe I have a hard time understanding the whole situation.<br>
I mean, I get it. *I* have a big passionate feeling about vanilla WoW. That&#x2019;s when I fell in love with the game too. That doesn&#x2019;t mean it makes sense for Blizzard to offer a vanilla option (or support someone else offering it). The technical challenges are serious, and I think players are being a little too hopeful when they promise nobody will mind bugs or jankiness.

<br>
Do you think that it&#x2019;s ever possible to make power acquisition in WoW completely uncapped and still somehow find a way to avoid burning hardcore guilds out?<br>
Probably not. <br>
<br>
One of the safety valves that exists for really hardcore guilds is that they have a brutal few weeks or months, but then they finish the content (and feel everyone is sufficiently geared for the next tier to come) and can take a break, go back to a normal schedule, and potentially even check out other games.

<br>
You were around when thunderforged and warforged loot were introduced, right? Don`t you think that this kind of reward only piles up the anxiety and stress to min-max?<br>
That is a risk for sure. However we were also faced with a risk that loot was becoming really formulaic, where seeing what a boss dropped wasn&#x2019;t super exciting, and it was pretty easy for players to calculate at what calendar date they were going to be able to complete their gear. I&#x2019;ll argue it&#x2019;s hard for loot to be exciting if there isn&#x2019;t a random element, and so the challenge is making sure it&#x2019;s random enough to be exciting without being so random that it&#x2019;s frustrating.
