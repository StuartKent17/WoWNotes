Upcoming Feral Buffs<br>
As well, please, i beg you, make berserk stays up when you change the form, countless times i needed to change form to cast a regrowth to buff my bleed damage via bloodtalon (first time), only to see berserk buff vanishing.<br>
Going to send a hotfix soon to fix this. Berserk should persist through shapeshifting, same as Tiger&apos;s Fury and Incarnation: King of the Jungle. Thanks for pointing it out.<br>
<br>
After doing our internal testing, taking into consideration the feedback here and elsewhere, we&apos;re now going forward with the following damage increases:<br>
<br>
Brutal Slash: +20% Damage<br>
Swipe: +15% Damage<br>
Thrash: +15% Damage<br>
<br>
We don&apos;t have a precise timeframe for this to hit the live game, but we expect it in the next 48 hours or so.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bounty Bag Hotfix<br>
We&apos;ve hotfixed the bounty bags to always reward 100 honor, regardless of how many you loot. Keep in mind looting bounties also increments the achievement &quot;Bounty Hunting&quot; which is needed for the meta achievement &quot;Conqueror of Azeroth&quot; which rewards a title and mount.<br>
<br>
When the season begins, Bounty Bags will reward Conquest.<br>
<br>
Thanks for feedback, and the lively discussion!<br>

No WoW Panel at gamescom<br>
We do not have a dedicated World of Warcraft panel at gamescom this year as such.<br>
<br>
We instead have a series of other activities such as Island Expeditions showcases with 2 top German guilds battling it out, a Battle for Azeroth cosplay showcase, Video Games Live performances featuring a live rendition of the sea shanty from Warbringers: Jaina, and the reveal of Warbringers: Azshara.<br>
<br>
Warbringers: Azshara will be shown directed after the Battle for Azeroth cosplay showcase which will be streamed live from 18:15 CEST on Friday, 24th August.<br>
<br>
We posted a blog yesterday that covers all the WoW related stuff happening at gamescom this year:<br>

Call to Arms: Vol&apos;dun Quest<br>
Need to remove the Air Supply Crate. You shouldn&apos;t base this quest on whether you get lucky or not. I have been in this wasteland for over an hour, and ran to 2 chests that were called out only to have one despawn in front of me and the other despawn before I got there.<br>
<br>
It&apos;s not fun what so ever. So, either remove it, or let them last A LOT longer and pin them on the map.<br>
We agree. We are removing the Air Drop requirement in a hotfix. Should be live soon.<br>
<br>
