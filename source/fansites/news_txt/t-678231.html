The Icecrown Citadel raid test schedule will be very flexible, and can change at a moment&apos;s notice due to build status, bugs, and server issues. Remember that this is the test server, so things can, do, and will break from time to time. Check this forum for the latest Icecrown Citadel raid testing schedule information in the weeks to come. <br>
