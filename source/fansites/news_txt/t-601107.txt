Good news, website should now be fixed for Internet Explorer users and we've got the Dire Maul Gromsblood and Dreamfoil movie up and running to keep you busy.

You may see a few SQL errors at the bottom of the pages, but it should be fixed soon and even if it's not it doesn't change anything as far as I know

Updates coming soon !
