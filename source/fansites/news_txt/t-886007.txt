The Patch 4.1 PTR Notes http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/160430/patch-41-public-test-realm-notes-april-12 have been updated to reflect the changes from the latest PTR build.
Dungeons & Raids
Dungeon Finder

Players will now get bonus rewards 7 times per week while earning less than 980 Valor Points instead of once a day when using Dungeon Finder.
When there is only 1 player left in a Dungeon Finder group, they will now be able to queue for replacements as long as they queue within 2 minutes or stay in the dungeon.
Once the dungeon is completed the eligible player will receive a Satchel of Exotic Mysteries account bound with various potential rewards including: gold, rare gems, non-combat pets, and very rare mounts.


Guilds

The criteria on many of the profession-related guild achievements has been significantly reduced.


Items
Item Sets

The caster shaman 4-piece PvP set bonus now reduces the cooldown of Grounding Totem by 3 seconds, up from 1.5.


User Interface

The Network category contains the options "Optimize network for speed" and "Enable IPv6 when available". "Optimize network for speed" will be enabled by default, and will send packets more frequently at the cost of higher bandwidth. The higher bandwidth may lead to disconnects for some players who have limited bandwidth. Players getting disconnected frequently should try unchecking this box.
