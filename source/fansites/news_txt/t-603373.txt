Paid Character Name Change available in Europe
8 euros, same rules as the american servers.
Things to Know Before You Start!
The Character Name Change process is not immediate and may take several hours to complete because of the approval process involved. Your character will NOT be available for play during this time.
Each Character Name Change costs 8,00€ £6.00. This covers a single name change for a single character.
A character's name may only be changed once every 90 days.
The name you choose must be available on the character's realm, and must be within the World of Warcraft Naming Policy.
A Character Name Change cannot be reversed once completed, except by a second name change operation subject to the above costs and limitations.
Once the name change is completed, your character's old name will be locked from use on the realm for 90 days. After that time, the old name becomes available again and can be claimed by anyone on its realm on a first-come, first-served basis.
Please review the Character Name Change FAQ for answers to common questions about this service.
The Character Name Change service only allows one change per transaction. If you would like to change multiple character names, you will need to pay for each one separately.
