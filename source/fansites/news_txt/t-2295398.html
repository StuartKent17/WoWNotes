Artifact Knowledge Level 42<br>
It seems that the weekly increase in Artifact Knowledge is not tied to the regular weekly reset, as it went live on Monday morning. <br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
I stopped visiting the WoW forums a while back for reasons I no longer remember. I&#x2019;ve started visiting them now and then, but it&#x2019;s such a different feel. With the ability for everyone to upvote and downvote individual posts, there&#x2019;s a very strong echo chamber in effect. There seem to be &#x201C;acceptable&#x201D; and &#x201C;unacceptable&#x201D; opinions to have regarding the game, flying, difficulty/reward structures, etc. It discourages the minority from posting. What&#x2019;s the value in a forum rating system?<br>
I&#x2019;m not a fan of upvoting or downvoting, myself, even on our own forums. I think the intent is noble, of being able to bury spam or promote really insightful ideas, but what generally happens is you upvote things that agree with you and downvote things you don&#x2019;t agree with, no matter how well structured their arguments are.
