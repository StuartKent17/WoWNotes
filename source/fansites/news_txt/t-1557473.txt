Warlords of Draenor - Priest Tier 17 Armor Sets
Today we are taking a look at the Tier 17 Priest armor sets.

Warlords of Draenor changes things up slightly by using one set of art for Raid Finder, one set of art for Normal and Heroic, and one set of art for Mythic difficulty. You can find the Raid Finder armor sets in our Raid Finder armor sets preview http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3940-Warlords-of-Draenor-Raid-Finder-Armor-Sets-Draenei-Guard-Armor-Set-Blue-Tweets-Art.

Warlords of Draenor - New Area in Stormwind
The latest beta build added a small new area to Stormwind, with a portal and plants from Gorgrond. The area doesn't have a separate map name or any NPCs currently.

Tuning PvP without PvP stats?
It's a challenge, for sure, but one that we're going to a lot of lengths to make sure we get right. Many of the changes we're making in Warlords are intended to improve the parity between how the game operates in PvE and PvP, so we don't need to rely on PvP-only tuning mechanics as often. The increase to player base health is a fine example of one of those changes, as it hopefully allows us to remove Resilience and let players deal the same amount of damage in both PvP and PvE.

Certain other changes will have similarly beneficial side effects. For example, we've significantly reduced the amount of crowd control available in PvP situations in Warlords, largely in response to and agreement with the sentiment that extended CC chains weren't fun to sit through, and were putting too much reliance on certain classes and comps.

However, when players have control of their characters more often, the obvious side effect is that they can spend more time healing or doing damage. When you can reliably keep up a decent amount of sustained damage or healing, PvP balance becomes less focused on burst, which, in turn, makes it fall more in line with PvE balance.

That said, we're fully aware that things will never line up exactly perfectly and it might honestly not be all that great if they did. So, we're still very much prepared and able to implement PvE- or PvP-only tuning mechanics where necessary. We're currently experimenting with a debuff for Tank specs, for example. Should they become necessary, we can easily bring back mechanics like Resilience or the healing debuff from Battle Fatigue -- though they wouldn't need to be nearly as strong thanks to the other changes in Warlords.

Warlords of Draenor Theorycraft Discussion
Questions about Riposte, Tooltip says you gain parry equal to your crit %, which I assume means that if you have 15% crit from gear that you would get 15% parry chance before DR thats whats listed under the crit tooltip. but what's actually is happening is the crit rating is converted into parry rating then into parry% so you end up losing ~1/3 of the % from crit i.e. 1% crit = ~0.67% parry, is this the intend, or just a bug? Also trinket and enchant procs aren't included in riposte.
Intended; you gain Parry Rating equal to Critical Strike Rating, not Parry % equal to Critical Strike %.

Noticed that most of the armor enchants were marked as deprecated and the flasks seem to be as well, are the potions and food the only armor buffs left? sorry if this isn't theory-crafty enough
Yeah, where you're intended to have a choice between secondary stats, such as on food/flask/enchants/gems, we're not doing Spirit or Bonus Armor, since that takes away the choice.

lastly a clarification on Shield slams tooltip both wowhead and wowdb both say 3.83 AP but its closer to 3.08 AP at lvl100 in game.
It's 3.08. That may yet change in tuning though. Fixed the tooltip for now. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/318876-warlords-of-draenor-theorycraft-discussion/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13087818929?page=20#398

Beta Testing
Honestly, if you aren't willing to accept the risk of a Beta raid test failing due to bugs/servers, wait for the live release. Watcher https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/491348775353335808
Stress testing and raid testing at the same time honestly just makes development look rushed and incredibly behind.
We want the game to advance technically, too. Beta instability is no fun; server team pit was a zoo. Load testing is going particularly bad this time around. MoP, for the most part, went particularly well. kurtismcc https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/491398814939369472

Classes
why do I have to create a macro to /stopcasting and /use windshear. shouldn't this be the default was interrupts work?
Yes. We changed them to work this way. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489498371133296640

Problem: A talent is slightly underpowered, but perceived as completely useless.Risk: Buffing it enough to satisfy will make it very OP. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489526580218064898
Solution: Scrap it and come up with something new.
That's actually a totally valid answer in some cases. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489527077217914880
I would just trust in the math and buff it to where it should be and not worry so much about satisfaction/feedback.
I think it's actually more than the competing talents are perceived as mandatory, in this case. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489527376351477761
If something's perceived as "completely useless", that means the alternatives are so good they eclipse the "useless" talent.
Indeed, very astute observation. Something being called "weak" vs "useless" is usually dependant on its competition. If it has... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489527858792898560
...strong competitors, its value drops from "less than I'd like" to "zero". Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489527984831741953
"Buff the perception" is a shorter & snappier way to say it though
Right. A good solution is to buff it in a way that *sounds* like way more of a buff than it actually is. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489528478098661378

Can you please rename the new Pestilence to Blood Boil?
We talked about this recently, and decided to go with the name/icon of Blood Boil instead. Helps preserve the Blood flavor Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489497295860539393
And makes its rune cost more intuitive as well. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489497385442484225
Will the animation/sound effect also be preserved?
Unchanged from current beta build. Which is to say, BB visual, plus Pest between targets. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489501264598675456

BW doesn't break/immune Fear on live either, if I recall correctly? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489213152077160450
breaks all effects which cause loss of control of your pet. and just used BW on live when a lock feared me.
Oh! You actually mean on the pet. I thought you meant on the Hunter; my misunderstanding. Sounds like a bug; it should trinket pet Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489215965272358913

Casting RJW in single target is a degenerate dps increase for BrM. What has motivated legitimizing single-target RJW for WoD?
It's not being legitimized.It's a DPS increase because it's hard to make weaker than Jab. However, still big defensive loss. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489281759385640960
On beta, RJW currently generates Chi in single target. That's unquestionably superior to Jab in every aspect.
Oh, no, not intended. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489294565950488576

Are the level 30 talents for monks going to be tuned to be competitive with one-another? Chi Wave is too good to pass up on live
Yes. ZS is underpowered on live, but I wouldn't say that CB is. CB is strong AoE burst, and bonus raid healing. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489498195794591744
