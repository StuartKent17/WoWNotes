Patch 5.2 - Isle of Giants Updated
A recent PTR build populated the Isle of Giants with many colors and types of dinosaurs. All of them have several million health and drop a few Giant Dinosaur Bones , which can be turned in for gold, Mote of Harmony , Spirit of Harmony , Spectral Porcupette , or a Reins of the Bone-White Primal Raptor  

Each dinosaur will drop 1 to 9 bones, depending on luck and how much health they have. See the quest tables below for the amounts required for the rewards, but keep in mind this is the PTR and the numbers can change.

Orgrimmar and Stormwind Construction
It looks like the gates might be the extent of the repairs accomplished in Patch 5.2.

Hey GC, any reason to keep extra Sigils after completing the first Black Prince quests?
No. Source 

The problem is lack of viable options, in Cata there was only Dungeons, now it's only rep by dailies.
You're going to have a hard time convincing me there are fewer options now. I think some of you just hate dailies period. Source 

You think you've added diversity but the reality is you simple switched from a dungeon game to a daily game
Plenty of people are running dungeons and scenarios and LFR. In Cat, they only ran dungeons, and got bored quickly. Source 

tabards give rep. Put a daily cap on rep. Dailies or dungeons. Quit pretending solution isn't obvious.
Obvious but not healthy IMO. Only queuing for instances from cities isn't good for the game long term. WoW needs a world. Source 

World
Do you feel like CRZ takes away the one advantage small pop servers had of less competition for rare spawns?
We don't really want small pop servers to have advantages though. We think larger pop servers are more fun. Source 
Meanwhile, I generally prefer an uncrowded zone for questing. What are the specific pros/cons to the dev team?
I don't think WoW can compete well as a single player game. Its strengths lie in other players. Source 
However, I also believe that often those benefits are subtle enough that they aren't always obvious to players. Source 

When is Stormwind going to get repairs from Deathwing's attack? Getting sick of the ruins..
It just comes down to how artists and designers spend our time. Would you rather have SW or cool stuff on the 5.2 islands? Source 
You should have the old stormwind already in the files, update the texture and BAM, fixed stormwind
If it was that easy don't you think we would have figured that out? Source 

I believe vanilla was mostly better community-wise but you can't deny many major improvements.
I wonder sometimes if it felt better in vanilla just because more were uninformed. E.g. didn't know if an item was good or not. Source 

Classes
Out of curiosity is there a reason hit/exp cant have benefit past 100% chance? I don't know what though I admit.
We've talked about a small DPS buff, just as consolation, not something to shoot for. Source 

Oh so it was your fault that one healing class was standing outside buffing the entire Sunwell patch. Now I understand....
While the encounters were pretty fun, Sunwell was not kind to class balance. Helped establish our goals for the next 3 expansions. Source 

"We're sensitive to nerfing an ability that Prot has had forever."Could I have an explanation for the BW nerf? Had it since bc
Players finally convinced us that "can't be stopped" defenses would always be used offensively and often immediately in PvP. Source 

bloodlust/timewarp as an example
It's a challenge for sure! In that example, many players were telling us that they couldn't raid with friends for want of lust. Source 

Tanks don't solo well, don't pvp well, and raid spots are rare. Responsibility aspect no different from healers.
Disagree. Tanks solo phenomenally well. They are also near mandatory as flag carriers for RBGs. Source 
Also disagree about responsibility. Tanks are often expected to set the pace and even explain mechanics. Healers *can* blend in. Source 
if a tank isnt setting pace and the tank isnt paying attention it usually mean lots of wipes
In organized groups, the leader can be anyone. In pugs, the tank is often expected to be the leader. Source 

What does this mean for Touch of Karma, it's a defensive cool down that I use offensively also.
Defenses used offensively are fine. It's the "and I can't be countered" part that we finally reneged on for some abilities. Source 

so what about classes that never receive nerfs but continue to face roll since vanilla? Come again?
Which classes are those? Source 
Generally speaking, this game needs *more* class distinction, not less. "My class needs X like another class has" isn't going to sway us. Source 

Can you please stop making DoT trinkets or give Frost/Arc Mages some level of DoT? We're the only speccs that can't use LotC.
We think dot trinkets are interesting. It's boring when every class wants whatever the next +dps trinket is to come along. Source 

Dungeon Tabards were much better then the daliy grid now and Prime Glyphs had better talents.
You thought choosing a +5% damage glyph was interesting? Source 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Why do you say it's okay for BrM to have such a high skill cap to be useful, but when DKs did, you revamped them?
It depends on degree, and DKs are still plenty complicated compared to the older classes. Source 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Because the constant ramp-up of arcane is absolutely horribly crippling on encounters where you aren't a turret
Arcane isn't designed around 6 stacks all the time. We understand players want to stay at max stacks, but that's the challenge. Source 
But if there's anything we can do to stay at 6 always after 5.2 goes live, we will find it and we will play it.
Sure. That's how the spec works. It's our job to keep that interesting and not make it brain dead to accomplish. Source 

5.1 also gave us Mastery Stacking OR Haste stacking very similar numbers giving mages Haste/Mastery & Scorch/Abarr all viable
Making haste compete with mastery is a good goal. Making Scorch mandatory / rotational isn't a good way to accomplish that. Source 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Retune GoAK around being a 1-2 min CD imo. Make wings the big 3 min. 5 min CDs aren't fun, and hard to balance.
We'd prefer not to see the Guardian out that much. Too much visual noise. Wings is subdued by comparison. Source 

Got kicked out of my RBG Team til "Ret's get fixed'",let us benefit Healing from PVP Pow again and we are playable once again!
Once again, that PvP power nerf should have been ~20% healing. Can your team really notice that difference? Source 
It's quite a bit more than 20% it's 35% at best and it's the only survivability/utility with no counter a ret has.
How much PvP Power do you have? It's easy to convert that number to a potential loss in healing. Source 

Retribution paladins bust is high but sustain damage is low compared to other classes, any chance on a buff on sustain dps?
This is common feedback, but not sure how to fix. Wings to 10% or a 5 min timer? Ick? Source 
You should go check all the trash about rets in PvP,alot of people thinking of canceling their subscription 'bout it.Take care
We value feedback, but can't be held hostage by cancellation threats. It's just too easy a card to play. Source 

Ret paladin is under represented in 3s, 5s, and RBGS, which means that they are trash. What should a play with ret, tell me ?
Do you think those #s might show a sampling bias since many go Holy? I'm not saying go Holy. I'm saying data requires analysis. Source 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
But why did they all go Disc?, because holy just cant compete, i was holy for 4+ years and now i'm stuck in a spec i hate
Buffing Holy to have two overpowered priest specs isn't going to make other healer very happy. Source 
Who says we want Holy to be op? Holy priests would settle for decent regen, HW:Sanc worth casting, and a small perk.
The tweet I was responding to wanted Holy to be brought up to Disc level. Since Disc is mildly OP, that would make Holy OP. Source 

so what you're saying is basically that because disc is op its ok to ignore holy. What if we hate playing disc and love holy?
I'm saying nerfing Disc back down to a reasonable level well make Holy seem like an alternative once again. Source 

The Rapture change 250% is flatly wrong. It does NOTHING for Holy, plus makes disc scale outrageously. Need something else!
How does it make Disc scale outrageously? It was only broken when it stacked with temp Spirit buffs. Source 
It will scale outrageously due to gear improvment. More spirit = more mana from rapture. Holy still gets squat.
If it's a percentage, then it scales linearly with Spirit. Disc gets more mana than Holy, but casts PWS, a more expensive spell. Source 

An off the wall thought: if you extend Focused Will to Holy, you could make it restore mana too without wrecking pve?
I think that would be pretty frustrating for PvP though. How are you supposed to shut down a priest? Source 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Dear Mr. Street what do u think about removing preparation and make some cds shorter?
We've discussed that a lot. Our concern is you'd see rogues years from now still asking / demanding Prep back. Source 

The problem with BF was that Combat was awesome with ex. 2 targets, abysmal with 1.
We think "abysmal" is hyperbole, but we are trying to buff Combat single target to make up for the cleave nerf. Source 
5% to AP is "trying" - oh veey!
How much DPS do you think 5% AP is and how below do you think Combat is on single-target fights? Source 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Well now you realize this, any chance on buffing supremency so it's viable and we can use pets again?
Planned for 5.2. Source 

If we're supposed to use pets you need to fix the pet talent choice, currently it ISN'T a choice to compete.
We brought Sac back because some old time locks liked the play style. We agreed that the default lock should have a demon though. Source 

Warlocks are crap in pvp thanks to your theory crafting, do you even check your arena ladders ?
I see warlocks. What ladder filtering are you looking at specifically? Source 

So does that mean that part of the reason for the lock revamp was low pop numbers? among other things ofc
Partially, but also felt they didn't feel distinct enough from mages. "Warlock" has some fantasy equity, but not as much as "mage." Source 

If warlocks are supposed to use pets and are instead sacrificing them, where is the disconnect in design?
It probably means Sac is too good or Supremacy isn't good enough. Source 
Honestly, I think the pet-centric talents should have the slightest edges because of how they work in practice.
Yeah, we *try* to offer theoretical benefits to the things that are practically harder to use. Source 

is there a new Warlock class designer? and if not why? really like how the last one interected with us on MMO.
We don't have individual class designers. We work as a team. Source 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Even with 5.1 nerfs no rbgs or 3s want warriors anymore. 2.4k players have finally learned the weaknesses and no one wants it
So you're saying all those players complaining about warriors in PvP are behind the times? Source 
I dont know a single soul over 2k, muchless 2.2 that thinks warriors are good right now. Broken tfb gone and too easy tocontrl
That's not feedback we hear often, but to be fair, sometimes opinions take time to turn around. Source 

I think warriors had alot of cool stuff. Now you are nerfing alot of it.Why couldn't you balance that in BETA?Hate changes=
In beta we thought warriors were fine. We were wrong. At that point, the only fair thing to do is fix them. Source 
by fix do you mean nerf them to the ground and buff rogues so we are back in cata again?
Do you think that's what I mean? Source 

How is SW op compared to 5.2 dk conversion+ hunters spirit bond 2% 100% uptime. 3% sub 35 is to weak in comparison.
The difference is players can apparently overcome those heals. It's less about the ability than the whole package. Source 

your work isn't done, my rogue can still go 100-0 in shockwave
What are the sources of the damage being used to kill you in those 4 sec? Source 

U watching Arms' stat scaling? Mastery and Haste r below abysmal, str/crit is decent, and wep is everything... not very fun.
The problem with crit is making it a chance on crit to enrage would feel like double RNG. Source 


Chinese Gaming Theme Park
You may remember the theme park that was announced a while back, which included some Warcraft and Starcraft features. Reddit user Francesca shared  several images from a trip to it recently, and you can find some older pictures here
