Patch 5.2 - Isle of Giants Updated
A recent PTR build populated the Isle of Giants with many colors and types of dinosaurs. All of them have several million health and drop a few Giant Dinosaur Bones http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94288-giant-dinosaur-bone, which can be turned in for gold, Mote of Harmony http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/89112-mote-of-harmony, Spirit of Harmony http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/76061-spirit-of-harmony, Spectral Porcupette http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94190-spectral-porcupette, or a Reins of the Bone-White Primal Raptor http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94290-reins-of-the-bone-white-primal-raptor#related:reward-of-quest. 

Each dinosaur will drop 1 to 9 bones, depending on luck and how much health they have. See the quest tables below for the amounts required for the rewards, but keep in mind this is the PTR and the numbers can change.

Hey GC, any reason to keep extra Sigils after completing the first Black Prince quests?
No. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287642739569483777

The problem is lack of viable options, in Cata there was only Dungeons, now it's only rep by dailies.
You're going to have a hard time convincing me there are fewer options now. I think some of you just hate dailies period. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/286208553243521025

You think you've added diversity but the reality is you simple switched from a dungeon game to a daily game
Plenty of people are running dungeons and scenarios and LFR. In Cat, they only ran dungeons, and got bored quickly. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285914829137530880

tabards give rep. Put a daily cap on rep. Dailies or dungeons. Quit pretending solution isn't obvious.
Obvious but not healthy IMO. Only queuing for instances from cities isn't good for the game long term. WoW needs a world. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285914338504626176

World
Do you feel like CRZ takes away the one advantage small pop servers had of less competition for rare spawns?
We don't really want small pop servers to have advantages though. We think larger pop servers are more fun. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285815310253174785
Meanwhile, I generally prefer an uncrowded zone for questing. What are the specific pros/cons to the dev team?
I don't think WoW can compete well as a single player game. Its strengths lie in other players. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285912824792875008
However, I also believe that often those benefits are subtle enough that they aren't always obvious to players. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285912974533734400

When is Stormwind going to get repairs from Deathwing's attack? Getting sick of the ruins..
It just comes down to how artists and designers spend our time. Would you rather have SW or cool stuff on the 5.2 islands? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287649674289090560
You should have the old stormwind already in the files, update the texture and BAM, fixed stormwind
If it was that easy don't you think we would have figured that out? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287670187107426305

I believe vanilla was mostly better community-wise but you can't deny many major improvements.
I wonder sometimes if it felt better in vanilla just because more were uninformed. E.g. didn't know if an item was good or not. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287265250871496704

Classes
Out of curiosity is there a reason hit/exp cant have benefit past 100% chance? I don't know what though I admit.
We've talked about a small DPS buff, just as consolation, not something to shoot for. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285474642859266048

Oh so it was your fault that one healing class was standing outside buffing the entire Sunwell patch. Now I understand....
While the encounters were pretty fun, Sunwell was not kind to class balance. Helped establish our goals for the next 3 expansions. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285804548054974464

"We're sensitive to nerfing an ability that Prot has had forever."Could I have an explanation for the BW nerf? Had it since bc
Players finally convinced us that "can't be stopped" defenses would always be used offensively and often immediately in PvP. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285476838120243200

bloodlust/timewarp as an example
It's a challenge for sure! In that example, many players were telling us that they couldn't raid with friends for want of lust. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285892376906579968

Tanks don't solo well, don't pvp well, and raid spots are rare. Responsibility aspect no different from healers.
Disagree. Tanks solo phenomenally well. They are also near mandatory as flag carriers for RBGs. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285468420043067392
Also disagree about responsibility. Tanks are often expected to set the pace and even explain mechanics. Healers *can* blend in. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285468659713990657
if a tank isnt setting pace and the tank isnt paying attention it usually mean lots of wipes
In organized groups, the leader can be anyone. In pugs, the tank is often expected to be the leader. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285820761699143680

What does this mean for Touch of Karma, it's a defensive cool down that I use offensively also.
Defenses used offensively are fine. It's the "and I can't be countered" part that we finally reneged on for some abilities. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285805844963160064

so what about classes that never receive nerfs but continue to face roll since vanilla? Come again?
Which classes are those? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285801189801598977
Generally speaking, this game needs *more* class distinction, not less. "My class needs X like another class has" isn't going to sway us. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285800689966395393

Can you please stop making DoT trinkets or give Frost/Arc Mages some level of DoT? We're the only speccs that can't use LotC.
We think dot trinkets are interesting. It's boring when every class wants whatever the next +dps trinket is to come along. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285799918403203072

Dungeon Tabards were much better then the daliy grid now and Prime Glyphs had better talents.
You thought choosing a +5% damage glyph was interesting? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285799203668639744

Why do you say it's okay for BrM to have such a high skill cap to be useful, but when DKs did, you revamped them?

Because the constant ramp-up of arcane is absolutely horribly crippling on encounters where you aren't a turret
Arcane isn't designed around 6 stacks all the time. We understand players want to stay at max stacks, but that's the challenge. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285475236273598464
But if there's anything we can do to stay at 6 always after 5.2 goes live, we will find it and we will play it.
Sure. That's how the spec works. It's our job to keep that interesting and not make it brain dead to accomplish. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285816845611724802

5.1 also gave us Mastery Stacking OR Haste stacking very similar numbers giving mages Haste/Mastery & Scorch/Abarr all viable
Making haste compete with mastery is a good goal. Making Scorch mandatory / rotational isn't a good way to accomplish that. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285813837276520449

Retune GoAK around being a 1-2 min CD imo. Make wings the big 3 min. 5 min CDs aren't fun, and hard to balance.
We'd prefer not to see the Guardian out that much. Too much visual noise. Wings is subdued by comparison. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285476568162238464

Got kicked out of my RBG Team til "Ret's get fixed'",let us benefit Healing from PVP Pow again and we are playable once again!
Once again, that PvP power nerf should have been ~20% healing. Can your team really notice that difference? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285804108257038336
It's quite a bit more than 20% it's 35% at best and it's the only survivability/utility with no counter a ret has.
How much PvP Power do you have? It's easy to convert that number to a potential loss in healing. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285886163812773889

Retribution paladins bust is high but sustain damage is low compared to other classes, any chance on a buff on sustain dps?
This is common feedback, but not sure how to fix. Wings to 10% or a 5 min timer? Ick? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285148748064100352
You should go check all the trash about rets in PvP,alot of people thinking of canceling their subscription 'bout it.Take care
We value feedback, but can't be held hostage by cancellation threats. It's just too easy a card to play. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285889140522897408

Ret paladin is under represented in 3s, 5s, and RBGS, which means that they are trash. What should a play with ret, tell me ?

Buffing Holy to have two overpowered priest specs isn't going to make other healer very happy. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285470490703822849
Who says we want Holy to be op? Holy priests would settle for decent regen, HW:Sanc worth casting, and a small perk.
The tweet I was responding to wanted Holy to be brought up to Disc level. Since Disc is mildly OP, that would make Holy OP. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285814614204231680

so what you're saying is basically that because disc is op its ok to ignore holy. What if we hate playing disc and love holy?
I'm saying nerfing Disc back down to a reasonable level well make Holy seem like an alternative once again. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285803466482397184

The Rapture change 250% is flatly wrong. It does NOTHING for Holy, plus makes disc scale outrageously. Need something else!
How does it make Disc scale outrageously? It was only broken when it stacked with temp Spirit buffs. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285473209082593282
It will scale outrageously due to gear improvment. More spirit = more mana from rapture. Holy still gets squat.
If it's a percentage, then it scales linearly with Spirit. Disc gets more mana than Holy, but casts PWS, a more expensive spell. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285803092576960513

An off the wall thought: if you extend Focused Will to Holy, you could make it restore mana too without wrecking pve?
I think that would be pretty frustrating for PvP though. How are you supposed to shut down a priest? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285811908609732609

If we're supposed to use pets you need to fix the pet talent choice, currently it ISN'T a choice to compete.
We brought Sac back because some old time locks liked the play style. We agreed that the default lock should have a demon though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285469295494959104

Warlocks are crap in pvp thanks to your theory crafting, do you even check your arena ladders ?
I see warlocks. What ladder filtering are you looking at specifically? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285806631017652225

So does that mean that part of the reason for the lock revamp was low pop numbers? among other things ofc
Partially, but also felt they didn't feel distinct enough from mages. "Warlock" has some fantasy equity, but not as much as "mage." Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285817847752585218

If warlocks are supposed to use pets and are instead sacrificing them, where is the disconnect in design?
It probably means Sac is too good or Supremacy isn't good enough. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285823686777389057
