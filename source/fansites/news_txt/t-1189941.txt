Mogu'shan Vaults Raid Preview
Today we have an updated preview of the Mogu'shan Vaults raid! If you don't remember what the raid zone looks like, you can take a look at our very early preview http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2708-Raid-Sneak-Peek-Mogu-shan-Vaults-Heart-of-Fear-Terrace-of-Endless-Spring. Keep in mind that the zone was very unfinished at that time and that does not represent the final area. You can find these pages in the menu at the right of the navbar in the future.

Tiller's Daily Quest
We are also taking a look at one of the new daily quests that you do for the Tiller's faction http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2865-The-Tillers-Overview-Beta-Class-Balance-Blue-Posts-Raid-Testing-The-Daily-Blink. The Water, Water Everywhere http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30317 quest asks you to fly around the Heartland and water dusty spots in the crops. You can unlock a kite that flies much faster and a kite that flies higher later on. 

One extra source of rep we didn't mention in the original preview is harvesting crops! Each plant you harvest http://www.wowdb.com/factions/1272-the-tillers#related:awarded-from will give you 49 Tillers reputation.

MMO-Champion Forums Moderator Recruitment
Good news everyone! We're recruiting moderators for the forums again! The amount of users and posts keeps increasing and we reached the point where we need some help before the trolls take over and play Whack-a-Mod in the Darkmoon Faire. I know it sounds fun, but I'm going to assume we don't want that. 

This time around we are mostly looking for mods for the class forums as things to start to ramp up for Mists of Pandaria. Exceptional people are always encouraged to apply though! Please be sure to read the entire post before applying.

Darkmoon Faire Quest Reset Issue
We are aware of an issue in which the Darkmoon Faire quests did not reset properly. We are currently working on a hotfix that we will apply to all realms as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience.

The profession has been changed http://www.wowdb.com/quests/29482 to prepare for the upcoming expansion and will now require the higher grade material http://www.wowdb.com/items/72104-living-steel in order to complete the quests. Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5208543136?page=1#11

Class Complexity
You have to consider that WoW is a multiplayer game in which players are very often competing, whether comparing damage meters in a raid or out and out trying to kill each other in PvP. Changes to your your character end up affecting everyone who comes into contact with your character. If you can order up exactly what you want, you're affecting a bunch of other people.

In your hamburger analogy, you're telling the restaurant "You should make sure that nobody can have mayonnaise because I don't like it." 

I've actually used the restaurant analogy myself, because few restaurant patrons have the impression that they're going to be able to go back into the kitchen, give the chefs pointers, rearrange the menu and so on just because they think highly of their own opinions on food. Restaurants may honor your request to hold the salt or put the dressing on the side, and many chefs are probably thrilled to get feedback on the dishes they prepare to get an idea of what their customers like or not, but ultimately if you don't like a restaurant's food, you should probably go to another restaurant, not try and change the menu.

As far as class complexity, that's another attempt to serve a very diverse player base. Some players like a few buttons and some like to have a lot. If the restaurant required every dish to have the same number of ingredients, that doesn't improve the quality of the food. I only think it's a problem if some classes are so much more challenging to play that those players expect to do higher DPS as a result, or I guess if the number of buttons is truly stupid.

Also, remember that there is a huge difference between reasonable and optional. If adding an ability to your rotation improves your DPS by 1% then it might not be worth worrying about. I actually wish guides would focus a little more on describing both the "90% rotation" as well as the "theoretically highest rotation."

Second Wind and Healing Nerf
We applied a healing nerf to Arenas and BGs because it was getting impossible to kill anyone. We hope this is just a temporary 85 measure. 

Based on some of these reports, it sounds like percentage heals like Second Wind were affected. They probably shouldn't be. Percentage heals aren't boosted by PvP Power, so they shouldn't be nerfed by the blanket PvP healing debuff. We'll discuss and likely fix it.

Our stance on Second Wind hasn't changed. Under some circumstances, especially duels, it can account for a tremendous percentage of your health healed, but usually in group PvP where we spend far more balance emphasis you're unlikely to stay below 30% health for very long -- you'll either be healed up or killed.

Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
Hard drive prices are stagnant and still above the pre-flood prices, so now is still a good time to buy a SSD. The current SSD prices http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/september/ssdgraph.gif seem to have bottomed out for now, with almost all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte. A few sales have even gone under 50 cents per gigabyte, so look for something on sale!

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 3770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx and Nvidia http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/290-Computer for any extra questions or help getting an even better deal! If you are interested in Folding@home, take a look in our team's thread http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/948557-MMO-C-folding-team.

Mists of Pandaria Almost Never Was
The Verge http://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/8/15/3244037/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria-very-nearly-never-was had an interesting short piece back during Gamescom that is worth a read.


A different expansion was pitched, accepted, and background work and lore was started on.
The team then changed direction to Mists of Pandaria when everyone agreed that it felt right. 
This expansion goes back to World of Warcraft's roots more so than any expansion before it, thanks to the sense of exploring an entirely new area.
Mists of Pandaria has something that wasn't in the original lore and is more about discovery than previous expansions. 



Fan Art Update
