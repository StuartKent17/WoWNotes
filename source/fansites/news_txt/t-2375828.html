Activision Blizzard Earnings Call<br>
The Activision Blizzard quarterly earnings call didn&apos;t have a ton of news this time around. <br>
<br>
<br>
Blizzard is expected to grow in 2018 with the release of World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth this summer.<br>
Activision Blizzard had 385 million Monthly Active Users in the quarter, up from 384 million last quarter. <br>
Blizzard had 40 million MAUs for the quarter. While down sequentially, this is the 6th quarter in a row with 40 million or more MAUs primarily driven by Overwatch and Hearthstone<br>
For the second quarter in a row, players spent over 50 minutes per day in Activision, Blizzard, and King games, in line with some of the most engaging online connected platforms in the world. <br>
The inaugural season of the Overwatch League started on January 10 with 12 world-class team owners from across the globe, multiple league and team-level sponsors, a premium viewing experience and a robust distribution strategy. In its first week, the Overwatch League reached more than 10 million unique viewers across the world with an average audience of more than 280,000 on a per minute basis.<br>
Blizzard delivered record segment revenues and operating income for a year with no major game release, as they continued to deliver continuous content across franchises including Overwatch, Hearthstone, and World of Warcraft<br>
The Overwatch League has met and exceeded expectations. The focus now is on audience growth.<br>
