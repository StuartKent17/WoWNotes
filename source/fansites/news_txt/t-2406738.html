Developer Interview - Battle for Azeroth<br>
Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2018/06/25/world-of-warcraft-game-director-talks-mythic-plus-azerite-drops-and-discord/#78bcf49a7864) posted part one of its two part interview earlier with Game Director Ion Hazzikostas about mythic plus, Azerite drops and more in Battle for Azeroth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mythic Plus dungeons are designed and balanced with the idea that you can&apos;t swap gear during a run in Battle for Azeroth.<br>
Once you get past Normal and Heroic dungeons, sources of Azerite armor aren&apos;t infinitely repeatable. <br>
You can get Azerite Armor from an emissary cache, but not from a random world quest.<br>
You can get Azerite Armor from your weekly PvP reward, weekly Mythic+ reward, or from the Conquest system, but not just at the end of a match or Mythic+ dungeon.<br>
As it stands now, Mythic+ quality Azerite gear from your weekly cache will be associated with thresholds where new affixes are added (4, 7, 10). The level of Mythic+ completed in the week will determine which threshold of Azerite Armor you could get.<br>
As the expansion progresses, the ceiling of Mythic+ rewards will probably move from 10 to 15 much like in Legion. 10 will likely be harder in the beginning of the expansion as people learn the new dungeons.<br>
The team is trying to think how to better implement new dungeons to Mythic+ over the course of the expansion so issues like Seat of the Triumvirate being a harder/unpopular key doesn&apos;t happen.<br>
The team aims to have BfA dungeons retain the same difficulty of Legion dungeons. <br>
The team keeps affixes like Teeming and Bolstering in mind when designing the BfA dungeons.<br>
The 200 friend limit is a Battle.net limitation and the feedback asking to increase it has been heard, but communities should help in the meantime.<br>
The team looks at current chat systems when designing their own. Classic WoW was influenced by AOL Instant Messenger and others.<br>
Adding in game features like in-game voice chat is more of a convenience and not trying to compete with outside programs like Discord. <br>
In-game voice chat helps when doing world quests or other group content where you don&apos;t necessarily want to send Discord info or other chat program information.<br>
