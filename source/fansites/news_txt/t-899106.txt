Boubouille2011-05-05, 04:41 PMTier 12 Models Preview - Warrior
The Warrior armor set was also included in the files of yesterday's PTR build! If you missed the official preview a few days ago you might want to check it out if you're a Paladin, Mage, Rogue, Hunter, DK, or Priest.

A few things worth mentioning:



Other classes aren't in the game files yet
The helm of the warrior set is bugged on female models. 
Multiple recolors have ALWAYS been here, and doesn't mean that Blizzard is going to use one color for each spec or anything like that. It's been like this for years. The official previews don't have multiple colors so just assume there's only one.
