Class Hotfixes &#x2013; 3/12<br>
Any word on when Chi Wave is going to be fixed? As it stands we are lucky to get full duration in a raid setting. <br>
Our developers are aware of an issue with Chi Wave&#x2019;s heals not bouncing correctly and are working on a hotfix to correct this.<br>
<br>
PVE-wise it&apos;s understandable, but when frost bomb had to be nerfed to do 20% less dmg in pvp environment, and now you are buffing it by 40%? Is there really no other way to balance out pve damage, because it really is not fun having something over powered as frost bomb for pvp... <br>
Providing a clarification over PvP damage concerns.<br>
<br>
<br>
Frost Bomb now deals 60% of its damage when used against other players, down from 80%.<br>
<br>
<br>
Effectively a 4% buff in PvP then? <br>
That would be correct. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/256667-class-hotfixes-3-12/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8197590653?page=33#648))<br>
<br>
Throne of Thunder Hotfix Reasoning<br>
Hey all,<br>
<br>
Lead encounter designer Ion Hazzikostas (Watcher) has been reading through a lot of your feedback regarding the raid boss hotfixes, and he passed along the following response to this thread:<br>
<br>
I just wanted to offer some context for the recent tuning hotfixes to the Horridon and Council of Elders encounters in the Throne of Thunder raid.<br>
<br>
First off, the Council change, reducing their health in 10-player modes, was honestly just a bug fix. Yes, it made the encounter easier, which also makes it a nerf, but we simply goofed on the numbers. We generally aim for a 3:1 ratio of health for enemies in 25-player raids as compared to 10-player mode, since 25-player raids typically have ~17 DPS and 10-player raids have 5 or 6. Instead, the ratio on the bosses themselves (but not the Loa spirits or Sand Elementals) was mistakenly 2.5:1, and we didn&#x2019;t notice until we started taking a closer look at why 10-player groups seemed to be having a harder time with the encounter. I apologize for the error on our part.<br>
<br>
Second, regarding Horridon, that change was an intentional difficulty adjustment, with the aim of smoothing out the difficulty curve of the first section of the raid. By reducing the health of the trolls pouring out of each gate, we reduced the DPS requirement (and thus the gear requirement) of the encounter, but generally kept the mechanics checks intact. The trolls having 10-15% less health doesn&#x2019;t mean that raids can suddenly fail to interrupt Venom Priests, ignore Effusions, stand in Sand Traps, or cuddle up with Frozen Orbs. It just means that there&#x2019;s a lower DPS requirement to keep up with the waves while doing so.
