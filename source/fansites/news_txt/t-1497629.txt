Warlords of Draenor - Developer Interviews
There were a few developer interviews recently, so today we are taking a look at an interview from BlizzPro https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CG53OjeStw with Holinka, Kris Zierhut, and Steve Burke.

Level 90 Boost and Proving Grounds

You won't be able to queue for Heroic Dungeons or LFR until you have a certain level of Proving Ground achievements.
In a patch after release, Proving Grounds will be made to do a better job of telling you what you are doing wrong, rather than just being a test.
Players that don't have Proving Ground achievements will still be able to go into normal dungeons.


Questing

The Jade Forest quests had a very clear story, but it also had a lot of side quests that could bog you down. 
In Warlords of Draenor, your map will show you where to go to continue the main storyline, along with the locations of bonus objectives. 
The bonus objectives no longer have any story text that go with them, just a list of objectives. Now when there is quest text, you will know that it is really worth reading.


Garrisons

After rescuing members of the Frostwolf Clan in the Warlords intro quest experience, Durotan will give you a plot of land. This is where you start building your garrison. 
After you complete their quests, some questgivers will be available for you to recruit as a follower for your garrison.
You will be redirected to your garrison frequently throughout the leveling experience, as it is integrated into the zones and leveling experience. Every time you go back, you will see familiar faces from your questlines.
Garrisons offer lots of hard choices that give you nice rewards, such as the buildings you choose for your limited plots. Buildings and followers aren't a permanent choice though, so if you change your mind you can change things out.
As you go out and adventure in the world and irritate the enemies in Draenor, they will attack your garrison. You and your followers will need to fend off these attacks. 


Ashran

Ashran will have a big central battle that is pushing towards the other faction's base. 
Around the outer edges of Ashran you can find some rares and other things similar to Timeless Isle, with greater rewards to be found on the opposite faction's side of the zone.


Misc

There are a lot of advantages to having a realm community, so there aren't any plans to allow players to join guilds on any realm.
When you log in to Warlords of Draenor, you should be able to play with your friends. Allowing cross realm raiding and the changes to raid locks are one way the team is working towards this goal.
The team is still talking about a good reward system for completing older content with scaling, but there aren't any announcements for now. The Level 90 boost allows you to play with your friends without needing to level through the older dungeons now, making it less urgent. 



Patch 5.4.7 Hotfixes - April 14
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios

Siege of Orgrimmar: Blackfuse Bombling should no longer be incorrectly awarded from the Spoils of Pandaria encounter.
Icecrown Citadel: Resolved an issue that could prevent players from being able to loot The Lich King if NPCs dealt fatal damage to him.
The Eye: Added additional safeguards to the Kael'thas Sunstrider encounter to address issues that could cause him to sometimes not grant loot if he's defeated too quickly.


Achievements

Insane in the Membrane: Resolved an issue where Exalted status with the various Steamwheedle Cartel factions, as well as Honored status with the Bloodsail Buccaneers faction, were not properly being credited if those reputations subsequently decreased. Players should now be able to earn this achievement if they have ever brought those five reputations to the required levels.

Classes
Is there any difference for "melee range" for EnhShaman vs FeralDruid? Just my misperception? Shaman seems to hit from farther.
Nope. Same range. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449605236689100800

Wait, so if you have 100% uptime on your dot until the mob dies u never get the partial ticks?
You get the duration of it. Partial ticks are the 'remainder'. It's like saying you get 6.2 ticks per cast. If you just... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449263495129751552
...cast it once, you get 6 ticks and a 0.2 partial tick. If you chain 9 of them together, you get 55 ticks and a 0.8 partial Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449263800068235264
or did I misread and the duration per cast just keeps increasing by the partial amount with ticks always at fixed intervals?
Duration per cast remains fixed; doesn't change with haste. That's the point. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449272666185138176
ok I think the part I was not getting was this extra damage is handled on refresh of the dot. Correct? Thank you for the replies
The extra damage is a constant thing. Haste makes your DoTs tick faster, but doesn't change their duration. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449279937346682880
And with enough clip-chaining will 'partial' ticks ever become an extra 'full' normal tick, or are they...
Perhaps this will help: don't think of DoTs as doing X ticks. Think of them ticking at Y rate for X sec. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449606529772044288

will channels have partial ticks too? sorry if that got asked before
No; channels get shorter with haste, just as before. Channels are more like cast times with partial credit. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449653731152257024

Art
Is there going to be an update to the race dances? Aka. longer and smoother?
not longer, but with new rigging and animation clean up - dances should feel smoother. artofcgrobinson https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/448539093954088960

You mean model? That is pretty much certain. There will be winged arakkoa, which already necessitates new one
new Arakkoa model for sure, not definite on Kaliri - it's on wish list right now. artofcgrobinson https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/448540125199228930

Warlords of Draenor Stats
Wait...does Multistrike not trigger on SEF hits? Like you would do it, but your clones wouldn't?
Your SEF clones can multistrike, independently from you. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/448920331017674752
So we have 3x chance to multistrike, but for 1/3rd the damage. Evens out in long run.
Well, they're separate units. You could Blackout Kick, which your clone would mimic, and it may multistrike for clone, but not you. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/448921085036093441
Okay: Clarify please: 5.4: SEF clones multistrike or not? I understand they will in 6.0
I don't believe they do, but should be easy for you to test. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/448922836086689793

Do you think making Mulistrike a tank stat is going to be a problem? 25 people rolling on the same BIS Ring, Neck, Cloak =/= fun
There won't be 25 people rolling on the same Ring, Neck, or Cloak. Tanks want Bonus Armor and Healers want Spirit, for example. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449239645277003776

Your assumptions are wrong. It's not that skewed. Budget-wise, 0.3% Crit = 1.0% Multistrike. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449264285126885376
Also, while PvE/PvP crit 200/150 crit multi 160/130 balance w/ each other, PvP they devalue vs haste or readiness, no?
You're misunderstanding the PvP vs PvE difference of Multistrike. Same average, more consistent, in PvP. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449272444327432192
Well you'd know better than me so I'll take your word for it Any news on if/how Multistrike will interact with Healing??
It will, just as with damage. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449273483973779456

Can an ele shaman's overload trigger a multistrike? Can a multistrike trigger an overload?
Yes. No. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449605322835914752
Do multistrikes get a visual spell animation like overloads do? Would be fun to be a lightning bolt machine gun
Yep. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449616822120116224

can multistrikes crit? and would getting A fireball crit followed by a Fireball Multistrike Crit proc Pyroblast!...?
Yes. No. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449667521289785344

Thanks for the answer. So would death strike MS trigger the effects twice?
Nope. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449670718372859904

How does multistrike appear in the combat log? As "Multistrike" or the spell that triggered it?
As the spell that triggered it:You Fireball Murloc for 100.You Fireball Murloc for 30. Multistrike Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449607688687591424
How does multistrike interact with talents/passives that proc off abilities? Lava Surge, FDCL, Spell Reflected stuff?
Ones that can trigger from multistrikes will call it out specifically. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449667631230885888
Deathstrike won't heal twice off of MS? So what is the benefit to a blood dk? Seems bad.
There are other better benefits. It's not bad. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449678682081075201

PvE
Curious if devs feel WoW has become too difficult to play at endgame for the average player? A need to do "homework" to play.
We don't think so. No matter what we do, perfect performance will require extra effort. Takes less than before to do 90%. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449031499061280768

If healing won't be more difficult, how will more cast time on more heal not be more difficult. Like Thok HC?
Thok wouldn't exist in its current form. We design encounters to fit players' toolsets. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448484028279029762

Does "no more dynamic difficulty swapping" mean no skipping mythic bosses by dropping down to heroic?
Yes, each difficulty will be a self-contained experience. But with less linear layouts, you can choose somewhat. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448483198293377024
Depending on raid layout, understood. Still loot only once per lockout per boss at the Heroic/Mythic level?
Yeah, loot once per lockout. Heroic and Mythic are separate lockouts; Mythic is a fixed ID like Heroic is today. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448484978662207489

flex N/H going live at WoD or 6.0? Roster realigns suddenly places us at needing to test how some ppl's PC can handle 20 man.
6.0. There will be a few weeks of 20-player Mythic SoO along with flexible N/H before Draenor unlocks. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448536775061811200
You guys are fully retuning all of the current-tier raids to be compatible with class changes in 6.0? Or only heroic/mythic?
Siege of Orgrimmar, all difficulties. Prior zones aren't changing in structure or tuning, but they're trivialized by gear. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448538887359832066

No loot from bosses in 8 weeks.. Hope you won't call me a liar after 10+. Is this your idea of loot progression in WoD?
No loot at all, or just not the specific items you need? We do have plans to limit the impact of bad luck streaks like that. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448740540465422336

Leader can change loot option in combat when boss is low hp in order to take the loot to himself. Plans to stop this behavior?
Yes. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448843551250452480

I get that, just thought old content would be added to the new system.
Old raids were built around the other system; not a trivial conversion, and the time is better spent on new content. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448865884098945024

Why is that? Also, I've noticed old lockouts don't always work the new way, such as Kara. Intended?
That's how raid lockouts have worked literally since Molten Core. "Flexible" lockouts added in Cata, for Normal mode. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448864832364609536
And the "Why" was more "why not include heroic in the new awesomeness?" Like, what made you the team hold back?
Flexible locks permit loot abuse by organized groups. System makes it easier to PUG, but that's not the audience MoP Heroic raids. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448866251805192192

Any chance on revisiting KT in Tempest Keep? Perma-cc is pretty annoying. KT never heard of DR
There are mechanics in the fight to help with that. The goal isn't to make old fights trivial to solo; just doable. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/449202567046635523

What will happen to the CM teleport spells after they're removed?
Like other rewards, players who earned those teleport spells will retain them. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/449228698944684033

Why are realm first CM titles character specific instead of account-wide?
Because they reflect a skilled accomplishment with a specific class; same reason Gladiator titles aren't account-wide. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/449589470690422784

PvP
1. We'll keep an eye on the number of CC breaks in the game throughout beta. The widespread complaint was too much crowd control. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/448596181975711746
If no one is dying because crowd control is ineffective, it's an issue. Often those breaks support a specific class kit. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/448596324120666112
2. RBG cap is higher than arena cap. Source of major complaint and we aren't really happy with that system from a readability angle holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/448596551300960258
There are few things in the game as complicated as rating and conquest cap calculations. Should be simpler. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/448596747808296961
3. Not really sure about what you mean by tremor totem + totem reset. Call of the Elements? holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/448597594415984640

ever thought about an underwater BG?
I think it would be awful and don't ever plan on making one. Floating combat is not fun. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449246520928264192
What if the game focuses on it? Aren't spaceship games e.g. Wing Commander basically floating combat?
But you're forced to always be moving forward. I do think those games suffer from everyone flying around in circles though. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449249496078118912
Well, many of them allow you to full-stop, but point taken. Sense of scale/movement/strategy is tricky in wide open 3D.
I think the average player can get very disoriented in a space game. It's helpful to have a horizon line. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449251269635342336

Wouldn't pvp be better if all the addons were disabled? I feel kind of cheated for not using them. Some maybe don't know them.
It depends on perspective but macros and addons have value. It's a way to tinker with your setup and improve performance. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449308921576964096

About Ashran, due to the limited players of RP-PVP servers, will we see people from PVP servers too? Please, don't want empty zone.
Possibly. We'll try to avoid it if possible. We'll see what the numbers look like. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449568014564732929

if eu has majority of players pvping as ally and the new nerf to horde and buffs to ally wont it mean horde are a dying breed n pvp
I doubt it. Globally the Horde is overrepresented. High end arena players just tend to all pick one side to be together. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449568372896702466

PvPers would most likely sacrafice a bit of lore for quicker same-faction BGs. 
Just to be abundantly clear, same faction BGs is not on the table. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449568919003467776

What about allowing free, or half off, transfers from Horde to Alliance only to help the imbalance and queue times?
it's something we're exploring. It is A LOT more complicated than you'd think. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449632409655312384

Hey! Will it be possible to use [Alliance/Horde Battle Standard] in the new PvP zone Ashran?
There will be an Ashran specific version holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449685155028824064

Professions
Any chance Spirits of Harmony ever become BoA or BoE? Don't see what the harm would be in making it so in 6.0.
No harm in 6.0? I agree. Maybe even a little earlier. hwoome https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/449606490731462656

Reputation / Questing
Has to be TRULY different though, like leveling thru PvP vs LFD vs questing. Remember lesson from Golden Lotus dailies!
5.1-5.4 let us try out various things, 5.1 had great story unlock, 5.2 had epic treasure/raid fit, 5.4 gameplay/items Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/448682832479539200

World
And try to make rare mobs really rare, please. On TI, mainly, they are like the grass/ruppes on Zelda games.
Rarer mob can have higher drop chance, but less chance of you seeing it. What's ideal for you levelling/endgame? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/449321573858541568

Garrisons
I noticed a "Dance Studio" on a picture of the garrison UI. Care to shed some light on its purpose? Moral?
Just the UI guys having a little fun Not to say that there won't be dancing with your troops... Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/448681579519295488

How mandatory will garrisons be? They do NOT interest me at all. I'm starting to worry they won't be optional content.
Do you consider the farm mandatory? Why or why not? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/449321854700761088
Doesn't garrison have something to do with professions? Sounds more mandatory than farm's cooking items.
What elements of your professions are a "must do" for you? Does that change over the course of the expac? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/449323858550484992

Can we rearrange buildings after we built it for garrisons?
Yep, this was in the Blizzcon Q+A Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/449365514725257216


Wowcraft - Episode 2: Quest for Tooth
The second episode of Wowcraft takes a look at collection quests.
