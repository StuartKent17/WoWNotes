Contest Winners
so, did anybody win?
Yeah! 110 people to be exact! As well as the person and guest that won the trip to BlizzCon.

We're still finalizing some of the winners. Per the rules they have 10 days to respond to our email before we pick a new winner. Of course some people don't check their email, we pick a new winner, and sometimes they also don't check their email, etc. etc. this could go on for a long time... Plus the legal process for some of the larger ticket prizes requires physical documents being mailed back and forth. Long story short, we don't have a full final list of winners yet--although it's only a few stragglers remaining.

Instead of posting all the winner's screenshots 111 of them--not only because it's a lot of entries to post, but also because it was a sweepstakes, and not a judgment of the best screenshots--we're going to just be posting some of our favorites. We should have that up early next week if I were to guess. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

I would consider those more fel-corrupted living beings, not necessarily demonic, just corrupted. Aberrations. Muffinus 

...aren't shaman heals just water spells?
They used to be life spells! Now they are water. I think their res is still nature? I don't recall. Muffinus 

Pets and Pet Battles
About battle pets, ever considered that the system might be getting a bit bloated? There are 14 rats, for example.
Sounds like we need more cats Muffinus
