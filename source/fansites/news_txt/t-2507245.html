We are working to open our Free Character Move service for select WoW Classic realms in the coming days.<br>
<br>
When free character moves become available from one of the most highly-populated realms, players will see the option to initialize a free character move on either the character select screen or the queue screen of the realm.<br>
<br>
To best prepare, please note that a character cannot move if the character:<br>
<br>
<br>
is a guild leader.<br>
has active auction listings or bids.<br>
has mail.<br>
<br>
<br>
We will post full details about the realms available and character restrictions when we open the service.<br>
<br>
Thank you!</div></div>
