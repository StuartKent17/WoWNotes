Mimiron Hard Mode Nerfed<br>
In the past hours a lot of people have reported major changes to the hard mode version of Mimiron (See this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=67728.0)). So far it looks like the changes are:<br>
<br>
Emergency Mode (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/65101/emergency-mode/) has been reduced to 25%. <br>
The damage of Plasma Blast (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/64529/plasma-blast) has been reduced. <br>
The damage of Heat Wave (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/64533/heat-wave/) has been reduced.<br>
Emergency Bots in Phase 3 no longer have a silence aura in 10-man. <br>
<br>
Don&apos;t hesitate to post in comments if you have a few more details on that nerf. <br>
<br>
Patch 3.2 Heirlooms<br>
