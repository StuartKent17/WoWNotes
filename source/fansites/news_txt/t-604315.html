Yes, I&apos;m aware that there is a screenshot with supposed Sunwell loots screenshot (fake) (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/sunwellfake.jpg) (Link added because of the tons of requests I got in mail :/), but they&apos;re a fake from private servers, you can stop mailing it to me.

2.4 News ... soon.<br>
Blue posters are surprisingly inactive lately, however we got our weekly &quot;2.4 news are coming soon&quot; post. <br>
The Blizzcast is now out and we are working on compiling information on the Under Development for patch 2.4 to give everyone updates. It takes some time to do, but we will be updating before long. I&apos;m sure what everyone is really waiting for are the actual patch notes, but you&apos;ll have to wait for those to hit the test realm.<br>

Today&apos;s posts aren&apos;t really informative, but they might answers questions that people are asking themselves. <br>
No date for Arena Season 4<br>
No one will be able to tell you when the season 4 starts. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3913738209&amp;postId=40025816110&amp;sid=1#8))<br>

No date for the next Blizzcon<br>

Incgamers&apos; UICentral Trojan Infected<br>
Update : Rushster has since moved the file to a separate server to avoid this happening again. If you&apos;d like to read more about the issue, see the thread on Incgamers here: http://wowui.incgamers.com/?p=mod&amp;m=2106 (http://wowui.incgamers.com/?p=mod&amp;m=2106).<br>
<br>
Cairenn, an admin of WoWInterface.com (http://www.wowinterface.com) posted this thread (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3881821845&amp;postId=38813235984&amp;sid=1#0) on the official forums to warn users about a potential trojan in the latest version of incgamers&apos;UICentral (the tool used to auto update your mods).<br>
<br>
(4:07:58 PM) Shirik: So here&apos;s the deal. UI Central is packaged with a program &quot;patcher.exe&quot; which has code in it to go download an &quot;update.exe&quot; from a non-incgamers site<br>
(4:08:05 PM) Shirik: update.exe is then immediately run<br>
(4:08:51 PM) Shirik: update.exe proceeds to install itself as wzcsvbc.dll<br>
(4:10:01 PM) Shirik: It installs that from a remote site if possible, and if that fails it will instead use its own copy<br>
(4:10:26 PM) Shirik: It then registers itself with lsass.exe so that it can be resident at every startup while remaining hidden<br>
(4:10:43 PM) Shirik: After all that&apos;s complete, update.exe attempts to delete itself and shut down<br>
<br>
Now luckily for everyone (in one sense) it is the same one as showed up previously. Therefore, we already know how to get rid of it. <br>
<br>
If you&apos;re using this software, I suggest that you read the whole thread (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3881821845&amp;postId=38813235984&amp;sid=1#0) and check your system to make sure it&apos;s not infected.<br>
