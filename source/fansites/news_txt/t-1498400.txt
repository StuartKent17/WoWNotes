Old Character Models
Since we are being blessed with new character models Which can be disabled? Yes, no?
Yes, if you set your graphics quality to Low.

However, I am quite useless on Ordos and Sha since my frame rates dips to 1-10 FPS. Will the new models cause even more problems in world bosses and even in regular raids?
It's hard to say exactly, many things can influence performance.

Remember that characters aren't usually naked inside raids, which means that most of the polygons and textures being drawn and rendered aren't exclusively attributable to player models, but also to armor. 

On top of that, raids have their own surrounding geometry, bosses, etc... and all that adds up in the end. Obviously, new more detailed models means slightly more processing power is required, but new models aren't the only big change coming to WoD.

We are also applying a squish to anything related to stats; this means that in certain situations, there might be some performance improvements, especially when it comes to addons that process combat data.

More importantly, we are reducing the amount of visual clutter that currently fills every fight where a lot of players are involved.
Less sparkly stuff flying around means better video performance for everyone.

Client performance is something we care about a lot. It doesnâ€™t matter how well-designed an encounter is: you arenâ€™t going to have fun raiding at 8 FPS. We want everyone to be able to enjoy playing with the new models, and our dev team is working hard making sure that WoW is as resource efficient as possible in order for that to happen.

Shall I start looking for a new computer or should I stick with the one I have?
That's a hard question to answer. I'd say that you shouldn't be worried about any big drop in performance; things will most likely remain very close to what you are experiencing right now. So if you're satisfied with what you have right now, then there shouldn't be any need to change anything.

Xuen always Eminences, regardless of your own stance. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451894257368854528

So if SOOM doesn't generate Chi, what does?
Surging, Renewing, Expel, Chi Brew, Spinning Crane Kick, Jab. I think that's it. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451891158323445760
I see, with the scarcity difference will it not be a concern if Monks switch to crane specifically to build mana tea?
We are 100% committed to making sure that there's no cherry-picking between Serpent/Crane. We'll adjust as necessary if so. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451891681059540993
Also, is Muscle Memory now passive? It makes no sense to have it activate on Jab anymore with it being only in crane stance
See the Muscle Memory note in the patch notes. Merged into one passive. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451897821034061824

Reassure me: the plan is still Shadow loses utility, but gains damage, yeah? No more being the last people paying hybrid tax?
Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451897122451755009

I also... I... Subtlety rogues using FoK will be DROWNING in combo points. I don't even.
Yep. That'll be an interesting change to see how it plays out. We'll pull back on it if it ends up too strong, but trying it. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451890604528525312

You're overloaded right now, but a gentle nudge on this q if you're able: Is Blade Flurry undergoing a new round of changes?
May let it trigger poisons; still evaluating. Nothing to announce yet. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451899637083815936

Will Resto Shamans keep the stacked healing niche going into WoD?
They'll certainly be good at stacked healing, but they need a well-rounded toolkit to complement that strength. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/450798702550986753
Shamans rock at stacked, but too few strats use stacked groups :/
Stacking is the default strat on pretty much every fight unless we add mechanics to make you not do so. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/450909244229836801

Haven't been at Blizz long huh? I guess you don't remember what ele was like before LB was changed to allow casting while moving
I've been here longer than Unleashed Lightning existed. You now have several spells that you can cast while moving. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451890901095182336

"Restoration Shaman..with buffs elsewhere to keep them competitive." Why are none of these buffs mentioned in the blog?
Because we didn't mention most of the -/+X% Healing Done or -/+X% Mana Cost changes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451893370885910529

Will Improved Lightning Shield mean 8 charge Fulminations, or are you capping that at 6?
8 charge. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451895860532494336

LB on the move was a much more reliable source of damage, we're already one of the weakest casters, this doesn't help at all.
You won't be one of the weakest casters. We'll be tuning your damage hasn't happened yet to equal other casters. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451897079795695617

Will Elemental still be able to cast LB while moving? It's critical for Elemental's pvp, without we will have no dmg output.
No, but we're balancing around that, don't worry. There are actually several spells you can cast while moving instants. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451899529973866497

is a 5% buff to nightfall going to be enough to offset the loss of drain soul?
It's intended to make gameplay more similar between cases where you have adds to kill way too strong and you don't. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451891490629754880

Warlock: "Soulshatter has been removed" I rely on this a LOT to give aggro back to my demons which are designed to take my aggro
We'll adjust their aggro generation to compensate, so that you don't need it. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451892381869027330

sorry for the bump, need to ask... what will be mechanic for dot-heavy classes Aff? Timing my DoTs is all I do today
You'll still want to time your Haunts. Will be less important than before, but still important. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451894495181672449

Curious about the Shadowburn change to not generate mana. Without a cast time there's no mana regeneration like with Chaos Bolt.
Cast time isn't really mana regeneration. It was unnecessary complication. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451898981967081472

can we get an update on gladiator stance? and does berserker rage still generate RB charges?
See Wowhead/MMO-Champion's talent calculators for Gladiator Stance info. We're still considering Berserker Rage. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451896321117417473

PvE
Celestials not being tap-to-faction... bug or intended?
Intended. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451545154495578112

PvP
id say it has something to do with Role selection for bg's! it would use the same system as dungeons and that is why long queues
We disabled that system for a short period to see if it had any effect on queue times. It had no effect. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/450737812615090176
interesting!! cause when they were implemented that's when I noticed longer queue times.
They were bugged when we first introduced them, but it was fixed. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/450764201078693888
do you think the reason most people don't blacklist BGs is due to not wanting to blacklist any, or not knowing about the feature?
Not knowing about the feature. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/450774879369842688

For WoD, gear changes stats based on spec? Does that include pvp gear or only pve set raid gear? Want to gear feral+resto in arena
includes PvP gear holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/451429314840367104

In the WoD "instanced" world PvP zones, Will we still be able to use things like engineering glider/rocketboots?
We generally try to keep those things out of rated play, but there has to be a place in PvP where toys work. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/451493027068907521

Regarding WoD: Will heroic/mythic gear be stronger for PvP than PvP gear with the planned elimination of resilience?
No and we'll explain why soon. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/451495477632970753

seems like you have adjusted one side of the pvp armsrace. Melee mobility and cc breaks remain unchanged. Thoughts?
We have a lot of work ahead of us. We'll see how it goes. Looking forward to hearing feedback when folks play. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/451898616794185728

Pets and Pet Battles
What about making things like the Celestial Tourney a bit easier for us that can't seem to finish it this exp?
