chaud2017-09-11, 10:37 PMFinal Tuning on Netherlight Crucible
Some last minute changes were made to the Netherlight Crucible http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6942-Patch-7-3-Artifact-Changes-and-the-Netherlight-Crucible powers.
We’ve made a final tuning pass on the Netherlight Crucible to ensure that its powers behave more like the trinkets that you know and love.

In general, these changes are intended to bring the value of the various powers closer together, and ensure they’re desirable choices for players. We’ve loosened the restrictions these powers had on the PTR, so effects that previously did not take your character’s modifiers into account are now improved by things like Haste and Critical Strike, and relevant buffs or debuffs that are part of your class. We also updated numerical tuning to take those changes into account.

Tuning Changes: 

Master of Shadows http://www.wowdb.com/spells/252091-master-of-shadows – Value reduced to 500.
