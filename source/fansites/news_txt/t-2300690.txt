Some last minute changes were made to the Netherlight Crucible  powers.
We’ve made a final tuning pass on the Netherlight Crucible to ensure that its powers behave more like the trinkets that you know and love.

In general, these changes are intended to bring the value of the various powers closer together, and ensure they’re desirable choices for players. We’ve loosened the restrictions these powers had on the PTR, so effects that previously did not take your character’s modifiers into account are now improved by things like Haste and Critical Strike, and relevant buffs or debuffs that are part of your class. We also updated numerical tuning to take those changes into account.

Tuning Changes: 

Master of Shadows  – Value reduced to 500.
Murderous Intent  – Value reduced to 1500.
Dark Sorrows  – Proc rate increased by Haste. 
Torment the Weak  – Value reduced to 80,000. Damage over Time effect now increased by haste and can crit.
Chaotic Darkness  – Proc rate increased by Haste. 
Shadowbind  – Value increased to 200,000. Proc rate increased by haste. 
Light Speed  – Value reduced to 500.
Shocklight  – Value reduced to 1500.
Secure in the Light  – Value increased to 135,000. Proc rate increased by haste. 
Infusion of Light  - Value reduced to 101,000. Proc rate increased by haste. 
Light's Embrace  – Value increased to 45,500. Proc rate increased by haste. 
Refractive Shell  – Value increased to 300,000. Proc rate increased by haste. 


The above all differ from what you may have seen on the PTR, and we appreciate the time and effort that testers put into providing the feedback we received.
