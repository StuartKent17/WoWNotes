Blue Tweets
PvP
Not a loaded question, just curious, do you guys read arenajunkies forums?
Sometimes. Most topics quickly degrade into namecalling. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/679559487569563648

Lore
lore question if you'll indulge me: Where does Elune rank in terms of power? Old God level? Titan level? Even higher?
Those questions are more fun to speculate about than answer. Where do you think she falls? DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/679458248836026368


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Do you think mmo's would profit from having less numerical feedback? eg. combatlogs and tooltips
MMOs can't generally afford sufficient combat feedback without all the numbers. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/679678048979910656
Some fighting games have so much rich animation that it sells how you're doing with very little use of numbers. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/679678227472764928
MMOs often have to emphasize quantity over quality, and that usually means a pretty simple basic combat model. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/679678390719262724
By which I mean positioning, timing and so on have to be pretty simple. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/679678687084597249
They dress that up with depth, usually in the form of numbers, e.g. resistances, speed, crit, dots, and so on. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/679678897588322304


Legion Alpha - Demon Hunters and Nefarian
It looks like Nefarian was updated to have a Demon Hunter class call before the Alpha went down.
