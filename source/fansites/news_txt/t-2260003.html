Toy Box - Spooky Toys<br>
Today we are taking a look at three different spooky toys and how to obtain them. Obtain 300 toys and you&#x2019;ll receive the Mechanized Lumber Extractor (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140500-mechanized-lumber-extractor) mount, which is very similar to the Sky Golem (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/134359-sky-golem).<br>
<br>
Kalytha&#x2019;s Haunted Locket (http://www.wowdb.com/items/68806-kalythas-haunted-locket)<br>
If you&#x2019;re interested in playing as a ghostly female night elf, Kalytha&apos;s Haunted Locket (http://www.wowdb.com/items/68806-kalythas-haunted-locket) is for you!<br>
<br>
<br>
Features a 30 minute duration and only a 15 minute cooldown, making it one of the few toys that will allow you to chain transformations and stay disguised for as long as you&#x2019;d like!<br>
Transformation isn&#x2019;t broken by combat or mounting, and your character can still show off its awesome Artifact appearance.<br>
<br>
<br>
As long as you have the Flight Master&#x2019;s License (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/90267-flight-masters-license), obtaining Kalytha&#x2019;s Haunted Locket is quite simple!<br>
<br>
<br>
Head out to Azshara (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/16-azshara) and find Tex Vortacoil (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/36375-tex-vortacoil), a goblin vendor located inside Archmage Xylem&#x2019;s tower.<br>
He&apos;ll sell you Kalytha&apos;s Haunted Locket (http://www.wowdb.com/items/68806-kalythas-haunted-locket) for 5,000 gold.<br>

<br>
Death&#x2019;s Door Charm (http://www.wowdb.com/items/129149-deaths-door-charm)<br>
If you&#x2019;d rather be a ghostly version of your own character&#x2019;s appearance, the Death&apos;s Door Charm (http://www.wowdb.com/items/129149-deaths-door-charm) is the perfect choice.<br>
<br>
<br>
This transformation has a 30 minute duration, and the Charm&#x2019;s cooldown is 1 hour.<br>
Requires Revered reputation with Legion&#x2019;s Valarjar faction.<br>
Once Revered, simply head over to Valdemar Stormseeker (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/106904-valdemar-stormseeker), the Valarjar Emissary located at Valdisdall in Stormheim (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/7541-stormheim) to purchase the Charm for 425 gold.<br>

Haunting Memento (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116139-haunting-memento)<br>
If you&#x2019;re in the market for something a bit more unpredictable, the Haunting Memento (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116139-haunting-memento) is a fun little toy that can be used to &#x201C;haunt&#x201D; yourself or another player. <br>
<br>
<br>
The Haunting Memento (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116139-haunting-memento) can be purchased from Chester (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/85484-chester) on Darkmoon Island (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/5861-darkmoon-island) at a cost of 90 Darkmoon Prize Ticket (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/515-darkmoon-prize-ticket).<br>
Every three minutes, the afflicted player will fall victim to a haunting effect.<br>
There are over ten different Haunted effects, including:<br>
<br>
The sky turns into a ghostly blue stream of souls<br>
The player is swarmed by giant spiders<br>
The player is transformed into a skeleton or hideous beast<br>
