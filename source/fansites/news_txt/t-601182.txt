Since it's a new day without much news, a few words about what's coming.
This week it will probably start tomorrow, most of the raiding guides will be updated all of them, except Karazhan with more informations, and a nice extra feature. These changes will be considered as "beta" and your help in improving the new content will be greatly appreciated in the next days. Don't hesitate to use the contact link on the left for any contribution or question, i'll try to change it to a web mail form to make it easier to reports problems.

Concerning Karazhan guides, I don't want to waste too much time on them, and don't want to modify them too much since they're not mine thanks again to Soul Society http://nordrassor.freehostia.com/phpBB/index.php. Nevertheless, if you want to work on new Karazhan guides, I'm open to all offers. 

*cough* People helping a lot in the next few days may get something nice at the end. But let's not turn this into a contest ... yet.
