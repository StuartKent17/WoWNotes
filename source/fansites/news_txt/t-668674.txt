You might have seen a few spam posts on the front page a few minutes ago, it didn't last long but I guess it's worth an explanation. First, we didn't get hacked, it was just a small error with moderation. We do not delete spam posts, we just move them to a trash can forum where they can die happily with all their friends.

The problem is when I don't sleep enough in a night and actually move 6 of these posts in the "News" forum instead of the "Trash Can < Spam Goes Here" forum. This is how these posts appeared on the front page.

Everything is under control, you are now free to laugh at me and you can stop worrying. 

Also, Patch 3.2.2 is not this week.
