Update - Sources and various GM chats seem to indicate that this is intended, and the service will be offered for free for the moment, most likely as a trial.<br>

Cross-Realms Battle.net Invitation now Activated<br>
It looks like the feature to invite your RealID friends from other realms has been activated on US realms today. <br>
<br>
IMPORTANT - Since this isn&apos;t official yet, it could perfectly be a mistake from Blizzard. If that&apos;s the case you can fully expect it to be disabled soon. Don&apos;t get too excited. <br>
