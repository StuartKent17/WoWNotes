Blizzard has hotfixed Blood-Soaked Tome of Dark Whispers  to drop from Zul on Normal difficulty and up. It was discovered yesterday that it would drop for Hunters that Hearthstoned out during the fight, but this was unintended. This item allows Hunters to tame the Blood Beasts  added in Battle for Azeroth.
