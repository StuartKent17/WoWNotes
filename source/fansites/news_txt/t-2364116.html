Patch 7.3.5 PTR - Allied Races Unlock Requirements<br>
The latest PTR update updated the banners in both factions&apos; embassies that list the unlock requirements for each Allied Race.

Patrick &quot;Vanion&quot; Michalczak Passes Away<br>
Patrick Michalczak ran the German WoW fansite Vanion.EU (http://www.vanion.eu/) and passed away on January 2. It was always a pleasure to work with him and he will be missed.<br>
Sadly I have to tell you that Patrick &quot;Vanion&quot; Michalczak passed away on Tuesday, January 2, 2018. With this article I once again direct my heartfelt condolences to his family. I am sure that, as members of this community, you guys are as shocked as I am and every other person that has been in contact with Patrick. A lot of questions have followed after the shock. I ask that you give the family time to mourn and stray away from any sort of speculation. Vanion was a well known person and it would be sad if rumors and false news were spread.<br>
<br>
Patrick was not only a loved member of the German WoW Community, but also a loved brother, son and friend. I personally can&apos;t and won&apos;t share further details about this tragic event. Privacy has clear priority in such a matter and I only wrote this article because there was already speculation in the German community and I did not want it to spread further. Please be considerate of the mourning family members and friends. We will talk about the topic in more detail when the time is right.<br>
<br>
The work on Vanion.eu will continue just like it has been the past few days. It is also too early to talk about the future of this site, but you will hear from us in the coming weeks. I wish the best for all community members that have to stomach this sudden announcement and suggest lighting a small candle, even just a tea light, in honor of Patrick &quot;Vanion&quot; Michaelczak today. That would be a lovely gesture.<br>
