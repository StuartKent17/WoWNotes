Boubouille2007-06-27, 11:12 AMI removed the top part of the menu with the old 2.1.0 posts and the BT/Hyjal loots http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=215.0 will find a better place for them today, just need to think about it. 

A lot of users are now using the site as their starting page, and I thought it might be a good idea to add two nice search box instead, to search Wowhead http://www.wowhead.com items and Curse-Gaming http://www.curse-gaming.com addons.
