Blizzard / Dell partnership : New wallpapers<br>
Dell launched a new Dell XPS Gaming line with the support of Blizzard and created a WoW themed website (http://www.dell.com/html/global/topics/gaming/en/us/us/dhs/wow-signup.html) for the occasion. After giving away your name and email you will eventually end up here (http://dellgamingus.p.delivery.net/m/p/del/wow/Thankyou.html) with 6 wallpapers available at the bottom of the page. <br>
<br>
The 2nd wallpaper (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/november/dell/w2_1920x1200.jpg) looks a lot like Kael&apos;thas happily reviving things near the Sunwell, but I could be wrong. (Nice spaulders by the way)<br>
<br>
Update : It seems that it&apos;s an artwork used for an old TCG Card : Varanis Bitterstar (http://wow.tcgplayer.com/db/card.asp?id=469). No uber sunwell for you today people !<br>
