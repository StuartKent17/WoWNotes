Patch 5.3 - Brawler's Guild Shirts
Patch 5.3 adds several new Brawler's Guild bosses, which reward you with new shirts once they are defeated! These shirts all have an equip effect, which looks similar to the effect of Precious' Ribbon http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/52019-precious-ribbon, rewarding you with an extra buff on you at all times.

World First Level 90
You may remember that Fs was able to reach Level 90 before everyone else http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2940-Rob-Pardo-Interview-Level-90-World-First-Team-FS-Interview-Blue-Posts-Devs-Video through some clever use of game mechanics, but Blizzard reset him to level 87. We finally got an update on this today when his achievement was restored!

After some lengthy deliberation on this topic and evaluation of all facts, we’ve decided to overturn our decision on this matter. We will be re-instating Fs’s achievements. Our apologies to Fs for any frustration this has caused.

Crowd Control and PvP
With regards to crowd control, we don't really feel like there is too much of it, right now. We feel that CC is integral to PvP because without it battles simply become about tunneling and burst cooldowns. This is actually another situation where the question is touched on in a bit more detail in the "Ask the Devs — The Answers" blog which we plan to post tomorrow. So be sure to keep your eyes open for that 

Freezing trap, Sap and Gouge share the same DR. Same goes for Fear, Psychic Terror Psyfiend fear and the Blind disorient. Just wanted to mention that, but also that the developers briefly mention diminishing returns in the blog tomorrow as well.

Shado-Pan Trinket Changes
It procs and i got 6900 agi for 40 seconds.. ??? 
This is actually just the tooltip not being updated yet as that requires a client patch. If you check your character sheet while in either Battlegrounds or Arena, you will see that the effect only applies 4400 Agility or Strength and the duration of the buff has been doubled. 

This effectively halves the burst potential of the trinket and doubles its duration. This results in the damage being much easier to heal, but lasts a longer amount of time. So this isn't actually a bug, it's an intended change, the tooltip for the buff just isn't updated yet.

Btw nakatoir any reason you guys don't just remove it completely from pvp? 
Because that is not our intent. Our end goal is not to prohibit PvE gear in PvP, if it was, that is what we would do. There is actually a question about PvE items in PvP, in the upcoming "Ask the Devs — The Answers" blog. Keep an eye out for that as we plan for this to go live tomorrow.

None wants Pve trinkets in PvP, NONE. Why even make it viable? 4k agility for 40 seconds is almost better then 20 seconds because certain hunter rogue healer comps only have 40 seconds games Don't forget that in 5.3, this trinket will also be getting scaled back to iLevel 496. This means that the stat proc will be getting lowered with the reduced iLevel and then halved as well when inside Battlegrounds and Arena. So in 5.3, the affect of this trinket will be diminished even further.

Five Player Dungeons
I love 5mans, always did, they just seem to fit perfectly with what I enjoy most about WoW, playing with a small group of friends that also happen to be very good players. For me this made heroic dungeons one of the most entertaining things about WoW ever since The Burning Crusade, followed only by Arenas and heroic Raiding. So on that regard, totally agree, I would love to see more heroic dungeons popping up, but I don't necessarily agree that they’re needed because of catching up issues.

We’re aware that not everyone finds LFR entertaining, yet some of those players still run it for the drops, and of course… that’s not ideal. I mean, almost everyone enjoys the hunt for loot, it’s a big part of the MMORPG experience, but you should be having fun while doing it.
This is where I believe heroic scenarios and challenge modes can make a difference, those players will hopefully become more inclined to run these instead of LFR. Or in addition to LFR; as some players will always go where there is at least 1 loot upgrade for them no matter what, and that’s ok.

These rewards will have a higher ilvl http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=16758&filter-ilvl-min=516&filter-ilvl-max=516&filter-reqlvl-min=90 than current LFR gear still subject to change. With the possibility for better rewards than LFR, I would expect to see skilled casual players choosing to do for example one challenge mode daily quest and one heroic scenario instead of an LFR wing.

Also important to notice, Ghostcrawler recently said that devs are considering making heroic scenarios require a pre-made group.
This is quite a change, and if that goes live I believe that we’re on the path for having content for just about every kind of player, new and casual players will have dungeons, dailies, LFR and Battlegrounds; casual due to lack of time but highly skilled players will have challenge modes, heroic scenarios and Arena/RBGs, and the more hardcore/highly skilled players will have normal and heroic raiding in addition to all the rest.

So would 5mans still make sense? Of course, there will still be players that probably prefer 5mans to any other type of content but unfortunately with the current pace of development, we need to decide between raids and dungeons, because that’s the issue, they compete with each other in terms of resources, and while I think we can and should always try to improve on this, in both the efficiency and efficacy in which we produce content, I believe that right now most players still prefer to have more raiding content than dungeon content.

We have dailies, heroic scenarios, challenge modes, LFR, crafting, BGs, RBGs and Arenas, all of these have the ability to provide more than enough gear to be able to start raiding at least on normal mode.

There needs to be some progression too, we don’t want players to ding 90 and jump directly into ToT normal, but if you’re in a guild that has run previous raids and is just trying to fill some of the open raiding spots, you can afford to take slightly less geared players and still maintain an overall decent average raid ilvl. In the case of a new guild, you won’t have to wait too long before you step into ToT with all the options players have for gearing up that I’ve mentioned before, including previous raids.

I would also question the argument for skipping content. I could understand it if you’re close to the end of an expansion and you want to see the latest content before it “expires”, but otherwise, you’re just skipping on a lot of entertainment value. Personally, I still am quite fond of those old Kara alt-runs even when we were doing BT with mains. Having a path that you have to follow to evolve your characters is a good thing, too much skipping just devalues content even faster, content that could otherwise be a source of great entertainment. Personally it makes me a bit sad inside to see all that old content being somehow wasted away, what was once the glory and jewel of each of the previous expansions’ PvE content shines now somehow a little less bright and has devalued in a way that makes it almost obsolete, I only wish we could one day make all that content available for everyone to experience again the way it was designed to be experienced in a seamless fashion. Oh well, blues can get nostalgic and dream too you know.

I'm quite excited to see how heroic scenarios will turn out, and also for the changes being applied to the challenge mode rewards, I'm hoping to see a lot of players running both of these, and I will for sure be one of them.
