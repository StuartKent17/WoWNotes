Warlords of Draenor Developer Interviews<br>
There were a few developer interviews at the recent press events, so today we are taking a look at interviews with Alex Afrasiabi from Gameplanet (http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=V8P4xSFOj0M).<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
<br>
You won&apos;t be allowed to fly in Draenor at release, and the devs want to see how players react to this. <br>
Afrasiabi also mentions that he thinks it is possible that players could love a world with no flying. <br>
Garrisons will change the way the game plays, making it feel new.<br>
<br>
<br>
Draenor<br>
<br>
Iron Horde will be coming through the Dark Portal in the weeks coming up to the expansion release.<br>
Upon arrival to Draenor, players will go through a 45 minute experience to try and turn off the Dark Portal to save Azeroth. <br>
You will see why the enemy is so bad right right away, as well as why you must stop them.<br>
When Garrosh goes back to Draenor, he still thinks he is a great savior. He wants to show the world the might of a united Orc front.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Flying in Warlords of Draenor<br>
One of the statements from the interview above prompted some discussion on the forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1472455-Possibly-no-flying-throughout-entire-xpac) about the possibility of no flying at all in Warlords of Draenor.<br>

Hearthsteed Colors<br>
You may remember that the Hearthsteed mount was added to the game with both red and blue variations. So far, everyone has received the blue version for trying out Hearthstone (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3829-Ride-Into-Action-on-Your-Hearthsteed!). It appears the red version still may show up in the future though! <br>

Hotfix Bug<br>
You nerfed Flying Serpent Kick for FC&apos;ing but you didn&apos;t nerf Burst of Speed? <br>
This was unintentional (an unexpected side effect of a different hotfix). We&apos;re working on correcting the issue now. Once that&apos;s done, Monks should once again be able to use Roll, Chi Torpedo, and Flying Serpent Kick while carrying the flag. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/299266-you-nerfed-flying-serpent-kick-for-fcing/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/12032733378?page=4#67))<br>

Hearthsteed Issues<br>
If you have having troubles with procuring this mount, try this!<br>
<br>
1) Be sure to win 3 games of Hearthstone in PLAY or ARENA mode first! Your 3 wins can be from Casual or Ranked play. The introductory missions do not count. You&apos;ll know it&apos;s your third win because you&apos;ll get the &quot;Mount Up!&quot; quest reward notification in Hearthstone!<br>
<br>
2) Log into World of Warcraft and check your mail. No Hearthsteed to be seen? Go to the next step!<br>
<br>
3) Log out of World of Warcraft and log in to Hearthstone one more time.<br>
<br>
4) Log out of Hearthstone and log back in to World of Warcraft. Check your mail - your Hearthsteed should await!<br>

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/gb-en.png Free Character Migrations Available (EU)<br>
If you&apos;re on one of the source realms listed below, you can move your characters to one of the designated destination realms and avoid the queues&#x2014;for free!<br>
<br>
By initiating one of these transfers, you will be moving your character to a new realm and home. This is a one-time, one-way move. If you wish to move your character elsewhere, you will need to use the paid transfer service (https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/services/pct-select.html?).<br>
<br>
<br>
Silvermoon =&gt; Magtheridon / Azuremyst<br>
Kazzak / Outland / Stormscale =&gt; Auchindoun<br>
<br>
<br>
Please be aware that, due to the unpredictable nature of free transfers, we may close down any Free Character Migrations at any time and without warning if the target realm becomes full. If you plan to move with friends or your guild, we suggest that you coordinate the effort to reduce the chance of any stragglers being left behind.<br>
<br>
Early closures aside, this set of Free Character Migrations will end on Tuesday, March 18<br>
<br>
Begin a Free Character Migration now (https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/fcm/character-list.html?r=EU&amp;l=WoW1)! We recommend reviewing the FAQ (https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/free-character-migration), as it details what is or isn&apos;t allowed for transferred characters.<br>
