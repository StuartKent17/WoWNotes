Patch 3.3.3 on Live Servers This Week<br>
Patch 3.3.3 will hit the live servers this week, it&apos;s time for the super-big recap of all the changes and additions from this patch. <br>
<br>
Patch 3.3.3: Frozo The Renowned<br>
I&apos;m sure some of you noticed this in the 3.3.3 PTR patch notes:<br>
Frozo the Renowned has moved into the Dalaran Magus Commerce Exchange and will be trading your Frozen Orbs for various other trade goods.<br>
<br>
For those curious, here are the items for which you can trade your Frozen Orbs to Frozo. These each cost 1 Frozen Orb unless noted otherwise in parentheses:<br>
Crusader Orb (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/47556/crusader-orb/#tab=solditem_vendor) (6)<br>
Runed Orb (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/45087/runed-orb/#tab=solditem_vendor)(4)<br>

Patch 3.3.3 - Random Dungeons Changes<br>
Patch 3.3.3 should be deployed during the next maintenance on live servers and it&apos;s time to mention a few interesting changes to the Dungeon Finder that I forgot to report in the past weeks. Tons of minor changes have been made to make your life easier but there are two changes that will probably make you very happy. <br>
<br>
First, the patch notes mention a change to &quot;skip&quot; the introduction of Culling of Stratholme. The change doesn&apos;t sound really exciting but it&apos;s actually a huge improvement over the previous version, you can basically talk to Chromie and skip all the roleplay to jump directly to the first Scourge wave. A couple of other tweaks have also been made to make the dungeon slightly faster and I&apos;m pretty sure you won&apos;t skip it anymore. (Especially with a Deserter debuff extended to 30 minutes)<br>
<br>

<br>
The second major changes to the random dungeon system is the new vote kick system, you can now give a reason when you start a vote to kick someone. At some point it was mentioned in a blue post that the 15 minute limit before you can kick someone was gone, but it doesn&apos;t seem to be the case in the current build of the PTR. We will have to wait and see how it works on the live servers.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Patch 3.3.3 Professions Changes<br>
Patch 3.3.3 will introduce a couple of VERY interesting changes to professions. The first part of the change is obviously the removal of most of the transmutation cooldowns, it will affect most tiers of crafted items and it wouldn&apos;t be surprising to see items like Breastplate of the White Knight (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/67130/breastplate-of-the-white-knight/) drop from 4000 to 2000G at the AH. <br>
<br>
The 2nd part is also very interesting if you&apos;re looking for cheap epic gear to start running instances with your alts, all the crafted recipes from Ulduar had their reagents cost considerably lowered and you can expect to find these items for less than 1000G. <br>
<br>
Reminder<br>
Frozo the Renowned (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/40160/frozo-the-renowned/#tab=solditem_item) will let you trade Frozen Orbs for a lot of rare reagents, including Crusader/Runed Orbs and Eternal elements. <br>
<br>

Smelt Titansteel (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/55208/) no longer has a transmutation cooldown.<br>
Glacial Bag (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/56005/) now has a 7 days cooldown.<br>

<br>
Patch 3.3.3 Battlegrounds and Honor Changes<br>
Patch 3.3.3 brings a couple of changes to the Battleground system, the new system is heavily inspired from the current random dungeon system and it should be pretty easy to understand. <br>
<br>
Random Battleground and Call to Arms<br>
Call to Arms are no longer a quests and are directly integrated to the battlegrounds interface, a new &quot;Random Battleground&quot; option has been added and give you the same honor bonus as the Call To Arms, but applied to any battleground. <br>
<br>
The first time you win a Call to Arms or a Random Battleground, you gain 30 Honorable Kills worth of bonus honor and 25 Arena points.<br>
Losing the battleground doesn&apos;t remove the ability to get this bonus, you can just try again.<br>
After you won a Random Battleground or a Call To Arms for the first time of the day, the bonus is lowered to 15 Honorable Kills worth of bonus honor.<br>
You can only get the 30 HK bonus honor for a Call to Arms or a Random Battleground once in a day, the bonuses aren&apos;t &quot;stackable&quot; and both are lowered to 15 HK. (See screenshot) <br>
<br>

<br>
Honor Prices Changes / Battleground Marks Removal<br>
All the battleground marks are being removed from the game. <br>
<br>
Players will be able to exchange all their marks (AV (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/20560/alterac-valley-mark-of-honor/), AB (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/20559/arathi-basin-mark-of-honor/), EoTS (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/29024/eye-of-the-storm-mark-of-honor/), IQ (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/47395/isle-of-conquest-mark-of-honor/), SoTA (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/42425/strand-of-the-ancients-mark-of-honor/), WG (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/20558/warsong-gulch-mark-of-honor/)) for Commendation of Service (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/54637/commendation-of-service/). Each Commendation of Service (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/54637/commendation-of-service/) costs 1 mark and rewards you with 185 Honor.<br>
All the items bought with marks had their price changed and can now be bought with honor only.<br>
If you&apos;re interested in the old PvP rewards (some of them looked pretty nice), their price was also changed and it will be much easier to get them. Expect to spend 25,000 honor for a 2H weapon and 13,000 for a 1H. A full pre-BC epic PvP set will cost you 74,000 Honor. <br>
<br>
Of course some of the price changes are more interesting than the others, for example you don&apos;t have to farm marks anymore to get your PvP mounts and you can just buy them for 50,000 Honor. <br>

Patch 3.3.3 Mounts<br>
Patch 3.3.3 adds a couple of new mounts to the game. <br>
<br>
Celestial Steed (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75614/celestial-steed/)<br>
The Celestial Steed is probably the most impressive mount of his patch, it looks like a mix of Invincible (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7J3tAxFFjQ&amp;feature=related) and Algalon. I&apos;m not really sure where this mount will drop for the moment but considering how cool it looks, I wouldn&apos;t expect it to be widely available. <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Blazing Hippogryph (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74856/blazing-hippogryph/) and Wooly White Rhino (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74918/wooly-white-rhino/)<br>
Both mounts are supposed to be TCG Rewards but as you probably know, Blizzard and Upper Deck Entertainment won&apos;t be working together anymore in 2010 and the future of the WoW TCG game is unclear. The Blazing Hippogryph (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74856/blazing-hippogryph/) was supposed to be a reward of the Wrathgate TCG expansion (UDI stated that Wrathgate Booster won&apos;t go into production) and the Wooly White Rhino (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74918/wooly-white-rhino/) is currently a reward of the &quot;Icecrown&quot; TCG expansion. <br>
<br>
According to a recent announcement from Blizzard, the TCG expansions will be released later this year and nothing should really change for players on the TCG side.<br>

Crimson Deathcharger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73313/crimson-deathcharger/) / Azure Deathcharger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/39045/azure-deathcharger/)<br>
These mounts are most likely a reward of the new Icecrown Citadel Quests (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/authenticator-accounts-hacked-icc-quests-crimson-deathcharger/). The spell for the Azure Deathcharger hasn&apos;t been added to the game during PTR testing and so far you should only expect to see the Crimson version of the mount in-game. <br>

<br>
X-53 Touring Rocket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75973/x-53-touring-rocket/)<br>
Another mount from an unknown source, it looks like it could be the first multi-passenger flying mount of the game. <br>

Patch 3.3.3 Pet - Lil&apos;XT and Celestial Dragon<br>
One of the latest 3.3.3 PTR build added a new pet to the game: Lil&apos; XT (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75906/lil-xt/). We don&apos;t know what the drop location is for the moment but the name is very similar to Lil&apos; KT from the Blizzard Store and the description mentions &quot;Action Figure&quot;, it might be another pet that players can get out of the game. (But not necessarily)<br>
<br>
He looks pretty cute and has a couple of unique animations + its own voice!<br>

<br>
Also, the Celestial Dragon (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75613/celestial-dragon/) is a new mini-pet from an unknown source, he is very similar to the new Celestial Steed (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KvDDFi0Fuo) mount.<br>

New Icecrown Citadel Quests in Patch 3.3.3 [SPOILER]<br>
Patch 3.3.3 added even more quests to the Icecrown Citadel! They all seem to be part of the same questline and according to the descriptions we can assume it will start from Item #51315 (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/51315/), most likely dropped by the Lich King.<br>
<br>
Quests descriptions aren&apos;t available yet, the description text for each quest is a transcript of the sound files. <br>
We can&apos;t know for sure how it will drop, the 3 possibilities are: A drop from the Lich King in 25-Man Heroic Mode, drop from the Lich King in 10-Man Heroic Mode, Shadowmourne extra quest rewards. <br>
<br>
Thanks to Tyrsenus and the wonderful users who did most of the work in this forum thread (http://www.mmo-champion.com/general-discussions-22/%28possible-spoilers%29-arthas%27-personal-effects). <br>
<br>
Quest - Quest: Personal Property (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24914/personal-property/)<br>
Reward - Item #51316 (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/51316//) (Maybe the loot bag for the other items?)<br>
Description<br>
Bring the Sealed Chest to Highlord Darion Mograine in Icecrown Citadel.<br>
<br>
You can detect no hinges or openings on this box. Were it not for the shifting of items inside, it could easily be mistaken for solid metal. If anyone could know the method of its opening, it would be Highlord Mograine.<br>
<br>
Presumably, opening the box will contain five items, which the player will then return to their respective owners:<br>
<br>
Quest - Jaina&apos;s Locket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24916/jainas-locket/)<br>
Reward - Item #52251 (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52251//) - Might be tied to Portal: Dalaran (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73324/portal-dalaran/). (1 min cooldown)<br>
Description<br>
What&apos;s this? He... he kept it.. all this time he kept it! &lt;Cries&gt; I knew! &lt;Cries&gt; I sensed a part of him still alive... trapped... struggling. Oh Arthas! Perhaps he might someday remember from what he once was... By the Light may he at last find rest, free from the icy grip of that terrible blade!<br>
<br>
Quest - Muradin&apos;s Lament (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24917/muradins-lament/)<br>
Reward - Item #52251 (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24917/muradins-lament/) - Possibly a flavor item to transform into a Frostborn - Frostborn Illusion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73320/frostborn-illusion/) - Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/frostbornillusion.jpg)<br>
Description<br>
Oh lad, how I missed those endless days in Lordaeron, sharpening your skill with this dull blade. Forging you into a weapon meant to withstand the demands of a great destiny. Heh&#x2026; You sure put them skills to use, didn&apos;t you lad? If only I&apos;d been able to stop you that day, how different things migha&apos; been. If only I&apos;da never discovered that accursed blade. Farewell, Arthas, my brother.<br>
<br>
Quest - Sylvanas&apos; Vengeance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24918/sylvanas-vengeance/)<br>
Reward - Item #52253 (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52253//) - Possibly another flavor item, probably tied to the Lament of the Highborne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73331/lament-of-the-highborne/) spell.<br>
Description<br>
So, it is done. I had not dared to trust my senses. Too many times has the Lich King made me to be a fool. Finally, he has been made to pay for the atrocities he imposed upon my people. May Azeroth never fail to remember the horrible price we paid for our weakness, for our pride. But what now, Hero? What of those freed from his grasp but still shackled to their mortal coils? Leave me. I have much to ponder.<br>
<br>
Quest - The Lightbringer&apos;s Redemption (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24919/the-lightbringers-redemption/)<br>
Reward - Item #52252 (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52252//) - Tabard of the Lightbringer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73326/tabard-of-the-lightbringer/) - Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/tabardofthelightbringer.jpg).<br>
Description<br>
Arthas... Alas, hero of Azeroth. You give me a greater gift than you know. Long have I struggled to forgive the prince for his terrible transgressions. My soul has been wracked with unbearable anxiety, dark thoughts, distancing me from the light. I recall clearly... the gleam of pride in his eye as he stood before me, eager to defeat the enemies of the light... eager to defend his people, no matter the cost. It is this memory of Arthas that I choose to keep in my heart. I shall always be in your debt, friend. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Quest - Mograine&apos;s Reunion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24915/mograines-reunion/)<br>
Reward - Item #52200 (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52200//) (Mount!)<br>
Description<br>
Alexandros: Darion, my son. At last I am able to lay my eyes upon you again. The Lich King tormented me without end, Darion. Endlessly he sought to break my will, to force me to serve him, to bind me to his blade. Finally, when events demanded his full attention, he left me. The one memory I clung to Darion, the one thought that kept me from giving in, it was your sacrifice, my son. That again saved me from eternal peril.<br>
<br>
Darion: Father, father, I&#x2026; I feared for your sanity, father, for you, I would give my life a thousand times.<br>
<br>
The reward of this quest is most likely the Crimson Deathcharger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73313/crimson-deathcharger/) mount spell added to the game in 3.3.3. <br>
<br>
There is only one mount spell, but there are actually two new deathchargers creatures Azure Deathcharger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/39045/azure-deathcharger/) and Crimson Deathcharger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/39046/crimson-deathcharger/), we can assume that the color will change depending on the player&apos;s faction. <br>

<br>
The latest patch notes can always be found at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/<br>
<br>
General<br>
Copied Test Realm characters are not copied with their achievement history in order to better facilitate the character copy process.<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
The amount of Honor awarded for an Honorable Kill has been increased by 100% for characters of all levels. This change will effectively double the amount of Honor received from Honorable Kills, or for completing Battleground and Wintergrasp objectives; however, the amount of experience gained from completing Battleground objectives and the amount of Honor rewarded for completing each Wintergrasp quest remain unchanged.<br>
<br>
Battlegrounds<br>
<br>
&lt;ul&gt; The Random Battleground system has been added! Similar to the Random Dungeon system in the Dungeon Finder, players can now queue for a random Battleground.&lt;ul&gt; Random Battleground option can be found in the Battleground tab of the PvP frame and is only available for level 80 characters at this  If this option is selected, players may not queue for specific Battlegrounds and a random Battleground simultaneously. Similar to the Random Dungeon system, players will not know for which Battleground they are chosen when selected from the queue until they zone into the Battleground. The Random Battleground option will only allow a group size of 5 players to queue together. Bonus rewards will be offered for choosing the Random Battleground option.&lt;ul&gt; Winning a Battleground using the Random Battleground option for the first time in a day will award players with 30 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency and 25 Arena points. Winning additional Battlegrounds using the Random Battleground option after the first random win will award players with 15 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency. Losing a Battleground using the Random Battleground option will award players with 5 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.[/list] Daily Battleground quests have been removed in place of the Random Battleground option. Battlegrounds will no longer award Marks of Honor.&lt;ul&gt; Players with existing Marks of Honor can still turn them in to their respective faction&apos;s quest givers, including individual marks for those who may have more marks for one Battleground than another. Items which previously required Marks of Honor will have their costs adjusted to remove these requirements.[/list] Whenever a Battleground has the holiday bonus active, it will now be referred to as &quot;Call to Arms&quot; in the Battleground tab and Calendar. In addition, Call to Arms Battleground Honor rewards have been changed.&lt;ul&gt; Choosing a specific Battleground with the Call to Arms bonus active will yield the exact same rewards as when choosing the Random Battleground option.&lt;ul&gt; Winning a Call to Arms Battleground for the first time in a day will award players with 30 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency and 25 Arena points. Additional Call to Arms Battleground victories after the first win for a player that day will award them with 15 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency. Losing a Call to Arms Battleground will award players with 5 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency. When using the Random Battleground option, players will not receive additional rewards if the Battleground chosen is under the Call to Arms bonuses. In addition, the rewards for the first victory of the day cannot be earned more than once, regardless of whether or not it is obtained from the Random Battleground system or the Call to Arms Battleground.[/list][/list][/list][/list]<br>
<br>
Wintergrasp<br>
The internal balance system now only changes when a faction achieves 2 consecutive defenses after an initial capture of Wintergrasp, up from 1. More details can be found on our PvP Discussion forum: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=23329393344 (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/23329393344-upcoming-wintergrasp-changes.html)<br>
<br>
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br>
All weekly quests will now reset during each region&apos;s scheduled maintenance, rather than at a single global time. <br>
<br>
Culling of Stratholme<br>
Players may now skip the initial introduction dialog to this dungeon once they have completed it at least once.<br>
<br>
Icecrown Citadel<br>
Blood-Queen Lana&apos;thel: Pact of the Darkfallen now applies damage twice as often, but for half the damage. This change will make the removal of the spell a bit more responsive.<br>
Hellscream&apos;s Warsong and Strength of Wrynn now provide their bonuses to player pet health and damage, as well as the absorption amounts of Power Word: Shield and Sacred Shield.<br>
<br>
World Event Bosses<br>
Holiday bosses (such as Ahune for the Fire Festival) will now be accessible through the Dungeon Finder.<br>
Players must use the Dungeon Finder or speak to special holiday NPCs in the world to queue up and access these bosses.<br>
Upon accepting a queue for any holiday boss, the party will be ported directly to the necessary area for confronting that boss.<br>
The previous summoning criteria for these bosses have been removed. Players can queue up for and fight each World Event boss as many times as they want for any standard loot that they may drop.<br>
All rare holiday items (such as The Horseman&apos;s Reins) will have a chance of being found in holiday-themed loot troves which will drop once for each player in the party no more than once per day, in the same manner that doing the Random Dungeon daily quest will provide a specific reward the first time it is completed in a day.<br>
<br>
Classes: General<br>
Several raid buffs have had their ranges increased to 100 yards, up from 45 yards, to prevent select buffs from repeatedly getting applied and removed during highly mobile encounters. Some buffs, such as paladin auras, totems, shouts and Blood Pact are intentionally meant to have shorter ranges and remain unchanged.<br>
<br>

For additional notes on Lua and XML changes please visit the UI &amp; Macros Forum: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?sid=1&amp;amp;forumId=11114<br>

Dungeon Finder<br>
The Deserter debuff given to players who leave a dungeon prematurely when queuing via the Random Dungeon option has been increased to 30 minutes, up from 15 minutes. The cooldown for using the Random Dungeon option remains 15 minutes.<br>
The Random Dungeon cooldown is no longer displayed as a debuff. Instead, players will see the cooldown time remaining displayed in the Dungeon Finder window when Random Dungeon or Random Heroic Dungeon is selected from the pull-down.<br>
If a player in your party has the Deserter debuff, or is on cooldown from the Random Dungeon option, his or her character name will be displayed in the Dungeon Finder window listed as &quot;On Cooldown,&quot; preventing the group from queuing.<br>
Anyone in a dungeon party can now re-queue their group for a dungeon, as players will still be prompted whether or not to accept their chosen role.<br>
Players who use the Vote Kick option will now be prompted to provide a reason for kicking a party member. This reason will be presented to everyone in the party except for the person voted to be kicked.<br>
When joining as a group, more generous level requirements will be used instead of Random Dungeon level requirements so that players of different levels joining together will be eligible for a greater number of dungeons.<br>
Parties randomly created via the Dungeon Finder will always be arranged in the party interface from top to bottom in the following order: tank, healer, damage, damage, damage.<br>
If a random party is created via the Dungeon Finder and a player cannot roll Need on an item, a reason will now be provided.<br>
<br>
Quest Tracking Feature<br>
<br>
&lt;ul&gt; The Quest Tracking Objectives Frame can now be widened via the Interface Options menu. The short description for a tracked quest is now displayed on the Map in the quest pane. Quest items in a player&apos;s inventory which begin quests now each have an exclamation point overlaid on their icons to make them more easily identifiable. If a players selects Track Low Level Quests, the quest objectives will no longer appear dim on the Map, nor will the exclamation points appear dim over NPC heads or on the Mini-Map. Objectives Frame&lt;ul&gt; The Objectives Frame will now list the number of quests displayed at the top. In addition, players can now click on the word &quot;Objectives&quot; at the top of the Objectives Frame for a list of sorting and filtering options which will determine how quests are ordered. Any quests or achievements filtered or sorted out of the Objectives Frame are still being tracked and are simply hidden in this frame.&lt;ul&gt; Sorting&lt;ul&gt; Sort by most difficult quests. Sort by least difficult quests. Sort by quests closest in proximity to the player (this will automatically update as players travel around). Manual sorting: This allows players to Right-Click on each quest name in the Objectives Frame and determine in what order they should be placed.[/list] Filtering&lt;ul&gt; Toggle achievement tracking. Toggle completed quest tracking. Toggle tracking quest objectives in other zones.[/list] Players can now Shift + Click on a quest objective or check the Track Quest box on the Map to track a quest in the Objectives Frame.[/list][/list][/list]<br>
<br>
Auction House<br>
<br>
&lt;ul&gt; If the Auction House on a realm is unavailable for any reason, an alert will pop up informing players who attempt to access it.&lt;:li&gt; Players can now Right-Click to place an item in the Auction frame.&lt;:li&gt; Entire stacks of a specific item type can be placed in the Auction frame and several options have been added for choosing how to list auctions.&lt;:li&gt;&lt;ul&gt; Stack Size: If a stack of items has been added to the Auction frame, players can select the size of the stack they wish to sell. If an invalid stack size is entered (i.e. a stack of 21 Saronite Ore), the Create Auction button will be grayed out.&lt;:li&gt; Number of Stacks: In addition to selecting the size of a stack, players can select how many stacks of an item they wish to sell (i.e. if a player has a total of 43 Saronite Ore in the Auction frame, they can choose to list 2 stacks of 20, 4 stacks of 10, 8 stacks of 5, 43 stacks of 1, etc. If the number and amount of stacks listed results in a remainder, the left-over items will be placed back in the player&apos;s bags automatically).&lt;:li&gt; Stack Size and Number of Stacks are linked mathematically so that altering the variables of one may automatically calculate the amount of the other (i.e. if a player puts 20 in the Stack Size field and 43 Saronite Ore are in the Auction frame, the Number of Stacks field will change to 2 by default. If a player only wishes to sell one stack of 20 Saronite Ore, the Number of Stacks field can be manually changed to 1).&lt;:li&gt; Price: Players can now choose to input the price of an item Per Stack or Per Item by selecting either option from a pull-down. If Per Item is selected and a player is selling a stack of that item, the Auction House will multiply the selected Per Item price by the amount of that item in the stack. If Per Stack is selected, the player can enter the total price he or she wishes to charge for each stack of that item being listed.&lt;:li&gt; Auction Post Completion Bar: If multiple items or stacks of items are being listed at once by a player, a Posting completion bar will appear showing the total progress of each individual auction being listed once the Create Auction button is selected. The greater the number of individual listings being made in a single press of the Create Auction button, the longer this process will take. Players can still browse the Auction House while the Posting completion bar is in progress, but moving around will interrupt the progress, similar to moving while attempting to create multiple bandages with First Aid. Just as with creating bandages, auctions that were completed prior to the character moving or otherwise canceling the action will successfully be listed.&lt;:li&gt;[/list][/list]<br>
