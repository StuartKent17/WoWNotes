Blue Tweets<br>
Is this still a thing that will happen or is planned? http://t.co/qUYPAFlmIB<br>
yes! That happened it&apos;s in game now - if you scroll through the different face choices you can see the pose and texture change (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/647592302811021314))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Was removal of threat as an active mechanic in WoW a mistake?<br>
I tanked for a long time and I always found it fun as a tank. I don&apos;t think it was as fun for everyone depending on the tank. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/647918642982612992))<br>
<br>
I absolutely love Vashj&apos;ir, deep sea exploration that was breath taking, literally. Why the backlash? <br>
IMO the zone was too big and we never quite solved the 3D disorientation and target selection. While realistic, it wasn&apos;t awesome. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/647918993160802304))<br>

An announcement about combat changes in Knights of Fallen Empire was posted yesterday, with one of the more interesting features being Level Sync. <br>
<br>
<br>
Players will be scaled down to the target level of the planets they visit, having their stats, armor, and weapon damage reduced, but keeping all of their abilities.<br>
Players also will earn scaled experience, meaning they that if a player is level 60 and is killing level 30 mobs, they will gain experience appropriate for being a level 60.<br>
This means players can return to older content and play it closer to the intended experience, while still progressing their character. <br>

Wildstar had some very long queue times after going free to play this week, so Carbine announced they are temporarily adding more realms to handle the demand. <br>
