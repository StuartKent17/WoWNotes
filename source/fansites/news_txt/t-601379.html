Epix !<br>
I&apos;ve been slacking pretty badly on the BT/Hyjal loots list lately, I&apos;ll update it within the day, but while you wait let&apos;s check what&apos;s been added to Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com) today !<br>
As usual, a few drop locations are &quot;identified&quot; from the itemID and I could be wrong, but if it&apos;s not from the boss I listed it&apos;s probably the next/previous one anyway. I also got a new &quot;toy&quot; lately and may use it soon on items, wait &amp; see. ^^<br>
