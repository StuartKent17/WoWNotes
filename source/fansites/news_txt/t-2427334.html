Khor, Hammer of the Guardian (https://www.wowdb.com/items/163119-khor-hammer-of-the-guardian?bonusIDs=1477,4798) is now item level 120 to signify that it is a Transmog weapon.<br>

Island Expeditions<br>
<br>
Seafarer&apos;s Dubloon (https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1710-seafarers-dubloon) items may no longer be used in PvP Island Expeditions.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: We&apos;re looking for ways to use Dubloons in the future, but for the time being, we do not feel that Dubloon use makes for a good experience in a PvP setting.<br>
<br>
Demolishers and Siege Tanks have been tuned to do less damage, with longer cooldowns on several of their abilities.<br>
<br>
<br>
Missions<br>
