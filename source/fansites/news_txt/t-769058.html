This is a pre-expansion Blizzcon and we probably won&apos;t see a lot of omgawesome announcements. However, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the &quot;Cinematics: Cataclysm&quot; was the first screening of the Cataclysm cinematic, that would explain why they encrypted movies in the game files to prevent datamining. <br>
