Blue Tweets
Classes
what 3 spell abilities do you feel were spread too much? imo:1. MS 2. Pets 3. CC close with dots.
For me, 1. MS, 2. Interrupts, 3. Cast while moving. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/368445973896261632

Do you think that now that classes have similar toolkits, players fixate on small dps/hps deltas more now?
Yes. 200% used to be the "unacceptable" delta. Then it became 30%. Now maybe 10% or less. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366286379090575360

Why are warrior/DK buffs still 5 min duration? Other class buffs are always-on passives or 60 mins. There a reason?
They also provide resources so the intent is supposed to be you use them fairly frequently. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/368393111958863872
Isn't this just adding to bloat? A 5-min standard buff, even granting resources, is just another bind. Does it add flavor?
We could turn all buffs into passive like Trueshot Aura. Is that better for the game? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/368447726976921600

We know, now we are just scared that this will be nerfed. As last time you buffed swp it did not last too long.
The trick is not to view in progress patch notes as final. You can't lose something you technically never had. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367874432213073920

While I understand different healers are ok to have different reliance on spirit, how far do you think that should go?
The less Spirit users should not be able to just stack throughout stats and then outheal the more Spirit users. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367874122136571904

You have the numbers. I'm sure there's more than MM too. No reason to bring a SP vs a mage/lock in 5.2 progression though.
Mage and lock ended up being too good in 5.2. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367386113125523456

Why? Valid argument is valid by definition. Tell us what to focus on. Millions of players, use us to make your job easier.
Players as a collective are always going to want more changes than the game can handle. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366718960504274944
Would you be excited about 200 pages of patch notes for 5.4? As a player, I would find that really intimidating. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366719051638120448
And typically you can't just focus on your class. You often need to know how other classes changed. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366719132319744000
So even when arguments are good, we're often not going to make a change unless we think it's pretty important. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366719263421116416

Then why did Warlocks get such massive changes, then? Constantly hearing "Hunters are fine" from the devs gets old.
It was an experiment. Warlocks consistently among the least popular classes. Wanted to see if big changes changed that. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366713819185168384
Probably too early to tell still, but we're not sure it had much effect and we probably lost some locks over the changes. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366713913192099841
One the other hand, hunters have consistently been among the most popular, so more risk if we overhauled them. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366714043928543233
Consider we still get a fair amount of feedback that focus, ammo, min range and aspect changes were bad. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366714532384616449

Ooooo goodie!! ... Wait... Does it include any Feral stuff? You know since we're totally confused about what's going on!
No major new Feral changes in the blog. ATM we also think their damage in 5.4 is also fine. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365938560399970305

Lore said you were planning on giving Spriests and Boomkins active mitigation abilities. Where is this ability?
This was a miscomm somewhere along the line. We meant that mitigation was too high not that we wanted to swap passive for active. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365935804180213762

You had said you were getting rid of passive Dmg reduction in turn for cooldowns will balance get any? Barkskin is weak.
No, we said we were getting rid of passive damage reduction on some of the ranged specs. They felt too tanky to us. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367810260834078720
And we understand those of you playing those specs disagree. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367810374084485121

Instead of nerfing the Balance T16 4Set because we were being capped on SS procs, why not consider letting SS procs stack to N
We considered that, but it procs so fast we thought you'd never be able to burn through all the stacks. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364952064389951490

Can you actually give some insight into the Balance change and whether you will compensate? to calm the masses.
On the PTR we were seeing a rotation with almost no Starfire or Wrath usage. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367348191017971712

I'm sorry if this was already answered but was readiness removal for hunters needed for pve or pvp reasons?
In this case, both. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366278620961972224

my reply was referring to general hunter nerfs i've read about. not the idea about applying dot via arcane shot.
I just meant we're not thrilled with the idea of hunters bringing the perceived best MS if it's easy to apply from range. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364599751812984832
I don't get it. It's baked into warrior attacks why not bake it into hunter ones? what exactly is the diff?
Range. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365568814290702336
given how many distance closers you've given warriors and melee in general it's pretty easy for them to apply ms as well
Good. It was originally their ability. If anyone needs the best MS, it should be warriors. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365946562234417154

Unlikely. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365949918864609280

on the subject of mages, an you guys come up with something better mastery wise for the next xpac? Thought passive dmg was bad
What is a spec that you think has a good mastery? I ask bc some players want passive dps, while others want procy mechanics. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365949792293109760

is the reasoning for fire nerfs to force us to play another spec because you "worked so hard on frost mastery".
No. Fire's damage was just unacceptably high in our 5.4 testing. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367377754485829632
Combustion was a good thing to hit since it causes such huge swings based on perfect timing and a little luck. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367377834416672768
I don't play Fire, so I have no axe to grind. You are aware that currently combustion is doing 100% of ignite dmg though ?
Yeah, just a bug. It isn't worth delaying every PTR build until we catch every bug, or we'd release far fewer. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367808214122778624

I mean I get how insanely hard fire is to balance without killing lower ilvls. Maybe time for a redesign?

The reason paladins are so high is borked scaling. Too weak at low or no vengeance but OP at high veng. Examine.
We don't really see them weak at low V and only a problem in "I'll tank it all mode" which should be fixed now. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364610684836773888

It feels like the EF mastery nerf was intended to redirect us to SH or SS but it's ending up as a mastery nerf instead
We'd be open to buffing mastery. We don't like the gameplay of using a hot to constantly refresh it though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367374337080176640

It has felt like we've been given tools then had them arbitrarily taken away because of a vision we don't have access to
You have EF. We just thought the interaction between EF and mastery was a bit degenerate. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367376969949655040
Which is why I have a hard time with the "now paladins don't have an identity because we can't roll bubbles with hots." Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367377088296124416
My hope is that anyone who has stuck with us for very long would understand why that violated our design intent on many levels. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367377257624379393

Again we hear that EF doesn't fit the style you want for holy without saying what style you want. Help?
EF is fine to use. If every paladin uses it, it is no longer fine. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367352298457927680

I don't feel that claim holds water. We admit when we're wrong all the time. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/368398658057695232

Players argued that spriest needed buffs. Devs crunch numbers and buff spriests. Players were right.

If so, how do you know which players to listen to? You use your judgment, which is what we do. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/368444812917080064

I have no reason to doubt you. Still, 10-man is the majority of groups, and atm shadow doesn't fit well.
In 10s, I am pretty sure there are more Shadow priests raiding than Fury and Ret combined. They are fitting in somewhere. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367382832068321280
In 10s lots of Rets went Prot b/c Prot is OP w/ same gear. Look at diff in Ret representation between 10s and 25s.
Not sure that's true. We agree Prot is too good on live, but some Rets just want to be Rets. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367386550843088896

In my dreams I see SW:P buffs and castable-while-moving Mindflays. I'm so happy here in my dreams, but is it time to wake up?
SW:P is a good place to buff if we conclude they need it. Mind Flay on the move would be too good. You'd be very mobile. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365940502127841284
We could do a Spiritwalkers treatment, but really everyone with Spiritwalkers is just more class homogenization. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365940620973449218
We'd rather Shadow just be strong in other places if they're weaker on the move. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365940703408304129
Agree moving Flay is too good. Maybe turn Spike into a shadowy Scorch/Fel Flame?
Possibly, but does every caster need a Scorch analogue like every melee has a Kick clone? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365982595105816576
Overall, we're worried we have been too kind with the "but I need X ability" to the point of class over-similarity. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365982889835368448
I guess as long as you refrain from strengthening class niches people are going to ask for equal tools

So we have to be underrepresented before you consider bringing Shadow on par Single Tar. with other casters?
I was just arguing against the questionable claim that we get little Shadow feedback because they were all asked to respec. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365567145763016704
I guess because most Theorycrafters addressed you once and then said "He has the data, his move." instead of mass QQing.
Shadow vs. e.g. hunters or Elemental in 5.2. looks pretty good. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365600291065839616
And we believe the data suggests Shadow is competitive except against locks and mages, whose DPS is too high. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365600190662590464
You keep saying lock and mage dps is too high yet you do nothing to adjust that. You might aswell buff Shadow.
If we hotfix buffs to everyone else, then you can suddenly beat all the content quickly and there is no progression. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365940060639596544
If we hotfix nerfs to outlier specs, it risks a group being unable to beat a boss they previously had on farm. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365939979463045120
Obviously those are two extremes and we do make adjustments despite the risks, but we want to be careful. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365940157649657857

Neither do I. I've never said broken, just +10% undertuned vs our direct raid spot competition.
Priests looking for more competitive damage in 5.4 should be happy. The ones with long lists of mechanic redesigns will not. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365949000479817728

So its main reason why Shadow just ignored? I like shadow but you force me to reroll
If you think Shadow is horribly flawed, you're likely looking for something different out of the spec than we are. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365568166836965377
When you completely gut a spec in PvP and give no compensation, Expect a plethora of tweets and complaints.

Why play shadow when everything else has an advantage over it. Those who played it for years tell you and u brush them off.
It's one of those cry wolf deals where we hear so regularly how all 34 specs are doomed that it just becomes background noise. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365929757042413569
FWIW, the most common mistakes we see are downplaying your own spec's advantages or comparing yourself to an overpowered spec. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365929933396115459

Oh, is this like WotLK where you infamously said "Shadow is fine." yet had to give them a huge buff next patch?

what was wrong with the SW: D change? i played with it on the ptr and it made execute so smoother i almost cried of happiness

Not sure it would be Sub only, but we heard lots of feed that it was cool when Sub used it a lot. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364600211810689024
Misunderstood your post. It was interesting to utilize another finisher. Being forced 2 keep Slice/Recup up sucked
Yeah, for sure. One pitch is to parcel out Rupture, SnD and Recup, but maybe that is still too similar of a maintain X feel. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364879254690865153
How about,all specs keeps slice and rupture, but focus on adding exciting moves with short cooldowns,or limited use?
So many rogues complain about SnD maintenance that giving them an opt out would be nice. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364956951731376128

One question: Why 10 seconds on Evasion now?
We thought the <100% was too RNG you can almost count on it but not quite. But the duration at 100% felt too long with Prep. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364616156033720320

And you are happy with rogue population too, cause thay are falling down??? Changes need to hapen cause thay are outdated...
They have been dropping almost since launch. We've looked at the issue a lot, and two things seemed to hasten the decline. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364607997525237760
First, it became harder to gank someone from stealth in the world. Second, we introduced DKs. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364608115733315584
In any case, we're not sold on the idea that overhauling rogues leads to a population increase. Not sure that worked for locks. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364608281454452736

Looking at the 1st round of DPS tuning: Are you guys intending assassination to shine again in execute range? If so, thanks!
Partially, but really just Assassination was lower than intended on 5.4. I'm not sure I can explain why that is relative to 5.3. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367369914341793792

Hey, was healing on my shaman again on PTR. Could you please rethink stacking Earth Shields?! Huge QoL issue, seems outdated.
The effectiveness of healing the first part applies to any Earth Shield, not just yours. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364851984647462912

I don't get why shamans were the only class to get all nerfs and no buffs this update...I feel a tad sick right now.
You'll be fine. If that's your reaction to patch notes, you might be obsessing about patch notes a smidge too much. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367873927822860288

Then revert the healing rain change. Pretty sure that falls under the "but mah niche" buff section
The problem for Shaman was that they had big weaknesses in ranged or movement fights. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367375591126728704
We'd rather offset a weakness assuming it isn't debilitating rather than remove that weakness. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367375683518869504

Concerning Stormblast and Elemental Blast, why not give them the Colossus Smash treatment instead of affecting sustained PVE?
We were concerned about Elemental DPS being too high in PvE as well. The numbers aren't final though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367808643900522496
Im pretty sure he meant enhance. But it still seems odd when he did that coffee break thing saying enhance was fine
Sorry for the confusion, but it applies to both shaman DPS specs. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367841986645987328
Explain going from "we think shamans are fine in pve" and then nerfing them almost immediately nerf them to that extent?
More raid testing happened. I was careful to caveat in the blog that 5.4 hadn't yet shipped and nothing was set in stone. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367871857946394625

Hey GC please reassure me the Enhancement tweaks are bad data mining by MMOC ?
No, their damage was too high in both PvP and PvE. We nerfed SS largely because there have 30 different damage sources. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367372168885059585

I think the Warlock KJC flip-flop inspired this round. You guys were so set and then reverted it after outcry.
Not really. We listened to arguments and made some changes. 5.4 KJC is not 5.3 version. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366278491915825152

any chance breath does dmg? get rid of void ray? back it in as a dot into old style sflame? goes with the tier talents kinda.
If it does damage, then locks will feel like they are supposed to squeeze it into their rotation somehow. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/368448977873563648

remove heroic strike coz now specially after hamstring buff its useless , remove Op stack , stacking op is really boring.
HS may not have a role for Arms anymore. Fury and Prot use it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365930300565495808
Why the push to remove HS all the sudden? Unless you make Slam take its place, HS IS essential to rage managemt
Only for brief periods IMO. Usually it was at X gear level, you now have rage to spam HS as well as your normal rotation. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365950991004213248
We think more rage management is more fun, but we have to balance that with players who want to fill every GCD. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365951198261547008
If you are GCD limited it's hard to also be resource limited. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365951251420164097
But without HS, at those X gear levels, you'd have no way to bleed that rage. Would feel bad to sit at 100 rage all the time.
Not disagreeing. I'm saying rage management needs to be a core piece of gameplay not something you gear out of. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365953505535598594
Before the MoP rage changes, warriors were rage starved until X, then overpowered and felt understandably they had earned it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365953771651612673
But then it sucked to be a warrior before X, and sucked to be everyone else after. Not a stellar design. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365953906724966401
Due to the HR glyph, using Shield Block is defensively AND offensively best. HS is in a pretty dire spot.
We'd agree but there are several examples of this when we considered tank dps more optional so made glyphs for it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365992920655986689
The logic is that survival glyphs are mandatory, but these days tank dps is Kind of a Big Deal, so they aren't optional either. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365993068081582080

coz its not Op , or buff Ms damage , slam is not the way to make warrior good , it will hurt pvp and pve for most , you like .
It's tough with Arms PvE and PvP to keep either OP or Slam from being ignored. With more OP dmg you might not Slam at all. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365930615494803457
But if Slam does too much damage, you just save all rage for it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365930674085040130

Is it possible to just see Sunder Armor become a part of CS for 5.4? I don't think I have pushed this button all xpac.
Not for 5.4 but maybe eventually we'll just merge it with Devastate and CS. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367874251501490176

I like the concept of Meat Cleaver. It's just that Cleave has no part in our AOE rotation. Too much rage cost, too little dmg.
We could cut Cleave and just let you WW and RB. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367385904739926016

Most warriors I know don't have it on their hotbar even. Second point: Fury aoe feels clunky at best. Anything to smooth it up
Hmm. We really like Fury AE. Meat Cleaver is fun. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367368443491659777

So, how serious were you about removing Cleave? I'd think only prot warriors would complain as they actually use it.
It's an iconic spell and one warriors have had forever, but if it is superfluous, it's hard to justify. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367810519387738112

making Thunder Clap have no CD for Prot would solve everything, allow us to get agro on pack of mobs all the time
So would a no CD Challenging Shout, but we don't want to take all the skill out of tanking. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367348642740314112
you mean mocking banner.cause banner doesnt fixate big adds and bosses. again.fixate not taunt.
No, I actually meant CS. The idea is to give tanks tools and let them use them, not to make it trivial to do anything. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367374714525589506
Back when threat control was trickier, there was a place for CS. These days threat is easy. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367374830099640320
If you can't pick up every add instantly, that's okay. You'll still beat the encounter. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367374899519574016

Can I ask why, when Arms Warriors need sustained damage buffs, you buff slam and not MS/OP?
Common feed we hear is all the attacks feel about the same. We think Slam can hit harder w/out the rotation just being Slam spam. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367346498171711488
DW buff = sustained damage. BTW I've always thought OP should be free, Slam as rage dump with HS emergency rage dump
OP didn't work well as free because it let warriors ignore all rage generation but MS. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367369330758938624

Are you after a rotation where Slam is better than Overpower under Colossus Smash? Bank rage for SD so HS dies?
I wouldn't use HS much as Arms unless you need a hit ASAP for some reason or have tons of rage from e.g. Zerk stance. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367364383355043840

how do you intend Slam to function in the Arms rotation in 5.4?
It does more damage during CS, so in PvE use it then. In PvP you can use it anytime you need a big hit and have the rage. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367363686416912384
