Don't you think big reason people stuck in capitals instead of exploring world is absence of LFG and Trade channels?
In Cat? No. They had no need to chat with anyone because they could random queue for all the gear they'd need. Source 
We'd be willing to try a global LFG channel again, but I think you'd be buried in ahem anal spells and Chuck Norris jokes. Source 
you say in CAT, but all the queues for heroic dungeons and LFR etc are still here. Yes, we have more dailies.
But you can earn things like valor or charms by going out into the world. Dungeons and raids don't deliver every single reward. Source 

Disagree. CRZ puts several servers worth of griefers into one zone, causes zone disruption. leveling becomes impossible.
We aim to combine enough realms with CRZ to make each feel full. If there are a lot of folks around, that is kind of the goal. Source 
That was the intended and often real experience when more folks were leveling and the pop wasn't so skewed to max level. Source 

Are you really trying to say that having cross-server 90s camping all low level zones is the intended experience?
That wasn't what I said. I was remarking that you seemed surprised to have players attack you while leveling on a PvP server. Source 

So GC, the all-faction multi-tap is nice, but i still got an issue  Could you see a future solution?
We're not big fans of all-faction tap overall. You should be angry that a Horde tapped your mob! Source 
What about on PVE servers where that just makes it a pointless race? I want to play -with- my peers, not against them.
If you are Alliance, Horde are not your peers. At most you should consider them a tool to be used, then discarded. Source 
care to explain why we're not burning org to the ground and slaughtering orc women and children in 5.4 then?
You can be enemies without resorting to genocide. Source 

Aren't profession catch-up mechanisms against goal of "making the world feel populated"? Why visit old world if not for AH?
We want players out in the world. That doesn't have to mean high level characters in low level zones. Source 
You want to take away reasons for 90s to visit lowbie zones? Players would be missing out; an excuse like AH gets us to visit.
What we have typically seen up until now is those players just don't level up their professions. It's not worth going back. Source 

Many players hate CRZ - are you absolutely sure, game needs it?
Yes. Source 

Misc
Trivia: Kalgan single-handedly made almost all of the vanilla talent trees. Trivia: Kalgan still leads the team. Source 

why do so many long time players me included feel BC was the best xpac even though it was the least accessible?
I suspect because even basic elements of WoW still felt new and shiny then. Even the best things in life aren't immune from fatigue Source 
Players say they like a certain expansion, but what Blizzard wants to know is WHY they like that expansion?
True. But often the answer is "Those were the glory days of WoW for me," which is hard to recreate with just new content. Source 

He's worried that the Alliance in 5.4 will just be along for the ride while the Horde gets all the glory.
I understand the concern, but it's one of those no-win battles for us. Source 
Red & Blue are both certain that the other gets special treatment. But as I said, a lil' Red v Blue rivalry aint bad. Source 

with features such as LFR people have a 'log on, dailies, LFR, log off' attitude now, this is where I lost my ingame friends
Yeah it's a tough thing to solve, because that play style works very well with some people's real life commitments. Source 

Some way to regain the lost sense of server community would help. Right now we only play with guildies and random strangers.
I think that is well put especially the second sentence. Source 

even a 'history' of party members would help: "you grouped with X,Y,Z in yesterday's dungeon and X is online now"
Totally. Source 

Any chance of toning down other players spell effects on boss encounters, or having a setting for that. Can hardly see boss!
Yes. Working on it. Source 

Two things that the forum posting / tweeting community tend to overestimate: number of multiboxers, number of players interested in raiding. Source 
Not sure if it's an echo chamber effect or if posters / tweeters tend to be hardcore or what. Just an observation. Source 

Suit Up collapsed. Exodus collapsed. I've been in 3 25 mans this tier, all have collapsed. Please do something.
My understanding was that Exodus did not "collapse" from a 10 v 25 issue. Is that what you're implying? Source 
They're not collapsing from 10 vs 25 issues. Burnout is happening, less raiders are around and 10s result. Or they disband.
They put in 100s of attempts and demand multiple fully geared alts per player. That's not something most heroic raiders deal with. Source 
it was my understanding in their interview it was their own fault that type of gameplay was too much to bear.
I wasn't trying to blame them if that was the impression I gave. I think it's just the natural evolution of the competition. Source 

Curious, After we goto Argus next expac wink theres no more wow zones in lore to give us.Redoing old zones the expac future?
You don't think we can keep whipping continents out of thin air? Source 

Span and Port are diff lang. Why put them both in Chi Data Cntr? US servers there now have to deal w/ 2 lang barriers. Why?
I don't know in this case. Usually it is to have a large enough group to support matchmaking. Source 

If Players want old school: aka no lfr, flying, w/e, Is worth trying a new realm type for old school? pvp/rp/pve/"classic".
No LFR and flying wouldn't be too hard. Going back to old talents, weapon skill, old quests would be very hard. Source 

Voice com. required turns me off. Would love a challenge and not put on headphones,rand-bgs are getting there 
Yeah, that's a tough challenge for gaming in general. Typing is just really slow. Source 

Do you think you should publicly announce when bots have been banned. It will show the system works and might deter botting.
I think the head on a pike strategy can work as a deterrent. Source 

SWTOR got random groups correct. It is server based. Server based leads to accountability.
Realm based groups would have a very long queue time, especially on off-peak hours. How long are you willing to wait? Source
