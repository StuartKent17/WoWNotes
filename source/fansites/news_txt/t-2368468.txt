Mists and Warlords Raid Boss Health - Future Hotfix
Older Boss Raid Difficulty with 7.3.5 Scaling
As many players have noticed, changes to how creature health is determined in Patch 7.3.5 had a meaningful impact on some older raid content. This has been particularly noticeable in Warlords of Draenor and Mists of Pandaria raids. We’ve been discussing this topic constantly since the first threads popped up after the patch.

We want to be clear: our intention was never to greatly increase the difficulty of soloing old raid content for transmog or mount runs, but a side effect of the creature health tuning we did for leveling players. We’re currently working on a fix that will significantly reduce the health of Warlords and Mists raid bosses.

Thank you for all of your feedback and discussion on this issue. We’re sorry for the frustration, and we’re working to have you all back in there beating down those old raid bosses as soon as possible hopefully before the weekend.


Uuna Pet Quest Item Drop Rate
Uunas Doll  has a low drop rate from The Many-Faced Devourer  on Argus. It is the first piece in the puzzle to get Uuna  and was recently hotfixed to drop more often.
drop rate for Uuna needs to be buffed! i want to get in on the secret findings!
Good news! A hotfix has been deployed that significantly increases the drop rate of Uunas Doll  Join the secret hunt to save Uuna! Muffinus 


Mobile/Web Auction House Disabled in 7.3.5
With the release of Patch 7.3.5, we’ve had to disable the web and mobile versions of the Auction House, including the Auction House API used by certain third-party sites and addons. 

We’re working to re-enable it as quickly as possible.


Patch 7.3.5 Known Issues
We've identified the issue that caused some transmog appearances—such as the unique shoulders obtained from Xavius and Garrosh—to be removed from players’ collections. We have a pending resolution that will restore these appearances automatically. WarcraftDevs 

The Assassination Rogue trait "Poison Knives" was disabled last night after discovering an issue that caused it to deal more damage than intended. We're working to resolve this issue and re-enable the trait as soon as possible. WarcraftDevs 

We are continuing to investigate issues with performance in raids and are working to isolate and address them as quickly as possible. This is a top priority for us. WarcraftDevs 

We have noticed a spike of interest in our SMS Protect and Authenticator services due to our offer of 4 extra bag slots for participating players. Please note that it may take up to 30 minutes for the bag slots to unlock after these security features are added to your account, and that it may be necessary to log out and back in once this time has passed. Support 

Mimron's Head
Looks like this is just a visual bug with the dungeon journal. Mimiron's Head can still drop from Yogg with no keepers assisting you!

Lich King Encounter
Looks like this one is already identified and the team is working on it! No ETA currently. Official Forums 

Achievement Points Missing
Some players may have noticed a drop in achievement points after patch 7.3.5. This is not considered a bug, several achievements associated with Ulduar have been converted into Legacy, which no longer count for progress.


Scaling Bug - Heroic and Normal Dungeon NPC Health
Dungeon bosses and trash have noticeably less health in Heroic difficulty compared to Normal difficulty.


Burning Crusade

   

Wrath of the Lich King

   

Cataclysm

   

Mists of Pandaria

   

Warlords of Draenor

   


This does not seem to affect raid bosses as the health pools increased from normal to heroic upon testing.


   


Overwatch League Draws More than 10 Million Viewers
The first week of the Overwatch League managed to get over 10 million viewers!
OVERWATCH LEAGUE™ OPENING WEEK DRAWS MORE THAN 10 MILLION VIEWERS

Newly announced Twitch distribution deal drives an average audience per minute of 408,000 for the opening day broadcast
IRVINE, Calif.—January 17, 2018—The Overwatch League roared to life last week at the Blizzard Arena Los Angeles, with four days of intense competition between all 12 teams of the world’s first major global city-based professional esports league.

Buoyed by a newly announced two-year deal with Twitch, the Overwatch League’s exclusive worldwide [1] third-party digital broadcast partner, opening day drew an impressive average audience per minute of 408,000, and 280,000 for the week. More than 10 million viewers tuned in over the four-day period via Twitch, MLG, and Chinese streaming partners ZhanQi TV, NetEase CC, and Panda TV—not to mention the countless additional viewers at watch parties worldwide. On Twitch and MLG alone, the peak concurrent online audience of 437,000 hit during the highly anticipated day-one matchup between Dallas Fuel and Seoul Dynasty. In addition, tickets to Blizzard Arena Los Angeles were sold out for the entirety of opening week.

“We’re thrilled by the overwhelming response to the Overwatch League’s opening week of play,” said Pete Vlastelica, president and CEO of Major League Gaming MLG. “But this is only the beginning. With more than 35 million Overwatch® players, the Overwatch League has the potential to become one of the most-watched leagues—of any kind—in the world.”

“Since we announced Overwatch League at BlizzCon 2016, we’ve been eagerly awaiting the day when the global competitive Overwatch community could come together under one banner,” said Nate Nanzer, Overwatch League commissioner. “Opening week was that coming-out party—for the fans, both in-person at Blizzard Arena Los Angeles and tuned in by the millions all over the world, and for the players, whose love for the game came through crystal clear.”

“We had high expectations for the inaugural broadcast of the Overwatch League on Twitch, given our platform’s passionate fanbase for Overwatch," said Kevin Lin, COO of Twitch. "They really put on an amazing show and fans showed up en masse to support and celebrate Overwatch. Based on the response from the community, Overwatch League is off to a great start and we look forward to watching how the season progresses. This league demonstrates the power and potential of esports, and we’re thrilled to continue expanding our partnership with Blizzard.”

Viewers can tune in to catch all the action on Twitch, www.mlg.com, the MLG app on iOS and Android, www.overwatchleague.com, and the Overwatch League app, which launched last week for iOS and Android. Blizzard gamers also can get easy access to the Overwatch League via a new Overwatch League tab in the Blizzard Battle.net desktop app.

The first season of the Overwatch League runs until June, with playoffs and finals scheduled for July. For the inaugural season, all regular-season games will take place at Blizzard Arena Los Angeles, a state-of-the-art live-event venue in Burbank, California, custom-renovated for Blizzard Entertainment esports events. Fans can purchase tickets to attend matches, which will be played each Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.
