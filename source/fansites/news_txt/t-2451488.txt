Coldlight Surfrunner and Island Expedition Loot Clarifications and Updates
Any new about Coldlight Surfrunner pet from Island Expeditions?is the last pet i miss and yet 0% of player base received it,also 2nd time murloc appear on Whispering Reef,feedback will be appreciated!!
There are different Murloc tribes in Azeroth, and so far, the kind of Murlocs that could drop Coldlight Surfrunner have not appeared on Island Expeditions. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1065000911376773120

After our earlier tweet, we are working on a hotfix so that the Coldlight Surfrunner can drop when ANY murloc type is present on an Island Expedition. Furthermore, we're simplifying this entire system in Tides of Vengeance. More details on that soon. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1065080683058487297


BfA PvP Season 1 Will Not End on December 11th
As we’re now three weeks from beginning the Tides of Vengeance content update, we wanted to make it known that the current PvP Season will not be ending at that time.

We expect to end the current season in January 2019, and we will provide an exact date for that in a few weeks.
