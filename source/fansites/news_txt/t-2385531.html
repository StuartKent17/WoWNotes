Profession Leveling in Battle for Azeroth<br>
In Battle for Azeroth, some major changes are coming to the way we level professions. <br>
<br>
<br>
Each profession will now be separated into expansions and leveled separately from one another. <br>
Each expansion will have it&apos;s own leveling path for items from that expansion, similar to the Mists of Pandaria cooking ways. <br>
You can choose to go back and level older expansion crafting, or you can simply level the current expansion. <br>
This allows you to craft items with current expansion materials without needing older expansion materials to level<br>
You can still go back and level older expansion crafting skills as well. <br>
To clarify further, an example of this means that you can level your &quot;Cataclysm Tailoring&quot; by crafting Cataclysm patterns, but this doesn&apos;t stop you from progressing your &quot;Kul Tiran / Zandalari Tailoring&quot; from with the new expansion&apos;s patterns.<br>
First Aid is going away (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7414-Armory-Stats-First-Aid-Court-of-Stars-22-Solo-New-Overwatch-Hero-BfA-CE-Listing) and its patterns are being redistributed into Tailoring and Alchemy. Your First Aid crafts will have to be relearned in their respective new profession.<br>
<br>
<br>
In BfA will we have to relearn crafts from previous expansions?<br>
In Battle for Azeroth, any crafts you&#x2019;ve learned in the past will still be there and not need to be re-learned, with the exception of First Aid. Tailoring and Alchemy crafts, bandages, and anti-venoms that used to be in First Aid will have to be re-learned.(WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/976599336325754880))<br>

Season 6 Elite Ensembles<br>
I even dare assume a lot of people from this thread would be pretty pissed if they don&apos;t release it by next week or so<br>
<br>
I have faith that since they promised it will get it done either this week or next week but we will see.<br>
<br>
This is kinda why we don&apos;t like to promise or say when to expect something like this. :/ Its easy to assume that, but this would be most likely be separate from the usual end of season rewards. Just to set the proper expectation I wouldn&apos;t expect this in the next week or two. <br>
<br>
If something does change though I will update you guys (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1087794-season-6-elite-ensembles/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20761988466?page=53#1045))<br>
