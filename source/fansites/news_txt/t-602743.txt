Boubouille2007-10-20, 07:35 PMIt's worth its own news post, all the reputation requirements needed to enter heroic instances have been lowered to Honored instead of Revered.
Q: Heroic Keys now requires honored. Is it a bug or a new feature? I didn't find it on patch's notes.
A: That's intended. It was a late change so the patch notes haven't been updated to reflect it.

On a side note, the [item=22538] has been changed Lower City honored instead of Scale of Sands revered

Sunwell Plateau
Small update, Tigole seems to post tons of nice things tonight, here is an ETA for the Sunwell Plateau and Sunwell Isle.
Sunwell is coming along nicely. It will be on the PTR shortly after 2.3 goes to the live realms. We still need to perfect 2.3 a bit on the PTR.

The 5 person dungeon is complete and the 25 person raid instance is progressing nicely. There's also a cool "public" area featuring brand new daily quests called Sunwell Isle.
