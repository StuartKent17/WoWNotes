You might recall that Blizzard "reset" the Titan project back in mid 2013 http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3262-Titan-project-reset-delayed-until-2016. Mike Morhaime confirmed to Polygon http://www.polygon.com/2014/9/23/6833953/blizzard-cancels-titan-next-gen-mmo-pc today that the project is now cancelled.


The team set out to make another amazing MMO after World of Warcraft, but they didn't find the fun or passion.
Metzen said the decision to cancel Titan was excruciating, but cancelling projects has always resulted in better quality work.
Right now Blizzard doesn't want to spend time working on another MMO.
Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm helped Blizzard realize they don't have to work on giant projects.


However, it doesn't mean that the development team is no longer working on something. Multiple sources who seem to point towards a new unannounced project from Blizzard that would be codenamed Prometheus and could be another project built around a new license for Blizzard.

Keep in mind that this last bit is very much unofficial and unconfirmed.
