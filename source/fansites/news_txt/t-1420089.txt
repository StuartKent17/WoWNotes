Low Population Realms and Character Transfers
I think Blizzard arn't focused enough on this issue, surely giving characters on full realms a free transfer to a medium or low realm would be better instead of trying to shove players onto dead realms
All FCMs currently on offer are to medium/high population realms, as it was clear no one wanted to move to realms with low populations, we've been saying this for some time. Low and many medium population realms are in the process of being connected with other realms. We're proceeding as quickly as we can while making sure things continue to run smoothly and no new queues are created in the process.

It's a shame the connected realms aren't having more of an impact
Not many are connected yet, things will be different. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Dismiss Pet Change
Quick comment to clarify since I've seen this suggestion come up a lot:

could have just made RoS share a cooldown no matter which pet one has out.
We'd considered doing something like that, but there's actually major technical hurdles with the way Dismiss Pet works that make it a much bigger task than it sounds. We'd have to make some pretty scary changes to the way pets work in the underlying code, at least to be able to implement a shared cooldown on pet abilities. We may end up revisiting the idea sometime in the future, but we simply did not have time for it in the 5.4.2 development cycle. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Boss Must Die Weekly Quests
How about bringing this back for max level? Old raids are pretty dead now outside of alts LFR. Bringing this back will encourage people to use the old raids some more rather than gathering dust, especially HoF, even LFR is fairly desolate in there.

Instead of giving valor emblems of frost + triumph, which aren't really important right now due to the rep required to buy 522 gear on alts, why not give a warforged seal? or whatever is its equivalence later on.
The Gods of Warcraft are a bit busy right now working on WoD… You know, that whole thing about creating a world in 6 days? Well… maybe for a very, very tiny world, not Draenor for sure!

So, this is a pretty good idea but it's not going to happen for Mists of Pandaria. It might be something we could do later on in Warlords of Draenor though. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Warlords of Draenor
i keep going through the dark portal to get to WoD but its not working. Any ideas?
Keep trying every single day IMO, and some day hopefully not far in the future, it will suddenly work. Source 

By subtly, I mean the format - getting back to the adventure of it all. The fun of an unravelling story line.
The hope is that Warlords feels old-school without all the really old stuff that feels archaic now. Source 

Why aren't there any new races/classes in WoD? New races/classes are like the bread and butter for a new expansion
Adding a new class is very disruptive for all players and on top of that, Monks are the least played. Boost to 90 may help that. Source 
For races, there wasn't a slam dunk new race and we wanted players to be able to play their redone current races. Source 
ghost, i really hope you can reply with your opinion, i think that a new class is un-do-able. It's all been done
I think there are plenty of ideas for classes. But WoW doesn't need 30 classes so they need to be added sparingly. Source 
don't you feel like it would get ab bit repetitive? Unless new elements are introduced
But I feel like the monk did s good job of bringing fresh approaches to those mechanics. Source 
An aside, but Monks BM/WW idk MW feel exquisitely designed as far as how they feel to play right now imo. Good job!
They didn't come up with years of baggage like existing classes. Source 

In short, what was the reason for going back to the 10 lvl system vs 5 lvls we have had for cata and MOP? more content?
It feels more epic. It lets the rewards come more frequently. It unasks the whole "what happens next expansion at 100?" Source 
Previously, we felt constrained because of the desire to add new buttons every level or so. But everyone has enough buttons. Source 

Garrisons
did you guys consider making the garrison an entire zone and guild specific instead of just individual?
Our fear was only the guild leader would get to have fun. Everyone else would just show up. Source 

Professions
any chance professions could go back to what they were? ie bs = sword / axe / hammer / armor spec with unique, BoP crafts?
The problem we had back then was every plate melee felt the need to go BS to make Stunherald. Should BS be mandatory? Source 

Raid Finder
Raid finder is just in a sad place nowadays. No one I know likes it, although some people on the forums say they do.
Originally we thought some players could just have an LFR endgame instead of a raiding endgame. Source 
Our current thought is that LFR is a way to see the content and maybe some gear but not a great way to spend weeks or months. Source 


 Free Character Migrations FCM 12/12

Horde
Kazzak PvP -> Tarren Mill PvP
Kazzak PvP -> The Maelstrom PvP
Ragnaros PvP -> Tarren Mill PvP
Ragnaros PvP -> The Maelstrom PvP

Draenor PvE -> Magtheridon PvE
Outland PvP -> Burning Legion PvP
Silvermoon PvE -> Magtheridon PvE
Stormscale PvP -> Ravencrest PvP

Please note: FCMs are opened based on realm population tracking and analysis, not by request. If you’re looking for a specific migration from realm A to realm B, you should in most cases use the Character Transfer service.

Character Transfers CT
All realms follow the regular CT rules, found here:


Guild Transfer: Although Free Guild Master Realm Transfers are not possible at this time, the Free Character Migration will allow you to retain your guild membership and reputation, provided that the guild master completes a Guild Master Realm Transfer first and the faction remains the same as that of the source realm.

Please note that the FCM service can be closed at any point in time.
