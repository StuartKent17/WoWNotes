Something went a bit awry with our World Boss rotation this week, and we&apos;re aware that J&apos;im is active again. Our intent here is for these bosses to be on a more spread and even rotation so we don&apos;t have encore situations like this one with our good friend J&apos;im.<br>
<br>
We don&apos;t have any plans to change anything this time around, but going forward we will work to make sure we aren&apos;t doubling up (or more) on a particular boss week-by-week.<br>
<br>
So in other words, you guys have no actual interest in doing anything about such an obvious problem when you can just go &quot;oops our bad deal with it.&quot; <br>
Thanks for showing the community how much you (don&apos;t) care about the quality of your product.<br>
In my mind fixing it now that it&apos;s live would be a bad experience for people who have already killed him, or an even worse experience for those that didn&apos;t kill J&apos;im while he was up (if they got to kill two bosses in a week).<br>

Raid Testing Schedule - October 13-17<br>
On Thursday, October 13, and Monday, October 17, we will be conducting focused raid tests of Trial of Valor bosses.<br>
<br>
Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Mythic, of course, requires a fixed 20-player group.<br>

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.</div></div>
