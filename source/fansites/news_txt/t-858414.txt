Boubouille2011-02-25, 11:16 AMToday we'll take a look at the client strings of Patch 4.1. Assuming that everything goes as planned today new patches take time!, things should get interesting soon starting today with fun models! 

"Salamander Hunter" and Crimson Fire Hawk
The new model of Ragnaros was very popular yesterday, let's kick it up a notch with the model of Crimson Fire Hawk  and a new monster, the "Salamander Hunter" who looks a lot like Majordomo Executus 

More to come soon. 


   


Bind on Battle.net account items?
The first hint of bound to Battle.net account items appeared in this patch. 


ITEM_BIND_TO_BNETACCOUNT = "Binds to Battle.net account";
ITEM_BNETACCOUNTBOUND = "Battle.net Account Bound";



Cast on key down
This patch finally gives the possibility to cast spells on key down instead of key up, making you more awesome in raids and battlegrounds! 


ACTION_BUTTON_USE_KEY_DOWN = "Cast action keybinds on key down";
OPTION_TOOLTIP_ACTION_BUTTON_USE_KEY_DOWN = "Action button keybinds will respond on key down, rather than on key up.";



Extra regeneration stats in character sheet
More information seems to be available on your character sheet if you're a rogue, a hunter, or a Death Knight! 


STAT_ENERGY_REGEN = "Energy Regen";
STAT_ENERGY_REGEN_TOOLTIP = "Energy regenerated every second.";

Guild Recruitment
Patch 4.1 will apparently introduce the in-game guild recruitment system promised during Blizzcon! So far we don't have a lot of details on how it will work but the interface can be accessed on PTRs, we'll probably see more of it in later phases of testing.
