PvE
In many ways, H-ToV is most meant for groups that comfortably clear Heroic EN, can't/won't do Mythic, yet still want a challenge WatcherDev 

Re: recent talk of raid tuning and exploits, this blog is old and full of outdated examples, but still accurate:  WatcherDev 

Questing
the "Like the Wind" WQs are just so annoying. Latency above 50ms and it'll be impossible to complete....
We've made some adjustments to these quests to improve overall responsiveness and gameplay for players with high latency. WarcraftDevs 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Can you talk about mobility creep in games, not just League as I’m seeing games like Overwatch, WoW, Dota2 etc with like hyper agile heroes that completely dumpster the immobile one because they can just dodge any of their damage out put and dish out a fair amount of their own. Why not make everyone mobile
In my experience it keeps happening because mobility especially high-speed windowed mobility is fun. As a player, it gives you a lot of interesting decisions about initiating a fight or running away from one. You can get to where you need to be quickly or get out of what you need to get out of quickly. Movement can help band-aid some bad decisions you made a few seconds ago. I think it’s totally natural that almost every game ends up with a mobility creep problem. But then as a designer you catch yourself. You don’t want to go add mobility to every character, because that’s just admitting defeat that there aren’t more attractive mechanics out there than mobility. So you get a little stubborn because you know you’ll come up with something… someday. I also think it’s the case that even when a slow-moving character is demonstrably viable or even stronger than the fast-moving character, that players still opt for the fast-moving character. Humans like to go fast. Source 

About the PvE aspect of lots of online games, especially big MMOs, do you think that there is a window of opportunity for a competitive PvE scenario? Maybe a monetized scenario like the most financially successful PvP ones?
I think competitive PvE is a hugely unexplored space. We did live raids for awhile at Blizzcon though they were a logistical nightmare and even did a race a couple of times.

If I was working on a group-based PvE game I’m not, I would try and figure out how to make it competitive. I would try and figure out if it could be an esport. There are several sports that are compelling to view for some folks! where the opposing sides don’t directly interact much: golf, bowling, track and field, most races. Those kind of feel like the live equivalent of competitive PvE. Source
