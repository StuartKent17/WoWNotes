Hunter Pets now inherit 60% of the Hunter's Attack Power up from 33%. The buff doesn't seem to affect basic attacks,intended?
Yes. Basic attacks' damage are based on the master's AP. Odd, I know. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/528236097994625024

We don't really have a suitable art asset that we can plug in - need to make something new. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/527635588833234944

PvP
can you please explain why the candles would be removed from ruins of lordaeron especially in a LAN setting? MAP placement not rel?
We removed some candles that people complained about getting stuck on frequently. Is that what you mean? holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/527631178300272640
why remove map based skill? Why create turret classes? Is there a serious pvp meta response?
I don't agree that janky collision is map based skill. They were just annoying. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/527663294304497664

please don't force us into randoms for maximum honor. 6.0.2 was great because we got to choose BGs we liked w/o missing add. honor
If specific battlegrounds give as much honor as random battlegrounds, we end up with queue time problems. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/527872232312172544

What about a pvp equivalnt of dungeon journal that people new to pvp could read brief synopsis or basic start for the BG they're in
Yes this is something we'd like to do. Really like the Heroes loading screens. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/527934750011301888

Lore
I can't find an answer to this anywhere, how to Night Elves get their facial tattoos the process and what does each shape mean?
We've never specified anywhere in the lore, to my knowledge. In general they represent a close tie with the natural world. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/528283325967106048

Garrisons
Quick question that is VERY important. Can you have a level 3 plot on a level 2 Garrison if you have mats and blueprints? Thanks!
Nope, level 3 plots require level 3 garrison, just like needing a castle to build a gryphon roost in Warcraft. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/528219848355348481

You’ll be able to mix with fellow players, well-known fan sites, and Blizzard staff, take part in fun activities including WoW dance and costume contests, win cool prizes, have unique photo opportunities to show your WoW pride, and much more… Of course, there will also be drinks and birthday cake!
