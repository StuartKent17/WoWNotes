Hunter Pets now inherit 60% of the Hunter's Attack Power up from 33%. The buff doesn't seem to affect basic attacks,intended?
Yes. Basic attacks' damage are based on the master's AP. Odd, I know. Celestalon 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Otherwise tanks won't know it's there and could move out of it, further increasing one of the other problems with EQ
We don't really have a suitable art asset that we can plug in - need to make something new. WatcherDev 

PvP
can you please explain why the candles would be removed from ruins of lordaeron especially in a LAN setting? MAP placement not rel?
We removed some candles that people complained about getting stuck on frequently. Is that what you mean? holinka 
why remove map based skill? Why create turret classes? Is there a serious pvp meta response?
I don't agree that janky collision is map based skill. They were just annoying. holinka 

please don't force us into randoms for maximum honor. 6.0.2 was great because we got to choose BGs we liked w/o missing add. honor
If specific battlegrounds give as much honor as random battlegrounds, we end up with queue time problems. holinka 

What about a pvp equivalnt of dungeon journal that people new to pvp could read brief synopsis or basic start for the BG they're in
Yes this is something we'd like to do. Really like the Heroes loading screens. holinka 

I've been hearing Probably lies about Versatility having less DR in PvP. I just want a dang confirmation on the MS..
Versatility's benefit is the same in PvP holinka 

Lore
I can't find an answer to this anywhere, how to Night Elves get their facial tattoos the process and what does each shape mean?
We've never specified anywhere in the lore, to my knowledge. In general they represent a close tie with the natural world. DaveKosak 

World
i have a question, why have you guys removed the new racing from darkmoon?
Needs polish. I'm literally watching the legendary Pat Nagle work on it right now. He is amazing. Muffinus 

Garrisons
Quick question that is VERY important. Can you have a level 3 plot on a level 2 Garrison if you have mats and blueprints? Thanks!
Nope, level 3 plots require level 3 garrison, just like needing a castle to build a gryphon roost in Warcraft. Muffinus
