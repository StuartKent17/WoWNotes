In anticipation of the upcoming 25th anniversary of Warcraft, we&#x2019;ve partnered with GOG.COM to rerelease the real-time strategy classics that started it all&#x2014;Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans and Warcraft II Battle.net Edition, including both the original Tides of Darkness and the Beyond the Dark Portal expansion. Starting today, players can once again explore these universe-defining games as they become available digitally and DRM-free for the first time ever, exclusively on GOG.COM (https://www.gog.com/game/warcraft_bundle?utm_source=blizzard.com&amp;utm_medium=legacy&amp;utm_campaign=warcraft-blizz)!<br>
<br>
Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans takes players back to the original battle for Azeroth, challenging players to pick a side and raise an army of humans or orcs capable of bringing ruin to their enemies. Warcraft II and its expansion take the battle to the high seas with a host of naval units, and introduces more of the races that make up the Alliance and the Horde, bolstering the human and orc forces with elves, trolls, dwarves, and more.<br>
