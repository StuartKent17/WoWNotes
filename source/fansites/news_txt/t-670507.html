We have released a minor bug fix patch to version 3.2.2a. This sort of patch is very small in size, and we use them to fix specific issues that can&#x2019;t be hot-fixed. Issues addressed with this patch: <br>
<br>
Fixed an issue players were having with ESC key causing the Battleground queue window to close.<br>
Fixed an issue players were having with entering Battlegrounds while dead or in combat, while already in a Battleground.<br>
Fixed the Wintergrasp zone map so it now shows the status of all walls correctly.<br>
Fixed a crash Mac clients were experiencing with ATI driver.<br>
Fixed the performance of certain spells that have transparent components. <br>
