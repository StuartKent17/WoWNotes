Battle for Azeroth&#x2122; is in full swing, and everyone is needed on the front lines. This weekend, we&#x2019;re upgrading all inactive World of Warcraft accounts, granting returning players full access to the game* and all their characters&#x2014;including;the Battle for Azeroth trial experience, for those who don&#x2019;t own the latest expansion&#x2014;through March 24.<br>
<br>
Spread the Word!<br>
As the war in Azeroth rages on, the champions of the Horde and the Alliance look to their in-game friends for help. Whether it&#x2019;s levelling up for experience, gearing up for combat, or mounting up to see the world, World of Warcraft is always best enjoyed in groups, however big or small. If you have guildmates, friends, or family who haven&#x2019;t been in Azeroth for a while, let them know they can play for free this weekend.<br>
