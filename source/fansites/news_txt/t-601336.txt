Wowhead  was updated with new items, one of them is particularly interesting.

[Ashes of Al'ar] > Phoenix Mount !
[Nexus-Prince's Ring of Balance] > Drops from Yor 
[Shaffar's Band of Brutality] > Drops from Yor 
[Band of the Crystalline Void] > Drops from Yor 

Some of you may ask if the mount is real, it is. Who dropped it ? Nobody. The mount was given to Ezra Chatterton during his trip to Blizzard HQs. But ... who is Ezra ?

About a week ago, Tamara Chuang contacted me about this, but it was the 2.1.0 release and I couldn't really post the whole thing, and decided to send it to WoWinsider  instead thanks to them for writing this article. 
I won't cover the whole story, mostly because it's been done tons of time since the original post, and also because some people are better than me at doing this.

A proof that Blizzard isn't that bad. And also that Tigole =Jeffrey Kaplan is nice, but we all knew that already.
