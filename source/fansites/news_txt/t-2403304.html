General feeling seems to be that Legion had solid content drip, but maybe 7.1 was a little too fast. That said, is there anything you&apos;d change about the content per patch? If you could swap X for Y. I.e. &quot;7.X could have used a ___, I would have swapped that for ___.&quot; (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/998371454755291138))<br>

Which legendary is your favorite re: acquisition? We&apos;ve had a lot of them, from a hammer and sword and staff to a bow and glaive to a hammer again and an axe to a cloak etc. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/998432739173875712))<br>

Will completing the campaign with both an Alliance and Horde character be required for Pathfinder Part 1 achievement?<br>
No. In Battle for Azeroth, you&apos;ll only need to complete one of either the Horde or the Alliance campaigns to earn the Pathfinder Part 1 Achievement. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/998986215670956032))<br>

you mentioned in an interview awhile back that you guys were looking at what to do with pet stables. Any news?<br>
