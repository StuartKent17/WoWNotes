<br>
<br>
New raid encounters will be tuned with the new elixir limitation in mind. If problems are identified for existing raid encounters, as a result of this change, we will make the appropriate tuning adjustments. <br>

Edit : Shade of Aran has been hotfixed, I don&apos;t really know why it&apos;s a hotfix since it was already mentionned in the 2.0.10 patch notes (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/), but I guess it&apos;s now real. <br>
<br>
Beneficial immunity effects from abilities such as Ice Block and Divine Shield will no longer cause the Shade of Aran&apos;s explosion effect from Flame Wreath to proc when the duration has faded.<br>
