Welcome on MMO-Champion !<br>
<br>
Site is finally open and we will add more contents very soon, essentially raid strategies which are still missing (but hey ... these things take a tremendous amount of time) and also a few more things, but you should already find a bunch of useful informations. <br>
<br>
If you notice an error or a bug on the website post on the forums. You can also post if you would like to see something added to the website.<br>
<br>
Thanks to :<br>

Elone : Design, tweaking, debugging (Yeah, we had a lot of bugs.)<br>

- A few items tooltips still don&apos;t work, but clicking them should still give you proper informations about them.</div></div>
