Greetings,<br>
<br>
You may have noticed we&apos;ve been doing some updates to Alterac Valley and Isle of Conquest recently. Our goals with these changes are to both improve the gameplay experience in these battlegrounds and to also design them around a longer duration format. We feel that with the longer match length, players have more room to switch strategies in a match, change from offense to defense a few times, etc. to provide a, well, more epic experience.<br>
<br>
With that, we&apos;re looking to you to give us feedback on these changes.<br>
<br>
Here are some of the changes recently (through hotfixes, so they are very recent):<br>
<br>
Alterac Valley<br>
<br>
Increased the number of Reinforcements by 100. The NPCs health and damage will match the players level and gear, which will result in a more consistent difficulty.<br>
<br>
Isle of Conquest<br>
<br>
Increased the number of Reinforcements by 100. Increased the health of the walls significantly. Increased the damage the Siege Engine, Demolishers, Glaive Throwers and Keep Cannons deal against players. (The Seige Engine in particular will now be pretty scary!) Increased the siege damage dealt by the Siege Engine and Demolisher. (The Ram ability will deal a lot of damage in particular) The Refinery and the Quarry now generate Reinforcements more frequently. Increased the health of the &quot;bosses&quot;.<br>
<br>
We welcome your feedback! Please focus your feedback on the gameplay in the map, in particular the pacing, balance of different mechanics etc. <br>
<br>
Thank You.<br>

This Week in WoW History<br>
We&apos;re taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br>
<br>
Stormcrow<br>
In 2013 the model for a new mount appeared in the game files. The Stormcrow as theorized to be a mount either added in Patch 5.4 or in the upcoming expansion, much like the Enchanted Fey Dragon. This stormy, dark-blue mount never made it into the game, however the Solar Spiderhawk, and the Violet Spellwing ended up using the same model.<br>

Horde Chopper<br>
After the series &#x201C;Azeroth Choppers&#x201D; was complete, the votes were counted, and the winner was selected. Following up on their promise, Blizzard rewarded Horde players who logged in within a specific time window with the Horde Chopper once Warlords of Draenor was released.<br>
