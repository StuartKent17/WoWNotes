Patch 5.2 - No New Dungeons<br>
Zarhym has confirmed (https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/282622614143381504) that there are no new 5 player dungeons planned for Patch 5.2.<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
PvE<br>
Whose idea was it to remove &quot;Random Normals&quot; at max level?, and could you fire them?<br>
Not many players ran them. Most jumped into heroics as soon as they could. Why did you like them? Gearing up for heroic? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277532313682849793))<br>
<br>
LFR loot system is beyond terrible.Such a way extending content artificially by making no loot to drop.Pathetic..Just pathetic<br>
The drop rate is the same as it was in 4.3. Just a different mechanic. Gearing is intended to take some time and effort. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277537459200475137)<br>
<br>
Suggestion: For raid lockouts, just lock out rolls for loot, let people run as many raids as they want otherwise.<br>
Here&apos;s our concern: &quot;Main tank, I know you won&apos;t get loot but can you run the raid with us for the third time this week?&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276857874154672128))<br>
<br>
Do the devs think all offtanks really want to dps? I die a little inside with every new 1 tank fight.<br>
We offer mostly 2 tank fights, but with so many bosses in the game, it&apos;s going to get repetitive if they all must be. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277124757659455489))<br>
<br>
Is the plan in Mists to have raiders go through each raid and let the new ones pile up or use LFR to leapfrog tiers?<br>
Want to err on the side of the former. If you want to do 5.2 raid, you can gear up in 5.0 LFR. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276745143908966400))<br>
<br>
Any thoughts to being able to pass the ability to receive loot in LFR if you don&apos;t want/need to give others a chance at a roll<br>
That gets around the point of it being personal. Now players could beg you again. Begging was super awkward. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276509796667113472))<br>
<br>
Are you happy with tank balance in challenge modes? Most groups seem to strongly prefer a DK tank.<br>
Death Grip is really good. Shockwave is too though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276504626524737538))<br>
<br>
any reason why every weapon in terrace but Regail&apos;s Crackling Dagger (http://www.wowdb.com/search?search=crackling+dagger) is sha touched? <br>
The dagger is intended to be hard to get. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278618351314538496))<br>
<br>
Do you think shamans could get CD reset on reincarnation on raid wipes? Or at least shorter cd? QoL changes? :P<br>
Not sure we like the idea of shaman being able to die on every single attempt. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278617398318350337))<br>
<br>
In ramping up the difficulty on 10N, you now have some guilds used to clearing it for 4 years that now can&apos;t. That is not fun.<br>
You&apos;re saying that the current raid tier feels too hard on 10 normal? What bosses are problematic for your group? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278571430847868928))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Alliance get 25% buff when they control the tower in dominance offensive, but horde only get 1%. It is ridiculous.<br>
That is based on the H:A ratio of your particular server. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277213561841922051))<br>
<br>
on a general note if you can`t burst down a healer and you can`t oom a healer what are you supposed to do?<br>
You should be able to oom a healer. Our plan remains to nerf PvP healing once we feel like burst is solved. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277202796955172864))<br>
<br>
I hope you arent planning on leaving war/mage nerfs till 5.2 after hotfixing demo... would be incredibly annoying<br>
We are concerned that trinket nerfs were not sufficient in curbing mage and warrior burst. Discussing options. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277198774483439616))<br>
The nerf to PvP trinkets was pointless. You just nerfed those that didn&apos;t need it and kept burst still OP for those who did.<br>
A trinket with 5000 stats can be 20% dps during the window. That is probably too high for anyone. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277203505167609856))<br>
This was quiet dumb, 10% cooldown? Lets just go get a pve trinket. Also, you only shaved 2 - 3k off damage that still globals.<br>
You lose a lot of PvP Power (5% DPS maybe) to get the PvE trinkets, but we will take steps if those show up in PvP a lot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277225497933533184))<br>
<br>
Just your fault for genius scaling. Why would you grants stats still anyway? Whats pvp power for?<br>
PvP trinks designed years ago back when 1-2 classes had timers. Now everyone does. Burst trinkets are fine. Numbers just too high (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277213375849705472))<br>
Doesn&apos;t make sense, fine but &quot;to high&quot;. Fine is how they were before. Just admit you didnt want to effect pve.<br>
The concept of clicky trinkets in PvP is fine. The tuning of PvP trinkets giving 5000 stats is not. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277224018472468480))<br>
<br>
Seeing mixed feedback about whether all PvP damage is too high or just a few overpowered spec or abilities still. Discuss if interested. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276485425424658433))<br>
I&apos;m not sure how to fix it...but hey, I bet I could if I was getting paid for it!<br>
Fixing it is easy. Fixing it in the right way is not. It&apos;s really unfun in our opinions when you can&apos;t kill anyone. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277536101793677312))<br>
<br>
PVP Power is only marginally better than regular main stats. Thats why it wont stop PVE trinkets in this case.<br>
But look at the PvE trinkets. Your&apos;e giving up passive PvP Power for expertise. Or you can have clicky secondaries. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277238950421221376))<br>
<br>
Another Xpac which Casters R extremely dominant + warriors. They hv bttr cc, surv, damage vs. dks/rogues/rets. Caster &gt; melee<br>
In PvP? Most complaints these days are mage and warrior. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277124877465575424))<br>
<br>
Honestly though, why do you feel like mages/locks should have both blanket+interrupt in one ability? Makes no sense at all.<br>
Those two abilities are on our list as well. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276508060682424320))<br>
I&apos;m getting slightly interested in that list. If you can post a blog on some primary PvP balance concerns, awesome!<br>
Yeah, probably good water cooler fodder. I still owe y&apos;all one on alts as well. So busy... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276510306451193857))<br>
<br>
The problem is blanket silences. With the amount of burst and silences, you die before you can cast anything.<br>
Let&apos;s break that down more. Counterspell? Spell Lock? Silence? Anything else? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277538620531937280))<br>
<br>
i was wondering how you feel about removing Hard CC from the game completely.. Would it cause balance issues?<br>
We think it would cause fun issues. Knowing when to use the right CC feels smart. (Yes you can take it to extremes.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276754841597009920))<br>
<br>
What if CC worked so that there is a cast time for targets at range, but targets within melee brings it down to instant cast?<br>
We&apos;d like to shift more CCs to cast time overall. Instant anything should be rare and we&apos;ve let it get too common. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277534449212723200))<br>
<br>
Don&apos;t you think removing PVP Power would address many issues players have? Like burst and huge gap in gear between players?<br>
Players would just use the PvE weapons which have about the same DPS potential. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276775550452920321))<br>
<br>
I saw Blizzard apologise this morning. You guys need to read more ^^<br>
Yep. I&apos;ll apologize right now that we have overpowered specs in PvP when MoP launched. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276381790464262144))<br>
Mistakes happen; but beta feedback was ignored. You&apos;re still not even acting on PvP balance concerns!<br>
Sure we are. We nerfed Chaos Wave just the other day. Look at the 5.1 patch notes, and I&apos;d bet most of them are PvP nerfs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276501119964966914))<br>
<br>
Community is even making surveys for you ! Just make abilities do diff in PvP/PvE game fixed<br>
Never understood the laser focus on this. Abilities do work differently between PvE and PvP -- just look at CC durations. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276380538640670720))<br>
<br>
Please admit removing skrimish was a mistake as well and bring it back soonish :&gt;<br>
I do wish we had not removed it. As I said, not many players used it, but it&apos;s clear those players miss it dearly. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276382850385838081))<br>
<br>
That&apos;s the PVE way of thinking. No serious PVPer will ever say that it should be gear=skill let alone gear&gt;skill.<br>
WoW is an RPG and rewards that improve your character are an RPG staple. Gear is normalized for tournaments where it makes sense. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276384867883814912))<br>
<br>
Twitter: PVP is ^%^ - No, it doesn&apos;t. Forums: &lt;well written arguments&gt; - no response. Seems you tweet, because you cant forum.<br>
Not sure my posting in the forums worked. Players expected a detailed analysis of any passionate post and I don&apos;t have that time (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276385307937603584))<br>
<br>
hey there you ever going to do anything about the bots in pvp. oh wait you might avoid this question or give us the usual BS<br>
It&apos;s something we take seriously, but the solutions aren&apos;t simple. Do you have suggestions of how to catch more of them? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278574109024210945))<br>
<br>
what are your honest quick thoughts of why people think Disc pvp is weak? <br>
Because they see mostly Resto shaman. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278571556249165825))<br>
<br>
Upgradeable gear is okay for honor gear, but it shouldn&apos;t be for Conquest, as it&apos;ll take months to catch up. Thoughts?<br>
Problem with catch up (PvE or PvP) is it encourages everyone to play less. We like playing more to feel like it&apos;s worth it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277878539150315520))<br>
