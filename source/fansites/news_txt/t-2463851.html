There are some interesting lines in the latest VO. You can hear all of the Xal&apos;atath lines in the initial Patch 8.1.5 VO (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2461587-Patch-8-1-5-VO-Build-28938).<br>

<br>
Sylvanas<br>
Xal&apos;atath (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Xal%27atath,_Blade_of_the_Black_Empire), a fascinating weapon. I have heard tales of its exploits.<br>
A pit it now lies dormant. But anything that slumbers can be awakened. <br>
This blade is more than a mere dagger, it is a torch that shall light our path forward.<br>
Soon I will call upon you again champion, and together we will steer the Horde towards its destiny. <br>
<br>
War is a living thing. It writhes, it grows, twisting and turning until its final form is revealed.<br>
This war is about to shift yet again, and it will be this blade that guides our way forward.<br>
<br>
Andiun<br>
When Sylvanas Windrunner became Warchief, I knew we would not be friends...but I didn&apos;t want us to be enemies. <br>
Then came the massacre in Arathi and the burning of Teldrassil. <br>
It&apos;s clear she does not fight for Azeroth, she doesn&apos;t even fight for the Horde. She wages war upon life itself.<br>
We are so close to ending this conflict and forging a lasting peace, but if Sylvanas uncovers some new weapon that allows her to keep fighting...<br>
No, we must discover what she&apos;s after and stop whatever madness she seeks to unleash upon us. <br>
<br>
Another Old God awakened. This does not bode well. <br>
Our world suffers much as it is. The Wound in Silithus, the war.<br>
The Alliance stands on the brink of victory, of ending this conflict and bringing peace to Azeroth.<br>
Sylvanas sent her champions into that shrine for a reason, she must have discovered something that can shift the war back in her favor. <br>
Whatever that might be, she must not succeed. Be ready for me to call on you again champion, we will stop Sylvanas...once and for all.<br>
<br>
MOTHER<br>
Presence of Speaker indicates imminent threat to Azeroth. <br>
Error. Uldir facility designed for Old God experimentation and containment. Planetary rehabilitation not within operational parameters. <br>
Recommendation: Relocate MOTHER unit to Chamber of Heart facility.<br>
Waygate activation advised. Destination coordinates encoded within Heart of Azeroth.<br>
Welcome back champion, facility contamination levels minimal since successful purge of specimen G&apos;huun.<br>
Extermination of all contaminated specimens recommended. <br>
<br>
Brother Pike<br>
All my life, I&apos;ve witnessed the duality of the sea. It is both a source of life...and a force of destruction. <br>
I became a tidesage to wield the might of the depths for the good of Kul Tiras. To learn of the great darkness lurking beneath us all this time...<br>
The Old God wants us fractured, divided. I fear this war has given N&apos;Zoth (https://wow.gamepedia.com/N%27Zoth) exactly what he wants.<br>
<br>
Xal&apos;atath<br>
Hear me God of the Deep, I have brought you the Opener. The bringer of Truths. The Torch that lights the way.<br>
Honor our bargain, free me to find my own fate. <br>
A fair exchange, shadows guide you my old friend.<br>
We will meet again, I am certain of it.<br>
<br>
N&apos;Zoth<br>
Go, but the blade must remain to serve my will.<br>
I have dreamed your destiny mortal.<br>
The hour is close at hand.<br>
That which was sunken shall rise.<br>
All that were sleeping shall be awakened.<br>
Receive my gift and see all truths before you.</div></div>
