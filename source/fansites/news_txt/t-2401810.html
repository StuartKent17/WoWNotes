Blizzard recommends that you upgrade to a 64-bit operating system by July 1, 2018!<br>
When World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth&#x2122; is live, we will no longer support the World of Warcraft game client for 32-bit operating systems. The vast majority of World of Warcraft players are already running the 64-bit version of the game, and this change will allow us to focus on making the 64-bit version as stable and efficient as possible.<br>
<br>
If you are using a 32-bit operating system, you will need to upgrade to 64-bit. In most cases (as with Windows 7 through 10), you have the option to upgrade for free, but you may need to reinstall some applications. Check with your OS maker to find out how to upgrade to a 64-bit operating system and what applications will be affected.<br>
<br>
Why We&#x2019;re Retiring 32-Bit Support<br>
The memory limitations of 32-bit operating systems can impact the playability and stability of many modern games, and 64-bit operating systems have been industry standard for several years. As with past expansions, we&#x2019;re making a great many technological updates to WoW with Battle for Azeroth to further enhance the game experience, and the time is right to make this change.<br>
<br>
We recommend updating to the 64-bit version of the game before July 1, 2018, to ensure your World of Warcraft gaming experience is unaffected.</div></div>
