News have been slow lately, Blizzard posters are taking a break for the end of the year and I don't have much to write about. Hopefully there are still a bunch of interesting things to post and Tier 8 sets and Ulduar gear were at the top of my list. 

Please note that these models aren't really new, most of them have been sitting here since the beta of Wrath of the Lich King. I just didn't have the time to news them before because it actually takes some work to get everything nice and organized, that's pretty much the same with Ulduar weapons, I probably already posted some of them in the past actually but this time you've got the extra-nice high resolution screenshots. 

These items will be released with Patch 3.1, it means that everything below is still in beta phase and could be changed Reminder: This is not the next patch, the next one is 3.0.8 and will most likely be deployed on live servers in the first weeks of January. Don't jump to conclusions because something doesn't look as nice as you wanted it to be, it could even be an error from my side in some case. Wrong glows on armors or weapons, I don't think it really happened here but you can never be sure 

Druids / Paladins / Shamans / Warrior sets are not in the game files for the moment, it also seems that there isn't any texture for the male version of the rogue set. Just wait a few more weeks and we'll probably see everything on 3.1 PTRs. 

Thanks to Zorkk for the help on coding a few things. See you all in 2009!

Ulduar Weapons
Again, these files have been here for some time and we will most likely see more models added to the game with the release of the Ulduar raid dungeon. 

Note: The model of the 2-Hand mace is actually named "Aspects" instead of Ulduar, but one of the skin used on this mace is properly named "Ulduar" and we will most likely see this mace for the first time in 3.1.
