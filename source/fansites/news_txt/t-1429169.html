Karazhan Cleanup - Just a Test<br>
It looks like Dave Maldonado was just playing with (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3571-Patch-5-4-2-Karazhan-Cleanup-Blue-Tweets-Setup-of-the-Month-Blizzcon-Cosplay) &lt;span title=&quot;and our hearts&quot;&gt;Karazhan&lt;/span&gt; to try and use it as part of an event quest chain, but it didn&apos;t work out.<br>

Classes<br>
have you a general team class designer or specific teams per class?<br>
General. The class design team designs collaboratively, there&apos;s no one person in charge of each class. We all work on all classes (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408666359522807808))<br>
Do all members play all classes to at least some degree?<br>
There&apos;s not enough time in the day for us all to play all classes seriously, but I think we probably have all at least leveled every class, though not every spec (there are a lot). Personally, I could play any spec at an LFR-sufficient level, 2/3 of them at Normal-sufficient, 1/4 at Heroic-sufficient, and 1 optimally. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408676739556970496))<br>
<br>
Are there still plans to do a rework of the hunter class in order to differentiate the specs? Possibly some new resourses? #hope<br>
I don&apos;t want to set hopes too high; not even close to MoP Warlock change level. But yes, Rogue/Hunter spec differentiation up. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408437965354856448))<br>
Mainly going to try to make their rotations more distinct from each other, feel different to play. Again, NOT an overhaul. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408438092354158593))<br>
Why do you not like focus roger focus is awesome. Pls don&apos;t add combo points or mana<br>
There will not be any new resources for Rogues/Hunters. Again, not an overhaul. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408473696727093248))<br>

Maybe alter time shouldn&apos;t store the procs? One way to lessen the instants from mages. And frozen orb no longer granting FoF 1/2<br>
we like the utility of alter time more than the dps gameplay it brings. Something we&apos;re exploring for 6.0 (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408405283371618304))<br>

Are you removing stance of the fierce tiger for mistweavers/brewmasters in WoD?<br>
Yes. Mistweavers get a new Crane stance for Fistweaving, in addition to Serpent stance. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408483133827194881))<br>
Crane is healer, Serpent is dd, so why Serpent Stance is for healing and Crane&apos;s is for damage? <br>
Honestly, because we switched Mistweavers to Serpent for aesthetic reasons during MoP development (Mistweaver heals = Jade color). (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408500512284094464))<br>
Funny story: Early on, Mistweaver heals were patterned after the Crane, so many of them were red. That felt somewhat odd... (1/2) (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408500764651159552))<br>
The oddest one was Spinning Crane Kick. It was red and had feathers flying out of it. It got nicknamed &quot;Poultry Slaughter&quot;. (2/2) (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408501470531567616))<br>
Is the visual effects desisions part of the class team or the art team? or does the teams work together in this?<br>
Close collaboration between design and art. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408712619051061248))<br>
<br>
Why are monk damage formulas so much longer/more complex than other classes?<br>
They&apos;re actually extremely simple if you abstract out what we call &quot;Monk Normalized Weapon DPS&quot;. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408679202620071936))<br>
We have a standard formula for &quot;Monk Normalized Weapon DPS&quot;, which combines 2H and DW into one. Abilities just do a % of that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408679422653235200))<br>
<br>
You know my feelings on FOF =) I agree that a lower haste build works if you prioritize it though, just no upside.<br>
Suppose you had only one knob to turn on FoF: +X% Damage. How far would you turn it in order to be happy with it? (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408674288892248064))<br>
Damage isnt a problem. Its a melee channel that breaks on movement. Awkward to use with no real bonus over high haste<br>
Its not rewarding enough for its drawbacks. I&apos;m saying, if you want to solve that only by +Dmg, how much is needed? (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408675187207311360))<br>
<br>
Has there ever been talk of reworking Invoke Xuen to more of a &quot;Invoke Celestial&quot; and make the CD more spec specific?<br>
We&apos;ve discussed that, but it would just be a visual change if we ever did that. Happy with the functionality for all specs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408484887948054529))<br>
<br>
do you know if they are going to give Windwalker monks the ability to have and change stances like the DPS Warriors?<br>
Nope, no plans for Windwalkers to have any other stances. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409116325399633920))<br>
<br>
Nerfing soothing mist and giving us a moderate mana cost on demand chi generator would fix a lot of issues with monks.<br>
Mistweavers need some significant changes. The goal will be to make MW care about mana. Going to make chi gen more expensive. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409114960078184448))<br>
Also, more expensive means less frequent - doesn&apos;t that risk becoming holy power?<br>
More expensive does not mean less frequent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409137545893511168))<br>
<br>
Why does Assurance of Consequence affect Transcendence for Monks when its not that major of a cooldown like Xuen is.<br>
It&apos;s a utility cooldown, and we make Readiness affect many of those. Xuen is not, because it would unbalance the talent row. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408786604149338112))<br>
okay I get that, but why transcendence and not say touch of karma?<br>
Because that would have made it overpowered. Likely room to tune around that in WoD though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409041285945651200))<br>
the problem is it only affects fists of fury dps cd which isn&apos;t really used on cd<br>
It should be, for optimal DPS. Community doesn&apos;t follow that logic, unfortunately. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409041418519183360))<br>
(c) but can we assume when something has CD we should use it every CD cycle?<br>
It&apos;s a reasonable starting assumption, but not *always* the case. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409062665764360192))<br>
I don&apos;t know about that. We would still be using RJW on the same fights in SoO that we do today if it did change<br>
Maybe, maybe not, but it would buff 1 talent on a row, and not the others, which we prefer not to do. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408790689300766720))<br>
Readiness will be problematic. Hard to balance, hard to understand. Differs btwn specs. Which spells are affected? By how much?<br>
Same way you know how Mastery works. There&apos;s a passive in your spellbook that explains what it affects, and by how much. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409113102047649792))<br>
<br>
In this 50/50 stance, will we still &apos;care&apos; about mana? Will it be more or less expensive to hybridize?<br>
Fistweaving will not be mana free or anything. Mana cost will be roughly proportional to its total throughput. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409137082070618112))<br>
<br>
Just wondering if there are any plans to give WW monks an execute or to redesign Touch of Death because its not very good at all<br>
Unlikely. ToD is a very different type of spell from a typical execute. Extremely valuable in certain situations. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408787033474084865))<br>

With all the changes to haste breakpoints in Warlords, will Eternal Flame and Sacred Shield continue to work as on live?<br>
Eternal Flame is a HoT like any other, so the changes apply. Sacred Shield is unusual; intend will be the same, may be custom. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408666901020028928))<br>

PvE<br>
to reduce raid lag, could you change BL to +dmg instead of +haste ?<br>
Unlikely. It&apos;s so iconic. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408670310129364992))<br>
<br>
is crit supression going away in warlords?<br>
Unsure yet. Possibly. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408670187261423616))<br>

I&apos;d just like to see a tank swap mechanic that isn&apos;t taunt swap at &quot;X&quot; number of stacks<br>
We would too. Tanks alternate having fun in most fights right now. Want to make both have fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408677438017646592))<br>
that and for paladin avenger&apos;s shield procs don&apos;t exist while offtanking. Could cast sequence macro the entire rotation.<br>
Aye, for tanks, having fun generally entails actively getting punched in the face. They&apos;re weird like that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408678367659958272))<br>

PvP<br>
hello holinka, as a 2200+ multi classer, i find it very hard to cap conquest now, is there any solution to this?<br>
How many classes are we talking about? Time required to cap is too low imo. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408451595223855106))<br>
too low? I wouldnt say that at all. Can take 2-3 hours sometimes doing arenas. Have 8 toons, and thats alot...<br>
Being &quot;done&quot; with a character for the week after 2-3 hours of playtime seems low to me. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408668056026509312))<br>
Please tell me you&apos;re not getting the &quot;drill sergeant&quot; mentality that has driven off so many customers already.<br>
Not sure I understand the critique. 3 hrs of play a week sounds low, especially when compared to PvE endgame. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408670849823019009))<br>
<br>
Any words about RBG for 5 players? <br>
We&apos;re doing Group Finder instead. Prefer your group of 5 have an easier time filling out your group so you can set the tone. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408308099150143488))<br>
<br>
Do you think the flag on the back of players in arena actually makes any sense?I mean it&apos;s barely noticable,just adds to the &apos;mess&apos;<br>
Guess it&apos;s sole purpose supposed to be to show team colors, but you won&apos;t see it in combat,why not have a light beam above players?<br>
Light beam seems a bit over the top. I think those flags are an opportunity for vanity rewards though. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407730746392981504))<br>
<br>
I second this! Why are there zero balance changes this season? Bit frustrating..<br>
We&apos;ve made the change to Intervene. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407671125074661378))<br>
Can something be done to Death Knights? We are actually the worst class in PvP right now and it&apos;s not fun playing.<br>
Other side of the coin, people complain about DK damage constantly. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407691086660780032))<br>
<br>
Is there a reason why you guys haven&apos;t buffed AMS? You yourself earlier stated that it was an unintended victim of Battle Fatigue<br>
Yup definitely a tweet I&apos;d take back if I could. Prefer Battle Fatigue is universally applied to all heals/absorbs so no change. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408307872410263552))<br>
If this the plan then you will need to adjust a lot things with bf going up every season ams % heals scale down through a exp<br>
We aren&apos;t happy with how high battle fatigue and base resilience numbers are right now. We need the expansion to help reduce it. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408323064703631360))<br>
Why aren&apos;t our health values just much higher?<br>
They should be. But there are a lot of cascading effects of doing so. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408348569855201283))<br>
<br>
will the s14 &quot;Gladiator&quot; be permanent/account-wide like &quot;Hero of the Alliance&quot;? <br>
No it will not. We just changed how we distribute the rewards on the backend. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408308978288836608))<br>
<br>
As a hunter trying to kill a warrior, should I use Widow Venom to reduce his self-healing, or are those &quot;heals&quot; unaffected?<br>
Those heals are affected by Widow Venom (if they aren&apos;t something is bugged) (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408671016013942784))<br>

Hey how long have you been with Blizzard? Do you have a sword or shield yet? Did you design for other game companies before?<br>
I&apos;ve been with Blizzard for nearly 3 years (played WoW since beta). No Sword/Shield. Prior to Blizz, I programmed at Microsoft 7yr (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408668271781482496))<br>
Do you get to program and crunch numbers often? Or mostly just enter into endless meetings about design related stuff?<br>
Depends on where in the patch cycle we are. I&apos;ve done a ton of theorycrafting programming and number crunching while here. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408679716799782912))<br>
Sounds really cool, did you come from a math degree background or comp sci? Were you theorycrafting wow before joining Blizz?<br>
Preface: I respect, value, and recommend college for most people. For me, personally, it wasn&apos;t worth it. (cont...) (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408680467303387136))<br>
I started working full time with Microsoft at 16, while still doing Highschool. I applied and was accepted to UW Math, (cont.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408680810581999616))<br>
but didn&apos;t go, since I didn&apos;t want to walk away from my MS job. Again, please do not skip college because that&apos;s what I did. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408681044452196352))<br>
My path through life was rather unorthodox. And yes, I did a ton of theorycrafting before joining Blizz. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408681567125385216))<br>
Why would you leave Microsoft for Blizzard? It does not make any sense to me sir.<br>
There was a 1.5yr gap in between there. Even still, I&apos;m so much more passionate about WoW than enterprise software. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408753869322076160))<br>
<br>
Plot twist, played a Holy Priest. Where are they now?<br>
Yeah, people get the idea that the devs make their own class/spec(s) strong. Commonly harshest on ourselves; we defer to other devs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408664981022859264))<br>
