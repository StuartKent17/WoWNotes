Boubouille2008-02-27, 09:56 AMUS PTRs are now working again, EU PTRs still have a lot of authentication issues and you'll have to wait for the next build to see it fixed. If everything goes well I'll probably have the time to deal with all the things requiring an update on the site and there are a lot of them, stay tuned !

Magister's Terrace loot table update
With the PTRs partially down for the last few days, I had a little more time to work on the Magister's Terrace loot and finally decided to add Rare-quality loot to it.

Warlocks - Lifetap changes incoming
Warlocks might get a nice surprise in the next PTR Build, Lifetap is being changed again !
Some changes are going to be made to lifetap in an upcoming PTR build. Until that time I think we've got enough feedback.

Please hold your comments on this ability until the new version can be tested, then a new thread can be opened for feedback.


US Realms - Free character migration
We will be offering free character moves from selected high population realms to lower populated realms, assisting in population dispersal. The ability to move a character on the selected source realms will become available on Tuesday, February 26 at 12:00PM PST, and are scheduled to run until Tuesday, March 4 at 12:00PM PST.

In the event that a realm meets our transfer goals before the scheduled end date, the transfers to that realm will be disabled. We highly recommend that if you are planning to transfer that you do so at your earliest convenience. No characters will be eligible for these free moves once the transfers have been closed.

Once the transfers open you can begin your transfer by visiting the Character Move page located here:  

The realms chosen consist of source realms with the highest sustained queues, and destination realms with the lowest population. The numbers gathered are directly from our data, and depict the realms in most need of these transfers. We will be continuing to monitor all realms and open additional free transfers in the future where necessary.

Source A PvP - Illidan, Mal'Ganis, Sargeras, Stormreaver, Tichondrius
Destination A PvP - Vashj

Source B PvP - Arthas, Burning Blade, Mannoroth, Mug'thol, Warsong
Destination B PvP - Zuluhed, 

Source C PvE - Area 52, Arygos, Ghostlands, Hellscream, Zul'jin
Destination C PvE - Velen


Stage6 going down February on 28th
On February 25, 2008 it was announced that Stage6 will be shutting down service on February 28, 2008, if there is any video here you want to save, today is probably your last chance to do it. 

[i]"As Stage6 grew quickly and dramatically accompanied by an explosion of other sites delivering high quality video, it became clear that operating the service as a part of the larger DivX business no longer made sense. We couldn’t continue to run Stage6 and focus on our broader strategy to make it possible for anyone to enjoy high quality video on any device. So, in July of last year we announced that we were kicking off an effort to explore strategic alternatives for Stage6, which is a fancy way of saying we decided we would either have to sell it, spin it out into a private company or shut it down.

I won’t and can’t, really go into too much detail on those first two options other than to say that we tried really hard to find a way to keep Stage6 alive, either as its own private entity or by selling it to another company. Ultimately neither of those two scenarios was possible, and we made the hard decision to turn the lights off and cease operation of the service.

So that’s where we are today. After February 28, Stage6 will cease to exist as an online destination. But the larger DivX universe will continue to thrive."
