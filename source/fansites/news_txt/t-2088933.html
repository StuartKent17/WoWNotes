Blue Tweets<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
What makes Blizzard content starves its community during the long time between expansions and not just in WoW but in Starcraft 2, Diablo 3, and Hearthstone<br>
The Blizzard quality bar is really, really high. We would cancel features that were fairly far along in production because they didn&apos;t hit the appropriate polish level. We&apos;d refuse to ship to a date (clearly!) when we didn&apos;t think the content was ready. As a player, I understand it really sucks. But it&apos;s also hard to argue that the Blizzard focus on quality hasn&apos;t worked for them over the long haul.<br>
<br>
(And, no, you can&apos;t speed up that time by throwing more people at the problem - mythical man month and all that. Often the barrier was just being able to find enough qualified people on this one planet.) (Source (http://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler/answers/140877160843))<br>
