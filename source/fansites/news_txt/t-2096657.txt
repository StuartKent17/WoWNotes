Class Feedback and Solo Play
one dev plays fire mage, so that has to be uber strong, no dev plays elemental shaman so we pretend that specc doesn't exist. etc

Considering the WoW development team consists of hundreds of people, it is very likely that there is at least one person on the team playing your class and spec. I think a lot of people are misinterpreting, or even twisting, what Ornyx has said.

While the developers have their own philosophies, vision and game design in mind, they ultimately want the end product to be something that players will enjoy. This does not mean that any feedback to the contrary will be disregarded. Even from as early a stage as when we enter Friends & Family testing with our products, the products can change quite significantly based on the feedback received. However, if the changes would compromise the overall vision, then the developers may disagree with making those changes. That doesn’t mean that they don’t care for, or appreciate, the feedback.

To use the restaurant example that comes up quite a lot in this thread:
If the developers were chefs, they wouldn't want to open a restaurant serving food that they would not be willing to eat themselves. However, they are only human and sometimes a dish isn't served to perfection, a mistake gets made, or a dish needs a little bit more preparation than others. Sometimes a dish simply requires a little bit of salt…

To tie this back into the ongoing concerns about class balance, we've recently received some information about philosophy and potential changes for Outlaw Rogues and Havoc Demon Hunters.

However, if your class and/or spec isn't mentioned there it doesn't mean that we are ignoring you. We're collating all the feedback we're receiving and forwarding it on. I realise it's frustrating to be left waiting but please understand that if we receive any information we can share with you, then we will of course share it with you.

WQ´s are great, but they stop progressing at 850, Crafting is great, but it also stops progressing at 850 + it requires mythic dungeons, HC dungeons don´t offer progress, LFR doesn´t, non rated BG doesn't ...

There are so many things that don´t work, as you guys don´t put effort into them. You serve them to your playerbase in such a way, that they must get the impression, that you don´t care about them, but only your own kind - the raiders and mythic dungeon players, as this content is what you do as well and therefore put lots of effort into.
The re-design of Kara, damn it´s great, but it´s not accessible by the majority of your players, therefore they can never see how much work went into it and this is a problem.

What your team needs is a casual, who does not raid or do these dungeons, someone who is telling you every evening in the office, that he has nothing meaningful to do. I am sure this would change things to the good.
We have some new content coming in Patch 7.1 tailored toward solo-play https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/news/20324478/patch-7-1-preview-new-adventures-in-the-broken-isles as well as some changes coming to non-rated PvP https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/news/20324477/pvp-rewards-in-patch-7-1 that should make it feel more rewarding.

With the recent changes to emissary caches to give gear more in-line with rewards from World Quests, it is possible to get up to a gear level comparable to that of mythic dungeons without even setting foot in a mythic dungeon. You still have chances for those rewards to Warforge or Titanforge and be on the same level as rewards from higher difficulty Mythic Keystone dungeons. In this regard, gear is more accessible than ever before.

We've been seeing a lot of requests over the years for more organised smaller group content, this originally took the form of Challenge Modes and has since transitioned into the current Mythic Keystone system. Base mythic dungeons are fundamentally designed around a level of communication and co-operation that automatically match-made groups often lack.

Organised group content that requires commitment should have a reward that correlates to the investment required. This is why higher difficulty dungeons and raids have a more consistent chance of providing a more powerful reward when compared to hoping that the 830 World Quest reward will Titanforge up to 860+, but either way no matter which content you do, there is still a chance that you're going to get an upgrade.

Karazhan holds a special place in many players’ hearts because it's an iconic location in Warcraft lore and was one of the first truly accessible raids for players in terms of the number of players and co-ordination required, even when compared the 20 man versions of Zul'Gurub or Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj in classic WoW.

At BlizzCon, and through talking to fans, I've often heard stories of friendships and guilds that were formed and blossomed as a result of Karazhan. By making Karazhan a mythic dungeon it allows us to attempt to re-capture that spirit of Karazhan by promoting more organised, smaller group, play again.

Like I said in this thread http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17613763578?page=3#post-50, I don't think it's inherently bad for World of Warcraft to offer solo-experiences, but on the flipside I don't think it's inherently bad for the game to offer organised small group activities either. One of WoW's strengths has always been the breadth of content if offers for different playstyles.

Elemental Shaman Concerns
I've also gathered concerns from this thread among others and sent them to the development team with a round of questions on our goals/philosophy for Elemental. 

Once I hear back from them I'll share what I can. Thanks for your patience in the meantime! Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/777812-elementals-just-want-dialogue-part-2/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20749717575?page=30#587

Youre talking about giving Spriests choice in 100 Talents tier? Meanwhile literally no choice for Hunter talent trees.#LetsTalk
I believe I mentioned the lack of choice/options in the Barrage/Sidewinders rows for Marks; which others concern you? WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/787320980804890624

Raiding
Then Blizz deciding raiding was too expensive and worked to fix it. Being "Raid Ready" isn't a new thing like you suggest.
BC still had chain-potting with no one-per-combat limit; and in 2.0/2.1, elixirs stacked with flasks. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/787325269212295168
Anyway, I don't think we disagree. As said in the Q&A, if the market still looks like this in a month or so, that's a problem. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/787325460514471936

PvP
will pvp season end with 7.1 arrival?
No, Legion Season 1 will not end when 7.1 launches on Oct. 25th. https://t.co/a3P0uIo4FB holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/787299938174545920

Hidden Things
Still cant believe this community figured out Kosumoth. That was the one I thought would take the longest. What did you think of it? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787119324058128384
The first person in each region that unlocked the final Kosumoth orb had their name announced to the region. Did you notice? Was this cool? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787120872498749440

Will you guys ever do another secret based around spirit form and wandering the world dead?
I hope not Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787387417493766144

Holiday Events
Any way you could scale holiday events? Want chances at goodies, but all my alts are still 100, not the 110 needed to participate.
a very good idea, love it! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787127602406240258

Could you tell or hint us whether or not this mini pet is in the current live game? and if not, will it… https://t.co/dMCZiqYYq7
