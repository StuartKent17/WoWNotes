Discipline

Resolved an issue that caused Power Word: Barrier's damage reduction effect to not apply properly to players under various conditions.




Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios

Siege of Orgrimmar

Paragons of the Klaxxi

Melee damage from the Paragons should now be more consistent and less likely to spike.
Ka'roz the Locust's Hurl Amber ability should no longer target players that have mutated into an Amber Scorpion.
Resolved an issue where Xaril the Poisoned Mind was not using Toxic Injection on the raid as soon as he joins the fight.


Terrace of Endless Spring

Terrace of Endless Spring now only has an item level requirement of 470 to be eligible to queue on Raid Finder difficulty. The additional requirement for a character to have completed Heart of Fear first had been removed.

Blue Tweets
Character
Would love an explanation about what value you believe repair costs have, or lesser charms. Forced value much?
Repair costs make death and gold have some relevance rather than letting you ignore them. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402653088529391616
Lesser charms let players progress their character on non raid nights. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402653184759300096

Items
And just OHs? What about 2Her uses? Will they not miss with white attacks? I'd say make everyone hit 100% now to be fair.
Why? Their damage is balanced around how much hit they use today. The goal is to remove hit gearing, not to buff some melee. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408664900303466496
That wasn't intended to be trite. I'm interested in the discussion. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408665013415469056

- best wishes and thanks for you efforts. As to gearing will enchants/gems change with gear and change to off-spec?
Enchants and gems will not swap. Only Agi, Str and Int on armor and set bonuses will swap. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406875464536293376

Isnt not being able to use gear before you get other pieces worse than having to reforge your gear to be able to use it?
Overall no, because reforging can affect every piece while your scenario might affect only a couple. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402544242590879744
Now set bonuses can mess with that, which I tried to address in another recent tweet. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402544305669042176
having to work to make a piece right is fun for some. If it isn't they don't have to.
That's like saying you don't have to equip bracers though. There is too large a penalty if you don' participate. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402557925928882177

Are we going to see any changes with tier pieces? Too many classes on a token, set bonuses that feel needed so you can't break
We discuss that a lot but don't have any changes to announce. The latter particularly feels bad to me. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402540947314970624
It gets into that whole space of having gear in your bag that you aren't wearing. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402541018471354368
We've discussed smaller sets, larger sets, sets that can be made in different ways, and so on. Nothing final though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402541126285938688
And do remember, our goal is not to let players gear up as fast as possible. Many suggestions seems to have that goal. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402541238324183041

since hit and expertise are going away, what's the point of removing reforging TOO?
It would still feel mandatory but for even less of a benefit than it provides today. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402532748339863552

Strength is now just agility on plate, why not merge them?
There is benefit in knowing that if you're a DK, look for Strength as well as being able to have some items only for DK/war/pally. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405463390094503937

or will every for example Paladin T17 helm have identical secondary stats?
Yes. The variation can come from Warforged, sockets and tetiary stats. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405461260877058048
Will tier pieces inherit Warforged/socket/tertiaries from their token? Or added at turn-in?
Not sure yet. It's possible the tier pieces will have no random qualities. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405497840266268673


Russian and European Players to Meet in Battle!
The winds of change are blowing across World of Warcraft’s European Arenas and Battlegrounds. As the next step in what we started with Patch 5.4 and its changes to region-wide matchmaking, Russian and European players will soon be able to face off against each other.

Every player queuing for a Battleground or Arena will still join a team with players from realms with the same language designation – German with German, English with English, and so on. However, this change means that now a Russian-speaking team might be pitted against a team from anywhere in Europe. 

Russian players will still be able to join a cross-realm group with their RealID friends from European realms, and queue with them for Battleground and Arena matches.

And finally, so you’ll know who cut you down just as you were capping that flag – players using non-Russian clients are now able to see character names in Cyrillic.


<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/october/hotsIcon.png" style="margin-bottom:-2px; margin-right:0px; vertical-align:bottom" /> Heroes Development Team Q&A
The Heroes team did a Q&A session on Twitter yesterday. You can find a recap of the important points below:

Blizzcon

The line at Blizzcon kept getting longer and longer as time went on, which surprised the team. They had no idea it would get so much attention.
Cursed Hollow http://heroesofthestorm.gamepedia.com/Cursed_Hollow and another map without tributes were the first maps added, but most people didn't enjoy the map without tributes.
Haunted Mines http://heroesofthestorm.gamepedia.com/Haunted_Mines was a last minute addition right before Blizzcon, but the team really did a good job making it quickly. 
The Blizzcon build is just a small fraction of what the team has been experimenting with.
The team showed the talent system http://heroesofthestorm.gamepedia.com/Talents at Blizzcon, which they hope will add a lot of depth to the game. 
There will be more variants of the existing maps, as well as some new map types. 
There will be at least a few more heroes like Abathur http://heroesofthestorm.gamepedia.com/Abathur that are different and interesting to play.
Since Blizzcon, the team has been adding new skins, new maps, new heroes, new talents, a social system, custom lobbies, replay viewer, a system for rejoining games, a more competitive experience, and more. 
Some people at Blizzcon said that just jumping in to the demo was overwhelming, so a new user experience is also being worked on as well. 


Heroes and Other MOBAs

Heroes is different from a standard MOBA.

Heroes will use map design to change how you play the game. You will evaluate the map, allied heroes, enemy heroes, and then that will change what talents you want to take. This will add a lot of variation and depth. 
All of the heroes from multiple Blizzard games coming together is also something different. 
The games will also have shorter ~20 minute games, which feels better than longer and slower paced games.

Some MOBAs are hostile to new users, but Heroes will take steps to address that.

Heroes will have shorter games, which will allow new players to lose faster and be less angry at the outcome. 
There are team experience points, so your hero doesn't end up far behind everyone else. 
There aren't any kill stealing, as killing enemies is good for everyone on the team. 
Players can also take advantage of AI and training modes. 
Toxic behavior in the community is a possibility, so that will be addressed if it is an issue. 
The heroes are fun to play, even if you are losing!

Heroes has an interesting way to handle leveling:

Heroes doesn't have any gold, just shared experience for the team. 
Leveling gives you access to more talents. 
Anyone on your team that is near a kill will earn experience for the team. This allows for a lot of map objectives and cross map movement, as you can go and help someone in another lane without worrying about losing experience as long as someone is still in your lane near the fights.
Just having someone in every lane will earn the maximum experience possible. Abathur http://heroesofthestorm.gamepedia.com/Abathur can still contribute experience to his team, even if he is off by himself in a lane. 



Gameplay

The Dragon Knight on the Dragon Shire http://heroesofthestorm.gamepedia.com/Dragon_Shire will be able to kick enemy heroes far away, move very quickly, and has some cool visuals, but it has a limited duration. There are other fun map mechanics like this.
There are a few options for dealing with disconnected players. If you disconnect from a game, you will gain nothing from it, including currency. If you disconnect too often, you will earn less from future games. If you actually disconnect from a game, you can rejoin if you can reconnect. AI will take over for players that go AFK. Hopefully there won't be any incentive to disconnect with a short game. 
The Ultimate breakpoint at level 10 and Storm powers at level 20 is being discussed. People who like it say that it creates strategy, giving the team that is level 10 around 30 seconds to take advantage of this and attack or do something. The other team might back off to avoid the unbalanced fight. If the level gap is too big things may not be fun for the team that is behind, but you can outstrategize the other team even if you are behind. It hasn't been a big problem in fairly balanced games.
Some talents are more generic and shared between multiple heroes, but some will have talents that are unique to them. Abathur http://heroesofthestorm.gamepedia.com/Abathur is one example of a hero that needs unique talents. More talents will be added over time. If there are too many talents in the future, the team can scale the number back down. Some of the unique talents will have unique art as well. Sergeant Hammer will pilot the siege tank, which has different art for the Hover Siege talent.


Esports

Heroes becoming a competitive esport will be up to the players. It will have all of the tools needed, and be a competitive game, but beyond that it is up to players. The time limit will also help to keep the game competitive. 
Heroes will have an Observer mode, similar to Starcraft, as it is built on the same technology. 
A map editor will be added, but it isn't clear when it will be ready. The team is passionate about giving the community tools to make maps or mods.
Heroes is about a great gameplay experience right now, but as they continue working on the game they will take a look at the experience of watching the game. Physics on environmental objects and deaths is one fun addition they have made.


Misc

The game is being internally tested now, so beta is coming "Soon™ http://wowpedia.org/Soon" when it is ready.
Characters from Lost Vikings and other older games will be added. Almost everyone at Blizzcon was asking about Lost Vikings, so design work for characters from that game was started after Blizzcon.
Heroes will have emotes, including dancing. 
Heroes will have a Mac client.
The universes crossing over will be fun, so you could have a Demon Hunter in a Hunter skin from WoW, or Nova with a Amazon skin, or Stitches with an Infernal skin.
