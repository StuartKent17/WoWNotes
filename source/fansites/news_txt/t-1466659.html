Warlords of Draenor - Upcoming Blog Posts<br>
It looks like we will be seeing the first of the promised Warlords of Draenor updates (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/february/CelestalonsPromise.png) either today or tomorrow! The second blog post will be about healing. <br>

Warlords of Draenor Developer Tweets<br>
While preparing those blog posts, the developers have been teasing with small bits of information over the past few days.<br>
Interesting. But if they&apos;re tied to certain specs, why make them talents at all? Why not keep it streamlined?<br>
Because spec-specific talents are still talents. You still choose them over other choices. The choice may just be different.<br>
(We already do this all the time in MoP, we just don&apos;t name them differently currently) (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438867356048044032))<br>

How many do druids have, just thought of that.<br>
I think 30? The count hasn&apos;t changed since BlizzCon, I believe. (But several talents have) (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438920926512422912))<br>

There are 29 Mage talents<br>
29 implies at least one of the tiers has an irregular amount of options. Looking forward to the update!<br>
Four of the talent slots have a different talent for each spec. 17 shared + 4 spec-specific * 3 specs = 29<br>
Mage talents have received significant revision. Currently: 12 brand new, 3 existing/old spells now talents, 4 w/ major changes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438557310344916992))<br>
<br>
Please tell me combustion was removed. I beg you. I have _HATED_ it ever since it was reworked before Cata.<br>
Combustion has not been removed. It&apos;s pretty core to Fire Mage gameplay. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438145317687414785))<br>

Keep that thesaurus handy when naming new Monk abilities. If I see the word &quot;chi&quot; in another spell, I&apos;ll know you ignored it!<br>
I can tell you that there is one less &apos;Chi&apos; named spell in the talent tree now, than there was at BlizzCon. *sly grin* (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438552861845118976))<br>
<br>
Are monks losing Healing Sphere in wod?<br>
The spell to manually summon them, yes. Other spec abilities still summon them. Yes, changes will be made to account for this. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/437328504074407936))<br>
We&apos;re removing it because of the bad gameplay it provided, despite its power. Healing Sphere was spam clicking on an intended target&apos;s feet, trying to account for their movement and latency, tight hit area. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/437343817428000768))<br>

What about a couple of the Shaman abilities being removed in the ~20% ability pruning?<br>
Feral Spirits no longer have the Spirit Bite ability. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438146709588148224))<br>

Anything change about Rainstorm since the Blizzcon iteration? That one in particular seemed dull for the dps inclined among us.<br>
Condensation Totem remains. Storm Armor replaced with Shocking Lava, which increases Shock damage after Lava Burst/Lash, stacking. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438145120626434049))<br>

So are you saying that talents with spec-specific abilities will have those spec-specifics given unique names?<br>
Yes. If I&apos;m Affliction, I see Soulburn: Haunt in the left talent slot. If I&apos;m Demo, I see Demonbolt. If Destro, Charred Remains. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438871956260007936))<br>
<br>
What kind of interaction is there between Grimoire of Sup/Service/Sac Tier and Demonic Servitude?<br>
Supremacy/Service fully support Demonic Servitude. Sacrificing your Doomguard/Infernal is probably a mistake.<br>
Demonic Servitude makes your Summon Doomguard spell summon a permanent pet, instead of a temporary one.<br>
The discussion is if we still have them as CDs if we don&apos;t pick servitude. I&apos;d rather see them gone.<br>
Yes, you still have them as cooldowns if you don&apos;t pick Demonic Servitude.<br>
Demonic Servitude is intentionally simple, mostly passive, gameplay-wise. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438958320271896576))<br>

Patch 5.4.7 MMR Bug<br>
There was indeed a bug with MMR calculations when Patch 5.4.7 was first released to North American servers. We were able to isolate the bug and apply a hotfix for it before the patch was released in other regions, but unfortunately are still a small number of players on the North American ladder who were able to gain some unfairly high ratings before the hotfix could be applied to NA servers.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, we&apos;ve since been able to correct the issue, and affected players should start to see their ratings fall in line with where they should be as they continue playing matches. Furthermore, should a player choose to sit on an unfairly high rating in the hopes of earning end-of-season rewards they would not have otherwise qualified for, we&#x2019;ll be able to adjust those ratings individually. Otherwise, it&#x2019;s completely safe to continue playing as normal without fear of any upcoming actions negatively affecting your rating.<br>
<br>
We don&apos;t think this situation calls for a rating wipe. We were able to fix the bug quickly enough that only a very small number of players were affected, and those that were will see their ratings stabilize before long. Those that choose to sit on their ratings, we&apos;ll be able to correct manually, so there&apos;s no risk of long-term damage to the ladder.<br>
<br>
I totally understand why it&apos;s frustrating in the short term if you&apos;re one of the few players who were affected, and we apologize for that. We just don&apos;t think it&apos;s fair to the vast majority of unaffected players to do a wipe, when there&apos;s nothing wrong with their ratings at all.<br>

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/gb-en.png Free Character Migrations Available (EU)<br>
If you&apos;re on one of the source realms listed below, you can move your characters to one of the designated destination realms and avoid the queues&#x2014;for free!<br>
<br>
By initiating one of these transfers, you will be moving your character to a new realm and home. This is a one-time, one-way move. If you wish to move your character elsewhere, you will need to use the paid transfer service (https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/services/pct-select.html?).<br>
<br>
<br>
Draenor -&gt; Kilrogg / Stormrage<br>
Silvermoon -&gt; Kilrogg / Stormrage<br>

<br>
<br>
Please be aware that, due to the unpredictable nature of free transfers, we may close down any Free Character Migrations at any time and without warning if the target realm becomes full. If you plan to move with friends or your guild, we suggest that you coordinate the effort to reduce the chance of any stragglers being left behind.<br>
<br>
Early closures aside, this set of Free Character Migrations will end on Tuesday, March 5.<br>
<br>
Begin a Free Character Migration now (https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/fcm/character-list.html?r=EU&amp;l=WoW1)! We recommend reviewing the FAQ (https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/free-character-migration), as it details what is or isn&apos;t allowed for transferred characters.<br>
