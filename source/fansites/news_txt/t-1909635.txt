Legion - Nightfallen and Withered
We previously looked at  the Nightborne  Today we are looking at the Nightfallen and Withered. When the Nightborne are exiled, they are cut off from the Nightwell. This transforms them into the Nightfallen and eventually Withered.

Developer Communication
Question for you awesome people: Game devs get accused a lot of arrogance. How do you know when a dev is being authentically humble? OccupyGStreet 
Can't think of any 'humble' devs, but humble can be very close to 'pushover'. But if you need the opposite go find @Holinka.
Also, if someone thinks I'm arrogant because I troll people who insult me personally, I'm fine with that. holinka 
I think the community wants more admittance to poor design
One challenge there is once you admit a mistake, there can be an expectation that it will be fixed very quickly. OccupyGStreet 

Interviews Watcher with are so good because he doesn't do this. He admits mistakes and seems to know what players think.
Do you think players often claim "arrogant" when what they mean is "I disagree with your direction?" OccupyGStreet 
Yes. He is very good at not spinning things. You can trust what he says. OccupyGStreet 

My view of you changed over time aswell. Often you were seen by the community as the decider & bringer of bad news/nerfs 
I'm not a fan of the "spokesperson" policy. The more devs who communicate, the more real the whole org appears to be. OccupyGStreet 

You gave me a headache! Btw, why the focus on humble? Why not something else empathetic, informative, ...?
I don't get accused that much of lacking empathy or not sharing information. Arrogant comes up a lot so I wanted to dive into it. OccupyGStreet 

Arrogance is easier to achieve with 140 characters.
.That is true! I know I come across as flippant on Twitter because I lack characters for nuance. OccupyGStreet 

If you could guarantee "flawless" CM feedback, would you still communicate with players? And why?
Great question. I think so, just because I personally enjoy it. OccupyGStreet 
Also, no disrespect to CMs, but players probably also enjoy being able to reach devs directly. OccupyGStreet 

What if there was a better way to structure the community? Some people are much better at feedback and others dilute them
I've considered some kind of "anyone can view but invite only to post." Would that feel too velvet ropey? OccupyGStreet 

Reputation / Questing
What's your take on WoW starting zones ? For example, what would you change if you could ?
We redid Elwynn a couple of times while I was there. Emphasis was on showing a good time and telling the story, not teaching. OccupyGStreet 
I do think you end up killing tiny wildlife for a bit too long in most zones. OccupyGStreet 

Misc
success breeds arrogance. It's human nature.
It's funny because I see the opposite where I work. Success just creates greater pressure to live up to those expectations. OccupyGStreet
