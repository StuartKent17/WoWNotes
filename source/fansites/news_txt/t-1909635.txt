Legion - Nightfallen and Withered
We previously looked at http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5327-Artifact-Trait-Calculator-Fishing-Artifact-Nightborne-Gnome-Hunters-Tweets the Nightborne http://wow.gamepedia.com/Nightborne. Today we are looking at the Nightfallen and Withered. When the Nightborne are exiled, they are cut off from the Nightwell. This transforms them into the Nightfallen and eventually Withered.

Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Developer Communication
Question for you awesome people: Game devs get accused a lot of arrogance. How do you know when a dev is being authentically humble? OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667101654731259904
Can't think of any 'humble' devs, but humble can be very close to 'pushover'. But if you need the opposite go find @Holinka.
Also, if someone thinks I'm arrogant because I troll people who insult me personally, I'm fine with that. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/667496340604096512
I think the community wants more admittance to poor design
One challenge there is once you admit a mistake, there can be an expectation that it will be fixed very quickly. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667499497681891328

Interviews Watcher with are so good because he doesn't do this. He admits mistakes and seems to know what players think.
Do you think players often claim "arrogant" when what they mean is "I disagree with your direction?" OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667145459559895040
Yes. He is very good at not spinning things. You can trust what he says. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667145668608176128

My view of you changed over time aswell. Often you were seen by the community as the decider & bringer of bad news/nerfs 
I'm not a fan of the "spokesperson" policy. The more devs who communicate, the more real the whole org appears to be. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667467047152955392

You gave me a headache! Btw, why the focus on humble? Why not something else empathetic, informative, ...?
I don't get accused that much of lacking empathy or not sharing information. Arrogant comes up a lot so I wanted to dive into it. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667488409691123712

Arrogance is easier to achieve with 140 characters.
.That is true! I know I come across as flippant on Twitter because I lack characters for nuance. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667494496377004033

If you could guarantee "flawless" CM feedback, would you still communicate with players? And why?
Great question. I think so, just because I personally enjoy it. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667727075122409472
Also, no disrespect to CMs, but players probably also enjoy being able to reach devs directly. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667727256282787840

What if there was a better way to structure the community? Some people are much better at feedback and others dilute them
I've considered some kind of "anyone can view but invite only to post." Would that feel too velvet ropey? OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667868516595269633

Reputation / Questing
What's your take on WoW starting zones ? For example, what would you change if you could ?
We redid Elwynn a couple of times while I was there. Emphasis was on showing a good time and telling the story, not teaching. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/666428377239191552
I do think you end up killing tiny wildlife for a bit too long in most zones. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/666428466036764672

Misc
success breeds arrogance. It's human nature.
It's funny because I see the opposite where I work. Success just creates greater pressure to live up to those expectations. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667145296435003392
