Gladiator&apos;s Plate Legguards: Fixed a graphical display error.<br>
Fixed a bug that caused some systems to see terrain holes appear in the distance.<br>
Stackable items retrieved from mail will no longer automatically stack in your inventory. This has been disabled pending a future patch fix.<br>
Players will no longer see the flickering terrain issues that were introduced with 2.1.0 when the LOD system is enabled. <br>
<br>
I uploaded all the files on Rapidshare myself, and they all survived the jotti.org virus scan (http://virusscan.jotti.org/). You should be fine. <br>
Of course if you play on european servers, don&apos;t apply this patch yet.<br>

<br>
Small note if you don&apos;t care about what I write and installed the patch on an european version<br>
Delete wow.exe, run repair.exe, this will patch you to 2.0.0, then you&apos;ll have to install the patch to 2.1.0. Faster than reinstalling the game.</div></div>
