Boubouille2010-11-22, 08:46 AMPatch 4.0.3a most likely this week
As far as I know, Patch 4.0.3a is still supposed to be deployed this week but I'll wait a little longer before I go crazy on confirmations and super huge front page posts. 



Patch 4.0.3 Old World Changes 
What is and is not in Patch 4.0.3a 
Items removed in Patch 4.0.3a  Razzashi Hatchling isn't actually removed 
Deathy Fixed Animations  Because, for some reasons, Blizzard didn't fix it in 4.0.3 o_O



Rested XP before Cataclysm
Rested experience will be reset at launch. You will start at 0 rested. 



Cataclysm Factions Pages
I wanted to wait the release of Patch 4.0.3a before pushing the rest of the Cataclysm content to avoid confusions on what is/isn't released but I assume that factions pages won't do any hurt. This is a first draft, I might add more information before the actual release of the expansion.
