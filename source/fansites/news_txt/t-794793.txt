Boubouille2010-11-22, 08:46 AMPatch 4.0.3a most likely this week
As far as I know, Patch 4.0.3a is still supposed to be deployed this week but I'll wait a little longer before I go crazy on confirmations and super huge front page posts.

Deathy Fixed Animations http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nWXvK4Bqdg Because, for some reasons, Blizzard didn't fix it in 4.0.3 o_O



Rested XP before Cataclysm
Rested experience will be reset at launch. You will start at 0 rested. 



Cataclysm Factions Pages
I wanted to wait the release of Patch 4.0.3a before pushing the rest of the Cataclysm content to avoid confusions on what is/isn't released but I assume that factions pages won't do any hurt. This is a first draft, I might add more information before the actual release of the expansion.
