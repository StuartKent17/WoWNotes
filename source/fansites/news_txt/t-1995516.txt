Another TV spot has been released! This one has a character we haven't seen before.

Legion - Action Camera
Legion added a new camera feature with that changes the camera to focus on your target rather than always being centered on the player. 


Nameplates - Set nameplates to the normal position or under the character
Head Movement - Heavy, normal, low, and no head movement
Target Focus - Focus the camera on your target or the player.

Legion Beta - NPC Phasing
As many have confirmed, this isn't localized to Dalaran although there's likely many different ways this is breaking, it's not so much a single global issue.

We're continuing to work on this today; as our engineers find things to improve, they push out code changes, and either restart the servers completely like with a 15 minute countdown to restart or just instantly crash and restart all the instance of Dalaran running which is more instant.

This is our #1 issue on the Beta at the moment - we know it's impacting your ability to test the game in virtually all other avenues. Thanks for being patient while we work through it.

Legion World Quests
Level 1 and 2 WANTED quests have been tuned down significantly, please give them another shot and let us know what you think.

Level 3 WANTED quests currently retain their high level of difficulty, blue icon, and extra-high chance to drop good loot.

Proving Grounds
Are proving grounds still going to be a requirement in Legion?
No. The emergence of Mythic dungeons, requiring premade groups, removes the need. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/727574452418936832
Just to clarify, you won't need/have Proving grounds to queue for Heroic dungeons in #Legion ?
Correct. Proving Grounds still exist, but PG Silver wonâ€™t gate Heroic dungeons. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/727629756095586304


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Thoughts on Blizzards response to legacy servers? Did you expect it? Would you find any interest in pristine servers? Thanks!
Good on JAB for saying something publicly. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/725022310474739712

Tell me honestly, do Blizz really not have the code for old versions of WoW? Odd for a software company to not have backups.
I'm sure they do, but I don't think the idea of data security is that you restore to a 10 year old version. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/725319282985291776
I mean think about how much things like OS and server hardware has changed in 10 years. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/725319401910624256
Could they make it work? Probably. Would it be an extraordinary effort? Probably. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/725319510954102784

One of the hardest lessons in Game Design is knowing when it's appropriate to not give the player what they want.
So long as you can empathize with why they want it and not come across as if you know better than them. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/725844381790396416
Man the hilarity of you guys' tweets really never gets old. You have no clue what players want at all.
Players almost never want the same thing. That's what makes this job both hard and fun. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/726097986535591936
