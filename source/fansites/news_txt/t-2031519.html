Rygarius Leaving Blizzard<br>
Our favorite patch writing hippogryph (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Rygarius_(CM)) is leaving Blizzard (https://twitter.com/Rygarius/status/755827336700801024). We&apos;re sorry to see him go and wish him the best in the future!<br>

Master Loot &amp; Guild Master Loot<br>
Using Master Loot in 7.0 requires that you have a &quot;guild group,&quot; which is the same definition that is used for things like Guild Achievements or Guild Challenges: 80% or more of the group must belong to the guild. You can definitely bring a couple (or several, for larger raids) friends along from other servers and the like.<br>
<br>
Is the appeal of Master Loot the convenience of only one person needing to check the corpse and then assign everything out? I&apos;m a little perplexed that the reaction has been more &quot;welp, guess we can&apos;t bring our friends anymore...&quot; rather than &quot;welp, guess we can&apos;t use Master Loot as much now....&quot; I&apos;d imagine there isn&apos;t much of a real concern about ninja-looting in a group of guildmembers and friends that raid together on a regular basis, or is there?<br>
<br>
I know Personal Loot has been viewed with some skepticism by guild groups over the years. Originally it was due to the drop variance, where you could potentially get 0 or 1 items from a large-raid kill, which felt terrible. We fixed that in Warlords. But even then, being unable to trade loot around to gear up a friend, or pass an item to someone who needs it more, held back its appeal. In Legion, we&apos;ve made more major improvements to Personal Loot, most importantly including the ability to trade any item that isn&apos;t a strict Item Level upgrade to other people who participated in the kill. So if you have (or have ever gotten, post-7.0, even if you no longer have it) an ilvl 720 trinket, any trinket drop you see that&apos;s 720 or lower can be traded to others in your raid group. And you still get the benefits of &quot;smart&quot; loot (e.g. never seeing a shield drop if you don&apos;t have a shield-user in your raid). Maybe it still isn&apos;t the right fit for your group, but I&apos;d encourage people raiding Hellfire this week to give it a try - we&apos;ve love to hear feedback on how it feels, and what could still be improved. Thanks!<br>

Patch 7.0.3 - Dungeon and Raid Nerfs<br>
We&apos;ve made a few more tweaks to abilities that were unaffected by Demoralized (e.g. Wrought/Focused Chaos) because they were &quot;friendly-fire&quot; damage. Those hotfixes should now be live, and will be documented in hotfix notes later today.<br>
<br>
Raid Finder should also now be receiving a weaker form of the Demoralized debuff (many of the changes that the Normal/Heroic/Mythic version is offsetting involve things like high-end raid trinkets that aren&apos;t as commonly present in Raid Finder).<br>
<br>
That said, having seen how Normal, Heroic, and Mythic have played out over the course of the first day of the patch, raiding has been easier in some ways (many combat times are a bit faster, even if on-pull burst is slower), but harder in others (healer throughput is more stressed, old methods of handling some mechanics are no longer reproducible, etc.). That&apos;s not the intent - were definitely aiming for &quot;slightly easier&quot; across the board. We&apos;ll be increasing the magnitude of the Demoralized debuff later today, and will continue to keep an eye on content.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re also looking at introducing a form of the debuff to Warlords dungeons (Mythic especially).<br>
<br>

Patch 7.0.3 Hotfixes - July 19<br>
Here you&apos;ll find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the recently-released World of Warcraft Pre-expansion Patch. Some of the hotfixes below take effect the moment they were implemented, while others may require scheduled realm restarts to go into effect.
