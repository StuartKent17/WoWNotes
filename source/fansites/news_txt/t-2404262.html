With every expansion, our musical mages reach deep down into their souls and summon a tableau of sound to accompany your next adventure. Building upon a variety of musical themes from World of Warcraft over the years, composer Glenn Stafford has infused his magic into the new main title for Battle for Azeroth, &#x201C;Before the Storm.&#x201D; Sit back, relax, and let the music carry you into the heart of Azeroth.</div></div>
