chaud2017-11-04, 12:54 AMBlizzCon 2017 - Junkertown: The Plan - Creating a New Kind of Overwatch Animation
This is a brief summary of the second Overwatch panel!

In-Game Cinematic Panel

Teamwork: Cinematics are created as a collaboration of the IGC and the Overwatch Engine Team
A whole new engine had to be built to allow creation of cinematics
The team has about 25 members
The team incorporates multiple Blizzard game engines


Story Development

Planning started early 2017, when the map didn't exist yet
Characters: Junkrat and Roadhog
Concept art, and the Queen's Decree was given to the team
During their exile, they [Junkrat, and Roadhog] stole everything they could
Choosing the place: the gate of the town
The Hook: Junkrat just wants to light the fuse to blow stuff up
Overwatch cinematics up to this point were very empotional
The title sequence was made to feel like a fun adventure


The Pitch

The cinematic was pitched without a script or a storyboard
The whole pitch was acted out
Greenlight to continue
The storyboard was very close to the final cinematic


Nuts and Bolts of the Overwatch Engine

Needed to be able to capture images and insert assets to the engine
Buffers: images that represent data
Set the Scene: TED is a light Overwatch engine used to set scenes, use the camera, add animations
The effects system drove the capture
The Play of the Game system and Capture system was very useful
New Camera system: had to make a free movement camera
Make the game engine not optimize engine by forcing quality 11
Break apart the scene into assets so they can be manipulated
Inserting the images to the engine
The Graphics cards were not able to support Quality 11
Slowed frames down to 1 FPS
The cinematic took up 5 TB of space


Animations

The game team helps the IGC team understand the character
Play of the Games give a really good insight into the character
Reference is used to discover ideas, facial expressions and nuances
Brad passed out during one of the takes when acting for the reference
Smear Frames: makes the animation more realistic by smearing the character
Makes it easier for the eye to follow, only visible in slow motion
Jokes are added by animators sometimes


The Engine

The characters, costumes, and variations are taken from the game engine
Everything that doesn't already exists in the game has to be manually made
The mesh of the characters has to be improved, because cinematics have more detail
A rig has to be built, which is the skeleton. This gives points of articulation
Limbs: these are added separately as controls for the animatior
Junkrat alone has 78 limbs and 524 controls
There are multiple automated control that move controls together
The face has multiple animated controls to create facial expressions
Effects are hand drawn frame-by-frame
All these are then added to TED for capture


Art and Lighting

The map was in development during the cinematic development
The final map was used as a base
Ambient light: simulates sunlight in the cinematic
The characters could not be seen while the light was added
Multiple point lights are added to make characters and items pop
After lights are added, it is ran through compositing
Because the payload was not used in game, which allowed to make it much more exaggerated
A surprised Pachimari was added to the cinematic as an Easter egg
