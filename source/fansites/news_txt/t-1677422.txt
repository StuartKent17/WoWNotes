Patch 6.1 - Twitter Integration
The implementation is really slick and out of the way. If you're using Twitter it helps you share things with an in-game UI you can choose to bring up. If you don't use Twitter just don't attach a Twitter account and I don't think you'll see anything related to it. The goal isn't to start socializing everything, it's really just to make it more convenient for people that already are sharing their gameplay. If you know anything about our UI and philosophy on simplicity I think you'll have a good idea of how subdued the implementation is, but it could get fun as Addons hook in and interact with it.

Can you supply a screenshot of the feature in what I assume is a pop-up window and a screenshot of the UI WITHOUT the pop-up. Like, at a time where it won't be triggered.
I cannot as I am at home and don't have access to an internal test client. To answer what I think is your question though, the ways you bring up the UI are by typing /twitter I believe that's correct or by clicking a small "w" icon that's next to existing UI elements. There's no minimap button or popup telling you to Tweet about things.

And that is why I won't be using this feature at all. Having Addons 'hook in' on a feature that is tied to my twitter account is not one I would trust. Too much chance of Addons starting to spam up my twitter feed with their own 'subtle' or not so subtle advertising.
An addon cannot tweet something for you; you have to hit the button.


Patch 6.1 - Archaeology Progress Restoration
The development team members working on this issue believe they have now found a solution and are hoping to implement this in patch 6.1. If everything goes according to plan, the fix should merge your wiped data/artifacts etc. with your current information. If your skill level was higher before the incident, you will be boosted back up to your previous level. We will be monitoring the situation closely once patch 6.1 launches and will continue to use this thread to provide updates.


World of Warcraft 10th Anniversary Ending
The 10th anniversary celebration  is coming to an end soon. You have until Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 10 a.m. PST / Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 10:00 a.m. CET to get anything you may have missed.

If you logged in at all during the event, the Molten Corgi  would have arrived in your mail. A successful run of the 40 player Raid Finder version of Molten Core rewarded a nice Core Hound  mount. The Hatespark the Tiny  pet had a 10% drop rate and the Flames of Ragnaros  weapon enchant transmog had a 2% drop rate  Anyone that killed Ragnaros also got a spec appropriate item level 640 helm

Character / Items
so do I, i also don't mind random stats in wow on loot that isn't from raids
WoW doesn't really have "grey" items as "rewards" anymore, though. More incidental gold acquisition. Not in chests. Muffinus 
Oh man, tell that to my salvage yard. 
Haha, touché, you opted in to that one though Muffinus 
I did, it's free money, as I said I don't mind greys or whites.
They're great in some, but I don't think they're the right fit for every game. Specific items tell a better story. Muffinus 

PvP
Possible to make Ashran Que make louder sound upon popping? Tab out for 30 seconds and miss que after 1+ hours in ;_;
We'll take a look holinka 

I am also trying to be nice. If you have time, please look into fixing Ashran queues and imbalance,4 hr ques 
Ashran queues are still high priority for us. Still exploring ways to improve them. holinka 
not just queues. There is zero faction balance.
faction balance is actually forced. You can only join if there is someone on the opposite side to join at same time. holinka 

Why do some classes get additional CC via glyphs? I think that's a bad idea, e.g Glyph of Garrote/Explosive Trap.
Many of the glyphs appeared before our CC problem was so obvious. We nerfed them last expac. holinka 

Garrisons
With the inn requiring the last boss killed why not have the quest item drop off the boss as well?
most of the quest items have on-use effects to make your dungeon run feel a bit different Muffinus 

Misc
Mentioned it several times that I no longer share plans about the game on Twitter. Hit up for any announcements. holinka 
Weird statement from a pvp developer. Did you take on more than you can handle?
Nope, we just want to consolidate where information is coming from. Hard to follow 20 different devs. holinka
