Command Center Hotfix
Just to confirm, we recently applied a hotfix to change the Challenge Mission's unintentionally low reward. It now rewards 3.1 million Artifact Power at Artifact Knowledge 26.

Does this count for the people who already sent their followers on the mission when it was still at the low AP value?
If you sent your followers on the mission and it hasn't completed yet you'll receive the new, increased, amount of AP when the mission is completed.

Brewmasters in Patch 7.2.5
Continuing to iterate...

Special Delivery already fills the role of giving an offensive value to Brew charges, but not in a reliable way. Instead of the Purifying Brew -> Breath of Fire buff, we're going to try making Special Delivery reliable. If you're the type of player that dislikes Brew charges being wasted when not tanking, Special Delivery already is attractive, and we're just going to make that feel better by being reliable. 

FYI, the first datamineable PTR build likely won't have this change.

EDIT: "Reliable" meaning 100% proc chance, damage per keg reduced to compensate. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1055455-brewmasters-in-725/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753776674?page=28#559
