Boubouille2009-10-08, 09:04 AMTier 10 Armor Sets - HD Preview
Wait ... Another preview of the Tier 10 Armor Sets? Yes, and I have a pretty good reason to do it. Apparently Blizzard used low/medium-resolution textures for their preview and most of the sets really looked uglier than they actually are. Let's say this is the HD armor sets preview! 

 Death Knight - Higher resolution and 4 recolors available. Helm is still missing. 
 Druid - Higher resolution, 3 recolors available.
 Hunter - Higher resolution, 3 recolors available.
 Rogue - Not in Blizzard's preview, 3 recolors available. And found the Shoulders as well! 
 Warrior - Higher resolution, 4 recolors available.

 Druid Additional note: Blizzard used the same helm for both sets in their preview, I didn't. The model of this helm is kinda bugged at the moment and only supports one texture directly hardcoded in the .m2 file. I just decided to fix it and make sure that the colors of the helms match the armors, I'm not sure if what we saw in Blizzard's preview is a design choice or a bug.
