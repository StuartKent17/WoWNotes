Wait ... Another preview of the Tier 10 Armor Sets? Yes, and I have a pretty good reason to do it. Apparently Blizzard used low/medium-resolution textures for their preview and most of the sets really looked uglier than they actually are. Let's say this is the HD armor sets preview! 

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight - Higher resolution and 4 recolors available. Helm is still missing. 
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid - Higher resolution, 3 recolors available.
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter - Higher resolution, 3 recolors available.
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue - Not in Blizzard's preview, 3 recolors available. And found the Shoulders as well! 
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior - Higher resolution, 4 recolors available.

The model of this helm is kinda bugged at the moment and only supports one texture directly hardcoded in the .m2 file. I just decided to fix it and make sure that the colors of the helms match the armors, I'm not sure if what we saw in Blizzard's preview is a design choice or a bug.
