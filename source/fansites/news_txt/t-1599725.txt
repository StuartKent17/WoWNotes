Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons: Dwarven Bunker / War Mill
Today we are taking a look at the Dwarven Bunker / War Mill http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/8-dwarven-bunker garrison building. The third tier of this build is unlocked by having 20 Level 100 followers http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/9129-filling-the-ranks.

This building takes up a Large plot which can also be used for the Stables http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/65-stables, Mage Tower / Spirit Lodge http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/37-mage-tower, Gnomish Gearworks / Goblin Workshop http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/162-gnomish-gearworks, or Barracks. Once upgraded to Tier 3, your garrison will have two Large plots available.

Abilities
This building is good for getting better quest rewards when leveling, gearing up followers to do raid missions, buying transmog gear, and earning one of your three bonus rolls with no effort every week. For example, this quest reward Wisdom of Dionar http://beta.wowdb.com/items/112960-wisdom-of-dionar can randomly be upgraded to Wisdom of Dionar http://beta.wowdb.com/items/112960-wisdom-of-dionar?bonusIDs=15


Level 1 - Doubles the chance for your quest rewards to get a rare or epic Bonus Upgrade, and increases the potency of the upgrade. Allows the collection of armor scraps from the orc clans of Draenor for armor transmogrification use. 
Level 2 - Opens up work orders for follower weapons and armor in exchange for garrison resources. Also, new armor transmogrification items unlock.
Level 3 - Grants 1 of your 3 seals of tempered fate http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/994-seal-of-tempered-fate raid bonus loot roll at no cost each week.



Work Orders
The Dwarven Bunker / War Mill allows you to exchange Garrison Resources http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/824-garrison-resources for follower armor/weapon upgrades and Iron Horde Scraps http://beta.wowdb.com/items/113681-iron-horde-scraps and Apexis Crystals http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/823-apexis-crystal. Currently 20 Garrison Resources is converted into roughly a few Iron Horde Scraps and a few Apexis Crystals, along with the occasional armor or weapon upgrade for your followers.

Soloing Old Content
Old Raid Solo Bugs
Tried again in this new 18927 build, still experiencing same thing. Reduced damage against bosses.
Just to confirm, this is a bug - we're working on a fix. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/342057-old-raid-solo-nerf-or-just-bugs-with-squish/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14525572649?page=1#14

Post-Squish Legacy Content
We're going through and making adjustments based on this thread, other feedback, and our own internal testing. Some of the issues were pure oversights; others reflect a loophole when it comes to self-inflicted or friendly-fire damage, for which we're working on a comprehensive fix.

I do want to clarify, however, that our changes are only intended to offset the direct effects of the "squish" and our goal has been to make sure that linearizing the item curve between item levels ~60 and 463 doesn't impact the ability to solo legacy content. That is not the same as saying that we guarantee nothing will change, period - we've made a number of adjustments to tank mitigation, healing, defensive cooldowns, and so forth. That's nothing new for an expansion, and in some cases, yes, that will make old content more challenging than it was in 5.4.8, especially for tank specs that could previously use Vengeance to great effect. But that has nothing to do with the item squish.

There is no specific intent or plan for when and whether anything becomes soloable. That's up to you.

We design the content to be appropriately difficult for the original audience at the appropriate level whether that's a few players in the outdoor world, a dungeon group with a dedicated tank and healer, a full raid group, etc.. Over time, as player power grows through access to higher levels, more powerful gear, new talents, and so forth, content that used to require a group becomes soloable, organically. Some classes tanks, those with better self-healing, those with pets will be able to do it sooner than others, but everyone will get there eventually. It might take an extra tier, or even an extra expansion, but that's just the nature of how the power curve works. And if you can't solo something but are interested in a shot at a transmog item, achievement, or rare mount, you can always bring a friend or two.

We don't nerf old content specifically to make it soloable - we occasionally make quality-of-life changes when a mechanic like Thorim's cleanup that reset the fight if the arena was unoccupied is artificially preventing players who have the raw power to solo an encounter from doing so. But we don't go back and specifically make old content numerically easier. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/337959-feedback-post-squish-legacy-content/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14277488311?page=6#119

PvP
Setting up realms that will meet in Ashran. It's like playing the dating game for WoW servers. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/512763525664497664
would love a post on how you pick and decide! Would be very fun to read and learn.
Primary goal is: both sides of Ashran feel equally full. Doesn't mean both servers need same population. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/512767412253360129

There should be rewards before 2000, especially the 2000 mark aswell to increase participation.
We have rewards for participation below 2000. Conquest gear and the Vicious mounts. They've proven very effective holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/513013767634837504
Rating inflation works fine, and I'm sure it's not changing, just rewards requirements being raised, right?
Correct holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/513025501519421440
Btw, I noticed there were 2 new PvP "illusion" enchants, primal victory + glorius tyranny, whats the difference?
Just typo fixes. Glorious Tyranny is last expac. Primal Victory is this expac. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/513033858963734528

I heard the Tarren Mill vs Southshore match has been reduced to 40 vs 40. Can you pls confirm?

Warlords of Draenor Lore
You say Thrall had "too big a presence in Cata" but you don't think that it was orc centric? It was about thrall saving us
It was about all of the mortal races and the dragonflights coming together to stop Deathwing. Thrall was one piece. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513765792132116480

Except his part in Nagrand. Liked the cutscene, but I can't agree with WHO it was. Thrall is big enough
At this point it's obvious Thrall made a mistake with Garrosh. I think his role in WoD is fair. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513768149939130368

Everything from the zones, bosses, and even the cinematics is all ORCS. You even had Thrall kill Garrosh. It was awesome cinema
That's like saying MoP was only pandaren. Overall theme? Sure. But actual content is varied: many creatures and monsters. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513787413890859009
They're a big focus. My point was mostly that previous expacs weren't "orc expansions." Even still, WoD is not only orcs. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513786955919028224

That's just a pretty simple rule. If we're the heroes, we should get the glory.
You're constantly referred to as heroes, saviors of Azeroth. Big NPCs don't diminish that - they enforce it _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513786485007716352
Granted, I think we hold back the killing blow too often. We should let players kill the bosses more. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513786684065214464
Tirion is mostly in the background, so his interference is fine. Thrall is always the center of the story.
In Cata he was probably too involved. We acknowledge that. In WoD it's a special case: poetic justice. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513787634502873089
Not to mention his obvious connection with the Frostwolf clan. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513787684511580160
Sure, it'd be weird if Thrall was uninvolved. But you can see why him saving us from Garrosh would be taken ill.
Yeah, I definitely understand the concern. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513789894544855040
Thrall really feels he came full circle with the spoiler cinematicAfter WoD it could be a good send off for him
I think it was necessary for his arc to be satisfying. Who knows what he'll do next. He does have a family. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513788593727602688
if you want people to like him again, he needs to lose badly. Superman is only interesting when vulnerable.
I don't know that Alliance players will ever really like him. As a War3 and Horde player, I always have. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513790471995674624
Thing I like about Thrall is that he's the soul of the horde. On the outside, they look like monsters. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513790602832789504
But Thrall's horde was about honor and family. They are noble ideals. Thrall + Cairne are the best. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513790847155208193
It makes him more human alltho he's an orc We shall see through the patches;D
He's sort of a bridge between humanity and orcmanity? due to his upbringing. I liked him as that role. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513792147737563136

Yeah. Thrall's a visionary. He wants to change things, not insist he's always right. Should've owned up.
Thing is, we tried to go more neutral with him as the World Shaman in Cata, and people hated him. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513792231929806848

Part of it; also that humans/orcs always pushed. See: Ashran capitols, garrisons.
In a way, Thrall's place in the current environment is as difficult for us as it is for him. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513793726356160512
This could put him in a more passive advisory role that wouldn't threaten player spotlight and it'd let him evolve as a character
I'd like to see him focus on his family and advising Vol'jin in rebuilding the Horde. But it's not my call! _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513796493640495104

You can't claim someone as being central antagonist when they appear for a second. Thrall was everywhere in Cata, Garrosh in MoP.
Antagonist is the one who creates the conflict, i.e. Deathwing and the Twilight's Hammer trying to blow up the world. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/514091452427554816

I mean, please explain why in Cata Thrall took central focus when it should have been Malfurion? You know, nature guy?
While heroes of the mortal races the players defeat most of the enemies. Everyone plays a part. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/514097163601575936
The elements are a shaman's domain. Thrall becomes the most powerful shaman on Azeroth in order to hold it together. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/514096994428547072
It just seems like a bad decision to not work in the Malfurion/Emerald Dream storyline when players have wanted it for so long.
He was in Hyjal and Molten Front, but I'd like to see him and the other night elves more often considering their power. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/514113001876492288
That's mine and some others concern. We fear good heroes Malfurion, Tyrande, Genn are being forgotten while Thrall takes stage.
I think in WoD we kept it light on big names because we want the player character as the main hero, _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/514117313751027712
Khadgar is there Tirion-esque and Thrall is there to learn about his heritage. Primarily, the players are the big guns here. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/514118130629873665

when they know he's alive. I hope we see his shadowhunters more and Rokhan
Rokhan and the shadow hunters are in the Horde garrison and serve as scouts all over Draenor. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513797727902507009

Yrel is looking very promising, indeed. Y'all should feel proud about her.
A lot of people worked very hard on Yrel. It's tough to build a brand new character in 1 expac of leveling. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/513790168252563456

Uhm.. The Garrosh intro: He was building up to be a big baddy, not 'Rushing to explore'.
Can't it be both? Ally find island, both factions send expeditions find Anduin, explore, gain land. It escalates in 5.1. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/514094702170107905
It can't really, when Garrosh made his intentions fairly clear from the start. He was looking for conquests, not adventures.
Sort of careening wildly off point here, which is that both factions drove the story to Pandaria. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/514115497642565632
They didn't though.. Anduin just *happened* to end up there.
He shipwrecked there, which is how anyone found the island, and is why Varian sent troops. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/514217526595555328

World
That reminds me--Brewfest is tomorrow. Too bad some of the cool holiday updates are just on the PTR/beta.
Things to look forward to during the entire life of the expac is what world events should be all about Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/513071081628786689
I think it's just that we had a relative drought of updates in MoP and all the datamined things are so cool!
Yea, I would love to see the world events get new toys or pets or at least something new every year if possible! #WoW
We would very much like this as well. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/513074436002443264

Will there be achievements for the rares in Pandaria similar to "A Worthy Opponent" & its meta "Glorious"? None in beta so far..
Not this round, rares serving a bit of a diff. purpose, felt like there was plenty of long-term cheevos in WoD Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/513078933525233664
I wondered since they are "leveling rares" this time out. So all rewards, etc pertinent to current rares finished in beta?
Should be, let us know if you find anything amiss! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/513079972022349824

Garrisons
Why is Gamon in the Alliance Garrison & a Dwarf in the Horde Garrison. This doesn't make sense !!. @Muffinus
The inn is a place for all weary travellers to spend the night, so long as they're nice about it. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/512770241609224192

Can followers have their rarity upgraded? I know I'd rather use Admiral Taylor rather than some schlub who is rare instead
Yes! Once they hit level 100, their XP goes towards increasing their rarity. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/513795112015757312
