We didn&apos;t particularly want a lot of these items in circulation, so that&apos;s partially intended. We really do want to keep legendary weapons legendary, and Dragonwrath ended up being more readily available than we were comfortable with.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, we should have recognized that the completion rate was faster than we wanted, and taken action, sooner. <br>

Legendary Staff - Smoldering Essence Droprate Stealth Nerf Confirmed<br>
One of the many stealth nerf deployed yesterday on live realms was a nerf of the questline to obtain Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa&apos;s Rest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71086/dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest/), but not in a good way.<br>
<br>
The droprate of Smoldering Essences required for the Heart of the Flame (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29307/heart-of-flame/) quest has been considerably lowered, you will now get about 50% less essences than before the nerf.<br>
<br>
<br>
For example, you will now get 9 or 10 essences from bosses in 25-Man Heroic mode instead of 17-19. <br>
Players in 10-Man Heroic mode will only get 3 or 4 instead of an average of 7. <br>
<br>
<br>
This change is surprising and might not be a good news for players, if Blizzard suddenly wants some parts of the game to last longer before the next patch. <br>
<br>
Just like any of yesterday&apos;s nerf to the firelands raid bosses, we don&apos;t have any comment or information from Blizzard at this point and the only comment is from a Blizzard QA poster who confirmed that this is indeed an intentional change.<br>
This was an intentional change, not a bug.</div></div>
