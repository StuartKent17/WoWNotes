Onyxia Solo Kill<br>
Yesterday (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=7985.0) we talked about a 5-man Gruul kill, today we might have something even more impressive, an Onyxia solo kill (http://warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=76343) by a Druid ! (Serennia (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Cho%27gall&amp;n=Serennia) from V A N Q U I S H (http://www.vqguild.net/) on US-Cho&apos;gall)<br>

Below is a small part of the comment posted on Warcraftmovies (http://warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=76343) : <br>
<br>
As anyone that has ever done Onyxia with a low amount of people knows, there is a bug in the encounter that existed even pre-BC that causes one of her warder patrols to aggro during the second phase if she happens to be flying over the south end of her lair at the same time that the patrol is there. To combat this bug, and to allow a guildmate to spectate, I brought in a hunter from our guild that would immediately suicide at the start and remain dead unless this bug happened to occur. In the event that the warder would aggro, I would combat rez him so that he would help kill the warder, and then immediately die again without any further assistance in the fight. Most would agree that this is still considered a solo feat despite having to do this to combat Blizzard&apos;s design flaw.<br>
<br>
If you watched Ted&apos;s solo attempt movie, he states that fire resistance gear and certain talents/strategies are required, which as you can see from this, that it is not. The only real requirement to do this is to make sure you have -5.6% crit reduction, which is around 226 resilience. This should hopefully encourage other people seeking a challenge to attempt a solo Onyxia. Ted also stated in his movie description the following:</div></div>
