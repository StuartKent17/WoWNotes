Beginning after the maintenance on Tuesday, October 9, ink traders will be converting from accepting Blackfallow Ink (http://www.wowdb.com/items/61978) to accepting Ink of Dreams (http://www.wowdb.com/items/79254) and Starlight Ink (http://www.wowdb.com/items/79255) will become available for purchase. If you&#x2019;re still holding on to your Blackfallow Ink (http://www.wowdb.com/items/61978), your time to trade it in is running short.<br>

Vengeance Hotfix<br>
A hotfix will be applied to adjust how Vengeance stacks for tanks of all classes:<br>
<br>
<br>
Vengeance should now ramp up more quickly. Avoidance will now grant Vengeance based on the average damage of the avoided NPC auto-attack, instead of just refreshing existing Vengeance. This does not apply to enemy special attacks.<br>
<br>
<br>
This will be noted in the next hotfix update, but we wanted to let you know immediately, as this change will be applied sometime today.</div></div>
