Boubouille2007-07-08, 04:39 AMBlizzard is taking down the Paid Character Transfer for a while to have all the known problems checked. Cards rejected, multiple charges, horribly long waiting time

As some of you have already noticed, the Paid Character Transfer service has been temporarily shut down so that further efforts may be made to ensure that its correct functionality is restored; our developers are currently working to repair the underlying coding issues that have contributed to the present complications for many players. While it is not known at this time when further updates shall become available, you may rest assured that we shall make you aware with all due haste at that time; for now, we are greatly appreciative of your continued patience. Thanks, folks. &#58;
