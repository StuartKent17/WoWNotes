The Major League Gaming PC Circuit, played on HP, rolls into sunny southern California November 6th-8th 2009 at the Anaheim Convention Center. Once again the very best World of Warcraft teams, hand selected by MLG, will be competing for over $15,000 cash, three HP Firebird computers and a chance to compete in the MLG WoW Championships in January. Amid much speculation and much guessing at the lineup by the community, the official lineup has now been announced by MLG. The official list is as follows:
