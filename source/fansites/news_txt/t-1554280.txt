Don't understand devs' love for players standing still. Movement is fun.
So is caring about the specialness of movement, and the gameplay value of it. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487760088795336705

What's the intent with new blood 4pc? Blood shield can't deplete, so immune to physical damage for 10sec?
Your Shield can't drop below X% of your health; ie, every hit on you, Blood Shield will at least absorb that much. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487755376087953408

SI really gone for balance? Barkskin is so weak in comparison even with a 30second cd
Barkskin is generally regarded as stronger, especially in PvP. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487748990486601729
I get killed with barkskin up almost every time I queue. And SI would help a lot more in raids since druids have no immunity
With the Barkskin glyph? It's extremely strong in PvP. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487750293740740608

Are you even considering changing the new MM mastery? .. I would like to PVP as MM .. dont ruin my spec please
I'm not sure how that ruins your spec. It's valuable for PvP, situationally and is optional anyway. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487750513484517376
stand still in PVP, hunters need to kite all the time, or else we get instat wrecked. It never goes off in PVP
You should try harder to get some stand-still time in. It is absolutely possible. You only have to stop for 3 sec. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487754545053724672
only hunter def is roar of sacri, and one talent row. That is no where near other classes. You cannot face tank melee or casters
And Deterrence, and Disengage, and the other defensive talent row, and traps... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487758624622538752

yes, thanks for reply. Speaking about heating up fade on none crit hit. The grace delay was a good fix 1/2
We feel like the grace delay worked well. It may need some slight retuning after the responsiveness fix, though. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487745674939609088

And in the category of nearly mandatory talents: Spirit Shell at Level 75. http://t.co/s5xP9BnOGs
We think that's an interesting choice because Spirit Shell is not necessarily a throughput gain, whereas the others are. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487743120231002112

MM, ele and arms masteries changed for being too similar to MS. Why not combat?
Combat's Mastery we changed to offhand dmg; has interaction with your other abilities. We decided it was different enough. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487742712121024512

Is the Echo of the Elements ui notification final? Looks like it's hard to see and not as flashy as Lava Surge & Fulmination.
No. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487686965265850369

I know it's MOLTEN earth, but sounds like it should be nature damage.
Nature is heavily overloaded, unfortunately. Rocks/Earth doing damage are typical physical, and we didn't want this to be ... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487746660965949441
...affected by armor, or weirdly bypass armor."Nature" damage is crazy. Poison, Solar, Plants, Lightning, Earth, Wind, Chi, etc. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487747190345834497

Minor Glyph to make Molten Earth for Shamans summon Pandaria Earth Spirits.
It doesn't summon anything. Heard that misconception several times now, perhaps there's a better way to word the tooltip. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487744138368929794
"incite the earth around to come to their aid" Since shamans call Elementals for aid, "incite" sounds like the earth comes alive
In a way, it does, but they're not units, they're missiles. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487745178061398016
is this the same stone missiles the ogre shamans use in frost fire ridge?
Very similar, but more polished for players. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487747563978637312

about new Ele mastery, will CL last target be the one you cast or the random one hit by the last chain?
First target. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487760587409985537

Did the cool lightning from sky visual effect got scrapped for ele shammies? ;
I reckon that that was not the last you'll see of that visual. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487781930956365824

Any chance LB for EnhShaman will be revisited? Or is hardcasting LB as melee to avoid MW overcapping part of our skillcap?
Part of your skillcap. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487845735056941056

Any chance you'll ever take WS off the GCD? Fury still feels terrible as is.
It'd feel worse with WS off the GCD. You'd have a *ton* of rotational deadtime. Would feel extremely slow. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487748011133382657

"Tanks now take 25% additional damage while engaged in PvP combat." Does this count Protection warriors in Glad stance too.
Currently, no. It's something we could do if needbe, but don't think it's needed currently. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487754848180264960

...2 RB, bloodsurge proc, and full rage, no matter what we do feels wrong. Rage capping, wasting RBs and letting enrage fall...
In that case, you should be doing WS-WS-WS-WS-WS-WS-WS-WS-BR-RB-RB-BT. No lost rage, or RBs. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487749999451582464
Did BT get a massive nerf/change in your build? You really prioritize it last? Dump to 0 rage / 0 RB before you BT...
During a CS? Absolutely. It's the lowest DPCT. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487755497089425408

does Sudden Death's Execute proc increase based on rage or will it be as if we had minimum rage?
Currently, yes. Strongly suspicious that that's too strong, though. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487756370083450880

Prot Warriors can continue to avoid/block while in Bladestorm dispite the tooltip removing that description. intended?
Yes. That wording was removed from several tooltips to make them more understandable. No functional change. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487846269574868992

Art
Will Yrel have a custom, unique model like Jaina,Vol'jin etc or will she use a heavily modified version of new Draenei female?
Yrel's model has a couple custom elements, but isn't a whole unique model like Velen or Khadgar. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/487673677400403968

Character / Items
color variation artists have made whenever you want, for a fee
I love the idea of dying armor like Diablo did. I get a little worried with user-made content, because we're internet people. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487488224647184384

PvP
so you're fixing small details to the flag points that no one looks at when you could fix mmr and stop 0 point games
The artist that made this flag post does not work on the MMR system holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/487942602415546370

Could we get any information regarding the Tournament realm when it's coming up and so on or is it top secret?
We're finalizing details to share. Sorry for the delay. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/487717957808566272

Does the damage against Tanks stack higher if they are carrying a flag In a Normal or Rated BG?.
The damage debuff for flag carrying remains the same so they'll stack holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/487775294510481409

Garrisons
Do Garrisons have specific music? Would be awesome; for example variation of vanilla Orgrimmar music.
They have their own music, but you can get a boom box that lets you change the music Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/488014619647418368
