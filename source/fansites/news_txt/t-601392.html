(Will try to change the list during the week too, the current version is way too hard to read)<br>
<br>
I know you love them, here is another addon highlight. Today I&apos;ll talk about skinner, which is the mod I used on this screenshot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/june/newhonor_plate.jpg) for example. <br>
Basically, skinner changes the layout of all your windows, character frame, inventory, etc, to something ... different (and in my opinion, better). <br>
<br>
Clicking the picture will redirect you to wowace.com download page, just browse through the list. But to be honest you should use WowAceUpdater (http://www.wowace.com/wiki/WinAceUpdater), if you never used it before it&apos;s gonna change your life. <br>

Won&apos;t post too many important things today, there is a lot of work going on the site and I&apos;ll probably be able to release a few things soon, tonight or tomorrow if there isn&apos;t too much slacking. <br>
<br>
Don&apos;t worry, I know that a lot of things are lacking updates, and it will be fixed very soon. ^^</div></div>
