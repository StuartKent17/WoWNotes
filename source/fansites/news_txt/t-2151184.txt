Upcoming Class Tuning Hotfixes
Hey all. As with each major patch that significantly changes class spells and abilities, we review tuning based on live data once it’s live, to look for any tuning issues that may have arisen. Based on that, we’re planning to make the following changes during the next weekly restarts in each region. We’ll continue to pay close attention to each spec’s performance as players progress through the Nighthold, and are ready to make further adjustments as necessary.

Arena Rewards
Just a quick update, we're still reviewing the accuracy of the data, but barring any unforeseen problems, we hope to re-distribute rewards at some point next week. Blue Tracker [/b] ] Official Forums 

Legendary Item Sources
Just to confirm, this is intended and not a bug. Blingtron 6000's gift packages do have a chance of containing a legendary. He's a nice guy like that! well, sometimes, at least.

Does fishing? it's quite a popular post on reddit, seems the SS is fake, but can you confirm?
Can confirm that we believe the screenshot is indeed fake. After checking, there aren't any fishing pools that award Legendaries so if this player truly did get a Legendary, it's a bug. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Blood Plague V2
Sorry for the trouble caused by this. Antibiotics have been deployed and it seems to have sorted everything out. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Tooltips
you guys can't just send out a small tool tip patch to fix it? Seems simple enough.
We have that capability, but the effort required mostly in terms of translation makes it not worth it in most cases. Celestalon 
The process of translating the English text into 13? other languages still has very high overhead. Celestalon 
Translation is something that's most efficiently done in bulk patches, not one-off little translations hotfixes. Celestalon
