Raid Finder Highmaul - Arcane Sanctum Bosses Missing Loot<br>
We wanted to let you know that we are aware of reports that neither Tectus nor Ko&apos;ragh are dropping loot in the second wing of Highmaul. We are currently looking into those reports and hope to have the issue resolved as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re monitoring the situation and will provide details as they become available. <br>
<br>
Update<br>
It looks like we were able to implement a resolution for the issue that should allow any new instances of the raid to function correctly. Going forward bosses will drop loot normally.<br>
<br>
We are looking into possible resolutions for those impacted by the issue prior to the fix and will provide an update as soon as we know more. <br>
<br>
Update 2 12/17 6:30 pm<br>
We had hoped that we would be able to implement a resolution to those impacted by the earlier boss loot issue so that additional contact would not be necessary but unfortunately it seems that will not be possible.<br>
<br>
If you killed the first and/or third boss in the Arcane Sanctum (2nd Wing of Highmaul) this morning and did not receive any loot, neither gold nor items, please submit a ticket though our Support Site (https://battle.net/support/en/help/) and our In-Game Support staff will work to address the issue.<br>
<br>
Thank you all for your patience.<br>
<br>

Developer Commentary: We&#x2019;re aware of excessive queue times for Heroic Dungeons.
