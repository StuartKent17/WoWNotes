Smoothest Launch Ever!<br>
Shout out to our amazing server engineers (https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/770533667131133952) and the other folks who have helped make this launch a success! A lot of them worked tirelessly through long and stressful nights to make sure this went smooth. They typically live in the background of our day-to-day activities here, but I&apos;ve never seen such an awesome launch since I started playing WoW, so the praise is deserved!<br>
<br>
Another shout out to all the testers who have tirelessly supplied their feedback and notes on bugs, issues, and crashes over the course of Alpha and Beta - you guys helped create this experience as well, and we couldn&apos;t have done it without you.<br>
<br>
Blizzard has amazing teams, and it&apos;s been awesome seeing us all come together to pull this off. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/756707-smoothest-launch-ever/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20748896027?page=1#8))<br>

Cenarion Circle Reputation and Artifact Quests<br>
I can&apos;t do the Druid artifact quests because I&apos;m hostile with the Cenarion Circle. Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem won&apos;t speak to me. Can you guys turn him into a neutral faction NPC please? I know this is karma for the hours spent murdering Moonglade Guards but this is literally barring me entry from WoW Legion. I&apos;m pretty sad right now. <br>
This issue has been hotfixed. <br>
<br>
Cenarion Circle has decided to make peace with everyone. <br>
<br>
You should now all be able to get the quest.<br>
<br>
If you find any remaining issues related to this issue please let us know.<br>
<br>

Amazon Collector&apos;s Edition Delay<br>
Just got word from Amazon (today, release day, on the day I was supposed to take delivery) that my Collector&apos;s Edition will not arrive until sometime between the end of September and the end of October.<br>
We have been investigating this and learned that there was a shipping issue which impacted some players who pre-ordered their CE from select retailers. We&#x2019;re currently working with these retailers to address this issue and make sure these players get their copy of the CE as quickly as possible. We hope that this will be resolved shortly for you and any others affected.
