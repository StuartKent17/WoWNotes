Blue Tweets<br>
Classes<br>
So you seem really set on balancing tank damage but ignore the huge healing output differences in 25m heroic content.<br>
Source? Meters are a terrible way to assess healer potency. They work reasonably well for assessing tank DPS. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/386142166596087809))<br>
<br>
k what&apos;s with the warlock hate after patch release? nerfing 1 class to keep others in check is lame. buff mage huntard instead<br>
We&apos;d have to buff a lot of classes and then likely buff the encounters as well to compensate for all the higher damage. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385583221586419712))<br>
<br>
There&apos;s so much focus on getting singletarget dps within 1%, but AoE/cleave feels like there are 50% differences..<br>
I don&apos;t think ST at 1% differences and AE at 50% differences are true and they&apos;re certainly not goals. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385496001605165058))<br>
Keep in mind AE varies enormously depending upon duration, number of targets and proximity of targets. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385496147877318656))<br>
ST is more a function of ramp up time and duration (whether sustained or burst matters more on that fight). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385496215434952704))<br>
<br>
Hundreds of constant minor tweaks erode class diversity. Ppl would complain less frequently if you changed less.<br>
Do you think that&apos;s true or do you think they would just feel ignored since long-standing problems would go untreated? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385141294852354048))<br>
<br>
I would like to see healing go back to making smart choices and acting upon them. I don&apos;t want the game to heal for me.<br>
We agree in general, but how do you solve something like e.g. Atonement or Binding Heal glyph? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384846145597366272))<br>
By making them poor. Any spell for which the game chooses the targets for you should lose to smart player decisions<br>
Yeah, we think that is a good direction. We&apos;d just need to make sure each healer had a &quot;dumb (but smart!)&quot; alternative. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384852261165219840))<br>
I&apos;m not sure casting PW:S on the whole raid or spamming Holy Light/Rejuv were &quot;smart player decisions&quot;.<br>
It&apos;s hard to imagine AE heals that aren&apos;t smart heals unless they are like HRain (area based) or PoH (goofy party based). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385140020727652352))<br>
<br>
&quot;...why play a non dot?&quot; why make a dot spec if multidotting is always going to hold back it&apos;s single target dmg?<br>
Class diversity? Why make a non dot spec if your ST damage is always going to hold back your AE? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385135323262361601))<br>
At least players no longer say &quot;I don&apos;t care about AE because that&apos;s just for trash.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385135402505359360))<br>
<br>
If a tooltip is starting to get complex, I think it means that ability has too many jobs to do &amp; needs rethinking.<br>
We agree. That is just one of the risk of having too many spells of the design &quot;X replaces Y but with Z extra effect.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384851844700188672))<br>
<br>
sorry meant that most players just want to feel their dps is competitive but not the hardcore min/max definition<br>
I used to think that, but I think today a lot of players look at highest possible DPS even though it barely affects them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384850764130045952))<br>
(And when I say &quot;a lot&quot; it still probably isn&apos;t that many total, but more than it used to be.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384850844266401792))<br>
<br>
The overall problem is you&apos;re not even trying to achieve class balance. When you do, then we can have a meaningful discussion.<br>
We aren&apos;t trying to have all classes tie in all situations, no. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384840135486865409))<br>

BrM nerf = fine, the way you doing it = terrible. You are nerfing our already &quot;bad&quot; 2p as well. Any compensation to our 2p?<br>
The alternative is to nerf monks and then buff WW damage, but that carries a lot more bug risk. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385496416753184768))<br>
I think it&apos;s hard to justify Brewmaster damage being so much higher than other tanks though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385496504191811584))<br>
<br>
exactly what aspect of revival prior to the 30% nerf broke the game?<br>
The cast time. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384849085154336768))<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#U))<br>
What happened to &quot;take dmg done into calculation for healer balance&quot;? And agree about all smartheals, they need to be limited.<br>
Do you meant Atonement damage done? It&apos;s really fine and Atonement healing is fine too. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385140187983925248))<br>
The deal IMO is that Disc can shift so effortlessly into that role whenever you don&apos;t need a lot of healing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385140294850576384))<br>

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warlock) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#k))<br>
- In all fairness and honesty, PvE Warlocks probably wouldn&apos;t be hurt too terribly with another nerf or two. - A PvE Warlock<br>
We worry the Affliction nerf isn&apos;t large enough, but we&apos;ll see how it goes. We try and err on the side of not over-nerfing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385583423546351616))<br>
<br>
So are you gonna talk about the agony 15% stealth nerf? or is that going to be what must not be named?<br>
It&apos;s not intended as a stealth nerf. The hotfix notes just haven&apos;t caught up yet. Affliction DPS was still too high. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385495809401180160))<br>
Call it w.e you want. In most players eyes, it&apos;s a blatant nerf. Did you honestly think players wouldn&apos;t notice?<br>
If they didn&apos;t, they would when the hotfix notes went out for the day. Stealth nerfs serve no purpose; players will figure it out. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385580921102954496))<br>
<br>
yet that becomes a basis for damage too high, I think youre over nerfing here.<br>
What current fight would you consider warlocks to be weak on? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385582857483063297))<br>

So warriors socket straight crit as arms or fury, yet you took away their static crit buff...why?<br>
The intent of group buffs is that individuals can make the group stronger, not that individuals can be very self sufficient. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/386138542243446784))<br>
<br>
What about rage from damage taken? what was the reasoning for removing that?<br>
For tanks, it made offtanking rough. For PvP, it made not getting attacked rough. For PvE DPS it meant standing in fires. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385136625652490240))<br>
We tried to capture some of the feel with Berserker Stance, which isn&apos;t quite there yet, but is pretty close. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385136712365522944))<br>

Professions<br>
Do you &#x2014;master of all UIs&#x2014; think that the profession panel could display the breakdown of ingredients? #craftingnoodlecarts<br>
Could the profession UI suck less? Absolutely. What do you mean by breakdown specifically? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384846605209178112))<br>
<br>
Wondered if you&apos;ve ever considered account-wide professions? With alts so prevalent is the 2 per char limit still useful?<br>
Would love to see more discussion on this topic from players. Alts are cool, but alts just to get around the prof limit bug me. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384839308781170688))<br>

One of this week&apos;s Blue Tweets talked about (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384839308781170688) creating alts just to have access to more professions. Have you created alts that are mostly just to have access to more professions?<br>
