WoWSocial Addon China Only
A nice new Group Finder feature is coming in Warlords of Draenor, but NetEase has come up with a solution for Chinese players to use today. Players in China are currently testing an addon that allows for group chats, creating groups, and scheduled events with cross realm players. 

Unfortunately the addon won't work on US/EU servers in its current state, as it relies on passing messages between servers via officially run characters that serve as message passing proxies. 

You can see the translated FAQ and translated screenshots below, but keep in mind that things can be lost in translation. Thanks to ngacnlcq for the translation!

If you accept the application, tick it, or you can cross it if you refuse. You can also right click the group you created in "My Group" to "View Profile" to view the application.


Blue Posts
Warlords of Draenor Professions
We're actually hoping to do a bunch of work with crafting in Warlords. Nothing I can share any concrete details on yet, but we're talking about it a lot. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Raid Finder and Group Browser
So my question becomes are they seriously doing away with the current LFD/LFR system that is in place for WoD, or am I totally misunderstanding this. 
We're not getting rid of LFR or LFD. We're just creating an easier way for players who want to do content without random matchmaking to find other players. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Indirect Flight Paths
Ok Blizzard. Please create direct flight paths. Seriously stop wasting our time with connecting flights and slow flight path speeds. This isn't real life, you aren't losing money every time a flight path takes off half empty... PLEASE PLEASE just make direct flights and speed this [fluffy bunny] up. Your just wasting our time on these 5 min flights. That is why people stop playing, poor customer design and input.
We've said it in the past, but I'll repeat it here. If there are bad flight paths that just don't make sense, let us know. We can always take a look at them. We also plan to make sure the flight paths and transportation in Warlords of Draenor is as convenient as possible as well. We don't plan to remove the feeling of traveling feeling like traveling still though. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 


Ghostcrawler's Tweets
Today was Ghostcrawler's last day at Blizzard, but he can still be found on Twitter at OccupyGStreet 
Ghostcrawler's Departure
I'm not surprised the internet doesn't actually understand what my job was. I am surprised it is so certain in its bad assumptions. Source 
To be fair you've not done a whole lot to help dispell the myths.
Really? I am always careful to say "we" when describing a new feature or game change that the design team is going to make. Source 
We've always assumed it was the royal "we" 
Lol. No wonder MMOC posters think I'm arrogant. Source 

HOnestly, I think the number of people happy he left are greatly exaggerated. Most people think it's a sore loss.
I think that is true as well. In my experience the folks who feel they aren't being heard feel the need to yell louder. Source 
Doubt most players know who GC is and most do not know he is now gone. Not ment as disrespect btw.
None taken, and I agree completely. Most players have no idea who I am, and many that do have no idea what I do. Just read MMOC. Source 

To be clear. I've always said Chilton should be the focus of more peoples praise and ire than he's been.
It is telling that the folks who communicate less are also less controversial. Don't reinforce that, internet! Source 

I like this analogy. You acted as a lightning rod/tank as a direct public voice. I hope someone takes this up.
I remember before I worked here the frustration of not understanding why design decisions were made. It was my goal to fix that. Source 
I knew a consequence of that would be some players not agreeing with the design, but figured that was better than not knowing. Source 

Obviously I didn't do it all alone. It took a large team to handle all the systems work. I just cleared roadblocks for them. Source 
Systems design = classes, items, professions, PvP, encounters, UI, combat & major features. I spent most of my time on features Source 

I figure that any kind of 'lead' is akin to 'coach' or Scrum master supporting the team and freeing them up to do their jobs?
Exactly. I try to remove impediments that keep my team from being able to of their job. Source 

How much power does a Lead system designer have? example: guy 1 in ur team comes with an idea, can u then just turn it down?
That's not a great way to foster good morale. Typically you should give them pros and cons of their idea and see what they think. Source 
Our feedback and playtesting processes are usually good enough to catch bad ideas before they go live. Source 

will you keep the twitter account, or will it be deleted?
It's my personal account so I imagine I will keep it. I might change the name. We'll see. I certainly won't use it to discuss WoW. Source 

Are you going to become a backseat driver, er, designer for wow then? Calling and telling them they're all wrong?
I'll be ranting on the forums with all you guys. Source 

Well ghost crawler if you are leaving I hope you have had a great time working blizzard
I did. Blizzard is very much like a family. I made many friends that I will have for life. Source 

If you're rly leaving...can I have your gold? Srsly though, thank you for years of hard work helping make WoW a great game.
You wouldn't want my gold. Like all of you, we have to earn everything we get in game. Source 

If you were playing a horde character, what race would you prefer?
I'm partial to the older-looking orcs for melee or female trolls for casters. Female undead tanks are cool too. Source 

The real question is what race/gender?
Human female. I'm not judging, but I personally have trouble looking at a dude's butt for so long. Source 

are you healing hc raids without addons ? I can't live without mouseover macros for all heal spells at the very least
I try to heal without addons to get the experience and figure out what changes we need, but I certainly recognize their value. Source 
Now that you're no longer a dev, do you think you'll be more likely to use addons?
Probably. Source 

BC class design was a ways off. I hated not being able to tank raids with my Pally which was supposed to be a tank too
I played a Prot warrior at the time, and my guild only ran Heroic Shattered Halls with a pally tank and 3 mages. Not fun. Source 

shattered halls wasnt that big of a problem. The big problems with cc started in magisters terrace.
I could tank MT fine, but by then we likely outgeared it. SH was an issue because we didn't have epics yet. Source 

Just resubbed after 2 years because Warlords got me so excited, sad to hear you're leaving, best of luck to you
I'm pretty excited about Warlords. I have high hopes. Source 

the real question is are you still gonna play? And what are you gonna insta level to 90?
Yes, and I am thinking of leveling the Prot warrior who tanked vanilla or the hunter that was my first character. Source 

what will you miss the most?
The meetings where I was just sure there was no good solution, and somehow we come out of it with a great idea. Source 

: What was your proudest moment at Blizz?
Seeing a designer I really respect get a promotion. Source 
I'm not sure there is design related moment. The experience tends to be more humbling than prideful. Source 

so was "you can't have both good gameplay and good story" blizzard's company line or your own opinion?
I don't think I ever said that. I said "Gameplay first," which is a Blizzard corporate value. Source 
Other studios value story first, or world first or social first. Source 

Some advice: [My pet issue] is why there were sub losses is one of the weaker arguments players use. Players don't have that data Source 
i've canceled my sub and the data you ask the person to provide is very VAGUE. too vague for ur supposed data
But what if we looked at player history before they quit? What if we could that tell they used to PvP then stopped and when? Source 
Granted correlation is not causation, but with large enough data sets, you can still detect trends and form hypotheses. Source 

in your time at blizz what was your biggest idea/feature that never happened?
I think it will still happen, so I can't talk about it. Source 

Any chance you can talk more about the "big unannounced feature" now? 
No, because I still want them to do it! Source 
but you can talk about titan project?
I guess they can't strictly fire me, but it would be in extremely poor taste. Source 
so other question are you was on the team of this game developing?
I was only ever on WoW at Blizzard. I made very small contributions to other games when I could. Source 

One of my favorite aspects of your job, was the writing of those tips at the bottom of loading screens. True story.
I admit to writing the Alleria and Turalyon one. Source 

Wait. Was Transmog you? Do I have to find you and hug you now?
Everything we do is a group effort, but transmog was something on which I worked a lot. Source 
I had that feeling for some reason, which is why I think we won't get a Transmog Storage revamp now that you're leaving 
Nah, there is a ton of support for it on the team, which is usually what counts. Source 

Was it you who was responsible for the LFD? Even though it had its negatives, I found it to be one of the best additions!
Many of us worked on LFD. I remember the development fondly though because I worked really closely with on it. Source 

Is there any idea you regret you supported to get implemented into the game?
I wish we had done flex before Raid Finder. Flex still feels like raiding. Source 
was flex on thw radar when developing lfr?
We've thought about it for years. Balance was always the sticking point, which we finally solved by excluding the hardest level. Source 

so how much of the ToC patch in wrath was your idea?
IDK. None of it? The raid was an attempt to see if good bosses could carry lack of new art. I feel like that was answered. Source 
Heh it was Daelo's first raid after he took over from Tigole right? He needs to come back to WoW already also !Tigole
Your time frame isn't quite right. Daelo was the lead encounter designer for years and still contributes to WoW. Source 

How long have you been playing WoW? And do you have any rare mounts or mini-pets that you're particularly proud of obtaining?
I started playing in the Mauradon patch. I'm not much of a collector but there are a few rare drakes that I ride. Source 

I think he is going to design EverquestNext? Seems like the only big game in development thats worth leaving blizz.
Not sure I'd want to work on an MMO again. Anything would feel anticlimactic after WoW. Source 

Game designers must adopt the values of their studio to some extent. Somewhere else I would design differently. Source 
will we see you in the game designer position again?
Yes, but my impression is less in the trenches work and more guidance. We shall see. Source 

Will you still attend Blizzcon?
Probably as a guest, if I didn't feel it would detract from the actual developers. Source 

u can finally stop pretend everything is wonderful and perfect now! Gratz, Blizz can finally get someone serious
I think you will find WoW design philosophy comes from the team and not any one individual. Don't expect many changes. Source 
I'm just waiting for the rage posts, "this happened because ghostcrawler left!"
Those tweets will come from me though, perhaps lessening the effect. Source 

with you being gone from the dev team, what kind of changes do you see might happen in wow down the road.
Nothing drastic. Radical change probably isn't a good strategy for a 9-year-old game. Source 

Is someone going to get a post of Lead System Desinger?
Not for me to say, but I suspect they will structure things a little differently for the time being. Source 

I wouldn't want to take credit for MoP if I was you either, it's far from a masterpiece.
We're pretty happy with it. Still the fact remains that our game development isn't like a kitchen with some all powerful head chef. Source 

How important do you thing esports will be for a game to maintain longevity in the future? esp they get more visibility
Depends on the game. Minecraft had no real esport. Source 
Minecraft didn't have much of a game to be frank. Still esports and the tight balance needed hurt variety in WoW.
Not sure it was esport per say. Arena was easier to balance when we only cared about RMP. That didn't sit well with everyone else. Source 

Try to stay involved with the game community in your new job. I know it sucks a ton of time from design but it is appreciated.
I love interacting with the community. I wouldn't want to give that up. Source 

Do you feel that with your comunication, you kinda spoiled the gaming comunity and set the bar too high for other companies?
I don't know how much of that is on me, but if it encourages more dev communication with players, then it's well worth it. Source 

Do you think your Twitter "experiment" was a success? I think so! Thank you for taking your time to talk and hear to us.
I think so overall. It has let me communicate with a lot more players in more regions than forum posts did. Source 
It forces players and developers! to be concise in discussions and nobody has the expectation of long diatribes. Source 
On the con side, I lose the ability to add caveats like "the system isn't perfect" or "I see where you're coming from." Source 
And I think that leads to our answers sounding curt or trite or more certain than we ever really are. Source 

I hope you saved that tag for someone or to retire it! Would suck to see someone take it and say stupid internet things.
Blizzard has the account name, and it will indeed be retired... at least until the inevitable reboot. Source 


Just Another Summer Night
