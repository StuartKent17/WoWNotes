2.3.2 Patch information<br>
Just a few words to let you know that the 2.3.2 Information Compilation (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=2506.0) has been updated, patch mirrors are now fairly recents and the item changes I posted a week ago have been added as well. <br>
<br>
As a reminder, this patch won&apos;t go live until 2008 because of the christmas holidays. (We&apos;re not getting any server maintenance this week and the week after anyway)<br>
<br>
<br>
2.4 and Sunwell information Q&amp;A<br>
Acaciaizm.com (http://acaciaizm.com/?p=313) has been updated about the 2.4 preview (see this news) with a few questions (and answers) from various sources, including this site. (Yay !)<br>
<br>
Here is a short summary :<br>
There wasn&apos;t anything said about the &quot;Legendary Hunter Bow&quot;. <br>
No talks about new Badges/Honor/Reputation rewards either, except the new Shattered Sun Offensive faction.<br>
Sets aren&apos;t class specifics, but will be tuned to fit specific needs for classes (including a Warrior and a Holy paladin tuned set).<br>
The Daily Quest cap is raised to 25 because Blizzard doesn&apos;t really want to limit them anymore and understand that people like to grind money by running daily quests instead of bashing monsters. (Also, keep in mind that the patch will introduce tons of new daily quests to help building/claiming the town in Sunwell)<br>
The design of Magister&apos;s Terrace (5-man) is based on Silvermoon City, it will also features the Blood Elve Observatory. <br>
The Sunwell Plateau (5-man) will be a multiple-buildings instance powered by captured Naarus. The last room will contain the Sunwell. <br>
Kael&apos;thas is being reused in the 5-man instance, but might be available only in heroic mode.<br>
Devs want to let more players experience the lore and get the chance to meet characters such as Kael&apos;thas. <br>
Heroic instances requirements (Revered to Honored) have been changed to let new players and alts experience enter them without having to farm normal instances. <br>
