Titanforge Rate for Weekly Cache Increased
People are getting far more titanforges from their weekly chest than before my alts got 945s, 950s from their '935' cache. 
This is an intended change to the Weekly Cache, and not a bug. Wishing you all luck with your loots!

Broken Shore Scenario Before Argus
Seems this is actually a bit more complicated than I/we thought - it is intended that alt characters can skip the Broken Shore scenario, as long as another character on your account has completed it. 

So... what people may be seeing in regards to having to complete the scenario likely means they haven't completed it on at least one character. To make sure this activates for your alts, you will need to have logged into your main character, or one that has complete the Broken Shore scenario, after the launch of 7.3. 

Once you've logged in with a character who has completed the scenario, you will be able to speak with Khadgar at Krasus' Landing and accept the "Assault on the Broken Shore" quest. 

Khadgar should have an option to skip the scenario when you next speak with him, then you will need to turn in the quest and finally return to Dalaran via Hearthstone or otherwise to receive your Argus introduction quest.

It's technically locked behind Broken Shore, but is able to be skipped on every character after the first. A bit of a communication issue this morning, but from my current understanding this is the intended functionality.

Khadgar at Krasus' Landing in Dalaran should offer you a quest for the Broken Shore when you hit 110, if you didn't receive it automatically. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
