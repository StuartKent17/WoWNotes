We&#x2019;re working on a couple of PvP hotfixes that will go live with weekly scheduled maintenance in each region (starting tomorrow on all American realms).<br>
<br>
Player versus Player<br>
<br>
Resolved an issue that prevented the intended 50% reduction to Azerite Traits in PvP from being applied to Traits found on Engineering helms.<br>
The effectiveness of Ward of Envelopment (https://www.wowdb.com/items/165569-ward-of-envelopment), Mirror of Entwined Fate (https://www.wowdb.com/items/165578-mirror-of-entwined-fate), and Void Stone (https://www.wowdb.com/items/167865-void-stone) in PvP has been reduced by 50% for player characters who are not in a healing specialization.<br>
The effectiveness of Diamond-Laced Refracting Prism (https://www.wowdb.com/items/165573-diamond-laced-refracting-prism) in PvP has been reduced by 50% for player characters who are not in a tank specialization.<br>

PTR Bug Report Update<br>
We&#x2019;ve got an update incoming to the In-Game Bug Reporter for our Public Test Realm (PTR). We&#x2019;re excited about this, because it should make it even easier for testers to get the right information to us as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
Starting with the Rise of Azshara PTR, you&#x2019;ll see a new context-sensitive hotkey for submitting bug reports. When you mouse over any Creature, NPC, Item, Achievement, or Spell in the game, there&#x2019;s now some blue text at the bottom of the tooltip that reads &#x201C;Press F6 to submit a bug for this Item&#x201D;.<br>
<br>

<br>
Simply hit that hotkey while mousing over the item or creature or spell you&#x2019;d like to report, and you&#x2019;ll see a text box pop up with the model of the creature or icon corresponding to the relevant spell or item. From there just type a short description of the misbehavior you observed, and your bug report will be sent to our Quality Assurance team for review.<br>

<br>
The default hotkey for bug reporting is F6, but this can be re-bound to any other key by pressing escape to bring up the game menu, and then selecting Key Bindings. Find the PTR sub-section of the Key Bindings menu and set the hotkey for the Tooltip Bug Hotkey to any key you like.<br>

<br>
Thanks to all testers who&#x2019;ve used the In-Game Bug Reporter in previous PTRs. With your help, we&#x2019;ve been able to review tens of thousands of bug reports. With these upcoming improvements to the system, we hope to be able to process and review even more issues that you send our way.<br>
We&#x2019;ll see you in the PTR.<br>
<br>
<br>
How do you report something that the game doesn&#x2019;t recognize as an object? Like misplaced textures or missing objects.<br>
There will still be an on-screen bug button that you can use to submit anything you&#x2019;d like to, from any disposition.<br>

Water Strider Discussion<br>
A small clarification to our plans with Mount Equipment&#x2013;<br>
Hitting level 100 on one character will unlock this system. Once unlocked, the system will be available to all characters, and the equipment pieces themselves will require level 20. If your goal is to have waterwalking while leveling, you can just enable the waterwalking Mount Equipment (there will be one available via Anglers reputation that will be bind-on-account), and it&#x2019;ll work exactly as before, with the benefit of making all of that character&#x2019;s mounts walk on water. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105253-water-strider-discussion/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/148759/170))<br>
<br>
Yeah, but now you&#x2019;d have the ability to use a mount, besides the Water Strider.<br>
I dunno about you, but being stuck using only one mount forever sounds absolutely boring as hell<br>
That&#x2019;s one of the goals here. There are a lot of mounts out there and it&#x2019;s strange to have a &#x201C;wrong choice&#x201D; when out running around. You&#x2019;ll easily be able to keep the ability just as you have it now but there will be other options that you (the player) can make if you prefer something else. How you about the world, where you often go, and how fast you like to escape from things could all contribute to what works best for your playstyle.<br>
<br>
There are a few extra notes so like Death Knights can do waterwalking via Path of Frost (and Shaman with Water Walking). That should help empower these classes a bit and help make them feel a bit more unique.<br>
<br>
I&#x2019;m not sure what the price of the waterwalking shoes will be offhand, but it should be pretty affordable on the Anglers vendor. We&#x2019;ll have the PTR up soon&#x2122; and look forward to hearing your feedback on that.

<br>
Would it be possible to have the water strider be like the sky golem. It can have innate water walking but is not effected by mount equipment?<br>
I will check but my personal opinion from my play experience is that the water strider ability is just much stronger than the sky golem herbing. We nerfed the water strider once and if we leave it with the ability there then it&#x2019;s more in the line of getting everything and less of making a choice for what you want. We want there to be a choice based on your play and interests. If herbing on the run provides too strong of a benefit then there might need to be changes there but currently I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s the case.

<br>
Brave soul. I commend you for stepping into this thread on the Monday evening preceding the drop of 8.2 on the PTR. However, this price you speak of not knowing offhand is what will be a determining factor in many players decisions. Personally, I&#x2019;ve stuck by/accepted/dealt with the changes made over the years to keep the gameplay from just becoming a static habit. But having spent my money and time acquiring the rep required to gain the reward, only to have it removed and then require it to be re-purchased&#x2026;no. That&#x2019;s the line. I&#x2019;m sorry to sound like I&#x2019;m giving an ultimatum because it&#x2019;s not. It&#x2019;s a decision made based on honor, or the lack thereof.<br>
<br>
EDIT - and to be perfectly fair, yes, I agree and have so for many years that Blizzard has the right to change content at their discretion at any time. But this is one of those times I won&#x2019;t be agreeing with it.<br>
Just something I&#x2019;d like to get your perspective on, if the character who earned the Anglers reputation along with the mount gets the water walking item for free, what would a fair price be for the alts to get it? If that character who earned the reputation and mount has the option to water walk (but might choose something else), do you feel that alts should have every single thing that the other characters have?<br>
<br>
Also, just out of curiosity, how often would you estimate that you have you used the water strider mount in the 6+ years it&#x2019;s been available?<br>
Thanks folks for chatting! (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105253-water-strider-discussion/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/148759/1664))<br>
