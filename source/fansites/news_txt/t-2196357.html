Artifact Challenge Difficulty<br>
I get that these appearances are the new hotness and everyone is after them, which causes frustration. However, it&apos;s worth noting that the solo challenges to unlock the new appearances are intended to be just that; a challenge. We don&apos;t expect the majority of players to obtain them within the first cycle of the Mage Tower being constructed.<br>
<br>
Our aim for these challenges is for them to be comparable to that of the green fire questline for Warlocks in Mists of Pandaria. In that case, only a few Warlocks were able to defeat Kanrethad immediately, but more and more were able to overcome the challenge as the expansion progressed.<br>
<br>
As we progress through the course of Legion, your character will become stronger (through Artifact progression, gear upgrades, etc), which will naturally ease the difficulty of these challenges. Likewise, as more and more players complete these challenges, more community generated content will appear giving advice for those who are struggling.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, each artifact appearance has a different source. Some reflect dedication to a particularly gameplay style, such as raiding or PvP, others for reaching milestones like completing the 7.0 Order Hall line. In the case of these challenge appearances, they are meant to show that you&apos;ve truly mastered the nuances of your spec.<br>

Broken Shore Building Uptime<br>
We will be monitoring region-wide contributions to all buildings pretty closely. If, down the line, we need to turn some knobs on our end it&apos;s something we should be able to do. Again, the topic is on our mind and we&apos;re watching to see how things play out.<br>
<br>
It&apos;s also worthwhile to note that &quot;casual&quot; players are the majority, so I don&apos;t foresee a world in the near future where the builds don&apos;t get completed at a decent pace.

Brewmasters in 7.2.5<br>
Alright, second round is on me as well, Brewmasters. Now that the weekend is over, we&apos;ve had a chance to discuss all the great feedback you all have provided so far. Here&apos;s what we&apos;re thinking:<br>
<br>
(Note that the below changes likely won&apos;t make it into the first PTR build.)<br>
<br>
Stagger Cap<br>
As I said, the goal of this was cheese-prevention, not intended to impact normal gameplay. A Stagger cap of 100%*HP has a lot of value to us due to it functioning intuitively within the UI. We had hoped that the amount we need to buff HP/Armor would be reasonable in order to make that work, but looking at the numbers and your feedback, we don&apos;t think there&apos;s enough room there. Therefore, we&apos;re now leaning toward a 200%*HP cap, and that just won&apos;t be visible in the UI (but then, neither is the cap of Guardian Spirit and the like).<br>
<br>
Active Mitigation Duration Cap<br>
There has been a ton of useful feedback about this topic. Being able to carry over a ton of banked Active Mitigation (and Ironskin Brew absolutely is AM in context) from tank swaps and low damage phases is extremely powerful, and contributes to imbalance between tanks. But we&apos;re also sympathetic to how it adds an additional complication that you need to keep in your mental space. We think that just loosening the restriction up a bit so that the window you can safely press Ironskin Brew in is much wider will satisfy that, so we&apos;re going to try a cap of 3x Duration instead of 2x. And to clarify, calling this &quot;base duration&quot; was inaccurate; I meant the duration of a single cast of Ironskin Brew, including traits (so 3x Duration would be 24sec with 4/4 of that trait).<br>
<br>
Magic DR<br>
We&apos;ve talked about having armor and potentially HP as tuning knobs to use. We also have the % of Stagger that applies to Magic to use. All of the changes we&apos;re discussing in this thread are for mechanical and playstyle reasons, and then tuning is a separate (but big and important) issue. Just to set expectations, Brewmasters with Mystic Vitality are currently seen as extremely strong against Magic damage, sometimes overpowered. Guardian Druids are also overpowered against Magic damage, and that will be adjusted as well.<br>
<br>
Thanks, and keep the feedback coming!<br>
<br>
Another point of feedback is that Brew charges feel totally wasted when not tanking (or in a low damage phase), whereas on other tanks they can at least get some offensive value out of them.<br>
<br>
This is rather experimental, but we&apos;re going to try adding an additional effect to Purifying Brew: &quot;Also increases the damage of your next Breath of Fire by 50%.&quot; (tuning not final of course).<br>
<br>
And FYI, it looks like we are going to be able to fit these latest changes (this one included) into the first PTR build. <br>
<br>
A smarter approach to the cheesing problem, is a &apos;stagger-per-strike&apos; limit.<br>
A per-hit Stagger limit is not a possible option, since the damage in question is not guaranteed to be a single hit. Ex: Something like Spellblade&apos;s Annihilation, or a pack of many adds.<br>
<br>
To be honest all of this &quot;cheesing and brewmaster&quot; thing sounds either like you&apos;re totally not aware of the fact that a lot of tank classes are able to cheese different mechanics or just like a bad excuse to make some changes to BRM for no reason.<br>
We are absolutely aware that similar mechanics can be cheesed by other classes. It&apos;s a matter of how trivial it is to do, how frequently they can do it, how much external assistance they need, etc. A Paladin being able to Divine Shield through 1 Fel Scythe every 5min is acceptable. A Brewmaster being able to just 2-3x Purify every one of them is not. Guardians are also quite high on ability to do that, which will also be adjusted.<br>
<br>
Please explain exactly how Guardians are being adjusted. We are all extremely interested to hear what your plans are for them. If you&apos;re planning on making a thread specifically for them please tell us so we can keep an eye out for one.<br>
We will be discussing Guardians (and others) separately. Please keep this thread to Brewmaster discussion. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1055455-brewmasters-in-725/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753776674?page=17#326))<br>

Eye on Battle Pets &#x2014;Do You Even Bunny Hop?<br>
With Noblegarden occurring this month, it seemed like a good time to highlight some of the various rabbit or bunny types of pets that pet battlers can collect &#x2014; including the newest addition the Noblegarden Bunny.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Holiday: New Noblegarden Bunny - Noblegarden kicks off April 16, and you&#x2019;ll be able to purchase a the new Noblegarden Bunny from the holiday vendor for 100 chocolate. It&#x2019;s sure to match your holiday finery so get out there and collect those eggs!<br>
Dungeon Achievement: Hopling - Strange things are happening in the Stormstout Brewery, but to see some of those things, you&#x2019;re going to need a little help from Ling-Ting&#x2019;s Favorite Tea sold by Auntie Stormstout within the dungeon. Collect the golden hoplings tucked in the nooks and crannies of this dungeon and you&#x2019;ll earn the Achievement Ling-Ting&#x2019;s Herbal Journey and a new Hopling companion pet.<br>
Engineering: De-Weaponized Mechanical Companion - You&#x2019;ll either need to be an Engineer to create the De-Weaponized Mechanical Companion (learned from Gnomish Engineering Trainers at 475) or you&#x2019;ll need to make friends with one to add this high-tech companion to your collection. This is a great pet for those with allergies. No fur!<br>
Boss Fight: Darkmoon Rabbit - It looks so cute and fluffy, but don&#x2019;t let the Darkmoon Rabbit fool you. You&#x2019;re going to need to gather a Raid group and head to the Darkmoon Faire to take on this beast. If you&#x2019;re lucky, you&#x2019;ll gain a Darkmoon Rabbit for a companion.<br>
Spawn: Dust Bunny - It doesn&#x2019;t have to be spring to do a little spring cleaning. Just click on the special rugs found around Dalaran to get the Spring Cleaning buff and then go do a little hunting for Dust Bunnies. You&#x2019;ll need to do battle to catch them and your buff will only last for 15 minutes.<br>
Pet Battle: Black Lamb - Alright, so it&#x2019;s not a bunny, but we couldn&#x2019;t resist throwing the Black Lamb into the mix. It&#x2019;s spring after all and it&#x2019;s so cute and fluffy! You&#x2019;ll need to venture into Elwynn Forest to battle for one of these companions. (Good luck Horde players.)<br>
