You can get the full version here (http://pc.ign.com/articles/804/804106p1.html)<br>
<br>
Most important informations are :<br>
Zul&apos;aman loots will be superior to what you can get in Karazhan.<br>
There will be less loots than in Karazhan.<br>
It will be shorter to finish the instance, you can perfectly complete it in one night.<br>
The first boss is the bear god, who can also drops a bear mount. (Very rare drop, as usual)<br>
There will be troll scouts, who will flee once they spot you and will come back with adds if you don&apos;t stop them before they reach the war drums. <br>
The Dragonhawk god uses fire-based attacks and got tons of adds to help. <br>
Nothing new on the final encounter with Zul&apos;jin, he&apos;ll use the different aspects of the previous bosses. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also got a confirmation that the voice chat and guild banks will be released before Zul&apos;aman. Considering that the instance seems pretty much finished, I&apos;d say we can expect it very soon. <br>
<br>
Spectral Tiger<br>
I did a short video with the Spectral Tiger, because it&apos;s definitely way too hard to get proper screenshots of him. The color of the armor on the tiger probably won&apos;t be this one when it&apos;s released.<br>
