Warfront Testing Horde - April 17
We're getting ready to begin our first round of public testing for the new Warfronts feature in Battle for Azeroth, and we'll need your help!

On Tuesday, April 17, starting at 1 PM Pacific time 4 PM Eastern, 10 PM CEST, we'll be enabling the first Warfront for testing. To participate, you'll need to be on a Horde character and head to Zuldazar City, where you'll find a small table you can click on and join the Warfront queue.

We'll be running this test for about 3 hours, and will be watching and participating ourselves, so we hope to see you there! 


Voice Chat Now Available for Testing
Voice chat in the Battle For Azeroth Alpha is now enabled and ready for early testing and feedback.

You'll find the voice chat controls along the left side of the text chat window, and you can configure your devices and push-to-talk in the Voice Chat section of System settings.

Please feel free to post your feedback on this new feature here in this thread.

It's worth noting that voice chat should currently only be available for players in a party channel.

We'll post here with any notable changes as we test.

Windwalker lost Effuse?
Windwalker/Brewmaster will have a basic castable heal as before. It should be back next build. Probably will be called Vivify and not Effuse, to be consistent with the Mistweaver changes so far.
