So why not let us hide EVERYTHING!<br>
Okay! Done.<br>
<br>
Except for the pants.<br>
<br>
I spoke to the development team just now, and they are determined to make this a set of changes that give players ways to hide every slot.<br>
<br>
Except pants.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll let you know as soon as we have details on how that&#x2019;s going to come about in a future update to the game.</div></div>
