PvP Talents - Battle for Azeroth
The latest Beta build added the ability to select your PvP talents, as well as turning on and off War Mode in your faction's capital city. Turning on War Mode grants the Enlisted  buff, giving you 15% more experience for questing and kills. 


  

Yep with the build today guys the PVP talents are finally in the Beta! 

Please keep in mind these are a bit of an early work in progress and we're very eager to hear your feedback on them. Currently nothing is 100% set in stone regarding them so please murder each other and give us your thoughts 

Will there be any updates to the current honor talents to reflect class changes in BFA? Some classes are in desperate need after changes to their class design outside of honor talents. For example windwalker with 45 second cd paralysis is a huge nerf to pvp.
We will be doing some changes to honor talents based upon core class changes to selected classes. We may introduce new honor talents as well where appropriate. That said, I'd caution against expectations of huge sweeping changes or revisions to the current talents. We shouldn't underestimate the possibility of new gameplay surfacing from the fact that you can choose among all of the honor talents in the new system.

It would be good feedback for us to hear how you feel your spec/class has changed in PvP from Legion to now with the new honor talent system and choices available. Stuff like "I'll never take x because you can now get y" or "I'll never take x because of a new core talent added called y."

Thanks for the feedback.


PvP Tiers - Battle for Azeroth
Battle for Azeroth is adding a PvP Tier system for 2v2, 3v3, and RBGs! The listed max rating is likely when you will ascend to the next tier, with the listed min rating for each tier being slightly below when you ascend to that tier to prevent you from dropping back down right away. 


Unranked: 0 - 1400
Combatant: 1375 - 1600
Challenger: 1575 - 1800
Rival: 1775 - 2100
Duelist: 2075 - 2400
Gladiator: 2375+



              

In BfA we are doing some meaningful re-structuring of the PvP itemization system, as well as the ranking system. We're still massaging the system, but we'd like to share some details which may help alleviate some of your concerns. Keep in mind some of this stuff could still change. No pony promises.

New ranking system
We're updating the ranking system to better mirror the other games at Blizzard. WoW via arena is actually one of the first competitive games at Blizzard to have a rating system, so it's fair to say it's time for an update. 

To that end we want to bucket players in rankings similar to StarCraft or Overwatch using labels such as Gold, Platinum etc. We're still going to have our own titles Challenger, Rival, Duelist etc. We feel these rankings have grown to common verbage in the competitive PvP community so we're happy to bring them to WoW. Keep in mind that you'll still be able to see your rating at end of match and within the UI. And we're also looking to add your actual rank in the UI as well as in, you're rank #10 in the region.

New iLevel reward scheme
Similar as in Legion, we're going to reward you with better gear based upon your competitive standing. However, in Legion we rewarded you incrementally in a linear fashion. So as you gained more rating, your iLevel gradually increased. We found this didn't reflect the distribution of players very fairly in terms of appropriate reward for effort in the system. Translation: The iLevel of rewards was generally too low In result we're changing the distribution instead to be something of a bell curve, to match the new ranking system. 

What this means is that players in Challenger/Gold 1600-1800 around will have a chance at ~Normal raid quality loot, Rival/Platinum starting around 1800 with Heroic Raid quality loot, and so on.

Epic Appearances and other rewards
Different rewards will be tied to different rankings. In Legion you got the entire Epic appearance when you hit 2000 rating, in BfA this will be gradually rewarded to you at different ranks. And you will instantly get the look after you achieve that rank, rather than a end of season calculation. 

We totally get the concerns with potentially too broad of brackets. And we definitely agree the competitive spirit often burns brightest at the highest ratings, so it's something we'll be mindful of. Season Gladiator mounts and likely glad titles will still be a % distribution at end of season like in the past, and we could see new rewards for the upper brackets as we shift some of the others Epic appearances downwards. 

Weekly Conquest
As discussed in the past, we're introducing a conquest system based upon past designs. You will earn conquest from doing PvP activities mostly rated, but some also from War Mode that will fill a bar for a reward each week. This is intended to be attractive to the average player. 

One of our biggest goals with the new system is to better align the effort and reward in contrast to all of the other parts of the game, especially at the lower rankings who perhaps in Legion or in the past didn't see it as worth their time. I think we can all agree that more players doing competitive PvP is a worthwhile goal.

We hope to have these systems live in beta soon, and hope to hear your feedback!

Will there be any incentive to do casual BGs? Perhaps a small daily reward of conquest? New system sounds great otherwise.
Our current thought is you'll get a good chunk of conquest for first win of the day Normal Battlegrounds as well as Epic Battlegrounds, as well as a little bit for wins.


Communities - Battle for Azeroth
The start of the community system is in! This system is similar to Blizzard Groups, and actually lets you create Blizzard Groups in game. Unfortunately it doesn't appear to be working just yet. 

Players can be in multiple communities, use the text chat with history, voice chat, roles, calendar invites, and more!


  

    


Raid Testing Schedule - May 11th-14th
On Friday, May 11th we will be conducting raid tests of Uldir. If testing goes well, the majority of Normal mode will remain available over the weekend.

Friday, May 11th

Zek'voz, Herald of N'zoth - Heroic Uldir
13:00 PDT 16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST

G'huun - Heroic Uldir
14:00 PDT 17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST

Friday, May 11th - Monday, May 14th

Normal Uldir

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a Beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.

Q: How do I get into the raid zone?
A: In Zuldazar, Boralus, Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade III in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.
