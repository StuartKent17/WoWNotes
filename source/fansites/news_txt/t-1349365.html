In order to implement our first Connected Realms, Boulderfist and Bloodscalp will be taken down for an extended maintenance beginning Wednesday, September 25, at 3:00 a.m. PDT until approximately 11:00 a.m. PDT. During this time these realms will be unavailable for play. Additional realm connections are planned for the near future, and we&#x2019;ll be posting a full list at WorldofWarcraft.com as soon as we&#x2019;ve finalized the details.<br>

Conquest Points Cap Bug<br>
give everyone full s14 gear - problem solved. <br>
We won&apos;t be granting full Grievous gear to all players, in fact those that acquired gear from the increased cap should not get too fond of holding onto it. We plan on dealing with this matter appropriately, however we cannot elaborate on our plans at this time. <br>
<br>
I&apos;m starting to get very concerned about this, still nothing and it&apos;s been days now. Come on Blizzard, shape up. <br>
We&apos;ll be communicating on our plans as soon&#x2122; as possible. Taking gear away is a very delicate process and one which we definitely don&apos;t want to jump in to, too hastily, the same goes for any other actions we may take. We&apos;ve recently changed the level requirement on the Grievous weapons to ensure that people cannot use them for the time being and we&apos;re looking into what else we can do to resolve this situation. <br>
<br>
We understand that this is a frustrating situation for everyone, but we ask for your patience while we deal with this matter further. I&apos;ve also increased the posting limit for this thread, so please feel free to continue discussing this topic.<br>

Heroes of the Storm Trademark<br>
A &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot; trademark appeared in the New Zealand database tonight, and you can find a fun speculation thread on the forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1349283-Blizzard-trademarks-quot-Heroes-of-the-Storm-quot). <br>
<br>
Keep in mind that this trademark isn&apos;t confirmed just yet. It isn&apos;t likely to be used for a WoW expansion, as the trademark application mentions the software being used on &quot;mobile and cellular phones, laptops, handheld computers, and tablet PCs&quot;.<br>
