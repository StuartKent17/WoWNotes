The Force Awakens in Azeroth<br>
Tonight&apos;s hotfix gives many of the Orgrimmar and Stormwind guards red and blue lightsabers, or as close as you can get in WoW!<br>
<br>

<br>
These aren&#x2019;t the guards you&#x2019;re looking for...<br>
<br>
Some sort of force awakens in both factions!<br>
<br>
We figured we&apos;d pay homage to a galaxy far, far away that has long been near and dear to our geek hearts.<br>
<br>
Stop by Stormwind or Orgrimmar to pay respect to your guards and appreciate their exotic new weapons. They won&apos;t be able to maintain the unfamiliar technology for long!<br>

Quests<br>
<br>
Greatly increased the spawn rates of quest objectives for the following Winter Veil quests: What Horrible Presents!, Grumpus, Menacing Grumplings, and Where are the Children?<br>

<br>

Recent Actions Against Botting in WoW<br>
We&apos;ve recently taken action against a large number of World of Warcraft accounts that were found to be using third-party programs that automate gameplay, known as &#x201C;bots.&#x201D; As a part of this action, we have removed various currencies and inventory from these accounts including, but not limited to, gold, PvP currencies, and gear. The penalty for those identified as repeat offenders has also been increased.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re committed to providing an equal and fair playing field for everyone in World of Warcraft, and will continue to take action against those found in violation of our Terms of Use. Cheating of any form will not be tolerated.<br>
<br>
If you believe that you&#x2019;ve encountered a player abusing a bot, exploit, or cheat, please let us know! You can do so by using the right-click report functionality in the game, and/or by emailing information to hacks@blizzard.com.<br>

Winter Veil Spawn Rates<br>
Reports of unusual gifts not spawning and concerns over grumpling population levels have been forwarded. Hang in there folks, we won&apos;t let Grumpus ruin Winter Veil!<br>
Thanks for bringing this to our attention. The proper people were notified and unusual gifts should now be spawning correctly for the realms where it wasn&apos;t spawning correctly. Additionally, Grumpus and Menacing Grumplings&apos; spawn rates should still be more frequent but at a more appropriate rate now.

Guild Challenge System Changes<br>
So time walking dungeons don&apos;t count then? Or is time walking considered part of this expansion so they do?<br>
No.<br>
<br>
Timewalking dungeons will no longer give guild challenge credit. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/396033-guild-challenge-system-changes/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20042936479?page=1#15))<br>

Will the Winter Veil garrison decorations replace the Hallow&apos;s End ones? Last chance to pick up the previous event&apos;s pets?<br>
You can have either holiday up, but not both at once. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/676470189420974080))<br>
