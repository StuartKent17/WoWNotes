Gearing Up for Apexis Changes in Patch 6.1
In Warlords of Draenor, players can use Apexis Crystals to buy new gear, collectable items, and even Followers. With enough Crystals, even those who are having no luck with the RNG goblins can get new and powerful gear to help them take their adventures in Azeroth even further. Currently, the Apexis traders in the Horde town of Warspear and Alliance town of Stormshield offer gear up to item level 655, but in Patch 6.1, you’ll be able to trade up to ilvl 670 Ethereal http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=ethereal&filter-ilvl-min=670&filter-ilvl-max=670 Waist, Head, Wrist, Legs, Hands, Back, and Finger ring items.

There are already lots of ways to get Apexis Crystals, and with the patch we’re introducing even more in the form of new Missions and purchasable Scouting Missives, which will be available for 200 Garrison Resources each. These Missives can be purchased in your Garrison and will unlock an additional Apexis Crystal daily quest.

A change to questing is also coming with the patch that makes it so players will no longer be able to work on quests and complete them while in a Raid group though Apexis Crystals will still drop from enemies. You’ll still be able to use the Group Finder tool to locate five-player groups you can join to complete your Apexis dailies.

I've noticed that a big majority of passives are completely hidden after 6.0 came out, makes no sense to hide them all

Could you buff 4t17 for rdruids? 25% Mana of a WG is less than a the subsequent HT costs and 2pc is better used on RG
This is an interesting case where different healers favor different healing styles, & some fit the set bonus, while some don’t. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/564953564057829376
It's a case of a set bonus being simply bad. 25% of a WG doesn't cover even a single HT, let alone two of them.
Why are you making that comparison? You're not losing the Healing Touches' healing. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/565009278394564608
Because you do not have GCD's for chaincasting HT's during high raiddamage, and during low raiddamage 1/2
You're saying that it's not worth using on it's own. But that's not the point. It doesn't need to be. It can still be... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/565336467686567936
...valuable for the free mana savings when you do 2x HT anyway, which some healing styles do use. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/565336771496792065
Isn't the whole problem "2x HT anyway". When would you ever do that? 2pc also allows for NS on 2 additional Regrowth
That seems like the crux of your complaint. You don't use 2x HT. Others do. That's OK. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/565350370755764225

Hey guys, any chance in 6.1 hunter guns can sound more "gun" rather than "pulling the trigger on empty ammo" clicking sound

in 6.1 may we please have a golden border to frostbolt in combat when fast cast frostbolt is avail? Important for DF timing.
We’d consider that, but it may also be annoying having a constant glowing Frostbolt button while not actively fighting. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/564972537696645121

Are you worried about frost mage scaling? Arcane/Fire are on par/passing frost already. Frostbolt is still meh.
