Gearing Up for Apexis Changes in Patch 6.1
In Warlords of Draenor, players can use Apexis Crystals to buy new gear, collectable items, and even Followers. With enough Crystals, even those who are having no luck with the RNG goblins can get new and powerful gear to help them take their adventures in Azeroth even further. Currently, the Apexis traders in the Horde town of Warspear and Alliance town of Stormshield offer gear up to item level 655, but in Patch 6.1, you’ll be able to trade up to ilvl 670 Ethereal  Waist, Head, Wrist, Legs, Hands, Back, and Finger ring items.

There are already lots of ways to get Apexis Crystals, and with the patch we’re introducing even more in the form of new Missions and purchasable Scouting Missives, which will be available for 200 Garrison Resources each. These Missives can be purchased in your Garrison and will unlock an additional Apexis Crystal daily quest.

A change to questing is also coming with the patch that makes it so players will no longer be able to work on quests and complete them while in a Raid group though Apexis Crystals will still drop from enemies. You’ll still be able to use the Group Finder tool to locate five-player groups you can join to complete your Apexis dailies.

Draenai Paladins+Priests CANT use racial if they are locked in holy school while Rshamans mwmonks canfix plz #bug
This is consistent with how school lockouts work, so it's not a bug. Gift of the Naaru is a Holy school spell. WarcraftDevs

Why can enrage be dispelled? enrage is a state of emotion not a magical effect.
It’s not a magical effect, but someone can certainly try to calm you down. WarcraftDevs 

Anything on the promised race/class combination unlock look that was promised in interview for 6.1?
New race/class combos are something we consider for new expansions, generally not in content patches. WarcraftDevs 

Hello sir! Can you confirm or deny all the flutter going on about Gnome Hunters coming for 6.1?
Not something for 6.1, but it is something we're considering for the future. WarcraftDevs 

I've noticed that a big majority of passives are completely hidden after 6.0 came out, makes no sense to hide them all
We hide a few passives when the changes they provide aren't relevant to making decisions. Theorycrafters can find them online. WarcraftDevs 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Any chance you could make the Death Strike icon light up when a DK has a Dark Succor proc?
Not sure that we’ll be able to get this in for 6.1, but it sounds like a good idea. WarcraftDevs 

litchbourne makes dks "undead" byproduct=fear immune,turn evil turns undead not technically fear does not work on dks? bug?
Not technically a bug; it doesn't really make you undead anymore, just provides those immunities and enables Death Coil. WarcraftDevs 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Could you buff 4t17 for rdruids? 25% Mana of a WG is less than a the subsequent HT costs and 2pc is better used on RG
This is an interesting case where different healers favor different healing styles, & some fit the set bonus, while some don’t. WarcraftDevs 
It's a case of a set bonus being simply bad. 25% of a WG doesn't cover even a single HT, let alone two of them.
Why are you making that comparison? You're not losing the Healing Touches' healing. Celestalon 
Because you do not have GCD's for chaincasting HT's during high raiddamage, and during low raiddamage 1/2
You're saying that it's not worth using on it's own. But that's not the point. It doesn't need to be. It can still be... Celestalon 
...valuable for the free mana savings when you do 2x HT anyway, which some healing styles do use. Celestalon 
Isn't the whole problem "2x HT anyway". When would you ever do that? 2pc also allows for NS on 2 additional Regrowth
That seems like the crux of your complaint. You don't use 2x HT. Others do. That's OK. Celestalon 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Hey guys, any chance in 6.1 hunter guns can sound more "gun" rather than "pulling the trigger on empty ammo" clicking sound 
We changed gun sounds in 6.0 based on player feedback during Mists. Feedback about them now, though, is noted and appreciated! WarcraftDevs 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
in 6.1 may we please have a golden border to frostbolt in combat when fast cast frostbolt is avail? Important for DF timing.
We’d consider that, but it may also be annoying having a constant glowing Frostbolt button while not actively fighting. WarcraftDevs 

Are you worried about frost mage scaling? Arcane/Fire are on par/passing frost already. Frostbolt is still meh.
We're keeping an eye on it, but not currently seeing a problem. WarcraftDevs 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Is it a bug that Windwalker clones stand still during FoF while using glyph "Floating Butterfly"?
No, this is intended. Floating Butterfly only benefits yourself. WarcraftDevs 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
So why doesn't Arcane Torrent give Shadow Priests a Shadow Orb? It works for all the non-cloth.
No change to announce currently, but we’ll discuss it. WarcraftDevs 

Is there a chance to remove the automatic facing from Mind Flay and Sear and Penance? It is really annoying on situations c
There’s actually a hidden UI option to disable that for advanced users. /console cameraSmoothTrackingStyle 0 WarcraftDevs

Healing debuff baked into Assassination deadly poison please. It's needed for competitive arena play as Mut spec.
No plans for this currently, but why do you feel that Wound Poison doesn't fulfill this need? WarcraftDevs 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Glyph of Ghostly Speed only works if activated in mountable area both instance/world. Is that a bug? 
No, it’s intended. A minor glyph was not intended to give you indoor mounted speed. WarcraftDevs 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
For a while now the Warlock Glyph, Glyph of Felgaurd has been broken you cant morph Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros any word on fix
Glyph of Felguard is intentionally unable to equip Legendary weapons. WarcraftDevs 

Please, could we have a minor glyph to reduce pet size from warlocks ?
We appreciate the suggestion! No plans for this at the moment, but we'll keep it in mind. WarcraftDevs 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Is it intended that Sweeping Strikes only transfers 20% of the damage dealt by Bladestormshould be 50%?
1 Sweeping Strikes off of AoE spells like Bladestorm & Whirlwind actually do 50% Weapon Damage . . . WarcraftDevs 
2 . . instead of 50% of the damage done so that it doesn’t scale with target count. WarcraftDevs 

Character / Items
How will the Heirloom tab work with the Garrosh BoAs? I have e.g. the 2h axe on normal, heroic and mythic. 
Only the most prestigious version of each Garrosh heirloom that you own will show up in your Heirlooms collection. WarcraftDevs 

I hate what you've done to caster trinkets. Every dps str, agi has their own. Why casters share with heals? Too unfair.
What makes you say that? They don't, other than that they CAN use them. Healers have their own trinkets though. Celestalon 

Understand Tickle Totem being behind a rep to get. May I suggest once you have it in Toy Box useable by all or Horde alts
We’ll look into it, thanks for the suggestion. WarcraftDevs 

PvE
Bosses in BRF should drop more than 9 Fragments? People including myself reporting getting 27 Runes tuesday but only 9 after
Usually 9, rarely 27. Just like how sometimes you’d get clusters in Highmaul. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
Hello there! Any changes planned to adress NPC difficulty in Alterac Valley? Most mobs appear weaker then usual bowmen etc
Some of the NPCs in Alterac Valley have had their health increased in 6.1. WarcraftDevs 

what is the significance of the display "enemies slain" inside ashran? how does it work out? is it an objective?
Once you reach the number required, a faction captain will spawn at your base to assist you in your fight. WarcraftDevs 

Any fix for these Ashran afkers preventing people who want to PVP from joining? It's infuriating that this is a thing
If there are people waiting to get into Ashran, AFK players are removed from the zone. WarcraftDevs 

Are BG holiday weekends going to be returning anytime soon?
No plans to have them return any time soon. WarcraftDevs

will the 125 stat food recipes make more than 1 per craft? Seems very expensive if not.
The 125 stat cooking recipes will have a chance to create 1 additional food based on your skill. WarcraftDevs 

World Events
Are you happy with how 'They Really Love Me' turned out? Any plans to change it before the holiday is over?
The griefing potential due to an aura channeling issue was a top message, we've gotten the feedback, improving on it for sure. Muffinus 

Darkmoon Faire Race
Oh so its kinda of a soft buff to your ability to finish it on time?
Yep! It will get easier as the months pass. Muffinus 

Misc
Hey has there been any word on a fix for Guild Dungeon runs randomly not counting for gold in the guild bank?
We believe we have a fix for this issue in 6.1. WarcraftDevs
