Itemization Quality/Chance Hotfixes Coming Soon
We’re preparing a hotfix to be deployed during next week’s downtime, which will make a few changes in time for the new raid week.

This hotfix will:
Triple the chance that a Mythic dungeon item can upgrade to Warforged. As a reminder, when a Mythic dungeon item is Warforged which can drop from any Mythic dungeon boss, the item level is increased from 685 to 705. Increase the number of set pieces that drop from set bosses in Normal and Heroic Hellfire Citadel. This will affect both personal loot and group loot. Increase the chance of getting an item when using a Seal of Tempered Fate.

We’ll be pushing a separate hotfix live today that will double the chance that a Timewarped item drops as Warforged, which increases its ilvl at level 100 from 660 to 675.

Also Tempered fate not inevitable?
Correct. It's a catch up change.

The doubled chance for Warforged Timewarped items is now live.


Timewalker Dungeon Feedback
-Fix Righteous Fury so it doesn't unapply by entering and exiting a dungeon.
Most buffs are cleared when entering Timewalking, similar to Arena. This is necessary to ensure that the down-scaling that occurs when you enter the dungeon is done cleanly.

-Fix the Dungeon Finder's "Find new players" option so people arent absolutely boned by leavers
This is a bug we're actively working to address. The Dungeon Finder should be trying to refill groups for you.

-Is there any way to make Barrage stupid proof? please? Like, replace it with how volley used to be cast instead of every damned thing in front of the hunter.
Ideally people understand how their AoEs work before using them freely. We're always keeping an eye on things though.

-Add a bag that you can get for completing your first random timewalker for the day that drops a 660 piece and a chance at some pets and maybe a mount. Give the players a 'choo-choo train" so its a little easier to digest this... thing.
We're at least doubling the chance that a Timewarped item will drop as Warforged. That should feel a little better?

The feedback is appreciated and we're always happy to clarify how things function, whether intended or not, whenever we can. It'd be cool, though, to sometimes not read that feedback with such incendiary statements as "the failure that it is" or "make it stupid proof."

From my perspective it just makes filtering through feedback more cumbersome. There's more stuff to sift through in general, and then I have to try and weight the hyperbole against the legitimacy of the feedback.

You're passionate about the game and you're coming here to let us know about some things that frustrated you with a new system. I get it. That's cool. I just wish it could stay as simple as that, with less emphasis on the dramatic.

In any event, the thread is about Timewalking, and there are some improvements and fixes in order. Hopefully they help.


Blue Tweets
Character / Items
Do you still do toys? The Contender's Costumes can't be removed manually - you have to wait out the debuff time.
If you could remove it manually, as soon as you were losing, you'd right-click it off, unfair to the other players. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/612496766001254401

PvP
Sha of Anger isn't the same as pre-fly pvp. People didn't fight in TM and SS because they'd get honor points or loot.
.Do you think TM vs. SS world pvp pre-honor can ever return to WoW? Why or why not? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/612497210706542592
