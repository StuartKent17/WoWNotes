Boubouille2009-05-14, 09:18 PMChanges to Items with Stealth Detection
We recently made some changes to items that grant stealth detection. We felt these items provided a necessary advantage in competitive PVP and forced players to use lower level equipment even when more powerful items were available to them.

This item can no longer be used in the Arena:
Ultra-Spectropic Detection Goggles http://www.wowhead.com/?item=23762

We have removed stealth detection from the following items:
All epic engineering goggles

We have reduced the stealth detection of the following items:
Catseye Ultra Goggles http://www.wowhead.com/?item=10501
Blood Guard's Dragonhide Gauntlets http://www.wowhead.com/?item=16496
Marshal's Dragonhide Gauntlets http://www.wowhead.com/?item=16448
Knight-Lieutenant's Dragonhide Gloves http://www.wowhead.com/?item=16397
General's Dragonhide Gloves http://www.wowhead.com/?item=16555
Bloodvine Lens http://www.wowhead.com/?item=19998
Knight-Lieutenant's Dragonhide Grips http://www.wowhead.com/?item=23280
Blood Guard's Dragonhide Grips http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22863
The Night Watchman http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31333

All of these changes are already active and the tooltips will be updated with the next minor patch.

Blizzcon tickets on sale Saturday 16th
Just to elaborate, we don't have an exact time on when they will be up but our web engineers will need to be here to properly start and monitor the system when it goes live so we don't plan to be doing that in the middle of the night.

Free Character Moves
There were a lot of issues with realms queuing a little while back, especially at the launch of Wrath of the Lich King, so Free Character Moves were constantly available to players. Overall the queues are not a big issue right now so we have no had many FCMs lately and generally it takes some really nasty conditions like being stuck in a login queue for over an hour to really convince people to transfer to a new realm.

We are keeping an eye on things though and working on improving things as always. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17162146657-any-new-free-xfers-planned.html

More than 2 Professions at the same time?
We like the idea that players get to choose their professions and not just collect them all. This way players are picking the top 2 that they want or feel are best for their class and not just rampaging through everything for the sake of it. If we did allow players to have more than 2 professions then at the same time we would probably have to limit the perks you get through professions as it would be a big advantage for anybody who has more of them too.
