7.0.3 Launch Tuning Hotfixes
Greetings. Over the last day or two, we've applied a multitude of changes for tuning prior to 7.0.3 launch. Usually during betas, the community largely determines changes through datamining and comparing what changed between builds. But with hotfixes, that's much harder. Once we launch, we'll follow our normal procedures of posting hotfix notes, but for this last round of tuning before launch, I've listed what changed below.

Note that this is the tuning we're doing for 7.0.3 launch, but we will of course adjust after launch if needed. The goal is for all classes and specs to be viable, so if any prove not to be, rest assured that we will continue iterating.

Theorycrafting Questions
Does a 1sec Renewing Mist partial-tick have half the chance to proc Uplifting Trance as a 2sec full tick i.e. proc chance scales with tick duration, or are the proc chances equal?
Currently has a full chance to proc. Not likely to be an issue, but if it becomes one i.e. haste breakpoints start to matter, we can prorate the proc chance on a partial tick.

Off the top of my head, the only periodic I can think of where we currently do this is Doom.
Will we go live with the 750ms GCD floor or was that changed again in the meantime?
That's still in place.

Backdraft, Destruction Warlock first tier Talent. If I wear no gear, the duration of the Buff is 5 seconds as statted in the tooltip. However, if I wear some haste, the duration is decreased e.g. the Duration scales with haste. Is this intended?
It is--the rhythm of how you use the talent knowing that, say, after a Conflag, you can cast 3 hasted Incinerates should remain the same regardless of your gear level. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Holy Priest Feedback -- Legion Beta Feedback
A recent tuning hotfix should have increased both the proc rate and healing done by Invoke the Naaru. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
