Oondasta and Nalak Loot Eligibility Change<br>
Back in early March we made a hotfix to remove loot and bonus roll eligibility for players that defeated Oondasta and Nalak while visiting from a different realm. At the time, the change was made to address realm stability issues. Since then, we&#x2019;ve address those issues by making tuning adjustments for Oondasta such as increasing the spawn rate, and reducing Oondasta&#x2019;s health by 50%.<br>
<br>
In an upcoming hotfix, players coalesced from a different realm will be eligible to receive loot or use a bonus roll after defeating Oondasta or Nalak once more. Keep in mind, players are still only eligible to receive loot or use a bonus roll once a week.<br>
<br>
This change will take effect in each region after their scheduled weekly realm maintenance.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mogu Rune of Fate &#x2013; Lesser Charm Change<br>
We&#x2019;re deploying a hotfix late tonight that will reduce the number of Lesser Charms of Good Fortune required to purchase 3 Mogu Runes of Fate from 90 down to 50. Meaning when you log in Wednesday and purchase your 3 Mogu Runes of Fate, which are used for 5.2 raid boss bonus rolls, it will only cost you 50 Lesser Charms.<br>
<br>
We recommend waiting until after the scheduled Wednesday maintenance to ensure this change has gone through before purchasing your Runes.<br>

In addition, activation rate for Fire Mages has been increased.<br>

Upcoming Pet Passive Changes<br>
We&apos;re going to be buffing some pet passives in a future patch, and elementals are on the list. We feel that the elemental passive is currently too confusing in that it is somewhat ambiguous with regard to direct effects of weather, but not effects that are not directly related to weather.<br>
<br>
For example, if your opponent has a pet that gains an additional attack in a Blizzard, they will still get the additional attack against your elemental pet. This can feel bad in some cases and we want pet passives to always feel good and useful. We also feel that weather is one of the more fun and synergistic elements of Pet Battles, so at this point in time, we&#x2019;re thinking of redesigning the elemental pet passive along the lines of a ~50% reduction in damage for the turn one is swapped in. Our goal being that we&#x2019;d rather have a passive in place that increases the strategic depth of elemental pets, and is clear in its intention and functionality.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, we&#x2019;re still evaluating the numbers and everything is subject to change, but we&#x2019;d sincerely appreciate any constructive feedback you may have! <br>

Patch 5.3 Experience Changes<br>
How will it work...<br>
<br>
Scenario 1:<br>
<br>
Before the patch: Character has 50/200 xp, xp bar shows 25% progress to next level.<br>
After the patch: Character has 50/100 xp, xp bar shows 50% progress to next level.<br>
<br>
<br>
Scenario 2:<br>
<br>
Before the patch: Character has 102/200 xp, xp bar shows 51% progress to next level.<br>
After the patch: Character has 102/100 xp, and will level as soon as they gain an experience point.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me know if that helps. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/259121-53-mop-xp-lowered-please/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8569150117?page=9#173))<br>

World PvP and Gear<br>
That is referring to world PvP. In world PvP, those in full Conquest gear &quot;should be pretty competitive with a Heroic raid&#x2013;geared player&#x2014;they may have more survivability, but you might do more damage.&quot; In instanced PvP, such as Arena and Battlegrounds the player in PvP gear will have an upper hand, and the player with PvE gear has the better equipment for dungeons and raids.<br>
<br>
I hope this clears that up, the devs are referring to world PvP specifically and not PvP in general. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/259259-ask-the-devs-possible-pvp-change-53/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7356256172?page=1#3))<br>

Ask the Devs Questions<br>
Mobius, to answer your question as to why your question was not taken: <br>
<br>
Any changes planned for DKs? Like removing the rp cost from Icebound Fortitude or removing the health loss every 2 sec from Unholy Frenzy. <br>
As you can see, the question is not about the planned changes for patch 5.3. For those that are complaining that you aren&apos;t satisfied with the questions we responded to, take into consideration the following things:<br>
<br>
Did you ask a question? We only took questions that were posted in the Ask the Devs thread. If you don&apos;t ask, we can&apos;t answer. Was your question about the patch 5.3 changes relating to PvP? If not, then it was not taken because it broke one of the first rules for the Ask the Devs Did you up-vote questions you wanted to see answered? The highest voted questions were the ones we chose.<br>
<br>
There were many questions that were able to be asked about the 5.3 changes for PvP. There was a new battleground, a new arena, many class changes that would affect PvP and as can be seen, resilience changes. No questions were avoided, if they met the rules of the thread and were voted for, then they were chosen.<br>
<br>
The major things which are constanly posted about here and on the usa forums: too much burst, too much cc +remove the pve trinkets, are simply ignored. <br>
There are actually responses to all three of those. The Devs spoke about CC, the PvE trinkets and the burst they create. Unfortunately, if you check the Ask the Devs thread, there are no questions which actually asked about the 5.3 changes and the way in which they would address burst, outside of those pertaining to the Shado-Pan trinkets. If you wanted an answer specifically to the ways in which 5.3 was planning to address your particular issues with burst, then you should have asked them.

Tier 15 Interview With Method<br>
Manaflask has once again interviewed Method about their thoughts on this tier of content. You can see the hightlights below, or read the full interview on Manaflask (http://manaflask.com/en/articles/the-throne-is-method-s-a-post-t15-25-man-victory-interview).<br>
<br>
<br>
10 and 25 player difficulties are different races due to the different difficulty of the bosses in each size.<br>
Due to the difficulty differences, Method no longer feels like they are directly competing against Paragon anymore.<br>
The lack of any gating was nice, as was the longer period of pure progression. <br>
The boss tuning was well done in this tier, with the exception of Twin Consorts (which was hotfixed).<br>
Lei Shen was well tuned, well designed, and one of the better encounters in the game.<br>
Ra-den was significantly easier than Lei Shen, and really was a bonus boss rather than the &quot;final boss&quot; of the tier.<br>
The opinion on limited attempts on Ra-den was split, with some guild members liking it and some disliking it. <br>
Everyone agreed that Dark Animus was the most frustrating boss due to the wipes early in the fight.<br>
Method raided 14-16 hours a day during much of the progression.<br>
