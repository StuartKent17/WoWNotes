Harvest Festival Live Through September 17th<br>
The Harvest Festival is now live until Septmber 17th on both retail and classic WoW. This quest is fairly easy (using an item at each fallen idol&apos;s resting place) and rewards a whopping 6600 experience in classic so it&apos;s a good one to do before it ends!<br>
The yearly Harvest Festival is now underway in Azeroth. This is a solemn time when the Alliance honors Uther the Lightbringer by lighting a candle at his tomb in the Western Plaguelands, while members of the Horde show their respect to Grommash Hellscream by leaving a bottle of spirits at the base of the Hellscream Memorial in Demon Fall Canyon in Ashenvale.<br>
<br>
When: September 10-17<br>
Where: Outside Ironforge and Orgrimmar<br>
<br>
Commemorate those who have sacrificed their lives to help friends and allies. Feasts are also held outside Ironforge and Orgrimmar in honor of these fallen heroes.<br>
