Boubouille2007-12-05, 07:40 AMTons of 2.3.2 news ! I don't know why these changes went unnoticed to be honest. Some of the Zul'aman items models have been changed probably in the original 2.3.2 patch 2 weeks ago and Spinesever has been nerfed Latest PTR Build I think.

2.3.2 - Earth shield changes reverted.
Just temporarily until they find out how to address the dispel issue.
In the current version of patch 2.3.2 we added a 30 second cooldown to earth shield and lowered the mana cost by approximately 50%. We have decided to temporarily revert both of these changes until we address the dispel issue, which will likely be for patch 2.4.

In short, earth shield will not be changed in patch 2.3.2.

The off-hand Whirlwind attack does not proc flurry when it crits.
If you have one charge of flurry remaining and crit with that attack, flurry does not proc/refresh

Both bugs will be fixed in a patch after 2.3.2
