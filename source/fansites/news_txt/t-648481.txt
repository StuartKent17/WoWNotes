Boubouille2009-05-13, 07:09 PMUpdate - Added a few screenshots of Patch 3.1.2 10-Man Hard Mode weapons and today's blue posts.

Ulduar 10-Player Hard Mode Weapons Update
In order to better reward players for completing hard mode encounters in 10-player Ulduar, we will be updating weapon rewards from these hard mode encounters to an item level of 232 in the next minor patch. Players already with these items should see an increase in the power of these items to better reflect the new item level. 
Below are a few screenshots of weapons with their new stats.

Blue posts
Herald of the Titans http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=3316 Changes
In this minor content patch, we'll be updating this achievement from the item level 226 requirement to an item level 232 requirement. Bear in mind that the description text of the achievement in the client will likely not be updated in this patch and will still reflect the outdated data.

Wintergrasp ... a failure?
I think it's a little early for such a prediction based on the announced change to Lake Wintergrasp quests. We're looking into, and working on many different potential ways to keep Wintergrasp and our battlegrounds fun, engaging, and both great means of obtaining honor.

It was referred to as a failure and future ghost town before the expansion released. Clearly that hasn't been the case, but we've learned how the design and appeal of the zone can lead to performance issues if too many players are crowded into a relatively small space. Our ultimate goal is not to make the zone less appealing, but to increase the appeal of battlegrounds and change the way questing in Wintergrasp works to hopefully throttle the participation in any given battle.

We very much like the zone and we want it to be functional above all else. The game play inevitably suffers when performance issues arise and it's our goal to address this from as many different angles as possible, none of which include implementing solutions to ensure "no one will want to go anymore."

We encourage players to provide us feedback on battleground queues and team balancing i.e. matches starting with uneven numbers on each faction, and Lake Wintergrasp performance and honor viability once 3.1.2 is released.

Honor gain in Battlegrounds
This is something we're visiting to some extent for the next major content patch. We want all of the battlegrounds to be as close as possible with regards to honor gains, and we want the length of individual matches in every battleground to be roughly the same. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16904078847-of-battlegrounds-and-honor.html

10/25 Man Dungeons
The problem with this is that the people who want to do bigger 25 player raids would complain when only 10 player raids are available as we wouldn't have reached the 25 player ones yet, and then vice versa when we are adding the 25 player raid dungeons and ignoring 10 player raids. Making a raid dungeon is a lot of work and not something that is easy to complete.

We went with this new model as it allows a progression path for players who want to do just 10 player raids and for those who want to do just 25 player raids. All players also get to experience all of the content that we worked on in the way that works best for them. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16903520036-so-now-we-do-25p--.html

Alterac Valley
We did everything but neglect Alterac Valley. We tested and experimented with numerous changes until we got it to a point where we feel matches can be completed in a reasonable amount of time, while the overall zone is still enjoyable and rewarding for the time spent there. We do agree that some of the changes made have diminished the need to engage enemy players a little too much. We also understand that Alterac Valley matches are the most prone to starting with uneven numbers on either side right now, but that's an issue to be addressed via the queuing system and functionality.

There are ways we'll be looking to bring back some pretty epic battles in our next battleground as well as improve the queuing system, but there are no major changes planned for Alterac Valley at this time, particularly not for those who want it reverted to the original version.

Crusaders can't run their Valiant daily quests
While you aren't the only one, I turned in my tokens so I have less to do and wanted the Crusader title asap. We do plan to make some changes to how this works in a future patch that will smooth this out a bit. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/16904076349-why-are-we-punished-for-being-crusaders.html

Q: Will people outside of the United States be able to purchase the online stream and receive the in-game pet?
A: Yes, but there may be some limitations on countries that can do this. We will post more details regarding this when the online stream is available for purchase. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/25/16903578182-post-questions-here--also-questions-faqs.html

Unholy DPS too high?
We think Unholy dps is probably too high on fights with adds, which ends up being a lot of Ulduar bosses. From looking at the numbers, the main culprit seems to be using Death and Decay, Unholy Blight, Pestilence and Blood Boil all together. None of those are a problem alone, but they work really well together. Unholy Blight is the spell we would most likely change. It has never really found a niche.

Fury DPS to be increased
We are likely to buff warrior dps slightly in PvE. Fury likely needs more than Arms, but our intent for now is also to buff Arms a little. Our intent could change of course.

We don't have any specific changes to announce. Do not expect to see a 20% jump in your numbers. Please do not interpret this as the class, stances or rage mechanics being re-designed. Look at our recent change to Lightning Overload as the kind of thing we might implement. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16903633680-warrior-dps-is-unacceptably-low-in-31.html
