I guess I&apos;ll have to postpone the naked elves for a few days. <br>

Winter Veil patterns fix<br>
Blizzard wishes you a merry christmas (Well actually this post is a few days old but nobody watches the customer services forum) ! Missing Winter Veil patterns are getting fixed, and they&apos;ll just be sold in Ironforge and Orgrimmar once the hotfix is applied to servers.<br>
We certainly do care about our players and plan on making the recipes available before the holiday is at an end. Penney Copperpinch (Orgrimmar) and Wulmort Jinglepocket (Ironforge) will most likely be our vehicles to do so. However, this is one of those fixes that cannot be hotfixed as easily as others. Not every issue can be rectified on a realm while it&apos;s up and running, unfortunately.<br>
<br>
The next time we do rolling restarts (scheduled for Tuesday at this time), you should hopefully be able to retrieve the recipes you desire from those NPCs.<br>
<br>
There&apos;s no minimum skill level to purchase the recipes off the vendor, so don&apos;t worry there. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3466327626&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=16#306))<br>
