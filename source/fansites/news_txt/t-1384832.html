The Blizzcon schedule (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/634-Blizzcon-2013) has some interesting changes to the team working on different games, including the return of Furor to WoW.<br>
<br>
World of Warcraft Team<br>
<br>
Alex Afrasiabi (Furor) - He started out as a Quest Designer, then Lead Quest Designer up until WoTLK, then Lead World Designer in Cataclysm, then he disappeared after Tigole announced he was moving to another project (Titan), but he is apparently now back as Creative Director for the next expansion!<br>
Craig Amai - He was a previously a Game Designer, and is now the Lead Quest Designer for the next expansion.<br>
Dave Kosak - He was previously Lead Quest Designer, and is now the Lead Narrative Designer for the next expansion.<br>
<br>
<br>
Heroes of the Storm Team<br>
<br>
Dustin Browder - He was Game Director for StarCraft II, and is now Game Director for Heroes of the Storm<br>
Matt Cooper - He was Game Balance Designer for StarCraft II, and is now Game Designer on Heroes of the Storm<br>
Richard Khoo - He was Game Designer on StarCraft II, and is now Senior Game Designer on Heroes of the Storm<br>
Alexander Sun - He was on the Web Team, then Game Designer on StarCraft II, and is now Senior Game Designer on Heroes of the Storm<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor Domain Changed<br>
The WarlordsofDraenor.com domain we mentioned (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3499-Blizzard-Trademarks-Warlords-of-Draenor-WoW-Expansion) last week changed early this afternoon to a Forbidden error from the domain parking page previously used. <br>
<br>
It also is now pointed to an IP address that Blizzard owns. Keep in mind that anyone can purchase a domain and point it to a Blizzard IP, as those servers currently respond to requests for any domain.<br>
