PvP Holy Word: Chastise will no longer remove periodic damaging effects from targets in PvE situations.


Dungeons

Black Rook Hold

Fel Vomit from the Smashspite the Hateful encounter in Black Rook Hold will no longer persist after the encounter is defeated.



Items

The secondary stats on Legion gems have been significantly decreased.

Developers’ notes: Gems are not in the same place as they were in previous expansions. They’re a bit too powerful, and this was not intended. Sockets are still quite valuable and will continue to be so, but we need to reduce the difference between an item having a socket vs. not having a socket.



PvP

Ashran

Ashran Dominance now rewards 500 honor for completion.
Slay Them All now rewards 200 honor for completion.

Honor awarded from skirmishes has been tripled.


Professions

Enchanting Rank 2 and Rank 3 recipes now have the “Requires Previous Rank” text.
Mass Prospecting should now return the same amount of gems as normal Prospecting.


Quests

Players can now complete "WANTED: Shara Felbreath" after leaving combat and returning.
Enemies should now have lower health and damage in Chapter 3 of the Warrior Class Hall scenario.
A marker on your map should now appear for the objective of the Stormheim quest “The Trials Continue”.
Marksman hunters who left Niskara without talking to Vereesa can speak to her at Krassus' Landing to complete the "Rescue Mission" quest.
The Mage Order Campaign quest "What Is Going On Here" objectives should now complete reliably.


Suramar

Blackhawk's Bulwark PvP Captains should respawn more quickly.
Fel Cannons in Felsoul Hold should respawn more quickly.
