Arena Season 2 Stats
New season is now scheduled for 19th June.
Ilvl went from 123 to 136, there isn't much change to the stats, you just get more "normal" stats, most of the set bonuses don't change and "special" bonuses on some parts aren't upgraded. For the moment, only one set stats are available.

 

Arena Season 2 + New Honor items skins
New honor items will be added with the new arena ones. If you buy everything, you'll end up with a recolored tier 5 armor. I updated all the sets with ingame screenshots no more missing glows or bugged textures, all items are included. 


     
     
     
 

"Old" PvP price changes
Arena Season 1 items will still be available in the next patch, with lowered prices. Season 2 Items will have the same price as current season 1 ones. 
Honor-bought items also got their prices lowered.

New Skins
New SSC / Karazhan / Gruul's Lair skins 
Overall, you won't get brand-new visuals on off-set items dropped in raid dungeons, mostly models of the set of the same tier than the one that drop in the dungeon. 

New Quests/Events
Ezra's quest  is in the patch. Full story here  and here 

L70ETC has been added to the game, to play a 4 minutes long song in the Darkmoon Faire. 
The symbol on the drums is "L70ETC," which stands for Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftain. This is the same band that did the "The Power of the Horde" metal track in WarCraft 3: The Frozen Throne. They were called Level 10 Elite Tauren Chieftain then, and changed their name to Level 60 Elite Tauren Chieftain when WoW came out. They also played Blizzcon the last year it was held.
