It seems that the Dark Phoenix mount is fairly popular these days, here is a short video of how the model looks. As a reminder, the Dark Phoenix will be rewarded through the new Guild Achievement/Rewards system, you will have to unlock it via a Guild Achievement, have enough reputation with your guild to buy it, and of course, enough gold.

Archaeology Preview
There isn't much known about Archaeology at this point but a couple of spells and some extra information have been added to the game files. Even if Path of the Titans is gone it looks like the main idea behind Archaeology remains the same and you will have to hunt for artifacts throughout the world. 

Rewards
The only thing we know about Archaeology rewards is from the Press Tour 2 months ago, rewards are known to be "cosmetic only" like pets, or toys, but a few of them will have actual effects. We really don't know much more but a few people speculated that the Skeletal Raptor Mount  and Skeletal Raptor Pet  might be Archaeology rewards. It would make sense, with the "Fossil" research branch in the game files. But again, this is pure speculation at this point


Research Branch
It seems that the profession includes multiple research branches: 


Dwarf
Draenei
Fossil
Night Elf
Nerubian
Orc
Tol'vir
Troll
Vrykul
Other



Research Sites
The known research sites are: 


Stone Cairn Dig Site Elwynn Forest
Ironband's Excavation Site Loch Modan
Ironbeard's Tomb Wetlands
Whelgar's Excavation Site Wetlands
Greenwarden's Fossil Bank Wetlands
Circle of Inner Binding Arathi Highlands
Circle of West Binding Arathi Highlands
Circle of East Binding Arathi Highlands
Circle of Outer Binding Arathi Highlands
Witherbark Dig Site Arathi Highlands
Thandol Span Arathi Highlands/Wetlands
Dun Garok Dig Site Hillsbrad Foothills
Shindra'Alor Dig Site Hinterlands
Altar of Zul Dig Site Hinterlands
Jintha'Alor Lower City Dig Site Hinterlands
Jintha'Alor Upper City Dig Site Hinterlands
Agol'watha Dig Site Hinterlands


It looks like only the Dwarf branch of archeology is implemented for the moment, and it's most likely not complete. 


Trainers
Of course.


 


Spells
These spells are part of the Archaeology profession.

We removed the prereq chain from Divine Illumination to Aura Mastery and Light of Dawn. We had the prerq in there to make sure paladins didn't skip over a powerful group utility talent in a perhaps selfish attempt to enhance their personal healing per second, but we do acknowledge that it is far less useful in say 5-player dungeons.
