On this fantastic day of April 1st, Blizzard unveiled the latest addition to World of Warcraft: Pimp My Mount! (https://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/underdev/mount-p1mpage.html)!<br>
Tired of your mount looking like every other raptor, wolf, horse, kodo, or nightsaber out there? Want to spice it up with some armor plating, a few spikes or chains, or maybe even some flaming decals? Then Z to the A to the zzber (whew, that&apos;s a mouthful!) will be glad to welcome you to his shop where you can epic-ize your mount with some phat total pimpage!<br>
<br>
Coming in a future content patch, we plan to bring you a new feature that will allow you to alter the color, the armor, or add decorations to your in-game mounts. Simply drop in to Zazzber&apos;s Local Fix-&apos;Er-Up, pay a small fee, and leave your mount there overnight. The next morning, you&apos;ll pick up a mount that is uniquely yours! <br>
<br>
The Epic Pimpage<br>
The process of pimping your tired old mount is quite simple. Drop by Zazzber&apos;s local Fix-&apos;Er-Up (available in Orgrimmar, Ironforge, and Dalaran with a very special PvP-oriented shop over in the phrigid lands of Wintergrasp) and talk to our resident mount pimp, Zazzber or his high-tech redneck assistant Janie Sue and, for a small fee, they&apos;ll overhaul your hauler, tricking your tired old vehicle out into something worthy of the Achievement &quot;Pimp My Mount.&quot; <br>

[color=#0099FF]It used to be that whenever I rode my horse past the Exodar, the other draenei laughed at me. &quot;Silly girl,&quot; they&apos;d say, &quot;get yourself a proper elekk!&quot; But now, thanks to Z-dawg&apos;s ultimate pimpage, those other goat-heads all wish their mounts were half as fly as this guy![center]http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/pmm3_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/pmm3.jpg)<br>
[color=#0099FF]The other trolls, mon, used to think I was strange for preferrin&apos; my kodo to a raptor. But then my main man, Z, hooked me up with some upgrades to my sleek ride. I&apos;ve got some shade even under the blazin&apos; beach sun over in Stranglethorn and my kodo? He&apos;s pimpin&apos; it out with his superfly hat!<br>

Maybe coming back from the dead changed me; I&apos;ll never know for sure. But all I know is that I&apos;ve always loved my kitty-cat. Sure, the other death knights thought it was a little silly but now I fire up my cat&apos;s phat nitro-boosters and blast those death knights on dead horses out of this life!</div></div>
