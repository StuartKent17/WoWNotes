Legion - Dalaran Portals<br>
In Legion, Dalaran has a large assortment of portals. The old portals from Wrath of the Lich King are back, along with some new ones! <br>
<br>
Horde have portals to Orgrimmar, Undercity, Thunder Bluff, Silvermoon, and Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Alliance have portals to Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, Exodar, and Vale of the Eternal Blossoms. <br>
<br>
Both factions have access to portals in the new structure in the center of Dalaran. These are currently used for Artifact intro quest teleports, leading to Caverns of Time, Shattrath, Wyrmrest Temple, Dalaran Crater, and Karazhan. <br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
In your opinion, is a huge beta like the one in MoP better than the a relatively smaller one like in Cata?(number of testers)<br>
Depends on the goal: quality of feedback? Relationship with the testers? Stress testing? Build I got media hype? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/688090090032136192))<br>
