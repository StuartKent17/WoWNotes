Getting a Boost to Level 100
With the advent of Legion, players who purchase the expansion are able to boost one character instantly to level 100. To help enhance the experience, we’ve introduced a new way to become familiar with your newly boosted character.

Players who boost a character to level 100 will now be placed into a brief tutorial experience which will help teach some of the core abilities of the class. This experience will start with a pre-selected specialization which can be easily changed at the completion of the tutorial.

Gunships of the Broken Shore
Whether you’re Horde or Alliance, you’ll begin your new adventure on a gunship that’s patrolling the Broken Shore. Your new trainer will guide you along the way as you become familiar with your new class providing you with opportunities to practice against several enemies.

Tip for Veterans: If you’re sure of your abilities with your newly boosted class, you can skip the experience Are you sure? by simply getting a flight from a Gryphon on the gunship. Really sure? This will move you on to the next part of your adventure.

Once you’ve completed the brief experience on the gunship, it’s time to move on to the Broken Shore to truly begin testing your mettle against the Burning Legion.

*Additional character boosts can also be purchased within the Shop.

Legion Collector's Edition
I felt this is very unfair as the hard copy of the collector's edition would be more expensive and require much earlier reservation compare to the digital copy.

I hope this issue can be address since it is a big set back for all of the dedicated player who waits for the hard copy. I don't mind paying full upfront as well, as long as we can get the same perk as other people.
Understandable, Tumontis, unfortunately those pre-orders could not be set up to allow it to be tied to your Battle.net account until you actually receive the copy of the game. As others mentioned you can purchase the digital version now and get a replacement key when you add your Collector's Edition. Obviously that is not an ideal solution but it is the one that we currently have available. 

Any feedback you may have on Legion pre-order/pre-purchase options and the early access to Demon Hunters should be posted in the General Discussion forum or through the in-game interface option. I'm afraid CS has no involvement there but I can assure you that our Developers are very much aware of the limitations to this and hope to have better solutions going forward. Official Forums

Outlaw Rogue -- Legion Beta Feedback
In addition to the Roll the Bones changes, the damage of Run Through and Between the Eyes was increased these will all be in upcoming hotfix notes.

We've been monitoring the issue of rerolling Roll the Bones throughout beta. While we're okay with some possibility to gain damage from rerolling as an advanced tactic, we didn't want the reroll frequency or the potential DPS benefit to be as high as it was. The main way to make rerolling less of a potential benefit is to shift damage from Roll the Bones into the other combo point spenders that it competes with. We did that in today's hotfix. In the process, we also narrowed the variance between the six Roll the Bones buffs.

Our expectation is that simulations or other idealized steady-DPS scenarios may still show a small gain from rerolling in some cases, but that in practical scenarios for the majority of players, it will not be an expected or required part of gameplay. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
