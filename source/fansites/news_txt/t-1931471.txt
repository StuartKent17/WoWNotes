Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Obvious MMO question,What are your views on RNG systems used as stat progression?Leveling up was progression before loot tabl
There can be an entitlement risk without RNG - it says if you invest enough time, you will be able to get the reward you want. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/684049159666536448

A small build went out to the PTR today, but it didn't make any significant changes, just client fixes.
