<br>
25 years ago, a small group of gamers set out to create the kinds of game experiences they loved playing&#x2014;and Blizzard Entertainment was born. Since then, the team at Blizzard has transported millions of people around the world to fantastic worlds of fantasy and science fiction&#x2014;including Diablo&#x2019;s Sanctuary, which first invited players to descend into the terrifying labyrinth beneath the Tristram Cathedral 20 years ago in 1996!<br>
<br>
Please join us in celebrating these anniversaries on Friday, November 4 from 8 p.m. until 10 p.m. in the Grand Plaza outside the Anaheim Convention Center during BlizzCon 2016. This event is open to everyone, whether you&#x2019;re attending the convention or just happen to be in the neighborhood, and admission is free. We&#x2019;ll also have some great food, special anniversary-themed drinks, entertainment&#x2014;and even a surprise or two.<br>
