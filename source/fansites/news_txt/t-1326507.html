Item Level Squish Feedback<br>
Demonstrating why we warn you about taking translated interviews as fact, Ghostcrawler mentioned today that he did not confirm an upcoming item squish, along with answering a few common concerns. You can take part in the ongoing discussion here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1326163-Item-Squish-Confirmed).<br>
mmo-champion says item squish soon confirmed. Please do not regress my character. I worked hard to get him to where he is.<br>
I didn&apos;t confirm it. Still we think there are a lot of good reasons to get numbers down to more parsable levels. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362307978944200705))<br>
100m, 100k, and 100 are all equally &apos;parsable&apos;. It&apos;s all about formatting.<br>
We describe automobile speed in miles / kilometers per hour and not inches / cms, because big numbers are awkard. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362360714142302211))<br>
Exactly. We use KILOmeters per hour. What&apos;s the problem with using KILOdamage per second?<br>
That&apos;s the mega damage solution, and we&apos;re just worried it will look a little silly. You crit for 200 MEGADAMAGE! (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362454654493270016))<br>
<br>
I now have to find 24 other people to do BT/DS/BWL/ICC and follow mechanics just for pets and mog gear? no ty!<br>
I have said several times that item squish would not affect the ability to solo old content. That&apos;s not the intent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362451031138893824))<br>
<br>
But can you nerf every player without in anyway effecting soloing low level content? Keep everything the same but the numbers?<br>
&quot;If player enters old instance, then buff all their stats.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362453330179534850))<br>

Patch 5.4 - Change to RPPM Mechanics<br>
We think the cooldown lineup at the start of PvE encounters has gotten out of hand, and it&#x2019;s having some rather negative effects on gameplay. Particularly with the number of RPPM procs most raiders have these days, the pull has just become way too important. It&#x2019;s affecting gearing, it&#x2019;s punishing classes that can&#x2019;t capitalize on it as well as others, and it&#x2019;s not how we&#x2019;d like raiding to work.<br>
<br>
To that end, we&#x2019;re going to make another change to how RPPM mechanics work on the pull. Starting a raid encounter will set every RPPM proc&#x2019;s &#x201C;time since last proc&#x201D; to 90 seconds. That means the more frequent procs will still be more or less guaranteed to go off, but the rarer (and more powerful) procs will just have a high chance. This should hopefully chill things out a little bit, without changing how you play too dramatically.<br>
<br>
Can we clarify what &apos;rarer&apos; RPPM procs are? We talking the meta-gem here? <br>
We&apos;re not changing the actual RPPM proc rates at all, just how much time is &quot;banked&quot; before the pull. The underlying math that determines what the actual chances are isn&apos;t changing.<br>
<br>
So, here&apos;s a couple hypothetical examples using very rough napkin math. I don&apos;t remember RPPMs for actual trinkets off the top of my head (and they&apos;re not particularly necessary for illustration purposes):<br>
<br>
Trinket A has an RPPM that allows it to reach a 100% proc chance if it hasn&apos;t fired after 60 seconds. This trinket will have a guaranteed proc on the pull.<br>
<br>
Trinket B has an RPPM that allows it to reach a 100% proc chance if it hasn&apos;t fired after 100 seconds. It will not be guaranteed to proc immediately, but will proc within the first 10 seconds.<br>
<br>
Trinket C has an RPPM that allows it to reach a 100% proc chance after 2 minutes. It will not be guaranteed to proc immediately (regardless of how much time you&apos;ve spent out of combat), but will proc within the first 30 seconds.<br>
<br>
Make sense?<br>
<br>
My 502 UVLS doesn&apos;t have a guaranteed proc chance 2 minutes in though. Lore&apos;s example needs a trinket D, which is only guaranteed in excess of 6 minutes of no procs. <br>
This is true -- some trinkets will now be unlikely to proc immediately (which is the point of the change). However, it should be noted that it&apos;s extremely unlikely for any RPPM proc to take until it hits a 100% chance to activate anyway.<br>
<br>
Guilds are still going to wait. This change is good, but it&apos;s not good enough. <br>
Aside from the fact that most groups wouldn&apos;t be ready for another pull within 90 seconds anyway, waiting has no effect whatsoever. As soon as a raid encounter is pulled, the time since last proc for all RPPM mechanics in the raid will be set to exactly 90 seconds. Doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s been 10 seconds or 10 minutes since the last pull.<br>
<br>
I do want to say, this is distinctly a nerf to fun. It WAS A LOT of fun to open up full force pot, cloak, enchant, 2xtrinkets, meta, stormlash, + elemental + lava burst. I was hitting 75,000 spellpower <br>
I feel like the &quot;nerf to fun&quot; argument gets overstated quite a bit. We&apos;re not nerfing it because it was fun, we&apos;re nerfing it because it was breaking the game.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m sure a lot of players would find it fun to be able to take down Heroic Lei Shen with a single spell. That doesn&apos;t make it good gameplay.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m skeptical to the idea that not getting a proc in the initial burst will somehow make these trinkets not worth using. After that first proc on the pull, the time since last proc is 0 anyway. It&apos;ll tone back the initial burst, definitely, but I&apos;m not convinced that the entire value of a trinket like Unerring Vision of Lei Shen depends on that first proc.<br>
<br>

Patch 5.4 Arena Changes<br>
Yeah, i miss the teamnames but the patch is still going to be really good. <br>
We understand that there are some players that will miss the customization and comradeship that came with arena teams. We&apos;re looking into ways in which we will be able to retain these particular feelings in arena after these changes occur, but at this time we don&apos;t have anything to share in this regard. <br>
<br>
I wonder how the ladders will look now. Players with highest ratings etc? I hope they thought this through thoroughly. <br>
The ladders will show individual players and their rankings will be based off of their personal rating. End of season rewards will still be awarded in the same manner as they are now, to the top &quot;X&quot;% of competitors, the percentage of course being different depending on the reward.<br>
<br>
So it&apos;s all 100% individual? If I play with a team to 2600 and one of my teammates ends on 2560 and cutoff is 2570 he wont get a reward? <br>
Well, while you may play with a few specific players and you consider yourselves a team, you&apos;re not actually in a set team. But this is also the case as if he also got the title just for playing with you, because there are no teams in 5.4 you could also feed the title to anyone that you wanted who was just under the cutoff.<br>
<br>
Don&apos;t encourage wintrading... <br>
I feel that I need to clarify on my last post as there was some misunderstanding of what I meant. I was not promoting win trading, nor was I saying that you will be able to feed your end of season rewards to others. I wanted to point out that if the system worked as Easydragon questioned, then you could feed your rewards to others if they were just under the cut-off because there are no set teams. Don&apos;t worry as you won&apos;t be able to feed the title to others by playing with them, the rewards are based off of your own personal ratings alone. <br>
<br>
I apologize for any confusion my post may have caused, I have now rephrased it to clarify the above points. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265335-pvp-revived-in-54/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7860656533?page=2#30))<br>
<br>
Utility and Hunters<br>
So, this isn&apos;t solely specific to Hunters, but since it&apos;s an issue I see you guys bring up a lot, I want to talk briefly about &quot;utility.&quot;<br>
<br>
From a top-down perspective, our design philosophy regarding utility goes something like this: everyone brings some sort of benefit to the group, but no one gets an invite based solely on that benefit. We feel that current class mechanics satisfy the first part of that. We&apos;re mostly there with the second half, with some exceptions.<br>
<br>
Sometimes we just make something too strong to the point that it feels mandatory. That&apos;s absolutely true. A current example would be Demonic Gateway, particularly in PvE. It gives a very large benefit in many encounters, and since more Gateways are nearly always a good thing, many raid teams will seek to bring as many Warlocks as they can (though obviously, Warlock DPS has been a factor as well). In that particular case, we&apos;re making some changes in 5.4 and, if necessary, may continue to make changes.<br>
<br>
The reason I bring that up is that it has the tendency to cast a harsher light than is probably fair on other classes. We feel that, ignoring the extreme outliers like Demonic Gateway, Hunters bring an acceptable amount of utility. Every Hunter has Trueshot Aura and access to an array of buffs and debuffs through their pets (even if not specced Beast Mastery), and abilities like Misdirection and Ice Trap which can be valuable on some encounters. If that&apos;s not enough utility to guarantee you a raid invite... then good. We&apos;d rather you get your invite by being a solid raider with good performance.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m also slightly confused as to the logic behind some arguments, specifically those along the lines of &quot;our DPS is low, so we need more utility to justify our raid slot.&quot; If that&apos;s the case, wouldn&apos;t you prefer we fix your damage output and/or tone down the overperformers?<br>
<br>
I know this doesn&apos;t address every concern that&apos;s been brought up, and I apologize for that. If and when we have more to share, we will. But I did want to at least shed some light on our thoughts on the &quot;utility&quot; issue overall, for the sake of discussion.<br>
<br>
Oh, one thing I can share: we like the idea of removing the focus cost from Dash, so we&apos;re going to. That includes Dive and Charge as well.<br>
<br>
As has been mentioned in other &quot;utility&quot; threads, part of the problem here is that nobody agrees on what &quot;utility&quot; is. Is the dev definition of the word something you can shed a little light on? (I realize that may raise the &quot;it&apos;s a trap!&quot; alarm, so feel free to ignore if you think that would do more harm than good.)<br>
<br>
My own working definition for a few years now has been: anything that is beneficial to the group, while in combat, that doesn&apos;t pertain directly to my personal performance in my role. Which basically, for a DPS class, would mean anything that doesn&apos;t cause me and only me to deal additional damage, and isn&apos;t an out-of-combat thing like summoning.<br>
This is probably pretty close to our definition. As you mention, it&apos;s the sort of thing that I&apos;d be hesitant to try to define precisely (it&apos;s something of a fluid term even internally).<br>
<br>
Do you think it&apos;s fair that certain abilities (namely Ancient Hysteria and battle rez) are locked to Beast Mastery only? If it&apos;s a 25 man situation, probably, but in 10 man you do run the issue of not having either of these. Sometimes that could lead to Hunter&apos;s feeling as though they must have Beast Mastery as a spec.<br>
It&apos;s something I can bring up again, but we do like these as Beast Mastery perks. Note that, at least in the case of Ancient Hysteria, 5.4 is adding Drums of Rage (a consumable form of Bloodlust/Heroism made by Leatherworkers) that, while not quite as effective as the Beast Mastery buff, should make things at least a little more flexible for 10-mans.

RPPM scaling with Runespeed Mechanics<br>
As an update to this, since we&apos;ve seen some confusion, Improved Unholy Presence is getting the same treatment as Unholy Presence, meaning it will now grant additional haste, not just additional attack speed and rune regen. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265263-rppm-scaling-with-runespeed-mechanics/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9561126353?page=4#74))<br>

<br>
PTR Testing and You<br>
From Zul&#x2019;Gurub and Ahn&#x2019;Qiraj onward, we have made extensive use of our Public Test Realms in order to help find bugs and improve the tuning of our raid content. We have an extensive team of Quality Assurance testers and an internal raid group, but it&#x2019;s impossible to replicate the sheer breadth of information we get from having hundreds of real raid groups attempting diverse strategies as they experience encounters for the first time. We learn a tremendous amount from that testing, both in the form of written feedback on these forums, which is carefully read by every encounter designer, and from spectating raids and observing how they fare. <br>
<br>
Now, that&#x2019;s what we get out of the PTR. Speaking pragmatically, we understand that not everyone&apos;s motivation in logging on to the PTR is to give us feedback. They want to check out the new content firsthand, see what&#x2019;s coming to the live servers in a few weeks or months, and, in the case of raiding, get some competitive edge that will help them clear the content faster on the live servers when the patch is released. That&#x2019;s fine. We thoroughly appreciate everyone who takes the time to give measured feedback, or goes out of their way to methodically test new features and report bugs they find. But at the end of the day, we&#x2019;d rather have a packed PTR with a small percentage giving direct feedback, than a nearly-empty PTR where everyone gives it. Bugs that require very specific conditions are much more likely to occur with thousands of testers than with hundreds, and it&#x2019;s clearly beneficial to everyone for us to find and fix those issues before they affect millions in a live environment.<br>
<br>
When it comes to raid testing in particular, there&#x2019;s a symbiotic relationship: The bleeding-edge guild that intentionally wipes to a boss at 5% so they can set up their boss addons, try out unusual strategies, and practice execution is there for competitive reasons. But we gain information even just from silently observing that will help us make our encounters better, and fundamentally, that is the purpose of raid testing on PTR. Our raid testing times are scheduled to coincide with our core work hours, so that designers can observe as much of the testing as possible, with the exception of LFR and Flexible tests which require more open-ended scheduling given their nature and target audience (and even then, if you were doing a PTR Flexible raid this past weekend, odds are decent that I or another developer was spying on your group &#x2013; creepy, I know). When it comes to Heroic testing, we try to keep the testing windows as brief as possible, in order to minimize the impact of PTR testing on the progression &#x201C;race.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
But that symbiotic relationship requires that we be around in some capacity to observe. Players who find a way to access bosses (especially Heroic bosses) that aren&#x2019;t currently being tested should let us know, so we can correct the problem. We discovered that over the weekend a progression raid group accessed the Siege of Orgrimmar raid and spent hours on a Heroic boss in the middle of the night, after copying fresh characters with generic names, presumably with the hope of going unnoticed. Those actions go against the intent of the PTR, the spirit of fair play, and were clearly intended to go against our wishes for specific boss testing periods. PTR testing is a privilege, and we reserve the right to revoke PTR access from those who have shown an intent to abuse it.<br>
<br>
If you come across an oversight in our testing protocols, or a serious, abusable bug or exploit in the course of your testing of a boss encounter on PTR, and you want to let us know without alerting everyone, please note that we can read edited or deleted forum posts. (On the live servers, please use the in-game bug reporting interface.) Otherwise, carry on with the fantastic feedback that we&#x2019;ve been receiving about all facets of 5.4 content thus far, and we look forward to seeing you on the Public Test Realm!<br>
