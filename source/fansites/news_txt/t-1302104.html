Card Database<br>
Take a look at all of the previously unseen cards in the Card Database (http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards)!<br>

Every Card - Every Hearthstone card found in the game as of the current build is listed, except for the placeholder cards that we have hidden and two that will be revealed by Blizzard next week. <br>
Many Views - There are three different ways to browse cards:<br>
<br>
Visual (http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards) - View both the picture and all the card information in text form. Gives all the information you could need about the card (including if it can be gold).<br>
Images (http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards?display=3) - View every card in picture form (Great for looking at all the art)<br>
Listing (http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards?display=1) - Simply lists the name, and basic stats. Great for quick browsing.<br>
<br>
Filters - We have a filter for every class, type, and attribute there is. We also list the set names and more that you will only find on HearthPwn.<br>
Artist Names - The database also has the name of the artist for each and every card.<br>
Card Flavor Text - Many cards (http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/303-alexstrasza) have flavor text, such as &quot;Alexstrasza was enslaved by the orc Nekros Skullcrusher just before the Second War. When she was freed, she swallowed him whole. Yum!&quot;<br>
See Decks That Include Your Favorite Cards - Every card page has both a graph showing how many decks hold that card, along with links to every deck that has that card in it. Find a new fun card, and instantly find decks based off it!<br>
