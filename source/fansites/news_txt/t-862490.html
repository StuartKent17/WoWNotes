What I&apos;ve been suspecting for a while is now confirmed, Firelands will not be included in patch 4.1. This is why you aren&apos;t seeing anything about it in the patch notes or on the test realms.<br>
<br>
For more details on the decision, read the Full Article on Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-03-04-firelands-raid-will-not-be-in-wow-patch-4-1)<br>

From Eurogamer (http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-03-04-firelands-raid-will-not-be-in-wow-patch-4-1)<br>
Blizzard has told Eurogamer that the Firelands raid &#x2013; the next tier of endgame raiding progression for the MMO &#x2013; will not appear in the next patch, 4.1, as it had previously planned. <br>
<br>
In an interview at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, lead producer J. Allen Brack said that players were not sufficiently advanced through the raid content that shipped with third expansion Cataclysm in December to handle the challenge of Firelands. He also suggested that Blizzard was thinking of creating &quot;smaller&quot; content patches for World of Warcraft. <br>
<br>
&quot;We feel like the player base isn&apos;t really ready for the next raid yet,&quot; he said. &quot;And that led to some changes where Firelands is now actually going to be in 4.2.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Our plan is to package... features into smaller content updates and to release them as soon as possible, rather than wait and release larger updates more infrequently,&quot; Blizzard added in a statement. <br>
<br>
[...]After the interview, Blizzard gave Eurogamer the following statement about the decision to remove Firelands from patch 4.1. <br>
The decision to move Firelands to 4.2 was also motivated by a desire to move away from the &quot;monolithic&quot; content patches World of Warcraft has received recently, towards smaller updates, Brack said. <br>
<br>
&quot;Patch 4.1 provides our players with access to the completely redesigned Zul&apos;Aman and Zul&apos;Gurub five-player dungeons, where they&apos;ll be able to experience challenging encounters featuring all-new boss mechanics, obtain updated epic-level loot, and possibly acquire rare mounts.<br>
<br>
&quot;One of our long-standing development goals is to release regular content updates for the community to enjoy. These updates are generally focused on introducing specific content, like a new raid or new gameplay features.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our plan is to package these features into smaller content updates and to release them as soon as possible, rather than wait and release larger updates more infrequently.<br>
<br>
&quot;The previously announced Firelands raid will be part of content update 4.2 which should come soon after 4.1.<br>

Feral Swiftness (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/24866/feral-swiftness/) now also causes Dash (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/1850/dash/) and Stampeding Roar (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77764/stampeding-roar/) to have a 50/100% chance to instantly remove all movement impairing effects from the affected targets when used.<br>

Restoration<br>
<br>
Efflorescence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/81275/efflorescence/) has been redesigned. It creates a healing zone at the feet of a Swiftmend (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/18562/swiftmend/) target, but this healing zone now restores health equal to 4/8/12% of the amount healed by Swiftmend to the three most injured targets within 8 yards, every 1 second for 7 seconds. This periodic effect now also benefits from spell haste, but the individual ticks cannot be critical effects.<br>

Restoration<br>
<br>
Deep Healing now benefits all heals, not just direct heals.<br>
Spirit Link Totem (new talent) reduces damage taken by all party and raid members within 10 yards by 10%. This lasts 6 seconds, and every second it is active the health of all affected players is redistributed among them, such that each player ends up with the same percentage of their maximum health. This counts as an Air totem and has a 3-minute cooldown.<br>
