Every week, for five weeks, the 100 most impressive screenshots will earn you and your guild 10 keycodes to access the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm (http://www.wow-europe.com/cataclysm/) Beta!<br>
<br>
What are you waiting for? All you need to do is take a screenshot of you and your guild showing off your creativity in terms of breath-taking landscapes, lighting, impressive camera angles and epic poses. The only requirement is that the word &#x201C;Cataclysm!&#x201D; is displayed in a chat bubble together with your character and guild names! Please remember that submissions missing the chat bubble and guild name tags will be ineligible to win.<br>

<br>
Use the environment to your advantage! Points of interest, dungeons, even bosses are there to help you.<br>
Pimp your screenshot by setting the in-game graphics settings to the max! There is no need to worry about your frame rate since the submission is a still image.<br>
We strongly encourage you to disable your addons while taking the screenshot. Keep the default interface on and capture your picture of awesomeness!<br>

Cloth Itemization in Cataclysm<br>
Yes. If it has +hit on it, it might be attractive to a mage, lock or Shadow priest. If it has +Spirit on it, it will be more attractive to healing priests. If it has neither stat on it, then it might be attractive to any cloth wearer. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626573044/strength-1-handed-weapons-in-4-0/))<br>

Spirit in Cataclysm<br>
You&apos;ll need enough Spirit to have good regen. That probably doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re going to pass on every item without Spirit.<br>
<br>
Spirit is a weird stat that is technically primary but has more in common with stats like crit and haste. What I mean is that if you found an item without Intellect, you&apos;d almost certainly pass on it because that likely means the item has Agi or Strength instead. But if you find an item with Int but no Spirit, it might be a good upgrade. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626573044/strength-1-handed-weapons-in-4-0/))</div></div>
