7.3 PTR Build Deploy - 8/8/2017<br>
Greetings friends!<br>
<br>
We&apos;ll be pushing a new 7.3.0 build to PTR this morning and will need to bring realms down to do so. No ETA for today&apos;s push but I&apos;ll ping this thread if things look like they&apos;re going to take longer than usual (~4-6 hours). <br>
<br>
As always this thread will remain open for discussion, so long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines. <br>
<br>
Thanks for your patience everyone!<br>
<br>
<br>
Patch 7.3 - Netherlight Crucible Requirements<br>
One quick update for now, based on some discussions that came up after this was posted on Friday:<br>
<br>
Q: What are the requirements to access the Netherlight Crucible?<br>
A: Our intent at this stage of development is for there to only be two requirements: your character is level 110, and you have the account-wide achievement &quot;Now You&apos;re Cooking With Netherlight.&quot; That achievement is given as part of the final chapters of the 7.3 story campaign, which is planned to open week 3 of the patch (so 15 days after release).<br>
<br>
We&apos;ve been able to isolate a couple of bugs - partly due to responses to this thread, so thank you! - that are currently on the PTR preventing access to the Netherlight Crucible unless you have a rank in Concordance of the Legionfall. That&apos;s an unintended restriction, which we&apos;re working on fixing for a future PTR update.<br>
<br>
<br>
Weekly Bonus Event - Battlegrounds<br>
A new weekly quest and rewards are here&#x2014;steel yourself for Battleground combat!<br>

Seven Days on the Battlegrounds<br>
All this week, heading to the Battlegrounds will net you some extra Honor along with bonus loot for completing this week&#x2019;s quest. To enter the fray, open Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select the Player vs. Player tab. Next choose Casual, select Random Battlegrounds, and hit the Join Battle button&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll be matched up with other players and sent to one of the 11 battlegrounds.<br>
<br>
Weekly Quest<br>
Before you get started, Archmage Timear (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest for you (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44173-a-call-to-battle). Win four random Battlegrounds, and you&#x2019;ll be rewarded with 5 Marks of Honor, a Badge of Honor (1000 Honor), and a Glory of the Melee Artifact Power token (base 500 AP).<br>

<br>
A New Event Every Week<br>
The Bonus Events system consists of a rotating schedule of different activities, currently scheduled to run each week beginning on Tuesdays. Each Bonus Event grants a passive bonus to a particular game activity and offers a once-per-event quest with a noteworthy reward for accomplishing a related goal. The in-game calendar can serve as your one-stop reference for the event schedule. The Adventure Guide also offers a direct link to active Bonus Events, allowing you to easily accept any associated quests.<br>

<br>
Gravity getting you down? Step into the Eye of the Storm and be prepared for a whole new en-lighten-ing experience. Every minute, players on the battlefield will find themselves launched into the air, only to gently fall toward the ground again in a perpetual aerial ballet as they try to accrue enough resources to take the win home for their team.</div></div>
