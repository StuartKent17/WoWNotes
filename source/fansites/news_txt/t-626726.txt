Merrymaker http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2144 is part of What A Long, Strange Trip It's Been http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2144 to get the Violet Proto-Drake http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/september/8970/mount_violetprotodrake.jpg. I assume that most of you will try to complete it, here is a small guide to help you becoming a Merrymaker! 

On Metzen! http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=273
Complete http://static.wowhead.com/images/horde-icon.gifMetzen the Reindeer http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=8746 / http://static.wowhead.com/images/alliance-icon.gifMetzen the Reindeer http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=8762, Metzen is still in the Searing Gorge and in Tanaris, just like all the other years. You can check the map on wowhead http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=15664. The quests for this achievement start in Orgrimmar / Ironforge depending on your faction. Like pretty much all the quests for the event 

Scrooge http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=259 / Scrooge http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1255
Another "free" achievement, just buy a Snowball http://www.wowhead.com/?item=17202 and throw it at King Magni Bronzebeard http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=2784 in Ironforge or Cairne Bloodhoof http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=3057 in Thunder Bluff depending on your faction.

'Tis the Season http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=277 
To complete this achievement you will need a full set of Winter clothing. 
Red Clothes http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34085 / Green Clothes http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34087 are crafted by tailors. 
Winter Boots http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34086 are crafted by leatherworkers.
Red Winter Hat http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21524 and Green Winter Hat http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21525 are slightly more difficult to obtain. You will need to drop them from various bosses in instance. 

Just like last year, the drop locations for these hats have been updated for level 80 players to prevent them from being soloable but the red hat probably is for the stronger classes, the easiest way to complete the achievement is obviously to rush the nexus with a friend. The known drop locations in Wrath of the Lich King are as follow: 
Red Winter Hat http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21524 - Grand Magus Telestra http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=26731 The Nexus, Jedoga Shadowseeker http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=29310 Ahn'kahet, 
Green Winter Hat http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21525 - Mage-Lord Urom http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=27655 The Oculus
Feel free to contribute with the missing drop locations in comments.

The last part of the achievement is the Graccu's Mince Meat Fruitcake http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21215 is contained in Smokywood Pastures Extra-Special Gift http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21216 and Smokywood Pastures Sampler http://www.wowhead.com/?item=17685, they will be mailed to you after freeing Metzen see the first achievement or completing Treats for Greatfather Winter http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7025.

Simply Abominable http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=279
Complete the http://static.wowhead.com/images/horde-icon.gifStolen Winter Veil Treats http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7042 / http://static.wowhead.com/images/alliance-icon.gifStolen Winter Veil Treats http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=6963 questline. They require you to talk to the Strange Snowman http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=13636 in Alterac Mountains to get a quest http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7043 to kill The Abominable Greench http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=13602

Bros. Before Ho Ho Ho's http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1686
When you're done laughing at the name of the achievement, you can check the small guides in Wowhead comments for both faction:
Horde http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1685#comments:id=439083
Alliance http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1686#comments:id=415758
Alliance players have to talk to a lot more people, but Horde players have to go through Northrend and eventually end up in Icecrown, it might be a problem for players below level 77. The hardest part of the achievement might be getting the Mistletoe http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21519, to obtain it just type /kiss while targeting a Winter Reveler http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=15760. This is a random "drop", you might have to try it a few times to actually get the Mistletoe

He Knows If You've Been Naughty http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1689
Open one of the presents underneath the Winter Veil tree once they are available. You only need to open ONE present and not all of them, it's basically another free achievement. The presents are only available from December 25th to January 2nd and you'll have to wait a few days before you can complete this one.

With a Little Helper from My Friends http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=252
Earn 50 honorable kills as a Little Helper from the Winter Wondervolt machine. The machines are outside Orgrimmar / Ironforge, just step into it to get a 30 minutes transformation buff and enter your favorite battleground to kill a few people! Note that the transformation does NOT persist through death, you will have to finish/leave the battleground and get another transformation if you die

Fa-la-la-la-Ogri'la http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1282
Complete Bomb Them Again! http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=11023 after transforming your mount with Preserved Holly http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21213 / Fresh Holly http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21212 rewarded from various quests and Winter Revelers during the event.

Crashin' & Thrashin' http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1295
This achievement requires to use the special ability of your Crashin' Thrashin' Racer Controller http://www.wowhead.com/?item=37710 and smash other player's racer Video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF4zHsCtVlY. This item is available from the presents under the christmas tree and won't be available before December 25th. Except if you still have unopened presents from last year

Let It Snow http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1687
During the Feast of Winter Veil, use a Handful of Snowflakes on each of the race/class combinations listed below. This achievement could be hard because the only way to get Handful of Snowflakes http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34191 is by kissing Winter Revelers once an hour. Hopefully, they're not soulbound and can be sold / exchanged between your characters, depending on how desperate you are you could just create level 1 characters to get enough of them. You could also do that to sell tons of them at the AH ... but you can't sell conjured items.

The Winter Veil Gourmet http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1688
Depending on your character, this might be the hardest achievement. It requires you to cook Gingerbread Cookie http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=21143 Egg Nog http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=21144 and Hot Apple Cider http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=45022. The patterns are all available from the NPC, there are only two small problems:

You will need Small Egg http://www.wowhead.com/?item=6889 for two of these recipes, and will probably have to run to a low level zone to farm them along with 30 other players. Buying them at 50G/stack at the AH is also an option
Hot Apple Cider http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=45022 require 325 cooking skill! If you never took the time to level your cooking, you will have to go through all the leveling just to complete this achievement.

Needless to say that the price of cooking reagents will most likely skyrocket.

A Frosty Shake http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1690
During the Feast of Winter Veil, use your Winter Veil Disguise kit http://www.wowhead.com/?item=17712 to become a snowman and then dance with another snowman in Dalaran. The Winter Veil Disguise kit http://www.wowhead.com/?item=17712 is one of the reward mailed to you after completing Stolen Winter Veil Treats http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=6963.
