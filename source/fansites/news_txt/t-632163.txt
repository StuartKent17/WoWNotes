Boubouille2009-01-27, 09:45 AMTier 8 Armor Preview ... Again!
Patch 3.0.8 is behind us and the next one deployed on PTRs should be the content patch introducing Ulduar and Tier 8 sets along with a few other things. I already posted these sets a few weeks ago but a lot of people requested screenshots of multiple races, I'm also posting new screenshots because a video will probably be posted very shortly. Yeah, seriously, the rogue set actually looks really good in game 

All races are available for each class, even if they can't pick this class in game. It didn't take a lot more time to do it for all of them and I figured it could be interesting to see how it looks. 
Only Death Knight, Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Mages, and Warlock sets are available. Don't bother asking for the others they're just not in the game files.
Male version of the rogue set isn't fully implemented in the game files, undead females are missing as well.
Dwarves aren't on mage screenshots because I didn't have the time to fix a bug with them. It's not that important I guess because dwarves can't be mages.

Lunar Festival - Finding Elders require you to complete the Wrath Gate quest line
This is the most likely culprit. If you've yet to complete the Wrathgate questline all the way through Battle for the Undercity then you'll find certain portions of the old world phased, and the elders do not appear in those phases.

Complete the Wrathgate questline and all should appear correctly. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14657045704-lunar-festival.html

Bring the player, not the class
We didn't want players to feel like they had to exclude other players that they wanted to bring based on the need to min/max certain buffs per group.

Example: In the Sunwell era, in order to bring all of the +dps buffs you needed for a group of rogues, you ran out of space to bring say the Ret pally and possibly even the rogues.

If you need 5 healers for LK content, you are better off bringing a diversity of healers because you gain different kinds of buffs and utility spells and their abilities mesh together well. But if you can't do that and want to bring 3 druids and 2 paladins or 5 priests, you can still manage the content with just a couple of exceptions like Razuvious.

The tanks tank in different ways, and as you have probably noticed, they feel pretty different to heal. Tanks are necessarily more homogenized than healers though because you might only have 2-3 of them in your group. Even so, there are encounters where a druid has a tanking advantage over a Protection paladin, just like there are situations where a Holy paladin has an advantage over a shaman. But they can all still get the job done at the end of the day.

In Sunwell, you had one possible answer to "Who should bring the Curse of Elements debuff?" or "Which class should we bring for mana regen?" That is what we want to get away from. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14657055882-gc-bring-the-player-not-the-class--heal.html
