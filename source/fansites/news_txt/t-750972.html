The latest build introduced a VERY interesting feature to the game: a built-in PowerAuras (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/powerauras-classic.aspx). If you are unfamiliar with the mod, it is mostly used to watch and warn players when a spell proc is available and the game clearly reached the point where it&apos;s fairly hard (or just annoying) to play at high level without a mod like this. <br>
<br>
Blizzard eventually agreed that watching your buff bar isn&apos;t really fun and a new icone appears on your character when situational spells such as Art of War are available, see the screenshot below.<br>

Mages - Teleport/Portal Interface<br>
Mages are getting an interface upgrade similar to Shaman&apos;s totems for their portals, you can now add a generic &quot;Portal&quot; and &quot;Teleport&quot; spell to your bar and pick a portal after clicking it. <br>

Darnassus - The Howling Oak<br>
A new sub-zone was added to Darnassus in the latest beta build - The Howling Oak, the area isn&apos;t populated yet but it looks like it will be the home of the worgens in Darnassus. <br>

Reforging - Video and Screenshots<br>
For some reasons I still get a lot of questions about reforging, this new feature is fairly simple: You talk to a NPC in capital cities to swap 40% of any of the secondary stats of an item (ratings / Spirit) for another secondary stat. TotalBiscuit released a video of Reforging in the current beta build, if you want to take a look at it.<br>

Cataclysm Digital Download<br>
If StarCraft II is any indicator you&apos;ll be able to download the client beforehand, and the the installer will unlock at 10AM pacific time. So, if you want it right at midnight (or a collector&apos;s edition), your best bet is probably a pre-order and midnight release at your local brick and mortar. But, this is all assuming things which we haven&apos;t release any information about.<br>
<br>
I&apos;d wait for more info... like... a release date. ;) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560496528/word-of-caution-for-pre-ordering-cata/))<br>

Tol Barad Tunnel System<br>
Those 3 micro dungeons will be closed off during the main battle. Anyone in them will be kicked out. They are there to support daily questing in the zone between battles. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560865999/tol-barad-tunnel-system-question/))<br>

Throne of the Tides portal on beta<br>
The Throne of the Tides portal inside the instance was set to take you to Dalaran because for a while you couldn&apos;t get out of the cavern. In a future beta build, it will take you back to Vashj&apos;ir. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560836338/thone-of-tides-instance-portal-bug/))<br>

24 Hour Maintenances<br>
The 24 hour maintenances have all been related to large scale hardware upgrades. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560566644/blue-please-not-about-the-loading-freeze/))<br>

Beta Feedback<br>
This is a beta test, so generalized feedback about how and (vaguely) why healing is not fun -- when we haven&apos;t even reached the level cap in the test process -- doesn&apos;t give us actionable feedback.<br>
<br>
There are a few things to consider here:<br>
<br>
<br>
Healers don&apos;t play in beta quite like they do in Wrath of the Lich King. Yes, the system is designed to be less forgiving so that the heal you choose to cast, or how often you choose to heal your party or top off their health bars, should be a more meaningful decision.<br>
Numbers are still being balanced, bugs are still being worked out with each new build, and we&apos;re still iterating upon individual spells and abilities.<br>
The whole group could be approaching a dungeon like they do in Wrath, trying to pull as many packs of mobs as possible to charge through it. This isn&apos;t Wrath, nor are players or creatures balanced around Wrath numbers.<br>
As an expansion of my first point, you might be making bad choices.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you&apos;d like to give us constructive feedback we can take with us to the drawing board, give us scenarios. Tell us what rotations you&apos;re using, the group make-up, whether you&apos;re using CC or AoE, a play-by-play of specific pulls or boss fights, etc. We want to know what the specific cases are where you are being as conservative as possible and still finding it to be a struggle, or even just too frustrating. We can look into that type of data. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560836571/healing-is-not-fun-what-did-you-do/))<br>

New Holy Spell<br>
The new Holy level 10 spell is pretty simple, but it also has a lot of play with Chakra. I am just pointing this out, because many players never noticed the talent that made the old Holy level 10 (Desperate Prayer) into a tool that could heal others.
