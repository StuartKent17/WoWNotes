Patch 6.2 - Trait Replacement Selection
It seems that the patch changed how the items like Supreme Manual of Dance http://www.wowdb.com/items/118474-supreme-manual-of-dance work, allowing you to select the trait being replaced. The reroll items still work the same way.

Garrison Gold Nerf
There is a reduction in gold with alts, but running missions with additional characters alts will still have a benefit over just using one. Two characters will still make more gold than one character will, and three will still make more than two, etc. There's a diminishing return sure, but you're still making more.

This is where I get confused. Because the point was supposed to be to make it so that we didn't feel the need to run alts to maximize income. This system ensures we do exactly that because now my main the only one who is taking her garrison seriously is making less gold without alts.
Well, you always made less gold if you didn't do missions with alts. You make more gold doing missions with multiple characters. That is still true.

But, taking a step back, are you saying you have no ability to earn an income to cover your main character's repair costs, etc. unless you run Garrison missions on multiple alts and funnel that into your main? I'd be interested to know more about your play habits, and also what income sources you used before Garrisons existed.

Player Feedback
Then you wonder why blizzard doesn't listen to you?
Wait wait wait, I thought we caved to complaints too much!? We can't both ignore all complaints from our castle on top of Mount Wedeci'dewutsphun, AND also cave in to all complaints. Can we? 
Maybe the truth is somewhere in between, and that we value constructive feedback, and can admit mistakes, and grow from them, and that we value and enjoy the ability to create entertainment, and honestly striving to make a fun and positive gaming experience.

Any patch day is certain to have a lot of hotfixes being made based on feedback, aaaaand also probably a lot of nonconstructive posts too I guess. We can try to moderate more of those.

Druid talent "Wild Charge" no longer works onto wild mushrooms in battlegrounds. Intended?
Because you can place Wild Mushrooms in lots of weird places, this is an intended change. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/611258296658362369

Top comments on reddit about Q&A followup disagree with you on enh and elemental.Why do you feel the class doesntneed a rework?
Was just reading that thread earlier - lots of focus on totems, not many people saying Ele's rotation needs an overhaul, no? WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/611188887466029056

Character / Items
can we still get the Garrosh Heirlooms? Do we have to be on specific classes for specific ones?
No, these were limited-time rewards. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/610973480180416513

Are the current PvP sets for Conquest and Honor going to be obtainable in 6.2 like in the past?
Yes! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/610974046948327424

PvE
What would you consider a minimum ilvl for Normal HFC? Not expecting to be locked out, trying to set expectations w/ team
Target would be people who did at least some but not necessarily lots of Normal Foundry, or who have equivalent gear. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/611303082568327171

PvP
Would Ranked SoloQ in arena be reality in the future, really think i could do a lot for the PvP-Players :-
We'll discuss it but we have concerns. Specifically, toxicity and a lack of gameplay differentiation from unranked solo queue. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/611258515512930306

What is the main purpose of the MMR system for PvP that got introduced in 6.1 - I barely see any benefits from it
There was no change to MMR. The change was to a system that boosts your Current Rating CR which used to increase at a... 1 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/611290021333716992
...higher rate until it was within 200 points of your MMR. This was heavily abused by boosters. 2 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/611290103323955201

Professions
Will the chance of getting Felblight from gathering nodes be based on skill?
No, it will not. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/611289768568078336

Misc
I know it's probably early to say this, but I think a lot of people would be sad if we didn't get a new race/class next xpac
Or what about a class that IS a race??? What would that even be? Like race: Ogre, class: Ogre, spec: Ogre. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/611673164406325248
