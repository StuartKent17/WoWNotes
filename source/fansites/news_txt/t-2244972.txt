Nithogg and Fury Warrior Artifact Appearance Hotfix
The recent hotfix we've implemented is something we were planning to make in the future, but we've moved it forward into 7.2.5 as a small quality of life change. As a note with this, the current logic behind the new drops from Odyn is the same as other appearance drops from raids.

We know that this does not solve the problem of Nithogg not spawning recently, and we realize that's an outstanding issue. In an upcoming patch, we will be moving World Bosses to a set spawn rotation from the current random spawn rotation, which should help avoid this issue in the future.

Raid Finder Target Audience
I'm not trying to be patronizing or anything but it would seem to me that LFR is designed for someone like you. IE. "not a person who raids much", "playing for 7 hours weekly on average"

By your own admission you don't raid much, so why should it bother you that those that participate in LFR have gear that is LFR caliber? If you wanted to avoid the "gear treadmill", couldn't you do mythic+?
I love doing Mythic+. I've tried RF before and didn't like it as much as normal mode. It's something I DON'T want to do, which is often an arguement used against Anti-LFR people. However, with cutting edge gear, I feel pressured to do it to be relevent. If it were gear like 870 to 880 in ToS LFR, I wouldn't have this problem.[/i] I do have to agree with the post you're quoting. I don't think high-end mythic+ dungeons are designed for someone with such a limited amount of playtime, whereas Raid Finder is. 

I don't mean this to sound harsh, but you're basically refusing to participate in, what most consider, relatively easy content as a means to upgrade your gear.

Raids have always been and will continue to be the cutting-edge end-game content providing the best gear. This isn't a new concept, and Mythic+ just provides a means to achieve a similar* end at a broader scope with less commitment to raid schedules.

I don't think people are here to troll or lambaste you on purpose, you're just a part of a community where a vast majority of people do LFR, even if just for gear, but yet you say you refuse to do it. I'm not sure what you're expecting here. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
