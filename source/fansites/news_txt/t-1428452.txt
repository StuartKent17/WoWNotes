Warlords of Draenor Stats
Minor example is ratio of ambush bonus dmg to backstab bonus dmg is constant at all levels, but backstab scales better with gear
You'd find that all of the base damage on spells/abilities stays in constant ratios at all levels, for a given class, BTW. Source 
And that's the problem. For a lvl 30 with 150 SP, this increases Wrath by 138% but Healing Touch by just 28%
Heals had higher base healing to make up for players having base health. However, that didn't line up and scale perfectly. Source 
In WoD, there will be no more base health, or base damage/healing on spells, so it's all just scaling; can line up. Source 
So whats this going to do to dmg and healing at low lvls if you don't have heirlooms you won't have much stats.
There are still base stats. Source 
Is there going to be a base amount of the new secondaries? like even with 0 crit rating u still crit
No. You still crit with 0 crit rating because you have 5% base crit, and crit from agi/int. Source 
More similar to haste, where there is no base amount of haste. Source 

Does no Dodge/Parry on gear mean Strength -> Parry and Agility -> Dodge are being removed as well?
Nope, those remain. Source 

Now that we have 3 new secondary stats Amplify, etc.. How many of these stats will we see on a single piece of gear? Still 2?
Still typically 2 secondary stats on most gear. May be exceptions, as always, but vast majority of the time, 2. Source 

Will melee abilities still be affected by Weapon damage. Or are those abilities now only scaled by AP?
Yes, weapon damage will still be a thing. Source 

If this means all dmg spells and heals will scale with primary stat, this is a good thing although simplifies gear
Typically Attack Power or Spell Power, which mostly come from your primary stat. Source 

would be nice for weapons to means as much to casters a physical.
Somewhat ironically, weapons are actually *more* important for some casters, than some melees. SP bonus is huge. Source 

sorry if this is a repeat question but if I gem say spirit then trade to dps or tank does that gem change too eg haste for dps ?
No, only primaries on armor slots switch. Source 
sorry im more asking for the gem side the fact that say pally chest has a gem socket do I have to swap it everytime swap spec ?
Sorry, not sure I understand the question. If you put a Spirit gem in a socket, it provides no value if you respec to Feral. Source 
ok thank you that means if I have a gem socket armor piece when swap to my off spec I either need new gear or a different gem
To min-max, yes. However, remember that a different item of the same ilvl likely won't have the gem socket; sockets are free. Source 

Will Cleave on gear mean CC'd mobs have to be moved to Uzbekistan to avoid sheep-busting?
No. Cleave won't hit CC'd or mobs, or mobs you aren't in combat with. Source 

Does it mean won't be useful or won't be optimal? Is this applying to PVP too? 
Spirit will have zero value for non-healers, including in PvP. Source 

In WoD, does the baseline yellow attack hit cap include attacks against targets that are higher than 3 levels above you?
Yes. Source 
Does that also mean a lvl 1 character will have 100% hit chance against a level 100 character or mobs? aoe questing inc
No. Just up to +3 levels, then you start missing again. Similar to how Crushing Blows still exist now. Source 

PvP
I've had a question about PvP. Why is there a gear req? Why isn't it stats-agnostic, to make the game 100% skill-dependent? Thanks!
WoW is a character driven game where you participate in different activities for rewards. PvP is one of those activities. Source 
I know that very well I would just love an option at some point in time for pure stat-agnostic, skill-based pvp.
 Source 

Also, kudos for taking out expertise and hit. Step in the right direction! Still, I wish all radials were disabled in PvP though!
While there may be a place for a game with WoW gameplay and no stats/gear, WoW is not that game. WoW is an RPG. Source 
Why not poll the PvP population and see what theyâ€™d think of a permanent Trial-of-the-Champions play style?
Polling the population is not how we design games. Personally, I'd find it pretty unrewarding. I like getting gear. Source 

Crafted pvp gear feels a bit gated. Not many want to use daily cd on making 476/458 gear. Maybe lower mats over time?
We don't like the starter gear coming from crafting. Exploring the idea of BoE starter gear coming from battleground wins. Source 
OMFG BoE PvP starter gear?! If it's BoA I will make you another million cookies BoE is still awesome though!
I can see your point but I think BoA might be worse in this case. Source 

What other steps would be in there to keep those first few BG experiences from being even more brutal to new folk?
I think a lot of the UI changes we're making are in support that goal Source 

Misc
And you are the next Ghostcrawler ?
Nah, I just work on flavor/feels things like Headless Horsemen & Darkmoon Faires & zombie plagues & pets & toys & so on. Source 
You're my friggin hero for trolling people about Kara so damn hard.
Just wait until Heroic Zul'Farrak gets data mined. Source
