Chaos Orbs in patch 4.3
We have just made the following change in the PTR:

In 4.3, Chaos Orbs http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52078/chaos-orb/ are no longer soulbound! Everyone will be able to roll on new orbs that drop, and any existing chaos orbs will become tradeable.

Raid AP Bonus giving 20% AP to Melee in Patch 4.3
We actually think this change is the most appropriate way to get there.

Melee DPS is generally in a good place over the spectrum of the entire game. There are some melee specs that are too high or too low compared to other melee, but overall casters don't eclipse melee in all situations. Casters do too much damage compared to melee in raids however speaking very broadly – individual encounters can vary significantly, and there are several casters with legendary weapons at this point.

Rogue and warrior damage, to use two examples, don't need an across-the-board DPS increase in PvP. We didn’t want a solution that just buffs melee DPS all the time. Rather, we want to buff melee DPS when the melee could benefit from stacking raid buffs.

Can't deposit Unique items in the Void Storage
Unfortunately, preventing the use of unique items in Void Storage is necessary in order to enforce the concept of items being unique. Without this limitation, you would be able to have multiple copies of items that we intend to be unique. Fortunately, we don’t use the “unique” concept much any longer; we use “unique-equipped,” and items with this restriction are allowed in Void Storage.

Furthermore, we are scouring through a very large number of items in the game to convert most of the items branded "unique" into "unique-equipped".

There will still be a few unique items, such as legendaries. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/201354/cant-deposit-unique-items-into-void-storage / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3278902699?page=1#5

Raid Finder
Raid Finder loot different "appearance"
Does this mean recolored stuff like normal/heroic, or the whole item will be replaced with a new model?
Likely the items will be re-colored, if their appearance differs. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/200837/patch-43-raid-finder / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3278810692?page=3#49

Raid Finder Lockout
Completing the raid in 'LFR' mode has no affect on my eligibility for loot in normal/heroic raids?
No. Since it doesn't cause you to be locked to the raid, so you'll still be eligible for normal and heroic modes. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/200837/patch-43-raid-finder / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3278810692?page=3#59

[...] You'll still be eligible for loot in the normal and heroic modes. You can think of the Raid Finder Dragon Soul raid as being distinct from the normal or heroic mode versions.

Raid Finder while grouped in a Battle.net party?
That's still to be determined, though it's certainly something we'd like to make part of the feature. There are still technical hurdles to leap.

Raid Leader
Ideally, players who queue as leaders will want to succeed, and will ensure that they have the tools to help their fellow Raid Finder raiders succeed as well. If the raid doesn't make progress, no one gets any rewards, after all. Unlike a normal raid pug though, if one group doesn't work out, you aren't stuck, and you can try again.

Deserter Debuff
This deserter debuff is likely to be of a significant duration. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/200837/patch-43-raid-finder / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3278810692?page=7#128

Loot Roll and Lockouts
The system will distribute loot the same way a raid with locks would, without the difficulties often associated with raid locks.

For a moment, think of the Raid Finder raid much as you would any other pick up raid. In any raid, pug or organized, you only have looting opportunities one time for each boss - once that boss is dead, your chance is over for the week. The same is true in the Raid Finder. The difference with the Raid Finder will be that if your raid falls apart then you won't find yourself stuck and unable to raid again until the following week just because someone else cleared the lock out. Instead, you'll still have the opportunity to receive loot from any boss you haven't already beaten that week.Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/200837/patch-43-raid-finder / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3278810692?page=6#119

Loot Roll - Update
As an update, some of you have expressed concerns about how loot rolls will work with regard to class role in the Raid finder.

I wanted to let you know that we're aware of your concerns on that subject, and we're considering some options to address them. It's unclear at this point whether any of those options will make it into patch 4.3 alongside the Raid Finder though, or whether they're even feasible in the short term.

Inactive Guild Leader Replacement
Inactive Guild Master + Inactive Officers
That would only work if the characters in those ranks were active. If Rank 1 in a guild the rank right below guild leader has no active characters within a week of the guild leader being marked as inactive, then then game will open up eligibility to Rank 2. This will continue all the way down to the lowest rank in the guild, if necessary.

Example: Let's say a guild leader has 5 alts in Rank 1 listed as Officers. No other characters in the guild are in that rank. If the guild leader goes inactive and none of those alts have logged into the game in the past week, then the game will also allow Rank 2 characters to request leadership. If there aren't any active characters in Rank 1 or Rank 2, Rank 3 characters will be eligible. And so on.

Character/Account Activity Tracking
Is this if the account has not been active or just the character that is the guild leader?

It's per character, not per account. While we understand that guild leaders may enjoy leveling alts, we still feel that it's reasonable to ask them to log into their characters at least once per month.

The duration of inactivity isn't final, though. We'll definitely be considering player feedback and may make adjustments before patch 4.3 releases.

Is there an option to nominate someone preemptively?
This can be achieved by placing that character at the highest rank below guild leader. If you've already done so, but that rank is shared meaning, it's occupied with characters you don't feel should be guild leader, then you may wish to create a separate, higher rank for the character you'd like to be your successor. This way, he or she will be given the opportunity to adopt guild leadership in your absence first -- provided, of course, that their character has logged in within a week of you being marked as inactive.

That's simply a suggestion, though, given current functionality. Many elements of this system are not final, so feedback is absolutely appreciated.

Divine Plea doesn't grant a charge of Holy Power Note: Nop, not bad data-mining http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/divineplea.jpg
Just a quick note, Divine Plea does not generate Holy Power in the absence of the Protection talent, Shield of the Templar. This is either a bug or bad data-mining.

Please consider this an attempt to set the record straight. We really don't want players to feel like they were nerfed when this change which was never actually made was apparently reverted even though it never existed to begin with.

Doomguard "Nerf" on PTR
In 4.3, we have fixed the bug that caused the Doomguard to benefit too much from mastery. We have buffed Demonology warlocks to compensate. Also note that we have not yet completed our balance adjustments for 4.3 so what you've seen in the patch notes are mostly of a mechanical nature.

That said, we think balance is in a good place overall, so anyone expecting huge pendulum swings will probably be disappointed. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/201353/doomguard-scaling-nerf / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3279042469?page=1#17
