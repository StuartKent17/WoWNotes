Oceanic WoW Classic Realms<br>
We agree with the many WoW Classic enthusiasts in Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia that it will be a very good thing for players in that part of the world to connect to realms that are hosted in that part of the world.<br>
<br>
Planned it all along!<br>
<br>
We will have Oceanic realms for WoW Classic, with game servers hosted in Australia, at launch on August 27, and we&#x2019;ll let you know the names of the Oceanic realms before name reservations start on August 13. Thanks!<br>

WoW Classic &#x201C;Not A Bug&#x201D; List Update<br>
I&#x2019;ve updated the original post in this thread with:<br>
<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Melee leeway&#x201D; is working as intended.<br>
<br>
<br>
After careful study and testing, we&#x2019;ve found that for players with low latency, the state of melee leeway is how they would have experienced the game in 2006.<br>
<br>
There are more people with low latency now than there were in 2006, so we expect for some it might feel different, but it is working as expected.<br>
