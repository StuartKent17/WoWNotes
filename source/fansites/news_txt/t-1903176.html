Some Season 3 Warmongering Insignia trinkets should no longer incorrectly trigger its effect immediately when equipped.<br>

Armory Stats - Challenge Modes<br>
Today we are taking a look at the Challenge Mode achievement completion rate of players. The data used today is a sample of 2.1 million characters active in the last two months. We also did this earlier this year, which you can see here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4803-Five-Player-Blast-Furnace-Normal-Armory-Stats-Challenge-Modes-Blue-Tweets-DLC). <br>
<br>
The first chart looks at the overall percentage of players that have each challenge mode achievement. The second chart defines a participating player as one with the completion achievement for that challenge mode. <br>
<br>
You can click the titles in the legend to turn off and on different data types.<br>
<br>
<br>
Challenge Warlord (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8895-challenge-warlord) - 3.03% of players<br>
Challenge Warlord: Bronze (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8897-challenge-warlord-bronze) - 2.87% of players / 94.52% of participating players<br>
Challenge Warlord: Silver (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8898-challenge-warlord-silver) - 2.72% of players / 89.8% of participating players<br>
Challenge Warlord: Gold (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8899-challenge-warlord-gold) - 2.49% of players / 81.92% of participating players<br>

Classes<br>
In Legion, are we still going to fill our bags with &quot;Tome of the Clear Mind&quot; in order to change our talents?<br>
Nope! No reagents are needed to swap talents in Legion. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667064453842604032))<br>
<br>
with the inclusion of gnome hunters, does this mean we can expect other new race/class combos?<br>
We have no other additional race/class combos planned for Legion at this time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666710588974723074))<br>
<br>
If base spells change for all classes, will learning order and speed we learn them change too?<br>
Yes, the levels at which you learn each ability will be adjusted. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666692148780122112))<br>
<br>
Is leveling to110 as restore shaman going to be just using lightning bolt since we have no maelstrom power?<br>
Nope! We&apos;re adding more engaging damage-dealing rotations for all healers in Legion. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666691889047842817))<br>
<br>
any plans on HP changes for Legion?<br>
HP pools turned out fairly well in Warlords. No wide-scale changes for Legion. Couple specs may go up or down. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666692647709339648))<br>
How is it acceptable to have one level 100 player with barely 200k hp, and another with well over 500k?<br>
What issue do you see there? There are different forms of content targeting those players. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/666702060319059969))<br>
<br>
Do Moonkins and Spriests keep their in-form healing in Legion? Clarification due to the &quot;no mana&quot;.<br>
They will have some healing. We&apos;re still determining exactly what. Moonkin still have mana, it just isn&apos;t used for damage. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666704648930127872))<br>

this makes me sad. The presences aren&apos;t &quot;just clutter&quot; they have utility with movement speed and BP has saved many wipes.<br>
There will still be ways to save wipes, and a variety of utility. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666692275989147648))<br>
<br>
Hey, could u explain Marrowrend? Does it automatically activate Bone Shield (working like SotR) or can we manually use stacks?<br>
Using Marrowrend gives you 3 stacks of Bone Shield, which work as they do now. Bone Shield isn&apos;t an active button of its own. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667065604902285312))<br>

What will happen to Bloodtalons for Ferals? Will it remain a talent or something else?<br>
Bloodtalons works well as a high-risk, high-reward talent, and is remaining. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666700288573640706))<br>
<br>
So rejuvenate cant be used in feral.. Does this applies to all specs besides Resto &amp; as a feral what will be the way to heal?<br>
Still determining what heals can be used in forms. Ferals do still have the very strong Predatory Swiftness + Healing Touch. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666702844628631552))<br>
<br>
will the feral druid legendary overwrite the saberon appearance from the talent or will saberon appearance be customized too?<br>
We&apos;ve opted to remove the Saberon form, for now. Artifacts provide a huge amount of customizability for forms. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666711461947813888))<br>
<br>
If feral or guardian druids transmog their artifacts, will their bear and cat form go back to basic, or be the form selected?<br>
It will remain as the artifact-based form. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667065954631704576))<br>

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g))<br>
Run of Power &amp; Incanter&apos;s Flow. Can we please go into #Legion without these? Would mean an awful lot to many mages if removed.<br>
Rune of Power isn&apos;t for everyone, but pretty flexible nowadays. Incanter&apos;s Flow is a passive option for those who prefer it. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666705882546212864))<br>
<br>
will Ice Barrier be stronger in Legion for mages?<br>
It&apos;s hard to measure exactly, since so much changes between expansions, but in general terms, yes. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666706559594926080))<br>
<br>
Every other class can self heal, how does it appropriately fit with every other class fantasy except mages?<br>
Absorbs (such as Ice Barrier) fill the same role instead. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666709255760678912))<br>
Can do harder content with worse gear on classes that I don&apos;t know as well vs mage with absorb. Any plans to improve absorbs?<br>
Not every class is designed to be a master of sustainability. Mages are somewhere in the middle. Ice Barrier will be quite strong. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667064697707888640))<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o))<br>
SCK having a chi req.. so it&apos;s no longer spammable and can&apos;t be used without first selecting a target and generating a chi?<br>
We chose to turn SCK into a spender, so that its damage could be strong. It will not require a target. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666703255917846528))<br>
<br>
is Touch of Death staying around? it&apos;s pretty iconic to monks.<br>
Touch of Death is remaining, but it works rather differently. It&apos;s more of a cooldown than an execute. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666703945721483264))<br>
<br>
I need clarification on storm-earth-fire,Will us the main character deal 100% of the damage while both clone deal 50% damage?<br>
No. All three, including you, will deal 50% damage. It&apos;s not for use on one or two targets. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666706812251455488))<br>
<br>
will we see Chi Explosion in Legion in a new form now that chi is gone? It&apos;s one of my favorite spells!<br>
Chi Explosion disagreed with the fantasy quite a bit, and was extremely complex. Instead, we&apos;re adding other alternatives. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666706986348613632))<br>
<br>
With fistweaving gone how will mistweavers do damage?<br>
Mistweavers still have a few melee combat abilities for dealing damage. They just won&apos;t also cause healing. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666709092019236864))<br>
<br>
With their mastery changing, will Mistweaver monks still create healing spheres?<br>
There will be no more Healing Spheres as a baseline. We may add them as a PvP talent, however. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666709472971091971))<br>

Will paladins still have seals in Legion or are they a thing in the past?<br>
While they&apos;ve been around forever, they haven&apos;t delivered on gameplay, so Seals will be a thing of the past. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666701090843312128))<br>
<br>
the changes to hammer of the righteous and consecration interaction effect single target damage whether consecration is down?<br>
Yes, they do. Consecration is still worth using, even on a single target. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666703800078495745))<br>
<br>
With holy gone for tankadins. What&apos;s replacing it? Mana?<br>
Gameplay-wise, Protection Paladins will treat uses of Shield of the Righteous similar to how they treated Holy Power. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667063414091444224))<br>
They&apos;ll still have a mana bar, which is only used for healing others and utility. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667063464058224640))<br>

Do Void- and Mind Blast share CD? Or can i enter Voidform with MB, and then cast VB immediately?<br>
We&apos;re still iterating on the Shadow rotation, and looking to further differentiate gameplay in/out of Voidform. Stay tuned. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666702577791209472))<br>
<br>
is shadow word: death gone for spreists? it was so important for pvp tbh, will be really sad if it is gone.<br>
Currently, it remains, as the only true execute ability (other than Execute). (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666703447463366657))<br>
<br>
With the Shadow Priest changes in Legion, will the way Clarity of Power be changing?<br>
The new rotation is significantly different, so most talents have to be rethought. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667064883008045056))<br>

The positioning window stuff will be interesting. Is &quot;behind&quot; a 90 or 180 degree arc?<br>
Backstab is very generous. Anywhere in the rear 270 degrees counts (back and sides). (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666785842380181505))<br>
<br>
Shadowstrike... merging Ambush &amp; Shadowstep... Is Shadowstep gone in Legion? Favourite sub ability next to SDance.<br>
Shadowstrike is a merge between Ambush and Shadowstep, and replaces both. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667056657063522305))<br>

is Charred Remains gone for Destruction warlocks? Please let it be gone!!And is there any hope for fel flame? Pls answer both<br>
Definitely gone. It turned out very un-fun. Many Warlock talents are changing, and we&apos;re looking forward to feedback on them! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666700685593833472))<br>
<br>
is anything being done to address affliction warlocks aoe dps issues?<br>
Yes. Multidotting will be strong again, and Seed will be strong, especially with a talent that allows AoE application of Seed. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666703640283901952))<br>
<br>
How will Soul Swap work in Legion, it&apos;s really bad in WoD. Perhaps no cost with a CD ??<br>
Soul Swap will not be returning. However, there&apos;s a new talent, Soul Effigy, that may interest you... (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666701366870433792))<br>
<br>
I noticed Rain of Fire isn&apos;t listed as an ability in the Destruction preview. Will it still exist in Legion?<br>
RoF and FnB overlapped too much in Warlords, which is why we hotfixed RoF out of the picture until we could revise. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666704973263040512))<br>
In Legion, RoF is the primary AoE, and FnB is a talent (which doesn&apos;t obsolete RoF). (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666705047644848128))<br>
<br>
What weapon-type is the demo warlock artifact?<br>
It&apos;s a very unique artifact. We&apos;re still determining exactly how it will work for e.g. transmogrification. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667067733566074880))<br>

Do y&apos;all know if Fury&apos;s new rage dump, Rampage, will have its duration scale with Haste like Fists of Fury?<br>
Haste will reduce the GCD of Rampage, along with other rotational abilities. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666701213589594112))<br>
<br>
In Legion, if I DS Fury &amp; Arms, will I be able to equip Arms Artifact as Fury &amp; Vice Versa or will the artifact itself change?<br>
Artifacts do not swap with your spec, and are only equippable by the appropriate spec. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666710816486350848))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
is supreme lord Kazzak gear able to be upgraded with the new valor system?<br>
Yep! Enjoy those item level 715 Marks of Supreme Dooooooom! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666711075576877056))<br>
<br>
items containing multistrike will changes with Legion?Do we have to look for new equipment if we&apos;re multistrikebased spec?<br>
Multistrike will be replaced with other useful stats. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667067870916968448))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
the unhotfix of the 2nd boss of grimrail intentional or getting rehotfixed for Cms?<br>
Unintended. We&apos;ll restore the pre-patch behavior. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666804469984694272))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
and then bigger rewards like mounts/titles could be at the end of every 6-8 months or whatever of mini seasons<br>
Glad to hear people like the idea of shorter seasons. Hopefully we&apos;ll have more to share about Legion PvP soon. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/666839396331552769))<br>
<br>
With the new PvP scaling system in #Legion will managing multiple characters finally be doable? @WarcraftDevs<br>
The fact that some players want to play many characters while others only want to play one is a very challenging design problem. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/667007905841831936))<br>
<br>
Pets and Pet Battles<br>
Will we hear about Pet Battle news for #Legion at some point ?? I know there aren&apos;t a lot of us, but we&apos;re loyal!<br>
Not quite ready to talk about that yet, stay tuned (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/666828552235450368))<br>
