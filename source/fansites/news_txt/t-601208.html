<br>
First, let&apos;s start with the most important information. FREE EPIX !!!!!! Well, kinda.<br>
Monsters of Bash&apos;ir Landing can drop epic and rare equipment token, when used with 50 Apexis Shards (Dropping from the same monsters) you can transform them into decent epics and rares items.<br>

<br>
<br>
1. Ethereal guy sends you off to find a prison key. The key is a fairly rare drop from any ethereal near Manaforge Ultris. This item can be looted by everyone in the party.<br>
<br>
2. Ethereal guy sends you off to get another key and open a prison. Opening the prison will spawn a 70 non-elite that drops a green and an ID card. The ID card is required to complete the quest, but only drops for 1 person (so you have to do this 5 times).<br>
<br>
2.5. You can continue turning in ID cards for more rep, but this requires more keys.<br>
<br>
3. Ethereal guy sends you off to get 5 keys. It took at least an 1.5 hours of actual played time (not counting the frequent server crashes) just to get 5 for myself. To key an entire group would take substantially longer (there aren&apos;t enough mobs in the area to support 5 people anyway). These keys also drop from the Bash&apos;ir Ethereals in Blade&apos;s Edge, where there are far more mobs to kill, but the drop rate is still pretty bad.<br>
<br>
4. The keys combine to form another key that opens a prison in the upper portions of Blade&apos;s Edge Mountains. Opening this prison unleashes a Gronn lord. The quest recommends 5 people, but this guy can be snared, feared, everything, and you can easily 2-man kite him. He occasionally uses a ranged daze and &quot;knock-up&quot;, so you probably can&apos;t solo him unless you&apos;re a warlock chain fearing.<br>
<br>
5. Turning in the quest item that drops off the gronn lord unlocks the ability to get an additional 5 keys to summon more &quot;bosses.&quot; It also unlocks a quest to obtain a Mark of the Nexus-King, which is supposedly a non-guaranteed drop off of any of the &quot;bosses.&quot;<br>
<br>
6. Quest text says the mark will allow you to open a statis cell in Mana-Tombs, probably resulting in a new boss in Heroic mode and new loot, haven&apos;t gotten this far due to the sheer number of keys this would require.<br>
<br>
<br>
In addition, there is an altar in the Bash&apos;ir landing area where you can trade Apexis Shards for flasks (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/210/ogrila/flask.jpg). The Apexis Shards are a fairly common drop off any of the Ethereals in the area.<br>
[b]Unstable Flask of the Bandit : +20 Agi +40 AP +30 Sta<br>
Unstable Flask of the Beasts : +20 Agi +20 Str +30 Sta<br>
Unstable Flask of the Elder : +20 Int +8 MP5 +30 Sta<br>
Unstable Flask of the Physician : +20 Int +44 Healing +30 Sta<br>
Unstable Flask of the Soldier : +20 Crit Rating +20 Str +30 Sta<br>
Unstable Flask of the Sorcerer : +20 Int +23 Spl Dmg +30 Sta<br>
<br>
1) The keys that drop from the Ethereals in Netherstorm have a very low drop rate.<br>
2) Every Ethereal Spawn point, except for the guards surrounding the Nexus Prince, and possibly the other stationary ones in the proving grounds, have a chance to spawn an &quot;Ethereal Jailor&quot; instead. The Jailors have a 100% drop rate of the keys. Considering you need 5 to summon the baddies in BEM, they are amazing for saving time.<br>
3) The bosses summoned in Bash&apos;ir, after the Gronn one, are all equally CC-able. I&apos;ve fought an Eredar-Lord so far, and a Pit-Lord (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/210/ogrila/boss.jpg)<br>
These bosses can drop rare items.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
After a few kills of these bosses, you should be able to get a Mark of the Nexus King, unlocking a new quest (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/210/ogrila/quest_bade.jpg) (rewarded with Heroic Badges)<br>
Simple quest if you can stealth in, it&apos;s directly to the left in the room after Pandemonius. An ambassador pops out and says &apos;There&apos;s a being of immense power within these tombs&apos;.<br>
Then you can go back to Blade&apos;s Edge Mountains and get your reward.<br>
<br>
3 Quests are following up. One is a repeatable quest to turn in 5 keys, to summon a Bash&apos;ir boss.<br>
The second is for &quot;The second stasis chamber, should you choose to do so!&quot;, and it requires another Mark of the Nexus-Kings.<br>
You get a key (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/210/ogrila/) to open another stasis chamber to encounter ... Yor, Void Hound of Shaffar ! (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/210/ogrila/boss_mana.jpg).</div></div>
