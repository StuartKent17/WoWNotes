Boubouille2007-04-16, 11:31 PMI hate doing item listing news, but I guess I have to do it.
Black Temple is now open on the Test Realm, vendors in Shattrath and in the Black Temple are selling tons of new items, including new/unknown epics ! The one in the Black Temple sells funny consumables. Thanks to Dread from Memento Mori  for the screenshots.

There is also finally a screenshot of most all ? the new epic gems. Thanks to Ziggurat from Ropetown  for this one.

I also added all the details about the upgrades of the resistance gear. Thanks to Sil from Method  for the original screenshots.

Also added new PvP Gems price and a Netherwing reward trinket.
