Warcraft Movie Update

Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Raids
real talk: LFD and LFR, ultimately, at the end of the day, all is said and done, bad for a game?
I still don't know. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642850460651524096
If you put a gun to my head I'd say LFG with harder dungeons and no LFR. But it's a crap shoot. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642850635205865472
Easyish Naxx and LK dungeons set expectations that were hard to ever undo. Maybe LFG was just a symptom at that point. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642850895969976321
is the irrevocability of a feature a big part of the design decision or is it more if a hindsight is 20/20 thing?
For a live game like LoL/WoW you always have to think about the precedents you set. It's like being a SCOTUS judge. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642898697861206016
I wasn't paying attention during the Cata difficulty outrage--would it have been possible to soldier through?
Yes. Better would have been to provide an alternative for those who didn't enjoy wiping. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/643134188577755136

Why do you think many players are longing for TBC days. Raiding was impossible back then..
I wouldn't call it nostalgia per se, but we remember the feeling we had when everything felt so new and we miss that feeling. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/643133300358410240

Game Design
Thoughts on allowing or not respec in single player RPGs? Respec kinda waters down character building... 1/2
It depends if you want starting a new character to be a good or bad thing. No respec can encourage that. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642850183290552320

Misc
greg i really just want you to stop answering questions about world of warcraft and focus on your new better life, forever
I try to answer questions that are applicable to game development as a whole. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642898996378275841
