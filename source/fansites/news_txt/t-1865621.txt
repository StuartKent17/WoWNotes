Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Raids
real talk: LFD and LFR, ultimately, at the end of the day, all is said and done, bad for a game?
I still don't know. OccupyGStreet 
If you put a gun to my head I'd say LFG with harder dungeons and no LFR. But it's a crap shoot. OccupyGStreet 
Easyish Naxx and LK dungeons set expectations that were hard to ever undo. Maybe LFG was just a symptom at that point. OccupyGStreet 
is the irrevocability of a feature a big part of the design decision or is it more if a hindsight is 20/20 thing?
For a live game like LoL/WoW you always have to think about the precedents you set. It's like being a SCOTUS judge. OccupyGStreet 
I wasn't paying attention during the Cata difficulty outrage--would it have been possible to soldier through?
Yes. Better would have been to provide an alternative for those who didn't enjoy wiping. OccupyGStreet 

Why do you think many players are longing for TBC days. Raiding was impossible back then..
I wouldn't call it nostalgia per se, but we remember the feeling we had when everything felt so new and we miss that feeling. OccupyGStreet 

Game Design
Thoughts on allowing or not respec in single player RPGs? Respec kinda waters down character building... 1/2
It depends if you want starting a new character to be a good or bad thing. No respec can encourage that. OccupyGStreet 

Misc
greg i really just want you to stop answering questions about world of warcraft and focus on your new better life, forever
I try to answer questions that are applicable to game development as a whole. OccupyGStreet
