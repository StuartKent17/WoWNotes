World of Warcraft surpasses 11 million subscribers worldwide
IRVINE, Calif. - October 28, 2008 - Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. announced today that the subscribership for World of Warcraft®, its award-winning massively multiplayer online role-playing game MMORPG, now exceeds 11 million players worldwide. This milestone was reached as the beta test for Wrath of the Lich King®, World of Warcraft's second expansion, nears completion. Wrath of the Lich King will launch in several regions around the world starting on November 13.

"It's been very rewarding to see gamers around the world continue to show such strong support for World of Warcraft," said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment®. “We remain fully committed to responding to that enthusiasm with a high-quality, constantly evolving game experience.

Since debuting in North America on November 23, 2004, World of Warcraft has become the most popular MMORPG around the world. It was the bestselling PC game of 2005 and 2006 worldwide, and finished behind only World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade®, the first expansion pack for the game, in 2007.* In addition to being the bestselling PC game of 2007 in both North America and Europe, The Burning Crusade holds the record for fastest-selling PC game of all time, with nearly 2.4 million copies sold in its first 24 hours of availability and approximately 3.5 million in its first month.

World of Warcraft was recently launched in Russia and Latin America, and is currently available in eight languages. In addition to North America and Europe, the game is played in mainland China, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile, Argentina, and the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.

Tabard of the Achiever and "old" tabards
Yes you can delete them. While I do not recommend getting rid of the ones that are harder to pickup, you can even delete them before hitting the 25 tabard mark. I bought all of the easy to get tabards like Cenarion Expedition, Skyguard, Ogri'la, etc. and ended up at 24. So I sold these easy ones while I worked on the last one. Once I picked up the last one I got the achievement without re-purchasing the ones I sold.

Once again though, I recommend not getting rid of any of the difficult ones to get in case this doesn't work out as planned. But grats to all those who are real achievers! Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/11829579400-tabard-of-the-achiever-question.html

Retribution nerfs
We could get a similar effect by changing Wisdom to base mana instead of total mana because that is independent of the size of your mana pool with gear. As some players have pointed out, the risk would be that paladins feel that Wisdom is their only choice. 

[...] Just because you CAN be at the top of the damage meters doesn’t mean you WILL be at the top of the damage meters. That is a huge difference. But all many players hear is “I should be within 5% of the top rogue and hunter.”

Overall, the design goal for Ret hasn’t changed. We want you to be brought for your dps if for example the raid already has all of your buffs. You were just too high before. Even less skilled Ret players were very high. Even ones with questionable gear.

[...] We tested quite extensively with the JotW change, down to changing the number by single percentage points until we found a number we liked.

As far as multiple nerfs, we did try a few small changes when we made Divine Storm physical. It didn’t help much and Rets were still steamrolling other players and mobs. We needed to be more severe with the next round of changes.

Remember why we made these changes: it was to lower your dps and mana regen, so yes, those two things should be lower. We raised Blood / Martyr to make sure you had an option to running out of mana by e.g. spamming Consecration by using these Seals and Judgements for your dps.

I know some of you are saying you are still running out of mana by using only the core abilities I mentioned. But not everyone is finding that, so we need to keep investigating.

Mana drains are still something we are looking at. We could also change those to a percent of base mana. But the effects seem to vary wildly with the hunter version being fairly powerful and the warlock version much less so. Yet we aren’t exactly trying to nerf hunters in PvP either so it’s a complex problem to solve.

Making sure you aren’t waiting too long for cooldowns is something else we’re looking at. For example, we could lower the cooldown and effect of Judgements just so you are hitting the button more often. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/5/11855820926-retribution-nerfs-in-the-latest-build-2.html

Lack of proper role for Shadowpriests in raid in WotLK
VT does a lot of damage, but that's the juice we gave Shadow to be able to compete on the damage meters. We don't think it's a problem, at least for now. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/11829509263-shadowpriests-have-no-role-in-raiding-proof.html

Change to shards not before WotLK
I said down below somewhere that we have some ideas on shards. It's not going to be a fix you'll see before Lich King ships though. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/11829378987-so-about-that-soulshard-rework.html
