<br>
With the availability of the updated character models and animations that are being added with Warlords of Draenor, we&#x2019;ve seen a question pop up among the community: &#x201C;Will I be able to customize my face?&#x201D; The simple answer is &#x201C;yes.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re pleased to announce that the in-game Barber Shop will be able to provide additional facial-customization options for your character once these art updates are made available. For just a little gold, your character will be ready for any occasion and look their very best for any screenshot.</div></div>
