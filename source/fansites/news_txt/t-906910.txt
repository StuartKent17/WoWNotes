It's time for the first real preview of Tier 12 armor sets! As I said in yesterday's news post a lot of Tier 12 sets got a lot of bad feedback from the community based on poor/rushed previews, I'm not saying that they all look awesome but the Tier 12 Shaman definitely got some bad press because people couldn't render his effect properly. See for yourself. 

You can expect more previews tomorrow, and yes, I lied about the Warlock video being today, I had a slight issue with the female models and they just didn't look right. This is already fixed but I didn't want to delay the Shaman preview further. 

In any case, I suggest that you wait for the "good" previews before you decide if a set is good or bad and complain about it everywhere, for the sake of my moderators. 

PS: The armor set available to player is the fire one, the green one is most likely a recolor and will only be used for non-set or NPCs.
