Forum Mods
Learning time about Blizzard Community teams! There's a difference between Community Managers and Forum Moderators.

CMs are part of the regional Community teams, and are generally here as a representative to and from the development team, etc.

Forum Moderators are part of our Customer Support team, and are generally here to moderate the forums, delete threads, edit posts, etc.

Just for some clarity: I'm the Community Manager for WoW in North America - and there are a number of moderators in the shadows at all times, just like our in-game GMs!

From the CM side: You may occasionally see Lore or Kaivax popping in and out, especially on the PTR and Class Development forums, as they are handling some more broad-scope, less region-specific Community operations now. And I have Aeridel and Rythmor assisting me here on the forums if I'm ever out of the office, but they handle Social Media and Relationships, respectively, as their main functions. Official Forums
