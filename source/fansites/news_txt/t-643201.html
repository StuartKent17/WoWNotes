The old Ulduar Loot Summary (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=853) page has been removed from the menu and replaced with the Compiled PvE Loot List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=861). This list include:<br>
<br>
All the items discovered in Ulduar during the PTR testing<br>
Emblems of Conquest (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?item=45624) Rewards<br>
Items crafted from plans dropped in Ulduar<br>
Argent Tournament Rewards<br>
<br>
About 30 items have been added to the Ulduar loot list since the last update, the Ulduar-only lists will be available again very shortly. <br>
