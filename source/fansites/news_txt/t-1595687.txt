The Blackrock clan's unique ability to smelt the black ore, a substance so dense that ordinary flame does not even soften it, has always been their most closely-guarded secret. Deep within the Foundry, their furnace contains a primal force as old as Draenor itself, raging within the confines of its prison as it emanates a preternatural heat.


Overview - The objective of this encounter is to destroy the Foundry's massive furnace. Players must first disable the Blast Furnace's Heat Regulators, which will release the Heart of the Mountain, a blazing fire Fury that powers the furnace. Primal Elementalists then join the fight and channel beams to control the raging Fury. Once the Primal Elementalists have fallen, the Heart of the Mountain is unleashed and must be dealt with directly.

<img src="" title="Dps" /> Damage Dealers - Furnace Engineers attach bombs to random targets. Detonate these bombs near a Heat Regulator to damage them.
Defeat Slag Elementals near Primal Elementalists to temporarily disrupt their protective shield.
Interrupt Firecallers' <a href="">Cauterize Wounds</a>.
<img src="" title="Healer" /> Healers - Players in the vicinity of Foreman Feldspar suffer Fire damage as long as they are close to him.
Foreman Feldspar targets random players with his <a href="">Pyroclasm</a> ability.
Every time the Heart of the Mountain reaches 100 Energy, he will cast <a href="">Blast</a>.
Slag Elementals pick targets at random to fixate on and attack.
<img src="" title="Tank" /> Tanks - Position Security Guards so they cannot protect nearby allies with their <a href="">Defense</a> ability.
Slag Elementals fixate on random players, and cannot be taunted.
Firecallers will heal their allies for a significant amount.
When facing the Heart of the Mountain, take turns tanking in order to manage your stacks of <a href="">Tempered</a> and <a href="">Heat</a>.

Phase 1 - Sabotage - Players must disable the Heat Regulators located on each side of the Blast Furnace to disable it.

<img src="" title="Deadly" /> The Blast Furnace -

Bomb  - The caster attaches bombs to random enemies. After 15 sec the bombs will detonate.

<img src="" title="Important" /> Bellows Operator - 

<img src="" title="Important" /> Loading  - Periodically increases the heat level of the Blast Furnace by 2.

<img src="" title="Interruptable" /> Pyroclasm  - The caster hurls a massive glob of pyroclastic sludge at a random target for 70,422 Fire damage.
Rupture  - The ground beneath the target's feet rips open, revealing pyroclastic flows that inflict 56,338 Fire damage to all players in the vicinity every second.
Hot Blooded  - Foreman Feldspar's very presence burns his enemies with Fire damage.
<img src="" title="Tank" /> Melt Armor  - The caster lashes forward with their molten gauntlets, inflicting 43,000 Fire damage and melting the victim's armor.<br/>Further instances of this attack received within 30 sec inflict 30% more damage.

<img src="" title="Important" /> Volatile Fire  - Afflicts random enemies with a seed of Volatile Fire that will explode after 8 sec. When the seed explodes, it inflicts 71,450 Fire damage to all enemies within 8 yards of the explosion.
Erupt  - The caster causes lava underneath the target Slag Elemental to rise up out of the ground, heating them up. The Slag Elemental is energized to full.

<img src="" title="Important" /> Slag Elemental - Slag Elementals will go Dormant and remove the Damage Shield of any nearby Primal Elementalist when they are reduced to 1 hitpoint. While Dormant, the Fury's Blasts will restore 25 Energy. When the Slag Elemental reaches 100 Energy they will revive.

<img src="" title="Interruptable" /> Burn  - The caster inflicts 42,254 Fire damage to their current target.
<img src="" title="Important" /> Fixate  - Slag Elementals fixate on a random target, focusing their spells on the victim.

<img src="" title="Tank" /> Tempered  - Exposure to Heat from the Heart of the Mountain's attacks gradually increases damage taken from Heat. Tempered will only increase its efficacy when exposed to greater Heat levels than your current Tempered level and any time Heat is initially applied to you.
<img src="" title="Tank" /> Heat  - Heats up the victim's arms and armor. This heat inflicts 28,169 Fire damage every second for each application and is increased by the victim's Tempered level.
<img src="" title="Important" /> Melt  - The caster heats the floor under a random enemy. Players entering the affected area suffer 70,422 Fire damage every second.

CASC Patching
Ah, file bloat. In live, major patches tend to take the time to resort and scan the files to get rid of old and useless ones, which the beta doesn't.
There's some truth to this. For example, the user who simply patches from 6.0 to 6.1 on 6.1 patch day would have a different amount of data than the user who participated in the 6.1 PTR and received a dozen or more builds.

CASC is still a relatively new system, and the battle.net team will continue to work on it past WoD launch. I know file cleanup is something on their plate, but I don't have an ETA on that kind of tech.

Deleting your Data Folder in your manner is an interesting test case, I'll pass along your findings to our Battle.net team. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Challenge Modes and Tertiary Stats
Tertiary stats as well as gems will be disabled inside Draenor Challenge Modes. Not all of that is currently functional, but it will be soon.

If there are other questions or a desire to discuss the nature or purpose of Challenge Modes as a system, please start a new thread and we can read it and chime in where possible. I'd love to keep this thread focused on dungeon-specific feedback and firsthand accounts of Challenge runs on beta. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Missing the 2 Rage on Dodge for Primal Fury Guardian
Yes, we dropped it to 0; no more Rage from dodging. Celestalon 
Ok. I imagine this is only the first in a suite of Rage changes.
No, no other changes currently planned. Celestalon 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Hopefully some more Disc changes in upcoming builds, still the worst healer by far even with Silence. Thoughts on talent changes?
I don't foresee any talent changes at this point. I do believe their healing received a recent buff. holinka 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Not sure if bug or an intended change. did High Tide go through any changes recently besides the nerf to 2 extra targets?
I believe we refined the target selection a bit. It'll add targets to the CH that are within 30yd of the primary target, ... Celestalon 
...and have Riptide, up until there are a total of 6 targets hit. Celestalon 

Character / Items
Void storage is useless if you can't store items that been marked unique like some weapons, Armor, etc are in it.
Why's that? What things do you want to store multiple of? Why? Muffinus 

PvE
is the ordos restriction removed?
Yes, you will not need the cloak to fight Ordos in 6.0. Muffinus 
So how are people without the cloak going to get up to him? The same weird workarounds they have always been able to do?
Everyone gets the windy jump across the bridge! The Celestials are listening! Muffinus 

PvP
All the PvP gear on vendors that doesn't have set bonuses attached--is that intended/way for people to spend points for alt stats?
yes holinka 

Why is it that marks disappear from my team members when we do Arena? Sometimes they just.. disappear. Oo Can we get that fixed? 
Some spells remove them, like mirror image. We are working on that. holinka 

intended for BG strongbox to drop lvl 100 gear620 Ilvl to lvl 90 players?
No it isn't. holinka 

you guys have the intention of increasing the size of Ashran in future builds? There are some bigger spaces above the back area 
Yes we hope to keep expanding on it. holinka 

Lore
Then there's not much to be said here. It's mainly another orc expansion. Even as a Hordie, this is getting less original.
How do you define an "orc expansion." Is it the main antagonist? The guys on the box? The final boss? Mobs you fight most? _DonAdams 
Orcs push the driving action of the story. Other characters are largely passive and react to the orcs.
Is it possible it's just the juxtaposition of SoO with an orc-heavy expac leading to this feeling? _DonAdams 
Possible, yes. Though I'd argue if you play Alliance, orcs have been the central antagonist since Cataclysm.
How so? Cata was Deathwing, the elemental lords, and the Twilight's Hammer. MoP was mogu, mantid and sha. _DonAdams 
Certainly Thrall and Garrosh played big roles, we've been building up Garrosh for awhile now. But orc-centric? _DonAdams 
Ultimately we arrived at having to solve a big crisis, but it was largely caused by our own actions. _DonAdams 
Cataclysm largely feeling like I was a glorified janitor cleaning up messes so Thrall could steal the glory.
Yeah, there's a reason you almost never see Thrall in MoP. He had too big of a presence in Cata. _DonAdams 

This also kind of presents a point: surely there's room for situations where the protagonists are driving the action.
This is a good point. I think that was the beginning of MoP - both factions rushing to explore a new land. _DonAdams 
5.4 felt kind of underwhelming. I don't have a polite way to phrase how I felt about 5.3.
Sorry you didn't like it - was it primarily the content Barrens or the story that threw you? Working w/ Vol'jin? _DonAdams 
I would have preferred it if Jaina or Moira had filled the same role for the Alliance.
For what it's worth, there are WAY more faction-specific quests in WoD. Spires is mostly neutral, but it's unique. _DonAdams 
Heading out for the weekend, but thank you for the chat! I want the Alliance to feel invested and badass. _DonAdams 

Rilak and Kirrik from BC are in the Order of the Awakened. So did the Order turn into the Shattrath arakkoa exiles?
Order of the Awakened did not exist in the BC timeline. It's a product of your actions in Spires of Arak. _DonAdams
