How will glyphs that don't alter spells be handled? i.e. priest glyph of angels
Things like Confession, Treant Form, Illusion likely learned from tomes. Angels likely triggered by a certain spell. WarcraftDevs

Will DH's GCD be 1 sec or 1.5 sec? Also are there any plans to alter any other classes GCD?
1.5 second base, reduced by haste similar to most other non-energy melee. WarcraftDevs 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 
holy paladin in legion raiding, stand in melee? Or back with range? Or bounce between the two groups?
Depends on the fight. Sometimes Holy Paladins will prefer to stand with ranged, sometimes with whomever they're healing. WarcraftDevs 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 
Any chance Pistol Shot for Outlaws might see unique animation/unique gun? Gret concept let down by a Vanilla Blunderbuss model
The current art for Pistol Shot in the Legion Alpha is temporary. It will have a new gun and animation. WarcraftDevs 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 
So will aff/destro locks have any form of burst cooldowns other than summon Doomguard/Infernal since dark soul is gone?
There are a few talents that improve burst, and the Doomguard/Infernal are being buffed to deal significantly more damage. WarcraftDevs 

Artifact Wepaons
Will our artifacts be able to unlock additional relic slots at some point?
Artifacts start with 2 relic slots and unlock a 3rd shortly after reaching 110. We're not planning any additional slots. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
does this mean tank specs will be viable in PvP also?
We're looking into ways to make tanks fun - both to play as, and to play against - in PvP. It's a tough challenge. WarcraftDevs 

why not just make racials unavailable for pvp?
We feel racials are an important part of what defines your character, and should come into PvP with you. WarcraftDevs 

Lore
Mr.Koask could you please clear the situation with Vol'Jin? You said he is warchief and in quests it's Sylvanas! what happened?
If you're checking out the alpha, you're only getting part of the story, none of the intro, and none of the cinematics. Yet! DaveKosak 

Transmogrification
Rumor from alpha is clothies can unlock cloth transmog but plate cannot. Intended behavior?
Intended. Plate wearers unlock plate, mail wearers unlock mail, etc. Weapons must be equippable by that character. WarcraftDevs 

If I unlocked the CM armor during MOP on one warlock, if I make another will I be able to XMOG it on him with the new system?
Yep! Any characters of the same class will be able to wear the Challenge Mode sets if you've unlocked them. WarcraftDevs 
Can we discuss that "Weapons must be equippable" thing for staves/polearms?
I refuse to discuss polearms after "the incident". Muffinus 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
I see. I was watching some legion alpha streams and artifact stuff looks promising, can't wait to test/play it.
I agree. Looks cool. Shades of Paths of the Titans, down to titan names. OccupyGStreet 

How do you keep your team motivated when deadlines loom and setbacks start to/have happened? How do you boost morale?
One of the best things for morale is shipping things and seeing it in the hands of players / customers. OccupyGStreet 
Newbie managers sometimes focus too much on individual feelings during a time of crisis. OccupyGStreet 
When actually your team may thank you later for being decisive when Shit Gets Real. OccupyGStreet 
You can focus on the softer aspects of team morale when you have more bandwidth and fewer deadlines looming. OccupyGStreet 

Hey, GC, how hard is it to take a wow boss mechanic, like Shadow Crash, and make it a player ability? Is it technically hard?
If it's tied to the room geometry target this x,y coordinate then it can be hard. A lot of class abilities started with bosses. OccupyGStreet 

I understand, do u think redesigning classes every xpac is a good idea? I despise having to relearn the specs I play esp. 1/2
I like class change. I was sad in WoD when the direction was minimal change. But having to relearn is the big risk. OccupyGStreet 

what is a Devs definition of "Balance" equal everything or as close as balanceable?
Depends on devs and projects. Usually it's something like decisions of what / how to play aren't driven by raw power. OccupyGStreet 

Systems designers distinguish between "balanced" and "balanceable" and focus more on the latter since it's a lot harder. OccupyGStreet 
how do unbalanceable things form? i.e. by what general mechanism does a system/mechanic become unbalanceable?
Things are balanceable if they have tuning knobs. A switch with on/off lacks tuning knobs. OccupyGStreet 
An ability that is "kill next target" doesn't scale with target health or power, so you lack an ability to tune it. OccupyGStreet 

like why make it balancable if you don't then use that work to try achieve balance.
Totally. Balance is the end goal and the most important in the end. We just talk about the hard part which is balanceable. OccupyGStreet 
Sadly, what isn't balance-able is community perception. Once they believe something is bad, it's hard to change that view.
That's true, but players don't owe use endlessly trying something to see if it's finally fixed yet. OccupyGStreet
