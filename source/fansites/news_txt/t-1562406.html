Talents<br>
<br>
Dream of Cenarius (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108373)<br>
<br>
Balance: The talent has been redesigned for Balance Druids and now causes Moonfire (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8921) and Sunfire (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/93402) casts with Lunar or Solar Peak to also heal a random injured ally. Casting Healing Touch (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5185) no longer increases the damage bonus of the Druid&#x2019;s next Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577). Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577) now causes the Druid&#x2019;s next Healing Touch (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5185) to become instant cast and reset the cooldown on Starsurge (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/78674).<br>
<br>

Frost Changes<br>
<br>
The Brain Freeze (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/44549) effect now increases Frostfire Bolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/44614) damage by 25%, and can now stack up to 2 times. It also no longer triggers from the Bomb Talents, and instead has a 10% chance to trigger from Frostbolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/116) casts. Each Multistrike of Frostbolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/116) increases that cast&apos;s chance by an additional 25% 45%. (Total of 60% 100% on double-Multistrikes).<br>

<br>
Surge of Darkness (Shadow) now has a maximum of 3 charges (up from 2) and can now also trigger its effect from Devouring Plague (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/124467), but its chance to trigger has been reduced to 10% (down from 20%) to compensate.<br>
Surge of Light (Discipline, Holy) activation chance has been reduced to 10% (down from 15%).<br>
<br>
Solace and Insanity has been split into Power Word: Solace (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/129250) for Discipline and Holy, and Insanity for Shadow.<br>
<br>
Insanity has been changed to cause consuming Shadow Orbs (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/95740) to transform Mind Flay (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/15407) into Insanity for 2 seconds per Shadow Orb consumed.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman <br>
Elemental Overload and Molten Earth<br>
Chain Lightning (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/421) was also improved significantly to offset the fact that Elemental Overload was a massive buff to it, but Molten Earth is not.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

Riptide (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/61295)&#x2019;s healing has been adjusted to put significantly more of it into the initial heal. The initial heal amount has been increased by 70%, while the periodic healing amount has been reduced by 20%.<br>

<br>
<br>
Arms Changes<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Talent Changes<br>
<br>

<br>
Warlords of Draenor - Quest Markers on the World Map<br>
Starting in Talador, you&apos;ll soon start seeing quest bangs on the world map for major quest lines that you are eligible for but don&apos;t have in progress. Other zones will follow shortly after.<br>
<br>
This system is designed to act as a backup mechanism should you fall off of a quest line for some reason. While it is not terrible if you&apos;re guided to content this way, it is still our preference that we lead you there smoothly through the quests themselves, and only have this as a backup should you miss something.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re very interested in hearing feedback on this system as you start to experience it. Also, if you somehow miss a major quest and end up depending on these map bangs to lead you back, we&apos;d still love to hear about those too so that we can look to reduce the chances of missing them.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your help with this. We hope you enjoy this new feature.<br>

Warlords of Draenor Theorycraft Discussion<br>
Is there a formula or &quot;rules of thumb&quot; for determining a targets hitbox size and geometry?<br>
Shape is always circular. Creature hitbox varies, of course. Player hitboxes are consistent though the exact size rarely matters (I believe it&apos;s 0.5yd radius). <br>
<br>
What actually matters is combat reach. That&apos;s always 1.5yd for players, and larger for larger creatures. The distance away that you can attack a creature is...<br>
<br>
Melee attack: MAX(5, SourceCombatReach + TargetCombatReach + 4/3) + IfSourceAndTargetAreRunning(8/3)<br>
Ranged attack: SourceCombatReach + TargetCombatReach + AttackRange + IfSourceAndTargetAreRunning(2)<br>
AoE: TargetCombatReach + AttackRadius + IfSourceIsRunning(2) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/318876-warlords-of-draenor-theorycraft-discussion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13087818929?page=26#503))<br>

Have you ever considered instead of tweaking individual abilities to give everyone a &quot;tuning&quot; passive ability?<br>
Yeah, we have that under the hood for emergencies (see Brewmasters on live). Results in a more cohesive game if we don&apos;t tho. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491757001827831808))<br>
<br>
From a healer&apos;s perspective where will incoming tank damage be in Warlords&apos; raids? More attention needed than MoP? Wrath? =)<br>
More than MoP. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492048280310669312))<br>
<br>
There is a difference between a spec needing balance and most players idea of &quot;competitive&quot;.<br>
People tweet me all the time with questions like, &quot;Do you intend for &lt;spec&gt; to be lackluster this &lt;exp/tier&gt;?&quot; So silly. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492045689128374272))<br>
&quot;No, we&apos;re shooting for abysmal. More tuning to come!&quot;<br>
Haha. I&apos;ll use this next time I&apos;m feeling especially snarky. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492046635170398208))<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Y))<br>
Frost DKs: 2H will prefer to use KM on Oblit, and DW on FS, as has been intended for a while (but tuning was off in late MoP). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491825861700489216))<br>
We know this, but there is no incentive wait for OB to come off CD to use KM on it. Its a dmg loss right now for doing so.<br>
Right, that&apos;s the part about &quot;tuning was off in late MoP&quot;. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491835554401497088))<br>
how&apos;s it a tuning issue?<br>
It was not tuned to be worth it. That&apos;s a tuning issue. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491839901600477185))<br>
It&apos;s a mechanical issue. Not a tuning issue. Have to use runes to start the feedback loop.<br>
So? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491840717048668161))<br>
Therefore KM can never &quot;matter&quot; to 2H Frost. Useless mechanic.<br>
Extreme example: Triple Oblit&apos;s damage. Now you will prefer to use KMs on Oblits. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491841434043949057))<br>
another example You are empty on runes w/ only runic power. You will still use KM on FS.<br>
Yes. That&apos;s why I said *prefer to*, not *only*. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491849047909470208))<br>
What will make Obl worth using in WoD for DW frost dk&apos;s?With enough mastery howling blast will do more dmg cause frost dmg scale<br>
Rime helps with this. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491861804369190912))<br>

Whats the intent of Tiger&apos;s Fury change? Removal of need for macro? Concerned about PvP burst with midberserk TF for more nrg?<br>
You already could combine them as long as you knew to use TF first. It was a pointless limitation. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491726806383202304))<br>
<br>
Pool up to 100 -&gt; Berserk -&gt; Dump to 40 -&gt; TF -&gt; Dump to 0.<br>
Sure, you&apos;ll do that, which we&apos;re fine with. It&apos;s damage that you&apos;re going to use on Bite; worst Energy-&gt;Damage conversion. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491727585554874368))<br>
<br>
Can you expand a bit on the new MF/SF eclipse changes? Did the snapshot idea not work? I like the changes I&apos;m just curious.<br>
Yeah, Eclipse is no longer snapshot. As such, you can now afford to use MF/SF as mobile damage options, without reducing DoT dmg. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491731564154204160))<br>
So, it looks like you recast the dots right before hitting opposite Eclipse to maintain uptime? At least MF.<br>
You can&apos;t recast both at any time. You only need to MF once at peak, and SF once at peak and once at start/end of Solar (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491835826595061760))<br>
<br>
Is Shooting Stars 5% for most recent MF and SF, or 5% for just whichever of those is most recently applied?<br>
5% for both. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491838851652923392))<br>

liking the new hunter raid CD, even if it doesn&apos;t benefit them<br>
It does, a little. Powershot and Focusing Shot. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491744485101948928))<br>
<br>
With the new Aspect of the Fox, could we have a little clarity on &quot;all spells&quot;?Will it include abilities like Focusing Shots?<br>
Yes. I&apos;ll clarify the tooltip with &quot;and abilities&quot;. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491744232281874432))<br>
Thank yooou, and one more question.Does it include items (i.e hearthstone)?<br>
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491745570768158720))<br>
<br>
Oh, hay. Is a dps cool down still being considered for SV?<br>
Not beyond what&apos;s in the talent tree and effectively available through ES pooling. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491747765660049408))<br>
<br>
is the new fox cd on global or off?<br>
In an upcoming build it&apos;ll be off the global, and usable while casting something else (like Spiritwalker&apos;s Grace is). (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/492003407910023168))<br>

any concerns that Empowered Seals force reti and protto juggle seals to keep all 2/3 buffs active or is the intended game play?<br>
That&apos;s the intention. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492041926011412480))<br>
any plans to make it feel less clunky atm created alot of seal switch reminds me of warrior stance dance<br>
No, that&apos;s the point; it&apos;s a talent to let you opt into seal twisting. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492043118913388544))<br>

Is there a reason Dragon Roar is not on the AoE Knockback list for diminishing returns?<br>
I believe because of the extremely short nature of it; it&apos;d be a penalty use, instead of a benefit. Same as the Charge stun. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491726641492549634))<br>
<br>
that was specifically TC damage going down 30%, not all damage. (Though arms could probably use a flat 30% cut)<br>
Yeah, I just meant TC damage going down 30%. All Arms damage is still going to go down across the board too, though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491747976071507968))<br>
<br>
ie is TClap down to 10 rage now, with WW at 20, or is Tclap still at 15 while WW is 20?<br>
TClap at 10, WW at 20, MS at 20, Execute will use up to 30 additional rage instead of 50 (same total dmg). Slam is slightly... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491739675548086272))<br>
...different; couldn&apos;t really reduce the rage cost of a 10 rage ability by 1/3. so instead increased its damage by 50%. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491739787657625600))<br>
is tclap intended to be used single target for arms now unless you take the slam talent?<br>
No, it&apos;s still much worse damage than WW. Tclap is primarily for the snare. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491743938605092864))<br>
Any chances TC radius glyph will make a return? Piercing howl has 15 yards radius. Fury won&apos;t have aoe snare?<br>
The WW range glyph will also apply to TC. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491856072148131841))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Any chance we might see Elite difficulty fights in WoD? Like Protectors in ToES. Loved Yogg Saron, would like to see more<br>
No specific plan in place for the 6.0 raid content, but it&apos;s something we can/will do where it makes sense. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/492006024086175744))<br>

Lore<br>
Would you consider Khadgar, based on his views and persona, to be an Alliance character? Is he in the Alliance for convieniece?<br>
Khadgar is an Alliance character willing to give quests to individual Horde heroes he trusts. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/492025336867979264))<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t get this. I can understand khadgar being neutral aligned because of his Outland experiences but the KT has never been fully neutral except in world-threatening circumstances. 3 of the 6 members of the current council of six were there when kael was thrown into the violet hold. Jaina does more face heel turns than a catwalk model but I think khadgar would be way outvoted<br>
He is. But that doesn&apos;t stop him from doing his thing. Would love to be a fly on the wall in Council meetings! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/492024610817187841))<br>
<br>
Hey any chance Exarch Naielle, Exarch Malaadar, and Yrel come back to the main universe and possibly exarch akama as well?<br>
Not determined yet! We&apos;ll see what people think of the exarchs. You&apos;ll meet other rangari in other zones, as well. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/492024147115900928))<br>

A question: Will keeping the Trading Post be required to keep the exalted status with Laughing Skull/Shattari Defense?<br>
Not as planned, no. Some buildings can be exhausted and then replaced over the course of the expac. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/491747244958183425))</div></div>
