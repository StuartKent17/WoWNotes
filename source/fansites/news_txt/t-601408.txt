Boubouille2007-06-21, 10:22 AMTo recap the issue: after the maintenance, patch release, and end of season 1, it became apparent that not all teams that were intended to receive their Gladiator title and Armoured Nether Drake did in fact receive them. Instead the rewards seemed to be sent to some teams while others only received lower ranking titles.

At this time it only appears to have affected select realms. Since then we’ve been able to determine that the issue was specifically an error in rewarding teams appropriately. We’re currently in the process of testing a fix, using data recorded from when the realms were brought down for maintenance to determine if this fix will correct the issue.

We're waiting for the fix to be tested before discussing how the issue will be resolved as we simply don't know what the best available course of action we can take is until we have a working solution.

We’ll be providing further updates in this thread as we’re able.
