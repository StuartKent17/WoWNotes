The Call of the Scarab http://ptr.wowdb.com/world-events/638-call-of-the-scarab holiday event remembers the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj http://wow.gamepedia.com/Gates_of_Ahn%27Qiraj world event from Vanilla. This event is an Alliance vs Horde showdown, with the victorious faction flying their faction banner for the next year. 

The Call of the Scarab http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/45785-call-of-the-scarab quest will send you to Silithus so that you know where the vendor and world quests are. From there you can complete quests and defeat bosses to earn Commendations for your faction. Whichever faction has the most Commendations at the end of the event wins. 

Cultist Camps

There are Twilight Cultist camps scattered around the zone.
You will need to kill NPCs in the camp to acquire all three Cultist pieces: Twilight Cultist Cowl http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143858-twilight-cultist-cowl, Twilight Cultist Mantle http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143857-twilight-cultist-mantle, Twilight Cultist Robe http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143855-twilight-cultist-robe
Once you have applied all three pieces of the disguise, you can use a Lesser Wind stone to summon a NPC that you can solo. 
These drop Abyssal Crest http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143865-abyssal-crest and remove one of your armor buffs when summoned. 
Abyssal Crest http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143865-abyssal-crest are dropped by the Lesser Wind Stone bosses at the Cultist Camps.
The Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143867-twilight-cultist-medallion-of-station can be used at a Wind Stone to summon a boss that might need a group.

General Mythic Plus

When originally designing Mythic dungeons for Bfa, the team added additional mechanics to trash on Mythic difficulty, but toned it down a bit further into the design process.
The team strives to to make sure they're not doing anything that's going to play really poorly with Mythic Plus.
The team learned from Legion that any mechanic involving damage ramping up over time has to have a soft cap for Mythic Plus or the fight becomes nearly impossible on Tyrannical.
The team likes having rotating affixes each week to try and push people into different areas and different parts of content in a way that keeps it hopefully feeling a lot more fresh and interesting.
The team likes variance, but if an affix or dungeon has too many outlying difficulty problems then they want to address those and bring them in line with the difficulty of other dungeons/affixes.
It's actually a fixed list of hand-picked or hand-crafted affix combinations that come up every week.
Fortified and Tyrannical are not being looked at for changes. Part of the problem these two affixes had was the seasonal affix Infested, which is going away. These issues will likely take care of themselves with its retirement.
Reaping creatures don't gain Fortified themselves, but the way everything works is that the creature will spawn with half the health of the creature that dies, so in that regard it gets a small percentage of Fortified.
Reaping enemies are only indirectly affected by affixes that alter the enemy trash's health amount. They do not gain damage bonuses or other effects.
There are no immediate plans to allow people to delete their keys or swap for a new one, but the issue has been discussed among the team.
Instead of giving players the option to delete keys, the team would rather bring the unpopular dungeons in line with the difficulty of the more popular ones.
If your group doesn't have a key that you want to run, the ability to look for other keys in dungeon finder is an option.

Mythic Dungeon International

If you can do a certain number of Mythic Plus keys in time, that actually gets you invited into the Time Trial stage, and from there everyone's on the Tournament Realm.
The Tournament Realm will give everyone an equal playing field with the same gear.
