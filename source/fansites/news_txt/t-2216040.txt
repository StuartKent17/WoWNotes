What is the new PvP scaling cap? I am currently at 918 Item levels and I still keep getting more stats as my ilvl increases. Thanks
Buff from item level still 0.1% stats for every 1 item level over 800. But the base template is now tuned to item level 900 up from 850. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/859836449939570688

Since 7.2 I've gotten one mining 3 star. Still have multiple at one star.
3-star gathering items and questgivers are still appearing. They’re quite rare! Their drop rates may increase a bit in a future patch.WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/859829265436557312

Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Re: warforged/titanforged. Why knowing exact date, when you will finish your gear - is bad thing? Some players, including me, pick content according to amount of effort, needed to finish it. Potentially endless grind - is thing, that drives me away from certain content. This is the reason, why I play Wow and don’t play Diablo.
Your arguments are largely from the point of view of a player, which makes sense. But there are at least a couple of reasons why it could be bad for a developer.

There are so many great games out this March, that I don’t know how I will play them all. I almost need reasons to be able to call one done and put it down so I can move on to another one. But if I put a game down, there is a chance I may not go back to it. I stopped playing Final Fantasy XV near the end, and if you know anything about the end, you may have predict that I may never pick the game up again. I’m a churned FFXV player. I keep meaning to go back to WoW and Diablo and Dark Souls 3, but I haven’t yet.

If you finish a tier in WoW, maybe you’ll go back when a new tier comes out. But maybe you’ll be heavily engrossed in another game. Maybe you’ll have adjusted to a new gaming schedule. Maybe your raid will have already replaced you. There is inertia to keep not playing once you start not playing. This isn’t a WoW-specific issue. It can happen with almost any game.

The subscription model complicates this for a couple of reasons. First, if you take a break for a month or two, you aren’t paying for a month or two. And if you churn, you may never pay for a month again. There is also the value proposition from your point of view, that if you’re paying for a month, you want content that lasts for a whole month. 

When I was working on WoW, it was always with the expectation that players were always hungry for more content. I was as relieved as anyone when my guild finished a raid tier and didn’t have the long hours and tense fights for a time, but I often still wanted stuff to do in WoW.

If I ever worked on another MMO and I almost certainly won’t I think I would investigate a business model that is more like the standard box and expansions. When a new tier comes out or maybe even a dungeon or class?, you purchase that tier, but then you don’t pay by the month. I think that’s more conducive with the way I like to play games, where sometimes a new game comes out and I want to drop everything and play it, or I want to take a break even from a game I love.

That was a long answer already, but I also still think it’s important for random dropped loot in WoW or any game that has it to feel exciting. When the loot starts to be too predictable, it can feel good in the short term to have more control over its acquisition, but in the long run the game can just feel more like a treadmill and the exciting moments of opening the mystery gift box just don’t land any longer.
