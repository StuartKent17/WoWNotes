2 days ago I talked about a bug in Skald making the fire elemental instantly respawn after a kill. It was supposed to be fixed in a future patch but it seems that Blizzard managed to hotfix it, you can start selling your [item=21884] at awfully high prices again !


It's a bird ! It's a plane ! No ! It's super reindeer !
It's christmas ! Well, it's not, but if you keep tons of holiday items in your bank you might have some [item=21213] you'll be happy to know that it will turn your flying mount into a flying reindeer ! There isn't any timer on it and it should lasts as long as you stay on your mount.

Virus on some Maxtor hard drives
Lately a news concerning Maxtor hard drives became very popular, I don't know how old the press release is but it seems that a few Maxtor Basics Personal Storage 3200 products got shipped with a virus affecting online games, including World of Warcraft. If you've got one of them it might be a good idea to run an anti-virus scan.

If you have purchased a Maxtor Basics Personal Storage 3200 product since August 2007 the product may be infected with a virus. Kaspersky Labs, a maker of anti-virus software, has alerted Seagate to the existence of a virus found on at least one Maxtor Basics Personal Storage 3200 product. Seagate has traced this issue to a small number of units produced by a Maxtor sub-contract manufacturer located in China. Seagate quickly put a stop ship to units leaving the facility as soon as the company learned of the probable infection. All units now leaving the facility in question have been cleared of the virus and units in inventory are being reworked before being released for sale. However, some affected units may have been sold to the public before the problem was detected. Seagate apologizes for the inconvenience that has been caused as a result of this incident.

According to Kaspersky the virus is the Virus.Win32.AutoRun.ah, a molar virus that searches for passwords to online games and sends them to a server located in China. It also deletes other molar viruses and can disable virus detection software. All of the known games affected are Chinese with the exception of World of Warcraft. The following games are affected.
