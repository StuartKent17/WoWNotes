Totem hotfix. Sorry shamans. And rogues, and DPS warriors, and hunter's pets.

Windfury Totem will no longer trigger for any “yellow” attacks unless they are on next swing attacks, such as Heroic Strike and Cleave.

Voice Chat on PTR
This mean two things, 2.2 Patch should be live within 2 or 3 weeks with enough luck. This also means that they're considering cross-server battleground voice chat. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've never read about it before, but I'm often wrong 

New testing servers, more room for testing, hurray. And more ganking in Ghostlands, obviously

We will be activating Voice chat on the PTR with the new build tomorrow morning August 10th.

Voice chat is currently available only for parties, raids and custom channels; there is no cross-server battleground voice chat at this time.

Please be aware, that this is a brand new feature and although it has been tested by Blizzard QA there are still many outstanding issues and we expect to find many more as we roll it out to a larger test group. Please be diligent in reporting bugs either via this forum or the in-game feedback tool, and be patient with us while we work out the kinks in this new system.

In order to facilitate additional testing, a second PVP server has been brought online, and the server population limits have been increased to lessen queues.
