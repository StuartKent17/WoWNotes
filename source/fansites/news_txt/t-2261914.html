Frost Death Knight in Patch 7.3<br>
Row 75 on next PTR:<br>
<br>
Inexorable Assault updated to: &quot;While in combat with no enemy within 8 yards, you gain Inexorable Assault every 1 sec. Each stack causes your next autoattack to deal [100%AP] additional Frost damage.&quot;<br>
It&apos;s stealing the distance-based mechanic from the proposed White Walker--where we agree it didn&apos;t always accomplish as much as we&apos;d want. Also, the attack-based version of IA would likely have been awkward to waterproof against weird rotational shenanigans.<br>
<br>
The third talent, this iteration, will be a version of Volatile Shielding that increases AMS&apos;s absorb and RP generation (and nothing else). In keeping with IA--we&apos;re experimenting a bit with allowing some damage payoff in a &quot;utility&quot; row in the case of a spec like Frost that isn&apos;t getting strong movement bonuses. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1067136-frost-death-knight-in-73/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20757697601?page=14#268))<br>
<br>
Elemental Discussions - Patch 7.2.5<br>
Few updates--potentially not on the upcoming PTR:<br>
<br>
1) Not going forward with the Maelstrom generation change. It&apos;s generally way too much disruption and potentially new problems introduced for something that&apos;s meant to be a somewhat minor set of changes in this patch. Given all the feedback that was concerned about the slowdown it would cause on 2-3 targets, it&apos;s okay to leave Chain Lightning generating resource so quickly on 5 targets--it&apos;s a less bad problem overall, and also what people are already used to on live.<br>
<br>
Reverting the Maelstrom change is also effectively a further buff to Earthquake damage. This should be a clear net buff to steady AoE where Earthquake can be used well (which is not every AoE situation). It may not completely cause Earthquake to surpass Chain Lightning, but it is a big step in that direction. We&apos;ll likely tweak numbers further to balance all these concerns/goals. Namely:<br>
--Helping out Earthquake substantially<br>
--Not causing a large buff to AoE damage in steady Earthquake-friendly situations<br>
--Not causing a large nerf to Chain Lightning-only burst (which is a strength that Elemental is used to in Legion)<br>
<br>
2) Slightly buffing Elemental Blast&apos;s own damage to mostly cancel out the reduction to the stat buff, as discussed earlier.<br>
<br>
3) Buffing Frost Shock in parallel with Earth Shock. We still need to look into Frost Shock interactions with the 7.3 set bonus if we go forward with that bonus.
