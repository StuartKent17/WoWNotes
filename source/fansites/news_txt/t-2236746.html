Character / Items<br>
Do you continue to gain stamina per point past 52 in concordance?<br>
Yes, your health increases at a reduced rate compared to prior points. However, tank + healer bonus damage doesn&apos;t increase after point 52. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/871796808627789825))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
could we get an explanation on why s3 pvp elite appearance is being released at the end of s4 <br>
The ensembles become available when those appearances can no longer be obtained in rated PvP. Legion Seasons 3&amp;4 share an armor appearance. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/870729017216741376))<br>
<br>
does anyone know if u account change a char if u have to do 150 wins all over again?<br>
No, transferring a character to another account does not reset the number of wins-- only a faction transfer resets the number of wins. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/872529155736219648))<br>
<br>
Could you guys take a look at southshore vs. Tarren Mill again? Particularly at the balance, for the alliance. Thanks.<br>
We learned a great deal from this first run of Southshore vs. Tarren Mill, and we&#x2019;ll make adjustments for next time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/872560517918871552))<br>
<br>
is Concordance capped at 52(first pt) in rated pvp?<br>
There is no cap. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/872560757912633344))<br>
<br>
Can you verify that you need 150 wins on a toon to get Gladiator Legion Season 3 or just for R1?<br>
Both Gladiator and Cruel Gladiator require 150 wins. All other titles require 50 wins. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/872560886266736641))<br>
<br>
WIll saved up pvp tokens (Echoes) go away with the end of season? Or will they persist through season end?<br>
They are converted to gold at end of season. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/872668203024924674))<br>

Muff man! where is Varimithras the best dreadlord ever its not a secret is it?<br>
No one knows, but one thing&apos;s for sure: Sargeras probably isn&apos;t too happy with him. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/870660828315262978))<br>

The murloc demon hunter in Stormheim during invasions - is he canon? If yes, how did he come to be?<br>
