Latency Issues<br>
We&#x2019;re aware some players are experiencing ongoing latency issues while trying to play World of Warcraft. We&#x2019;ve taken steps to investigate the cause, and at this time we&#x2019;re confident that our systems and network are performing properly. We are actively collaborating with our industry contacts to assist in the diagnosis and hopeful resolution of broader internet latency issues, which are suspected to be the cause of degraded performance. <br>

World of Warcraft Magazine #4<br>
From what I understand the fourth issue will be on it&apos;s way shortly and if you were subscribed for the first year, you will be receiving this issue in your mailbox soon. You can check out the fourth issue&apos;s cover art as well here- http://cde.cerosmedia.com/1A4d80e47506a60012.cde/page/1 It has a goblin vs. worgen theme.<br>
<br>
That said though, if you haven&apos;t resubscribed as of yet, you can do so on the site. We understand if you are disappointed in the wait times to receive your issues, but have been working with Future to make sure that the issues you are receiving are top quality.<br>
<br>
Information on the fourth issue, including a sneak peek, can be found on the official WoW Magazine site here- http://www.worldofwarcraftthemagazine.com/?gclid=CM6G_IL756cCFQE2gwodHDeCcg<br>
<br>
As for exclusive content, the artwork is exclusive on the cover and within the pages as are the interviews that you see with Blizzard Staff along with other insights shared within it from other community members etc. Those are not revealed anywhere else save for if the magazine has already been released to paid subscribers, guaranteeing that no one else sees it before you do.<br>
<br>
That said, the magazine is meant to be a bit of a keepsake of high quality (perfect for your coffee table) and we&apos;ll continue to keep an eye out for constructive feedback to pass along to Future, or you can reach out to them directly should you wish. I&apos;m sure they&apos;d love to hear from subscribers.<br>
