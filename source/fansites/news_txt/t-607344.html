The season 4 item lists are now fully translated in German and French, I can&apos;t promise I&apos;ll do that everytime there is a major feature added to the game because it takes a tremendeous amount of time, but I guess it will make a few people happy.<br>
<br>
The remaining parts of each parts of each post will be translated later today, any help on the german version would be greatly appreciated. <br>

The9 Manually Set Chinese Realms&apos; Isle of Quel&apos;Danas Progress (Via WoWinsider (http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/05/02/wow-china-gets-all-access-pass-in-queldanas/))<br>
&quot;The9, the company that operates World of Warcraft in China has announced today that all Chinese realms will have their Isle of Quel&apos;danas progress manually set to be fully completed, since &quot;all players have contributed as they should to the world event&quot;. They also apologized for the server problems players experienced these past few weeks, while wishing everyone a happy Mayday (a four-and-a-half day holiday this year in China).<br>
<br>
This rather drastic measure comes amidst widespread player complaints of their servers&apos; poor performance after patch 2.4. Many of the more populous realms suffered frequent restarts and periods of downtime, especially at peak hours. As a result, a significant number of these realms also fell victim to rollbacks. Some of the hardest hit realms had their IQD progress reset multiple times in a single day.&quot;<br>
