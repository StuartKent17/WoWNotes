Boubouille2008-04-02, 10:23 AM2.4.1 Updated patch notes
I also included the undocumented item changes and a few more changes, mostly from Elitistjerks 

The list of undocumented changes might be updated during the day.
 Hunter
Tranquilizing Shot no longer incorrectly restricts use of other Hunter abilities in specific situations.



User Interface
Combat Log
Only the last 300 combat log entries are now stored.
Filter settings are now properly saved. Source 
Changing zones will no longer reload the entire log



Bug Fixes
Fixed a sound engine error that was causing lock-ups on exit.
Fixed a shader error that was causing kernel panics on Mac PowerPCs.
Fixed a bug on Mac that was preventing the intro Cinematics from playing.



Undocumented world changes
All NPCs in normal and presumably heroic Magister's Terrace give reputation at their previous levels, giving about 2k per normal run.
The bombing run daily quest on Quel'danas has been changed : Eredar Sorcerers now die in one hit instead of two, Pit Overlords die in two hits instead of three.



Undocumented items changes
The following items have been changed to Main hand instead of one-hand : [item=25920], [item=32537], [item=34667], [item=34670], [item=34671], [item=34790]
[item=24128] doesn't die anymore at the end of the timer and just fades away.

Ordinn also gave an ETA for the end of registrations.
Sign-ups will continue until the third phase of the tournament. 


Quel'danas offensive progression - Impact of daily quests
How many daily quests do you need to complete a % of the offensive ? A lot according to Drysc. He also talked once again about the unlocking of the Anvil, this is the last phase needed to unlock the new heroic badge rewards.
We're not releasing specific information about unlock times, turn-ins, etc. but to give a vague estimate... hundreds and hundreds per %.

The armory takes about five times as many turn-ins to capture compared to the sanctum. Remember, only the NPC's that show your percentage of completion give quests that count towards unlocking... whatever it is they say they're trying to capture/build.

Badge Vendor comes with the anvil, which isn't available to build until after the armory is captured. Just like the portal is an "addition" to the sanctum, the anvil is added to the armory once it's been captured through a separate daily quest.


2008 Arena Tournament registering and server lags
First, the server lag on Arena Tournament realms is mostly fixed and you should be able to play with a decent ping now.
Please try to go in to the realms now. The lag entering matches should be fixed. The vendor and general lag should be better, but if people continue to spam-click the items in the vendors there will still be bad lag while making purchases. 


2.4.1 and bug with models
A few people have been experiencing bugs with their items most of the time a "checkerboard model" showing instead of the item after installing a patch, most of the time it's because you used a model editor or something like that and you will probably have to reinstall the game to fix the problem.
The checkerboard box models will appear if the data for that object is missing. All known objects should be linked. If you end up getting any types of Error 131s and/or more of those objects, you may have to reinstall the game. The original issue is usually seen if someone used a model editor. Possible outcomes are checkerboard objects and error 131s in certain zones after applying patch 2.4.0


Other blue posts
Players pulling Doom Lord Kazzak away from his spot
- People on flying mounts can kite him a good distance to the west. also can be done by a pali using bubbles Is this intentional?
- If intentional means there are mechanics that allow people to move him around a bit, then sure. We will continue to watch this and make adjustments if needed. Source 

Guards and PvP
It's not really "a punishment for trying to PvP", it's a restriction on where we want you to be able to PvP. Even then the restriction is fairly fluid, you could potentially get away, or harass someone a little. We don't feel it's necessary to have uncontrolled murdering and mayhem in a place that people may just want to check their mailbox. If you want to kill them wait until the guards can't see you. They're going to leave town eventually. Source 

AH "Scamming"
Players are allowed to place an item for sale at whatever cost they feel appropriate, it is at the buyer's discretion to view the price and agree to purchase it. While the actions of the seller may be underhanded, the problem comes down to the purchaser ensuring their money goes where they want it to, which you have full control over. Ensure it's of a reasonable price, and don't click the confirmation button unless you're confirming you want to purchase it. Source 


WoW TCG - Servants of the Betrayer
The latest expansion of the Trading Card Game has been released, and three videos showing the new loot in actions have been posted on WoWTCG.com , we finally get to see the weather machine and pet biscuits in action, as well as the [item=35226]

The first item on display is a new variety of loot - one that has a really high drop rate and is consumable. Each Papa Hummel's Old-fashioned Pet Biscuit Loot card can be redeemed for 50 Pet Biscuits from Landro. The pet biscuits can be used on cosmetic pets, giving them a buff that increases their size. Check out the first video below to see just how big they get!

Up next is the Personal Weather Machine, a reusable item that gives the player a small weather system over the character's head. Each effect lasts for 30 seconds, and at the end of the effect, there is a chance that another random effect will be generated. The video shows off some of the fun effects you'll see when you use the item. The weather effects remain in effect even while mounted so even if you're questing in the darkest parts of Shadowmoon Valley you can take some sunlight with you.

Finally we come to the long-awited X-51 Nether-Rocket, an exclusive flying mount. You can blast off at both normal and epic flying speeds, both available for purchase in Booty Bay. Just like with other mounts, the riding skill of the appropriate level is also required to use the mounts.
