chaud2019-06-25, 07:11 AMPatch 8.2 - Professions Overview
Much like Patch 7.3 in Legion, Rise of Azshara offers a variety of new recipes and items to craft or gather.


All Kul Tiran and Zandalari professions have an additional 25 points added to the cap, for a total of 175 from 150.
New recipes have been added to each profession that require these new 25 points.
All gathering professions have new materials to collect.
There are items you can find in Nazjatar that unlock specific profession focused events. Activating these events will have you complete a task and provide a bounty of materials or benefits for your profession.



The Abyssal Focus
In Nazjatar, crafters will build up a new crafting station called the Abyssal Focus. This forge is used to craft the new raid gar instead of using consumables from the raid such as Sanguicell https://www.wowdb.com/items/162461-sanguicell.


A series of quests increase the rank of the focus.

Restored Abyssal Focus - Crafts up to Item level 410 gear
Empowered Abyssal Focus - Crafts up to Item level 425 gear
Radiating Abyssal Focus - Crafts up to Item level 440 gear

Quests

The first quest to restore the focus is Ancient Technology https://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/56346-ancient-technology.
After you have to collect 15 Abyssal Shard https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/169326-abyssal-shard for the quest An Abyssal Opportunity https://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/56347-an-abyssal-opportunity to upgrade it.
You then are given the quest We Can Make It Stronger... https://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/56352-we-can-make-it-stronger and are sent into Azshara's Eternal Palace to collect Eternal Ornament https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/169329-eternal-ornament.
There is likely another step involving the raid after this quest as the previous quest only unlocks the Empowered Abyssal Focus.

Once you unlock the next rank, you can craft any gear at the focus of the allowed item level or below.
