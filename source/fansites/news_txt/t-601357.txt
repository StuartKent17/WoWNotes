Boubouille2007-06-06, 07:33 PMBased upon further feedback from guilds in Black Temple and Hyjal, we've decided to make some difficulty adjustments to many of the later bosses. As a general rule, the changes increase the damage dealt by the encounter to the raid. Note that due to the timing and nature of the changes made, some of the tooltips for the retuned abilities will be incorrect.

The encounters changed include:
Gurtogg Bloodboil
Teron Gorefiend
Mother Shahraz
The Illidari Council
Illidan Stormrage
Archimonde

Our intent is not to make the encounters impossible. Even with the increased difficulty, I do expect some of them to be quickly beaten again after guilds experience the changes and adapt.
As a side note, the 2.1.1 patch did include the change to the Archimonde encounter that increases his leash distance and made the Well of Eternity a bad place for casters to be near.

Armory
Blizzard released a new armory http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/#index.xml only available on the US site for the moment. 
Basically, they've got their own item database site now, you can search items based on item filters, bosses loot tables, etc ...

Few sample of what you can do : 

Lady Vashj Loot Table http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/#search.xml?searchType=items&fl [source]=dungeon&fl [difficulty]=normal&fl=21212

Black Temple loot list http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/search.xml?fl%5Bsource%5D=dungeon&fl%5Bdungeon%5D=3959&fl%5Bboss%5D=all&fl%5Btype%5D=all&fl%5BusbleBy%5D=all&fl%5BrqrMin%5D=&fl%5BrqrMax%5D=&fl%5Brrt%5D=all&advOptName=none&fl%5Bandor%5D=and&searchType=items&fl%5BadvOpt%5D=none
Items only dropping in Heroic Mode for hunters http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/search.xml?fl%5Bsource%5D=dungeon&fl%5Bdungeon%5D=dungeons&fl%5Bdifficulty%5D=heroic&fl%5Btype%5D=all&fl%5BusbleBy%5D=3&fl%5BrqrMin%5D=&fl%5BrqrMax%5D=&fl%5Brrt%5D=all&advOptName=none&fl%5Bandor%5D=and&searchType=items&fl%5BadvOpt%5D=none

Like any other item database, Blizzard only adds item once they're dropped, you can't get Illidan loot table here.
