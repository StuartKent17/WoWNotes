Nithogg and Fury Warrior Artifact Appearance Hotfix<br>
The recent hotfix we&apos;ve implemented is something we were planning to make in the future, but we&apos;ve moved it forward into 7.2.5 as a small quality of life change. As a note with this, the current logic behind the new drops from Odyn is the same as other appearance drops from raids.<br>
<br>
We know that this does not solve the problem of Nithogg not spawning recently, and we realize that&apos;s an outstanding issue. In an upcoming patch, we will be moving World Bosses to a set spawn rotation from the current random spawn rotation, which should help avoid this issue in the future.

Raid Finder Target Audience<br>
I&apos;m not trying to be patronizing or anything but it would seem to me that LFR is designed for someone like you. (IE. &quot;not a person who raids much&quot;, &quot;playing for 7 hours weekly on average&quot;)<br>
<br>
By your own admission you don&apos;t raid much, so why should it bother you that those that participate in LFR have gear that is LFR caliber? If you wanted to avoid the &quot;gear treadmill&quot;, couldn&apos;t you do mythic+?<br>
I love doing Mythic+. I&apos;ve tried RF before and didn&apos;t like it as much as normal mode. It&apos;s something I DON&apos;T want to do, which is often an arguement used against Anti-LFR people. However, with cutting edge gear, I feel pressured to do it to be relevent. If it were gear like 870 to 880 in ToS LFR, I wouldn&apos;t have this problem.[/i]I do have to agree with the post you&apos;re quoting. I don&apos;t think high-end mythic+ dungeons are designed for someone with such a limited amount of playtime, whereas Raid Finder is. <br>
<br>
I don&apos;t mean this to sound harsh, but you&apos;re basically refusing to participate in, what most consider, relatively easy content as a means to upgrade your gear.<br>
<br>
Raids have always been and will continue to be the cutting-edge end-game content providing the best gear. This isn&apos;t a new concept, and Mythic+ just provides a means to achieve a similar* end at a broader scope with less commitment to raid schedules.<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t think people are here to troll or lambaste you on purpose, you&apos;re just a part of a community where a vast majority of people do LFR, even if just for gear, but yet you say you refuse to do it. I&apos;m not sure what you&apos;re expecting here.
