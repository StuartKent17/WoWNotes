PvP Scaling Changes
Level 110 -120 PvP Scaling
We're preparing a hotfix to go live soon which will widen the power gap a bit between players between 110 to 120. This means that, for example, a 120 will be stronger against a 115 after the hotfix than they are on live today.

Regarding lower level players being stronger at a lower level than they would be at max level, we haven't found that to be the case. Though to be fair, that was regretfully the case in some situations in beta and on live because of bugs.

In the case of Venruki, we loaded both characters internally and tested the scenario exact spell sequences, etc. with his Druid opponent at max level with gear the same iLevel as his Mage. Venruki would still of lost in that scenario if the Druid was at the same level and iLevel as him, so it is not a scaling issue between players of different levels but perhaps something else 1v1 class balance, item choices, etc..

Actually, the PvP scaling changes are now live. We'll continue to monitor things and make changes where necessary. Thanks everyone. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

PvP Scaling Below Level 110
There is no scaling below 110

Except... There is: 
This was a bug with the resilience stat scaling, which has been fixed. There is no scaling tech applied to player vs player combat under 110. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 


Developer Interview - Sylvanas isn't Another Garrosh
PCGamesN  has stated in a presentation at Gamescom, producer Michael Bybee has addressed the issue of people claiming that Sylvanas is Garrosh 2.0.


There are no plans to repeat stories from previous expansions as in Garrosh
There are other plans in store for both the Alliance and the Horde in terms of story.
Sylvanas's burning of Teldrassil is just one part of a larger story that the team is planning to tell and has been planned out for a long time.
The story of Battle for Azeroth is very long.
The team is super excited about where the story is going to go and is not going to do to Sylvanas what was done to Garrosh.
When Eurogamer asked  about Teldrassil growing back, Bybee said "It is a magical tree, and it's not the first magical tree"
