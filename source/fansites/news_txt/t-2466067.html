Mythic Jaina has once again been defeated on Mythic difficulty by Method! Congratulations to them! Sco was interviewed by Red Bull (https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/wow-battle-for-dazaralor-world-first-interview): <br>
<br>
<br>
It took 347 attempts to defeat Jaina.<br>
Sco liked the bosses and atmosphere of the raid, but it was ruined somewhat by the first eight bosses dying so quickly<br>
