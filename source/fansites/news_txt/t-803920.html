Hopefully, I won&apos;t crash the site or kill a moderator, but if it happen I&apos;m sure the guy who will replace me after I get fired will be as nice as I am. <br>

Cataclysm Dungeons Pages Updated<br>
I finally updated most of the Cataclysm dungeons pages to let you prepare before the release! If everything goes as planned, I&apos;ll probably have some extra time for the Deadmines/SFK pages and we might have a couple of strategy guides, maybe. Thanks to Marlamin (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/622014) and Simca (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/545200) for their precious help on these pages. <br>

Leaders of the Alliance and Horde Part 1 - Garrosh<br>
King Varian Wrynn, Queen Sylvanas Windrunner, King Genn Greymane, and Trade Prince Gallywix&#x2014;these are just a few of the leaders who continue to shape Azeroth&apos;s destiny. They are the embodiments of their races&apos; strongest traits... and at times their greatest failings. In the coming months, Blizzard Entertainment will be releasing short stories that will peer into the hearts of these legendary heroes and offer insight into what new trials might lie ahead as they lead their people in a world forever changed by the Cataclysm.<br>
<br>
The first story of this series, &quot;Heart of War, (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/cataclysm/features/garrosh.html)&quot; offers a glimpse into the experiences that have shaped Garrosh into the leader he is today: his heroic exploits in Northrend; his uncertainty as he arrived in the imposing Horde capital of Orgrimmar; and most importantly, his friendship with his mentor, the warchief he would eventually replace, Thrall. This tale was written by Sarah Pine, the winner of Blizzard Entertainment&apos;s 2009 Global Writing Contest.<br>
