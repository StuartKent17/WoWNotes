Patch 7.3.2 - November 28 Hotfixes
In addition to the PvP hotfixes posted last night , Shadow Priests had some changes.

Priest

Shadow

Void Eruption  no longer deals a separate damage event for each of your Shadow Word: Pain or Vampiric Touch on each target. Instead, it now deals a single damage event to all targets that have either your Shadow Word: Pain or Vampiric Touch.
Void Eruption  damage increased by 700%.
Shadow Crash  cooldown reduced to 20 seconds was 30 seconds, Insanity generation increased to 20 was 15, and Missile speed increased by 60%.
Mind Sear  Passive damage increased by 50%.
Heart of the Void Legendary increases Void Eruption’s damage by 75% was 300% and heals you for 25% was 40% of the damage done.

Developers’ note: This is compensation for the Void Eruption buff. The overall effect is mostly neutral.

Shadow Word: Pain  damage reduced by 4%.
Vampiric Touch  damage reduced by 4%.

Developers’ note: This is compensation for the Void Eruption buff in extended fights.
