chaud2016-10-11, 10:15 PMWithered J'im
Something went a bit awry with our World Boss rotation this week, and we're aware that J'im is active again. Our intent here is for these bosses to be on a more spread and even rotation so we don't have encore situations like this one with our good friend J'im.

We don't have any plans to change anything this time around, but going forward we will work to make sure we aren't doubling up or more on a particular boss week-by-week.

So in other words, you guys have no actual interest in doing anything about such an obvious problem when you can just go "oops our bad deal with it." 
Thanks for showing the community how much you don't care about the quality of your product.
In my mind fixing it now that it's live would be a bad experience for people who have already killed him, or an even worse experience for those that didn't kill J'im while he was up if they got to kill two bosses in a week.

Raid Testing Schedule - October 13-17
On Thursday, October 13, and Monday, October 17, we will be conducting focused raid tests of Trial of Valor bosses.

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.
