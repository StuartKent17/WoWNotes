WoW Classic Demo Playtime Limit and Cooldown<br>
Playing the Classic Demo<br>
When the World of Warcraft: Classic demo becomes available to play at home on Friday, November 2, we will ensure maximum availability to players at home by initially establishing session limits.<br>
<br>
When the demo goes live, we&#x2019;ll use a playtime time limit and a cooldown (that starts when you first log in) to help as many people as possible play the Classic demo as much as possible. We&#x2019;ll start with a playtime limit of a cumulative 60 minutes and a cooldown of 90 minutes. Here are some examples of how that might work:<br>
<br>
<br>
If you play for 30 minutes and then log off for 60 minutes, when you come back you&#x2019;ll have a fresh 60 minutes.<br>
If you play for 60 minutes, you&#x2019;ll be disconnected and then have to wait 30 minutes before you can play again.<br>
If you play for 20 minutes, log off for 20 minutes, then play 40 more minutes, you&#x2019;ll be logged off and wait 10 more minutes.<br>
<br>
Our goal is to lift session limits as quickly as we feasibly can after the demo goes live. We will then only reinstate session limits if unexpectedly high demand returns.<br>
<br>
We will update this post with further information on this, as necessary.<br>
<br>
Thank you!</div></div>
