A few minutes ago, Ensidia (http://www.ensidia.com) completed the Trial of the Crusader in Heroic Mode without allowing any raid member to die on any encounter. They are the first guild in the world to complete A Tribute to Immortality (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4079/a-tribute-to-immortality/), congratulations to them!<br>

They were rewarded with a brand new Crusader&apos;s Black Warhorse (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49098/crusaders-black-warhorse/), the alliance version is the Crusader&apos;s White Warhorse (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/68187/crusaders-white-warhorse/)<br>
