Pet Battle Bonus Event – December 30 - January 4
Through Monday, January 4, Pet Battle experience gains are increased by +200%. There’s never been a better time to get out there and level up your mighty minions!

Before you head out into the wild with your lower-level wild things, make sure you pick up the quest “The Very Best”. Because you’re the best – around – you’ll want to queue up for PvP Pet Battles with a team of three level-25 pets. After only five wins during the event, you’ll be rewarded with an Ultimate Battle-Training Stone, which means another level 25 is on its way to your collection.

One of the things I love is Highmountain quests divided in questlines like the Divine Bell achv
Yeah, we prefer that format too. I'd expect to see that for the other zones a bit further down the line. craig_amai https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/681232411808546816
