This time, we can really say that TwentyFifthNovember http://www.twentyfifthnovember.com/ cleared all the PvE content currently available in Wrath of the Lich King. They managed to kill Sartharion with all his adds up and were rewarded with the Reins of the Twilight Drake http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/november/sarthdrake.jpg! I'm not really sure if it's worth discussing whether it was too easy or not, just keep in mind that they're the best PvE guild in the world for the moment, that's 60~80 players out of 11 millions. 

Congratulations to them, once again.

Upcoming Feral changes, Part II
On the subject of weapons, this change should be transparent to most druids. You will end up having a few more items that you can use, but your feral staves will continue to do the damage they do now. If it makes it clearer, imagine that feral attack power is not going away as a concept, but weapon dps will instead translate to their current FAP values. This is also not license for us to never again add weapons which are optimized for druids. It should just provide more options in between major upgrades.

On the subject of armor, the intent of the change is to give you more options in which trinkets and other jewelry you use, instead of always having to rely on the relatively rare bonus armor pieces. We don't think the solution of just dropping bonus armor pieces everywhere is a great one either -- no single stat should trump the others by that much. The change isn't intended to be a nerf at all. A lot of numbers have been thrown around in this thread. Give me some time to review them and see where any discrepancies lie.

Our design remains to have fewer specialized items drop so that more loot is actually valued by someone in the group. A lot of the druid itemization was a relic of the older system and we have been wanting to convert it over. But with any change like this, it may take some time before all of the rough edges are smoothed over. To use a tired cliche, the designers tend to take the stance that the design of WoW is a journey not a destination.

On the myriad of other topics...

I realize some players have made some passionate and intelligent arguments for other ways in which bears can scale from gear. That isn't something we are going to do at the moment, but something we may investigate in the future. I understand that it's fun to improve tanking gear, and while we don't want it to be such a burden to get the +armor pieces, we also don't want the choices to be so meaningless that you aren't gearing for tanking at all. Let's see how things stand after these changes go live.

We are not adding additional weapons that druids can use at the moment, but we may consider it in the future.

Block is a very good stat now, and we have read a lot about the notion that "unblocked hits are the new crushing blows." We don't want the block mechanic to mean that death knights and druids and possibly even paladins are left behind. Again the goal is to have four viable tank classes. That doesn't mean identical, but it also doesn't mean that druids get swapped out for some fights or relegated to permanent off-tank status.

Change to Warlock summoning and soul shards
We are. I attempted to preface the post above so that we wouldn't get a lot of "THAT'S IT?!" responses. This is *a* change. It is not *the* change. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12891371312-upcoming-warlock-summoning-change.html
