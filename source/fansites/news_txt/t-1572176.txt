Looking For Adventure
To start browsing for groups that are looking for more you'll want to open Group Finder Bound to the I key by default then click on the Premade Groups option for PvE content such as questing, dungeons, and raids.

Within the Player vs. Player tab, you can create premade groups for Arenas 2v2, 3v3, 5v5, Arena Skirmishes 2v2, Battlegrounds, and Rated Battlegrounds. You can also access the Player vs. Player pane directly Bound to the H by default. Additionally, there’s a custom option to allow you to create groups for things not on the list, such as forming a raiding party to do a little world PvP in a capital city with a few new friends.

Once you’ve identified a group that looks promising you can sign up to join it; the group leader will be notified that your pending join request needs their approval.


Recruiting For Danger
Those who want to take matters into their own hands can form groups by selecting ‘Start a Group’. Here’s a breakdown for what the different fields are for.

Name: Give the group a name. It helps if the group name is something descriptive like “UBRS run”.

Type: What is the purpose of the group? Questing? Running a Dungeon? Running a Normal raid, etc.?

Requirements optional: You can elect to use it to specify additional requirements, such as a minimum item level or use of voice chat to facilitate communications.

Minimum Item Level optional: It’s important to note that the minimum item level requirement must be less than or equal to your own item level.
Voice Chat: Some groups may prefer members joining Voice Chat in game for greater coordination.
Description optional: A place available for those that want to provide more information, such as loot rules, or other information pertinent to the group.


When your settings are ready, simply click ‘List Group’ to be listed.


Holding Out For A Hero

Players applying to join the group show up as potential applicants where the group leader can accept or decline. For raid groups, both the raid leader and players identified as raid assistants share the ability to accept or decline applicants. Additionally, raid groups will be able to see what ranks the applicants have attained in Proving Grounds Bronze, Silver, or Gold. Meanwhile, a tally of the different roles in the group so far is reflected to provide an overview of how the group formation process is progressing.

These changes and more await, making it easier to find like-minded players. Good luck, and happy grouping!
