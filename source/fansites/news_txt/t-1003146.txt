The panel is in progress and this post will be updated constantly! Check back in a few seconds!


Talents 2.0

Major change to class talent trees, and this is a new phase of development for the talent system.
The goal is to have you sit to another next to another combat rogue, and this combat rogue will actually have different talents than you do!
Character customization was the original point of talents in the first place but overtime cookie cutter builds dominated the scene. 


New Model

Class Abilities are available to all specs in the class. All warriors learn heroic strike for example.
Spec Abilities are available to certain specs. Only Arms warriors learn Slam. Retribution and Protection paladin get Hammer of the Righteous, etc ...
Talents are optional skills/bonuses available to all specs. Any warrior can choose Throwdown, and you will have to pick between 3 different crowd control abilities on this level of talent.
Level 15 - You pick your first talent. For example, warriors have to pick between Juggernaut / Double Time / Warbringer and players will have to pick which mobility ability they want to pick depending on their playstyle.


Talent Philosophy

Access to stuff you never could before. If you were a subtlety rogue you knew you weren't going to get something like Killing Spree. And because talents are going to be all in the same tree, you're going to be able to combine them in a way that you never could before. For example, any rogue can have Shadowstep!
Several new, overpowered feeling talents will be added to the game. 
If you don't see a beloved talent in your new talents list, don't worry, it's probably something we gave your spec as a baseline. For example all Holy priests now have Circle of Healing.
No mandatory talents anymore.
Every choice should be hard but fun!


Talent Preview

Design will iterate a lot on individual talents
