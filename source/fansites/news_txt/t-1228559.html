Happy Thanksgiving from the Community Team!<br>
The Community team will have a reduced presence on the forums while we are spending time with our loved ones for the Thanksgiving holiday. The forums will still be moderated while we are gone and it will be back to business as usual on Monday, November 26. We hope you enjoy your time in Azeroth and we look forward to talking about World of Warcraft with you all when we return.<br>

Misc<br>
What&apos;s an average Pandaren lifespan? Roughly humanlike? 100s? 200s?<br>
Roughly human... <br>
<br>
Any Plans to ever make secondary skills account wide? Leveling fishing on an Alt is horrible. <br>
Have you tried Cooking in MoP? It has a good catch up mechanism. We&apos;d rather do catch ups than just never have to do it again. <br>
<br>
What Fishing Catch-Up? 3 dailies a day, each giving 1 fishing point isnt much of a &quot;catch-up&quot;. And book is 900g. <br>
There is no fishing catch up. My example was applying the cooking catch up to other professions. <br>
<br>
Are you guys going to (eventually) allow Blacksmiths to repair their own equipment or carry a portable anvil? <br>
The risk with repair costs is it&apos;s one of our largest gold sinks in the game. They might could be cheaper? <br>
<br>
How did you guys come up with The Klaxxi? <br>
The mantid are cool and we wanted them to have more depth and not feel like silithids. Also needed a good Dread Wastes hook. <br>
<br>
I just faction changed, and was sad to learn that we no longer get the equivalent of opposite-faction mounts. Why the change? <br>
Account level mounts had some side effects. We are working on a plan for how faction change should work with account-level stuff. <br>
<br>
Do you think that needing to be exalted with Klaxxi is a little steep for 363 weapons? Most will have better before then. <br>
Klaxxi weapons are intended primarily for transmog not as awesome weapons. <br>
<br>
Can you go into details about what we can spend the charms on? <br>
For now just bonus rolls. We might add to that, but we like that you can &quot;cap&quot; charms in a reasonable time so it&apos;s risky. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261149465065451520))<br>
<br>
Are the developers talking about inventory space issues at the moment? Would love a Dev Watercooler on the subject. <br>
Our inventory system feels outdated. But, we don&apos;t want the solution to be that you just hoard every thing you ever find. <br>
<br>
Is there a design constraint on why Prospecting doesn&apos;t allow queuing like making bolts of cloth? <br>
Because the game doesn&apos;t know which minerals in your bag to consume. Would need a new UI.<br>
<br>
You guys always blame addons for player problems.. why don&apos;t you rule some of them out by programming them yourselves? <br>
We do if we think specific UI functionality is necessary enough to make it default. But we like allowing additional customization. <br>
<br>
I thought Daelo was the lead encounter designer? What happened? <br>
Scott Mercer (Daelo) is still with Blizzard, contributed a great deal to Mists, and currently working on other things.<br>

Fan Art - The Stonecore<br>
Praetus shared (http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/12yb3e/hey_rwow_im_a_3d_artist_and_have_been_creating/) a nice rendition High Priestess Azil&apos;s (www.wowdb.com/npcs/42333-high-priestess-azil) room in the Stonecore (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/5088-the-stonecore) with us. There is a thread on Polycount (http://www.polycount.com/forum/showthread.php?t=98217) that may give you an idea of the amount of effort it takes to create new art. <br>
