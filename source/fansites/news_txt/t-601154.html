The most important changes are :<br>
<br>
<br>
Can now automatically import characters from Blizzards armory site by goto Options -&gt; Import Armoury Character and pasting the URL. Please note that character specifics line hair style, skin/hair colour, etc are not imported. Just Race / Gender / Items.<br>
Pushing Control+F1-F3 now temporarilly saves a models poisition, rotation, and the Field of View at the time. To restore this data you can do so by pushing F1-F3 without Control.<br>
Yup, you can now import models from the Armory.<br>
<br>
If you&apos;re interested, you can get my custom npcs.csv here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/boubouille/npcs.csv), it doesn&apos;t change much things, it just adds most of the Karazhan bosses and Serpentshrine bosses to the NPC list (File &gt; View NPC), Lady Vashj model is available in the Creature &gt; Ladyvashj directory, the Lurker Below is just above and is named Krakken.</div></div>
