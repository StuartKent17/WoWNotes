Blue Tweets
One of the tweets notes the change http://beta.wowdb.com/items/133767-lucent-stormforge-ring#20810-20914 to remove Strength, Agility, and Int from the few Legion necks, rings, and cloaks that have been added so far.

With all the mobility in Legion for other casses some additional gap closer for DKs would be great. 
Not every class should be highly mobile. That being said, check out the "Death's Flight http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/208277-deaths-flight" talent for Unholy! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/688107350369042433

Can you clarify if Prot Paladins still hit 5 targets with Avenger's Shield in Legion?
Avenger's Shield will hit 3 targets baseline, but there may be ways to increase that number. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/688108659063193601

Its currently better to not cast lava burst at all on alpha, lightning bolt trumps it in every way.
This isn't something we are seeing, and it is certainly not intended. Can you share any details? WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/688108788608417792

Character / Items
On the alpha, why do rings and necks not have int, strength, or agility on them?
Weâ€™re experimenting with different designs for how rings, necklaces, and cloaks are itemized. Hang tight for details! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/688106098746769408

PvP
Will there be any customization with stats in PvP left? e.g. able to spend some of the template on a certain stat
What type of customization did you do in the past that you liked? Picking a secondary stat to stack? holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/688119391494393856

Will the new Pvp system in legion be introduce to all levels in the pvp range starting at level 10
There will be a chance to win items at the completion of a battleground; similar to dungeons while leveling. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/688134340568432640


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
how important would you say math is to game design? or is it all done by computers now?
Math is very important to systems design. Most designers I work with are reasonably skilled at math, and some are experts. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687365750256877568
If you are building levels, narrative or maybe UI, math is less essential. Anything that involves combat is inherently numbers. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687365974064893952
I'd add that you're gonna need good, solid, time-tested vector math if you want anything moving on screen.
It depends how your studio divides design work and engineering work. Math is part of almost all engineering. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687373680867848192
If you're making UI and you want stuff moving around and feeling interactive, math looms ahead!
That may be. I designed a lot of UI for AoE and WoW and never used a calculator. I did for classes and items. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687373528019013632
