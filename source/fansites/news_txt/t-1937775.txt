Overview - Rawr, imma bear.

<img src="" title="Dps" /> Damage Dealers - Stand in Ursoc's path when he uses <a href="">Focused Gaze</a> to reduce the amount of damage <a href="">Barreling Impact</a> inflicts.
Avoid <a href="">Barreling Momentum</a> when afflicted with <a href="">Unbalanced</a>.
<img src="" title="Healer" /> Healers - Stand in Ursoc's path when he uses <a href="">Focused Gaze</a> to reduce the amount of damage <a href="">Barreling Impact</a> inflicts.
Avoid <a href="">Barreling Momentum</a> when afflicted with <a href="">Unbalanced</a>.
<img src="" title="Tank" /> Tanks - Ensure that no tank overlaps the effects of both <a href="">Overwhelm</a> and <a href="">Rend Flesh</a> at the same time, taunting when necessary.
Stay out of the proximity of Nightmare Images to avoid <a href="">Nightmarish Cacophany</a>.

<img src="" title="Tank" /> Overwhelm  - Ursoc overwhelms a player's defenses, inflicting 1,680,000 Physical damage. This reduces armor by 20% and increases damage taken by <span style="color: White">Rend Flesh</span> by 100% for 12 sec. This effect stacks.
<img src="" title="Tank" /> Rend Flesh  - Ursoc viciously rends a player, inflicting 1,350,000 Physical damage and an additional 790,000 Physical damage every 2 sec for 12 sec. 
<img src="" title="Important" /> Focused Gaze  - Ursoc focuses his gaze upon a player, charging them after 6 sec and striking them with <span style="color: White">Crushing Impact</span>. Upon reaching his destination, Ursoc strikes all players with <span style="color: White">Barreling Impact</span>.

Barreling Momentum  - Ursoc charges through any players to his target, inflicting 435,000 Physical damage to all targets in his path and knocking them back.

Unbalanced  - Players in Ursoc's path struck by <span style="color: White">Barreling Momentum</span>, suffer 500% increased damage from <span style="color: White">Barreling Momentum</span> for 50 sec.

<img src="" title="Important" /> Barreling Impact  - When Ursoc reaches his marked target, he inflicts 1,290,000 Physical damage to all players. This effect is reduced by each player Ursoc has charged through.
<img src="" title="Deadly" /> Crushing Impact  - Ursoc inflicts 714,000 Physical damage to the target. This damage is reduced the further away the target is from Ursoc.

Roaring Cacophony  - Releases a mighty roar, inflicting 3,670,000 Physical damage divided evenly among all players within 20 yds.

Nightmarish Cacophony  - Whenever Ursoc roars, he leaves behind a Nightmare Image. On subsequent Ursoc roars, the Nightmare Image also releases a mighty roar, inflicting 500,000 Shadow damage divided evenly among all players within 20 yds. This effect causes players to run in fear for 6 sec.
Miasma  - Nightmare Images project a zone of miasma 20 yds around themselves, inflicting 120,000 Shadow damage every 1 sec to players caught within.
Echoing Cacophony  - Echoes increase the damage done by <span style="color: White">Roaring Cacophony</span> by 10%. This effect stacks.

Blood Frenzy  - Ursoc enters a mighty rage at 30% health remaining, increasing attack speed by 20% and damage done by 20%.



Blue Tweets
One of the tweets notes the change  to remove Strength, Agility, and Int from the few Legion necks, rings, and cloaks that have been added so far.
Classes
 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 
With all the mobility in Legion for other casses some additional gap closer for DKs would be great. 
Not every class should be highly mobile. That being said, check out the "Death's Flight " talent for Unholy! WarcraftDevs 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 
Can you clarify if Prot Paladins still hit 5 targets with Avenger's Shield in Legion?
Avenger's Shield will hit 3 targets baseline, but there may be ways to increase that number. WarcraftDevs 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 
Its currently better to not cast lava burst at all on alpha, lightning bolt trumps it in every way.
This isn't something we are seeing, and it is certainly not intended. Can you share any details? WarcraftDevs 

Character / Items
On the alpha, why do rings and necks not have int, strength, or agility on them?
Weâ€™re experimenting with different designs for how rings, necklaces, and cloaks are itemized. Hang tight for details! WarcraftDevs 

PvP
Will there be any customization with stats in PvP left? e.g. able to spend some of the template on a certain stat
What type of customization did you do in the past that you liked? Picking a secondary stat to stack? holinka 

Will the new Pvp system in legion be introduce to all levels in the pvp range starting at level 10
There will be a chance to win items at the completion of a battleground; similar to dungeons while leveling. WarcraftDevs 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
how important would you say math is to game design? or is it all done by computers now?
Math is very important to systems design. Most designers I work with are reasonably skilled at math, and some are experts. OccupyGStreet 
If you are building levels, narrative or maybe UI, math is less essential. Anything that involves combat is inherently numbers. OccupyGStreet 
I'd add that you're gonna need good, solid, time-tested vector math if you want anything moving on screen.
It depends how your studio divides design work and engineering work. Math is part of almost all engineering. OccupyGStreet 
If you're making UI and you want stuff moving around and feeling interactive, math looms ahead!
That may be. I designed a lot of UI for AoE and WoW and never used a calculator. I did for classes and items. OccupyGStreet
