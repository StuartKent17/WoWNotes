Azshara’s Eternal Palace

The Queen’s Court

Fixed an issue with Repeat Performance https://www.wowdb.com/spells/304409-repeat-performance where Ignore Pain triggered from Warriors’ Bastion of Might https://www.wowdb.com/spells/287377-bastion-of-might Azerite Trait was counted as a cast, causing them to be silenced if they used Ignore Pain after casting Avatar.

Queen Azshara

Overzealous Hulks should no longer be affected by snaring abilities or gain the Infuriated https://www.wowdb.com/spells/300428-infuriated buff from such abilities.

Developers’ note: Since Overzealous Hulks become immune upon the first expiration of a crowd-control ability, using a movement speed reduction effect on them was generally a trap, and sometimes unavoidable for players with uncontrollable snares tied to their rotational abilities.



Temple of Sethrallis

Removed a Void Emissary near the pack of enemies by Galvazzt.



Quests

Tauren players who completed their Heritage Armor quest line can now turn in “Remembrance” to Baine in Thunder Bluff.
"Show Me What You've Got https://www.wowdb.com/quests/48939-show-me-what-youve-got" is no longer required for the The Norwington Estate quest line in Tiragarde Sound.


WoW Classic

Fixed an issue where turning in the Head of Rend Blackhand for the quest “For the Horde!” was not granting the Warchief's Blessing buff to players in Orgrimmar.
