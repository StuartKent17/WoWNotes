Welcome once again to Artcraft! I’m Chris Robinson, art director of World of Warcraft. This Artcraft is another quick one, but still packed with goodies. Today we’re showing you our work on the male Draenei. The original was one of the better character models in the game, so it didn’t require a ton of translation—but with higher-resolution textures and more polygons to work with, we were able to bump up his fidelity quite a bit, as well as improve how we convey emotion through a new animation rig.

That’s all for now—thanks again for continuing to follow along as we develop these updated character models. See you next time!
