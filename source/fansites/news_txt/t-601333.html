A typical team will see a small change in their points, but players with very high or very low ratings will see a much larger change. Below is the new formula.<br>
<br>
If rating&lt;=1500 then<br>
Points=0.38*rating-194<br>
(note: this calculation can go negative, but will be floored at 0)<br>
<br>
If rating&gt;1500 then<br>
Points=1426.79/(1+918.836*Power(2.71828, -0.00386405*rating))<br>
<br>
So ... What does it mean ? High-rating Arena teams will loose points, a lot of points. (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=106864957&amp;pageNo=2&amp;sid=1#33) And you can check how many here (http://www.frals.net/wow/calc.php)<br>

The first graphic shows a comparison of how much points you get every week before and after the nerf. (The graphic was stolen from Curse-gaming.com (http://www-en.curse-gaming.com/articles/details/1998/) without even asking for their authorization)<br>

This one shows how much points you lose compared to the last version. (Posted on the official post by Zaleiria (http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Bonechewer&amp;n=Zaleiria))<br>
