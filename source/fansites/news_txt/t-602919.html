Bad news, I forgot to add two new WotLK screenshots to the news last week. Good news, I thought it would be a good idea to create a few WotLK pages on the site. Most of these screenshots/artworks/wallpapers are from the official site, the Blizzcon, and the Games Convention so don&apos;t expect tons of new things but you probably didn&apos;t see all of them. <br>

Illidan China first kill<br>
It&apos;s a bit late for first kill news, but this one is impressive. Burning Crusade was released in China on September 6th and yesterday a chinese guild called &quot;The Seven&quot; killed Illidan for the first time, that&apos;s about 7 weeks to clear Serpentshrine Cavern + Tempest Keep + Black Temple, not counting minor instances like Karazhan, Gruul&apos;s Lair and Magtheridon&apos;s Lair. That&apos;s probably the first killshot of Illidan with so many people still wearing their Tier 3 gear. <br>
