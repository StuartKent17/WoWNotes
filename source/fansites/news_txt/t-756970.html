Cataclysm Pets - Armadillo and Seagull<br>
2 Companion pets have been added to the game in the latest beta build, the Rutsberg Seagull (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/89472/) and the Armadillo (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/89670/). The texture on the armadillo seems to be a little low res but keep in mind that the pet is fairly small. <br>

LVL 85 Dungeons too hard?<br>
It&apos;s not quite that extreme. The problem currently is that some players are tackling Uldum or Twilight Highlands in level 83 gear, or worse, their LK epics (just had to throw that in there :) ). You will probably want a good mix of level 84 and 85 gear before doing the level 85 dungeons, and certainly the heroics. Eloderung says that he or she now has a decent mix of dungeon gear so the quest gear issue should be skewing things less. There are still overtuned or undertuned bosses and abilities for us to contend with though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725672943/lvl85-h-paladin-numbers-abilities-thread/))<br>

6% vs. 10% spellpower in Cataclysm<br>
The 10% spell power isn&apos;t offered by a ton of specs (nor are there any other specs that we want to add it to), but the buff makes a really big difference to casters. The 6% buff is there so we could make sure you weren&apos;t totally without any kind of buff if you lacked one of the 10% guys.

<br>
Mastery Stat<br>
Well, they are shiny and new and pretty much give you exactly what you want, so that response isn&apos;t too surprising. It&apos;s good that mastery is attractive and fun. We just don&apos;t want non-mastery gear to be viewed as junk the way some classes view some stats on Live.

Spamming the same spell<br>
Right. It&apos;s a skill curve thing. If there is a right time to use something and a big penalty for doing something at the wrong time, then there is a bigger difference between good and less good players. If you can pretty much do something whenever, then there is less to learn about your class, less to perfect and ultimately less reward in investing in understanding the character.

Holy Light / Flash of Light spamming<br>
We just don&apos;t agree that it worked. What generally happened was either the set bonuses, glyphs and librams all aligned to make either Flash of Light the best spell or Holy Light. In rare cases we got lucky and paladins could choose to gear either for a FoL or HL spam, but they were still choosing one spell over the other. They really weren&apos;t using a particular spell for a particular job, so the toolbox felt small and they were hitting the same buttons all the time.<br>
<br>
I can almost promise you that a Holy paladin in Cataclysm will use Holy Shock, Word of Glory, Flash of Light, Holy Light, Divine Light, Holy Radiance and Light of Dawn on every challenging dungeon or raid run. That sounds a lot more fun than spamming Holy Light with the occasional Holy Shock on cooldown. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726014169/paladin-holy-changes-in-cataclysm/))<br>
<br>
Mana costs<br>
Mana needs to matter more. Ret (and Prot) generally need to be able to hit all of &quot;their&quot; buttons without being resource constrained, but then should only have enough mana to situationally use things like Holy Light, Exorcism or (untalented) Consecrate.<br>
<br>
It&apos;s fine to cast one Exorcism at range to pull or something, but it&apos;s not something we generally want you doing outside of Art of War procs. We&apos;re pretty reluctant to put a cooldown back on the spell though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725723300/feedback-paladin/))<br>
<br>
AE Healing<br>
We just don&apos;t believe the healing situation and the AE healing situation in particular is as dire as many of you are suggesting. We balance the encounters around the class capabilities, so if many groups are struggling on certain ones, those will be adjusted accordingly. We generally don&apos;t give classes new abilities because they have trouble on certain fights. If you&apos;re finding that you are just constantly behind the curve on every encounter, even the trash, then you are probably doing something wrong (attempting these dungeons undergeared is something we are seeing a lot) or your class has some kind of systemic bug that is affecting all of the healing you do.<br>
<br>
Overall, the dungeons probably will end up more challenging than they were in Lich King. Even if we eventually end up with 10 minute chain pulling 5-player dungeons in Deathwing gear, there is no need to start out that way.

<br>
Holy Mastery<br>
Incidentally, we looked at mastery for Holy paladins today and decided we were happy, for now, with the power it offers, so reforge away if you think that makes you more powerful. We might always tweak things in the future. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725672943/lvl85-h-paladin-numbers-abilities-thread/))<br>
<br>
Changing Light of Dawn to only use Holy Power<br>
We thought about a similar implementation a lot, but just worried that would make Light of Dawn harder to use. With a long cooldown, you at least can save it until you think you need it. Sitting on 3 Holy Power (and being unable to use Word of Glory during that time) might be brutal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725672943/lvl85-h-paladin-numbers-abilities-thread/))<br>
<br>
Haste/Crit/Overhealing in Cataclysm<br>
That&apos;s an interesting perspective. Typically LK paladins tell us that they like haste because it lets them get a heal out *right now* before a tank dies, but don&apos;t like crit because it often overheals. To use a tired cliche, it did feel a lot like Whack-a-mole because you needed to heal ASAP but how hard you healed someone wasn&apos;t nearly as important. FoL could often bring someone to full and a HL crit would be tons of overhealing. (I am talking only about the stats in how they affect healing per se, not extra effects like Illumination.) In Cataclysm you won&apos;t overheal as much (making the free healing from crits more useful) but you won&apos;t be in constant fear of the tank dying in one GCD (making haste less useful).

Secondary effect on Heroic Leap<br>
Adding a secondary effect to Heroic Leap, like a Thunder Clap or letting you get out of roots might be a good role for a glyph. We don&apos;t like to glyph new high level abilities immediately because then players don&apos;t appreciate what the glyph does for them, since they have never used the ability unglyphed. It&apos;s something we could consider for a future patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560867318/new-warrior-discussion-build-12857/))</div></div>
