Patch 4.3.2: Trading Card Game Items<br>
The three new items were added in Patch 4.3.2 are found on the TCG Loot vendor in Booty Bay. They are part of the Timewalkers: War of the Ancients expansion. (Feldrake (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79771/feldrake/), Eye of the Legion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79744/eye-of-the-legion/), and Demon Hunter&apos;s Aspect (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79769/demon-hunters-aspect/))<br>

Italian Localization<br>
Mentions of an Italian localization popped up in the Patch 4.3.2 files, but the actual localization is not in game yet. This does not confirm for sure that the Italian localization will be added, just hints that it might be. Let&apos;s just wait to see if there is anything official about it in the future before getting excited. <br>

4.3.2 PTR and New File Optimization Tech<br>
With the 4.3.2 patch we&#x2019;ll be testing some new file optimization tech. As you may be aware, with previous major expansion patches (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, etc.) we&#x2019;ve carried out a time-consuming process to reorganize the game files currently installed on your hard drive to integrate all previous patch files, essentially &#x2018;cleaning up&#x2019; what&#x2019;s on your computer and reducing the full installation size. This process used to require an amount of free hard drive space double that of the entire installation size to complete, which is why we&#x2019;ve reserved them for large expansion-sized patches.<br>
<br>
The new tech we&#x2019;re testing with the 4.3.2 PTR will process these cleanups with no additional hard drive space required beyond what the patch is adding. Because of that you may see them appear more frequently with patches.<br>
<br>
While the cleanup is occurring you&#x2019;ll see a specific message on the launcher informing you the process is currently taking place. If you encounter any issues with the new process please be sure to visit our support site at http://www.battle.net/support/<br>

LFR Loot Rules<br>
We know this information. The item designers have plenty of spreadsheets too. If you&apos;re saying creating said spreadsheet takes an equivalent amount of time as coding a system in the game whereby item distribution accounts for the spec you&apos;re fulfilling in a dungeon, you&apos;re wrong. <br>
<br>
We&apos;re not that naive. We knew from the start of designing the Raid Finder system that we&apos;d need to build a smarter loot distribution system to regulate fair play. It was also really important to us to get Raid Finder working and implemented with the Dragon Soul raid. We had to be realists about it. <br>
<br>
The loot system will be improved in upcoming updates -- including in patch 4.3.2, where it&apos;ll no longer be possible to win two of the same item for a single boss kill. But we&apos;re really happy with the implementation of Raid Finder and feel it&apos;s a great new feature for the game, and one we&apos;ll continue refining over time. <br>
<br>
Money isn&apos;t nearly the overarching, limiting factor people love to claim it is. And the common argument I see in response to the above quote is &quot;hire more people then.&quot; But I think it&apos;s pretty easy to understand that looking for the perfect fit for a position is not always a quick process, nor is the training of new employees. This is particularly true when one is speaking about development studios generating creative media. Expertise, design philosophy, synergy, etc. are very important to the success of a project, not sheer headcount.<br>
<br>
Our development teams are quite modest in size compared to a lot of studios, but it&apos;s because we genuinely feel it&apos;s not always good to have so many hands on a project. If that means we have to make tough decisions about how and when to release a product or feature, so be it.<br>
<br>
That said, we do still have plenty of positions (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/index.html) we&apos;re looking to fill.

Gurthalak, Voice of the Deeps Balance Issues<br>
There are several things that we want to follow-up on and clarify:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We noticed Retribution DPS was higher than we expected. We investigated and realized Gurthalak was the cause. We further realized (and several players independently discovered) that the weapon proc was activating twice as often for Retribution as intended.<br>
Retribution was getting more than twice as many proc chances than we intended. This was caused by the application of Censure, not the dot itself ticking.<br>
This was not an accidental bug fix of some sort. The proc was happening more often than we expected and desired, leading to damage higher than we expected and desired, so we took steps to fix it.<br>
We changed the duration of Gurthalak&#x2019;s proc some time ago. The 4.3.2 tooltip change simply acknowledges this fix. The weapon&#x2019;s damage should not change in 4.3.2.<br>
Gurthalak is still a fantastic weapon for Retribution paladins and any other two-handed DPS plate-wearers. The average DPS reduction is lower than the 10% figure some have quoted. The sword&#x2019;s damage can be quite variable, and there are isolated cases where it may have briefly contributed 20% or more of someone&#x2019;s damage, but those are statistical outliers.<br>
Being nerfed is never fun. We get that. The increased proc chance was our mistake, as always, and we apologize for not catching it sooner. Retribution paladin damage for players without Gurthalak is where we intended it to be. We expect Retribution damage with this change to also end up where we intend it to be. If damage falls unacceptably low for some reason, we will certainly consider taking additional measures.<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, thank you very much for all of the useful feedback. We pay close attention to these things. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/215382-gurth-far-more-broken-in-pvp-pve-than-dwtr/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3811455871?page=19#372)) <br>
