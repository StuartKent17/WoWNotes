Azeroth Choppers: Ask the Bike Experts<br>
For those of you keeping up with Azeroth Choppers, we recently introduced you to the Alliance and Horde teams here at Blizzard (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/13880482). Now we&apos;d like to give you the opportunity to get to know the handpicked teams of bike experts that are bringing to life a pair of asphalt-kicking, World of Warcraft-inspired chopper designs.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions for Paul Jr. and his crew about bike designs/fabrication, working with Horde and Alliance themes, the trials and tribulations they&apos;ve faced in recent Azeroth Choppers episodes, or anything else along those lines, please share them here. Feel free to target your questions toward a specific team or individual designer too.<br>
<br>
We&apos;ll be selecting interesting questions from the community and seeking out answers from the bike experts of teams Alliance and Horde over at Paul Jr. Designs.<br>
<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
Classes<br>
Interested in the filtering of spell visuals. Will all major defensive and offensive CDs remain visible e.g. dark soul, pain sup<br>
Pain Sup yes. Dark Soul, usually. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463107337259986945))<br>
<br>
Question: Now that Vengeance is being separated from DPS, will AoE Vengeance DR continue to stay as Resolve or be reverted?<br>
Undecided yet. The reason we put it in does still stay valid. (Many little hits are less threatening than few big hits.) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463421154510647296))<br>
<br>
Will it be possible to turn off the spell culling? If you have a computer than can handle it you should be able to.<br>
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463799638990925824))<br>
<br>
What are some offensive/defensive cooldowns that you think have easy to read visuals? What ones get lost in the noise? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463005497067446273))<br>
Shaman Ascendance is too flashy. Everyone can see it from a mile away, and your burst turns out to be worthless<br>
Actually, Ascendance is a great example of a cooldown with a spell effect that perfectly matches its significance. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463761378449178625))<br>
Perhaps, and it might just be me comparing things to other burst - example, Tiger Eye Brew, which is hard to notice, in comparison<br>
The fix here is to make make Tiger Eye Brew easier to read, not make Ascendance more obscure. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463762937182957568))<br>

How will Necrotic Plague interact with things like Chilblains?<br>
It will apply Chillblains. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463376219698778112))<br>
Think the question is does stack increase apply the slow again or nplague actually make it harder to apply again<br>
Ah, yes, it would apply Chillblains. Nothing to worry about there. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463400151617241088))<br>

Insuring I understand, Hunters designed for mobility fights. Standard single target always intended to be low DPS? Seems unfair.<br>
Raid bosses aren&apos;t static target dummies; neither are enemy players. We balance classes for real PvE and PvP situations. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463126063951130624))<br>

Please explain why you are nerfing Touch of Karma in WoD ? <br>
We aren&apos;t. Touch of Karma is remaining exactly as strong as it was before. We just didn&apos;t double it along with player health. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/462720371326607360))<br>
Thx for the answear but you are nerfing TOK : it is reduced by 50% when other % health heals and absorbs are reduced by 25% !<br>
You&apos;re looking at it as an absorb. We don&apos;t see it that way; we see it as a damage ability that happens to absorb too. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/462859863689682944))<br>

And Ret needs something Holy doesn&apos;t bring for RBG, cool, scalable for big groups and reliable. Like Solar, Grip, Knockback... <br>
Wary of adding a lot of unique utility to specific specs as we&apos;ve seen how that has gone with PvE raid compositions. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463784135568261120))<br>

Current Mastery levels give so many vt ticks so it we never can run oom when 2+ vts are up. This and SFiend regen is gone in WoD<br>
I think I already answer that concern. Mana will be a limitation on healing done, not on damage done. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463548238830645248))<br>

locks were never true tanks and would require them to rework a spec for the sake of an optional talent 2/2<br>
Yep. Changes required to make Prot a real DPS are trivial compared to what&apos;s required to make Demo a real tank. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/462654490462535680))<br>

Sorry if you&apos;ve already answered this elsewhere, but what made you guys decide that Prot. Warrior dps should be in the game?<br>
A) Sword+Board DPS is a strong fantasy that a lot of players are interested in. B) Required minimal changes to make. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/462653768308236288))<br>
Ultimately, it&apos;s an experiment, not a guarantee that we&apos;re going to go forward with it, or spread to all tanks. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/462653924072501248))<br>
<br>
In order of impact: CSmash glyph, Ignite Weapon, ZRage, ZStance, Shouts. Rage going the way of DPS caster mana? Boring<br>
I think you may be confusing some customization options for mandatory gameplay changes. ZerkRage/Shouts changes raise the skill cap. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463398722802434048))<br>
Yes but are you gonna be rewarded for sticking to the more complex rotations?<br>
Yes, but additionally I&apos;d point out that Ignite Weapon is actually a more complex rotation. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463401150356525056))<br>
<br>
Is bladed armor gear expected to be sub-par to dps stat gear?<br>
No, above par. Bonus Armor will be your most valuable secondary stat as a Gladiator. (ie, same as Defensive Protection) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463793998960664576))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
So when 6.0 hits, will any heroic Siege gear be made into Mythic gear?<br>
Yes - no change in item level or anything, just the green label to avoid confusion. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463719209671749632))<br>
<br>
Achievements<br>
Will there be realmfirst achievements for reputation &amp; challengemode like in MoP or are they also gone?<br>
We&apos;ll likely keep those. The race to max level in particular is what encouraged and rewarded use of borderline exploits. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462379777672765440))<br>
Uhh the rep is just as toxic as the level rush lol might want to rethink that one.<br>
I&apos;m just speaking in general terms. That sort of rep achievement may not make sense at all in Warlords. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462409495109304320))<br>
<br>
with change coming to UBRS, will we still be able to achieve Leeeeeeeeeeeroy! after WoD drops?<br>
That&apos;s a good question, not currently, but we will look into an alternative way for you to aggro 200 whelps (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/463520220691587072))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
I&apos;m hearing that I can go straight from LFG stuff to CM to Mythic and that excites me greatly.Right now you can zone in on Heroic if you find someone with a Normal clear; we&apos;re just removing that hurdle. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462641736615882752))<br>
I would not recommend trying Mythic raiding without any raid gear, but you CAN try it. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462641525152022528))<br>
<br>
So some might still want to reach max level and preraid BiS in the first week the expansion launches right, like older launches?<br>
Of course, competitive players will seek every advantage - I wouldn&apos;t expect anything else. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462648153691676674))<br>
<br>
So CM rewards NOT &gt;/= Normal Raid Gear? As I understood, they were between Normal/Heroic Raid ilvl?<br>
No, CM rewards roughly equal to Raid Finder loot. Imagine 476 epics in 5.0, for a more direct analogy. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462642344698073088))<br>
<br>
I&apos;m still bitter that heirlooms have been gated behind a raid boss. Many altaholics don&apos;t raid. Just quest and explore<br>
Don&apos;t think of these as true heirlooms, but as raid loot that stays useful to 100. We&apos;ll add real 90+ heirlooms in the future. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462643353151373312))<br>
<br>
Also I often hear: &quot;Oh, crap let me go get my seals&quot; in the middle of my raid. New system means they just go without.<br>
Yeah, we&apos;re still working through a solve for that. Agree it&apos;s problematic if you have to do it all pre-raid each week. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462647038837272577))<br>
<br>
Why not make bonus roll tokens stay like they are now, where you buy up to 3/week with an uncapped currency?<br>
We&apos;ll have more details to share on the specifics in the future - but that&apos;s more or less how it&apos;ll work. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462693576720121856))<br>
<br>
Getting a seal through garrisons officially makes the feature a chore for people who just want to raid.<br>
Pretty sure you&apos;re misunderstanding. You&apos;ll probably turn stuff in to get your bonus rolls at your garrison. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462690720609218560))<br>
That&apos;s not the same as &quot;doing garrisons&quot; to earn them. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462690924381085696))<br>
Plz make sure we can get all tokens for the week on Tuesday, the wording in the interview worried me.<br>
We will. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462708465371451393))<br>
<br>
Will we have more than 3 choices for our 3 seal quests? What if our garrison is under attack? That makes for a horrid Tues.<br>
We&apos;re going to be very mindful of all those quality-of-life concerns. The goal here is more freedom, not less. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462674657595101185))<br>
No offense, but it doesn&apos;t feel that way. Feels inescapable treadmill + 3 long tasks for Tues on top of world boss before raid.<br>
Right, I mean that we&apos;re not going to design the system such that you have to do all of that on Tuesday before you raid. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462676664242409472))<br>
<br>
that&apos;s what I like about the current system too. Nice to stockpile charms to have some &apos;time off&apos; in future weeks<br>
Exactly - we want to preserve that flexibility. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462701014454652928))<br>
<br>
Any plans to change heirlooms that become useless? Spirit mace for a spriest was my &quot;spec&quot; drop?<br>
Yeah, Spirit on those weapons is being replaced since we know it has no effect for hybrid nukers. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462680401925124096))<br>
<br>
Are we going to see anything with normal raid lvl loot out of raid in WoD? Past had valor, craftable... now tuned to LFR?<br>
There will be a bunch of systems (garrisons, crafting, outdoor content, etc.) that can yield items on par with Normal raid loot (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462811512290443264))<br>
WoD normal AKA Flex? In MoP craft/outdoor is normal AKA WoD heroic level gear. Is this nerf to craft?<br>
...and some Heroic stuff at the high end. We&apos;re not nerfing those systems. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462974659307511808))<br>
<br>
Please confirm that there will be no more cut scenes like after Council in ToT, unskippable.<br>
These are the hard-hitting questions that matter. Yes, there will not be any more unskippable scenes like that. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463037490082111489))<br>
<br>
Will we ever see a boss again even the best guilds can&apos;t beat for over a month? Is it still possible? eg Kael Yogg 0 H Lich King<br>
Yogg-0 is valid, but it was viewed as a bonus and few were trying until Stars did it. Top guilds are pretty amazing nowadays. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463152137296678914))<br>
Kael was pretty much unkillable in 2.0; fixed in 2.1 and died shortly after. H-LK had limited attempts. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463151995298529280))<br>
<br>
Did Garrosh HC with 1 tank 1 healer, it&apos;s unfortunate that this is possible; could you please make the debuff not reset on whirl<br>
Agree that it&apos;s unfortunate, but we&apos;re not going to make any changes that make the fight harder at this point. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463186175147393024))<br>
<br>
Raid Finder and Heroic Dungeons<br>
New proposed LFR is very sad. It&apos;s really making me wish I never preordered WoD. Commit to a schedule or no tiered sets. Thanks.<br>
With Group Finder you should be able to do Normal without any fixed schedule - that&apos;s an essential goal for us. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462975077810966528))<br>
<br>
Why will heroic 5 mans be harder than LFR yet give worse gear?<br>
LFR entails a larger time commitment, has a weekly lockout, and requires more people, even if lower personal responsibility. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463174509001195520))<br>
This doesn&apos;t feel like it&apos;s solving the &quot;LFR required&quot; problem that&apos;s been persistent through MOP :\<br>
Required for what, exactly? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463340298903781376))<br>
<br>
alts also have zero option besides LFR, mains had it the best with that - if you kept up every tier<br>
There will be a number of options for alts. If you really don&apos;t want to touch LFR, you won&apos;t have to. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463344495254568961))<br>
If you&apos;re hoping for it to be completely irrelevant under all circumstances, then sorry, that&apos;s not happening. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463344587759976448))<br>
<br>
That line about it&apos;s been difficult to look at a players gear &amp; tell how awesome they are with shared art..So, LFR=Crap player?<br>
No, but clearly less time investment and _proven_ skill than a Mythic raider, no? Same for Gladiator vs. someone w/ BG Honor gear. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462779056166301696))<br>
I can&apos;t believe I even defended this change as compromise. This LFR change is _proven_ as stroking the epeens of snowflakes.<br>
The other side of this is improving the LFR experience (which we need to do), and significantly increasing loot yield. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462797327275941890))<br>
Increasing loot yield=LFR players not interested in stepping up unsubbing sooner once they have all their gear. Sound business?<br>
Honestly, I&apos;d rather someone take a break until new content rather than leave frustrated after grinding for loot that doesn&apos;t drop (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462798735362506752))<br>
But of course we want to offer diverse content to appeal to players, that isn&apos;t tied to just ticking off a list of raid drops. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462798879730454528))<br>
There you go LFR people, if you&apos;re not interested in stepping up Blizzard are happy to see you unsubscribe, you have your answer<br>
If that&apos;s what you got out of my reply, then I&apos;m not sure where to go from there, sorry. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462800085428883456))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
full geared one. if everyone was close to the same ilvl it would make more sense, better for competition instead of getting rolled<br>
In Warlords we&apos;ll be increasing everyone&apos;s ilevel to a minimum point and dual ilevel let&apos;s us contract the spread a bit. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/462417038753796096))<br>
<br>
any plans to give treants a pet bar its annoying when someone ccs out of a root beam and the treant breaks it?<br>
Not really. They are breaking with their wrath? What types of CC? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/462479651609124865))<br>
<br>
.so skirmishes are back (yay!) but also for low level?<br>
yes low level too! (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/462636808157659137))<br>
<br>
i&apos;ve read that skirmishes will work with MMR, but their goal isn&apos;t to meet random-level people ? Tell me more please.<br>
They&apos;ll have a minimum level of MMR for reasonable matchmaking, but the search will broaden aggressively to reduce queue times. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463504144376934401))<br>
<br>
I would say the pvp enchants have been a huge success in terms of appeal. Any chance wod will have them as well?<br>
Agree they were popular and we&apos;d like to do them again (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/462709283428110337))<br>
<br>
can you put cross realm bgs into skirmish in WoD so guilds or rbg teams can challenge guilds on other severs plz<br>
Yes everything will be cross realm (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/462744617876611072))<br>
think he meant wargames?not sure.<br>
Same answer (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/462819845197676546))<br>
<br>
My only concern with spectator mode is arena/rbg coaches. Spectator keeps an eye out for important things the players may miss.<br>
Spectator mode is only available for pre-arranged matches via War Games. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463062712671412225))<br>
<br>
With the changes 2 PvP coming in WoD, how are you going 2 balance 2 and 4pc PvE gear to work in PvP situations? Dont want it 2 OP.<br>
typically PvP set bonuses couldn&apos;t benefit throughput but now they can compete with PvE ones. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463092699520696320))<br>
<br>
Will we be getting new &amp; interesting PvP set bonuses? If so will they change each season or stay the same for the xpac?<br>
Definitely new set bonuses to start the expansion. Every season could be interesting way to create flame wars each season (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463371141646540800))<br>
<br>
Short version: Less reliance on color shifts. The more awesome you are, the more awesome you look. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/462661366516441088))<br>
what of armor sets kind of progressed. How LK naxx gear was kind of an upgrade to vanilla naxx.<br>
the elite and mythic sets will have various additions compared to the normal raid/conquest gear. Feels like an evolution. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/462750562526588928))<br>
are they just cosmetic(elite PVP gear) or is there finnaly a real power reward for higher rating?<br>
Cosmetic. We don&apos;t like attaching power to rating. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463100233019187200))<br>
<br>
PvEers have a huge pool of gear to try and make a min-max set. PvPers only get one p/spec. Could we get more options pleeease? <br>
Yes we&apos;d like to find ways to get more variety in the PvP gear. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463741736666140672))<br>
<br>
Will there be different ways of obtaining cutting edge PvP gear other than via arena grind in WoD?<br>
Conquest gear will still come from doing Rated PvP, which we consider the toughest challenge players can face in WoW PvP. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463763261729431552))<br>
with the arena and rbg caps being equal couldn&apos;t you cap conq thru randoms? Or no more RanBG conq?<br>
Yes you could, but it is very inefficient to do so. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463784218888134656))<br>
<br>
I&apos;m not sure PvP gear needs &gt; Mythic gear in WPvP. Time and effort to obtain much greater. Should probably equal PvP gear instead.<br>
The difference in ilevel between Conquest gear and Mythic gear will be quite minimal (maybe 5 ilevels). (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463784733076226048))<br>
<br>
important pvp cast animations on opponent maintained I hope?<br>
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463794081882062848))<br>
<br>
Ok, serious quesiton: How do I win a random BG or CTA that is not IoC or AV as alliance? Is it mandatory to find a premade now?<br>
I&apos;ve been winning EotS all weekend on my Alliance toons without a group. Not sure what to tell you. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463137430527152128))<br>
<br>
Best fun I had in game was in a tBC twink guildWent to Gurubashi on PTR to duelIs WoD PvP going to be a capture of twink culture?<br>
We&apos;re not making any special efforts towards twinks in Warlords (but we didn&apos;t specifically do things for twinks back then). (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463507443738112001))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
Personally hate garrison idea. How inconvenient will it be to avoid them? Looks difficult to level etc without them.<br>
What do you hate about it? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463151672513265664))<br>
followers, profession buildings, customization, quests... Basically everything we&apos;ve been told.<br>
If you want no part of the garrison &quot;minigame&quot; (followers, upgrades, etc.) you can certainly opt out. Can&apos;t opt out of having one. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463158515247620096))<br>
but how much more difficult will it make things?<br>
Hard to quantify, but we&apos;re trying to make the system a bonus. We&apos;ll have lots more info soon (actual soon, not &quot;Soon(TM)&quot;). (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463170092696862720))<br>
<br>
Can you trigger a garrison attack? If not how often can they be?<br>
Still working out the details, feels fun when groups you&apos;ve been killing counterattack, also feels fun when more random (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/463363735210295296))<br>
<br>
Can we invite other ppl to our Garrisons? I mean this is suppose to be Wow&apos;s version of housing so thats one of the point to me.<br>
Yes! We&apos;re trying to make as much garrison content support multiplayer as possible (invasions, random events, etc.) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/463520010649235457))<br>
<br>
(Will Garrisons cost an absurd amount of money? Because my WoW toons are all poor.)<br>
Not currently, if you missed some plans by exploring the world, you can purchase them outright, but that&apos;s about it (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/463712966492561408))<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor<br>
The blizz forum post about 6.0 wasnt the advanced notice right? Like blizz will still give us a few weeks to get ready for 6.0?<br>
Right, no dates yet. Just giving ample advance notice so players can plan accordingly. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463500333302706177))<br>
