Legion - Character Leveling Stats<br>
Today we are taking a look at the percentage of characters of each class that made it from being Level 100 a few months before Legion to Level 110 as of this week.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some characters were lost to name changes, realm transfers, faction changes, and database issues.<br>
The absolute percentages here have little meaning because of those issues, so they should only be used for comparing one class to another.<br>
Demon Hunters were not included, as the set of characters being checked was from a few months before the pre-expansion patch.<br>
We did the same thing during Mists of Pandaria (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3383-Character-Leveling-Stats-New-Video-Game-and-WoW-Forums-Blue-Tweets-Blizzard-Art) and Cataclysm (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2413-Character-Activity-Stats-Poll-Trip-to-Blizzcon-Contest-MMO-Report). Keep in mind that both of those were later into the expansion. <br>

Blue Tweets<br>
BlizzCon<br>
One of the cool things about a content-heavy patch cycle is that there is always fun stuff to talk about at Blizzcon (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/782964181028921345))<br>
<br>
Future Content<br>
At this point in your Legion progression, what sort of content would you most like to see added? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/782962079707729920))<br>
Brawlers guild with new bosses, legion spaceship I can use to explore the universe and planets to conquer with my followers<br>
you sound EXACTLY like Sargeras right now (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/782964331122036736))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Seeing the post on reddit in which you basically say that LFR is the worst design decision you&apos;ve ever made, I&apos;m wondering what was the idea/mindset behind making it? To allow people who aren&apos;t that good at the game to experience raiding?<br>
Yeah I expanded a little in that answer. I said that the goal of getting players with less time or willingness to wipe for 3 hours into raiding was a noble goal. Raiding is fun. It&apos;s the most epic part of the game IMHO. A lot of storytelling happens in raids and you get to see some great art and interact with famous characters. We definitely spent a lot of dev time on raiding, so getting it accessible to a larger population made sense.<br>
<br>
The problem with Raid Finder was that when the content was too tough (meaning easier than normal raiding, but not a cake walk) then people would tend to drop the raid after a wipe or two. You&apos;d get these revolving doors where the raid itself was stuck on a boss but the individuals in the raid had cycled through maybe 100s of players after a few hours. There was no &quot;Okay, boys and girls, let&apos;s call it a night,&quot; moment that you get from a raid leader in an organized guild. For that matter, there was no leader who could kick problem players, dictate strategy or explain the fights. For most players, Raid Finder was a weirdly silent and anonymous affair.<br>
<br>
The altenative was to make the difficulty level so easy that you&apos;d probably steamroll every boss and that&apos;s sort of where we ended up, but it meant you weren&apos;t really doing a rotation, lots of people were AFK and these famous bosses hit like kittens.<br>
<br>
Daelo (Scott Mercer) was the other designer who worked with me on Raid Finder, and if I had to do it all over again, I think I would advocate we try something more like a group builder where a leader would invite (and be able to kick) people. I did a lot of pug raiding over the years, and some of them worked fine, which leads me to believe that model has promise. I *think* WoW has something like that now? Not sure.<br>
<br>
I have a lot of faith in those guys. They will eventually figure out a good solution if they haven&apos;t already. The original question and answer were both targeting my career as a designer, not an attempt to take a shot at WoW.<br>
