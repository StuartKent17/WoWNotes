A few hours ago, Vanquish (http://vanquish-guild.com/main/) (US-Staghelm) managed to take down all 3 bosses of the Vault of Archavon within one minute and was the first guild in the world to complete the Earth, Wind &amp; Fire (10 Player) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4016/earth-wind-fire-10-player/) achievement. Congratulations to them!<br>
