Boubouille2010-12-21, 09:13 AMUpdate - Added a very important rule to the contest.

New content only - I have absolutely no way to check if you're the original author of a guide if you already posted it somewhere else. People caught cheating by stealing other people's work on other sites will be permanently banned from the forums. 


MMO-Champion Guide Contest - Win a Mottled Drake and a Riding Turtle!
After the ridiculously popular Facebook giveaways during the week-end, I came to the conclusion that my users like free stuff and I decided to kick it up a notch with a contest.

Your guide

The only thing you have to do is to write the best guide you can! It can be anything, raid guide, auction house guide, profession guide, class guides, addons configuration guide, guide on how to make your level 1 alt look awesome, guide on how to tweak and optimize WoW, etc ... The possibilities are endless.
Picking something original is nice, but keep in mind that the main purpose of a guide is to be helpful. Also keep in mind that it has to be related to WoW!!! 
I think any kind of content is allowed as long as it can go on the main page. Pictures will make anything better and I strongly suggest that you use them and don't rush them on paint but you can totally expand to videos or HTML/Javascript keep it simple, please
If you plan to use HTML/Javascript you will have to host that part of your guide on your own site, I won't let you embed it on the forums for very obvious security reasons. 
If you need to upload images, use imgur.com http://imgur.com/, they're nice. 


Contest Rules

The contest starts as soon as this news post goes up and will end on Tuesday 28th December at 08:00PM GMT. 
Your guide has to be posted in the Guide Submission Forum http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/321-Guide-Submission. One entry per person.
New content only - I have absolutely no way to check if you're the original author of a guide if you already posted it somewhere else. People caught cheating by stealing other people's work on other sites will be permanently banned from the forums. 
You are free to edit the content of your guide until the end of the contest, on Tuesday 28th December at 08:00PM GMT the forums will be locked and all the guides there will be reviewed. 
Other forum users can not see your guide and will not steal your ideas. To prevent any drama the guides are also hidden for moderators and global moderators and the only people who can see them are the Administrators who aren't allowed to participate, obviously.
The winners are the people who come up with the best guide. They will be announced shortly after the end of the contest and the winning guides will be published on the front page over the next few days. 
After all the winners have been announced and their guides published on the front page, the guides submission forum will become public and users will be free to check any of the guide submitted during the contest.


Good luck!

Cataclysm Hotfixes - Updated Dec. 20
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. While many have already been deployed on all realms, some may not be implemented until the next time your realm is restarted. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.

Cobra Shot is no longer refreshing the duration of the Wyvern Sting damage-over-time effect. Cobra Shot is correctly extending the damage-over-time effect applied by Serpent Sting.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage / Cataclysm Talent Calculator http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..mage / Beta Skills/Talents http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1669-Mage-Cataclysm

Conjuring refreshments no longer count toward achievements like Set the Oven to "Cataclysmic" and Time To Open A Restaurant.
Impact is no longer applying damage-over-time effects to enemy targets who are not within line-of-sight of the original target. A target in line-of-sight with the original target is still affected appropriately, even if they are not in sight of the mage.

Chakra is no longer consumed by a Prayer of Mending bounce.
Guardian Spirit's capped value did not rise properly from level 80-85. This has been corrected.


Dungeons & Raids

Lava Surgers present in several dungeons now have loot and can be mined.


Bastion of Twilight

Cho'gall's Worshipping effect can now correctly be interrupted with stuns and other interrupt abilities.
Valiona will now prioritize taking flight and interrupt Devouring Flames if it's cast during a transition.

Quests for Grim Batol are now appropriately flagged as dungeon quests.


Halls of Origination

Players are now able to zone into the dungeon if Anraphet is in combat.


Lost City of the Tol'vir

The Lockmaw encounter no longer resets if a Frenzied Crocolisk Evades.
Players are now able to zone into the dungeon if General Hussam is in combat.

Items

The buff from Corrupted Egg Shell will no longer absorb more than its intended amount.
Winged Steed of the Ebon Blade is no longer showing as available for purchase by any class but death knights.
Several shirts have been corrected so they no longer cause a player's item level to increase. They are item level 1.


Professions

The search radius to find an Archaeology node from the Archaeology ability Survey has been increased. This will result in fewer searches needed while in the "green" range of surveying.
The Alchemy specialization Elixir Master was granting extra potion procs instead of Potion Master when used on Cataclysm level recipes. The potions found to be causing this have been fixed.
Both Willful Ember Topaz and Lucent Ember Topaz no longer award skill past 515 Jewelcrafting skill. The designs still show as grey in the Profession window, but no longer award skill up to 525.
Several cooking recipes were not counting toward the achievement Set the Oven to "Cataclysmic" and have been updated. Note that Darkbrew Lager, Highland Spirits, and Chocolate Cookie are not intended to count for this achievement.
