Patch 6.2 - Updated Demon Models
Patch 6.2 finally updates many of the old demon models. Warlocks only use the new Doomguard model and the rest of their pets are still the old demon models.

Flying Feedback
"Didn't listen" doesn't = "didn't implement." Designing is a group activity, what I want may not matter in the end, but I read your post. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/602731018454474753
I think it's a slight misnomer and most are looking for discussion. Only implementing and saying why feels a bit dismissive.
Understood. While I can't offer much for discussion, hopefully it's a small comfort that at least their posts are read/voices heard. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/602735326927421440

Mr. Feasel, ask yourself why you disagree that much with many of your players. Do you still think you adress them?
I may not disagree with you at all. I don't make all of the decisions Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/602738898515689472

Thanks again for the continued feedback. Still here, still listening, Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/602725757471821825
"Thanks for the feedback" is becoming the wowdev version of "umadbro"
If I didn't want people to continue providing feedback, I wouldn't have posted anything at all Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/602726643757625344
feedback is useful with two-sided communication, and you as a team are still too quiet
I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I think it's important to note that I'm reading all of the responses. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/602729337847160832
Would be nice to get the actual reasoning behind decisions instead of snark. A good start is "I'll mention it next meeting."
I never take a piece of feedback lightly. Every Voice Matters. However, I can't talk about internal goings-on. Apologies. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/602732501807804416
Sometimes seeing "I hear everything" feels impersonal. Maybe see if you can get a public facing response to some "no" decisions? 
Usually the next product or patch addresses issues, we live in interesting times with instant communication. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/602734665657688064

If you're going to announce a major feature being removed indefinitely, an interview isn't the place. Perhaps the main website?
Curious why you feel that way. An interview on a major press site will likely be seen by more players. CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/602219738681475072

you realize most of the post has turned into just flaming you guys because months of real feedback was ignored right?
There is a massive difference between "ignored" and "disagreed with." CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/602271343850184704

Selfie Contest Confusion
Hello! Yes we've been working on this for the last few hours after running into an issue with the page not resetting people's entries for the new week. As a solution we're going to be creating a new weekly entry page for each week's challenge that will be specifically for that week. When a new week is available it'll be a new page. To help make that easy for you we're going to constantly update the blizz.ly URL we've been using to always point to the current week's entry page: http://blizz.ly/WoWSelfie 

If you did clear your browser and already entered don't worry, your entry is saved, but if you'd like to enter again on the new page there's no penalty, we'll just delete the duplicate. We'll be closing what will be the 'week 1 page' here shortly.

Thanks for your patience, and good luck! Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/374327-selfie-contest-confusion/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17605531516?page=1#12

Iron Man Challenge Stats
I have a few convoluted ways of detecting whether a character has equipped certain restricted gear for the Iron Man challenge, however, I would love to be able to just look at their statistics at a character level
Done. Check out the next PTR build - there should be visible character-specific statistics available to track this information. Official Forums http://us.battle.net/en/forum/topic/17532853244#2


Vanilla Servers
I would come back to wow in a heartbeat if blizz made vanilla servers. I would love to experience it all again. By the way I don't mean this as a knock to current WOW, it's just something I would find incredibly fun.
I think the biggest challenges for an idea like this are a would it be interesting enough to keep playing, and b would there be enough sustained interest from other players to make the world feel alive. I could easily see the outcome being people logging in, going "wow the game is so much better now," and logging out. CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/601498462488768512
IMO seeing how popular uh "theoretical" vanilla servers seem to be, I would say there is at least some demand.
Sure, there's definitely interest, even internally. We just don't think there's enough to offset the costs. CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/601524617916882944
Personally, I'd 100% expect it to be something almost everyone just pokes at for a week or two and then drops. CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/601525079705526272
Not really an effective use of time for devs who could be working on any number of features for the live game. CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/601525289139773440
Speaking for myself, I'd love to go back and poke at classic. I just don't think I'd play it for long. CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/601524617916882944
Or, the devs could just 'go back to the core roots', as it were. Yep, especially the class designs, every class used to be fun, but in WoD.
If that's the case, I think we'd rather focus on fixing the modern game. CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/601525761363816448


Ghostcrawler Tweets
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Developer Communication
While I didn't always agree with what you had to say, i, at-least, appreciated that you took the time to say it.
Thanks. I figure at least then players can argue whether we aren't hitting our goals or if the goals themselves are bad. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599702877553098753

We miss you dearly GC. @WatcherDev and his team are alienating @Warcraft players with their hubris. 
Whether you like every decision or not, I am confident they have your best interests in mind. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602157807983468544

Game Design
If I was going to make an MMO I'm not I think I'd shoot for something episodic with the expectation players come and go. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599280079118536704
How does the social aspect play into that, though? Sounds like it would be hell on guilds.
I agree, but I think players are episodic already so the business model might as well be. Social hard either way. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599364332313411585
Was there ever a time where that wasn't the case? Is it a more prominent problem today versus 2007?
I *think* so ?. A lot of games, LoL among them, are huge. They try to be the only game you need. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599703266117558272
Which means ironically we tend to drop games as soon as we hit diminishing returns b/c there is so much else out there. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599703579977322496

What you say you prefer and what you actually did ended complete opposite.
I was a lead designer not a dictator. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599599928533389312

It stopped being fun when my hunter was mocked for not pulling over 100k dps. That was a year ago. #NoEpeen
I wish we had been more progressive about trying to curb bad behavior. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599671373196185600
I wish so, too. I would never raid because of all the bs. But i have some awesome rare hunter pets 
One secret is to turn off chat in any game. That is pretty much their only tool in being a tool. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599702565152886784

The game has too much math and has lost the adventure part. ilvl has ruined the fantasy journey of azeroth. Players couldnt see item ilvl back then. There was no need for perfect dpsrotations in molten core. It was an adventure
I don't think it was ilvl per se. There was just less shared knowledge, which makes sense for a younger game in the 2000s. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/600010013453656064
Most of us didn't approach *any* game back then with "How do I min/max this? What is the best spec?" OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/600010146689875968
We played the characters we chose and when our guilds ventured into MC we used what we had. Alts were rarer in those days too. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/600010343104925696

Do you think WoW should have more exclusivity - like it did back in the old days? BC
Exclusivity works when it's stacked on top of normal content not replacing it which just means you need more content. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599573635993481217
I was under the impression that Exclusivity was an integral part of why MMO's were successful in the first place.
I think so. But you can't have special content for the elite and nothing for everyone else. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/600537150363336705

I didn't start WoW until 2007. I recall lots of fun times since, screencaps from most of them, others just memories in brain.
I remember the feelings so vividly. I don't think you can recapture them though. This is also true of most of life, sadly. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599026254411538432
