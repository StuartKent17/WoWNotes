A teaser on the official Warcraft Facebook Page http://www.facebook.com/Warcraft/posts/194142790650384 hints at two new types of NPCs coming in a future patch, most likely Patch 4.3: the Transmogrifier and Void Storage NPCs. 

"Transmogrifier" seems to hint at a way to change the appearance of something, the first thing coming to my mind is either a way to change the look of your items it was experimented in the past with things such as Darkspear Overcloak http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75693/darkspear-overcloak/ but dropped later. I guess it could also be a way to change facial/body features on characters.

The "Void Storage" is probably ... well, another kind of storage? Or a high-tech magic trash can.
