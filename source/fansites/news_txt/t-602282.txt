Boubouille2007-09-24, 04:52 AMUS Test Server II down and no reset to premades
Sorry guys, you're not getting additional premades. 
US Test Server II US PVP is not going to be available for 2.2.2 testing. 

Any characters that were copied to this server will be unavailable. We apologize for any confusion or inconvenience. 

UPDATE: There are currently no plans to reset pre-mades or character copies. If this changes an announcement will be made.


Brewfest guide
I made a few updates to the brewfest guide, and added a few explanations about some quests like the daily part of "There and Back Again". See below.
Also, the goggles you can buy for 100 tickets will change players into female orcs for horde players, not gnomes. See the screenshots, thanks to joyu

Wowhead forums
Wowhead opened their forums, you can either flood no, don't, or they'll break my legs the general discussion forum. There is also a suggestion forum up, and it's fairly interesting to see that kind of forum on an item database site.
