Shattered Oath (http://shatteredoath.com/forum/portal.php) (US - Emerald Dream) has been progressing nicely on the Legendary Staff questline and released a video of the Delegation (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29234/delegation/) quest to recover the Branch of Nordrassil (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71084/branch-of-nordrassil/) after defeating Volcanus the Firelord. <br>
<br>
The video below is from a Restoration Druid point of view, they also released one from an Arcane Mage PoV (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lkpHyHDvn8).<br>
<br>
Description from the video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lkpHyHDvn8)<br>
Poor guy. Three phase fight, pretty easy. If you wipe you must do all the phases again.<br>
<br>
Phase 1: Harbingers of Flame are the same trash from Alysrazor but more of them, just assign interrupters.<br>
<br>
Phase 2: The Tormented Protector should be tanked away from the middle. He&apos;ll root the entire raid then cast a 1,000 yard knockback that will knock you off the edge to your death unless you have his roots debuff on you. The roots also tick for 10,000 a second and should be dispelled after his stomp.<br>
<br>
Burning Treants spawn in the middle, move slowly and pulse a hellfire around them that will kill you if you stand near them, ranged should kill and knockback them.<br>
<br>
Phase 3: Volcanus himself summons slow moving columns of killsyou and pulses a steadily increasing AoE so you should bloodlust on him.<br>

Dungeon Journal bugs and accuracy<br>
We are looking at the concerns over the faces blocking the map view in the Dungeon Journal. We&apos;re aware of this concern and may provide an option to turn them off at a future point in time. We&apos;ll provide information on this though when we are able.<br>
<br>
As for the concerns over accuracy, there is always the potential for information to change based on adjustments made to the bosses and the fights. Overall though, the Dungeon Journal should be seen as an accurate representation of the boss fights and abilities. We have seen a lot of misunderstandings or inaccurate information provided via external sources and hope that the Dungeon Journal can better shore up those external sources with its information.<br>
<br>
As for some concerns over missing loot, we did purposefully leave out &quot;grab-bag&quot; items. Meaning, items that have the potential for dropping on multiple bosses were not added to the listing of items. We may choose to change this decision at a future point in time if we feel that it&apos;s causing additional confusion. For now though, just be aware that these items do not appear in the listed loot tables.

25 Daily Quests Limit<br>
Is there a point in daily quest limits? Yes. Of course there is. Dailies allow people the opportunity to gain (in some cases) reputation as well as money or skills. We also don&apos;t want people feeling that they need to do 100+ daily quests a day just because they can either. It should also be about making choices on an individual basis about what quests you want to work on and still not get overwhelmed by the amount of dailies you feel you need to do each day.<br>
<br>
People have asked us if we&apos;d ever raise the cap to this, and we can&apos;t say we never will. If the time comes that we think it&apos;s a good idea, we&apos;ll address the possibility then. For now, it&apos;s as it is.
