Boubouille2008-03-17, 10:56 AM2.4 PTRs down until further notice
PTRs have been taken down to increase the amount of people testing the TTRs. That's a pretty good news actually because it looks like they need to rush a few tests ... maybe because the patch is going live soon ? 
In order to gather additional logging information for the Tournament Test realm we will be taking down the regular 2.4 PTRs until further notice. We encourage everyone to check out the TTR to help us test our new hardware configurations.

You can find more information regarding the TTR and post your feedback in the Tournament Test Forum.

Comics
First, a small update of comics with the release of Dark Legacy #134 http://www.darklegacycomics.com/134.html, I also received a mail about ... Shakes & Fidget http://www.getbuffed.com/getbuffed/comics/list/1 ! If you've been reading WoW comics for a long time you'll probably remember this one and be very happy to know that it's translated into english once again.
