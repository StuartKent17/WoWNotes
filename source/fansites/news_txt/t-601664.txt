Utgarde Keep Preview
WoWinsider.com  posted a small preview of the Utgarde Keep only playable in the press room. There isn't any major news but it's still worth the reading but there is a very interesting information here.
"We could not use our flying mounts in Northrend. But Blizzard has said they will be able to be used there, they just weren't in the build we played and it made finding that darn keep even harder."
