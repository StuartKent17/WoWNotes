Boubouille2011-07-04, 03:15 AMWoW Expansion "Vengeance of the Void" Rumor is a fake
People are starting to get crazy on forums about a rumor started on a well known hacking/cheating site that we won't mention here, you all know which one it is anyway. 

The information started hitting a couple of news sites because, well, I guess any attention is good and double checking sources is hard because you might want to do that considering what the original source is but I'd rather kill the rumor before people start being very annoying about it. 


 

Why would you believe me more than someone else? Good thing. Well, this document is a pretty obvious fake anyway especially with stuff like "neglected Shadow Priest class" in official documents and Blizzard just doesn't draft that kind of stuff 3 months before the event before they send it to the entire company. 

Btw, internal documents would never say "Activision Blizzard", unless they're scheduled for public release. The address isn't even Blizzard's, it's the Activision Blizzard HQ. You don't send that kind of mail to two companies 3 months before the Blizzcon just for fun.

I mean, seriously guys, Blizzard isn't stupid when it comes to leaks, they don't just take the risk of doing that stuff so early.
