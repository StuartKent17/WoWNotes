Slow Flight Paths
So, first thing I should mention is that, while we're still adjusting and tweaking the flow of each zone, it doesn't make much sense for us to spend a bunch of time optimizing flight paths. Any manner of changes could happen to a given location or quest hub that would require us to redo all that work -- even something as simple as moving the flightmaster to the other side of a camp, or raising the terrain a bit to make it look more interesting.

We've done a little bit of optimizing here and there where we've felt confident that such changes won't happen, but we're getting to the point that we can start collecting a broader range of feedback on flight paths for future adjustments. To help with that, I've just posted a stickied thread in which we'd love for you to share your feedback on flight paths that could use some attention.

We're still very much committed to making sure that getting around Draenor doesn't feel like a chore, so any such feedback is extremely valuable to us. Thanks! Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Targeted Feedback Request: Flight Paths
As we start to wrap up major changes to quest flow and zone layouts, we're ready to start taking a harder look at flight paths and work on cleaning them up. To that end, we're putting this thread together to serve as a centralized location to point out flight paths in need of improvement.

Examples of the sort of feedback we're looking for include:

Flights that seem to move slowly Flights that make unnecessarily meandering loops or turns Flights that could make more efficient connections Any other weird glitches, stops, etc. that occur while on a flight

Thanks! Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Classes
So your version of equality is take away utility from low dps classes and give it to high dps?
No, it's to reduce the utility of high utility classes and increase that of low utility classes, then equalize DPS. Celestalon 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Why is DeathKnight the only class with 2 roles that doesn't have Talents change based on spec when pure DPS classes like mage do
Because none of the talents need it. DKs overlap a lot between tank and DPS. Same resource system, for example. Celestalon 
Many counterexamples. NPlague WAY mandatory for Unholy DPS w/+60% disease dmg, and covers-up Blood's huge wait time.
Those aren't counterexamples. Those are tuning problems. Or do you just mean that they need different tuning by spec? Celestalon 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
dream of cenarius has always interacted with healing touch, why was the decision made to make it a passive heal for balance?
It's really tough to make a talent that's supposed to be DPS neutral for a Moonkin, yet add Healing Touches. Celestalon 
So, the new version still gives you Healing Touches, they just auto-pick their target for you. Celestalon 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
by engine i mean the synergy between master marksman and steady focus etc marksman now looks kindaempty
Yeah, totally understandable. We removed MMarksman because it became a lot less interesting with... Celestalon 
...the switch to making Aimed their main focus dump. Goal is to allow talent choices to add... Celestalon 
...rotational depth and complication, but I think many of their talent choices boil down to 'Use on CD' Celestalon 
I'd say that Focusing Shot does a good job of that, but it's not a style that everyone will like. Celestalon 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Well my feedback is change Arcane Orb is not useful in boss fights and Overpowered is just crappy like Flameglow.
Why do you not find Arcane Orb useful in boss fights? Which boss fights? What makes Overpowered feel crappy to you? Celestalon 
And Flameglow is much less crappy now; we upped its numbers considerably. Have you tried it with that change? Celestalon 
Overpowered is based in proc from AM and even saving those procs you may only prolong AP a few more seconds
You should always be able to prolong it by at least 6sec, more like 12 on avg. That 'fighting against time' style... Celestalon 
...can be a lot of fun. Definitely possible that its effects are heavily RNG; data/analysis on that is welcome. Celestalon 
ok ill give you Overpowered what abiut Arcane Orb is to low damage compared to PC or even Overpowered.
"Low Damage" = Tuning problem. We'll get that fixed. I've heard that the gameplay is a ton of fun. Agree/disagree? Celestalon 

Arcane Orb interacting with the spec is cool. Any thoughts on having Meteor interact more?
I believe we made it cause Ignite, and the delay lets you stack it on top of Pyros, for Combustion Celestalon 
That's awesome! Thanks. Anything to be done with Comet Storm?
Tough one. Not sure that Frost needs more of any procs. Suggestions welcome. Celestalon 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
are you worried that arms might stance dance to fill in gcds if def stance gets devaste and revenge?
Yes, absolutely a concern that we'll make sure doesn't happen with whatever design we settle on. Celestalon 

PvP
There any talk of doing a legendary pvp item done like the cloak?
I don't think so. Rarity and extreme power are inherent to Legendaries and that doesn't seem like the best fit for PvP gear. holinka 

World
What you're telling us right now is that it apparently takes longer that 10 months to make two capitals w/o copy/pasting.
In terms of man-months, it's actually longer, if you can believe it. Muffinus 
How do you not have infinite time.... Blizzard has always stood for releasing quality products with no release dates at all.
Always has to be weighed against the community not getting content for another X months. It's a tough call. Muffinus 

well we could also make Gilneas our home city if we felt like it, but why would we do that? zero hub utility = no visits
You could argue that Silvermoon has full functionality and isn't visited, but is very pretty. Why aren't people there? Muffinus 
At the risk of opening a can of worms: Silvermoon also has no flying and so is esp. awkward to get to compared to the likes of Org
All of Draenor has no flying too Muffinus
