<br>
Build a Panel - World Creation in World of Warcraft<br>
<br>
The team likes the designers to have the freedom to explore the space that they are creating.<br>
Kul Tiras has been in Warcraft lore from the beginning so the team knew it would be a hearty sea-faring culture from Gilneas.<br>
Boralus<br>
<br>
Creating cities in WoW is one of the hardest things that the world builders have to do in WoW.<br>
Early versions of cities have red lines for roads and green spaces for buildings.<br>
The second phase of creating a city has early renderings of buildings so that the design team can figure out how the player navigates the space.<br>
Scale is also a huge part of this phase.<br>
Hamburg, Germany and cities in France were looked at for inspiration for Boralus.<br>
Boralus had many iterations as time went on.<br>
Safe roads were added over time (easy to navigate roads with no hostile mobs).<br>
<br>
<br>
Underrot<br>
<br>
Hulling out a road is the first step in creating a dungeon once you have the initial map.<br>
Secondary textures and terrain detail come next.<br>
Certain parts of the terrain lead you in the direction that you need to go.<br>
Busy areas are often next to areas that are not busy to add contrast.<br>
Underrot was supposed to be a zone originally, but it wasn&apos;t working out. Eventually they decided it worked better as a dungeon.<br>
<br>
Arathi Basin Remastered<br>
<br>
They are still using the engine from vanilla.<br>
They wanted to keep the same feel of Arathi Basin, but just give it the face lift that it deserves.<br>
View distance and opening the space was a big part of the remaster for Arathi Basin.<br>
<br>
<br>
The team likes to add Easter eggs to zones when possible.<br>
One Easter egg was a baby in a bird nest in a tree that the designer thought no one would find, but she checked Reddit and the players did!<br>
Some art is purposeful to trick players into a certain direction, such as leaning trees or lighting.<br>
Iteration is next. They want to make sure the zone is not monotonousness and feels right.<br>
Sometimes they design and create a zone that they love, but when they start to navigate it they realize that they hate it.<br>
A lot of times they design things that don&apos;t work in the moment, but will be saved for later expansions.<br>
Suramar and the disguise mechanic was a little iffy when it was first pitched, but it worked out well.<br>
Drustvar started off as a frozen wasteland inspired by &quot;beyond the wall&quot; in Game of Thrones.<br>
<br>
Several months in the team decided it wasn&apos;t working and changed it to the creepy forest that it is today.<br>
Originally there were only several witch camps on the outskirts, but eventually they incorporated more of that theme.<br>
<br>
A Horde symbol was placed where Varian&apos;s tomb is during design as a joke, but was obviously removed before live.<br>
Putting an oasis in the middle of Vol&apos;dun was done to break up the monotony of the desert.<br>
Small details are added as the final step.<br>
Little props are time consuming, but they tell small stories that add to the environment.<br>
Lighting can be used to highlight parts of the environment.<br>
This expansion in particular emphasizes the teams working together to tell the story.<br>
It is incredible being able to work on a game this long and learn from player feedback.<br>
WoW doesn&apos;t feel like one game. It feels like each expansion is a way to tell a different story.<br>
Amazing things are coming!<br>
