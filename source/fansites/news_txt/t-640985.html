The official patch notes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/8136495630-310-ptr-patch-notes.html) have been updated once again with more changes! Below are the latest additions.<br>
General<br>
Applying a glyph no longer requires a Lexicon of Power. The same rules for switching between dual talent specializations now apply to switching glyphs and cannot be performed while in combat, Battlegrounds (except when Preparation is up), or Arenas (no exceptions).<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Battlegrounds<br>
Battleground quests &#x201C;Concerted Efforts&#x201D; (Alliance) and &#x201C;For Great Honor&#x201D; (Horde) now require an Alterac Valley Mark of Honor in addition to the current requirements. These quests now award more honor upon completion.<br>
Alterac Valley<br>
Drek&#x2019;Thar, Vanndar Stormpike, the tower Heralds and Warmasters have received a hit point and damage upgrade in the level 80 version of Alterac Valley.<br>
Strand of the Ancients<br>
Capturing the Southern Graveyard will now automatically capture both the East and West Graveyards.<br>
Lake Wintergrasp<br>
All players who attack a siege vehicle should now get credit if it is destroyed.<br>
Daily quests &#x201C;Slay Them All!&#x201D; (Horde) and &#x201C;No Mercy for the Merciless&#x201D; (Alliance) have had their PvP kill requirements reduced to 10 from 20. NPCs defending the fortress and south towers now count toward these dailies as well.<br>
The number of NPCs defending fortress has been increased.<br>
The time between battles will be saved should a realm shut down. If Wintergrasp is active when a realm shuts down, the game will restart from the beginning when the realm is once again live.<br>
Towers in Southern Wintergrasp now have more defensive cannons.<br>
<br>
Races: General<br>

The shaman&#x2019;s Fire Elemental and Spirit Wolves, mage&#x2019;s Water Elemental, and druid&#x2019;s Treants have all gained avoidance from area-of-effect damage similar to what warlock and hunter pets already have.<br>
Taunts: All player or pet-generated taunts now have a shared diminish category. In addition, Taunt-type effects from pets and from classes other than death knight, druid, paladin, and warrior have been set such that bosses can be made immune to them while still affected by death knight, druid, paladin, and warrior taunts.<br>
