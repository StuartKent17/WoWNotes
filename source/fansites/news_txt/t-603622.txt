Boubouille2007-12-04, 06:57 AMNothing about the 2.3.2 today, might be updated later but don't get your hopes too high because the latest PTR build introduced a lot of bugs causing Errors #132 and I'm not sure if all of them are fixed. But nothing is impossible if we consider that servers are getting a 8 hours downtime and as usual the bot will be online on

Blue posts
I guess the 2.3 patch and season 3 deployment killed the enthusiasm of our loved blue posters, however there is something that might make a few hunters happy.
Hunters/Ghost Wolves
Even if players weren't supposed to tame Grimtotem Spirit Guides in the first place, the devs agreed that this is a fun use of an in-game mechanics and they therefore have no plans to "fix" the issue. Source http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=1782078645&postId=18049985401&sid=1#3

Heroic Mechanar
The Charged Fist on the Tempest-Forge Destroyers can do a lot of damage, but this is a nice challenge for the group and there are no plans to change them for the moment. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3168364719&postId=32336825690&sid=1#115

Quests
Building money at low level isn't viewed as an issue, don't expect any addition of daily quests or anything helping grinding gold at "low" levels. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3168405277&postId=32333431881&sid=1#3


New feature on Wowhead : In game item links
Wowhead http://www.wowhead.com is everywhere ! Even in game actually. You can now get a line of code to copy in game by clicking the "Get in-game item link" next to each item on the site. Just paste it in any frame window, and you will be able to link the item to your friends by shift clicking it like any other item links ! 
Note: This won't work on items never dropped on your server, you will eventually get disconnected if you keep trying to link an item never "seen" by the server.
