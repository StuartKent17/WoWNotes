A heroes’ journey is long and fraught with danger, but our goblin engineers have managed to cobble a little something special together for you to help make the path to power just a little bit easier.

Beginning Friday, May 30 at 9:00 a.m. realm-time, through Tuesday, June 10 at 9:00 a.m. realm-time, we’ll be applying the Heart of the Valorous buff which will increase the rate of Valor Point gains an additional 100%. Don’t wait to get in on the action!
