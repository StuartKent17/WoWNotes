chaud2014-02-16, 04:39 PMPatch 5.4.7 Live This Week
Patch 5.4.7 is going live this week, with a new PvP season, Level 90 Boost preparation, and other assets for future use.


Season 15 PvP gear will use the same models as Season 14, but with the colors available to each faction switched. 
There will be some minor adjustments http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3769-Upcoming-Siege-of-Orgrimmar-Changes-Challenge-Mode-End-of-Season-Blue-Tweets-Art to Heroic Garrosh 10.
The Level 90 boost feature will be added in this patch, but no announcement has been made as to when it will actually be available.
This patch and launcher updates prepared things for the Warlords of Draenor pre-order, but no date has been announced yet.
The Warlords of Draenor Collector's Edition mount and pet are included in this patch. 
The Scroll of Resurrection ends on Tuesday, so be sure to send out any final invitations before then.
No new realm connections are currently listed for this week.

The Scroll of Resurrection Retires
The time has come to bid adieu to the Scroll of Resurrection. It’s served its divine purpose, but like most scrolls, it only has so many charges before it loses its magic and crumbles into ethereal dust. For those who’d still like a chance to use the scroll, you have until February 18 before players are no longer able to send invitations. For those who have an invitation outstanding, that’s still good for 30 days from the time it was sent, after which point the invitation will expire and the benefits can no longer be claimed.

For additional information on the Scroll of Resurrection, please visit our FAQ. https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/scroll-of-resurrection-faq


Battle.Net Launcher Update
The Battle.Net Launcher was recently updated to add support for Warlords of Draenor.
