The bonus reward will be displayed to eligible system identified as least represented classes within the UI.
Once the dungeon is completed the eligible player will receive a goodie bag with various potential rewards including: gold, rare gems, non-combat pets, and very rare mounts.

Classes: General

Several persistent ground effects now display different visuals for hostile and friendly players. The following spells have the same visual effects for friendly players, but new alternate visuals for hostile players: Ring of Frost, Consecration, Desecration, Wild Mushroom, Flare, Ice Trap, Power Word: Barrier, Smoke Bomb, and Hand of Gul'dan. As a general rule, the alternate effects have a red tint or hue indicating they are created by an enemy player. There are currently some issues with this new change which are affecting several of these abilities and is not working as intended at this time.

Targets and focus targets now display on the mini-map.

The Network category contains the options "Optimize network for speed" and "Enable IPv6 when available".



Visual Settings Updates

Removed the red bar preventing the overall graphics slider from going to ultra based on computer specs.
When the user moves the overall slider to a setting that would have previously been prevented, any option that can't go as high as that setting will get the warning icon with a tooltip explaining why it can't go higher. For example: The user sets the overall slider to Ultra and the water setting can only go to Fair. The water setting would automatically switch to Fair.
Support for DirectX 11 can now be found in the Advanced tab of the Options screen.



At the login screen:

Moved the "Reset User Options" button from the popup window that appears when you click Options to the actual Options window.
