I&apos;m working on a new version (yup, again) of the raid guides, this should be the last update to the old guides (except the kharazan ones :/). This also means new guides soon ^^<br>
<br>
I&apos;ll probably put a &quot;Contact&quot; page online soon to make it easier for people to send me news, informations, and insults.</div></div>
