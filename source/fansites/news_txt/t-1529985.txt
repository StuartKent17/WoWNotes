Warlords of Draenor - Dark Portal
The Dark Portal model that is located in Draenor appears to still be in progress, as it is missing textures for most of the model, but it does have an interesting addition compared to the Outland version. 

The Draenor version of the Dark Portal has a small room under it that may be related to the Gul'dan's Prison http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/34393-guldans-prison quest, which mentions Gul'dan http://wowpedia.org/Gul%27dan being held below the Dark Portal to power it. If you are interested in the quests that involve the Draenor Dark Portal, take a look at the early preview of the intro experience quest line http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3960-Warlords-of-Draenor-Quest-Preview-May-2-Hotfixes-Blue-Tweets-Classic-Games-Art.

Build 18297 http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4010-Warlords-of-Draenor-Alpha-Build-18297 also added a red version of the Dark Portal in Outland, which currently isn't being used anywhere. There is also some nice Fan Art http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1529492-%28Mock-up%29-WoD-Login-Screen-UDK4-0 that uses it to make a login screen.

Also, I think it's being suggested that in high end raiding, choice in talent in that tier is an illusion.
For literally the top 0.1% of players, it's a non-choice. For the rest, it's a way to customize the feel of the rotation. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/471326044591374337
Is that the top 0.1% of raiders or all players? Raiders as those seeing the content.
The "content" in this case is the talent tiers themselves, no? In which case they are relevant to everyone. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/471336303368216576

Character / Items
If we've deleted certain toys in the past will they still appear in the toybox? due to having the Q completed I.e: Marmot
We hope to, but are unsure what form that will take. Source https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/473875411038789634

Are drop rates going to be higher to compensate for gear changing stats and the same item being usable by more people?
Drop chances and treasure table structure are both going under the knife for some upgrades to account for the new paradigms. Source https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/473981369807159296

PvE
What are your thoughts on Challenge modes being cheesed by use of Invis pots?
Invis pots are the counterbalance for Shroud of Concealment. Otherwise rogue would be mandatory. Mob kill count keeps it sane. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/471342739783548928

Since CMs will still downscale gear, and therefore still be challenging, could their loot tables improve each tier?
Quite possibly, yes, but it's too early to make a definite call on that. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/471336816709099520
I thought the plan was later patches have new dungeons + old dungeons scale up to remain relevant to avoid burnout
That's what we'd discussed. Scaling up CM gear rewards as new tiers unlock is a separate question entirely. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/471344046456455168

Free Faction Change
Question. Why free transfer to alliance for faster queue when after doing so horde queues will be fast again? Defeats the purpose?
Queue length is not the primary reason people transfer. Cost is the primary reason they don't. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/471312343314362368

Servers/Cross servers NEED to be faction balanced. PvP servers/players DO NOT want a server with a dead opposite faction = boring.
Ironically PvE servers have great faction ratios. PvP servers are the ones that have trended towards imbalance. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/471312715571400706

PvP
is blizzard working toward anything to stop DDOS or compensating for it, especially in the rbg environment?
DDOS attacks occur outside the realm of control of Blizzard. I recommend you do not use programs that make your IP address known. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469724872948477953

Just wondering what Bliizard's opinion is on Horde in Isle of Conquest?
I think Horde avoid it or give up too easily. They used to win it handily. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469911385552744448

Any chance the base wow arena Tournament UI getting revamped soon? No life bars over characters is hard to follow.
We have discussed ways to improve including low hanging fruit like nameplates and reducing number of buffs, damage/healing numbers. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/470415052638404608

Are honor/cp rewards staying the same for random BGs in WoD, or are we switching to only drops?
Random BG/Call to Arms won't give an honor bonus anymore. It will be strong boxes. So today's system with a different bonus. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/470623712274690048

It is my impression that damage, in PvP, scales twice as fast as healing, because there are generally two DPS per Healer. True?
False. Those scale in parallel; no net scaling difference. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470781494181380097

with long fears being reduced to 6 seconds, will you address sap, as it's a indirect nerf to sap and its function?
no plans to change sap holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/471319283507552256

Professions
so gathering profs are largely irrelevant with farming in MoP, any interest in making a secondary 'gathering' slot?
Something we have considered, but we'll just be focusing on making gathering useful this time around. Source https://twitter.com/TheCrafticus/status/470775692939247616

New Jumper cables and Army knife, no engineering requirement on them? What's the point in being an engineer now?
Knife has a requirement now. We decided against the other cables. Source https://twitter.com/TheCrafticus/status/471066449914912768
so new knife, Eng can combat res? please say yes if it fails or not anymore? would consume a res charge or not?
Not a combat rez, but will work 100% of the time. Side effects on the engineer may still occur.

Pets and Pet Battles
Could we get a sneak peek of one of those very cool bonuses? 
Here ya go: We will be introducing a new type of battle pet stone that grants levels to pets instead of quality. Source https://twitter.com/mumper/status/472061474836201472
