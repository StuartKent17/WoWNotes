Legion - Arcane Hippogryph Mount
Legion adds a new hippogryph mount that goes nicely with Brightpaw  and the Mystic Runesaber  mount. There is no spell, item, or source yet, so we can't be sure if you will be able to obtain this mount.

Legion - Fel Core Hound Mount
The only existing Core Hound  mount was a reward from the WoW 10th Anniversary celebration, but Legion adds a new Fel Core Hound. There is no spell, item, or source yet, so we can't be sure if you will be able to obtain this mount.

Character / Items
Can you guys please add Winter's Grasp and Flames to the Stolen Present? One chance a year is nuts!
.Feedback received, they will be account wide xmogs in Legion, should feel rare and special. Muffinus 
No changes planned for this event? Gone through 7 characters and have neither, and never got Flames from Rag :-
We will continue to monitor the feedback Muffinus 

PvP
what's the purpose of making people start over with prestige levels? Why not just continue gaining xp/prest after 50?
We want the decision to Prestige to be optional, but not trivial. If everyone does it, it's not nearly as "Prestigious." WarcraftDevs 

Stay true to the idea of a tank being hit; make Taunt give penalties for not hitting tank, such as reduced damage dealt.
We don't think the fantasy of "I get hit" works well in PvP. Prefer to work on the "I'm on the front line" fantasy instead. WarcraftDevs 

Curious how you landed on 0.1%/ilvl. What was the target goal? Is 0.2% or 0.5%/ilvl too much?
It's based on the full spectrum of item levels in the tier. WarcraftDevs 

Looks fun!Will stat nullificationreallocation activate upon entering pvp combat in open world or only in instance pvp?
Only in instanced PvP. WarcraftDevs 

Transmogrification
Will Winter's Grasp and Flames of Ragnaros be xmogable enchants in Legion if you have them?
Yep! WarcraftDevs 

Garrisons
Anything that can be passed on about the 'Garrison Resources' that MMO-champion brought up?
What's been datamined for Class Order Missions is very early dev. Expect quite a few changes between Garrisons and Order Halls. WarcraftDevs 

Are bodyguards going to be in Legion? Please tell me Illona is a follower, somehow, some way! I would follow HER if I could!!!
Some followers will have the ability to be bodyguards, but it may function differently to what you're used to in WoD. WarcraftDevs 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Hi Greg, just wondering your thoughts; why do designers rarely make things "Nintendo Hard" nowadays? 
1 Game budgets are 1000x what they were in the NES days, so it's a big risk to have players not like your game. OccupyGStreet 
2 Many games are so story based that devs and players want you to reach the end of the story. OccupyGStreet 
3 The devs forget that getting better at something and finally mastering it is immensely satisfying. OccupyGStreet
