Removing Secondary Traits from Relics
In the next PTR build, you’ll see that we’ve replaced the final Order Hall research which caused relics to gain a second trait at random with one that grants a chance for Artifact Power rewards from World Quests to be doubled.

We’re doing this for a few reasons, the largest of which being that we simply weren’t satisfied with the current state of the system. There were several rough edges, including a few which were pointed out by your feedback. While these issues could be solved, we weren’t confident we could do so in a way that meets our standards in time for 7.2, so we’d rather shelve the idea for now.

That said, we definitely feel that there’s more that can be done with relics, and are discussing some possible ideas for a future Legion update. We don’t have anything to share just yet, but it’s something we’re thinking about. Thanks again for all the feedback on this topic!


PTR Build Deploy 3/7/2017
Greetings all,
We'll be bringing down the PTR realms in order to deploy a new 7.2.0 build. No ETA for today's push but I'll ping this thread if things look like they're going to take longer than usual 4-6 hours. 

As always, I'll leave this thread open for discussion so long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines.

Thanks!


Druid Class Mount Issues
Quick heads up about a change you'll be seeing in the next build.

We've found a few issues, and we're going to need to temporarily remove the Archdruid's Lunarwing Form from the mount journal. The option to change the look of your flight form will be available as an NPC in your class hall, operating similarly to the Glyph of the Sentinel.

We're working on getting a solution to you as soon as we can, apologies and thanks!

Also, since we're here, if you prefer it this way, please let us know.
