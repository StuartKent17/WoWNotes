&quot;Boring&quot; talents<br>
Every player is going to have a different definition of &quot;boring or bland talents&quot; so that&apos;s not going to be a great litmus test. We&apos;re probably keeping Improved Overpower. It&apos;s the kind of talent that makes Overpower more powerful for an Arms warrior or just makes the ability more powerful in general. Because the talent affects one ability it can have a greater magnitude which is more noticeable than say a 5% damage buff.<br>
<br>
Cruelty is the kind of talent we&apos;ll replace (probably by making it affect only a handful of abilities) and tanking talents like Anticipation (if we can get away with it). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25172118512/mastery-design-intent/))<br>

Vigilance<br>
The Taunt renew part of Vigilance is cool and being able to essentially Salv someone can be useful to. Actually gaining threat from using the ability makes it feel like Defiance 2.0 though. You feel like you have to use it all the time (not that that&apos;s a huge burden, but still) to achieve the threat levels that other tanks essentially get without the talent.
