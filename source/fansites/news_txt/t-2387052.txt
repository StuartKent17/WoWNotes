Introducing Heroes and Overwatch News on MMO-Champion 

<div style="max-width: 900px; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">For over a decade, MMO-Champion has been known as the premiere source for World of Warcraft news, patch updates, and more. We’ve traveled with you to new zones, leveled alongside you through multiple expansions, and rejoiced with you as we defeated the Legion once and for all. Now, we’re embarking on an entirely new journey: even more Blizzard game coverage.

We’re excited to unveil our new Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch news sections, where diehard fans and new players alike can stay up-to-date on gaming content they love. Learn more about the lore  surrounding the newest Overwatch character. Discover the latest patch changes  in Heroes of the Storm. These new content sections are accessible via the respective game logos at the top of the site.

As always, we’ll continue to provide you with the World of Warcraft content you know and love. Thanks for sticking with us all these years and for joining us on this new adventure. Go with honor, friend.
