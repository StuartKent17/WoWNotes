Also added PTR Notes update and raid testing schedule at the end of the post. <br>
<br>
PTR 3.2 - Build 10128<br>
This is a minor build and most of the changes were in the Patch Notes update posted this morning.<br>
<br>
New Halloween Masks!<br>
I joked about that in the original post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=79546.0) but I didn&apos;t realize that Blizzard would actually add new masks in the next build just to create some confusion. Oh well, new Halloween masks have been added to the game in addition to the Goblins and Worgens masks from the previous build. <br>
<br>
This update doesn&apos;t change my view on the new races of the expansion (Goblins and Worgens) but I&apos;m sure tons of people will be happy to discuss this addition. I&apos;m not getting naked (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=79546.msg1169037#msg1169037) yet. <br>

PTR 3.2 - Patch Notes Update<br>
The official patch notes have been updated once again!<br>
Wintergrasp<br>
Industrial Warfare: This achievement has been removed.<br>
To provide players with a more transparent notification of when Wintergrasp battles occur, as well as better control zone population and stability, several changes have been made.<br>
The queue will accept up to 120 players from each faction, resulting in a maximum battle of 240 players at a time.<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight<br>
Blood Strike: The bonus damage this ability receives from diseases on the target has been increased to 25% per disease.<br>
<br>
Engineering<br>
Increased siege damage caused by Saronite Bombs and the Global Thermal Sapper Charge.<br>
<br>
World Environment<br>
Wolvar and Gorloc orphans have arrived in Dalaran and need your help! Players can find out more by visiting the Eventide District (completing the quests being offered for this event will not count toward any Children&#x2019;s Week achievements). Players have a limited amount of time to care for these orphans before they take their leave. They will then return again for the regularly-scheduled Children&#x2019;s Week next year. <br>
<br>
PTR Raid and Dungeon Testing (July 21)<br>
Here&apos;s the current schedule for Trial of the Crusader PTR testing:<br>
<br>
On the North American test realms:<br>
<br>
Anub&#x2019;arak - Tuesday Night, July 21, starting at 7pm EDT. Normal and Heroic.<br>
<br>
On the European test realms:<br>
<br>
Val&apos;kyr &#x2013; Wednesday Night, July 22, starting at 19:00 CEST. Normal and Heroic.<br>
<br>
Some of the tests will have multiple bosses and difficulties available for testing, as noted above.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re going to try and have Test Patchwerks (Tank and DPS versions) available in the Argent Coliseum for testing. Instead of the previous tank test patchwerk that increased melee damage over time, the 3.2 tank test patchwerk will just hit VERY hard (as hard as Algalon) all the time to allow for more lengthy sustained tank parses. We&apos;re always interested in seeing combat logs and parses for all raid testing on the PTR, but especially test patchwerk logs. These are extremely helpful to our class team.<br>
<br>
This schedule could change at a moment&apos;s notice due to server, bug, or patch status. I&apos;ll try to keep everyone informed as much as possible. The Trial of the Crusader and the bosses to be tested will remain also open a variable length of time. How long they stay open depends upon a host of factors including designer availability, bug status, etc. These bosses are very much a work in progress, and this is a test server.</div></div>
