A quick outline of what to expect in the future of Overwatch!

New Hero: Development of Moira

Moira is the new Support Healer
The geneticist of the team
Moira doesn't allow morals to come in the way of science

Ultimate Ability: Coalescence, which is a frontal beam


Skins

Oasis: She was invited to be the minister of Genetics in Oasis

Gameplay

Biotic Grasp: Primary fire is Regeneration, which is a healing throughput. Controlled by a meter
Secondary fire is Decay, which does damage and fills the meter back up. Small amount of Leech
Fade Shift: A small dash, making her invisible, which also grants movement speed
Biotic Orb E: Pulls out two orbs, then the healing one can be activated by Primary fire, or damage orb by Secondary fire
This orb does AOE healing, bounces around, slows down when it is close to a friendly target
Coalescence Q: Long range frontal beam that heals allies and damages enemies affected by it
This ultimate pierces barriers
