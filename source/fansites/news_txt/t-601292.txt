Boubouille2007-05-18, 06:26 PMOur Archimonde loot table has been updated and now contains 12 items 15 if you count the 3 possible tier 6 helm tokens, we can assume it's nearly complete now. Reposting it mostly because I can't post anything today that will survive the announcement of the new Blizzard game in a few hours. It's not WoW related, but hey, we love Blizzard don't we ?

The latest updates are the Scepter of Purification and the Midnight Chestguard this one was dropped yesterday by Forte 


     
     
     
     

It's "old" news, but it may "interest" some people. I personally wish a lot of fun to the one who will take his place, I'll skip my turn. 
Tseric is now pursuing other opportunities and we wish him the best in his future endeavors.
