<br>
The activity on Blizzard&apos;s side is fairly restricted these days since most of the activity seems to be on the Alpha forums according to what I hear. I will probably start pushing live the Cataclysm menu and a few other things today (= I might break the site a little) since the NDA lasts longer than I expected and it&apos;s probably worth it to do temporary pages. <br>
<br>
Also, don&apos;t forget that Ruby Sanctum testing is tonight! <br>
<br>
Cataclysm Screenshot of the Day<br>
A new screenshot has been added to the official Screenshot of the Day Gallery (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/downloads/ssotd/). Today is another look at Gilneas. <br>

Reminder - Ruby Sanctum PTR Testing Today<br>
Now that the 3.3.5 patch is available for PTR testing, we wanted to have a round of focus testing for Ruby Sanctum. Only normal mode will be available, with Heroic testing to occur at a later date.<br>
<br>
Everything related to this zone is implemented for this test, please note any issues with the trash creatures and sub-bosses, loot, achievements, and quests.<br>
<br>
US Testing Schedule:<br>
Date to be determined<br>
<br>
EU Testing Schedule:<br>
Tuesday, May 18 starting at 19:30 CEST.<br>
<br>
We plan to allow testing for an extended period. However since this is the Test Realm, unforeseen issues could delay or cancel testing at any time. <br>

Elitist Armory<br>
Today is a slow news day, so here&#x2019;s a new armory website that popped up! It&#x2019;s related to an addon I mentioned a few months ago, Elitist Group (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/elitist-group-blue-posts-comics/).<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Elitist Armory (http://elitistarmory.com) is done by the author of Elitist Group, as with Elitist Group it gives you information on what kind of equipment, gems and enchants a player is using. It also tries to show you information you need, rather than just giving you everything and the kitchen sink.<br>
<br>
I&#x2019;ll be lazy and steal the examples used on the website, Shadow (http://elitistarmory.com/us/mal&apos;ganis/shadow) is a perfect profile, while Amarand (http://elitistarmory.com/us/mal&apos;ganis/amarand) has multiple item and talent issues.<br>
<br>
Powered by<br>
You can add support for tooltips showing Elitist Armory information by using the powered by (http://elitistarmory.com/powered) support, all you have to do is include a little bit of Javascript.<br>
<br>
Guild<br>
The guild feature will allow you to quickly see how good and how accurate your raid teams gear is. This guild (http://elitistarmory.com/g/us/mal&apos;ganis/internet%20relay%20chat/0/9) is probably not going to be killing 25-man heroic Lich King anytime soon!<br>
<br>
Equipment, gems and enchants<br>
Items are categorized into their basic types by stats. Items with defense rating are tank items or if they have spell power then it&#x2019;s a caster item. Players are classified into a tank, caster dps, melee dps or range dps role depending on their talents and profiles are built based on if an item is useful for them. A Hunter would be penalized for wearing items with Spirit, while a Holy Priest would not.<br>
<br>
Unlike Elitist Group, it will also warn players who are Jewelcrafters, but don&#x2019;t have three Dragon&#x2019;s Eyes socketed, or Blacksmiths who aren&#x2019;t using their extra sockets. It will even show a players gear for both of their specs if it&#x2019;s available.<br>
<br>
It includes basic searching for item upgrades by their type, such as finding upgrades for Boots of Wintry Endurance (http://elitistarmory.com/item/45565/spirit-healer).<br>
<br>
Dungeon experience<br>
Rather than showing experience by a long list of achievements, you can a simple summarized percent based on the same numbers used in Elitist Group. Dungeon experience is broken down by number of players and by heroic vs normal difficulty. Claiming a character (http://elitistarmory.com/faq#claim), will let you show your main characters experience if you play a lot of alts.</div></div>
