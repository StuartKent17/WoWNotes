Legion - Moose Mount
For players that don't get the Grove Warden , there is still hope for a moose mount. Legion adds a new moose mount model, but there is no spell, item, or source yet, so we can't be sure if you will be able to obtain this mount.

Can you guys please add Winter's Grasp and Flames to the Stolen Present? One chance a year is nuts!
No that is not rare. A'lar is rare. Rivendare's mount is rare. One chance in a lifetime simply sucks.
It's do-able yearly, per character, not a one-time quest. Muffinus
