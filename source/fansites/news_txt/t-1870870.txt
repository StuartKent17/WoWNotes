Blue Tweets - Developer Communication
How many game designers have been fired via online petition? Asking for a friend.holinka 
Hmm maybe you know @OccupyGStreet? holinka 
#AndThatsHowRumourStarts
Ha ha, no I just mean he had many of these silly petitions in his time. Just pointing out we've seen this before. holinka 
The more likely outcome is your boss says "Keep doing what you're doing, but stop talking to players because it's controversial." OccupyGStreet 
Yep, ties into that "why game devs don't communicate with players" article you linked previously. Celestalon 
I don't think this particular group cares about communication. They are unhappy and want corrective action. holinka 
They are operating under the false belief that I am standing in the way of them getting what they want. holinka 

Can't punish communication to all players due to a horrible few.
Our team's strategy is to communicate through @WarcraftDevs & not our personal accounts. That's fine. holinka 

Jay Wilson
Ha! I know for a fact that isn't true. holinka 
I know, but I still think he was majorly unfairly crucified in the community. They also seem to take 'credit' for him leaving.
Yes certainly unfortunate. He is like a design buddha. Kind and helpful to everyone he meets. holinka 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
With an MMO, not necessarily WoW mind, how important should micro vs macro customization be? Are big choices more fun?
Typically you don't get to make the big choices very often so having the "tweaky" little ones can feel satisfying IMO. OccupyGStreet 

is it a lost cause to try to get players to express right feedback versus the wrong type of feedback?
I find it cumbersome to give players too many rule about how they can provide feedback. OccupyGStreet 
If you can get them to consider how their feedback will be viewed oh this guy is just ranting that can focus their point. OccupyGStreet 


Computers - Setup of the Month
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices  are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. 

New CPUs from Intel and GPUs from AMD are here, but they aren't huge improvements over the previous generation. 

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 6700K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions!
