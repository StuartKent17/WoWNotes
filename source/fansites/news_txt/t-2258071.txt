chaud2017-07-18, 07:24 PM7.3 PTR Build Deploy - 7/18/2017
Greetings all,
PTR realms will be coming down today in order to deploy a new 7.3.0 build. No ETA for today's push but I'll do my best to update this thread if things look like they're going to take longer than usual ~4-6 hours. 

As usual I'll leave this thread open for discussion so long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines.

Thanks for your patience everyone.


World Boss - Drugon the Frostblood
Drugon the Frostblood  is up this week, rewarding players with gold and a chance at item level 860 loot. 


  


Weekly Bonus Event - Arena Skirmishes
Sharpen your swords and reinforce your boards, because you’re called to the PvP Arena for the hectic mayhem of Skirmishes.

This Week: Arena Skirmishes
All week, from anywhere in Azeroth, open the Group Finder default hotkey: i, select the Player vs. Player tab on the bottom of the window, and then under Arena Battles, choose either 2v2 or 3v3 and JOIN BATTLE. You’ll be matched up with teammates and provided with opponents to kill in the Arena.

Look for the following all week long:


Archmage Timear  near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest  for you.

If you’ve been looking to make some Honor gains, this is the week to do it!
