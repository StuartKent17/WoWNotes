You might experience a short downtime on the site during the morning EST Time, it probably won't last more than 15 minutes.

Anyway, servers should be much better today and the downtime should improve them even more, I'm not sure of what will happen with the download servers I tested yesterday but for the moment they're still here, so enjoy them. 


PTR Patch mirrors
I updated the PTR patch mirrors with the latest PTR build 7720, as a reminder the "lag fix" I posted a few ago shouldn't be needed anymore in this one, feel free to run some tests.

List of changes
Everything is in the 2.3.2 Changes post  kid !

Also, if you tried to copy a warlock during the week end, it's probably not usable.
The premade warlocks that were copied over the weekend Undead and human were broken and not allowing players to log in with them. These characters are un-recoverable. If you copied a premade warlock and can not log in with it go ahead and delete the character.

New premade warlock templates have been created orc and human and are working correctly.

We do not currently plan to reset premade characters. Many patches ago in anticipation of problems like this arising we increased the original premade limit of two per account to four per account. So for all effects and purposes you have already received two extra premades. Source 


No server downtimes during Holidays
Good news, according to Nethaera there won't be any long downtimes during holidays. 
Over the holidays, on December 25th and January 1st, we will be performing a series of rolling restarts for all realms starting at 5:00 AM PDT, in lieu of weekly maintenance. Each realm is anticipated to be down for no more than 15 minutes, and should additional maintenance be necessary, we will notify our players in advance. Have a happy holiday!


Blue posts
Nothing really impressive today, upcoming christmas holiday probably don't help. However we might finally get the explanation of the mechanics behind the new AV points calculation "soon".
Alterac Valley points calculation
Clarification on the new calculation of AV points introduced a few weeks ago should be available prior to the weekend. Source 

Invisible mode.
The idea of adding an invisible mode to the game =hiding your status online status on /who or friend lists has been brought up a few times, Blizzard doesn't feel that having this option is a beneficial addition to a multiplayer game. Source 

XP Shut off
There are no current plans to let players "block" their xp gains intentionally just to avoid leveling. Source 

Old PvP Ranks
If developpers feel there is a compelling reason and it fits well with the game to bring them back, we could do it, but for the time being they have no plans to do so. Source 

Will new races ever be added ?
"Never is a bad word to use, there is always the possibility of this happening in the future, we just don't plan to do it for Wrath of the Lich King." Source
