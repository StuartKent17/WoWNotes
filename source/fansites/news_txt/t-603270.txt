It seems that you cannot communicate with other teams anymore during arena matches in 2.3.
Whispers are blocked.
All /say messages are changed to a generic emote. ****** says something unintelligible."





Hunter Bugfixes
The hunters nerfs are definitely here on purpose and have been added to the patch notes. You should still be able to drink during trash mobs fights. 
Fixed a bug in which Hunters were able to use Readiness in conjunction with Freezing Trap on two different targets.
Fixed a bug in which Hunters were able to disengage from combat using Feign Death during boss encounters. 



Skald fire elementals bug
According to this blue post http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2968178446&postId=29491835017&sid=1#2, it seems that the fire elementals in Skald north of Blade's Edge Mountains are bugged and instantly respawn. I checked it this morning and it's still working so I guess it could be a good time to farm primal fires.
