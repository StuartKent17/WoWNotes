Cataclysm Beta - Build 12539
A new build has been deployed on beta realms. 

Important - Login Fix
Hi guys,

We've made some changes to the login server, however these changes didn't quite stick. You will not be able to login without doing the following:

1. Navigate to the following folder in your beta install.
~\Data\enUS**
2. Open up your realmlist.wtf file with a text editing document.
3. Change the "set portal public-beta" line to "set portal public-test"
4. Save this change.

At this point you should be able to login normally.

**This folder will differ depending on which language you installed WoW Beta with. For example if you have a German install, the folder will be deDE.

If you still have issues with logging in please post here!

Thanks guys and sorry for the inconvenience.
