Epic Battle Pet Stones in Legion
Hi everyone!

First and foremost, thank you very much for testing pet battles in the Legion Alpha. We’ve heard your concerns and have decided not to move forward with epic pet battle stones in Legion.

To explain a bit about how we arrived at this point--

When designing rewards for the new battle pet features in Legion and the revamped pet store in Dalaran, we considered epic stones a potential direction to go. Some players are nearing the cap of max-level, all-rare pet teams, and we wanted to see if this space would satisfy their needs for a long-term future level of investment. 

You have correctly identified a few of the issues that come up with this feature:

New players now have a harder time catching up though we could mitigate this by speeding up the early leveling process. Players with 600+ rare pets that felt as if they were nearing completion of their pet journal are back to having 600+ pets to level. Power Creep – older content is now easier, future content is harder for new players entering pet battles.

One of the things we like about pet battles is that much of the early content stays relevant through all of the expansions. Similarly, the collection aspect of battle pets works well when it’s wider more pets to collect, more variety in abilities rather than taller more levels. Both of these are very good reasons to avoid adding epic pet stones.

This direction also pushes us to create content that tests max-level-pet-battlers in a way that is not purely numbers, but use of abilities, use of specific pets, and memorization of enemy strategies. The Celestial Tournament was a good example of pet battle content that rewarded a varied and filled pet stable. We have some exciting things in mind for future battles versus tamers!

It’s worth noting that this feature was not intended to replace any gameplay content. We’re working on all sorts of pet battle updates that we’d like to make in future patches. 

Thanks again for all of your feedback. We really appreciate your great ideas and discussion!

people want their classes to have burst aoe because of how fights end up on farm, 1 second lived adds, will legion change this?
Is performance on farm more or less important than performance on progression? Celestalon 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Would you say that participiation was low because ToC released too soon, or not many tried it properly?
Players were really spread out. Some couldn't beat the first boss and others were done. OccupyGStreet 
Previously only the done players would move on to the next tier. ToC began everyone moving up, maybe not finishing OccupyGStreet 

At what point do you just say "if you hate that role, you're playing the wrong class?" SP's were always like that.
Back in the day, rerolling was not easy and players had a connection to their main. Saying they chose poorly was harsh. OccupyGStreet
