Addon - HandyNotes Legion Rares and Treasures
Now is a good time to install the Legion plugin  for HandyNotes ! It includes not only the rares and treasures in the Broken Isles, but the ones in the Demon Hunter starting area as well. 


    


Addon - Camera Zoom Fix
This addon  sets the camera zoom distance to max every time you log in, saving you from having to manually enter the console command and fix your zoom level until a patch stops the resetting.

The chance to hit with Fel Rush has been aligned with the enemy’s full hitbox, rather than the center of the enemy.
Players that disconnect during the starting experience quest “Breaking Out” do not need to abandon and reaccept the quest in order to continue.
Fixed a bug that was preventing Demon Hunters from using Heart of the Nightwing and the Obsidian Nightwing mount.


 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Casting Surrender to Madness while in Proving Grounds no longer kills you.


 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator

Thunder Clap will now more reliably hit targets near the edge of its radius.


Dungeons and Raids

Increased the health of many low-level Classic dungeon enemies.
Fixed a bug that hid the entrance portal to Zul’Gurub in rare cases.


Event

Fixed a bug that was preventing some zones that were marked for invasion from beginning the invasion as expected.
Demon invasion final world bosses now do moderately less damage to players.
Nethershards can now be found on the remains of the Reconstructed Fel Reaper 5000 and Dread Commander Nath'razel.
Mounted players will now properly see dialogue during Legion invasions.
Turn Ally no longer works on a player that is already under the effects of Give in to Darkness.
Fixed a bug that caused the time remaining for some invasions to display an incorrect value.

Players who received the Sargerei Disguise  and destroyed it should have the toy added to their collection.


Quests

During "A Lingering Suspicion", the quest item Loathsome Remnant should always drop, regardless of how quickly Tormented Souls or Tormented Citizens are killed.

Please keep in mind there is a cooldown after this occurs. However, if you are searching for more than an hour or so and haven't found one, please post in this thread and let us know.

Legion Release and Events
this isn't fair for us in europe..we have to wait more and avoid spoilers..SHAME!
Unlocking everything requires a maintenance, alas. But the roles will be reversed in 21 days... WatcherDev 
so you mean there will be no time difference?
Legion unlocks in Europe ~9 hours before it does in NA, since it's the 30th there before it is here. WatcherDev 

is Dalaran event going to be available after aug 30 or only those who log in on launch day will be part of it?
Everything is available after 8/30 except demon invasions. Muffinus 
including all broken shore questline? I thought they weren't going to be available after 8/3! thanks!
They are shortcut so you can get into BI faster, but you can go back and do everything by talking to Archivist Elysiana in Dalaran Muffinus 

Wasn't the quest with Jaina leaving Dalaran supposed to be today, or am I wrong?
Next week Muffinus 

Ravika 5.3 vendor only spawns for lvl 100+ Horde on Broken Shore quest - Alliance can't get cosmetic shoes. Intended?
Horde also get Fo'rum the Postmaker, Alliance get a Lucky Shirt vendor and Alaina's Bonnet Muffinus 
Note to Horde players: Fo'rum's posts are not bound, sell an angry post to an Alliance player today! Muffinus 

The limited time items: anything for Nethershards, Invasion weapons looking in to the drop rate, Pocket Fel Spreader. That's it. Muffinus 
Pocket Fel Spreader will be unattainable for those of us who preordered physical CE rather than digital right? Can't afford both 
Nope! Anyone can fight an ousted Dreadlord. You just need to be able to locate demons Muffinus 

DO demon invasions get harder as Legion gets closer? or just more common?
Intensity increases by 300% each week Muffinus 

Are you required to do the Broken Shores scenario before starting Legion? Or can you skip it on your alts and go into the action?
.After 8/30, once you've seen Dalaran teleport, you can skip everything on your alts and go right to dalaran and start artifacting Muffinus 
any way to get nethershard vendor now on alts without doing broken shore 11 more times?
Illidari vendors should be present in all zones where invasions occur all the time with the goods. Muffinus 

Camera
Any updates regarding the zoom speed bug? I'm currently playing like this to avoid the worst of it:
It isn't a bug but a deliberate change. It'll take a future patch to introduce a CVar to allow fine-tuning of adjustment speed. WatcherDev 


Legion - Mechanized Lumber Extractor
The Mechanized Lumber Extractor  mount is a reward of the Remember to Share  achievement for collecting 300 toys. If you don't want to collect all of those toys, the Sky Golem  is a very similar option.
