Legion Release and Events
this isn't fair for us in europe..we have to wait more and avoid spoilers..SHAME!
Unlocking everything requires a maintenance, alas. But the roles will be reversed in 21 days... WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/763052180442001409
so you mean there will be no time difference?
Legion unlocks in Europe ~9 hours before it does in NA, since it's the 30th there before it is here. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/763056591293648896

is Dalaran event going to be available after aug 30 or only those who log in on launch day will be part of it?
Everything is available after 8/30 except demon invasions. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763042296119955456
including all broken shore questline? I thought they weren't going to be available after 8/3! thanks!
They are shortcut so you can get into BI faster, but you can go back and do everything by talking to Archivist Elysiana in Dalaran Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763042773742161920

Wasn't the quest with Jaina leaving Dalaran supposed to be today, or am I wrong?
Next week Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763108300078538752

Ravika 5.3 vendor only spawns for lvl 100+ Horde on Broken Shore quest - Alliance can't get cosmetic shoes. Intended?
Horde also get Fo'rum the Postmaker, Alliance get a Lucky Shirt vendor and Alaina's Bonnet Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763146384472104960
Note to Horde players: Fo'rum's posts are not bound, sell an angry post to an Alliance player today! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763166827904061440

The limited time items: anything for Nethershards, Invasion weapons looking in to the drop rate, Pocket Fel Spreader. That's it. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763237523392831488
Pocket Fel Spreader will be unattainable for those of us who preordered physical CE rather than digital right? Can't afford both 
Nope! Anyone can fight an ousted Dreadlord. You just need to be able to locate demons Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763240122443706370

DO demon invasions get harder as Legion gets closer? or just more common?
Intensity increases by 300% each week Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763242903309168640

Are you required to do the Broken Shores scenario before starting Legion? Or can you skip it on your alts and go into the action?
.After 8/30, once you've seen Dalaran teleport, you can skip everything on your alts and go right to dalaran and start artifacting Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763426018279370752
any way to get nethershard vendor now on alts without doing broken shore 11 more times?
Illidari vendors should be present in all zones where invasions occur all the time with the goods. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763445911364116480

Camera
Any updates regarding the zoom speed bug? I'm currently playing like this to avoid the worst of it:
It isn't a bug but a deliberate change. It'll take a future patch to introduce a CVar to allow fine-tuning of adjustment speed. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/763413605844865025


Legion - Mechanized Lumber Extractor
The Mechanized Lumber Extractor http://www.wowdb.com/items/140500-mechanized-lumber-extractor mount is a reward of the Remember to Share http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11176-remember-to-share achievement for collecting 300 toys. If you don't want to collect all of those toys, the Sky Golem http://www.wowdb.com/items/95416-sky-golem is a very similar option.
