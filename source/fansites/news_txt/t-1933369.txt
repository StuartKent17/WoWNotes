Legion - Vol'jin
We found some interesting references to a conversation involving Vol'jin. Unfortunately there isn't much more than what is below yet. Keep in mind that this is just a reference in an alpha build of Legion, not something final or officially announced. Spoilers below!

When de time comes, you be ready to fight?
If dis only de beginning, ain't gonna be easy. If we fight, everyone gonna be makin' sacrifices.
Vol'jin...
All your instinct be true. Innocent lives be valued, indeed, but dem magics... Demons we ain't been seein' before. I be fearin' dis only be de beginnin'.
Warchief, I understand, but we cannot afford to send everything we have at the Legion. Some of our people are not ready for a war. It is -
It is unfortunate... for all of us, but the time has come to defend our people - all of our people.
Good. Now we all be seein'... united as one, but we also be need'n an old knowledge. Someone who understand dem fel magics from long ago. Someone ta help understand de fight dey be bringin. Helpin' us prepare... for war.
Warchief, even with the might of the Horde behind us, the Legion's power continues to grow. We know neither their numbers nor their true power, but as you said, we know their intentions.
Yes... and we ain't gone be fightin' de Legion alone. It be time we be reachin' out. I be goin' to visit an old friend.
Dem serious times. Tell your people it's time to be gettin' ready. Everybody gettin' ready.
And what of my guards, Warchief? We cannot afford to leave the city in its state. The Legion is threat enough, and the Alliance - the Alliance will surely strike when our guard is down.
Leave 'em. Dem guards be remindin' us of those we lost. They be remindin' us we be one Horde. And dey be remindin' us - ain't nobody be sittin' down when war be upon us.


Blue Tweets
Character / Items
We have some special-handling in mind for sheathing for things like the fist weapons. They won't be invisible 
Please tell me this hasnt been cut 
Not cut, still in progress. You will see all artifacts during normal play. craig_amai 
Temporarily next alpha build it will not be sheathable at all, which is not the final solution. craig_amai 

Transmogrification
Will we be able to transmog our Artifacts? The artifacts for fury warrior don't really fit my current transmog.
Yes. You will be able to transmogrify your artifacts within the confines of the existing transmog weapon rules. WarcraftDevs 
Will this include transmogging from one artifact to another, I.E. Titanstrike to the bow IF you have the appearances unlocked?
No. Artifact appearances are NOT available as transmogrification options for other weapons or artifacts. WarcraftDevs 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
"Entitlement risk" is a bizarre phrase to use for non-RNG the lack of RNG undermining the concept of "risk".
Yeah I hesitated to use it but it Twitter isn't great for nuance. OccupyGStreet 
"Entitlement" can carry connotations for being a spoiled brat, which isn't at all the context I intended. OccupyGStreet 
But when a reward is not very RNG or too tied to very high skill, you can cause players to expect they WILL earn it. OccupyGStreet 
Extreme case: play 10,000 games to win something. The intention may be that makes the reward rare. OccupyGStreet 
Bit the reality may be that you strongly encourage many players to go engage in something that really isn't that fun. OccupyGStreet 
By contrast most players won't farm a 0.001% drop chance. They don't have the expectation that they WILL get the item. OccupyGStreet 
Why is it bad to be able to work reliably toward a goal?
Actual skill challenge or RNG make things rare. Long grinds can make players hate their lives and you. OccupyGStreet 
The goal may be for a small percent of players to achieve a goal or reward, which is also fine. OccupyGStreet 
The risk is if devs naively say "We will make this rare by making it super grindy." OccupyGStreet 
Long term achievable goals can be fun but excessive length to promote scarcity usually doesn't feel good. OccupyGStreet 

Hey GC, what are your thoughts as a Dev on SWTORs level-sync system? Frankly, I LOVE it. I can play any "zone" at any level!
The risk of level sync is if players feel no sense of accomplishment. "Oh, I am level 15 now but so are those rats." OccupyGStreet 
Not saying SWTOR has this problem and it's not an Achilles' heel problem, just a consideration. OccupyGStreet 


Computers - Setup of the Month
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices  are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. New GPUs may be coming towards the middle of this year

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 6700K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date. Don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions!
