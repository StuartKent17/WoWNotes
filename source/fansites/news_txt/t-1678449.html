Patch 6.1 - Character Model Changes<br>
Patch 6.1 has fixed bugs, improved models, changed the male Night Elf run animation, and restored some things that were missing from the new character models like spots on Female Tauren, extra eye glow on some Undead Faces, eyeliner from Human Females, excessive eye sagging on Female Gnomes and more. A sample of what has been discovered so far is below.<br>

Patch 6.1 - Heirlooms Tab<br>
The long awaited heirlooms tab is finally live in Patch 6.1!<br>
<br>
<br>
Heirlooms now scale from 1 to 60 (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=19445&amp;filter-ilvl-min=85&amp;filter-ilvl-max=85&amp;filter-quality=128)<br>
Heirlooms can be purchased for gold<br>
The new heirlooms can be upgraded by items like Ancient Heirloom Scabbard (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/122339-ancient-heirloom-scabbard) and Timeworn Heirloom Scabbard (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/122341-timeworn-heirloom-scabbard) to Level 90 and Level 100.<br>
Currently, only the Level 90 upgrade is available for purchase and it only upgrades the heirloom to Level 85.<br>
The old heirlooms haven&apos;t changed, but with character copy down we aren&apos;t sure what will happen to them.<br>
Upon logging on to another character, you can click the heirloom to create one for that character. <br>
Any enchants applied are only applied to that copy of the item and lost upon deleting it.<br>
Heirlooms are still Bind on Account, so you can mail enchanted heirlooms between characters.<br>
<br>

Patch 6.1 - Garrison UI: Mission Remaining Duration<br>

Current PTR Status 1/12/15<br>
Hi folks,<br>
<br>
Just wanted to share some early information regarding the 6.1 PTR. <br>
<br>
Note: this information is subject to change as plans are implemented. I&apos;ll update this thread or make a new one as I receive more information.<br>
<br>
<br>
PTR Accounts and realms are currently locked to Mists of Pandaria. Upgrading the PTR accounts to Warlords is a lengthy process so I don&apos;t have an exact ETA, but it&apos;s something we&apos;re actively working on. In-game Character Copy is currently offline. The plan is still to use the in-game system as opposed to the old website version (which hasn&apos;t been functional since 5.4). Characters were wiped after the 6.0.3 PTR realms were brought down last month, and cannot be retrieved at this time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Patch 6.1 - Death Recap UI<br>
Patch 6.1 will give players a little bit more information about how they died in the default UI.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;gallery-61deathrecap&quot;&gt;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/january/thumb/deathRecap.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/january/deathRecap.jpg) &lt;/div&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Patch 6.1 - Twitter UI<br>
The toggle for the Twitter integration is in, but it is currently broken. <br>
<br>
<br>
