Throughout the discussions regarding Azerite Armor, there&#x2019;s been a lot of talk about how you earn Azerite pieces from Mythic+ dungeons. Players have told us &#x2013; and we agree &#x2013; that the process of earning Azerite Armor through Mythic+ feels overly based on luck, and that there isn&#x2019;t enough control in the players&#x2019; hands. Even with our bad luck protection systems in place, the sheer number of potential Azerite pieces you can get from the weekly chest means that trying to get ahold of a specific piece feels hopeless.<br>
<br>
That&#x2019;s a problem we want to solve, and give you some control over the Azerite gear you earn through Mythic+. So here&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re working on for Tides of Vengeance:<br>
<br>
First, we&#x2019;re adding a new (as yet unnamed) currency, which you&#x2019;ll earn from your weekly Mythic+ chest as well as from scrapping (or disenchanting) epic-quality Azerite Armor. This currency is rewarded in addition to the item in the chest (which can no longer be an Azerite piece), and the amount you earn will scale up based on the highest level Keystone you&#x2019;ve completed. For example, completing a level 10 Keystone will reward you with about three times as much as clearing a level 7. Similarly, scrapping higher-item-level Azerite pieces will give you significantly higher amounts of this currency than lower-level pieces.<br>
<br>
To spend that currency, we&#x2019;re bringing back an old friend: Thaumaturge Vashreen. He&#x2019;ll have two main types of items for sale. The first are caches that reward a random dungeon Azerite Armor piece for a given slot (helm, shoulders, or chest). They&#x2019;ll be separated out by item level as well (at 355, 370, and 385), with higher item level caches requiring significantly more currency to purchase.<br>
<br>
But we recognize that with six or more options per slot, this may still not be enough control for high-end players who want to be able to work towards a specific piece that perfectly complements their build. Thus, Vashreen will also offer Item Level 385 versions of the specific dungeon Azerite Armor pieces for each class, sold at a premium.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re still nailing down the exact numbers, but our goal for tuning this new currency is that you&#x2019;ll be able to purchase one of the Azerite caches that lines up roughly with the item level of the gear you&#x2019;re getting from your Mythic+ runs every two or three weeks, with the specific 385 pieces as long-term goals for top players.<br>
<br>
Overall, we believe that this change will improve things in a lot of different ways:<br>
<br>
Mythic+ players of all skill levels will now have a clear path to upgrading their Azerite slots High-end Mythic+ players will have a way to target specific Azerite pieces to optimize their setups Duplicate or unwanted Azerite pieces from other sources (such as raiding) now have some additional value The piece of gear in your weekly chest will have a more reliable item level <br>
<br>
You should see all of this hitting the Tides of Vengeance PTR sometime in the next week or so. We really do appreciate your feedback, and believe that this, in addition to the new traits and other improvements coming to the Azerite system in Tides of Vengeance, will help ease a lot of the concerns about Azerite Armor in Mythic+ and as a whole.</div></div>
