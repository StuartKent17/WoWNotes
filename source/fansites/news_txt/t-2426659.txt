Darkmoon Faire Profession Skillups
As Dalbozz has stated, these quests currently only increase the base or "Vanilla" level of a profession, up to a skill of 300. For more information please see the relevant support article that we created for this question:

With the profession changes in patch 8.0.1, Darkmoon Faire profession quests will only increase the base level of a profession up to a skill of 300. While this is an intended change we are looking to improve this experience in a future patch. If you have feedback regarding this change please submit a suggestion.
