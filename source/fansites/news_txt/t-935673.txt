Congratulations to the entire guild for an impressive achievement, and for spending so much time with nemex http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/551976-nemex without eventually deciding to kill him. I know I would.

New Official Website Feature - Companions and Mounts
Totally missed that blue post earlier this week, you can now track your mounts and pets on the official website! You can now go to the Companions & Mounts tab of your profile to get a list of all the mounts and companion pets you currently own + the ones you don't have yet! 

The list also includes a couple of filters, a small modelviewer, and information on where to get the ones you're missing!

We recently updated the character profile system with a brand new feature to help you track your loyal companion pets and stalwart mounts.

A visit to your character profile will reveal a new heading entitled “Companions & Mounts.” There you’ll find a complete list of in-game pets and mounts that your character can discover throughout Azeroth and beyond. The list is conveniently divided between those that your character has already collected, and those that you have yet to find.

Still pursuing a particular pet? Mad for a magnificent mount? Just mouse over the object of your desire in the Companions & Mounts page and you’ll see information that should help make your next hunt a success. You can filter the results to make it easier to find pets and mounts from a particular source, or sort them by rarity to help you plan future collecting expeditions.

The update is live, so head on over to your character profile to visit your pals right now!
