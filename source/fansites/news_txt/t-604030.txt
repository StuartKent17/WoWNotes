World of Warcraft 2008 - Wrath of the Lich King
The post is cancelled ! Well, actually no, but I realized that a simple compilation wouldn't work and it's almost impossible to provide details on everything without dedicated pages adding screenshots for each zone, summaries, etc .... That's why I started working seriously on the Wrath of the Lich King part of the site I didn't really plan to do it so early and depending on how well it goes it could be released soon. I'm not giving any date for the moment because it's better to not do the same error twice. ^^

Again, I apologize for not publishing it on time but I didn't want to release something incomplete just for the sake of respecting the schedule. Deadlines are like gnomes on the edge of a cliff, you always end up pushing them


Illegal Danish 2 released tomorrow
I know a lot of people are fans of Illegal Danish - Super Snacks, they will probably be happy to hear this : Illegal Danish 2 - Escape from Orgrimmar will be released tomorrow ! Your best chance to catch it as soon as it's released is probably to check the author's site Myndflame.com  every few hours tomorrow. 

If you never heard about the first movie is it possible ?, you can check it on Warcraftmovies  or directly watch the Stage6 Stream 





World of Warcraft - Clay dolls
Via MMOSite.com ,1.shtml A chinese girl made some pretty impressive dolls from clay, and posted the images on her blog. The ones below are only a few of the images available on her blog and you should really visit it if you like her work. Just browse the articles by going through the pages at the bottom, and click the title of the ones with a clay doll in it to see more details
