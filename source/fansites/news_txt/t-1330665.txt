Flex Difficulty Feedback
Flex difficulty needs more testing and feedback http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/266125-feedback-the-underhold-flexible/, so be sure to give it a try if you have time this weekend!
Many thanks for the excellent feedback thus far.

On Malkorok in particular, a bit more breathing room between the final Implosions and Breath wouldn't hurt on Normal as well, and Blood Rage is actually doing more damage than it should be for our current Flexible tuning a bug.

As for Flexible mode in general, we'll be reducing the overall difficulty relative to Normal across the board for our next PTR test. It's also quite possible likely, even that specific mechanics are overtuned on Normal as well, which will of course translate to excessive difficulty on Flexible as well -- we don't consider our Normal mode tuning final yet by any means. 

I'd like to briefly clarify Flexible mode's target audience and what that means regarding how we tune the content: Flexible mode is primarily for roughly the audience served by 10-player Normal raiding in Wrath of the Lich King 10 Normal used to be a tier lower than 25 Normal. Not every guild that raids is a raiding guild, if that makes sense. I'd say that Flexible mode is for social groups that raid; Normal mode is for raiding guilds and Heroic is for hardcore raiding guilds. That distinction consists of factors such as whether or not the group will ever recruit based on class needs, or remove someone based on performance or even openly criticize them. 

But a friends-and-family group is far from a ragtag pickup group. We're assuming that you have a leader running the show, are communicating, and are willing and able to coordinate a strategy and execute individual mechanics. Also, unlike Looking For Raid, which has a relatively flat difficulty level and which is designed to be successfully completed by all appropriately-geared players, Flexible mode entails progression. You'll learn and farm earlier fights to work your way up towards the more demanding ones deeper in the zone. A boss like Malkorok is Boss 9 of 14, and is generally designed as such. I'd compare him to bosses like Rotface or Festergut in Icecrown Citadel. Those certainly saw plenty of PUG action later in the 3.3 patch cycle, when the zone-wide Icecrown buff had ramped up a bit and the strategies were widely-known. 

Now, will players form PUGs for Flexible Siege of Orgrimmar? Absolutely -- and we're excited at the prospect. But that's an organic process that will evolve over time, if we get the tuning right. I don't recall very many Trade chat PUGs waltzing into Icecrown Citadel in January 2010 and killing Festergut.


Blue Tweets
Legendary Cloak
In vanilla and every expansion before MoP we had legendary weapons to anticipate. Why isnt there any in MoP?
Weren't happy with the entitlement feel of DWrath and Fangs. If we do leg weapons again, we'd likely make them much rarer. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351125712259915776
Either forget legendaries, or accept that people want OP items, and OP for some means unbalance so make it easy..
Legendary weapons are kind of OP by their nature. That's fine. Last few we just made it so every potential user could get. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352099651396173825

I am thoroughly disappointed with the legendary being a cloak. All of this work throughout the xpac and we don't use it again.
What do you mean by "don't use it again?" Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350646916398325760
it disapp. me that now there's a leg. for everyone and it's a cloak thats shaped like a towel and clips models. Why no weapon?
We feel like we've done that a lot before. We want to keep things fresh. When rewards are too predictable they get boring. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350652781041946624
Precedent is the problem. Ppl expected awesome weapons. Disappointed by dish towels however awesome they may be
Imagine the problems with this sentence: "I can easily predict what WoW will do next based on precedence." Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350700084620570625

Also is the proc. from the Tanking Cloaks working while in a DPS spec ?
No, you'll have to be a legit tank to benefit from the tank proc. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356121649013207040

Why gate the new world boss using the legendary cape? Seems arbitrary and bad for alts.
I still struggle to understand wanting lots of alts but not having to play them as much as a main. Isn't that the point of an alt? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351121156637605890

Reforging
And yet you think about changing reforging or even removing it.
My experience is that most players just use an add on or website to tell them how to reforge. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362079429914132480
It probably works the best for healers, since sufficient regen is a feel thing, not something you can dictate. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362079614983610371

I do like reforging to make poor items haste trink for fury war easier to swallow. I donâ€™t like it for hit/exp though.
Yeah, the cascades where getting one new item causes you to reforge all are the worst. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361995756040761344
Do you think it's more of a hit/exp-as-a-capped-stat issue then?
Certainly part of it, but we also don't like all the work that has to go into a drop before it's ready to wear. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362076733450625024
Aren't enchants and gems and valor upgrades and maybe transmog enough? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362076838190792704

Characters / Items
how do you feel having Pandaren shared between both factions has worked out? Would you do the same if new races were added?
Not a fan of it overall. We just didn't want to deny anyone Pandaren. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/360765802590384129

Was creating a humam char yday, all faces look awful! Compared with mop/cata races... new models can't get here fast enough.
Yep. Pretty much. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357514707642486784

Can you please explain to me why the tier sets for tier 16 look so bland and tasteless? & why season 14 rogue looks like plate
Response to tier art is so ridiculously subjective that I long ago gave up trying to understand player reaction to it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356126100293812226
The advice I gave before is provide feedback on the kind of designs you'd like to see for future tiers and not just shout BAD. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356126257823494145

Is the current Challenge Mode gear still going to be attainable next exp, or will it go away for good??
Current plan is you can still try to obtain it since it scales your gear. Not 100% sure though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355396072862003200

Random question, Do you think you'll ever have 8 set bonuses again?
I think it's unlikely in PvE. I'm not a fan of players ignoring all pieces except tier sets. Makes loot less interesting. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351133238955212800

What is your opinion on the fact that when everyone can get 'Epics' the term 'Epic' is cheapened.
I feel like some of that is just standard mudflation. Would earning your way from blues to epics feel the same after 9 years? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350707829054767104

of course they can be, but blizz prefers to ignore the storage space issue. Be lucky to see a fix even next xpac.
We aren't ignoring it. We just don't believe near infinite storage is necessary. We don't like e.g. 100 slot bags. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361063871890468864

PTR notes: RPPM proc rates for items that proc haste, wont benefit from haste to proc more?? huh?
The interaction of RPPM with haste made those mechanics more powerful than intended. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363733532511703040
We had cases where RPPM trinkets were a 10%+ damage increase and situations where no non-RPPM trinket would ever compete. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363733719732854784

Any chance of Void Storage ever having the deposit cost removed? That's why I never use it. Withdraw makes more sense.
Transmog was originally conceived as a way to wear older tier sets. It has grown into much more though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362008458972774400
Given that, we don't think the current UI necessarily supports the feature as well as it could. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362008606356414464


Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/august/ssdgraph.gif are stable, with most SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale.

The new Haswell CPUs from Intel are here http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1 and they run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&tag=mmochamp-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A or H90 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4OCWDE?ie=UTF8&tag=mmochamp-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00B4OCWDE. 

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx and Nvidia http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us drivers up to date.
