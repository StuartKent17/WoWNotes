Blue Tweets
Classes
Thought: cleave dps useless in some fights; cleave healing useful much more often. Will all cleave gear be given to healers?
That's something that we agree is a problem. We're considering solutions, but aren't ready to announce anything quite yet. Source 

Art
Any chance you guys will add a depth of field effect to WoW's engine?
Gone back and forth for a while now. I usually turn it off in other games in favor of visibility, value vs. investment situation. Source 

Could Death Knights get options for complexions like Razuvious' and the other DKs in Nax? Pale with dark tattoos?
This falls into the custom skins category, something I'd love to get in. Thanks for the suggestion! Source 

Hope to have update and new visuals for you all at beginning of new year-new stuff is looking even better than what we've already shown! Source 
Your work so far is superb. Stoked to see what's in store. Give me Trolls please! Big muscular ones, tired of being skinny!
I hear that Troll Growth Hormone tgh can help with that. Source 
jungle trolls were never muscular,check your facts. Plz dont change the trolls that ppl been playing for years
we won't dramatically change what exists now. Maybe a future option if we're able to add that level of customization Source 

Character / Items
Reforging makes one less reliant on bis and less gear is sharded.
Remember, you have a significantly wider array of gear available than before. Reforging also made all gear feel more the same. Source 

DOn't know if this has been asked or not but, when i switch spec and an armor piece has a gem in it will it vanish?
No. It won't change what the gem is. Source 
Is this by design or technical limitation?
By design. Source 
Doesn't this favor using secondary gems if not min maxing/not a class that has primary stat=primary staint/intt between specs?
There are no more primary stat gems. Only secondary stat gems. Source 

Simple question. Yes or No. Will Sockets ONLY exist via Bonus?
Still undecided for sure, but at least the vast majority of sockets will be via bonus. Source 

I don't think it was ever mentioned - will it be possible to enchant or gem Tertiary stats in WoD?
Gem, no. Enchant... Not sure, but unlikely, other than perhaps continuing to have Speed to Boots, as has been traditional. Source 
Since the boot speed enchant is mandatory, why not just increase baseline speed and trim boot enchants?
you may be surprised how "mandatory" it is to most people. Personally, I'm pleased that it's as popular as it is. Source 

Warlords of Draenor Stats
Not really for palay for monk. Some stats are poor some are good. Readiness is extremely black or white though.
No, it's not that black and white. We'll put enough on it to tune it. There's room between 'best stat' and 'useless'. Source 
When it comes to Readiness if intended for big CD's not much if any room between "best" and "useless"
Completely false. We can tune its coefficient and what abilities it affects. Very granular. Source 

900 Readiness required encounter because you need X min DA/BoP. Screw using best gear, gotta use that 40ilvl less trinket. 2/2
There will be certain amounts of readiness that you want for certain situations, but that will be highly situational. Source 

so cooldown reduction will only effect the same spells said trinkets effect? or could we see rotations affected?
May be different spells than the trinkets. Still generally long CDs. May do rotational abilities where necessary. Source 

Id like clarification on the Dodge.parry change. Is it still going to exist as a base stat or is it removed 100%.
Still exists as a mechanic, but won't be on gear. Source 

Although parry as a stat will be gone, will strength continue to increase chance to parry in WoD?
Yes. Source 

How will the loss of dodge/parry effect monk tanks. We don't rely on armor. Don't want the best tank class to be dumbed down.
It won't. Dodge/Parry are getting removed from gear, not overall. Nothing changes for Monks, who didn't have dodge/parry on gear. Source 

Any plans to make Armor gems a thing in WoD?
Yes. All of the new secondaries will be gemmable. Source 

Warlords of Draenor
quick toy box question: are toy items going to work cross faction like mounts? e.g. Darkspear>Gnomeregan pride if they're in
Not involved w/ that design, but plenty of spells & pets already work that way, so it's likely! Source 

Class Balance
The reactions to tweets in the MMO-C DK community are making me giggle.
Referring to my tweet about them misusing "Scaling"? Yeah.. Such a misunderstood word. Source 
Pro Tip: If you argue that you need buffs, and say that it's because of "scaling" issues, your argument loses credibility. Source 
There are a few exceptions to this, such as deep analysis such as Theck's. But most people use it as an "I feel weak" fallback Source 
Is "I feel weak" necessarily useless? I mean it's not a reason to buff since feeling != actuality and some ppl are bad but...?
No. I'm just saying that "I feel weak" and "I'm weak because scaling" are the same thing. "Scaling" isn't helping your argument. Source 
So, if you do not want us to call that an issue with "scaling", what word would you like us to use to convey that issue?
Trust me, I totally understand how EXACTLY what you describe is the impression you get. Missing piece is all the buffs/nerfs... Source 
...that happened in between. Those likely had as much to do with power changes as the change in ilvl. Source 
I think it's important to remember that I am not, AT ALL, disagreeing with your feeling of weakness. Suggesting feedback types. Source 
So if we don't have a PhD in math we shouldn't post our concerns/opinions. Wow you lost all credibility right there.
Didn't say that at all. Said that you aren't using scaling properly. Feedback still useful. Source 
So key points for using scaling are: Do you provide context? Is it a quantifiable issue? Do you have evidence to support that?
Yep! Source 

It's hard and frustrating to understand them, but we should try and not dismiss them just b/c "scaling"
Not dismissing the feedback, just pointing out that people use "scaling" to make their argument sound credible. Actually opposite. Source 


Fan Concept Art - Diablo Themed Hearthstone
Dexistor posted a very nice mockup of what a Diablo themed Hearthstone could look like!
