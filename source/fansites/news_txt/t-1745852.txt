WoW was never a sandbox MMO. Its framing and "themepark" approach is a big part of why we play it instead of its competitors.
WoW does what it does well, am I'm not inclined to see it reinvented as something it's not. craig_amai https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/579800688307257344
I am interested in seeing the market in general explore other angles though, both as a gamer and as a designer. craig_amai https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/579800792787390464


Fan Concept - Garrisons Mobile App
Sinfonianartist shared http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/2zwg8v/mobile_garrison_proof_of_concept_update/ a mockup of what garrisons could look like http://imgur.com/gallery/H2v6g/ in the mobile app. Keep in mind this is just a fan concept and that developers have said it is very unlikely garrisons will come to the mobile app.
