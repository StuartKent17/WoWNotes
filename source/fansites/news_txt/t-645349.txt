The Algalon the Observer Article  has been updated with all the info gathered yesterday. The achievements were slightly outdated and have been updated as well. 

I also added a small preview of the quest rewards, after going through the game files we know that the rewards of Heroic: All Is Well That Ends Well  are 2 Rings and 2 Cloaks. Obviously you can only have one
