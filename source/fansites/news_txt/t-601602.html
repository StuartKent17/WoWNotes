<br>
Intent here is: Ship v 2.2.0 with Voice Chat enabled.<br>
<br>
Prerequisite for that to happen: successful testing for a substantial period on PTR.<br>
<br>
Plans can sometimes change when things happen, but that is our plan at this time of writing. As you know the voice chat feature is not enabled on PTR yet, there is still a level of internal testing and debugging going on that we really need to complete before activating it on PTR.<br>

It seems that we won&apos;t get the patch until a few more weeks.</div></div>
