<br>
About the mages loosing a few stats because they got a tons of armor. I also posted an explanation here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=310.msg1397#msg1397), it should help you understanding why mages are getting nearly the same stats as their season 1 gear. <br>
The item team is looking over the mage set again to verify whether it came in under its stat budget. Any changes that would be made, however, wouldn&#x2019;t be ready or implemented by the time the patch is released and the items are made available. We can&#x2019;t of course guarantee that changes will be made, but if the set turns out to have fewer stat points than intended we&#x2019;ll get it fixed as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
A small fix for people seeing overpriced gear.<br>
For those of you that are seeing inflated prices, can you delete the wowtest folder and re-install the PTR patch to see if the prices are corrected? <br>
<br>
And a &quot;confirmation&quot; of the release date, the June 19/20th.<br>
So far things look good. If there is a delay, we&apos;ll let people know.</div></div>
