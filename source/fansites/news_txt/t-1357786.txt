Classes
So you seem really set on balancing tank damage but ignore the huge healing output differences in 25m heroic content.
Source? Meters are a terrible way to assess healer potency. They work reasonably well for assessing tank DPS. Source 

k what's with the warlock hate after patch release? nerfing 1 class to keep others in check is lame. buff mage huntard instead
We'd have to buff a lot of classes and then likely buff the encounters as well to compensate for all the higher damage. Source 

There's so much focus on getting singletarget dps within 1%, but AoE/cleave feels like there are 50% differences..
I don't think ST at 1% differences and AE at 50% differences are true and they're certainly not goals. Source 
Keep in mind AE varies enormously depending upon duration, number of targets and proximity of targets. Source 
ST is more a function of ramp up time and duration whether sustained or burst matters more on that fight. Source 

Hundreds of constant minor tweaks erode class diversity. Ppl would complain less frequently if you changed less.
Do you think that's true or do you think they would just feel ignored since long-standing problems would go untreated? Source 

I would like to see healing go back to making smart choices and acting upon them. I don't want the game to heal for me.
We agree in general, but how do you solve something like e.g. Atonement or Binding Heal glyph? Source 
By making them poor. Any spell for which the game chooses the targets for you should lose to smart player decisions
Yeah, we think that is a good direction. We'd just need to make sure each healer had a "dumb but smart!" alternative. Source 
I'm not sure casting PW:S on the whole raid or spamming Holy Light/Rejuv were "smart player decisions".
It's hard to imagine AE heals that aren't smart heals unless they are like HRain area based or PoH goofy party based. Source 

"...why play a non dot?" why make a dot spec if multidotting is always going to hold back it's single target dmg?
Class diversity? Why make a non dot spec if your ST damage is always going to hold back your AE? Source 
At least players no longer say "I don't care about AE because that's just for trash." Source 

If a tooltip is starting to get complex, I think it means that ability has too many jobs to do & needs rethinking.
We agree. That is just one of the risk of having too many spells of the design "X replaces Y but with Z extra effect." Source 

sorry meant that most players just want to feel their dps is competitive but not the hardcore min/max definition
I used to think that, but I think today a lot of players look at highest possible DPS even though it barely affects them. Source 
And when I say "a lot" it still probably isn't that many total, but more than it used to be. Source 

The overall problem is you're not even trying to achieve class balance. When you do, then we can have a meaningful discussion.
We aren't trying to have all classes tie in all situations, no. Source 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
BrM nerf = fine, the way you doing it = terrible. You are nerfing our already "bad" 2p as well. Any compensation to our 2p?
The alternative is to nerf monks and then buff WW damage, but that carries a lot more bug risk. Source 
I think it's hard to justify Brewmaster damage being so much higher than other tanks though. Source 

exactly what aspect of revival prior to the 30% nerf broke the game?
The cast time. Source 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
What happened to "take dmg done into calculation for healer balance"? And agree about all smartheals, they need to be limited.
Do you meant Atonement damage done? It's really fine and Atonement healing is fine too. Source 
The deal IMO is that Disc can shift so effortlessly into that role whenever you don't need a lot of healing. Source 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
- In all fairness and honesty, PvE Warlocks probably wouldn't be hurt too terribly with another nerf or two. - A PvE Warlock
We worry the Affliction nerf isn't large enough, but we'll see how it goes. We try and err on the side of not over-nerfing. Source 

So are you gonna talk about the agony 15% stealth nerf? or is that going to be what must not be named?
It's not intended as a stealth nerf. The hotfix notes just haven't caught up yet. Affliction DPS was still too high. Source 
Call it w.e you want. In most players eyes, it's a blatant nerf. Did you honestly think players wouldn't notice?
If they didn't, they would when the hotfix notes went out for the day. Stealth nerfs serve no purpose; players will figure it out. Source 

yet that becomes a basis for damage too high, I think youre over nerfing here.
What current fight would you consider warlocks to be weak on? Source 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
So warriors socket straight crit as arms or fury, yet you took away their static crit buff...why?
The intent of group buffs is that individuals can make the group stronger, not that individuals can be very self sufficient. Source 

What about rage from damage taken? what was the reasoning for removing that?
For tanks, it made offtanking rough. For PvP, it made not getting attacked rough. For PvE DPS it meant standing in fires. Source 
We tried to capture some of the feel with Berserker Stance, which isn't quite there yet, but is pretty close. Source 

Professions
Do you —master of all UIs— think that the profession panel could display the breakdown of ingredients? #craftingnoodlecarts
Could the profession UI suck less? Absolutely. What do you mean by breakdown specifically? Source 

Wondered if you've ever considered account-wide professions? With alts so prevalent is the 2 per char limit still useful?
Would love to see more discussion on this topic from players. Alts are cool, but alts just to get around the prof limit bug me. Source 


Poll: Alts for Professions
One of this week's Blue Tweets talked about  creating alts just to have access to more professions. Have you created alts that are mostly just to have access to more professions?

Poll #2: Alts for Professions
Ghostcrawler posed a followup question  about how much fun having the profession alts is. Useful feedback is always welcome in the comments!
