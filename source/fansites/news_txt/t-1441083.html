Upcoming Siege of Orgrimmar Changes<br>
You can see Heroic progression in our recent news post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3678-Armory-Stats-Heroic-SoO-Progression-Blizzard-CS-Callback-Blue-Tweets-Fan-Art). <br>
Effective with next week&#x2019;s raid resets, we will be making some targeted difficulty adjustments to a few encounters in Siege of Orgrimmar. Overall, the difficulty curve in Siege has met our expectations, and while there are some major challenges deep in Garrosh&#x2019;s sanctum, we see raid groups continuing to make steady progress at all levels. However, there are a handful of encounters at specific sizes/difficulties that present a disproportionate jump in challenge, and so we&#x2019;re making some adjustments to smooth out the difficulty curve overall. We wanted to provide a bit of advance notice, both for guilds that are extremely close to kills and want to get in under the wire with the coveted &#x201C;pre-nerf&#x201D; kill, and to provide some hope to those who are looking at the wall ahead of them and despairing.<br>
<br>
Galakras<br>
We will be reducing the health of the Kor&#x2019;kron troops in 10-player Normal and Flexible difficulty, because smaller raid groups have fewer tools to deal with the various enemies, and are further impacted when a portion of the raid must break off to deal with towers. No changes to Heroic difficulty at this time.<br>
<br>
Thok the Bloodthirsty<br>
We will reduce Thok&#x2019;s unavoidable Fearsome Roar and Shock Blast damage in 10-player Normal, Heroic, and Flexible mode &#x2013; again, smaller raid groups have fewer raid cooldowns to handle the increasing damage as Acceleration ramps, and we&#x2019;re seeing 10-player and smaller Flex groups having much more difficulty with this encounter than their 25-player counterparts.<br>
<br>
Siegecrafter Blackfuse<br>
This encounter&#x2019;s Heroic mode is a huge step up in difficulty from the preceding 11 bosses. We&#x2019;re looking to smooth out that spike somewhat, while still keeping the fight quite challenging. The following changes apply only to Heroic difficulty: We are reducing the unavoidable raidwide damage inflicted by Magnetic Crush and Shredders&#x2019; Overload, as well as the damage from Superheated (to make belt groups&#x2019; lives a bit less painful when an Overcharged Laser is active). We&#x2019;re also reducing Disassembled Turret health. Finally, on 10-player Heroic only, we&#x2019;re reducing the health of Crawler Mines, since 10-player raids have fewer available tools to keep them controlled.<br>
<br>
Paragons of the Klaxxi<br>
Moving on to Heroic Paragons, we&#x2019;d like them to continue a steady increase in difficulty that culminates with Garrosh. They&#x2019;re already pretty close to that, so we&#x2019;re just making a couple of tweaks here, reducing the damage of Multi-Shot and Fiery Edge on Heroic difficulty. This should keep most of the coordination difficulty of the fight, but reduce some frustrating deaths due to burst damage interactions between different abilities.<br>
<br>
We have no further changes planned at this time, but we&#x2019;ll continue to monitor players&#x2019; ongoing progress through Siege of Orgrimmar, and may make further adjustments if needed.</div></div>
