Boubouille2007-06-14, 12:23 PMThe PTRs are expected to come down for a patch at approximately 18:00 CEST today. The downtime should not be more than 4 hours.

If we're lucky enough, it means tons of new rewards. 
And if you're waiting for the new stats of the pvp set of your class, seriously, just add 10~15% to the base stats and that's it.
