Blizzard may be getting ready to announce Blizzcon, with an update to the Blizzcon site that has since been reverted, including this information:<br>
BlizzCon is an epic celebration of Blizzard Entertainment&apos;s game universes and the global player communities that bring them to life. <br>
<br>
This year marks the 10th BlizzCon and Blizzard&apos;s 25th anniversary&#x2014;we&#x2019;d love for you to join us in celebrating these milestones together at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California on Friday, November 4 and Saturday, November 5, 2016.</div></div>
