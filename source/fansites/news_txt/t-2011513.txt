Legion - Fishing Artifact
Legion adds the Underlight Angler , which has a tree of artifact traits  that gives you access to traits like:


Undercurrent  - Teleport to the nearest fishing node.
Fishrender's Blessing  - Become a fish when underwater, allowing you to breathe water and swim rapidly
Surface Tension  - Walk on water.
Luremaster  - Increases duration of Legion lures and baits
Bloodfishing  - Grants a chance to catch Blood of Sargeras  when fishing in the Broken Isles
Better Luck Next Time  - Grants a chance to catch boots when fishing in the Broken Isles
Fishbane  - Increases autoattack damage done to aquatic beasts


Prerequisites

Bigger Fish to Fry  - Catch all of the rare Legion fish
The Wish Remover  - Fish up all of the coins from Dalaran's fountain
Fishing skill at 800


Acquisition

Soon after meeting the prerequisites, you will fish up the Luminous Pearl 
You then take the Pearl to Khadgar 
Khadgar gives you a pat on the head  and tells you to put in in the Dalaran fountain.
Nat Pagle appears in the fountain with a quest for you , sending you to a Val'sharah scenario to look at the fish frenzy going on:

Kill Murlocs - Slay all of the murlocs on the island.
Fishing - Fish up the Gloaming Frenzies.
Delivery - Give Nat your Gloaming Frenzies.
What's below? - Fish up what's been disturbing the frenzies.
Mglrrp - Slay Mglrrp.

After slaying Mglrrp, Nat realizes that part of him would make a great fishing pole. 
The pearl you fished up is used as an Artifact forge that doesn't appear to be working correctly right now.
Leveling up the Artifact requires you to equip the Underlight Angler and catch rare fish that grant Artifact Experience beta.wowdb.com/spells/221474-throw-back#related:used-by-item;_!.

Weekly Legion Developer Q&As Starting This Thursday!
The time of the Burning Legion’s return is fast approaching, and as we begin our final preparations, we thought it’d be a good time to start up a new series of live developer Q&A sessions!

Every Thursday for the next several weeks, starting at 11 a.m. PT, we’ll be going live on Twitch.tv/Warcraft  to answer questions submitted by the World of Warcraft community. Each week will feature a different developer, and we’ll be looking for questions that focus on their particular role on the World of Warcraft development team.

To kick things off, we’re starting with Assistant Game Director Ion “Watcher” Hazzikostas. Ion is involved in nearly every aspect of World of Warcraft development, so for this session, feel free to submit questions on any aspect of the Legion expansion. You can do so by posting in this forum thread  or via Twitter using the hashtag #LegionQA.

We’re really looking forward to getting the chance to dive in and answer as much as we can, so we hope to see you Thursday at 11 a.m. PT!
