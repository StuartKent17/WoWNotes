Venturebeat broke the news earlier today (http://venturebeat.com/2013/05/28/blizzard-delays-unannounced-mmo-until-2016-resets-whole-project-exclusive/) that Titan has been &quot;reset&quot; and will be delayed until at least 2016. The decision was announced to employees a couple of days ago and sources close to the project gave us more details on the subject:<br>
<br>
<br>
Blizzard felt that Titan wasn&apos;t going in the right direction and decided to make significant technological and design changes to the game. This happened in the past with Starcraft and Warcraft 3.<br>
A smaller dev team will be in charge of redesigning the project and about 60 or 70 developers are being moved to other teams (WoW, Blizzard All-Stars, Diablo 3 expansion, Battle.net)<br>
<br>
<br>
Blizzard didn&apos;t officially comment on the subject yet, hopefully this is a step in the right direction and Titan won&apos;t have the same fate as Starcraft: Ghost.</div></div>
