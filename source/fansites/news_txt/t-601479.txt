The hot fix has now been properly pushed.

Remember yesterday's hotfix concerning the [item=24053,wh] pattern in Halaa ... Well, it doesn't work. At least on european servers

Ok, looks like the hot fix didn't take, we're looking into what happened. As soon as I get some more information I will let you know.
