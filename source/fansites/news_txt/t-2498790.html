We&#x2019;re working on a change to the Arcane Heart (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/303006-arcane-heart) Azerite Trait that was introduced in Rise of Azshara. How it works today is:<br>
<br>
Arcane Heart (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/303006-arcane-heart) gives you a buff for every 1.5 million damage or healing you do. However, damage or healing that comes from something other than you casting a spell is not counted. For example, a Blood Death Knight doing healing from Death Strike isn&#x2019;t benefitting from that healing counting to the next proc of Arcane Heart.<br>
<br>
So we&#x2019;re developing a fix for that. Currently, the change looks like this:<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Heart of Azeroth<br>
<br>
Arcane Heart (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/303006-arcane-heart)<br>
<br>
Fixed a bug that caused some damage and healing effects to go uncounted by this Azerite Trait.<br>
Damage and healing counted to activate Omnipotence is no longer counted while Omnipotence is active.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The second change there is needed to keep this from being a big buff for a Trait that we feel is fairly well-balanced before we make the bugfix.<br>
<br>
If all goes well, we expect to bring this fix to the game with maintenance this week (tomorrow for Americas realms, and thereafter for EU and Asian realms).</div></div>
