Instead the rewards seemed to be sent to some teams while others only received lower ranking titles.<br>
<br>
At this time it only appears to have affected select realms. Since then we&#x2019;ve been able to determine that the issue was specifically an error in rewarding teams appropriately. We&#x2019;re currently in the process of testing a fix, using data recorded from when the realms were brought down for maintenance to determine if this fix will correct the issue.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re waiting for the fix to be tested before discussing how the issue will be resolved as we simply don&apos;t know what the best available course of action we can take is until we have a working solution.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll be providing further updates in this thread as we&#x2019;re able.<br>
