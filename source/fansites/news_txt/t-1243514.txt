Character
Did devs take into consideration how cost prohibitive upgrading is? its next to impossible to fully upgrade your BiS slots.
One can argue maybe the game was better when everyone didn't have the expectation of BiS in every slot... Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279061311256666112

is it safe to say brawlers guild may promote gold buying as people who may not have time to farm gold would wanna try it out?
Gold farming sucks, but we can't be terrified about having a gold economy in the game. Gold having no value sucks too. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274966108975538176

Do you think that the visual design of abilities and gear influences which classes are more popular and most played?
Absolutely. Maybe not for everyone but I believe it contributes a lot. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277535605859180544

Getting a bit of gear is too complicated; enchant, gem, reforge all of your gear and now upgrade. Gem & Ench only was good.
We actually agree with this. Once upon a time you got to put on the gear that dropped when it dropped. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276504529900539904
Amen. Please remove reforging. Also eliminates need to go to external sites to tell you how exactly to reforge.
We think reforging feels fine for everything except hit and expertise. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276777723953823745
If you agree, why did you just bring in the upgrade system the other week?
You don't need to upgrade a piece to wear it. You do need to enchant, gem and reforge. Reforge may be the biggest problem. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276752871893127168

last question, did you even consider letting people focus on whatever aspect they enjoy most to progress?
Within reason. E.g. you can't do achievement to progress. Also what you enjoy may be supported but may not be most efficient. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276776274217816064

How is the new race models going along? It's the only thing that is gonna get me back. Anything more than Dwarf and Orc done?
We're excited about them but it's hard to say much more without every word getting over-analyzed. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279648672424280064
OMG, GC said new models will be amazing and perfect and are almost done!!! /sarcasm
Exactly. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279659059832053760

.What makes it worse is talents actually at 0% use because either one talent was to well designed or others suck.
Warrior talent diversity isn't actually bad, with a couple of exceptions like Second Wind. Mage talent diversity is too low. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279405268570365952
the only pve fight that any competitive fury warrior will use storm bolt for is garalon. Balanced?
No, we think it's a little weak in both PvE and PvP. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279652795735498752

Just curious as to why we have the mechanic that sets mana to zero when switching specs? 
If the switching cost is too low then it feels like you are supposed to do so every pull, especially for healers. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279404059876806656

PvP
Opinion on double healer comps in 3v3? Should they be viable? Saw 2600 double healer frost mage before today's Frost Bomb nerf
We are generally fine with non-standard comps as long as they are somewhat uncommon. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279018793026613248

Greg, It looks like you are giving burst classes more advantages than dot classes with the mass PvP Power and 1 min trinket
More frequent small bursts is generally a nerf to burst strategies. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279648353472626688
you explain the nerf part, Please ?
It is generally easier to counter being hit twice for 200K with a short break in between than one hit for 400K. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279657418059837440

Wondering if you're aware of the current talk in arena: feral is OP, frost mage is dead, and healers are too weak; comment?
Feral does seem to be at the top of everyone's hit list now that mage, warrior and hunter are toned down. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279655564290686976

I love how Druids can vanish and ShStep BETTER than rogues and about 6x more often... kudos man. you are a master of balance.
One ability compared to another ability doesn't scale to one class' comparison to another. It's about the whole package. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279405596879495168

do u think melee damage is out of control atm? specifically feral/dk/warrior... esp w/ healing debuff its just unhealable...
Feral, maybe. DK no. Warriors have been nerfed a ton lately. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279063460069928960

prot warrior stands and lets me get him to 35%, kills me rogue. Having a fantastic time. What class do you want me to play?
Tanks aren't designed to be killed. That's why we don't push them into Arenas. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279064488735543296

me and a lot of healers need to be talked off a ledge. I'm sure there's a reason behind the changes we just aren't seeing.
Strategically, burst and perma CC are the only options when healers can keep everyone up. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279062090122153984
Disc priest anyone? Oh nevermind, they dont exist in arena anymore thanks to lazy blanket nerfs.
When healing is too powerful overall, the solution is not to let some specs still have healing that is too powerful. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279644822099337216

UI / Addons
hey - is there some sort of UI notice to tell you *if* you bought the extra rep for a faction?
There is not, but we agree that we need to add one. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274968626212249602

the issue isn't mods changing talents, its the ui becoming broken because of unrelated taint caused by blizzard ui bugs
I'll say again, taint = accessing something we want protected. We can decide to make it !protected, but that does take some work. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278687874059223041
- The problem is it can be reproduced without any mod's. Which should be addressed. Global variable is tainting.
There isn't much technical distinction between mods and macros. You're still trying to access something we want to protect. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278618814776758272

Please stop being so restrictive about the Glyph/Talent UI. It's driving people nuts, I loathe the moment I have to change!
Philosophically, we don't want automating talent or glyph swaps. Once it's easy to reglyph every pull, players feel like they must. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278572849529245697

He's Lead Systems Designer. A lot of people take for granted exactly what "systems" entails in game design.
Balance is a pretty small portion of what I do. It's just one many forum posters / twitter users care a lot about. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275738454111973376
What's the big portion of what you do?
Future planning, UI, and then just pure people management take the biggest portion. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275765732439126016
For UI, do you work on the backend of making things work, user end experience, or something else?
I design UI from the PoV of features and goals. We have actual graphic designers also and then engineers to hook it all up. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275771943557419008
Do you sometimes feel that WoW's UI is getting over-complicated? I often can't find stuff after 7 years...
Yes, I do. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275981711358193667
