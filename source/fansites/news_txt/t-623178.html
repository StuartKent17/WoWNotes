PvP Zones and Gear<br>
Probably the less up to date pages ... But if you&apos;ve been reading this site for some time you know the basics of Lake Wintergrasp and Strand of the Ancients. The Season 5 gear list is fairly complete.<br>
<br>
You can also check Gotfrag WotLK Coverage (http://www.gotfrag.com/portal/edition/wotlk/)<br>
