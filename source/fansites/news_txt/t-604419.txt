Boubouille2008-01-22, 02:59 PMThe 2.3.3 patch isn't very exciting, but I do have something interesting to post today. If you read my news carefully you probably saw the screenshot of Sunwell loots I posted a few days ago and I probably was the first to publicly claim "LOL FAKE !". 

However, it looked real, too real to not be checked and I spent the week trying to gather information in a few places, and it became very interesting. I can now say that these loots are most likely real, and you will probably see most of them in Sunwell Plateau. 95% chance to see them, I'll keep the 5% chance that they're fake just to feel secure There is obviously no official source to confirm this, but most of you know that I wouldn't post this without a good reason. 

Items seems to be ilvl 154~155
At least one of them is ilvl 164 Apolyon, the Soul-render, we can assume it's a loot from Kil'jaeden. I didn't try to get the ilvl for all items, maybe there are more loots from KJ. 
Even if they're legit, these stats are probably from early beta servers and could be changed/removed once the 2.4 patch is released on PTR. 
The feral staff is with the caster weapons, I know, I'm not redoing the screenshot just because of that. :/
Nothing is confirmed by Blizzard, trust it at your own risks. 
Bonus It seems that the Arena Season 4 sets will be named "Brutal Gladiator". This one is still fairly unconfirmed though.



All these items are from the old screenshot posted a few days ago, I did a clean version to make it more readable. Here you go  ! 

Obviously, that's not all the Sunwell loots, there are many more that we'll be able to discover once the PTR patch is released ... soon ?
