Blizzard PvP Summit<br>
It&apos;s probably worth clarifying why we&apos;re hosting a small, invitational PvP Summit at Blizzard HQ.<br>
<br>
First and foremost, this isn&apos;t a class balance summit. We&apos;re not bringing in these guys to talk about specific tweaks to specific classes for the current season.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re hosting the event to candidly discuss a broad number of subjects with respect to PvP, including reward structures, battleground design, arena design, general PvP content/gameplay, future plans, and yes, we&apos;ll spend some time on class design. These guys aren&apos;t class representatives. They&apos;re highly skilled and knowledgeable players, and we want to have an open, in-person dialog with them about the game. They&apos;ve spent a lot of time scrutinizing World of Warcraft&apos;s PvP content over the years, so we want to get them all in a room for a day and have some focused discussions, debates, hug-it-out sessions, and so on. <br>
<br>
Sam Kwok from Arena Junkies and Olivia Grace from WoW Insider will be reporting on some of the info that&apos;s discussed, though given that we&apos;ll spend a good deal of time on &quot;big picture&quot; ideas, a lot of the information will be confidential in the short term.<br>
<br>

Loot RNG<br>
We realize that sometimes RNG can be frustrating. I&#x2019;m just not sure how beneficial it would be for the game and its longevity, if all of a sudden RNG started being &#x201C;smart&#x201D; and avoiding giving out items that are either useless or redundant to players.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Smart loot&#x201D; is great for quests and lower level content, but messing around with the randomness of loot attribution in high-end content is, in my opinion, something that would only be detrimental to the game.<br>
<br>
LFR already gives out loot that is based on spec, that&#x2019;s as far as we are willing to go with &#x201C;smart&#x201D; RNG in such environments, also, that only happens because of the nature of that specific loot system.<br>
From a design standpoint, it&#x2019;s perfectly ok for loot not always being desirable. Rarity is exciting. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/275670-i-dont-understand-why-you-do-this-blizzard/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8427012734?page=1#20))<br>
<br>
Leveling and Dungeons Too Easy?<br>
Try to remember that, compared to a brand new MMO player, those of you who&apos;ve been gamers for a while and are familiar with games in this genre are bound to find levelling content fairly straight forward. <br>
<br>
Many people pick up WoW as their first MMO, with zero knowledge about the different classes and races, let alone talent specs, skills and attributes. They may not know some of the things you don&apos;t even think about like, as a Mage, you should pick Intellect over Strength, Spirit over Agility. They won&apos;t pick a new class and spend an hour or two looking up rotations or recommended talents, which addons to get, how to enchant, glyph, gem or reforge to get the best from their toon.<br>
<br>
The game has to be forgiving to people like that, while still engaging for those of us who&apos;ve been playing for years, and sure, that must be tricky for the devs at times. But as someone who has always enjoyed levelling new characters, I truly feel the questing nowadays is much more enjoyable than before.<br>
<br>
We understand that for certain individuals the game may at times come across as simplistic and easy compared to X years ago. Yet as Takralus pointed out earlier, it&apos;s important to us that the overall gaming experience is welcoming and fun for newcomers. <br>
<br>
A number of changes were intentionally aimed at breaking down the vast amount of information within WoW, into manageable chunks.<br>
<br>
That being said we&apos;re also keen on creating games with flexibility so they can be played the way players want to. Examples of these would be the flexible raid system or monster power in Diablo. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/275649-leveling-and-dungeons-are-disgrace/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8427632869?page=3#57))<br>

PvP Feedback<br>
In regards to those of you who are raising concerns over the current amount of crowd control that is around right now, we just want to make sure that you&apos;re aware that we will be working to reduce the amount and frequency of crowd control in the next expansion, while also making diminishing returns easier to comprehend. <br>
<br>
One thing to note though is that while we&apos;re aware that it&apos;s not enjoyable to be unable to play your character at times, we also know that it&apos;s quite frustrating to be casting a spell and then suddenly see the word &quot;Immune&quot; come up. We&apos;ll try to provide more information on this particular topic when we&apos;re able.<br>
<br>
At level 70, you get Stampeding Roar. It increases movement speed by 50% for 10 seconds for you and anyone in your party on a 1 minute cooldown. It replaces Dash.<br>
We already actually do this to some degree, but we purposefully only take it so far. Looking specifically at the Dash/Stampeding Roar example, that will actually cause players to hesitate in using Stampeding Roar for their own benefit and instead will only use it when it&apos;d be most efficient for the entire party. Making changes like this can easily start to cause things to get overly complicated. Plus, this doesn&apos;t entirely solve the issue of action bar bloat at max level.<br>
<br>
Keep the feedback coming everyone, this thread is awesome! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/274770-pvp-wishlist-for-60/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8376217610?page=12#240))<br>
