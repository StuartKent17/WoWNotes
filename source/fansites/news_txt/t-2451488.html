Coldlight Surfrunner and Island Expedition Loot Clarifications and Updates<br>
Any new about Coldlight Surfrunner pet from Island Expeditions?is the last pet i miss and yet 0% of player base received it,also 2nd time murloc appear on Whispering Reef,feedback will be appreciated!!<br>
There are different Murloc tribes in Azeroth, and so far, the kind of Murlocs that could drop Coldlight Surfrunner have not appeared on Island Expeditions. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1065000911376773120))<br>
<br>
After our earlier tweet, we are working on a hotfix so that the Coldlight Surfrunner can drop when ANY murloc type is present on an Island Expedition. Furthermore, we&apos;re simplifying this entire system in Tides of Vengeance. More details on that soon. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1065080683058487297))<br>

BfA PvP Season 1 Will Not End on December 11th<br>
As we&#x2019;re now three weeks from beginning the Tides of Vengeance content update, we wanted to make it known that the current PvP Season will not be ending at that time.<br>
<br>
We expect to end the current season in January 2019, and we will provide an exact date for that in a few weeks.</div></div>
