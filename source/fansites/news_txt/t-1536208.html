The gaze of the Black Prince (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/161780-gaze-of-the-black-prince) had been both blessing and curse to her once upon a time. Her journey long and arduous, the blood of the enemy stained her boots. Now she stood on the corpse of the vanquished Fire God &#x2013; Ordos &#x2013; her cloak whipping about her frame and victory beating within her heart. Her journey was at an end. But as with any end, there is always another beginning &#x2018;round the bend.<br>
<br>
To be legendary, one must obtain&#x2013; a truly legendary cloak. What hero is hero without one? To help you on your danger fraught quest, the infamous Black Prince would grant you a boon to help make the journey toward adorning your own cloak a little easier. Will you follow in the footsteps of heroes that have come before and brave the challenge?<br>
