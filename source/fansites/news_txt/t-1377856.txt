Blizzard just trademarked "Warlords of Draenor" in New Zealand. It was then registered in Australia shortly after.

Entertainment services, namely, providing on-line computer games; providing on-line non-downloadable computer games that may be accessed via a global computer network; providing online news and information in the field of computer games.


It's also worth mentioning that warlordsofdraenor.com http://www.warlordsofdraenor.com was registered a month ago. 

I do realize that we had a lot of fun times with trademarks in the past *cough* Dark Below *cough* but let's just say that on a personal level I'm pretty confident about this one. I'll leave the speculation up to you guys until Blizzcon.
