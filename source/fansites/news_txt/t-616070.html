Icecrown/Arthas Cinematic<br>
I don&apos;t really like to spoil lore, and the video below contains A LOT of spoilers. This is the cinematic related to the Arthas/Icecrown storyline, we didn&apos;t really talk about this kind of lore on the front page because I don&apos;t think it&apos;s useful to spoil it, it kinda breaks the fun (especially in WotLK where a lot of work has been done on the lore)<br>
<br>
