Legion Collector&apos;s Edition Mount - Illidari Felstalker<br>
The Illidari Felstalker (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/189998-illidari-felstalker) is the Legion Collector&apos;s Edition Mount. Keep in mind that while it is flagged as a flying mount, there are currently no specific flying animations, so it uses swimming animations. There is no official confirmation that it will be able to fly.<br>
