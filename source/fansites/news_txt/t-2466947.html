On this day, 14 years ago, World of Warcraft released in Europe! <br>
<br>
14 years is a heck of a long time, and I&#x2019;m sure many of you have some fond memories of friendships made, raids not going according to plan, epic PvP victories (or defeats), and maybe even finding a rare mount or two!<br>
<br>
When did you start playing?<br>
<br>
What&#x2019;s your favourite memory of WoW?<br>

Do you remember this screen?<br>

Most of all, THANK YOU for choosing to spend your time in this world (and some short stays on other worlds) over the years!<br>

WoW Classic Updates<br>
Not to split hairs here, but I&#x2019;m far more interested in the decisions that have been made than I am how far along they are in implementing said decisions. I have total confidence in Blizzard to make things happen from a technical perspective. I do have some concerns that the overlords at Acti-Blizz will &#x201C;encourage&#x201D; extras to generate revenue at the expense of authenticity.<br>
Those are some of the coolest conversations I think I&#x2019;ve personally had about the project with the Classic team. As a fanboy I honestly get a little giddy about them. I don&#x2019;t want to overhype them because not a lot of people are that excited about restoring old maps, or UI elements. Like I said before we look forward to sharing more specific details and even some examples of how the team managed to solve some problems that we think are pretty interesting.<br>
<br>
I totally get the concern, but to comfort the thought that comes with that, this isn&#x2019;t a normal project. It&#x2019;s a passion project for you folks that have been diehard Classic fans and have been asking us to provide a real Vanilla server for over 10 years. We know we haven&#x2019;t won over all of you yet, and some are waiting to see a closer final product, but the team is dedicated to trying to pull it off.
