Boubouille2007-10-22, 08:46 AMUpdate : Yes, I know, servers went down, fixed. I wish I could say it won't happen again in the next days but ... I already said that so many times. ^^ Hopefully it should be fixed once and for all soon.

2.3 Set bonuses changes
Two changes I didn't list before
Shaman : Skyshatter Raiment
2 Set: Your Chain Heal ability costs 10% less mana.
Old bonus: Your Lesser Healing Wave ability costs 10% less mana.

Druid : Wildhide - Gladiator set
4 Set: Increases your movement speed by 15% while in Bear, Cat, or Travel Form. Only active outdoors.
Old bonus 2.3 PTR: Reduces the casting time of your Entangling Roots ability by 0.15 sec.


WotLK spells in 2.3 files
Omg ยง WotLK ยง No, seriously, these spells are probably here to make people happy with a WotLK name they know, but this is probably not the final WotLK version, the expansion is still very far from release.
Anyway, they added the famous Death Knight's [spell=42650] [spell=42651], but most of the effect is a server-side script, actually it could be a spell used by a boss in one of the Sunwell Plateau instances.


2.3 Screenshots
The almost daily 2.3 screenshots, this time with an ... interesting addition to christmas event Oh, there is also a [spell=44824] by the way, screenshot here http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/flyingreindeer.jpg. The second one is a screenshot of [item=33993] ! The new pet from Zul'aman, you can get it by using the [item=33865] on frogs in Zul'aman. You won't get the pet everytime, it's a rare loot
