Stood in the Fire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5518/stood-in-the-fire/) Feat of Strength<br>
It&apos;ll be virtually impossible to predict when and where he&apos;ll show up. Deathwing does what he wants. Waiting in a random zone for him to show up is not going to be very effective. It could literally take days for him to hit the zone you&apos;re in. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/134405/deathwing-feat-of-strength-for-dying))<br>

Onyxian Whelpling<br>
It was a pet rewarded to any characters that logged on during the 5th year anniversary. While some special pets are account-wide and mailed on new character creation, the Onyxian Whelpling was not one of them.

Horn of Winter<br>
The behavior you&apos;re describing is the result of a bug which will be fixed in the next patch prior to the release of Cataclysm. You will again be able to toot your own horn to gain runic power, you just won&apos;t get the Attack Power benefit if a similar buff is already present.
