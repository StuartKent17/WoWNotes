Warlords of Draenor Stability Updates<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re continuing to work toward greater realm stability and address the service issues impacting latency. Our current biggest hurdle is the concentration of players in specific areas and zones, and an unexpected effect of that concentration on the realm stability. We&#x2019;re continuing to maintain a lowered realm population cap to help with the stability, which is resulting in increased queue times. We&#x2019;re seeing some increase in individual zones drop which are causing localized player disconnections as we get into primetime in the Americas, and if someone is disconnected they will quite likely run into a queue to log back in. Work is progressing on improving realm stability through fixes targeting individual in-game issues, as well as on the backend game and network services.<br>
<br>
[Update] 8:00 pm PST<br>
<br>
Our top priority continues to be service issues impacting performance and long wait times on North American realms. We recently pushed a server change that caused disconnects, and as a result login services are heavily impacted as players attempt to (re)log in to the game. If you experience issues logging in, please be patient and wait a few minutes before trying again. We&#x2019;re continuing to work to address other stability and latency issues as well as make additional improvements in game performance.<br>
<br>
[Update] 9:00 p.m. PST<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll be performing maintenance on all NA realms beginning at 5 a.m. PST in order to address issues with realm stability. We anticipate this process will last approximately 4 hours and appreciate your patience during this time.<br>

Newly Boosted Characters and Bypassing the Skill Unlock Process<br>
If you&#x2019;ve recently boosted a new level 90 character for Warlords of Draenor, you will start within the blasted lands with a limited number of spells at your disposal. Once you go through the Dark Portal and as you progress through Tanaan Jungle, more spells and abilities will be unlocked. Once you&#x2019;ve completed Tanaan Jungle, you should have most of your spells and abilities (for level 90) available to you. The remaining will be unlocked shortly after the beginning quests in Frostfire Ridge (for Horde) or Shadowmoon Valley (for Alliance). This system has been designed to help players who have newly boosted to ease into their new character.<br>
<br>
If you&#x2019;re a veteran player and are absolutely sure that you want to skip this progression of spells and abilities, you can either swap specs or queue for an instance. This will unlock the remaining spells and abilities for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Garrison Access Issues<br>
We&apos;re tracking a few issues that are impeding access or progression with Garrisons. To address these issues we&apos;ll be restarting some Garrison services which will impact access to the Garrison for some realms. While these restarts progress, this may result in characters not being able to phase into the Garrison, or become temporarily stuck while phasing in. This is a temporary effect and should resolve as these services return.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re continuing to look into other issues outside of this impact on Garrison access, including realm latency and its affect on gameplay and questing elements. We&apos;ve implemented dozens of hotfixes over the last few hours, and will be continuing to work toward resolution of any outstanding issues.<br>
<br>
It doesn&apos;t matter if the garrisons are working when we can&apos;t even quest do to the ridiculous lag.<br>
The majority of our fixes are aimed at issues that are resulting in latency. Latency itself is not a singular issue, but is the effect of many compound issues--a few of which are related to Garrisons.<br>

HandyNotes - Draenor<br>
The HandyNotes_DraenorTreasures (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/handynotes_draenortreasures) addon is especially useful while you are leveling, as there are lots of treasures and rare spawns that give experience, gold, items, and garrison resources. You need the base HandyNotes addon (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/handynotes) to run the Draenor module.<br>
