A couple of armor sets have been released over the past weeks and we had to go back at a couple of them to make more detailed previews. The new video previews should be fairly representative of the sets you will see in the final version of the game! <br>

Children&apos;s Week is Coming: April 29 - May 5<br>
Children&apos;s Week is coming! Taking place once a year in Orgrimmar, Stormwind, Dalaran, and Shattrath City, this week-long celebration is a time to give back to the innocents orphaned by war.<br>
<br>
This year, the holiday will begin on April 29 and will end on May 5. Take an orphan under your wing, perform the tasks you are presented with and you&#x2019;ll show one of Azeroth&#x2019;s children that you care (and be rewarded with a special in-game pet to boot).<br>
Many orphans wish they had someone special to show them the wonders of the world. Throughout the year, they often spend their time wandering around their home cities of Stormwind or Orgrimmar, dreaming of the day they&apos;ll be old enough (and big enough) to venture out into the world to see the sights their parents would have shown them.<br>
<br>
During Children&apos;s Week, brave heroes of the Horde and the Alliance can make these kids&apos; dreams come true! Visit your faction&#x2019;s local orphanage to take one of these children on a whirlwind adventure around the world.<br>
