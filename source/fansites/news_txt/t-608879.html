Stay tuned on MMO-Champion for the upcoming patch notes and changes. We&apos;re not sure about what&apos;s in this patch and it&apos;s still unsure if it will be a bug fix patch or if it will include more changes, this is probably the last patch before WotLK and Blizzard might have a few surprises in it. <br>
Yes the 2.4.3 PTR is coming soon. The forums were opened a little early and I would appreciate it if nobody spammed it before the realms are up.<br>
<br>
I would advise anyone who is going to particiapte in the 2.4.3 PTR to delete their old WOWtest folder now so that you have no problems with the new install.</div></div>
