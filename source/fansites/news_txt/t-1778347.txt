The Iron Horde Invades Hellfest 2015
Are you ready to see the Iron Horde go heavy metal? It all started last November, when Grommash’s celebration of the lineup announcement for Hellfest 2015 quickly ignited an epic conversation between Warcraft fans and metal fans.

With over 100.000 attendees, Hellfest https://www.facebook.com/hellfest is a massive metal music festival that no true orc would ever want to miss. Last year Grommash and his Iron Horde were too busy getting ready to invade Azeroth and didn’t have time for a detour to western France. This year, they are prepared…

So this summer, we’ll be there in person to take a closer look at what happens when these two worlds collide – and we’re looking forward to sharing the results with you.

We’ll have more information soon about what we’ll be doing there. Stay tuned because you won’t want to miss #WoWAtHellfest 2015!
