Patch 4.2 - Crafting Materials Base Price Changes
Patch 4.1 already nerfed the NPC sell price of cut uncommon gems http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2244-Patch-4.1-PTR-Notes-April-8th-Update-Patch-4.1-PTR-Build-13850 in Cataclysm but it seems that Blizzard is taking things one step further in 4.2. I'm pretty sure some of those changes will have repercussions on all the friendly Auction House farmers out there.
