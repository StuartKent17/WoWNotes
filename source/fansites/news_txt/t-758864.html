Patch 4.0.1 is now available on test realms (=not beta, the regular test realms). People who aren&apos;t in the Cataclysm beta yet can now test most of the Cataclysm features, aside from anything requiring leveling. <br>

This is basically the exact same build as Cataclysm Beta, just without all the Cataclysm-only stuff. <br>

<br>
General<br>
<br>
Copied Test Realm characters are not copied with their achievement history in order to better facilitate the character copy process.<br>
<br>
<br>
Classes: General<br>
<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Many class talents, spells, and abilities have been overhauled, added, or removed.<br>
&lt;li&gt;All spell and ability tooltips will now display damage averages rather than minimum and maximum damage potential. This feature is on by default but can be changed via the Display settings under User Interface options.<br>
&lt;li&gt;Ammo has been removed from the game.<br>
&lt;li&gt;The character levels at which classes gain new spells and abilities have changed.<br>
&lt;li&gt;Many item and class stats have been changed or removed.<br>
&lt;li&gt;Rage has been normalized.<br>
&lt;li&gt;Spells and abilities no longer have multiple ranks and now scale with character level.<br>
&lt;li&gt;Talent trees have been altered. All player talent specializations have been reset, allowing for free re-specialization.<br>
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each specialization has been reduced to a 31-point talent tree.<br>
&lt;li&gt;Players will now get a total of 41 talent points to spend.<br>
&lt;li&gt;Players will be asked to choose a specialization at level 10. Doing so will result in the unlocking of a spell or ability unique to that specialization, as well as one or more passive bonuses.<br>
&lt;li&gt;Once a talent specialization has been chosen, players may only place points in the primary tree until at least 31 points have been spent there.<br>
&lt;li&gt;The initial announcement regarding these talent tree changes can be found on our Cataclysm forum: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=25626290449&amp;sid=1<br>
