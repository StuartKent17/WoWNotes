Two updates about the Winter Veil.

Christmas Hat drops
Christmas came early this year and [item=21524] and [item=21525] are already dropping from bosses It wasn't supposed to happen until 25th december according to the official site. However, it won't be as easy as you think, level 60 bosses don't drop these hats for level 70 players, you will have to run regular outland instances to get them. 

Winter Veil bosses of Azeroth

New patterns
Good news ! You're supposed to get new patterns like [item=34261] directly in your mail from Great Father Winter himself. Bad news, nobody exactly knows how to get them. 
We're currently investigating this matter—quite avidly, to be brutally honest—and hope to reach a solid answer shortly; until then, we will be unable to directly assist any players who have not yet received Winter Veil patterns or recipes, as we must establish baseline requisites before providing such items to the public.

Once more, you have my most sincere apologies for leading you astray; nonetheless, our intent has not changed—we still wish to ensure that all those deserving of these patterns and recipes acquire them—though our method of "attack" has altered slightly for the time being. 
On a side note, it seems that both [item=34319] and [item=34261] are bugged and let you skill up your tailoring up to 375 even if they're gray, but i'm not the one who told you. I guess it's a nice christmas present for tailors, but I doubt it was intended

Update : Free skillup hotfixed.

Gas clouds hotfix
According to various mails and reports I got, it seems that Gas Cloud harvesting has been successfuly hotfixed and is now working again. You can now enjoy your easy primal farming again.

2.3.2 PTR - Account Status
Yesterday I posted "The PTR authentication servers were not updated between 2.3 and 2.3.2, meaning that if your password changed or if your account was otherwise invalid prior to October 8th you will not be eligible for the 2.3.2 PTR."

This was an horrible copy paste from the blue post that I didn't take the time to read carefully and it's actually very misleading. You can play on PTRs without problems if you changed your password after October 8th, you will just have to use your old password.
