Blue posters have been surprisingly calm yesterday, that&apos;s not the first time but it could mean great things for today. <br>
<br>
Notes about the class changes list<br>
A longer explanation might get the attention of most of the users. The list posted yesterday IS NOT from the patch notes, it&apos;s more than likely a leak from an internal mail/meeting discussing potential changes for classes. 90% of them probably won&apos;t be in the initial release of the 2.4 Patch on PTRs and even if they&apos;re added later, keep in mind that you&apos;ll be playing on a TEST server used to ... test changes and see how it works with enough people to gather an accurate feedback. <br>
<br>
<br>
Spell haste and Global Cooldown<br>
In 2.4, Spell haste will let you decrease your global cooldown, Nethaera explains how efficient it will be.<br>
With haste gear you can work toward lowering the GCD down to 1 second, but it will take more than just gear to max it. <br>
You can max it with the use of both haste on gear and abilities/talents.<br>
<br>
<br>
Raid UI changes in 2.4<br>
Another feature has been added to the raid UI in 2.4<br>
The Raid UI now can display the range of players relative to you. The option to enable this is in the Party &amp; Raid section of the UI Options.<br>
<br>
<br>
Blizzcast Episode 2<br>
The Episode 2 of the Blizzcast is currently in post-production and will probably be released in the the upcoming weeks. Bornakk reminds people that you won&apos;t necessarily see tons of new things here.<br>
<br>
If you missed the first Episode you can download it here (http://us.media.blizzard.com/blizzcast/blizzcast_episode1.mp3) or just check its page (http://us.blizzard.com/blizzcast/archive/episode1.xml) on the official site for a transcript/stream.<br>
And to build off what was said, the tag line at the top of the official BlizzCast page is &quot;Taking you deeper into the world of Blizzard.&quot; While new game/content information might be discussed from time to time, that isn&apos;t the primary goal. Instead we want to bring some unique perspectives to the variety of aspects involved in making games and our company in general.<br>
<br>
<br>
2.4 Potential class changes<br>
Read this first<br>
It&apos;s unconfirmed and potentially fake (50% chance I&apos;d say)<br>
Most of these changes won&apos;t be in the initial release of the 2.4 Patch on PTR, it&apos;s more a todo-list for classes changes than a full list of changes at the release.<br>
According to the source, they&apos;re a list of changes that Blizzard will like to experiment on the PTRs. You won&apos;t see them in patch notes until Blizzard decides or not to test them on a PTR build. That&apos;s why they&apos;re called TEST servers<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The &quot;Blue posters are always right&quot; minute<br>
What we&apos;ve posted on the forums is the extent of the notes we&apos;ve made public at this point in time. The complete official notes have not been posted yet. Please take anything posted outside the forums or website with a grain of salt.<br>
<br>
This could perfectly be a fake, seriously, if you didn&apos;t read this before going through the changes you&apos;ll probably make a hundred of puppies sad. <br>
