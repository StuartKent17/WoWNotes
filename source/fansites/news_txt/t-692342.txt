MMO-Champion Forums Changes
If you check the forums  regualrly you probably noticed a bunch of changes during the past few days. If you're not a member yet it's probably a very good time to register 

Forums reorganization
I moved a couple of "useless" forums and merged them with others. We no longer have duplicate Raids & Dungeons or General Discussions forums, the PvP forums have been merged, and a few inactive forums have been deleted. Guides and News Submissions because the interesting stuff is usually on the "real" forums

Moderators!
28 moderators have been added to the team! I do realize that it might look like they are trying to ban everything out there but the objective is to clean-up the forums and make them a happier place. The goal isn't to ban every non-constructive posts out there but we had to put a stop to a few bad habits.

So far it looks like the effect on most forums has been very positive and the quality of the discussion here went all the way up it doesn't mean that I'm happy with everything, send me a private message or a mail if you feel like something is wrong. I'm still looking for moderators for a few boards but keep in mind that 10% of the people who applied were recruited, you really need a fairly serious post history to join the moderators team. 

New forums
Now that the forums are a little more under control, I can finally add new forums! A new off-topic category has been added. 


<table border="0" width="75%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5" style="border: 1px solid #000; margin: auto"> <tr> <td colspan="2" class="catbg" height="18"> Off-Topic Forums ;sa=collapse#12 </td> </tr> <tr class="windowbg2"> <td class="windowbg" width="6%" align="center" valign="top"> </td> <td> Computer 
Anything related to hardware and software here, if you're wondering why your computer turned into a giant fireball this is the place. </td> </tr> <tr class="windowbg2"> <td class="windowbg" width="6%" align="center" valign="top"> </td> <td> Video Games 
Computer and Console Games </td> </tr> <tr class="windowbg2"> <td class="windowbg" width="6%" align="center" valign="top"> </td> <td> Music 
Discuss anything related to music here! </td> </tr> <tr class="windowbg2"> <td class="windowbg" width="6%" align="center" valign="top"> </td> <td> Cinema and TV Shows 
Discuss movies and TV Shows here! </td> </tr> </table>

The goal with these new forums is to let you posts about non-related WoW subjects without spamming the current ones. Depending on the success of the new boards I might add a few more of them in the future.

I would also like to point out that the moderation will be very strict on the new forums until we get things started, if you plan to post here I STRONGLY suggest that you read the rules :
