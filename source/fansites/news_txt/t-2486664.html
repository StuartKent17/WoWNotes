In Patch 8.2, players will be able to complete a quest chain to obtain Gnome Heritage Armor (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8473-Patch-8-2-PTR-Gnome-Heritage-Armor-Quest-Chain) and Tauren Heritage Armor (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8496-Patch-8-2-PTR-Tauren-Heritage-Armor-Quest-Chain-Ask-Mr-Robot-Class-Guides).<br>
Rise up and stand tall with two new Heritage Armor sets&#x2014;one for gnomes and one for tauren&#x2014;coming in the Rise of Azshara content update.<br>
<br>
Players with maximum-level (120) gnomes or tauren* who are Exalted with their faction (Gnomeregan or Thunder Bluff respectively) will be able to embark on a new quest line for each race to learn more about their history. Once you complete your quest, you&#x2019;ll gain a new Heritage Armor transmogrification set unique to your race and be able to show off your pride.<br>
<br>
*Tauren will also first need to complete the War Campaign quest Stay of Execution, which will be available shortly after the launch of Rise of Azshara.<br>
