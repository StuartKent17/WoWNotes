Boats and Portals on Map - Patch 8.0.1<br>
With the pre-expansion patch, hub maps now display a circular icon at locations for boats and portals. When you hover your cursor over these icons it will tell you the name of the location that the boat or portal leads to and the continent.<br>

Addon Spotlight - Personal Loot Helper BfA Changes<br>
Personal Loot Helper creator CardinalM1 (https://www.reddit.com/user/CardinalM1) recently shared a Reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/8z6qwm/personal_loot_helper_major_changes_for_bfa/) detailing all the changes that were made to the addon with the prepatch and beyond. For those who do not know, this addon has been used by many people to share personal loot that is upgrades to others and not to the one who receives the item initially. You can download the addon from the Twitch client or here (https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/personal-loot-helper). Here is a breakdown of what has changed!<br>
<br>
<br>
Updated UI<br>
Reduced sSocial pressure to trade away your personal loot<br>
The addon will no longer notify via chat that an item is an upgrade. <br>
The addon will not automatically whisper anyone.<br>
Coordinate Rolls mode has been removed.<br>
The option to display loot in raid frames has been removed.<br>
When you loot an item you will now have the option to &quot;keep&quot; or &quot;offer to group.&quot;<br>
If the user selects &quot;keep&quot; then the addon will not make any alerts.<br>
If the user selects &quot;offer to group&quot; then the addon will notify anyone using the addon that can use the item that it is available.<br>
Notified players can either pass or request the item for main spec, off spec or transmog.<br>
The addon does an internal /roll for each requestor and shows the looter each requestors&#x2019; reason for rolling, ilvl difference, and roll. The looter can then choose to keep the item for themselves after all or trade it to one of the requestors.<br>
Ultimately the decision is still up to the looter as the trade still has to happen manually.<br>
If a winner is made, the addon will alert the person to open a trade.<br>
The entire group does not see this going on, so social pressure is alleviated.<br>
