In our continuing effort to improve the gameplay experience for our players, we&#x2019;ve recently made optimizations, specifically to Naxxramas performance, based on feedback from players. With these changes, we are carefully monitoring server performance to gauge the change&#x2019;s success. In addition to that, we would very much like to hear our players&apos; personal experience in Naxxramas this week. We are asking players to post your feedback in terms of what if any changes in performance you&#x2019;ve noticed in Naxxramas. Please make sure to include the realm you play on and the time frame you were participating in Naxxramas. <br>

Raid Bug - Circle of Healing / Wild Growth prevented by Vortex<br>
We identified a bug preventing Circle of Healing and Wild Growth from being able to find targets in Vortex. It was not our intent that these heals be prevented during Vortex (beyond the nerf we already made to prevent them from being spammed).<br>
<br>
We should be able to fix this in the next couple of days. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14697634915-vortex-damage.html))<br>

Raid and UI Design - Disappearance of groups in raids<br>
Our long-term goal is to get rid of the notion of groups within a raid. We want players to be able to organize their UI however they want -- by class, by role, alphabetically or whatever. With the overhaul to the buff / debuff system we made a lot of progress towards this goal, but that left us with a few awkward reasons to still put certain players together.<br>
<br>
From a high-level, the design is to be in a group. That group can have 5, 10 or 25 max players depending on the content. There shouldn&apos;t be a (weird) notion of being in both a 5 player and 25 player group at the same time. Imagine for a 25-player raid that the UI just shows 25 players.

Bigger isn&apos;t always better!<br>
Sure. My point was that the dude who takes the most damage is not the best tank. The best tank is the person who takes the least damage while still locking the mobs onto them quickly and thoroughly. Standing in the fire is not the sign of a good tank. Ignoring your Shield Block or Barkskin is not the sign of a good tank.<br>
<br>
A healer who heals mostly themselves, overheals a lot, runs out of mana, needs to borrow candles, forgets to cleanse and lets the tank die is not a good healer, even if they have the highest number.<br>
<br>
The damage-dealer who tops the chart, but pulls aggro, stands in the fire, breaks CC (lolwut?), and argues with all of your strategies is probably not the guy you want in your raid.<br>
<br>
But all other things being equal, higher numbers in damage and healing are still better and do have a strong correlation to player gear and skill. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14697301234-sorry-blizz-doesnt-balance-based-on-qq.html))<br>

Mana Pool<br>
The problem is that there should not be infinite mana classes currently in the game. You should not run OOM every single fight (if you play well). But you should not be able to ignore it either.<br>
<br>
For what it&apos;s worth, Resto shamans are often listed as the healer that can run out of mana. Paladins, priests and druids should ideally play a lot more like that. They do seem to run OOM in PvP, but not really in PvE. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14697625720-design-philosophy-question.html))<br>

Starfall purpose<br>
The purpose of Starfall is to do extra damage. What I mean by that is that the spell is not channeled so you can use it along with a Hurricane or whatever other spell you want to cast. It was never intended to be a de-stealther and we&apos;ve become unenamored with random stun chances added to other spells.<br>
<br>
One criticism which we think is totally valid is the paltry coefficient on Starfall. We will be hotfixing in a more reasonable number soon (tm). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14697635409-starfall-discussion.html))<br>

Talent Trees and playstyle<br>
The key is playstyle. It is easiest to explain with the death knight. The blood tree emphasizes melee combat and healing. The frost tree emphasizes frost damage and control. The unholy tree emphasizes diseases and minions.<br>
<br>
To do the same thing with hunters, you&apos;d say that BM emphasizes the pet, MM emphasizes the shots, and SV emphasizes the traps. That&apos;s a gross generalization, but you get the idea. If you like to manage your pet, you might like BM. If you want to spend less effort running the pet in and out of combat and want traps to be a smaller part of your game, then you might look at MM, understanding that it probably means more emphasis on your ranged attacks.<br>
<br>
But you could PvP (or in the case of the death knight, tank) with any tree as long as you maximized your focus on that role with the specific talents you chose. The trees themselves become more like flavor: do you like Frost, Fire or Arcane spells?<br>
<br>
Again, this all assumes that the relative dps, pvp utility, tanking or healing are all equitable, which is something we are trying to improve. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14697605725-hunter-talent-direction.html))<br>

Warlock survavibility in PvP against paladins<br>
We are okay (for now) with exposing yourself to CC if you use certain abilities. However, the glyph of Turn Evil turning that spell into an instant cast is probably a problem and something we are likely to fix.

We have some PvP-oriented changes in mind for Shadow. We hope to be able to announce them soon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14133413577--shadow-priests-pvp-improvment-suggestions.html))<br>

Guardian Spirit not procing properly the 50% heal<br>
Update: the problem does seem to be related to a second hit killing the target before the GS heal can actually kick in. We should be hotfixing in a solution soon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14697593701-so-hotfix-for-gs.html))<br>

Bug - Spirit/Spellpower portion of Fel Armor not working properly with Demonic Pact<br>
It is a bug. The intent is that the Spirit benefit is similar to the other buffs mentioned (and that none of them stack). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14697621436-demo-warlock--fel-armor-bug.html))<br>
