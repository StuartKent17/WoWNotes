WoW Token &#x2013; Additional Details<br>
As many players are aware, there are certain limits in place regarding how many WoW Tokens can be purchased per Battle.net account, both from the in-game Shop and through the Auction House. Today, we&#x2019;d like to provide a quick update on the current limits to help you better plan your Token purchases. <br>
<br>
<br>
A maximum of 10 Tokens per week may be purchased for real money from the in-game Shop, to be sold on the Auction House for gold.<br>
A maximum of 36 Tokens every 24 months may be purchased for gold via the Auction House, to be used for game time.<br>
Players may only have one type of Token in their inventory at one time. If any character on a Battle.net account is currently holding a Token purchased from the in-game Shop, that player will not be able to purchase a Token from the Auction House. Likewise, if any character is holding a Token purchased from the Auction House, that player will not be able to purchase a Token from the in-game Shop.<br>
Players may hold a maximum of 10 Tokens in their inventory at one time. This limit is shared across all characters on the Battle.net account.<br>

Warlock Instant CS Macro<br>
Thanks for the report. We&apos;re looking into this and hope to have a fix soon.<br>
<br>
I&apos;ve gone ahead and deleted the exploit from the earlier posts in this thread. For future reference, we have the ability to look at previous versions of posts, so if you do need to share information on how an exploit works, you can edit that information out once your post is made and we&apos;ll still be able to see it.

Hey can you fix the Noble&apos;s Fancy Boots from darkmoon faire vendor to be cosmetic? It&apos;s still labelled cloth for some reason.<br>
We hope to have this addressed in an upcoming patch. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/622159647772815360))<br>

I&apos;m really not supposed to reply on my personal account. Sometimes my enthusiasm gets the best of me and I do. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621915428214829057))<br>
<br>
Will this new feature allow for crossfaction arenas? Hate being tied to one faction because everyone else is<br>
No, the intent of this feature is to reduce queue times for battlegrounds and Ashran. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/621892201073618944))<br>
<br>
.Will certain class/race combos always trigger other races in Merc Mode? ex Troll/Shaman always Dwarf, or will it be random?<br>
You will be changed to a different race based on your class. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/621892389985103872))<br>
<br>
considering mercenary mode for rated content? Alot of comic books have horde and alliance fighting on the same side in arenas.<br>
No we are not. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/622041090309275648))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
Failed the naval mission for the Black Market AH item. I thought failed missions could be retried? It&apos;s not available anymore<br>
It will come back, but you may have to wait a while. Not all missions reappear immediately if failed. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/621891954763141121))<br>
<br>
is there an ETA on fixing the Spirit Lodge/Mage Tower constructs? They haven&apos;t worked since 6.2.<br>
This is slated to be addressed in an upcoming patch. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/622159391060463617))<br>
