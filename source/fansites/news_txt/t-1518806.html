Patch 5.4.8 - Valor Changes<br>
There have been a few changes to Valor in Patch 5.4.8: <br>
<br>
<br>
Deeds of Valor (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/112353-deeds-of-valor) is now sold by Mistweaver Ai (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/73305-mistweaver-ai) for 3000 Timeless Coin (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/777-timeless-coin).<br>
Heart of the Valorous (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/161795-heart-of-the-valorous) was initially active for all characters when the PTR came up, but this no longer appears to be the case.<br>
Legendary Cloaks (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-reqlvl-min=90&amp;filter-quality=32) and Siege of Orgrimmar raid loot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=17056&amp;filter-found-in-raid-1=6738&amp;filter-found-in-raid-2=-1&amp;filter-reqlvl-min=90&amp;filter-quality=16) are now upgradeable four times, up from two. Garrosh Heirloom weapons (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=17056&amp;filter-reqlvl-min=90&amp;filter-quality=128) have had their item level increased by 8.<br>

All upgradable epic quality items introduced in Patch 5.4 (items found in Siege of Orgrimmar and on the Timeless Isles) will now be eligible to be upgraded an additional 2 times for a total increase of 16 item levels. Please note, this change does not apply to PvP gear.<br>
Heirloom weapons (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/weapons?filter-reqlvl-min=90&amp;filter-quality=128) awarded by Garrosh Hellscream have been increased by 8 item levels to keep them on parity with the additional 2 upgrade levels given to other items.<br>
Mistweaver Ai (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/73305-mistweaver-ai) on the Timeless Isle next to the Celestial Court now sells a token called Deeds of Valor (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/112353-deeds-of-valor) for 3000 Timeless Coin (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/777-timeless-coin).

Item Squish and Old Raids<br>
Let me see if I got the question right, you want to know if a Level 90 soloing older Raid tiers will have as difficult a time post stat squish? <br>
<br>
There will be special handling in place for players to retain the ability to solo older raid content. Players will deal bonus damage against and take reduced damage from lower-level creatures from past expansions.<br>
<br>
I thought the question was about raiding old content at the level they were intended for? (BC at 70, WotLK at 80, etc.) This is something I&apos;d like to know too, as my guild does this.<br>
<br>
Will the squish have an affect on that? From what I understand, gear increases within old expansions will be taken out, which kind of removes all progression. But I understand why you&apos;re doing it. Will this buff only appear at max level or will all players get it whenever they enter the raid? I&apos;d like to know just so I can help plan how my guild&apos;s progression will pan out as WoD gets closer to release. <br>
<br>
I&apos;d hate to have raiding old stuff at lower levels become impossible due to the item changes.<br>
It&apos;s not a buff, more of a behind-the-scenes calculations type change. And running older raids with characters that are at the intended level ranges should still be possible post-squish.<br>
<br>
it&apos;s rather disappointing that this is the only way of handling it. How do you reckon this will affect players who choose to twink at say level 60 or 70 or 80? If I at level 90 need a behind-the-scenes buff to be able to solo older content, how do you propose players will get achievements like Herald of the Titans?<br>
Older raid content isn&apos;t intended to be soloable by characters at the appropriate level ranges. A level 70 character will not be able to solo Black Temple. But a level 90 character can do that currently, and will continue to be able to do so post stat squish.

Blizzard is going to replace the Reforge Vendor on that thing with a different Vendor. Which Vendor, exactly, is unknown currently.<br>

Why is GCD capping a bad thing? I love playing WW monk exactly because it feels so button mashy. Fighting game-esque.<br>
That&apos;s not necessarily tied to being GCD capped. GCD capping is bad because it makes energy not your primary resource. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464118948170956801))<br>
Thx! I like the chi/energy dance. Never have to stop mashing as long as I switch between those correctly. Will be preserved?<br>
You can choose to play that way with strongly favoring haste and energy regen. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464129606530772993))<br>

I&apos;m confused on movement speed debuffs, are they also additive? 50% debuff + 70% increase in speed = 120% speed or 85% speed?<br>

Blood Death knight&apos;s need empty GCD&apos;s to better react to gameplay? Why reduce player activity instead of allowing a skill gap?<br>
Are those different things? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464228134317850624))<br>
Experienced Blood players understand incoming damage patterns, they should not need forced empty GCD&apos;s to save runes for burst.<br>
But is the gameplay not better and more skillful if they have space to react? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464229028321189889))<br>
(ct) simply having nothing to do? Gameplay depth is not the issue, lack of activity is, players enjoy doing things!<br>
Having a few small gaps here and there is not a &quot;lack of activity&quot;. It&apos;s possible that you&apos;re imagining much more. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464230266782089216))<br>

Will multistrike have added value for feral? Currently it looks like crit that does less damage and won&apos;t trigger primal fury<br>
It does the same damage per rating. We may add an additional hook for it, if necessary. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463980472104525824))<br>

its a legit question. if u put things like &quot;lone wolf&quot; into talent trees the question follows logically, how far do u take that?<br>
Similar to Grimoire of Sacrifice, we&apos;ll examine abilities that seem to require a pet and adjust accordingly. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463824865485541377))<br>
Given its a cooldown and not rotational, some of the clunk is gone,. But still awkward to use on some bosses (Magmaw)<br>
Traps and how they trigger are done with newer technology now; works *much* more consistently. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463940223185866752))<br>
Won&apos;t Bear Trap force SV hunters to stand in melee. Dropping a trap is faster than launching -&gt; dps increase<br>

Yours thoughts on Fire mage &quot;rotation&quot;, being fairly bland and devoid of real decision making like Frost/Arcane has? Pre talents<br>
A) We disagree. B) Post-talents is what matters, not pre-talents. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464218956232790016))<br>
<br>
I specifically mean blizzard, arcane explosion, and flamestrike<br>
All should have useful, decent AoE. Having somewhat different/situational AoE strength is one part of spec differentiation. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464221686313656322))<br>
is it going to be harder than currently to switch spec for mages? from fire to arcane/frost the secondaries differ a lot<br>
That&apos;s very intentional. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464222508590186496))<br>
but say, rogues/warlocks, secondaries are generally close enough that you can switch spec without nearly as much penalty<br>
We want them to be closer, yes. But not exactly equal. And different specs favoring different stats is a good thing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464222941031317504))<br>

Still worried about Rune of Power. Feel like we&apos;re not getting enough detail on it. Mage will still be more fun at 89 than 90+<br>

Why would anybody take RoP if it&apos;s not the best dps option? Why would anybody take the others if RoP is the best option?...<br>

Is anything changing with Elemental Blast? If not could you atleast change the buff to work with weak auras.<br>
Maybe, but why? What benefit would you get? In a way, it&apos;s saving you from yourself by not having separate auras. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463940777932910592))<br>

<br>
..glad is easier to gear than arms/fury, due to access to armor gear, +relative low competition for shields?<br>

Check out our patch notes; we&apos;ve made changes specifically for this. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464215714497191936))<br>
THats not really true, Fury was palyed compettively in 496 gear in Tier 14.<br>
Indeed; it&apos;s more a &apos;feel&apos; thing than actual performance, but both are somewhat valid. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464217858021412864))<br>
<br>
Art<br>
Beautiful! Do some of your team specialize in plants? They always feel like they were created by someone who loves them<br>
We love every piece of art that goes into the game. Plants are no different but we do tend to look at them as characters. (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/464216670559809536))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
Do you guys ever plan to fix the Haunted Memento bug that cancels eating to get your food buff? Been there way too long.<br>
Yep, I believe I fixed that for 6.0. It was bugging the shit out of me, too. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464295767516008448))<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br>
when the 6.0 patch hits, how does it affect gear for the current spirit=hit classes? Should we scramble for non spirit gear?<br>
You&apos;ll want to find non-spirit rings/necklace/cloak/trinkets. The rest will automatically become something useful to you. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464093661861396480))<br>
<br>
Strength, Agility and Intellect are virtually identical now and no one uses more than one, so why keep the distinction?<br>
A worthy question to ask. It comes down to understandability, and fantasy. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464217728014774272))<br>
<br>
Proving Grounds<br>
Are the current Proving grounds achieves/titles being removed in WoD for new ones.<br>
Most likely they&apos;re going to turn into feats of strength, though we haven&apos;t decided yet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463947133226188800))<br>
Thx hopefully you keep us up on it to let us know in advance.<br>
Of course. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464130193787871232))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
What happens if we have someone die before the 4.5 min charge time on the battle res? What about two people?<br>
Everyone starts with one charge, so you can res immediately if needed. If two die on the pull, you&apos;d need to wait for the second. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/464212842564960257))<br>
<br>
In-combat resurrection spells still have cooldowns, right? Or you were just talking theoretically?<br>
In raid encounters, the only cooldown is the raidwide charge system. Unchanged outside of boss encounters. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/464540620493975553))<br>
<br>
&quot;The Immortal achievement only worked because Naxx was relatively easy.&quot; It didn&apos;t work. Other people screwed up my achievement.<br>
Most raid achievements involve a group effort, not a personal one. Immortal was different because you had to wait a week to try again (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/464427513536872449))<br>
<br>
Just remembered the old sha of fear Lei&apos;s Hope mechanic, any plans to reuse that mechanic for current or future tiers? Garrosh?<br>
It was useful for that particular context, but for now, we&apos;ll try to focus on not making 20-minute-long encounters. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/464427910808735744))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
So PVE gear would be optimal for Gladiator warriors in PVP<br>
We&apos;re still deciding the role of tanks in PvP. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464093975054266368))<br>
<br>
What protections would be necessary to keep 2-3 people from camping 2-3 people who rez at staggered times?<br>
If people are getting graveyard camped in a Rated BG, they&apos;ve just been outclassed. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463829110620299264))<br>
Definitely something to avoid in Normal BGs though. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463829185404760064))<br>
<br>
Do people routinely get graveyard camped in RATED battlegrounds? I have never witnessed this personally. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463829468029530112))<br>
No. Because they get rezzed in waves. Now lets have a look at the new picture and try to figure out what&apos;s different <br>
Or the fact that teams are far more coordinated in Rated. I rarely see a fight approach a graveyard unless one team is overmatched. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463831993394819072))<br>
<br>
Strongly considering a fixed resurrection time for Rated Battlegrounds in Warlords (i.e. always 25 seconds) instead of wave spawning. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463826196992499712))<br>
It&apos;s in place to prevent spawn camping for uncoordinated groups in normal battlegrounds. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463847775470247936))<br>
In rated battlegrounds, it often means winning a team fight doesn&apos;t matter due to a short res timer. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463848039354871809))<br>
Dislike. If there&apos;s graveyard camping in RBGs: it&apos;s the MMR system, not the res timer system.<br>
this isn&apos;t to fix graveyard camping (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/464060385264300032))<br>
Won&#x2019;t that make graveyard camping easier? One popping up at a time instead of an entire group? Turns it into wack a mole no?<br>
Usually people die but the team fight goes on. People are much less spread out in Rated BGs. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463829740327927808))<br>
.it almost guarantees when one or two people die from your team that it&apos;s a for sure wipe. Having people on the same Rez is good<br>
Counterpoint is that if a team wins a team fight, they actually win versus sometimes the 4 people they killed instantly return (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463852204189679616))<br>
<br>
Spawning in waves would remain in Normal Battlegrounds. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463828216507928577))<br>
That&apos;s cool, could the UI Map get a Timer on the gy rez? I&apos;ve yet to find an addon that can track it. Maybe I need to look around.<br>
It is intentionally not available to addons. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/464218343482724352))<br>
<br>
why would normal bgs still happen in waves?<br>
In normal bgs, where things are very uncoordinated, it helps to resurrect alongside teammates. In RBGs, that isn&apos;t necessary. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/464094928511827968))<br>
<br>
I miss arena team names and arena team banners. Any plans to bring them back, maybe as a reward?<br>
No plans but see the value (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463920038160781312))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
Will there be a specific NPC that is the best blacksmith? Or will there be multiple blacksmiths that are all good?<br>
Current plan is that follower level and quality will modify how much that blacksmith follower helps you out.<br>
Some rare followers might have the coveted Level 2 mining trait, but they&apos;ll be difficult to find. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/463837273146916865))<br>
what is the difference between lvl 1 and 2 miners<br>
More stuff generated per time (note that this is all still in flux and will likely be simplified before ship) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/463874017149976578))<br>
