Vanilla WoW Developer Interview - John Staats
We recently had the opportunity to talk to John Staats https://whenitsready.com/ about his ongoing Kickstarter https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/whenitsready/the-world-of-warcraft-diary-0 for a book about Vanilla WoW development that ends tomorrow!

The book is now the most funded non fiction book in Kickstarter history. If you are interested in how it was created, there is an article about the book's creation and approval https://whenitsready.com/four-developers-how-the-wow-diary-happened/.

WoW Token and The Dreadwake Mount
You won't get The Dreadwake mount https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8003-Pirate-s-Day-Live-The-Dreadwake-Shop-Mount-Cap-n-Crackers-Shop-Pet if you convert Tokens into game time.
Hey guys,

I just wanted to confirm that you would NOT get the Dreadwake mount if you convert your WoW Tokens into game time directly.

In this case you would need to claim the tokens for balance first and then buy the correct bundle from our shop, here:
https://eu.shop.battle.net/en-gb/product/world-of-warcraft-mount-dreadwake-gametime-bundle

Hope this helps!
