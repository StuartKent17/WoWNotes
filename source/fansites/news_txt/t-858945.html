I missed a couple of blue posts because of the PTR, let&apos;s not waste precious class information! <br>
Patch 4.1 and beyond<br>
We have more in store even past patch 4.1 and we&apos;ll be sharing more details about them before much longer. We&apos;ll also be sharing a more complete look at Zul&apos;Gurub and Zul&apos;Aman (including the updated mounts.) Though, testing on the PTR will get you a look at it more up front and personal.<br>
<br>
We are not near the &quot;end&quot; of things in World of Warcraft nor at the &quot;end&quot; of our ideas. Development takes time though and we plan to make sure that experiences in game continue to be epic. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/160462/who-was-hoping-for-more))<br>

Low Level Tanking<br>
We do think this is a legitimate concern. While we spend most of our fine-tuning at max level, we also want things to feel good at lower levels as well.The new bear AE rotation was based around Thrash, which is a high level spell. It works at high level, but without Thrash there is a lot of down time and it can be hard to AE tank. Since lower level dungeons don&#x2019;t tend to be balanced on a razor&#x2019;s edge, AE&#x2019;ing is the norm, which can feel bad for lower level druids. We do think this is a problem and we&#x2019;d like to address it at some point in time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/160276/why-druids-are-frustrated))<br>
<br>
Feral PvP<br>
We&#x2019;ve been over this issue quite a bit, but the core issue is that Ferals used to not have a lot of utility in PvP, but were also really hard to control. We watched as players told us over the years that they wanted more utility so that they could actually be a valuable member of their team, so we gave Ferals a lot of utility they didn&#x2019;t have before, but in turn we thought it was fair to make them slightly easier to control. We realize there are a few different ways we could have gone on this and that some players would no doubt have preferred to keep the iconic ability to not be crowd controlled instead of gaining things like an interrupt and better crowd control of their own.

<br>
Bear threat<br>
We just don&#x2019;t see this issue at level 85. All four of the tank classes seem to be performing well in both 5-player dungeons and in raids. We see all four tanks being used at a variety of levels. We just disagree that the difference is that obvious. Savage Defense might make bears take more damage on AE pulls in 5-player dungeons than other tanks, but we don&#x2019;t think AE threat generation is a problem (again when in reference to max level). Bears don&#x2019;t have an ability that mimics Shield Slam as a very hard-hitting ability that can help establish initial threat, but that is more of a raiding problem in encounters with frequent spawning adds and not really an issue with Swipe or Thrash.

Aspect Swapping<br>
Aspect swapping has come up quite a bit. In this thread, more than one of you expressed some annoyance with &#x2018;sound spam&#x2019; generated by Aspect swapping. We&apos;re interested in addressing the concerns about sound spam, and as a matter of fact, we&apos;ve been thinking about sound design quite a bit lately, and we&#x2019;d like to emphasize sound design more in the future. For example, we&apos;d like sound to serve more consistently as a gameplay cue. That strays away from the point, though, which is that we want there to be a trade off for hunters between standing still and doing more damage versus moving and doing less damage but getting mobility and potentially other benefits. For now, the best way to achieve that is via Aspects. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/160040/feb-18th-hunter-hotfixes))<br>
<br>
Freezing Trap<br>
Freezing Trap also came up quite a bit, in reference to multi-trapping. This ability was changed because we wanted hunters to be somewhat more consistent with the crowd control potential of other classes, and we didn&apos;t want any one class standing out as the absolute best at crowd control. We realize that it rewarded skill, and we like mechanics that do that. This wasn&#x2019;t the right place for it though, and we think that hunters can be rewarding to skilled players in other ways.
