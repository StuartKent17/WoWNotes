They also released a full video of the encounter, the encounter definitely looks much harder in Heroic Mode. The 1st part of the video will be available a bit later. <br>

AE Tanking<br>
Here are ways we could make AE tanking trivial. None of these are things we would actually do, though players have suggested some things dangerously close to them.<br>
<br>
-- Challenging Shout has no cooldown. Everything is pretty much taunted to you the whole time.<br>
-- You can tank everything by spamming Commanding Shout. (Back when say warriors tanked the pre-Nef adds, they could do it by spamming Battle or Demo Shout, which generated terrible threat but just enough to actually work on that encounter. Now it really won&apos;t work... but it could with the right numbers.)<br>
-- Thunder Clap hits so freaking hard that you hit it once and never really have to again.<br>
-- Thunder Clap puts a dot on everything (stronger than Deep Wounds) so that you hit it once and never really have to again.<br>
-- Defensive Stance has an 8000% threat modifier.<br>
<br>
Those ideas would all work if we wanted you to never lose threat. That&apos;s not the goal. On the other hand, the goal also is NOT:<br>
<br>
-- Some tank classes just generate a lot more AE threat than others.<br>
-- Some tank classes just AE tank a lot easier than others.<br>
-- AE tanking gets harder and harder over time as dps specs gear up.<br>
-- AE tanking is really, really challenging and you&apos;re at the constant risk of losing aggro.<br>
-- Just for completeness, I&apos;ll add the original one above, which is that you never, ever lose threat no matter what.<br>
<br>
What we like about the warrior AE tanking model that is worth extending to other classes without just duplicating the warrior abilities:<br>
<br>
-- You hit more than one button.<br>
-- You hit different buttons than you do when handling single targets.<br>
-- You have to pay attention to crowd controlled targets.<br>
-- You don&apos;t totally ignore your single-target abilities.<br>
-- You might switch targets on some pulls. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23767608815-please-do-away-with-faceroll-aoe-tanking.html))<br>

Beast Mastery<br>
If you&apos;re talking best possible gear, we think BM is pretty close to Survival in 3.3.3. Marks is ahead, and that&apos;s largely a function of armor pen, but again you are talking about absolute best gear. If you aren&apos;t in Icecrown 25 hard modes, then gear is likely to have just as much effect on your damage as spec. Ideally, things are balanced at all levels between level 1 and 80 with BiS gear, but there are going to be a lot of points along the way where that&apos;s probably not true. We see Survival hunters beat Marks hunters all the time in what I would categorize as average (meaning not server first guilds but capable of progressing) raids. Hopefully we&apos;ll see some BM guys up there too, but it may take higher gear levels. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23767539635-bm-hunters-still-need-help.html))<br>
<br>
I would be pretty surprised if guilds doing hard modes w/ access to lvl 80 BiS gear have hunters raiding as BM, or would be happy with a hunter choosing a spec that isn&apos;t min/max&apos;d.<br>
My suspicion is that the hunters with the gear you are describing will have a propensity to go Marks, because that currently yields the highest damage and raiders tend to play whatever does the highest damage. In a world without armor pen, that might not be the case (though I haven&apos;t done the math lately).<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, it is also true today that Marks can beat Survival, and yet there are a lot of Survival hunters raiding. Our hope is that in 3.3.3 that there will be as many BM hunters as Survival raiding, which would be a really nice bump for BM. Maybe the estimates (ours and those I&apos;ve read) about the boost BM is getting are overly optimistic. We&apos;ll see.<br>
<br>
It&apos;s possible the Survival hunters are only going Survival for Replenishment, though all 3 hunters bring some pretty solid raid benefits these days. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23767539635-bm-hunters-still-need-help.html))<br>

Shield Block<br>
If you don&apos;t think Shield Block is interesting enough today, that&apos;s a fine discussion to have. I&apos;m a little surprised to see any nostalgia for the old model though. Hitting a relatively common dps button that plays into other talents and abilities is one thing. Having to constantly mash &quot;make me slightly more survivable&quot; is another. I&apos;ll grant you that it was fun on Illidan, but it took that mechanic specifically to make it fun.<br>
<br>
Imagine how you&apos;d react to this scenario:<br>
<br>
GC: Good news, everyone! We lowered the cooldown of Shield Wall to 5 sec and balanced assuming you hit it every 5 sec.<br>
<br>
Tanks: Um.... Thanks? Could you maybe just make it a passive at that point?<br>
<br>
GC: But hitting buttons is fun! (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23767557794-just-get-rid-of-dodge-and-parry-altogether.html))</div></div>
