I finally have enough data from the beta to post a decent preview of companion pets introduced in the expansion! This might not be the final list but it&apos;s much more impressive than the first one I posted a few weeks ago, I think we had 3 pets back then. And well, you could always visit Warcraftpets (http://www.warcraftpets.com/news/), Breanni is nice. <br>

Tanking<br>
Swipe Nerf / Thunderclap and Tank Threat boost<br>
We had already nerfed Swipe before I saw this conversation, because it was pretty far out in front of other tank AE dps. Thunder Clap&apos;s coefficient is something like 0.10 and that could probably be 0.20, which would bring it more in line.<br>
<br>
We are also talking a lot about just buffing tank threat across the board, because we&apos;ve heard a lot recently that it&apos;s still too twitchy. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026377623/thunderclap-is-too-weak/))<br>
<br>
Tanking classes cannot AE Tank anymore<br>
That actually isn&apos;t an intended change. We don&apos;t want AE healing to be trivial. I&apos;ll use some examples:<br>
<br>
A) Pile of 20 whelps. Go ahead and AE tank this and ask your dps to AE too. You probably don&apos;t even need Shield Slam.<br>
<br>
B) One giant. I wouldn&apos;t use Thunder Clap at all on this, except as needed to keep the debuff up. We want Thunder Clap to be terrible for holding single targets. (I don&apos;t think many tanks would argue this point.)<br>
<br>
C) A pack of 4 targets that you plan to burn down one at a time. Here is the biggest point of contention. Thunder Clap should be fine for establishing initial aggro (though Shockwave will be better), and it should be fine for keeping add #3 off of the healer. But you should feel like you have to go to town with single target abilities on add #1 that the dps are all focused on. Then you should switch attention to add #2. In Lich King, it was too easy to just hold this whole group with Thunder Clap spam, and to be fair, the dps would just AE as well.<br>
<br>
D) The same pack as in C, but this time you decide to CC add #3 and #4. In this case, you should be able to live fine without Thunder Clap at all (unless you really need the debuff). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026377623/thunderclap-is-too-weak/))<br>
<br>
[...] Right. If you are trying to AE tank and a bad dps is attacking the wrong target and dies, we call that justice. If you are trying to AE tank and a healer pulls aggo, then threat generation is just too low and we need to buff it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026377623/thunderclap-is-too-weak/))<br>

Cannot macro Lifebloom while in Tree of Life on Beta<br>
This is a (dumb) limitation of our macro system, where it gets confused if you have two spells with the same name. In this case, the Tree of Life Lifebloom is actually a different spell than normal Lifebloom. The macro tries to cast (normal) Lifebloom, sees that you can&apos;t because it isn&apos;t allowed in Tree of Life, and just bails. Lifebloom is not the only spell in this category.<br>
<br>
We understand why this is bad and are working on a fix. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026396849/druids-heals-need-help/))<br>
