Update (10:00 CET) - Added something about season 1 gear to the season 3 post, EU Migrations, new fan arts, and a little something about Kil&apos;jaeden. <br>
<br>
Season 3 Gear rating requirement in Season 4<br>
Shoulders requirement will be lowered to 1950 Personal Arena Rating, weapons to 1800.<br>
There will be no changes to gear availability/rating requirement until Season 4 starts, which will not begin when patch 2.4 goes live.<br>
<br>
When Season 4 starts here&apos;s what will happen:<br>
Season 1 removed<br>
Season 2 moved to honor<br>
Season 3 rating requirements and prices lowered<br>
<br>
Shoulders : 1950 rating<br>
Weapons : 1800 rating<br>
Season 4 gear added<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Season 4 isn&apos;t expected to begin any time soon, but as always we plan to give at least a two week notice before it does. Stay tuned to these forums or any of your fine local fansites as I&apos;m sure the information will spread fairly rapidly once we do announce a Season 4 start date.<br>
<br>
Season 3 prices and Season 4 rating requirements are not yet announced. All information contained herein is of course, as always, subject to change.<br>
<br>
What about the S1 Gear being removed ?<br>
You get to keep your items of course, they&apos;ll just no longer be available for purchase from the vendors. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5286577719&amp;postId=53773201214&amp;sid=1#44))<br>

<br>
First &quot;real&quot; screenshot of Kil&apos;jaeden ?<br>
I got an interesting mail a few hours ago, with a nice screenshot attached. According to the sender this is a leaked screenshot from a GM, I won&apos;t fully confirm it but it definitely looks legit enough to be posted. Keep in mind that it could be a fake, it&apos;s not &quot;that&quot; hard to get the 2.4 running on an emulated server and spawn Kil&apos;jaeden, in this case his scale on live servers could be different.<br>
