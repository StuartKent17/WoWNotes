Blizzcon Day 1 - Pictures Update
Over the last few hours I added more than 350 pictures to the panels articles on the front page, make sure you check the previous news posts.

Also, here are a few extra screenshots and artworks from the Cataclysm press kit. Not resized because we're all going to make posters out of these artworks anyway.
