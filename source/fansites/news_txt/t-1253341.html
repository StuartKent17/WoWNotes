Patch 5.2 - New Frog Model and Pet Battle Tweets<br>
Mumper shared the new Frog model on Twitter (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/292088473123450880) recently, and apparently people are excited (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1252759-New-Frog-Model)! You can see the old frog model next to it for comparison. Only new frog pets will use this model, older ones will continue to use the older one. <br>
<br>

<br>
Next PTR push, transferred characters will get a random set of 25 max level pets to test with. Aki quest also flagged complete. Should help! Transferring your actual pets is very challenging since we copy chars, not accounts. This solution works nice though. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/292094715405422593))<br>
<br>
The issue with mech and undead not proccing their rez is a known bug and we plan to fix it in 5.2.0 (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/288347253159116800))<br>
<br>
CRZ and Scourged Whelpling... oops, amirite?<br>
Your prayers have been answered. We made a dramatic reduction to the respawn timer on these in 5.2.0. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/291265557334990849))<br>
<br>
In 5.2 the respawn is better for scourge whelpling. Will the same be applied to Minfernal? <br>
No changes to the Minfernal, we are happy with it&apos;s capture rate. Scourged whelp was way off, its similar to Minfernal now. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/291304090019975169))<br>
<br>
How much experience does an elite pet give (5.2) and can each individual boss (elite) pet be beaten once a day? Curious for leveling <br>
They give standard XP but their daily quest has a much higher chance to drop a rare battle-stone. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/291620784353456128))<br>
Ah cool so fables bag drops a pet and a stone (higher chance). If the fables bag can drop stones why doesn&apos;t the panda element bag? <br>
Spirit tamers give a massive multiplier to XP on their daily&apos;s already, no need for the stone. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/291672617524535297))<br>
<br>
That&apos;s interesting. Each time an Elite Battle Pet is despawned, it spawns in as a different level. Bug? Still legendary quality though. <br>
Different levels each time is a bug, fixed in next build. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/291007406790565888))<br>
<br>
So uh, stupid question but can multiple people battle an Elite Pet at the same time? Unlike Tamer teams, it despawns when you forfeit/lose. <br>
Despawn on elite pets is a bug, fixed in next build to work like normal tamers. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/291007328696815618))<br>
<br>
Especially curious about Stunted Direhorn and Zandalari Hatchling. Figuring out if the raid pets come from mobs or bosses would be neat too. <br>
Plan is to have bonus rolls work for raid boss pets. Currently 2 of those and one pet on raid trash. Currently plan is that they will drop as normal loot and on bonus rolls. Stunted Direhorn (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94191-stunted-direhorn) is not 5.2 anymore, most likely 5.3 at this point. We have a cool replacement though! That was just a scaled down direhorn, no wonder it looked good! Shooting for a custom model in 5.3.0 (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/291005979405987840))<br>
<br>
Are battle pet collections intended to not transfer to the PTR? Very tough to test if we have to start from scratch on the PTR. <br>
We currently do not have tech to move pets with characters since the pets are account based. We would like to solve this as well. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/290920329533067264))<br>
<br>
Any chance of seeing that Chain Pet Leash (http://www.wowdb.com/items/89139-chain-pet-leash) from the MoP beta again? Some of my pets are too... Aggressive for a rope one<br>
Never went away, it&apos;s still in the pet rewards bag from daily&apos;s. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/288400866258608129)) - (As far as we know, it is not actually in the bags (http://www.wowdb.com/items/89125-sack-of-pet-supplies#related:contains-item) anymore)<br>
<br>
Are Flawless Battle-Stones supposed to change the breed of a pet to a random one when upgrading? <br>
No, only affects quality. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/286956606116225024))<br>
<br>
Are epic battle stones planned to be implemented in 5.2? I didn&apos;t think they were, but I&apos;ve seen a couple people think otherwise. <br>
Nope, holding off on those a bit longer still. They will come along with epic pets at the same time most likely. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/288135077186134016))<br>
<br>
Will it be possible to get the new pets in LFR - for example son of animus and living sandling. It&apos;d sure give me a lot of incentive <br>
Yup, they are in all difficulties, including LFR. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/289315343854350337))<br>
<br>
Will we ever see skin-updates for old mounts, like we did with Gryphons and Wyverns? They look amazing! *Imagines Kodo like that* <br>
Always a chance if we have a good place to use them. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/288099311202492416))<br>
<br>
Drop rates on the new world boss mounts be more reasonable in 5.2?<br>
They will be the same as previous. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/288127119333158912))<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
Classes<br>
I feel that classes have been boiled down over the years. I&apos;d like to see more crazy incorporated into classes! #GhostlyStrike<br>
Me too. Class diversity is typically the enemy of class balance. Both are important though! (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/286527083381940225))<br>
<br>
Love how all mage specs are competitive. Need the same with locks, sick and tired of playing aff in PVE!<br>
Mages disagree that they are all competitive. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/286525116119130112))<br>
<br>
However MM is used as rarely - only to see that it still cant pull the weight.<br>
I&apos;m quite torn on how to fix multiple DPS specs. We used to think that a 5% delta was okay, but players still pick the highest. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/286524967036796930))<br>
<br>
More class/spec differentiation/flavor. Better UI/visualization of spells/buffs. Even more story and alliance wins<br>
Theoretically, how to add class differentiation without making X mandatory in small groups? Very tough for us to solve. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285915271418486786))<br>

Can I have more than 1 dk per server since they aren&apos;t a hero class anymore?<br>
We agree that limitation probably isn&apos;t necessary any longer. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287663340090716160))<br>
<br>
I mean Dks are just destroyed in PVP right now. I will pay for 10 mins of your time if you hear me out...seriously<br>
Destroyed by whom? Warriors and mages who are getting nerfed (more) in 5.2? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287277950284484608))<br>
<br>
Figured I&apos;d try asking again but is the way HB gets spammed by Frost DW in both single target and aoe considered fine by devs?<br>
We think it&apos;s borderline. Seems unfair to tell warriors they can&apos;t use WW single target but then let DKs do it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285915552701108224))<br>

resto druid can do nothing except hot,hot and hot.Do you think druid is designed using hot at all time?<br>
Ideally a lot of hots, but not 100%. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287644645272473605))<br>
<br>
What do you feel is the hardest healer to pvp balance? When I think about hots my mind hurts so Id say druids.<br>
Over the course of all expansions, I&apos;d say druids. It&apos;s the combo of hots + shifting + Cyclone. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287281779071647744))<br>

On Mages. Was increased mana regen from Tier6 talents a good choice? It only affects Arcane, making it &quot;double dib&quot; on them.<br>
On the whole, we&apos;re not sure. They are probably too focused on Arcane at the expense of Fire and Frost. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/286209735957565440))<br>
<br>
Greg do you think its possible to honestly get frostbolt back to Wrath stages? putting it on FoF and reduce cast time? please.<br>
Not crazy about reducing cast times on anything, but as you can see, we&apos;re still trying out various FoF design on PTR. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287641671569657856))<br>
<br>
Do you not think Scorch was mana management? What do you think we were using it for, our health?<br>
Isn&apos;t that the defense you could offer of any loophole? &quot;I liked this, because it let me get around limitations.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287282697179643904))<br>
We offer nothing but using talents to our advantage, which is what they r there for, no? It&apos;s not our fault, you made it.<br>
If the Scorch rotation is just that much fun, we could nerf Arcane DPS instead to account for being at 6 stacks so often. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287638940423438336))<br>
It&apos;s totally not your fault. Not sure where that is coming from. It&apos;s still our responsibility to fix it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287638771787251712))<br>
You made the tree and scorn us for using it to our advantage? Shame on you. We r suppose to manage mana right?<br>
So under that logic if you found a way to keep your crit rate at 100% and we fixed it, that is scorning you? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287638304957034496))<br>

Please consider making Divine purpose baseline. Even if it has a lower proc chance it would help sustained damage.<br>
We heard from a lot of paladins who hated DP. A talent seemed like a good solution. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/286525549281681409))<br>
no paladin in their right mind would complain about divine purpose, a free 3 paladin proc come on?<br>

Why is Holy Radiance costing 21.6k Mana when you removed Judgement of the Pure and Replenishment<br>

cont. Why not cap it (Divine Aegis) at 40%, but allow larger single heals to create larger shields?<br>
Yeah potentially. It&apos;s largely a problem that using all AEs reigns supreme in 25s but single targets are great for 10s. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287645587040518145))<br>

Holy PVP- should it be viable? Any comment on the current low number of healer priests (both holy and disc) on all ladders?<br>

New and existing players are going to choose classes that fit their playstyle AND give them options. Rogues only do one thing.<br>
Do you really think it&apos;s a ranged vs melee thing? Many DPS shaman e.g. don&apos;t swap Enh to Ele all the time. Pure vs hybrid? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/286519471147974657))<br>
<br>
Do you think there might be just a bit too much passive damage going on with rogues now? That&apos;s what personally turned me off.<br>
To use FPS terms, the high auto+poison damage keeps rogues feeling like an SMG instead of a shotgun. Maybe time for a change? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/286199474722840577))<br>
if you&apos;re going to use fps terms don&apos;t you think a rogue should be more like a sniper rather than a shotgun<br>
Snipers have very low ROF though. They also tend to be complained about in FPS for the same reasons - uncounterable burst. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287648884287758336))<br>
in most games sniping takes more skill, which makes the good players not mind its extra power<br>
You and I read different FPS forums. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287670002226700291))<br>
<br>
While I&apos;m quite happy with how my rogue plays (I roll assassination), the analogy you make is pretty spot-on.<br>
And I&apos;m not saying the SMG feel is a bad design. Watching bars chew away quickly can be entertaining too. Diversity is good. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/286522760690270208))<br>

GC do you think arms rotation feels a little too unpredictable? I understand fury being unpredictable but why arms?<br>
The 5.2 change to Taste for Blood removes one source of RNG. Sudden Death will still provide a break from monotony. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/286196625083334657))<br>
<br>
On PTR, Taste for Blood comes at level 20, but Overpower at level 30. Kind of hard to use TfB without the ability it procs<br>

Just tried Arms on the PTR. V. Boring. Needs another proc/dot/thing to track. MS&gt;OP&gt;OP&gt;Slam+CS is just dull. Needs salt.<br>
Are you sure you&apos;re Slamming at the right time? It shouldn&apos;t always follow dual OPs AFAIK. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287275493479288833))<br>
It feels unfinished, uninspired, bland, it needs another button to press, another mechanic, something else, a random element.<br>

PvE<br>
the ilvl requirements for 5.2 LFR = too high, especially w/out new 5 mans. Running 5.2 dailies for weeks for new gear = no fun<br>
What about 5.0 LFR? There are 5 you can run a week. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287650784521363456))<br>
<br>
What is with the 1 hr.+ long DPS queues for LFR?<br>
Typically, it&apos;s not enough healers queuing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287651539076673536))<br>

however, the Asian special version iLV for 25-raids really forced Asian players feel to switch to 25s over an over again<br>
Asian players overwhelmingly told us they liked having dual lockouts. In EU and NA some love it, some hate it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/286522292895354880))<br>
<br>
Too many times I&apos;m in LFR where 1/3 of the healers are in dps spec and dpsing, leaving us with 3 healers. How to stop this?<br>
There are 2 issues. One, we don&apos;t have an offspec LFR loot system yet. Two, the fights don&apos;t often need that much healing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287259751744696320))<br>

I&apos;ve been playing mmo since UO beta. Your idea ruins my enjoyment. You guys can do heroic mode. Leave 10m for casual<br>

Tears of boredom is all we have from Galleon. Waiting hours in hopes of his spawn isn&apos;t a challenge. It&apos;s stupid.<br>
Which is why the 5.2 boss will be different. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287648964176670720))<br>

what happened to 7 dungeon runs per week for valor, can we have this back instead of having to daily for 80 valor?<br>
Old model: 7 per week but 8th useless. New model, 1 a day then as many as you want for less. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287644982909730818))<br>
Strongly prefer 7x/wk. Can&apos;t play weekdays much, like to grind on weekends. Its was fun for me in cata<br>
You can still do that. The runs after the first still give valor. It&apos;s not the most efficient way possible, but totally works. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287671444215848960))<br>

it&apos;s something only HC raiders (a minority of the raiders) would say, or someone with more time than skill.<br>
HC raiders tend to do content anyway. It&apos;s more casual raiders who drop out if rewards and prestige are lacking. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287641222468747264))<br>
Really? Often when i read forums i think its hc raiders who leave the game if they did the content.<br>

PvP<br>
I have pvp gear stashed in the bank from Sha which I don&apos;t use because I don&apos;t pvp.<br>
That&apos;s okay. Hopefully there are some players who look at a couple of PvP pieces and decide to give it a try. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287638585404952576))<br>
<br>
The problem for PVP is you listen to 1500 players. Balance for 2.2, or wherever the T2 cutoff is if its changed<br>
Aren&apos;t you kind of saying that unskilled players don&apos;t deserve a fun game? Or are they just too ignorant to grasp issues? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287670534559367170))<br>
<br>
I&apos;m reading the 5.2 PTR notes, and it looks like monks are going to be like DK&apos;s in season 5... Your thoughts?<br>
We hope not, but monks are so absent from PvP right now that we fear the solutions need to be dramatic, not subtle. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285916795347558401))<br>

CC DRs, pvp power, and class burst CDs all need to be heavily looked at. Is it going to be 6.0 before these issues are fixed?<br>

Please tell me that there&apos;s a global resilience buff coming in 5.2? PVP damage is actually absurd (_ALL_ classes/specs).<br>
We don&apos;t think damage is too high, just a few outliers. Q: How long should it take to kill someone? How long does it take now? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/286521260631027712))<br>

I don&apos;t think they&apos;re too complex, but macro&apos;ing is integral to any class&apos; peak performance (rightfully, imo).<br>
Yeah it&apos;s pretty hard to be optimal in PvP without macros for any class, but I&apos;m not sure that&apos;s something we need to fix. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285911732914909184))<br>

Character<br>
Hello Mr. Street. Isn&apos;t that unfair that all old PvP art is unavailable to PvE players while all old PvE art is to PvP&apos;ers?<br>

Just come up with a mechanic that allows people with mains to catch up faster on their alts.<br>

I like the idea of leveling a toon and being able to swap classes. (A la FFXI) and more invested more returned.<br>

<br>
Wait, so it&apos;s ok to make us burn out by running the same content for months? Bad drops? No drops? ICC anyone?<br>
It&apos;s a balance. Finishing a raid in 2 weeks (because you have all the loot) is as lame as grinding it for 8 months. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/286523313860251648))<br>

<br>
V. of the A- any chance the 1k VP trigger could be obtained on multiple characters to spread the load, instead of just one?<br>
Problem with that is now you should constantly swap characters to benefit from &quot;first of the day&quot; bonuses and not play your main. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287648140276953088))<br>

How come we cant put MOP LFR and tier items in Void storage? (not upgraded)<br>
At the moment, it would strip the upgrades from the items. We are fixing it for 5.2 and you can use Void Storage on them as expected. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285157567494250496))<br>

So then what you are considering is to get all secondary stats very close in value and remove hit/exp?<br>
Or keep reforging, but axe hit/exp from the game. Choosing haste vs. crit is less mathy and more (though not 100%) about style. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285146321457913856))<br>

Many players actually enjoy playing with the reforge feature. If its not fun for you, dont use it.<br>
Can you explain what&apos;s fun about it for you? In my experience, many players use a spreadsheet etc. to make the decisions for them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285145863611904000))<br>

Would it be technically difficult to let us choose reforging amounts? E.g. only reforging 122 hit instead of the maximum 187<br>

You wiped out all talents, made new ones. Thats like a 100% swing. Ring of Frost is a talent, LOL!<br>
