Legion - Dev Q&A Today
Check back later today for the first weekly Legion Dev Q&A! We'll be recapping it for those of you unable to watch. 
As we announced on our blog, we’re starting up a series of Live Developer Q&As taking place every Thursday at 11 a.m. PT for the next several weeks. You’ll be able to tune in live at Twitch.tv/Warcraft 

You can submit your questions via Twitter by using the hashtag #LegionQA, or simply by replying to this forum thread. For our first session, we’ll be talking with Assistant Game Director Ion Hazzikostas, and there are no restrictions on topic—as long as it’s related to the Legion expansion, fire away!

Please keep in mind that we want to make sure we get to as many questions as possible, so try to keep it short. We’ll only consider questions that use 40 words or less.


Warcraft Movie - China Box Office Update
The Warcraft Movie continues to drop off in China, with the total now at $169.5M 


  


Raid Testing Schedule - June 17-20
On Friday, June 17, and Monday, June 20, we will continue our Legion raid testing.

Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Mythic, of course, requires 20 and does not scale.

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.


Demon Invasion Event Test June 16-17
With thanks to all testers who participated in our demon invasion Beta test last week, we're going to have another.

On Thursday, June 16, starting at 10:00 a.m. PDT, we will activate a demon invasion realm in the Legion Beta. This Beta realm will be dedicated to testing the pre-expansion demon invasion event with as many testers as possible for approximately 24 hours, and we expect to remove the realm after 24 hours have elapsed.

We ask that all Beta testers please join us in focusing testing on the demon invasion realm when it is available. Other Beta realms will not be available during this 24-hour test.

Please direct your pre-Legion event feedback to the Beta General Discussion forum, and please direct any feedback you have about other Legion subjects to the appropriate dedicated subforum.

Thank you very much! We’ll see you at the defense of Azeroth!


Current PTR Content Available
Hello PTR Testers,

Currently the PTR does not have Demon Invasions active, and Broken Shore and the follow-up quests are disabled as well; this is intended. This content may be enabled at a later time as testing progresses.

The important things that you can help us test out feedback and bugs on the PTR realms right now are things like:
Transmog Changes and the Appearance Tab Spell and Talent Changes PvP and Honor Changes Other System Changes like Class Specializations and Glyph System Engine Changes New System Settings and Graphics Options 

Also if you haven't yet, check out the PTR Patch Notes for more info!


PTR Character Copy
The Character Copy button is present in the current PTR build and characters from your retail account are listed, but we're still working to get the copy process finalized so you'll likely run into "Copy Failed" errors.

We're working on resolving this but I don't have a current ETA to provide. I'll provide updates as we continue work on this.


Blood of Sargeras Sources
Blood of Sargeras  is a BoP Legion crafting reagent. There aren't many ways to earn it outside of gathering and occasional world quests, but that is changing. 
Hi friends - I just wanted to chime in that in the next beta build you should see more Blood of Sargeras dropping from non-tradeskill sources dungeons, in particular.


Blue Posts
Court of Stars and Class Hall Campaigns
So are warriors still going to have their class quests need these dungeons. If so, this seems poorly thought out. Mythic groups usually have Ilvl requirements, and seeing as the gating of the class quest will prevent us from having the third relic slot it will put us behind a little. Honestly I'd rather that the normal dungeons open up at an early rep, and where the quests need you to do something it requires heroic/mythic instance to complete and those modes be tied to higher difficulty.
Class Order campaign quests that currently send players into Suramar dungeons are being changed to target different dungeons - that should be visible in the next build. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Polymorph and DoT Removal
Ok as a mage you use poly to reset fights, I literally CANNOT do that now as a fire mage, because I can't wipe the dots I constantly place on the target with so many spells.
Actually, Polymorph should remove all damage over time effects when cast on targets in PvP. We've changed all crowd-control abilities that break from damage to clear damage over time effects when applied. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Legion Beta Blood Death Knight and Holy Paladin PvP
At the moment Hpals barely heal, they just run in pop wings and top the meters while keeping their group alive. Blood Dks on the other hand are simply immortal gods that deal way too much damage in particular with heart strike criting sometimes for over 700K.
Much of the blood DK damage was coming from the Honor talent "Blood for Blood" which we've toned down in an upcoming hotfix, and the talent will no longer remove the rune cost from Heart Strike. The idea of the talent is to give Blood DK's an option to increase their damage at the expense of a survivability loss most tank specs have an honor talent similar to this, it was just overtuned.

As for Holy Paladins, the honor talent "Avenging Light" was probably too good now that Holy Light heals for so much. We've toned that one down too, which should be live now.

Thanks for the feedback! Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Focused Testing - Player Collision
Greetings all, as you continue testing World Quests we would like to put a special focus on areas of player collision. These can often be some of the most frustrating issues to run into on day 1 of the expansion's launch, as I'm sure we've all experienced the line to kill the one boss or loot the one item you needed that wasn't flagged for multi-tap.

This includes, but is not limited to:

Single kill targets that are not multi-tap. Objects that are not multi-loot. Too few spawns of a type in an area. Too slow of a respawn time for spawns in an area.

Please let us know if you run into any of the above issues on a World Quest, thanks! Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Kirin Tor World Quests
There are a few issues with the Kirin Tor world quests, we're on top of them, they won't be fixed in today's build but should be by the next one. Thanks for all of the reports! Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Quest In the Blink of an Eye
This looks to be working properly after restarts!

Please re-try this if you were having problems earlier. You might need to drop the quest and pick it back up from Khadgar's Elemental Servant re-log if he doesn't pop up immediately. Then just run to the middle of Dalaran over Karazhan and you'll be on your way to New Dalaran! Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Quest 'The Fallen Lion' is Broken
We're looking into this as well, apologies for the delays it causes.

We're continuing to investigate into why this is broken on Beta Realms. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
