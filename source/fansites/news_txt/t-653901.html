<br>
Important - To clarify a few things, I decided to use the internal item database of MMO-Champion (http://db.mmo-champion.com) (yeah we actually have our own). Please keep in mind that even if most of the information is here it is not a real database and isn&apos;t meant to replace Wowhead or anything like that, it just helps having updated data during PTR testing. Also, it wasn&apos;t really supposed to go public and it&apos;s probably full of nasty bugs, we&apos;ll work on them. Please post feedback in this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=67292.0)<br>
<br>
Patch 3.2 now on PTRs<br>
Patch 3.2 is now available for download and I will update the site A LOT in the next few hours, stay tuned!<br>

World Environment<br>
Northrend Children&apos;s Week has arrived in Dalaran! Players can find out more by visiting the Eventide District.<br>

A new zeppelin docking ramp has been added to Thunder Bluff allowing Horde players easier transport to and from Orgrimmar.<br>
The local Postal Service has grown tired of walking so far each day to collect mail and has decided to install a large number of new mailboxes to Stormwind, Undercity, Darnassus and Orgrimmar.<br>
