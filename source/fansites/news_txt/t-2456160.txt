AWC and MDI Competitive Rulings
The World of Warcraft Arena World Championship AWC and Mythic Dungeon Invitational MDI programs operate via official rulesets, which were established in order to set expectations around the rules of tournament play and structure, player eligibility, points, prizes, sponsorships, and player conduct. All players accept these rules in order to participate in our tournaments and are expected to abide by them at all times.

We take all violations seriously. This page will be updated as new competitive rulings are issued.
