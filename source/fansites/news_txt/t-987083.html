Legendary Dagger Preview - Fangs of the Father<br>
Blizzard released a preview of the legendary daggers, with finally extra info on the wings. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
These powers include a stacking increase to Agility which builds until dark wings unfurl from the rogue&#x2019;s back, removing the combo point cost and increasing damage of finishing moves for a short time.<br>
In addition, the wings which can be spread on command (with no combat benefit) to slow a rapid descent, allowing the rogue to slowly fall to the ground<br>
<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They wanted to hold me, to keep watch over me &#x2013; a prisoner in all but name. But I will NOT be held accountable for the sins of my father. My destiny will be my own.&#x201D;- Wrathion, the Black Prince<br>
<br>
The Contract<br>
<br>
Patch 4.3 will offer the most deadly and experienced rogues the opportunity to finally play a central role in the fate of the world the rogue&#x2019;s way: by manipulating key events from the shadows. Players will travel across continents to accomplish crucial missions of reconnaissance, burglary, infiltration and, of course, assassination. Those familiar with the events that unfolded in the Badlands since the Cataclysm struck may recall the story of Rheastrasza, the ambitious red dragon who acquired a black dragon egg and magically purified it, cleansing it of the Black Dragonflight&#x2019;s corruption. While those events may lead to a more hopeful destiny for Azeroth, it will take cleverness, stealth, skill, and the help of a few friends to unravel the web of intrigue that will reveal what became of the egg&#x2026; and determine the fate of Deathwing himself.<br>

Wetwork<br>
<br>
Rogues willing to do whatever is necessary to ignite a brighter future must first delve into the Dragon&#x2019;s Soul raid dungeon to begin the quest line. Those who prove their prowess within will be set on a collision course with Ravenholdt Manor and the enigmatic Black Prince, Wrathion. This shadowy figure could be the key to victory for the mortal races, but what is his true agenda? Before the truth behind these mysteries are revealed, enterprising assassins will need to fight tense raid battles against Deathwing&#x2019;s most powerful minions, and embark alone on perilous missions to seal the fate of the Black Dragonflight. The quest culminates in the earth-scorching execution of Deathwing himself and a shocking revelation about the true nature of the mission.<br>

<br>
What&#x2019;s in it for me?<br>
<br>
Rogues who succeed will receive a paired set of daggers that will become increasingly lethal as their bearer progresses along the legendary quest. At the height of their strength, they will be imbued with the vile essence of the Old Gods, as well as the maddened fury of the Black Dragonflight -- bestowing great power upon their bearer. These powers include a stacking increase to Agility which builds until dark wings unfurl from the rogue&#x2019;s back, removing the combo point cost and increasing damage of finishing moves for a short time. In addition, the wings which can be spread on command (with no combat benefit) to slow a rapid descent, allowing the rogue to slowly fall to the ground&#x2026; or enact a little death from above! When it comes to dealing death, the Fangs of the Father promise legendary killing power to rogues of any specialization.<br>
<br>
An incredible adventure and legendary rewards await. The future of all life on Azeroth hangs in the balance. Better get moving.<br>

Priest Tier 13 and Visual Retrospective<br>
Blizzard released their preview of the Priest Tier 13 and confirmed the site datamined a few hours ago. <br>
Adventurers will be tested like never before in 4.3 as they take on Deathwing and his minions, emerging with powerful new treasures. Please enjoy this preview of the priest tier 13 set, as well as a visual guide to tiers 1 through 12 for Transmogrification purposes.<br>

Vestments of Dying Light<br>
<br>
Priests (and paladins for that matter) are often the most challenging classes to design &#x2018;badass&#x2019; armor sets for, in contrast to the death knight and warlock, whose underlying concepts demand the unquestionably cool dark and sinister approach.<br>
<br>
In this instance, however, the design asked for a bold, two-tone, &#x2018;Venetian carnival style with creepy, soulless black eyes,&#x2019; which gave me a powerful, potentially edgy direction to explore. The set&#x2019;s &#x2018;Dying Light&#x2019; theme was visualized as a spiked, setting sun motif.<br>
