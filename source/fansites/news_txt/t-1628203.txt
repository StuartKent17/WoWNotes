Warcraft Movie Presentation http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4485-Warcraft-Movie-Presentation

People actually at Blizzcon saw a short teaser trailer, but the video won't be released online https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/530887786233348096.
The movie will follow heroes on both factions, "50% Alliance, 50% Horde".
The visual effects are very realistic. Motion capture was used, the team worked with ILM to make it feel as much like live action as possible.
Effects are Avatar and Lord of the Rings at the same time.
Very detailed sets were built, such as part of Stormwind's main street.
A partial list of the cast was released.

World of Warcraft - Items, Class Changes, and More http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4486-World-of-Warcraft-Items-Class-Changes-and-More

A recap of Warlords changes.

Warlords of Draenor Cinematic Intro Panel http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4493-Warlords-of-Draenor-Cinematic-Intro-Panel

Blizzard has a new group called The Forge that will be focused on telling stories in the Blizzard universe.
In one cinematic idea, Chromie could have a vision of what is happening in Draenor as a flashback.
The team uses live video references to create the cinematic shots.
The silhouette of the Warlords was mostly done by using existing assets, as the models of the Warlords models weren't done.
Sin City was the original art style reference for Lords of War.

World of Warcraft Q + A Panel http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4496-World-of-Warcraft-Q-A-Panel - Notes have been cleaned up from the live recap

Farahlon may or may not make it into a content patch. The team isn't sure yet, which is why it was removed from the map. At one point they considered using it as a separate area for boosted players, but Tanaan Jungle for everyone felt like the better choice.
The team can make one click milling and prospecting if it is something players want.
Social content like AQ gates opening is great, but it crashed the servers. One person being a hero and representing the server is something cool that can be done.
New armor designs and silhouettes is something the team is talking about. They are drawing it up and coming with ideas. No solid release date yet.

World of Warcraft: Looking for Group Documentary http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4497-World-of-Warcraft-Looking-for-Group-Documentary

If you are interested in WoW, you should watch this. A recap won't do it justice http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1627920-World-of-Warcraft-Looking-for-Group-Documentary?p=30505860&viewfull=1#post30505860.

Overwatch Unveiled http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4481-Overwatch-Unveiled

Chris Metzen is only doing one voice in this game.
The game will be accessible and have options other than putting a crosshair over someone.
You should die less frequently than in current modern military shooters.
Initially only on PC.
No pricing model yet.

Overwatch Press Kit http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4482-Overwatch-Press-Kit

Cinematic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqnKB22pOC0&feature=player_embedded and Gameplay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dushZybUYnM&feature=player_embedded trailers released, along with videos of each hero's skills on the website http://us.battle.net/overwatch/en/.
Lots of art and screenshots.

Overwatch - Origins http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4491-Overwatch-Origins

Overwatch uses a new engine with new technology.
Warcraft started out very simple and then added in new characters, story, and art over time. Overwatch is starting from the same place, a simple beginning and lots of potential for the future in terms of story and characters.
The team wanted Tracer to be the centerpiece hero, as everyone on the team loved her.
No real answer to if there will be collectable hats.
The game has some similarities to TF2, but it is still a very different game. TF2 has a limited number of roles with some more customization through weapon choices. Overwatch also has some more mobility, with some heroes that can fly or use grapple hooks. Overwatch is more about hero abilities than it is about putting a crosshair over the other heroes.

Hearthstone: Fireside Chat http://www.hearthpwn.com/news/675-blizzcon-2014-new-expansion-announced-goblins-vs

The Goblins and Gnomes expansion is launching December 2014. It has 120 cards and spectator mode for friends.

<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/october/hotsIcon.png" style="margin-bottom:-2px; margin-right:0px; vertical-align:bottom" /> Heroes of the Storm

Heroes of the Storm Overview http://www.heroesnexus.com/news/1238-blizzcon-2014-heroes-panel-live-update

Draft mode is coming, with no duplicate heroes and no bans.
Ranked play is coming with two leagues: Hero league any size group queue and Team league fixed size teams only. There are seasons, points, and a separate skill rank. 
Leavers - If you leave games too often, you will only be matched with other people that leave games too often. You can undo this by not leaving games.

Sound of the Nexus http://www.heroesnexus.com/news/1239-blizzcon-2014-sound-of-the-nexus-panel-recap

Back in Warcraft III, the average lines a unit spoke was just 20. For Heroes, its 300! 
Chain Lightning was created with fireworks, and a tape measure.

Heroes of the Storm Deep Dive http://www.heroesnexus.com/news/1240-blizzcon-2014-heroes-of-the-storm-deep-dive

There should be a core, awesome mechanic for each battleground. Changes the flow of gameplay.
Sky Temple takes place in a brand new universe, never before seen in another Blizzard game.
Tomb of the Spider Queen takes place in the save universe as sky temple. Is an interior battleground, the first one! It's spooky.

Heroes Developer Interview http://www.heroesnexus.com/news/1241-blizzcon-heroes-developer-interview-with-kaeo

Lost Vikings are the first Insane Difficulty hero.
Bounties, part of the kill streak system, are still on the list of things to do.
No current plans for any story mode stuff like Starcraft campaigns.
The Heroes development team is Team 1, the same team which creates Starcraft II. They're currently working on Legacy of the Void and Heroes at the same time.
Both games have dedicated content designers, and artists, but share some systems people. People move around a bunch, but there's normally 100 people working on Heroes.

Introducing the next World of Warcraft companion up soon for adoption in the Battle.net Shop: Argi! This impossibly cute little creature will jump into your heart and nibble at your Blue Woolen Socks. She’s ready to help guide you through the savage lands of Draenor, climbing, swimming, and running wherever you go. Argi will be ready for a home this December, right in time for Winter Veil—just don’t get too upset if she chomps through the wrapping paper.

For every Argi pet purchased between December 3 and December 31, 100% of the adoption fee $10 in the U.S.; pricing varies by region will be donated in support of the American Red Cross http://www.redcross.org/ to assist in Ebola relief efforts http://www.redcross.org/ebolaoutbreak, helping enable the Red Cross to provide assistance to those in need.
