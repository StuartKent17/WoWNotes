Interviews: Warcraft After Cataclysm<br>
Tom Chilton and Greg Street have been making the rounds again with interviews on IGN (http://pc.ign.com/articles/119/1191590p1.html) and Gamasutra (http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6473/world_of_warcraft_and_life_after_.php).<br>
<br>
Patch 4.3<br>
<br>
If you add up all of the Deathwing encounter stages, it will be the longest fight in the game.<br>
Each stage of the fight will take place in a different location and offer some loot.<br>
The encounter starts at Wyrmrest Temple, progressing toward the players being on Deathwing&apos;s back while he is flying toward The Maelstrom.<br>
The new five man encounters will build up to the Deathwing fight, similar to how the Icecrown five man instances built up to the Lich King.<br>
To combat the complaints of armor always looking the same, there is a sub-lead who is in charge of guiding the art team to produce new styles not found in the game yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
After Cataclysm<br>
<br>
More armor customization could be coming in the future; Transmogrification was a solution that could be finished in time for Patch 4.3.<br>
After Patch 4.3, and the world event, the team is going to focus on keeping players entertained and enjoying the game as well as new and potentially returning players.<br>
On Mists of Pandaria: &quot;Most of the time when we do anything panda-related it&apos;s going to be a comic book or a figurine or something like that.&quot; <br>
There are more people that played World of Warcraft but no longer play World of Warcraft than currently play World of Warcraft<br>
They believe that each spec plays like a separate class, making the game feel as if there are 30 classes. <br>
Player created content is still in the back of their minds because of how well it worked in Starcraft II. Developing tools for players would take a lot of work, but the reward would be great as well.<br>

Worgen Mounts<br>
These mounts are mainly being added to even up the number of mounts Alliance players can get, compared to Horde players. Mount collectors and those of you interested in going for the mount achievement have been asking for this for a while, and the additional horses will address that issue.<br>
<br>
The Worgen&apos;s unique racial mount equivalent is the Running Wild skill. That&apos;s not going anywhere. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/195692/just-what-you-worgen-lovers-wanted) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2601293374?page=4#67))<br>
<br>
Transmogrification: Incomplete tier sets<br>
This is going to be half the fun for a lot of people looking forward to Transmogrification; finding matching sets and combinations that look awesome together<br>
<br>
While it&apos;s too early to say for sure, it&apos;s possible that after this feature launches, there will be a number of items that people request become available to Transmogrify. We&apos;re going to monitor this feedback and hopefully be able to build on the feature based on that, however, that&apos;s not to say every item people ask for will suddenly appear in the game.

<br>
Three Talent Specs<br>
Indeed, as Xarthat said, we&apos;re still really keen for players to put a lot of thought and decision into their character&apos;s chosen talent specs.<br>
<br>
Sure, it would be handy to have more specs lined up to swap in or out when faced with a different situation, but right now we feel that your talent spec(s) should be something you choose, maybe refine over time, and hopefully pwn with.

Diablo III Beta Opt In<br>
It is almost time for Diablo III Beta, Blizzard posted another beta opt in reminder on the official blog and DiabloFans (http://www.diablofans.com/) has some additional leaked gameplay to go with the screenshots below. <br>
Interested in signing up for an advance look at Diablo&#x2019;s coming invasion of Sanctuary? To be eligible to participate in the Diablo III beta test, you need an active Battle.net account with any Blizzard game title attached to it. If you don&#x2019;t already have an account, it&#x2019;s easy to create (http://us.battle.net/account/creation/tos.html) one. Once you&#x2019;ve set up a Battle.net account, or if you&#x2019;ve already got one, you can access it by visiting http://us.battle.net/en/ and clicking the Account button on the upper right. Then, to opt into the beta, just click the Games &amp; Codes section of your Account Management page, and then select the Beta Profile Settings (https://www.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html) option from the drop-down menu. You&#x2019;ll be prompted to download the System Check beta opt-in application; running it will opt you in to the Diablo III beta. If your system specifications change, you can run the System Check application again to update your information.<br>
<br>
While running the System Check application doesn&#x2019;t guarantee you a place in the Diablo III beta, we wish you luck and hope to see you in Sanctuary.<br>
<br>
FAQ:<br>
How are beta test participants selected from the opt-in pool?<br>
Beta testers are chosen according to their system specifications and other factors, including an element of luck. Our goal is to have a good variety of system types to best test compatibility.<br>
<br>
Will there be any other ways to get into the beta besides the opt-in?<br>
We&#x2019;ll very likely be providing beta entry giveaways through various promotions on our sites, as well as through our official fansites. We&#x2019;ll have information available on these promotions as they approach.<br>
<br>
How many players do you plan to invite to the beta test?<br>
The number of players we invite will be based on our testing needs. If during the course of testing we determine we need more players to participate, we&#x2019;ll invite more.<br>
<br>
What game content will be available in the beta?<br>
You&#x2019;ll be able to try out all five character classes and experience the early stages of Diablo III from the start of the game through the Skeleton King encounter. You&#x2019;ll be able to interact with new and returning characters in New Tristram and fight the reawakened evils emanating from the cursed Tristram Cathedral.<br>
<br>
Will the PvP arenas be available in the beta?<br>
We don&#x2019;t plan to include the PvP arenas in the beta test.<br>
<br>
How long will the beta test last?<br>
We have not determined an exact date for the end of the beta test. We will notify participants when the beta test is nearing completion.<br>
<br>
Will the Diablo III Auction House be available in the beta?<br>
We currently plan to test the functionality of the Diablo III gold-based auction house sometime after the initial beta launch.<br>
<br>
Will Mac users be able to participate in the beta?<br>
Yes, Mac users will be able to participate in the beta at the same time as Windows users.<br>
