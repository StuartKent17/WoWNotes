Armory Stats - Proving Grounds<br>
Today we are taking a look at the proving grounds achievement completion rate of players. The data used today is a sample of 6.1 million characters from 3.1 million accounts. We also did this at the end of Mists of Pandaria, which you can see here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4556-Armory-Stats-Mists-of-Pandaria-Proving-Grounds-Blue-Tweets-Blizzard-Art). <br>
<br>
It appears that many more people did proving grounds thanks to the minimum requirement for heroic dungeons, but less people have gotten around to doing Endless this time around. The number of healers and tanks is somewhat more even now<br>
<br>
You can see scoreboards on WoWProgress for DPS (http://www.wowprogress.com/char_statistics/field.pg_damage), Healing (http://www.wowprogress.com/char_statistics/field.pg_healer), and Tank (http://www.wowprogress.com/char_statistics/field.pg_tank) endless.<br>
<br>
A Monk recently got to wave 230 of Tank Endless and shared a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4T-FHGbQRI). Be sure to leave any requests for stats you want to see in the comments!<br>

Blue Posts<br>
Runesaber Mount<br>
Where is it?<br>
Grooming. We&apos;ll let you know when it&apos;s ready to make its way into Azeroth proper. (You know how cats can be.)<br>
<br>
but I can&apos;t help a feeling a sense of condescending attitude with that remark.<br>
I can assure you there was no condescension in my post at all. I think it&apos;s very easy for people to extrapolate what they like out of text sometimes, but if you were familiar with my style of communication, you&apos;d understand. This was merely my way of skirting &quot;soon&quot; and letting people know it&apos;s not a forgotten thing. We&apos;ll get everyone the information when we are all clear to do so. Don&apos;t worry.

<br>
World Bosses<br>
There are world bosses that you can kill weekly. I do one a week and I find groups by the premade group finder.<br>
This. There are often quite a few premade groups looking for people to do these bosses. Perhaps what you aren&apos;t seeing is people in chat asking for more people since they&apos;re using this system instead? (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/366057-world-bosses/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16774227461?page=1#4))<br>
<br>
Clicking Abilities<br>
I click one-off, raid cooldown and/or super rarely used abilities I keep in smaller bars above my keybound action bars. I don&apos;t particularly want to create yet another modifier key, or attempt to contort my hand just to reach bizarre binds I rarely use. It works for me, I do just fine, and I&apos;m not involved in any situations where it adversely affects my performance relative to the content I&apos;m involving myself in. I think if you get into a situation though where you&apos;re attempting to increase your performance, or underperforming and wondering why, then certainly keybinds and quick use of abilities can make a big difference. But, at least personally, I&apos;m not looking to break any records in Normal mode progression.<br>
<br>
When you have direct contact with developers and have been a forum poster for 10 years, do you really want to admit all you do is normal (flex) mode? How.. odd.<br>
If someone wants to openly expose that they are judgmental of how others choose to enjoy a form of entertainment, then I&apos;m not going to stop them. It&apos;s helpful to understand who people are.

WoW Tokens<br>
Opinions (on inflation)?<br>
I won&apos;t speculate on economic impact, but one thing I find interesting to ponder is where the wealthy acquired their wealth from, and if any wealth lost/spent won&apos;t just be reacquired from those same sources.<br>
<br>
I will add, I suspect Blizzard is going to price the tokens higher for the buyers than the sellers receive to create a gold sink they can adjust at will. So they will have a handle on inflation.<br>
The gold price is dynamic based on supply and demand. Aside from setting a starting gold price when the system is first turned on, the fluctuating cost is determined by the market.

Art<br>
Hi, all my friends and I loved the Human/Orc HD armor. Any plan to do more in the future, say all racial city guards armor?<br>
It&apos;s a big art job, made sense for garrisons because you had human/orc guards by default, we&apos;ll see what happens in the future! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/578788297448648704))<br>

Character / Items<br>
Could it be possible for tier tokens to show warforged/socket/tertiary before they are consumed?<br>
Due to technical limitations, we don&apos;t have plans for this at this time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578996377776091136))<br>
<br>
Please tell me that there are plans for other uses of Draenic Stone. I have been hoarding them in my reagent bank in hope.<br>
We gave them a good sell price, but at this time there are no other plans. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578996761718468608))<br>
<br>
Characters under lvl 100 can&apos;t see ore/herb/fur/etc. traders. By design? Alts are people too!<br>
You need a level 3 Garrison, but you can visit someone else&#x2019;s to pick these quests up before then. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578996951892414464))<br>
<br>
((Why does Darkmoon Adventurer&apos;s Guide not work in WoD content? Never see an artifact drop in instances.))<br>
That item is currently being revamped and will make its triumphant return very soon! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/579010411535593472))<br>

map goals concise on HotS load screen. I have no idea wtf the goal is in most wow pvp maps<br>
Yes I very much like their loading screens. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/579044733374242816))<br>

Wildstar - Companion Pets and Holo-Wardrobe<br>
Wildstar has some fun new additions in an upcoming patch. Non-combat companion pets are coming to the game, obtainable from many different sources. <br>
<br>
The new Holo-Wardrobe is also part of this patch. It allows you to save item appearances to an account wide list of appearances. You can edit a costume and swap the appearance in an item slot with any appearance you have unlocked for that slot. A similar system was mentioned for a future WoW update in previous developer interviews.<br>
