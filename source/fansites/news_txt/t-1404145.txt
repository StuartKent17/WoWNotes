Patch 5.4.2 - In-Game Store
Patch 5.4.2 adds a new UI to the in game store that will support many more categories than are currently used. After placing an order, you will receive an email and addition to your Battle.Net transaction history, just like any other store order. 

Right now it is using the experience boost potions as a test item, which are only for sale in Asian regions. There have been no announcements to indicate this will be changing anytime soon.

lack of tanks -> tank can not do anything with shiny new tank gear besides raid. Make tanks be able to quest properly
Tanks are pretty awesome at questing. Even healers aren't bad these days. Source 

what's a good fix then?
Weaking temp stats boosts makes both the boosts and dot snapshotting less interesting. Source 
we don't like wild dps swings cause of uncontrollable rng why is this so hard to understand
Neither do we. Dot snapshooting mattering so much was a major cause of this. "On the pull" uberness is another. Source 
We don't think the answer is no RNG though. Being able to react to RNG keeps combat from becoming rote and predictable. Source 

Anything to say about classes being homogenized prior to MoP classes felt like they each had a niche, now it all feels similar
I think that is fair, but too often before the answer was just bring X class and bench Y. We need a happy medium. Source 

I get you don't like the mod. Nevertheless, DoT specs are pointless when you remove snapshotting. No room for skill.
I don't think you're understanding my point. The mod is what you seem to be calling skill. There really isn't much skill. Source 
If there was no mod and you had to learn from experience when to refresh, then I might buy it. Source 

Any plans to reduce number of spells? Failed finger acrobatics is frustrating. Ignoring spells too. 10% too many?
We would like to, but is a controversial proposition. Every spell is someone's favorite. Source 

Vengeance was a mistake from the start. Tanking never felt so boring in Vanilla/TBC as it does now. Threat should matter.
Threat is only fun for the tank, not for the rest of the group who just feel throttled if threat is ever in question. Source 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
and exactly how often does "more DPS" become optional when talking about guilds pushing players to minmax?
If you die all the time from not moving out of stuff, then you are doing much less DPS than taking the talent. Source 

How do you feel Focus has worked out for Hunters? It feels very, very short term for decisions. Mana let you plan ahead more.
We like it overall, in that a resource that expires in an encounter feels bad for DPS. But we do like hunters resource driven. Source 
I think we were too generous with base focus return, which meant that at high gear levels you can ignore focus. Source 

Maybe I missed this, but is Snipe targetable or not? "Carefully Line Up" infers not.
The intent is that it is targetable. The line up bit is just to explain why you can't move. Source 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
are paladins ever going to get their auras back? they just feel like glorified warriors without them and it made them unique.
In theory, perhaps. In practice you just picked Devotion Aura unless you were mounted or had a particular resistance fight. Source 
Overall, there are precious few examples where the "pick one of this mode" mechanic really works for classes. Source 
Flavor over function. IMO, not everything about every class must be spreadsheet-approved.
I agree, but the swing was quite large. In order for flavor > function to work, the delta can't be as big as old Devo. Source 
Otherwise, it's not flavor. It's just playing badly. Source 

Hi, just asking out of curiosity, do you have any plans on putting Divine intervention back?
No. It was very buggy and mostly seemed popular because it skirted repair bills, which doesn't feel very heroic. Source 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Are you planning to revamp Shadow priests? Their kit needs a good review in 6.0 
Pretty happy with them overall. We're open to things like banking orbs and removing games to start a fight with orbs. Source 
In other words, we will polish the mechanics but don't think they need a massive overhaul. Source 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Do you feel the Rshaman stacked niche has worked finally? Can we expect this niche to stick going into WoD?;o
They feel pretty good in 5.4 though we think Chain Heal was more fun when targeting mattered more. Source

Heeeeeeere’s Jaina!
Our very own Jaina Proudmoore, a.k.a Yami , will be accompanying us to DreamHack this year. Aside from guarding our booth against any rogue magical attacks, Jaina will be there to greet those of you who are brave enough to approach her. We’ll also be sending her on numerous perimeter checks, so feel free to say hi if you see her on her travels around the halls. She’s a huge Hearthstone fan, so why not challenge her to a battle?

Contests and Quests Galore
Epic goodies will be plentiful for valiant adventurers who participate in the thrilling competitions we’ll have set up at DreamHack. More details will follow soon, but here’s a glance at some of the main attractions:
