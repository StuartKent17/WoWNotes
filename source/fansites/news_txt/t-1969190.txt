Legion PvP Stat Templates in World PvP
Stat templates only work in instanced PvP like battlegrounds and arenas. Out in the world your stats come from your gear. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Vanilla PVP set and Transmog
Thanks for the info. 1 Small addition. Hunter Alliance transmog on my shaman. Its mail, but i cant transmog to it because its limited to hunter class. Will the Hunter transmog be avalable for me as well? Let me live the dream of the Golden Shaman
As it stands, this won't be possible as a Shaman can't equip gear with the Hunter class restriction. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Classes
Won't changing Tank self heals/shields to AP scaling bring back the problems that Vengeance/Resolve were meant to fix?
Those are solved other ways. This change doesn't affect that anyway. Was HP-based, now AP-based. Neither vary by inc dmg. Celestalon 

.Sorry, Could you please switch the BrM and Guardian crit passive?
Brewmaster already has a stat that gives avoidance. Celestalon

can you tell me if current lunar strike animation is a placeholder? since it's the same animation of stellar flare
Not placeholder; those are different visuals. Celestalon 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 
if a monk talents into mistwalk, is it intended to replace transcendence?
Yes. Celestalon 

PvE
Will there be a dmg/health bonus for MoP soloing similar to Cata/wrath etc? Just curious if that's in the works.
The existing bonuses are because Wrath/Cata items were squished; MoP items weren't. If we did another squish, we'd add a MoP bonus. WatcherDev 

Misc
Ya know, Sporebats are one of my favorite creatures we've ever made. Super interesting, thematic, animations are iconic, and great cuddlers. Celestalon
