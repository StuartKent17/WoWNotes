Legion PvP Stat Templates in World PvP
Stat templates only work in instanced PvP like battlegrounds and arenas. Out in the world your stats come from your gear. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/406146-legion-world-pvp-scaling/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742845325?page=1#4

Vanilla PVP set and Transmog
Thanks for the info. 1 Small addition. Hunter Alliance transmog on my shaman. Its mail, but i cant transmog to it because its limited to hunter class. Will the Hunter transmog be avalable for me as well? Let me live the dream of the Golden Shaman
As it stands, this won't be possible as a Shaman can't equip gear with the Hunter class restriction. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/405975-vanilla-pvp-set-and-transmogs/ / Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17610902111?page=1#8

Won't changing Tank self heals/shields to AP scaling bring back the problems that Vengeance/Resolve were meant to fix?
Those are solved other ways. This change doesn't affect that anyway. Was HP-based, now AP-based. Neither vary by inc dmg. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/710596309791727616

.Sorry, Could you please switch the BrM and Guardian crit passive?
Brewmaster already has a stat that gives avoidance. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/710603376493367296

can you tell me if current lunar strike animation is a placeholder? since it's the same animation of stellar flare
Not placeholder; those are different visuals. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/710600614422683649

if a monk talents into mistwalk, is it intended to replace transcendence?
Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/710599020578742272

PvE
Will there be a dmg/health bonus for MoP soloing similar to Cata/wrath etc? Just curious if that's in the works.
The existing bonuses are because Wrath/Cata items were squished; MoP items weren't. If we did another squish, we'd add a MoP bonus. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/710508734137503744

Misc
Ya know, Sporebats are one of my favorite creatures we've ever made. Super interesting, thematic, animations are iconic, and great cuddlers. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/710523088606253056
