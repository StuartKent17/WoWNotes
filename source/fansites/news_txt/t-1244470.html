Blue Tweets<br>
PvE<br>
He means the concept of going 5s-&gt;first raid tier-&gt;next raid tier-&gt;etc rather than old 5s-&gt;new 5s-&gt;latest raid tier.<br>
It&apos;s a balance. Catch up important, but invalidating players&apos; accomplishments too quickly / blatantly is very demotivational. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279767348779548672))<br>
<br>
Will LFR loot be role-based instead of spec-based soon? Popularity of queuing diff than spec seems to be growing each week.<br>
We&apos;d like a system where you can choose a different role for loot purposes, but we need a clean UI for it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279658905913667585))<br>
<br>
So the same as PVE then, living with your mistakes that is.<br>
It is totally accurate though that PvE gets much more testing from players on PTR / beta than PvP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279649736808624129))<br>
Many of the hunter changes, Fire mage, stuff like Divine Star and many bug fixes are PvE changes to fix our mistakes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279649633364500482))<br>
<br>
If I heal a 2nd, 3rd LFR during a week and use an Elder Charm, do I have a chance at loot? (Experience shows 100% gold)<br>
You should be able to use the Charm on every boss but Sha of Anger on multiple runs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279060007851540480))<br>
<br>
As someone who enjoys playing many classes how difficult can we expect 5.2 to be to access the new raids in LFR?<br>
If you have 5.0 LFR gear and a few valor pieces or upgrades, you should be fine. A new 90 can&apos;t jump into 5.2 LFR first though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280027148394307584))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Looking back to pre-BC, would you make the decision to add flying mounts again if you had the choice?<br>
Personally, no, but they are pretty cool. Convenience is fun, but I don&apos;t like that they make the world so safe. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280039411524182016))<br>
<br>
yes that maybe true, but you balance pvp around 3v3, where the most pvp is not played<br>
It&apos;s a compromise. 5s might offer the best experience theoretically but 2s are super convenient. So we balance 3s the most. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280043146434461696))<br>
<br>
Any thoughts on what WoW&apos;s greatest PvP success is?<br>
So many ways to measure that. A good tournament? A balanced comp? A fun season? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280040420413669378))<br>
<br>
Also, put all CC on same DR because when you are unable to control your character for 20 sec or more or until your dead is fun<br>
We talk about that a lot, but it&apos;s a huge change probably better suited for an expansion. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280039888844378112))<br>
<br>
With a few exceptions; healers most notably shouldn&apos;t be able to kill something 1vs1 if they can survive vs 2 dps.<br>
Depends if the healer is out DPSing the DPS dude or just outlasting them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280029687638548480))<br>
<br>
Something I&apos;ve always wondered is why caster CC has a damage threshold i.e. fear/hex, yet I can die in a single stun??<br>
Dmg threshold = if you have a spell in flight or didn&apos;t retarget quickly enough. Stuns are supposed to allow damage. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280028512159682562))<br>
<br>
World<br>
When people ask for MC or Kara or other updates, you ever wanna say &quot;We revamped in Cata, and you all lambasted us for it&quot;?<br>
I think some players like the redos and some don&apos;t. We&apos;ll try to keep balancing the two. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277170569722593282))<br>
<br>
How do you feel about flying/flying mounts? Happy with the implementation or if you could go back would you change things?<br>
Wish they were for long distance travel not for skipping fights. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279018363202707459))<br>
<br>
When will CRZ be removed so i can re-sub to WoW. Not going to play it with this so called feature.<br>
Unlikely to go anywhere. We think having lower level zones alive is important for the long term health of the game. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280030411957096448))<br>
<br>
Myself and many people are frustrated at the long spawn timer on the minfernal pet plus extra competition from CRZ. Thoughts?<br>
How do you suggest we balance rare with everyone wants one? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280027325679144960))<br>

So what you are saying here is that poor quality content is justified by having large quantities of it? Dailies, for example.<br>
That&apos;s not in fact what I said. I said players demand both, which is a challenge when content takes longer to make than to play. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278617849533198336))<br>
<br>
Just wanted to tell you I haven&apos;t logged on for 2 weeks now because I&apos;m tired of feeling compelled to do so, every day.<br>
What if you tried just logging in every 3rd day? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279065232654102528))<br>
I have a 9 hour job and have to get raiding, lfr, sha, galleon, dailies and valor capping done. No time, and feels like job#2 <br>
The intent is folks who want to play more can progress faster, but you can still make progress if you play less. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279648143279276032))<br>
Why tie it to progress at all? specially the raid kind? It feels &apos;mandatory&apos;, even a small upgrade to a non-hardcore<br>
If it doesn&apos;t provide some power benefit then it&apos;s not interesting to many players. We already have many no-power things to do. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280029452438749185))<br>
<br>
&quot;Do all the things&quot; simply isn&apos;t feasible for all players, nor should it be. Otherwise there&apos;s nothing to do for many.<br>
Yes, that is the goal. We understand though that optional vs. mandatory is a razor&apos;s edge. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279765490132455424))<br>
<br>
Finishing the last chapter now with a guildie. We&apos;re almost giddy as we discuss it. So damn cool!<br>
Personally, I think the episodic quest lines have proven a great storytelling technique. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280041480616292352))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
&quot;Given limited time&quot; is the key. I still like to read the forum discussions. I just don&apos;t have bandwidth to address it all. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275765260965773312))<br>
<br>
Love and respect to the programming team. Coding WoW has to be a significant challenge. Could we get a blog about that aspect?<br>
That would be a fantastic blog. So much more goes into code than most players imagine. Maybe someone will volunteer to write one. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275983454234095617))<br>
<br>
If I&apos;m not mistaken, Tom Chilton is still overall Game Director. In other words, Ghostcrawler&apos;s boss.<br>
Cory and I the two LDs. We report to Tom, the game director. Other LDs report to us. Structure not set in stone. Org pretty flat. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275983161421332480))<br>
<br>
Why don&apos;t you just admit you need help of us (players) to make a better game. Admit mistakes isn&apos;t a shame.<br>
We always need players&apos; help to improve the game! That doesn&apos;t mean ideas go from the forums / twitter into patch notes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276037570620702720))<br>
it&apos;s some sort of blizzard protocol to never admit mistakes. the dev for priests plays a druid for example<br>
See, I don&apos;t get that. We admit mistakes all the time: Avatar, Stampede, Exalted rep rewards, dungeon tabards, prime glyphs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276057270452887552))<br>
<br>
Is it just me, or have the forums mostly become whine-fests lately?<br>
In my experience, posters have too much certainty. They are certain X is broken. They are certain Y is dumb. No room for dialogue. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278573498815873024))<br>
<br>
Its time for you to give your position to some experienced arena player, Who actually knows how pvp works.<br>
That would be an interesting experiment for sure. In my experience, not all good players are good designers. Different skills. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277540191995060228))<br>
Maybe you should give it a chance, there are many unbiased high leveled pvpers who want to make the game better<br>
We actually do communicate with several very highly rated PvP players. The highest rated ones are often quite reasonable. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278575120686149632))<br>
<br>
Have you ever trained your own in house devs? For someone like myself, some requirements for quals to be a dev seem...high<br>
We have Associate Designers, which is a more junior position. Some of them are former QA or CS members. We do interns on occasion. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278620785063641088))<br>
What advice would you have for a QA tester to get to a dev/designer/creative content job some day?<br>
In general: Appreciate why devs make the decisions they do, show that you can finish things, respect the player &gt; the process. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279061805421174784))<br>
<br>
But it is the manifestos and addressing each concern that you need, not teasers like these tweets.<br>
I don&apos;t have the bandwidth to address manifestos from so many players. This is but a tiny (and optional) part of my job. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275980958254112768))<br>
<br>
Just read on the forums (not ours) how I personally tuned Sunwell, that before WoW I did only fan maps, and how my PhD involved no math! (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275619007078486016))<br>
