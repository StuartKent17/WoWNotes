Yes, most likely. (The &quot;most likely&quot; is only here to make sure that you don&apos;t yell at me if something changes) <br>
<br>
Check the Patch 3.3.3 PTR Notes (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=23329393385) for a quick summary of the changes, the regular recap will be available on MMO-Champ soon. <br>

Rogue damage distribution<br>
Overall, we think rogues do too much passive damage -- autoattacks + poison. We want to shift more of that towards their specials, which will let both the finishers and the generators hit harder while keeping sustained damage about the same. It might mean less-skilled rogues do less damage by comparison, but that&apos;s not really a bad thing.

Tanking and Rage Management<br>
Early on in Karazhan you could get rage starved, and then letting off of some of the buttons for Shield Block or vice versa if you needed threat was a decision. I disagree with you that it was a major problem past that point. In the raids that followed you pretty much had enough rage to do whatever you wanted because the bosses hit so hard, unless you just got unlucky and had a string of avoidance or something.<br>
<br>
If you look at parses today of good tanks, you&apos;ll see them convert a great deal of autoattacks to Heroic Strike. Some of them can hit 100%. That implies rage is never an issue and they would have been able to hit the old Shield Block as often as they wanted... perhaps macro it even.<br>
<br>
Now if rage was a little harder to come by, then yes, you might make the decision between threat and survivability abilities. However, as a counter to that point, consider that MD and ToT combined with tauntable bosses and a lack of threat management fights like Voidreaver or Vael probably make threat rarely matter, so you lose the decision again.<br>
<br>
If we nerfed tank rage income in Cataclysm as well as nerfing the threat of MD and ToT, then I could see warriors and druids maybe having to manage their rage so they have enough for both threat and cooldowns. It&apos;s tricky though. If we went too far, then you&apos;d feel continually rage starved, which is pretty frustrating. Having to manage a resource can be fun. Never having that resource to manage would suck. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23767557794-just-get-rid-of-dodge-and-parry-altogether.html))<br>
