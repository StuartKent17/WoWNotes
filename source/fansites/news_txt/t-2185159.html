Mythic+ Feedback<br>
Thanks for copying this over! Good feedback here that I can send on up. I think the point on differences in difficulties between affixes is particularly relevant. Seems a relevant conversation the dev team would be happy to listen to is everyone&apos;s thoughts on how you deal with the various affixes (ignore them, smaller pulls, etc), and how those experiences have evolved so far in Legion.<br>
<br>
I would also be interested in how you guys rank the affixes in order of difficulty to deal with (this obviously changes as the rank increases, but lets look at say... 5 which is pretty average) in the current environment on live.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m also very aware of the differences between dungeons on Mythic+, and Ion has previously touched on the preference for Maw of Souls. I&apos;m not exactly sure what can be done at the moment about the gaps the community sees between them, but I&apos;m willing to take any feedback you guys want to share.<br>
<br>
My biggest gripe with Mythic+ are the timers. Timers are the reason I didn&apos;t like CMs, and it&apos;s the reason I really dislike Mythic+ despite loving the concept.<br>
I&apos;ve seen this point of discussion too, and it&apos;s come up numerous times in my own feedback and reporting. Just wanted to say I know this is a valid opinion that I&apos;m definitely aware of. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753407148?page=3#43))<br>

Vengeance Demon Hunter Feedback<br>
Thank you for the suggestions and discussion.<br>
<br>
In today&#x2019;s 7.2 PTR update, we&#x2019;re testing the following change:<br>
<br>
<br>
Demonic Wards now reduces all damage taken by 20% (was 10%), and increases Armor by 75% (was 120%).<br>
<br>
What this amounts to is a passive reduction of all incoming damage, combined with a lowered defenses against physical damage, leaving almost no change to incoming physical, but a substantial new mitigation against magic.<br>
<br>
Your feedback has been very helpful, so again, thank you! (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753506032?page=1#12))<br>

Protection Warrior Feedback<br>
As before, we thank you for the good feedback.<br>
<br>
The Nighthold has put a spotlight on magic mitigation more than previous raids, and we&#x2019;ve seen how that resulted in Protection Warriors (who are typically a very well-rounded tank spec) falling a bit behind other tanks as a result.<br>
<br>
Today&#x2019;s new 7.2 PTR build includes the following change:<br>
<br>
Warrior<br>
<br>
Gleaming Scales (Artifact Trait) increases Spell Reflection magical damage reduction by 20%.<br>
<br>
Gleaming Scales is a new Artifact Trait that&#x2019;s coming in 7.2, and the intention here is to provide Warriors with a way to keep up with incoming spells in encounters that are magic-heavy, such as Spell Augur Etraeus or Krosus in The Nighthold. <br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re also testing a new change to the Protection Legendary belt Thundergod&#x2019;s Vigor that triples the rate at which your Thunder Claps reduce the cooldown on Demoralizing Shout.<br>
<br>
We continue to analyze and consider everything you&#x2019;re telling us here (and elsewhere!), so keep it coming. Thank you! (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753515694?page=10#187))<br>
