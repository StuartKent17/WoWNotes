Artcraft Updates<br>
We might get a followup to the old Cosmetic Class Accessories artcraft (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4008-Artcraft-Cosmetic-Class-Accessories) at some point in the future. They were originally described as ways to customize your character, rewarded through many different gameplay activities. Keep in mind that a somewhat similar system is coming with spec specific Artifact Weapons with multiple skins.<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
No reason to exchange words, because we will most likely never meet ingame again. Thoughts?<br>
The Finders were supposed to be for when your friends weren&apos;t available, not as a way to experience an MMO solo. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/641602564044165121))<br>
But the awesome convenience of quick matchmaking means why wait for friends? League has the same problem. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/641602790096171009))<br>
<br>
I think the game design philosophy changed to: Leveling = solo, PvP/Endgame = groups.<br>
I remember in vanilla having to ask friends to help for the Plagueland cauldron quests and a few others. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/641731084707717120))<br>
But I think it&apos;s fair that a lot of people just abandoned the group quests even when they capped off a story. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/641731154467405824))<br>
