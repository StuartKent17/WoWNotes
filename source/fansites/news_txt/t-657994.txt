PTR 3.2 - Build 10128
This is a minor build and most of the changes were in the Patch Notes update posted this morning.

New Halloween Masks!
I joked about that in the original post http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=79546.0 but I didn't realize that Blizzard would actually add new masks in the next build just to create some confusion. Oh well, new Halloween masks have been added to the game in addition to the Goblins and Worgens masks from the previous build. 

This update doesn't change my view on the new races of the expansion Goblins and Worgens but I'm sure tons of people will be happy to discuss this addition. I'm not getting naked http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=79546.msg1169037#msg1169037 yet.

Players have a limited amount of time to care for these orphans before they take their leave. They will then return again for the regularly-scheduled Children’s Week next year. 

PTR Raid and Dungeon Testing July 21
Here's the current schedule for Trial of the Crusader PTR testing:

On the North American test realms:

Anub’arak - Tuesday Night, July 21, starting at 7pm EDT. Normal and Heroic.

On the European test realms:

Val'kyr – Wednesday Night, July 22, starting at 19:00 CEST. Normal and Heroic.

Some of the tests will have multiple bosses and difficulties available for testing, as noted above.

We’re going to try and have Test Patchwerks Tank and DPS versions available in the Argent Coliseum for testing. Instead of the previous tank test patchwerk that increased melee damage over time, the 3.2 tank test patchwerk will just hit VERY hard as hard as Algalon all the time to allow for more lengthy sustained tank parses. We're always interested in seeing combat logs and parses for all raid testing on the PTR, but especially test patchwerk logs. These are extremely helpful to our class team.

This schedule could change at a moment's notice due to server, bug, or patch status. I'll try to keep everyone informed as much as possible. The Trial of the Crusader and the bosses to be tested will remain also open a variable length of time. How long they stay open depends upon a host of factors including designer availability, bug status, etc. These bosses are very much a work in progress, and this is a test server.
