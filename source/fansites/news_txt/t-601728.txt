"LOL ! You suck ! They removed them 2 months ago !". That's true. But they're back ! And it will let you get 5 [item=32897]. Always nice to have 5 free flasks for running "old" instances again.

Blizzcon
Blizzard updated the Blizzcon site http://www.blizzard.com/blizzcon07/ with tons of links about pretty much everything that happened here. Yup, our changes list is here !

Meanwhile on PvPScene.com
No uber articles today, but I posted a small compilations of PvP movies http://www.pvpscene.com/index.php?topic=119.0. They're all pretty good and it will probably keep you busy one more hour this week end. 

Comics
It's been a while, but they're back ! Some of them are a bit old, and I even repost the LFG musical short but it's great !. Expect the usual updates to be back tomorrow.
