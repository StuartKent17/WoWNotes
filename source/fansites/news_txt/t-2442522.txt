World of Warcraft Classic data for the BlizzCon demo was pushed tonight! There isn't a previous build to show changes against, but feel free to ask questions that we can try and answer with client data in the comments.

Everyone with a Virtual Ticket should be able to try the demo after the opening ceremony https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8025-Bring-Home-the-BlizzCon-WoW-Classic-Demo-With-the-Virtual-Ticket.
