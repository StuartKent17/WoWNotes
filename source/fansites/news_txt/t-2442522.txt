chaud2018-10-23, 05:12 AMWorld of Warcraft Classic - Patch 1.13.0: Build 28211
World of Warcraft Classic data for the BlizzCon demo was pushed tonight! There isn't a previous build to show changes against, but feel free to ask questions that we can try and answer with client data in the comments.

Everyone with a Virtual Ticket should be able to try the demo after the opening ceremony
