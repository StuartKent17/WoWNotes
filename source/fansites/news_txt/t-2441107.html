Raid Testing Schedule - October 18th-22nd<br>
On Thursday, October 18th and Friday, October 19th we will be conducting raid tests of the Battle of Dazar&apos;alor. Once Heroic raid testing has concluded on Friday, we will open a portion of the zone for Normal raid testing over the weekend.<br>
<br>
Due to the faction specific setup of Battle of Dazar&apos;alor, Thursday&apos;s raid test will be HORDE ONLY and Friday&apos;s Heroic raid test will be ALLIANCE ONLY. Copying a character to PTR will apply a faction transfer that can be used at your discretion. Please ensure that your character is setup for the appropriate faction prior to the test.<br>

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a test environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br>
<br>
Q: How do I get into the raid zone?<br>
A: In Zuldazar, Boralus, Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade III in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. (The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.)<br>
<br>
Q: What character should I use to test the raid?<br>
A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players&apos; effective level to 120 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounter(s) being tested. <br>
<br>
Q: How long does testing last?<br>
A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we&apos;re satisfied that we&apos;ve received that information for a given boss, we&apos;ll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.<br>
<br>
What boss is Conclave of the Chosen? Is that the one flagged Loa Council in current build? or a new boss not yet in journal?<br>
Conclave of the Chosen is the proper name for the Loa Council fight.<br>
