Classes
Are any classes going to be reworked? or can we expect how skills and mechanics are now to be good for this expansion.
It depends on what you mean by "rework" but you won't see complete overhauls mid-expansion for sure. holinka

Something happened to our quest design team. Something bad.  DaveKosak 
Didn't realize quest design team role-played thru quests. Makes me wonder about all those poop quests.

Is the perk for having a lvl 3 Inn supposed to give missions with such low XP rewards? If so how do we revert back to lvl 2?
These missions don't take the place of any other missions, there's no downside to having them. Muffinus

Spec matters for 2 things: abils they can get, and their basic attack e,g,healers do lower dmg, have a heal Muffinus
