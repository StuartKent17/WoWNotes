Classes
Are any classes going to be reworked? or can we expect how skills and mechanics are now to be good for this expansion.
It depends on what you mean by "rework" but you won't see complete overhauls mid-expansion for sure. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/543838814360576001

Is the perk for having a lvl 3 Inn supposed to give missions with such low XP rewards? If so how do we revert back to lvl 2?
These missions don't take the place of any other missions, there's no downside to having them. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/543825704568123395

rerolled resto shaman and got Chain Lightning. Also disheartening to have spec not matter at all.
Spec matters for 2 things: abils they can get, and their basic attack e,g,healers do lower dmg, have a heal Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/543937811888340992
