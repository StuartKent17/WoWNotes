Patch 5.4.7 - Arena Rating Changes<br>
We recently implemented a hotfix to address a bug that allowed Personal Ratings to exceed Matchmaking Rating. As a result, some players may notice that they do not gain or lose Personal Rating in the wake of a match. As more matches are played, these ratings will normalize and converge to the correct rating, and Personal Rating will then rise or drop accordingly.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, we will continue to monitor the situation and make further adjustments if necessary.<br>

Hello, can you please answer one question? Are you done with our group Darksorrow/Genjuros/Neptulon or you are planning to add more realms?<br>
Yes we&apos;re done with that group for now.<br>
<br>
Was wondering if the Darkmoon Faire/Earthen Ring connection means we will have a 2 way and a 3 way connection of the smaller 5 RP realms (as opposed to the 5 way most were expecting).<br>
Still waiting to see how things pan out, but we&apos;re not currently planning to add more realms to the Darkmoon Faire/Earthen Ring connection.<br>
<br>
Ok, I have to ask because the wait is driving me crazy; Will Steamwheedle Cartel ever get connected?<br>
Current plans are to connect it, yes. But as I always stress, nothing is set in stone; we have to carefully analyse how things go as we proceed<br>
<br>
Thats a shame really.. I seen server be merged into fives.. that would help the 5 minor Role Play servers if they became one. Seems a lot are hoping for this to happen.<br>
Connecting all five of the EN RP realms would result in mild queues at quiet times for players on those realms, and hours of waiting to log on at busy times<br>
<br>
Would it really be the case if all except AD were connected, it&apos;d make queues? I always thought all except AD were suffering in a minor way.<br>
You&apos;re right, apologies, I edited my post to clarify I was talking about the low/medium population realms. Argent Dawn often has queues by itself so it won&apos;t be connected to any others. But yeah as I said, the others aren&apos;t as small as, say, some of the PvP ones we&apos;ve been connecting.<br>
<br>

New World of Warcraft Short Story: The Untamed Valley<br>
In Pandaria&#x2019;s Valley of the Four Winds, modest farmers have worked the land for generations. They are the true backbone of Pandaren society, feeding an empire with an honest day&#x2019;s work...scant preparation for war.<br>
<br>
Though Garrosh Hellscream has been defeated, the flames of his hatred still rage in the hearts of his followers. When the worst of these descend on Pandaria, closely followed by Alliance heroes Maraad and Lyalia, the humble Tillers find their farms transformed into battlefields.<br>
The Tillers are committed to their homes and the earth they cultivate, but will they give up their lives to protect them? Worse, will they give up their lives for nothing?<br>
<br>
