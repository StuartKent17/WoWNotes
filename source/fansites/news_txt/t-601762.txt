I don't have time to answer all my mails lately and if you think I forgot to answer something important, just mail again. This week end was a problem because I had to answer 17 mails about Diablo 3, it's not that I don't like the game, but I don't really see why everyone went berserk in the middle of august with absolutely nothing new about the game in the last month. I guess it's time for a short explanation.

Box art
A lot of site used a potential box art to announce that it would be shown at the Games Convention. This box art is a 2 years old fake and was first posted on a korean website in 2005. And was reported on a lot of sites like kotaku.com http://kotaku.com/gaming/pc/diablo-3-art-and-details-115953.php

Recruitment
A month ago, Blizzard confirmed http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14691 that they were working on a secret project and updated the job application page with tons of things. Well ... It shows that they're working on a new game, which isn't very surprising since it's what they did for the past fifteen years, but I doubt they created enough content on Diablo 3 to show anything one month later at the Game Convention.

Registered domains
www.diablo3.eu http://www.diablo3.eu is probably the most popular, because it is registered by Blizzard and shows a 403 error like the WotLK page before the release. The only problem with that is the fact that www.diablo4.eu http://www.diablo4.eu, www.starcraft3.eu http://www.starcraft3.eu, www.worldofwarcraft2.eu http://www.worldofwarcraft2.eu, and www.warcraft4.eu http://www.warcraft4.eu are also registered by Blizzard and shows a 403 error. 

Hints from various artists
Richard A. Knaak hinted http://www.blizzplanet.com/content/601/ that he "wasn't writing for a dead game" when asked if his book could have an impact on Diablo 3 storyline.
There is a 2007 artwork of Diablo on Sonsofthestorms.com http://www.sonsofthestorm.com/viewer_raneman.php?cat=diablo&art=4 Samwise Didier's site. If you check the previous artworks, you'll see covers from the books written by Knaak, we can assume it was made later. And it was actually used on the Blizzcon brochure

Conclusion
Diablo 3 is under development, of course. Why the hell wouldn't they use something as popular and great as Diablo to create new games ? But I don't see any reason to announce anything about an online game one month after WotLK, they'll probably just do it during one of the next Blizzcon. and by the way, keep in mind that the Games Convention will have a WotLK trailer 

No more mails about it, please, however you're free to mail me to tell me that I'm nice.
