It appears that Хируко of Razuvious-EU http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/razuvious/%D0%A5%D0%B8%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%BE/advanced has managed to complete all of the regular character achievements, along with 205 of the ~340 Feats of Strength. 

According to him http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1501393-All-WoW-achievements-100-complete?p=26569239#post26569239, Realm First of every class on the same day http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/april/achievements01.jpg by transferring to a low population PvP realm and multiboxing while his guild killed anyone trying to level before him.

One thing that confuses me is all the +20% damage increases. Surely damage increases are meaningless due to balancing?
Some of them are transformative. Some are just something to make dinging 93 a bit cooler. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/451902977360404480

So why are the Draenor perks random order? It's unbalanced and lacking customization, what's the pro?
It's a reward for leveling, not character customization. With choice, people can become paralyzed about what's 'right'. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451946173016702976

Will there be new glyphs?
Yes. Currently about 80, give or take. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451906451049418752

For Unholy Death Knights You are knocking down the Unholy Might cause of better secondaries any chance at a deeper explanation?
That's heavily tied to our damage balancing pass, which hasn't started yet. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451901219066245120

Is the goal with AMS soaking to only allow a maximum of 100 RP to be possible from a fully absorbed shell? Big nerf to soaking.
Yes, intentionally. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451893185552216064
Is the rationale because you'd like to reduce GCD locking by DKs, or because you don't like balancing us around AMS soaking?
Both. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451902397816635394

If seraphim depletes all the runic power we have, how will we build up enough to get a Verdict or SoR off before it expires?

They bring Haste, Stats, and Physical Damage Vulnerability. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451904886158794752

Why is starfall hitting more targets? stars are capped at 20? why ever use insect swarm? does it a insane amount of dmg?
Stars are capped at 30 with that. Insect Swarm accelerates your rotation, and does a lot of damage. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451945881617453058

Insect Swarm could be made spellstorm damage as well.
Since it's only cast outside of Eclipse, it doesn't actually matter to gameplay, just matters for kit. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451962263927128065

Does the Balance version of DoC give you a Starsurge from hitting Eclipse or casting the instant Healing Touch?
Casting the instant HT. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451962672460738560

So Dream of Cenarius talent is just +20% Healing Touch? Seems pretty lackluster honestly
It's not intended to be a DPS gain anymore. It's for better off-role ability. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451969473008766976

Hunter's Distracting Shot removed, possible to see it as a minor glyph? I'd be very sad to see the clutch plays go ;_;
Raised the range of Growl so that you can use it in that way, for the majority of cases. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451907359355322368

Losing Widow Venom while other classes are keeping their MS debuffs- is the effect going to be baked into another ability?
Pets including non-exotics can apply it. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451962949825859584

why no Execute mechanic for Surv hunters, not Kill shot, but smthg else? 1 extra charge of "LnL" from BA when target below 30%?
Not every spec needs to have an execute. In fact it's a pro that you have an option that doesn't. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451992652452352001

.Is the idea with the redesigned Frost Bomb that we cast it only when we have FOF charges?
Yes. May not be mentioned in the patch notes but it only triggers from FoF'd Ice Lances. Tried all crits early in testing, was OP Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451893981643689985
So Basically, pattern is now FOF proc -> Frost Bomb if you have the talent -> Ice Lance -> Ice Lance
And it lasts 12sec, so keep using FoF procs while it's up, yeah. For min/maxing, you can leave FBomb down, and pool FoFs. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451900116966719488

If Incanter's Flow is on average 15% increased damage, why would I want to spec into Rune of Power?
Valid point; just haven't tune a precise tuning pass yet. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451903984849014785

Could Nether Tempest have a chance to generate arcane charges? Increased cast time on blast looks like a pain for PvP.
See Perks. It becomes faster with charges. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451940589500502016
NT multi dotting was way to proc missiles, hence charges in PvP, now NT 1 target only = less procs, less charges.
Only the most recent NT ever proc'd missiles. Your multidotting wasn't giving you any additional AM procs. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451952599747407872

Brain Freeze has to make FFB instant cast or the spec will be ruined IMO.
Frost's rotation was overwhelmingly instants, which caused numerous problems. Turning one of them into a cast time may feel... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451993619570782208
...like a nerf, but actually is better in the end. Encounters demand less movement, casting can be a thing in PvP, Haste valued. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451993859912761344

So will eminence still be tied to a crappy range and statue?
Yes, but that's good for you, you can use it to your advantage. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451901904193216512

Why Clash? Dealing with casters will suck so much without it. It's one of the more fun BrM tanking abilities.
We cut Clash because it was redundant with their other stuns and Roll. We'd rather you Roll more see Draenor Perks. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451993200077438976

Last Q/comment, and least. RE: Mistweaver: why no chi gen from SoM and CJL now?Don't understand the intent
Several reasons. Biggest is to fix mana for Mistweavers. Now, more mana = more chi gen, by a significant degree = more chi ... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451994446771417090
...spenders. That means spirit increases all parts of your healing, which is a good thing. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451994672982806528

Will holy pally still be just absorb healing like currently ? and disc priest aegis. with the nerfs hope this is nerfed
No, we're aiming to significantly tone down how much of Healadin throughput is absorption. We'll balance Disc and Healadin power. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451904618591576065

Retribution's passive perks are a bit passive, mostly just damage increases. Any chance we can see more interesting effects...
We tried to strike a good balance of interesting vs simple, but I agree, Ret is more on the simple side. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451967258433040384

....ease into those rotational changes that way. In some cases, such as Ret, we were happy with their rotation as is. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451967560058023936

Will seal of insight still provide 10% spell haste?
No; Seal of Insight no longer provides any haste, but a Holy passive don't recall which one offhand does instead. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451970570637160449
Reason being that we are only doing full Haste, not Melee Haste or Spell Haste anymore, but only want Holy to benefit from it Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451970827664117760
And will haste work the same for all classes now or still no haste for melee dots?
Still no haste for melee DoTs because they're not spells, you get increased resources from haste instead. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451975071901315072
Will that include the haste buff now that its nerfed to 5%?
Yes. The 10% Attack Speed raid buff has been replaced with 5% Haste. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451975678338936832

Hey. Hey you. Hey. I don't see several key major rogue glyphs in the auto-learn list.
Auto-learn glyphs were chosen based on usefulness while leveling. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451944402848448512

Read as back front and 2 sides.so no back stabbing from the front. which makes a certain sort of sense
Backstab is usable from the left, right, and back. Not the front. So 270degree usability radius. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451945137912827904
On the topic of Rogues: woo for making Assa viable with other weapons than daggers! Awesome!

Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451901578522263553

No Healing Tide Totem and no Unleashed Lightning. Can we expect elemental shamans single target to be bought significantly up?
Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451902594328166400

Is the ULE-Healing Rain buff being built into the baseline spell, or is HR just effectively getting nerfed 30% from that change?
Do you not think Healing Rain needs a nerf, compared to live? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451903853735079936

Also Unleash Weapon was listed in mobility damage skills. But Unleash Fire/Frost/Wind no longer deal damage so uh... wat?
They don't *directly* do damage, but they are a significant net damage gain. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451908191375220736

Any chance elemental could retain moving lightning bolt? Would be good to know now if I need to reroll for WoD Progression.
You don't need to reroll. Elemental will be balanced around that change. Yes, we know it's a huge change. Sky isn't falling. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451992422877102081

Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/april/ssdgraph.gif are stable, with all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. 

The Haswell CPUs http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1 run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&tag=mmochamp-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A. 

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx and Nvidia http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us drivers up to date.
