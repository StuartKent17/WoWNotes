Warlords of Draenor - Build 18156 Minimap
The new build made some significant changes to the Draenor's minimap. You can find the previous version of the map here 


  


Mists of Pandaria - All Character Achievements Complete
It appears that Хируко of Razuvious-EU  has managed to complete all of the regular character achievements, along with 205 of the ~340 Feats of Strength. 

According to him , Realm First of every class on the same day  by transferring to a low population PvP realm and multiboxing while his guild killed anyone trying to level before him.

One thing that confuses me is all the +20% damage increases. Surely damage increases are meaningless due to balancing?
Some of them are transformative. Some are just something to make dinging 93 a bit cooler. WatcherDev 

So why are the Draenor perks random order? It's unbalanced and lacking customization, what's the pro?
It's a reward for leveling, not character customization. With choice, people can become paralyzed about what's 'right'. Celestalon 

Will there be new glyphs?
Yes. Currently about 80, give or take. Celestalon 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
For Unholy Death Knights You are knocking down the Unholy Might cause of better secondaries any chance at a deeper explanation?
That's heavily tied to our damage balancing pass, which hasn't started yet. Celestalon 

Is the goal with AMS soaking to only allow a maximum of 100 RP to be possible from a fully absorbed shell? Big nerf to soaking.
Yes, intentionally. Celestalon 
Is the rationale because you'd like to reduce GCD locking by DKs, or because you don't like balancing us around AMS soaking?
Both. Celestalon 

If seraphim depletes all the runic power we have, how will we build up enough to get a Verdict or SoR off before it expires?
It's long enough that you'll be able to. Don't forget Haste! Celestalon 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Why aren't balance druids bringing CoE? looks like they get fewest buffs/debuffs w/ motw and spell haste
They bring Haste, Stats, and Physical Damage Vulnerability. Celestalon 

Why is starfall hitting more targets? stars are capped at 20? why ever use insect swarm? does it a insane amount of dmg?
Stars are capped at 30 with that. Insect Swarm accelerates your rotation, and does a lot of damage. Celestalon 

Insect Swarm could be made spellstorm damage as well.
Since it's only cast outside of Eclipse, it doesn't actually matter to gameplay, just matters for kit. Celestalon 

Does the Balance version of DoC give you a Starsurge from hitting Eclipse or casting the instant Healing Touch?
Casting the instant HT. Celestalon 

So Dream of Cenarius talent is just +20% Healing Touch? Seems pretty lackluster honestly
It's not intended to be a DPS gain anymore. It's for better off-role ability. Celestalon 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Hunter's Distracting Shot removed, possible to see it as a minor glyph? I'd be very sad to see the clutch plays go ;_;
Raised the range of Growl so that you can use it in that way, for the majority of cases. Celestalon 

Losing Widow Venom while other classes are keeping their MS debuffs- is the effect going to be baked into another ability?
Pets including non-exotics can apply it. Celestalon 

why no Execute mechanic for Surv hunters, not Kill shot, but smthg else? 1 extra charge of "LnL" from BA when target below 30%?
Not every spec needs to have an execute. In fact it's a pro that you have an option that doesn't. Celestalon 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
.Is the idea with the redesigned Frost Bomb that we cast it only when we have FOF charges?
Yes. May not be mentioned in the patch notes but it only triggers from FoF'd Ice Lances. Tried all crits early in testing, was OP Celestalon 
So Basically, pattern is now FOF proc -> Frost Bomb if you have the talent -> Ice Lance -> Ice Lance
And it lasts 12sec, so keep using FoF procs while it's up, yeah. For min/maxing, you can leave FBomb down, and pool FoFs. Celestalon 

If Incanter's Flow is on average 15% increased damage, why would I want to spec into Rune of Power?
Valid point; just haven't tune a precise tuning pass yet. Celestalon 

Could Nether Tempest have a chance to generate arcane charges? Increased cast time on blast looks like a pain for PvP.
See Perks. It becomes faster with charges. Celestalon 
NT multi dotting was way to proc missiles, hence charges in PvP, now NT 1 target only = less procs, less charges.
Only the most recent NT ever proc'd missiles. Your multidotting wasn't giving you any additional AM procs. Celestalon 

Brain Freeze has to make FFB instant cast or the spec will be ruined IMO.
Frost's rotation was overwhelmingly instants, which caused numerous problems. Turning one of them into a cast time may feel... Celestalon 
...like a nerf, but actually is better in the end. Encounters demand less movement, casting can be a thing in PvP, Haste valued. Celestalon 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
So will eminence still be tied to a crappy range and statue?
Yes, but that's good for you, you can use it to your advantage. Celestalon 

Why Clash? Dealing with casters will suck so much without it. It's one of the more fun BrM tanking abilities.
We cut Clash because it was redundant with their other stuns and Roll. We'd rather you Roll more see Draenor Perks. Celestalon 

Last Q/comment, and least. RE: Mistweaver: why no chi gen from SoM and CJL now?Don't understand the intent
Several reasons. Biggest is to fix mana for Mistweavers. Now, more mana = more chi gen, by a significant degree = more chi ... Celestalon 
...spenders. That means spirit increases all parts of your healing, which is a good thing. Celestalon 
You can get some baseline amount of Chi from cheap sources ReM, EH, still, so you won't be chi-starved. Celestalon 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Will holy pally still be just absorb healing like currently ? and disc priest aegis. with the nerfs hope this is nerfed
No, we're aiming to significantly tone down how much of Healadin throughput is absorption. We'll balance Disc and Healadin power. Celestalon 

Retribution's passive perks are a bit passive, mostly just damage increases. Any chance we can see more interesting effects...
We tried to strike a good balance of interesting vs simple, but I agree, Ret is more on the simple side. Celestalon 
.Commonly, we used the Draenor Perks as a place to make tweaks to rotations that we wanted to make anyway. Better to... Celestalon 
....ease into those rotational changes that way. In some cases, such as Ret, we were happy with their rotation as is. Celestalon 

Will seal of insight still provide 10% spell haste?
No; Seal of Insight no longer provides any haste, but a Holy passive don't recall which one offhand does instead. Celestalon 
Reason being that we are only doing full Haste, not Melee Haste or Spell Haste anymore, but only want Holy to benefit from it Celestalon 
And will haste work the same for all classes now or still no haste for melee dots?
Still no haste for melee DoTs because they're not spells, you get increased resources from haste instead. Celestalon 
Will that include the haste buff now that its nerfed to 5%?
Yes. The 10% Attack Speed raid buff has been replaced with 5% Haste. Celestalon 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Combat FoK bonus seems underwhelming compared to Sub/Mut. Chance of changing it?
They have Blade Flurry on top of that. Celestalon 

interested in the thoughts behind fist/swords being able to be used for dispatch and daggers for sinister strikes? No compliants
Intended to be 'okay' to use in case you are over a tier behind on the optimal weapons, but not optimal. Celestalon 

Hey. Hey you. Hey. I don't see several key major rogue glyphs in the auto-learn list.
Auto-learn glyphs were chosen based on usefulness while leveling. Celestalon 

Read as back front and 2 sides.so no back stabbing from the front. which makes a certain sort of sense
Backstab is usable from the left, right, and back. Not the front. So 270degree usability radius. Celestalon 
On the topic of Rogues: woo for making Assa viable with other weapons than daggers! Awesome!
Kind of. It's *possible*, but not *optimal* to play Assassination with non-daggers. Celestalon 

With Mind-Numbing and Paralytic gone, can we rogues have another poison? So there's, y'know, a choice?
We're considering the limited poison situation. Instant Poison does work for Venom Zest at least, BTW. Celestalon 
So again why is it a conditional worse version of a level 45 Monk talent as our ultimate mega one?
Because different classes are different. They're weaker than you are without it. We balance the... Celestalon 
...power of characters *with* talents. Talents don't need to be balanced cross-class. Celestalon 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
No mention of Earth Shield in the patch notes. Surely you are scrapping that, it's such a pain with multiple Shamans!
Multiple Earth Shields can stack, not a pain. Celestalon 
So you are changing Earth Shield so 2 can be on the same target at a time finally?
Yes. Celestalon 

No Healing Tide Totem and no Unleashed Lightning. Can we expect elemental shamans single target to be bought significantly up?
Yes. Celestalon 

Is the ULE-Healing Rain buff being built into the baseline spell, or is HR just effectively getting nerfed 30% from that change?
Do you not think Healing Rain needs a nerf, compared to live? Celestalon 

Also Unleash Weapon was listed in mobility damage skills. But Unleash Fire/Frost/Wind no longer deal damage so uh... wat?
They don't *directly* do damage, but they are a significant net damage gain. Celestalon 

Any chance elemental could retain moving lightning bolt? Would be good to know now if I need to reroll for WoD Progression.
You don't need to reroll. Elemental will be balanced around that change. Yes, we know it's a huge change. Sky isn't falling. Celestalon 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Have there been any changes to the planned non-interaction between GoSacrifice and Demonic Servitude?
Planning to indeed make it a bad idea to Sacrifice your Big Demon. However, we're working on new abilities for the Doomguard/Infer. Celestalon 

Just read that Drain Soul is being removed from warlocks, but no mention of how Soul Shards will be replenished. Clarify?
Nightfall. And there's a Draenor Perk that increases Nightfall rate Celestalon 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
The way that Gladiator Stance and the talent is worded, it seems like prot warriors who take it will still be able to tank
We did that so that tanks still have 3 talent choices when tanking. If you goto Gladiator Stance, you can no longer tank. Celestalon 
If you take the Gladiator Stance talent, you can still tank, with 5% extra DR, but none of the offensive benefits. Celestalon 
Correction: When you take the Gladiator's RESOLVE talent, you get 5% DR in Def Stance, for tanking, and the OPTION to... Celestalon 
...switch to the Gladiator STANCE to become a DPS, and NOT a Tank. Celestalon 
Doesn't that lead to tanks going Gladiator Stance when not their turn to get hit, swap back in when their turn?
Can't swap into or out of Gladiator Stance in combat. Celestalon 

With warrior shouts no longer generating rage, it appears the only way to start a fight with rage is Charge. Is that accurate? @Celestalon
Yes. Charge in to start with Rage. Celestalon 

Will the Warrior Haste bonus modifier remain, and how will Headlong Rush scale haste with CD/GCD? 50% Haste = 50% reduction?
No, the +50% haste from gear buff on warriors will be removed. Scales just like everyone else. 25% Haste = 1/1.25 = 80% GCDs. Celestalon 

is gladiator locked out of unwavering sentinel and bastion of defense. also is block being removed or reduced in glad?
Unwavering Sentinel is Defensive Stance only. If you still find that you're able to tank in Gladiator stance, we'll adjust. Celestalon 


Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud 
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud  will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices  are stable, with all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. 

The Haswell CPUs  run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.
