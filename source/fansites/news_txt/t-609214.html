While we wait for the announcement let&apos;s bring the teaser to the top of the homepage. <br>
<br>
Official site teaser/splash screen - Day 5<br>
This is the last day before the WWI, the eyes in the middle of the screen really start to look like the Lich King&apos;s ... However the creature artwork has been fully uploaded (we&apos;re not sure if it&apos;s an error or not) and we now have the full picture (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/creatureartwork.jpg) available. <br>

<br>
The splash screen<br>
This is the most obvious part of the teaser, a huge picture of a block of ice slowly cracking to reveal what seems to be a face. Each day a rune was added to the ice.<br>
Day 1 - The first rune looks a lot like the one found on the Lich King swords in many official artworks. <br>
Day 2 - The 2nd rune is the Hel Rune from Diablo 2<br>
Day 3 - The 3rd rune is the Protoss Symbol found on the Starcraft 2 official site (http://www.starcraft2.com/features/)<br>
Day 4 - The 4th rune hasn&apos;t been identified yet, and what looks like the eyes of the lich king appeared in the center of the ice crack. <br>
Day 5 - A new rune has been added and looks like a viking compass. The eyes started to glow, the creature artwork from the CSS files is now complete. The runes also started to glow, you can compare these screenshots : Screenshot #1 (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/splashfinal.jpg) / Screenshot #2 (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/splashfinal2.jpg)<br>
