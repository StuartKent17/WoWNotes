Timewalking
is Ironbound Wraithcharger a WoD exclusive? or will it be obtainable a long while from now? should i be rushing to get asap?
The Timewalking rewards aren’t tied to this expansion – no need to rush! WarcraftDevs 

Game Design
could either of you clarify the difference between creative and technical design from your perspectives?
Good question. I can't fit a good answer in a twitter post, so I wrote a quick blog on it:  craig_amai 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
but why did so many feel the need to server transfer? Cause playerbase dropped with cata overtuning. Servers healthy in wotlk
Not my recollection. In NA, PvP players move to Tich and raiders to Mal'ganis. That's where the action was. OccupyGStreet 
In my memory, my server still had an identity i.e. I knew individual players in BC but not beyond. YMMV. OccupyGStreet 

Were you consulted on things that had a dollar or pound/euro value behind them like server transfers, you know what I mean.
Yes. OccupyGStreet 


Road to BlizzCon – Watch the Americas Regionals Live September 12–13
Eight teams have qualified for the 2015 World of Warcraft Arena Americas Regionals tournament—one from Latin America, one from Australia and New Zealand, and six from North America. On September 12 and 13, three of those teams will advance to the WoW Arena World Championship at BlizzCon 2015 . . . and five will be heading back home.

You’ll be able to watch the carnage unfold live on Twitch.tv/Warcraft on September 12 and 13 at 12 p.m. PT—but in the meantime, let’s meet the contenders who’ve risen through the ranks over the past few months.

The Teams

Method
Under their original moniker "Is Butter a Carb," this was the first North American team to qualify, beating out Luminosity in the Grand Finals of the first North American Online Qualifier Cup back in July. Since then, the group has reunited under the Method banner to prove that their run in Cup 1 was no coincidence and that they deserve a spot in the World Championships at BlizzCon.

Team Captain: Chanimal – Affliction/Demonology Warlock
Gorecki – Restoration Shaman, Balance Druid, Beast Mastery Hunter, Affliction Warlock
Rositajonez – Frost Mage
Psytrix – Holy Paladin


Juveniles
This team claimed victory under the name "Rise of le Sock" in the second North American Online Qualifier Cup, and eliminated many well-known players to get here. As the only team in the Regionals with only three players on their roster—and only one playable composition—they must prove that numbers don’t make might if they want to advance to BlizzCon.

Team Captain: Roastyz – Subtlety Rogue
Wealthysockx – Frost Mage
Kubzy – Restoration Druid


Tempo Storm
The name Tempo Storm has inspired fear in opponents in many eSports events, and the World of Warcraft Arena is no different. Tempo Storm has proven time and again that they’re a force to be reckoned with in online tournaments, but can they hold up under pressure at the Americas Regionals?

Team Captain: Elite – Holy Paladin
Pikaboo – Subtlety Rogue, Arms Warrior
Jahmilli – Frost Mage, Subtlety/Combat Rogue, Shadow Priest, Enhancement Shaman
Starship – Restoration Druid, Survival/Beast Mastery Hunter


Luminosity
Luminosity had a very competitive showing in NA Online Qualifier Cups 1 and 2, but it wasn’t until Cup 3 that they secured their position at Regionals. Now they’re out to prove that those defeats were merely a setback and that they’re destined for the Arena stage at BlizzCon.

Team Captain: Vanguards – Enhancement Shaman, Retribution Paladin, Mistweaver Monk
Maldiva – Affliction Warlock
Smexxin – Arms/Fury Warrior
Dannycarry – Restoration Druid, Mistweaver Monk


Dream Deferred
In the third NA Online Qualifier Cup, this team previously named "World of Warcats" showed just how much of a threat they can be right out of the gates, scoring two wins in under 60 seconds. Are the other teams prepared for Dream Deferred’s opening onslaught?

Team Captain: Blackjeff – Frost/Unholy Death Knight
Beatsbydrake – Affliction/Demonology Warlock
Sychzy – Feral Druid
Vincentwong – Holy Paladin


FolloweSports.com
Formerly known as "Carlos’ Bandidos", this team fought to the bitter end to secure their spot, beating out Dream Team 3–2 in the third-place match at NA Online Cup 3. They’re going to need to keep that same determination and tenacity to fight through the other teams in the Americas Regionals.

Team Captain: Absterge – Restoration Shaman
Jellybeans – Beast Mastery Hunter
Vosil – Affliction/Demonology Warlock
Walterbare – Feral Druid


Hype
Hype previously "Bang Bang AU" emerged victorious as the winners of the Australia & New Zealand qualifying tournament in July. Although these players are relatively unknown, they had an extremely solid showing in the qualifiers. How will they stack up against the best teams from the Americas?

Team Captain: Nyz – Unholy Death Knight
Oyx – Arms Warrior
Ymcmshred – Restoration Druid
Creepinbrah – Restoration Druid


Santos Dexterity
Santos Dexterity, originally known as "This is Brasil", dominated the Copa America, winning four out of five play days and not dropping a single game in the finals stage. Consistency was the name of their game, as they won every single game with their preferred composition of Enhancement Shaman, Affliction Warlock, and Restoration Druid.

Team Captain: Rynd – Restoration Druid, Restoration Shaman, Holy Paladin
Shapis – Affliction Warlock
Murmindz – Enhancement Shaman, Shadow Priest
Xadin – Arms Warrior


The Prizes
The teams at the Americas Regionals will be competing for their share of a massive $100,000 prize pool—the largest of any regional event in World of Warcraft history. Every team will receive a portion of that money, but the amount increases dramatically the further the teams advance through the tournament.

1st place team: $50,000
2nd place team: $20,000
3rd place team: $10,000
4th place team: $8,000
5th–6th place teams: $4,000
7th–8th place teams: $2,000


Of course, that’s not the only prize at stake. The top three teams will also advance to the WoW Arena World Championship at BlizzCon 2015, where they’ll join five more teams from around the world to compete for $250,000 in prize money.

The Event
The World of Warcraft Arena Americas Regionals will be broadcast live on Twitch.tv/Warcraft starting at 12 p.m. PT on Saturday, September 12 and Sunday, September 13. You won’t want to miss a second of the action.

Of course, an epic event needs an epic crew, and we’re pulling out all the stops with a collection of some of the best shoutcasters and analysts in the World of Warcraft Arena scene:

Sid ’Supatease’ Compston
Elliott ‘Venruki’ Venczel
Jared ‘vhell’ Coulston
Josh ‘Lore’ Allen

These guys will be talking spectators through every match, ensuring that you don’t miss any of the high-level strategic play we know we can expect from these amazing teams. We’ll see you there!
