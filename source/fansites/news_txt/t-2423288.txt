BlizzCon Season Kicks Off with “Best of BlizzCon” Videos, Programming Reveals, and a Bonus Blizzard Infographic
Every BlizzCon is a piece of Blizzard Entertainment history. It’s a unique opportunity for us at Blizzard to geek out about our shared passion for games with our community and reveal what we’ve been working on with everyone. It’s also where our community comes to experience and help create unforgettable moments that last a lifetime.

This year, we’re kicking off BlizzCon season with a few firsts. We’ve created the “Blizzard Community Spotlight 2018” infographic, highlighting stats and fun facts about our players and what they do in and outside of our games, and with a few eye-popping facts about what goes into making BlizzCon a spectacle. We’ve also created a video campaign that lets all of you relive and vote on your favorite moments from BlizzCons past.

Then of course there’s this upcoming BlizzCon, which everyone will be able to follow via Virtual Ticket. Today, we’re giving the first glimpse of what’s to come when BlizzCon and Virtual Ticket 2018 programming kicks off in three weeks with the “BlizzCon All-Access Kick-Off Show.” Jump to the “Save the Dates” section at the bottom if you can’t wait to see what’s coming up.

Best of BlizzCons Past
It’s only fitting to start the festivities for our 12th BlizzCon, taking place this November 2–3, by giving you a chance to relive the most unforgettable moments from the show and vote on your all-time “Best of BlizzCon.”

Whether you were there in person, watched it online, or heard about it, every BlizzCon has its share of surprises and delights. These have been from announcements and surprises during our opening ceremony, from cameos from our favorite personalities, from epic esports moments. We’re trying to unearth the most memorable moments from all these categories, and then see what you decide are the best of all time.

We’ll be releasing new “Best of BlizzCon” videos from four different categories every two weeks, and you can vote on your favorite from each. Closer to the show, we’ll reveal the “Best of BlizzCon Moments of All Time.” The campaign starts today with “Top BlizzCon Surprises,” and voting is live now!
