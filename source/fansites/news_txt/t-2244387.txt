Frost

Glacial Spike’s stored Icicle damage component no longer benefits from %-damage buffs on the caster.
Glacial Spike damage increased by 50%.

Developers’ notes: This prevents the Icicles from doubling %-damage buffs since the stored Icicle damage already benefits from such buffs. The base damage of Glacial Spike is being increased so that the total damage is similar to what it was in typical situations.
