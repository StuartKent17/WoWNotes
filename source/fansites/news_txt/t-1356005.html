Battle.Net Launcher Update<br>
It looks like testing is going well, as the Battle.Net launcher is now being advertised on the site (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/october/newBnetLauncherAd2.jpg), and a new page (http://us.battle.net/en/app/) has been added on Battle.Net with information about it. Unfortunately, chat is still not enabled in the client yet.<br>

Elite PvP Gear<br>
.Is it permanently or temporary because of the conquest cap bug at the start of this season. <br>
The elite set only providing armor is permanent, although there is nothing to say this won&apos;t change in future seasons. The Elite Grievous gear is only giving armor because it&apos;s designed as a transmog set, rather than gear you would need to spend gold to enchant and gem again. It&apos;s also not intended to provide better stats than the normal set, it&apos;s meant to make your gear different and more identifiable to signify the prestige of your accomplishment. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/273372-elite-gear/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8324982818?page=1#5))<br>

Burden of Eternity Rarity<br>
We like the extra rarity that comes from requiring multiple Burdens to get perfectly-itemized 535 gear. The gear is very good, so we don&apos;t want it to be too easy to get a hold of the best possible pieces. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/273366-timeless-isle-gear-and-use-of-burdens/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10137434201?page=1#20))<br>

Cross-Realm Looking For Group<br>
Why can&apos;t you guys at blizzard just implement a dedicated LFG crossrealm browsing/listing system?<br>
That is definitely a good idea but like always, it&#x2019;s mostly a matter of time and resources vs current needs.<br>
<br>
Many of the ideas from some of the top addons have in the past been integrated into the default game UI. <br>
I agree that this would be a great tool to have but I also believe that this is nothing new to the devs. I&#x2019;m pretty sure they are quite aware about the current needs for such a tool, especially now that we have such flexibility with all the cross-realm functionalities.<br>
<br>
The raid browser, for example, was an early attempt at tackling this. It worked out somewhat ok initially but subsequent iterations weren&#x2019;t as successful. I suspect the reasons for this were the introduction of LFR and not having a dedicated button on the main interface (a lot of players still don&#x2019;t know about its existence). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/273327-timeless-isle-ruined-pandaria/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8325342684?page=2#29))<br>
<br>
Legendary Quest Items<br>
It&apos;s only 1 attempt per boss per week across all difficulties. <br>
<br>
If you already completed Siege of Orgrimmar wings 1 and 2 for Secrets of the Empire (http://www.wowdb.com/items/94593-secrets-of-the-empire) they won&apos;t drop a Titan Runestone (http://www.wowdb.com/items/94594-titan-runestone). If you haven&apos;t completed Throne of Thunder wings 3 and 4 though, you can run that with Lei Shen being a 100% guaranteed drop..<br>
<br>
As a side note, only the first 8 bosses in SoO have a chance (Sha of Pride is 100% guaranteed just like Lei Shen) to drop items for Wrathion&apos;s legendary quest line.

Flex Raiding<br>
How is personal loot and loot being distributed between 10/25 players even close to being the same thing?<br>
The point is that neither system is intended to have no waste, which is what seemingly was being requested. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383010414730043392))<br>
<br>
Now I&apos;m confused. I thought flex was targeted at a different demography from LFR, normal and heroic? Running both = burnout.<br>
My point was it gives you something to graduate to. Normal guilds graduating to heroic has been a thing since we launched heroic. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382246930081787904))<br>

Reputation / Questing<br>
Really think questing/endgame/rep need to go backward a bit. Wrath is by far the fav WoW Expac in all polls. Maybe look why?<br>
We find it&apos;s hard to extricate the story and world from the gameplay even in people&apos;s minds. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382245059485122560))<br>
For example, I love Northrend as a place and all of the various story arcs. I&apos;ve always been a nerubian fan. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382245161608028160))<br>
But would the LK rep grind or dungeon grind transposed to Pandaria turn it into another Wrath of the LK? Not convinced of that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382245594359533568))<br>

Heroic Garrosh 25 (Asia) Defeated<br>
Blood Legion (http://www.wowprogress.com/encounter/garrosh-hellscream-heroic-25man) wasn&apos;t the only guild to kill Heroic Garrosh 25 recently. Stars is still around in Asia and killing bosses, this time with a 576 item level group. You can see the final moments of the kill below. <br>
