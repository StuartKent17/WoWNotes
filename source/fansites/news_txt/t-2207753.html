Patch 7.2.5 - Pirate&apos;s Day<br>
It seems that Pirate&apos;s Day is getting some updates in Patch 7.2.5! Many new lines of dialogue were added in the recent PTR builds. <br>
Bloodsail Admiral<br>
<br>
Make way for the Admiral!<br>
Welcome back, Admiral $p. We&apos;ve been expectin&apos; ya.<br>
Happy Pirates&apos; Day, Admiral $p! You&apos;ve earned the right to raise the Black.<br>
Already done sackin&apos; Booty Bay, Admiral? Ha, those mollusks don&apos;t stand a chance with you at the helm!<br>
Three cheers for Admiral $p, a true Bloodsail! One of us!<br>
Admiral $p! You&apos;re a welcome sight from the wannabe pirates that always come crawlin&apos; around this day.<br>

Hail to the conqueror of Booty Bay, the scourge of Stranglethorn, Bloodsail Admiral $p!<br>
It&apos;s good to finally meet the famous $p! Me crew tell tales of your legendary sackings of Booty Bay. Everyone likes to pretend to be a Bloodsail today, but you&apos;re the real deal. Fly the Black with pride, matey.<br>

Song<br>
This song might be to the tune of Blow the Man Down (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufWdpNSs3DM). If you are feeling inspired, feel free to sing it and submit the recording (http://www.mmo-champion.com/sendmessage.php). <br>
<br>
<br>
As I was a-walking down Booty Bay&apos;s planks...<br>
A pretty young lass I chanced to meet...<br>
She was round in the counter and bluff in the bow...<br>
So I took in all sail and cried, &quot;Way enough now!&quot;<br>
I hailed her in dwarvish, she answered me clear...<br>
&quot;I&apos;m from Ironforge, bound to Bronzebeard!&quot;<br>
To me way, aye, blow the man down!<br>
Give me some time to blow the man down!<br>
Look ahead, look astern, look the weather and the lee...<br>
I see a wreck to windward and a lofty ship to lee...<br>
&quot;Oh, are you a pirate or a royal fleet?&quot; cried he...<br>
We be pirates! Bloodsail!<br>
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we!<br>
A-sailing down the coasts to Booty!<br>
Give us your treasure and your ale!<br>
We&apos;ll rant and we&apos;ll roar, like true Bloodsail pirates!<br>
We&apos;ll rant and we&apos;ll rave, across the salt seas!<br>
&apos;Til we strike soundings in the Cape o&apos; Stranglethorn!<br>
From Arathi to Booty Bay is too far indeed!<br>
So it&apos;s cheer up, my lads. Let your hearts never sink!<br>
While the bonny ship, Crimson Whirl, goes a-fishing for the drink.<br>
Here&apos;s a health to the Red Whale...<br>
Here&apos;s a health to the Battler of Westfall...<br>
We wear the shirts o&apos; the white...<br>
When we return to Stranglethorn, we&apos;ll have sweethearts &apos;til dead!<br>
Likewise, the Pippy Swan!<br>
And the Ruby, ship of fame!<br>
And the pants o&apos; the red!<br>
The keg is empty in the morn...<br>
And it&apos;s mighty drafty around Stranglethorn...<br>
Oh, ya pirates and scoundrels...<br>
It&apos;s &apos;round the Cape we&apos;ve got to go...<br>
Oh, it&apos;s one more pull and that will do...<br>
For we&apos;re the mateys to kick her through!<br>
Go down, ya Bloodsail pirates, go down!<br>
Chasing ships wherever we go!<br>
He says heave, we say ho!<br>
<br>
<br>
Rear Admiral Giggleplanks<br>
<br>
I will reach Booty Bay just after nightfall. Then, under the cover of darkness, I will make them feel the full wrath of the Bloodsail!<br>
Rear Admiral Giggleplanks kicks frantically, but his feet don&apos;t reach the water.<br>
Curse this briny stallion to the depths! It won&apos;t obey my orders. Forward, beast, or I&apos;ll keelhaul you!<br>
All of Booty Bay fears my arrival! It has been foretold in the ancient legends!<br>
Beware the unbridled wrath of Rear Admiral Giggleplanks! Not even the unusually large rats of Booty Bay will be spared!<br>
Chaaarge! &lt;Rear Admiral Giggleplanks waits for a few moments and then pouts.&gt; Fine, we&apos;ll wait until the tide pulls us in. That&apos;ll make it more dramatic anyways.<br>
This is the one day all year that the Fleet Admiral lets me off the leash. The one day that all of Azeroth fears. I&apos;m a wild pirate with wild pirate intentions! Booty Bay will burn... wildly!<br>
Hurry up, steed! We must reach Booty Bay by nightfall! I swear you&apos;re not even trying.<br>
Don&apos;t judge me. Not on Pirates&apos; Day!<br>
Where be ye ocean steed, matey?<br>
Avast! Stop poking me inflatable or I be keelhaulin&apos; ya!<br>
They were all out of the red ones.<br>
Does this make me look fearsome?<br>
Look at this landlubber without a sea pony! Ha!<br>
Push me towards Booty Bay so I can shout more profanities at &apos;em!<br>
I&apos;ve never felt so free!<br>
<br>
<br>
Jokes<br>
<br>
So I was gettin&apos; me ears pierced by Pretty Boy Duncan on the Brashtide yesterday...<br>
Ye know how he is. Always a perfectionist. Took two hours, and at the end of it I asked him how much I owed. He said...<br>
Just a buccaneer!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So Captain Salthoof got his first ship pretty quickly, right?<br>
I asked him how much he had to bribe the admiral with to make that happen, and he told me his secret...<br>
He got it on sail!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is one of &apos;em brain puzzles...<br>
What has six legs, six hands, and six eyes?<br>
Six pirates!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ye all know crazy Rear Admiral Giggleplanks, right?<br>
Did ye know he once used his gnomish gizmos to combine a parrot and shark into the ultimate pirate companion?<br>
It worked great... until it talked his ear off!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So what&apos;s the deal with treasure chests nowadays? They&apos;re so expensive and shiny...<br>
It&apos;s like we want people to find &apos;em! All that shiny gold edging and gem-encrusted locks...<br>
It&apos;s like, are we storing treasure on the OUTside or the INside? Right?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Alright, batten down yer hatches, mateys. This one&apos;ll blow yer rudder off...<br>
Ha, now someone get me a grog.<br>
I was drinkin&apos; with a Dread Crew gunner in Booty Bay last week...<br>
After a few drinks, he looked me in the eyes and asked how the Bloodsail got to be so great...<br>
I raised my mug and told him we just ARRR!<br>
<br>
<br>
Joke Reactions<br>
<br>
Sure, tell me a joke.<br>
Your jokes are the best!<br>
Your jokes are terrible!<br>
Yeah? Well yer face is terrible... and so is yer mother!<br>
Ha! I&apos;d like to see ye do better, scallywag!<br>
Go keelhaul yerself, ye bilge-sucking carouser.<br>
I&apos;ll cleave ye to the brisket!<br>
Shut yer trap or I&apos;ll run ye through, ye pathetic pirate wannabe!<br>
Shut yer squiffy grog hole and walk the plank, ye son of a biscuit eater!<br>
Go dance with Jack Ketch, and leave the jokes to the old salt.<br>
A black spot upon ye and all yer cockroach friends!<br>
Thank ye kindly, ye old sea dog.<br>
I&apos;ll cut ye fer... Oh wait, ye liked em? Thank ye. Nobody ever says they like &apos;em.<br>
I&apos;ve trained over countless oceans and pillages. This be authentic pirate humor!<br>
Yarrr! Splice the mainbrace!<br>
No hornswaggle? I thank ye kindly for that, friend.<br>
Aye, then buy me a clap of thunder, would ye?<br>
Spread the word. Tell &apos;em ol&apos; Bad News ain&apos;t so bad afterall.<br>
Thank ye, matey. Treasure ain&apos;t always found in chests.<br>
<br>
<br>

Ya ever seen the ocean burn?<br>
Booty Bay will burn!<br>
What do you know about lifting voodoo curses?<br>
Booze is mana, if you&apos;re tough enough.<br>
A cutlass, a spell, a bottle of booze. What more could a Bloodsail want?<br>
Today, we all be pirates. But tomorrow, ya got ta earn dese colors.<br>
You haven&apos;t lived until you&apos;ve sang shanties at sunrise in the salty mists of the sea.<br>
I haven&apos;t trained at any of the famous academies, but I&apos;ve sacked all of &apos;em!<br>
When the Bloodsail raided my family&apos;s fishing boat, they didn&apos;t just kill everyone I&apos;ve ever loved. They rescued me from a mundane life severely lacking in treasure and grog! A pirate&apos;s life for me!<br>
Grog, grog... I love grog!<br>
Grog, grog... Don&apos;t eat a log!<br>
Greg, greg... Get me some grog!<br>
And don&apos;t lose ya leg...<br>
Can ya believe I just made that up?<br>
If ya need a pig cooked for the barbecue later, just let me know. I do a perfect searing flame.<br>
Cowardly Crosby deserves what&apos;s comin&apos; to him.<br>
Everyone wants to be a Bloodsail, but only a few got the guts to do what it takes.<br>
Haven&apos;t I seen you below deck before? Or maybe it&apos;s just the grog talkin...<br>
Ya like treasure, landlubber? Too bad! It&apos;s all ours!<br>
You look familiar... Didn&apos;t I ransack your coastal villa once? Ha, yeah! I&apos;m sure it was you! Your servants all ran screaming into the vineyards, right? And then we burnt the whole place to the ground? Good times.<br>
No landlubbers!<br>
Let&apos;s put the blood in Bloodsail!<br>
Bloodsail or no sail!<br>
No one messes with the Bloodsail!<br>
The Bloodsail party&apos;s never gonna end!<br>
Hands off the treasure, scallywag.<br>
No splashing in the water!<br>
You&apos;re in Bloodsail territory now.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Stupid Giggleplanks send me... secret spynapping... never show up... I got a life too!<br>
Today&apos;s MY day! I&apos;m a pirate... Yeah, I&apos;m AAAAALL the pirates! Take that, Dread Crew!<br>

Is Vindictive Gladiator gear from Legion season 1 &amp; 2 still obtainable?<br>
The Vindictive Gladiator ensembles are obtainable from vendors in Greymane Enclave and Windrunner Sanctuary. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/854825501134774272))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
I&#x2019;m wondering what the WoW team&#x2019;s thought process behind only doing +5 to level cap in Cat/MoP was. Even now, it seems weird.<br>
At the time, we felt compelled to offer new abilities and new talents every level and we were worried about the ability bloat and talent trees that required multiple pages of scrolling. We were adding new abilities as leveling rewards, not because the classes really needed them. Then we&#x2019;d have to deal with how to make all of those abilities relevant in combat rotations, balancing them, solving PvP problems and so on. <br>
<br>
But having 5 levels caused problems too. Level progression felt really slow. Chilton described it as pedaling really fast on a bike in the wrong gear while making only marginal progress. That XP bar would just creep along. Yet we didn&#x2019;t want to make 5 levels take less time than 10 levels, or the Cat content would have felt skimpy and a lot of the leveling content would never get used. (The later zones in Cat rarely were seen as it is.)<br>
<br>
Getting levels is fun in WoW. It makes the questing relevant. So we decided to go back to 10 levels and just not offer so many level-up rewards.<br>
<br>
(To a much lesser degree, we were also worried about veteran players outstripping new players by so much. If you played BC and took a break until Cataclysm, you suddenly had months of leveling ahead of you before you could see the new content everyone was talking about. Having only 5 levels in Cat made this slightly better. Boosting would later solve this problem.)<br>
<br>
I have no idea what the WoW team thinks about those decisions now. If they go to 5 or even 20 levels next expansion, don&#x2019;t blame me. (Source (https://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/158985342893/im-wondering-what-the-wow-teams-thought-process))<br>
