Warlords of Draenor - Druid Mythic Tier 17 Armor Set
We previously looked at the Normal Druid Tier 17 set here , which was missing a helm. Today we are taking a look at the Mythic Tier 17 set, which includes animated wings.

You can see two of the more popular druid races towards the end of the high quality preview video, or try the set on any race you would like with the modelviewer below.

Character Viewer Updated: Female Orc!
Glory. Power. Victory.

The daughter of Draenor  stands ready to achieve all three, thanks to new visual and animation updates we're making to the female Orc model in the next World of Warcraft expansion.


<div class="gallery" id="femorcgal">     </div> 

In making changes to the model for Warlords of Draenor, the World of Warcraft art team  wanted to evoke the spirit of the original while making sure her new representation felt even more alive and vivid than before. But don't just take our word for it—see for yourself! We’ve updated the character viewer on the Warlords of Draenor website  with the new female Orc model and new emote screenshots. We hope you enjoy them!

As development continues on Warlords of Draenor, we’ll show you even more of the updated character models. Let us know what you think!


Alpha Realms Offline - June 20-23
The next Alpha build should be here early this week, opening Shadowmoon Valley and the Alliance characters.
We're in the process of bringing down the Alpha realms while we work to resolve this issue. Unfortunately, it's going to require an updated build, which we won't be able to finish today. Realms will remain offline over the weekend while we get everything ironed out. We hope to be able to bring the Alpha back up on Monday, June 23rd.

Again, we greatly appreciate your patience during this time. We'll get you back to Draenor as soon as we possibly can.

the "of the black harvest title" is character specific to the warlock that earned it, correct?
Yes, only warlocks can use the title. WatcherDev 
So 2 90 locks on same account, one with, one without the achievement, do both have title?
Yes. WatcherDev 

PvE
I freakin' LOVE the idea of scenarios that take us through old instances. LOVE. Colour me excited!
I hate to dampen enthusiasm but I wouldn't think of these as scenarios. More like a direction/goals overlay on our dungeons. WatcherDev 
Yeah that's gonna maybe need a rename. People will start calling everything a scenario 
The word "scenario" will not appear in the final dungeon UI. WatcherDev 
More guidance regarding what you're supposed to do, and the ability for us to reward bonus gold/XP for killing optional bosses WatcherDev 
Is this for levelling up characters? Will it grant rewards repeatedly to make DG lvling smoother?
Yes, that's another benefit. We're moving a lot of the dungeon XP from one-time quests to repeatable objectives. WatcherDev 

Did Garrosh learn some new moves? He switched up his rotation defile/whirling corruption a couple of times in P2.
It's always been mostly a coin-flip based on AI timing for that second Desecrate/Whirl in p2; they both come off cooldown at once. WatcherDev 

Ah, does a level 80 in 300 gear become invincible to attacks, including 25HC LK? Not that it really concerns you at this point
By the current logic, yes, though that logic isn't by any means final. That breakpoint is especially challenging, because.. Celestalon 
...of the BoE gear available at level 80 that can massively inflate ilvl. Celestalon 

Anything to report on combat logs being able to see all phases? I don't want to have to implement log merging! 
Still working on it unfortunately. Had it functional, but it made phased players show as in range on unit frames, which is bad WatcherDev 
can't you add an invisible debuff that separate phases? a diferent one for each phase so the client behaves prop
We can do a lot of things. Not saying it's unsolvable, just that we don't have a 100% working version yet. WatcherDev 

PvP
What else besides hks, caps, and node defending calculates honor gain in a bg? Is damage/healing output a factor?
Damage/healing isn't. The BG score is though. holinka 

UI / Addons
Also Char specific macro slots? :3
Character specific wasn't feasible unfortunately but you'll have over 100 account slots up from 36 now. holinka 
FINALLY, what about bnet friendlist?
it's very high on the list and not as trivial as some might think holinka 


Computers - Setup of the Month
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices  are stable, with all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. 

The new Haswell Refresh CPUs  are here this week, and just like their predecessors they run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14  Release is Wednesday 6/25 in the US and they appear to run slightly cooler with a slightly higher max overclock.

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4790K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions! If you are interested in Folding@home, take a look in our team's thread
