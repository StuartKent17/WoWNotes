Boubouille2009-01-04, 07:07 PMPatch 3.0.8 - Enchantment changes
Blue posts mentioned a few times the changes made to enchantments in 3.0.8 but I never took the time to list them. Hopefully the forums are full of wonderful people and TheRabidDeer ;u=7034 made a nice list on our forums !

Blue posts
Survavibility and fun in Arenas
I would say we are definitely worried that players are dying too fast, particularly to a handful of specs that combine high damage with high survivability. We know resilience will make a difference, but they jury is still out on whether it will make enough of a difference. Regardless, it's clear a lot of players aren't having fun, so it is something we are talking about. Source 

[...] All I have ever said was that damage will be lower when everyone is at full resilience. Will damage be low enough then? I have never answered that because I think the jury is out. I understand many players think damage will still be too high. We certainly take their opinions and numbers into account when we discuss it. Source 

1v1 PvP
We do not balance 1v1 PvP. We make virtually no attempt to insure that all specs are viable at dueling. It's a fun distraction at best, perhaps a way to test our your abilities against a specific class. Source 

Damage / Healing / Crowd Control in Arenas
Yes, I said that. If you are disagreeing with that remark, then you are essentially saying "It shouldn't be a viable tactic to kill a healer."

If you aren't saying that, then all we're really quibbling over is a matter of degree.

I didn't say it should be trivial to kill a healer. I purposefully didn't specify how many people it should take to kill a healer. I didn't say that we were happy with how easy it is to currently kill a healer. But if you are anticipating a point where you just laugh at warriors or shamans or other classes without brutal CC and drains, then you might be disappointed. Source 

[...] I made an unclear post that ended up setting a lot of people off. I did not mean dps classes should be able to faceroll healers. I did not mean that one dps should be a match for one healer. I did not mean that CC should have no role in Arenas. I did not mean that healing should have no role in Arenas. I did not mean that we think healers are finally getting their just deserts in season 5.

The best way I can think to say it is: Burst damage should not dominate Arenas. Crowd control should not dominate Arenas. Healing should not dominate Arenas.

I don't think this is really news to people who have been doing Arenas very long. Source 

[...] My point was that we don't give every spec the ability to stunlock, sheep or silence. And we're not going to. But those specs still need to feel like they can contribute in an Arena. Understanding the concerns now, I should have said something more like "It should still be possible for warriors and shamans to take on and sometimes defeat healers even if it takes 2v1 or 3v1 or whatever." Crowd control should not be the dominant factor in Arenas. Neither should burst damage. Source 

[...] I will just leave it at this: When you put a healer on your team, you need to feel that the dps you lose from not having another dps class is more than offset by the survivability brought by the healing. I'm cool with all damage teams existing, so long as there aren't too many of them and they take big risks from neglecting healing. Source 

Heirloom items and LVL 1-79 balance
We do take them into consideration. For example, we do put some thought into the structure of the talent trees based on when classes get new abilities. Part of the whole design of hierloom items was to give players who have reached max level a reason to go try another for some of us, yet another class.

We don't spend much effort balancing PvP or PvE for levels below the max level, since nearly all player balance concerns are about max level. Source 

No Deadly/Hateful Band of Salvation available
I'll look into the healer ring issue. Source 

ETA on Healing mechanics changes
I have given an ETA and I will give another one. It will be a long time. Do not look for it in the next patch or so. We want to take a comprehensive look at healing the way we did at tanking, and that took a long time. Healing may even be trickier to change. I also always add when I comment on this topic that you should not assume that all or even most healers hate healing or even find it clunky at best. Many players love healing and we have to be careful not to break the game for them. Source 

51 Points talents
That is not our design. If the 51-point talent defines the tree then you are closing the door on a hybrid spec of some kind ever being viable. The rest of a talent tree should not be filler to reach the 51 pointer. That is why we budget them exactly the same as the first tier talents. Now there are specs for which the 51 feels more mandatory and those for which it feels less mandatory. We’re okay with that too. Talent trees should be diverse and what works for one class might not work for another. Source 

 Death Knight Skills List  / Talent + Glyph Calc. 
Rune Strike
Rune Strike is largely to make up for the fact that DK tanks are really penalized for failing to land attacks. For example if you open with a Plague Strike and get a miss or dodge, your rotation is thrown off and your threat will be lower.

It is dependent on a proc so that you have an incentive to hit other buttons and to make it less useful when doing dps. It is on next swing so that it doesn't tie up a GCD. It can't be avoided so that DKs who miss a Plague Strike and a Rune Strike aren't doubly screwed. Source

Tenacity pets not receiving the +10% baseline damage buff
Sorry, I can't offer commentary on every bug in the game. This one is fixed. Source 

Cat and Scorpid changes in 3.0.8
I don’t think I was clear enough: the PTR build does not reflect the new numbers for cat and scorpid. If I remember, I will post what those new numbers are since there seems to be a lot of concern about it but I don't have them in front of me. Source 

Hunter changes in 3.0.8
On the actual topic, we are pretty happy with the numbers we can generate for hunters with the changes. However, I will certainly bring up with the team that many hunters have posted some even after testing that the nerfs were too severe, especially to BM. Source
