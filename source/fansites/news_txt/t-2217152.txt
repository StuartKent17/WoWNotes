Spring Balloon Festival
Spring Balloon Festival  allows players to take a short balloon ride around a zone.


Head to one of the red X markers on the world map to find a balloon.
Once there, speak to the pilot and he will let you sign up to ride.
Actually taking a ride requires a total of three players, so you will have to wait for more players to show up.
The ride will take you elsewhere in the zone and play some dialogue along the way.
You may learn useful things such as the traditional greeting in Suramar city  
At the end of the ride you are dropped off and the balloon disappears.

Upcoming Mythic Keystone Changes
Patch 7.2.5 is making some changes to Mythic Keystone dungeons 
One additional change we're making that should hit in the next PTR build, with the goal of providing some extra incentive to run difficulties past the item level cap.

For every Keystone level above 15, you'll have an increasing chance for the final chest to contain additional loot. This chance scales linearly, will roll over past 100%, and accumulates pretty quickly: at level 20, you'll be guaranteed 4 pieces of loot, plus a 5th if you beat the timer.


Patch 7.2.5 PTR - Build 24076 Armor Sets
The PTR build last night added some new Chromie themed armor sets.

Windwalker T20 4pc Bug
Seems to me when you crit with RSK the timer on FoF is not dropping at all. I've stared at the cd timer during sessions with the practice dummies and not once did I see the numbers skip down 2 secs. I even had the combat log opened to see if I was critting with RSK. 
This is fixed in a future build, thanks for the report. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
