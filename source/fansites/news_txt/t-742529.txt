Boubouille2010-07-26, 09:11 AMDungeon Sets Preview - Cloth Armor Sets
Shanai posted an interesting posts on the forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/738254-Possibly-the-cloth-Dungeon-4-set-%28big-image-warning%29 a few days ago. The first dungeon sets have been added to the beta files and Cloth sets are now available. 

They are dungeon sets 5-man gear, they are NOT class raid sets. These sets drop from 5-man dungeons and possibly aren't even real "sets" with bonuses 

Screenshots from Ravenheart.eu http://ravenheart.eu/ are pretty good, it looks like I'm not the only one in the world who is crazy enough to do that kind of stuff.

Cataclysm Beta Build 12604 - NPCs Transcripts Spoiler
I'm not a huge fan of spoiling lore and dialogues but the requests for transcripts of sounds files have been overwhelming. From now on, I will list new sound files after each beta build and try to provide a transcript for them. In this case I also included a couple of audio/videos, courtesy of Tural http://www.youtube.com/user/TuralX18

Obviously, do not read anything below if you do not like spoilers

Thanks to Marla for the transcripts of this patch.

VO_QE_Deathwing_Event06.wav - "Argh. You think to entrap me?!"

VO_QE_Sylvanas_Hunt04.wav - "What kind of question is that? Ofcourse we are deploying the plague, as planned. Let the Gilneans enjoy their small victory. Not even their bones will remain by tomorrow."

VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent09.wav - "While there, a wise old war hero told me something, that I would carry with me forever."
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent10.wav - "Honor, Grom'gar. No matter how dire the battle, never forsake it."
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent11.wav - "Overlord Grom'gar, you have disgraced the Horde!"
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent12.wav - "You have brought shame to us as a people."

VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent18.wav - "Grom'gar's army is no more. Your rank no longer has meaning. If you wish to truly help the horde, your considerable power could be used in Desolace, or in the Southern Barrens."

VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_TILEvent01.wav - "Fellow warriors of the Horde, hear me now!" 
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_TILEvent02.wav - "Ahead hides our foe. Worshippers of chaos, who seek to remake our world. A new world is coming, friends. But it is not the world of their design. Together, we will crush the Twilight's Hammer. Raise their stronghold. Raise the earth, and burn the bodies. All will tremble by our might. Then we will stand upon? this world as its masters. United at our conviction. Unrivaled in strength. Behold into no one! ? Today we will make the world, our world! FOR THE HORDE!"

Blue Posts
Class Development Status
I'd say that at this point in time, the trees that are farthest along are mage, rogue, shaman and warrior. Paladin would be close except that things have changed so much that we still have to move talents around quite a bit. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262927372/a-few-words-on-talent-tree-design/

DPS Classes Overhaul
Sure, and Fury is the kind of tree that needs a lot of adjustment because so many of the talents are "you do more damage" of various kinds and there are still some we haven't been able to prune quite yet. But I've also seen a lot of posts where say a Shadow priest or Feral druid imagines they are getting a paladin-level overhaul with half of their spells new. Neither the Shadow or Feral trees are done yet, but the bones are there. You'll see talent slide around or maybe one or two new ones added, but they aren't getting new resources unless you call the orbs a resource, and we aren't removing say Lacerate or Mind Flay. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262927372/a-few-words-on-talent-tree-design/

Raid Buff Costs
The thing is, Rampage is a sizeable dps increase for 1 talent point. If all you ever do is raid and you know you'll always have another version, then I guess you're safer skipping it. If you ever solo or run 5-player dungeons, it's a nice benefit to have. If you have the luxury of spending your dual-spec on your solo Fury build, then again, Rampage might be a luxury. This is one of the reasons though that we are hesitant to offer more specs. At one talent point, Rampage should be a no brainer. If it cost 2 or 3 points for a buff someone else might bring, then I could see skipping it in a raid.

Likewise, if like the Frost mage, every Survival hunter, Ret paladin etc. decides that someone else will bring Replenishment, then nobody will have it. :

Talent builds are supposed to be about evaluating the pros and cons of every talent. If you can quickly tailor your talent build to the other folks you are playing with, then you are just avoiding the cons. Situational talents can be skipped until you're in the situation that needs them. Dual spec was conceived so that players could tank or dps or raid and PvP, not so that you could skip over situational talents and yet still be able to use them as needed. For all the good that dual-spec has done, it has done some harm too. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262927372/a-few-words-on-talent-tree-design/

Vengeance
Think of Vengeance like the way Tricks of the Trade works on live. It isn't the silver bullet that is supposed to solve all your threat problems. It's there to make sure that other classes don't outscale you as you keep piling on Stamina and they keep piling on damage.

Your normal threat rotation should be sufficient to keep aggro in most situations. Vengeance falling off periodically shouldn't be a big deal. Offtanks without Vengeance shouldn't be a big deal. We want you so still care, insofar as tanks ever care, about the damage you're doing. Vengeance is a cushion, not the solution to threat management. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262707768/plans-for-the-vengeance-mechanic/

Tanks and DPS Talents
It is particularly a challenge with tanks once they are ready to sub-spec into other trees. A Prot warrior for instance looks at the Arms and Fury tree and sees all these dps talents, and assumes he has to get all of those to hold threat. Yet, we can't very well make the top two tiers of Arms and Fury with no dps talents. Hopefully the way it will work out is that tanks will need "some" dps and can decide whether to get those talents in Arms, Fury and Prot, but won't feel the need to get them all.

There are some tanks who get some things "for free" while others need to talent into it. As long as the end result is similar it should feel okay. Part of what we are dealing with is all these brand new talents or old favorites that have changed a lot. You don't have the years fo experience and theorycrafting to fall back on so you don't know yet if say Thunderstruck is mandatory it shouldn't be.

There will be some amount of dps talents in all trees. Some players will call any dps talent that doesn't require them to click something "passive and boring" but we also think there is a limit to the number of procs, stacking buffs, and using base spells in unusual ways that a player can manage. We'll have some of those talents for sure, but not 20 of them per tree. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262927372/a-few-words-on-talent-tree-design/

Death Knight Rotations
One thing I'll throw out there is we're definitely trying to keep the feel of Unholy with a more predictable rotation and Frost with more of a priority system, since what ability to use next can't always be guessed in advance. DKs seem to like those play styles for the two trees respectively. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262927588/dk-tanks-and-being-rune-locked/

Hunter Redesign?
No, hunters are not undergoing any kind of massive redesign. We have spent our efforts lately on trying to make sure focus works as intended in both aspects and at low and high level. We're not there yet. We'll work on the talent trees a little more when we feel like focus is where we want it to be, since that will affect the talent design.

Holy Power as Protection
It's entirely possible there isn't enough Holy Power to go around for Prot yet. We want you to be able to consider things like Inquisition and Word of Glory. Remember too that it's only 15% block. If it falls down from time to time, you're unlikely to drop dead. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262766511/paladin-shield-of-the-righteous/

Raging Blow / Fury in the Blood
Raging Blow -- We want this to be an ability that can't be used 100% of the time. We don't want Fury to have very static and boring rotations. We're going to try to keep Fury enraged a lot without it being 100% up time somehwere in the 75% range sounds better. As such, we're not crazy about a design that lets you hit Raging Blow whenever you want. It just waters down the ability. In fact, we feel the same way about Execute and are considering redesigning Sudden Death for Arms. We think we can make Fury's use of enrage predictable enough without being totally under player control that your dps won't fluctuate wildly from fight to fight.

Fury in the Blood -- I think a little bit of the "we won't be able to use our utility abilities correctly" is a little overblown. For starters, you don't need to use Bloodrage and Berseker Rage all that much. Fury has a lot of other ways to generate rage, and fears just aren't super common in PvE and you have other ways to break them in PvP. In those situations where they do come up, we think it's an interesting choice. Is the boss going to fear? Maybe you want to save your Berserker Rage for a few seconds and use it then. There are going to be very, very few fights where it's a true dps loss to delay or save your Berserker Rage for the right time. Frankly, we'd rather have encounters feel more different like this, where abilities are more valuable or have to be used differently sometimes. I compare it to Arcane's mana gem talent. Sometimes you want to use the gems for mana and sometimes spellpower and sometimes both. That makes the decision on when to use the gem deeper than just "on cooldown."

Now all of that is really just an endorsement of Raging Blow, not Fury in the Blood. In fact, with Raging Blow being the primary reason to stay enraged, we're just not sure we also need the bonus damage from the Fury in the Blood abilities. With say Enrage and Death Wish providing the enrage sometimes, you should have to fall back on Bloodrage and Berserker Rage less often, which should let you save them for emergencies more often but not always, as I said above.

In short, we like Raging Blow, but not Fury in the Blood and will likely redesign the latter. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262707531/raging-blow-redesign/

Intended use of Bloodrage
If you have to pop Bloodrage on cooldown for rage, then we've failed. It's there for emergencies, not as the primary way you gain rage. Hitting things is the primary way you gain rage.

Just because rage won't always be unlimited doesn't mean that it will go to always being limited either. If that was the case then we wouldn't need abilities like Heroic Strike or Inner Rage. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227192817/warrior-changes-12539-and-12604/
