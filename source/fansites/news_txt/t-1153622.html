The Lorewalker Stories<br>
In Mists of Pandaria there are several extra lore related achievements (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/character/exploration/pandaria) to go with the regular zone exploration achievements. <br>
<br>
Once you have found all of the objects for an achievement, Lorewalker Cho will send you mail that asks you to meet him at the Seat of Knowledge. Once there he will narrate a small story that gives you some more information about Pandaria lore. <br>
<br>
In the video below, the Song of the Yaungol (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/6847-the-song-of-the-yaungol) and Hozen in the Mist (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/6850-hozen-in-the-mist) stories are told to you.<br>

UI Addons Enabled in the Next Beta Build<br>
Starting with the next Mists of Pandaria beta build, we plan to enable the use of UI addons. So whether you&#x2019;re a savvy addon author or the most discriminating player, there&#x2019;s no time like the present to start planning out your perfect UI. <br>
<br>
Addon authors should also make sure to check out prominent addon sites such as WoWInterface and Curse for a chance to apply for a Mist of Pandaria beta key. These sites have recently been given a lot of beta keys to distribute specifically to active addon authors. We likewise strongly encourage authors who have access to the beta to start testing out and fine-tuning their addon updates in the beta as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
If you use an addon and start seeing errors, try downloading the most recent version of it. If you are still having errors, you may need to turn off the addon until it has been updated.<br>
<br>
<br>

Lack of New Content<br>
Where has all of the updates gone. I can&apos;t remember the last time anything was added to this game. I know blizard is busy and blah blah, but nothing?? really? where does that 15 bucks a month go. I know most of you will say &quot;Just quit&quot; and I probably will, but I miss enjoying the game. The raids are easy and the content is old.<br>
We&apos;re working on the next expansion. We understand that people want new content and are hungry for it, but we have to also be able to recognize when we need to put our efforts into the next expansion rather than trying to divide up our focus too much.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m sure many of those that are in the beta will say that it&apos;s come a long long way. We&apos;re making great progress and are looking forward to getting the expansion out to everyone as soon as we possibly can. <br>
<br>
There is still a lot to do in the game that perhaps you&apos;ve never taken the time to do in the past. I acknowledge that doesn&apos;t make-up to many people the lack of new shiny things to do, but we&apos;re hoping we&apos;ll make the wait worthwhile for you. <br>
<br>
We&apos;ve been running summer challenges as well that we hope inspire people to go back to see older content again or perhaps even for the first time. <br>
<br>
There&apos;s a lot to do in World of Warcraft. The limitations often are self-imposed, such as if you don&apos;t like PvP or don&apos;t like Raiding or Achievements. Many people are spending their time with Transmogrification right now as well.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m sure there are many others who could give you some great ideas of things you could try.<br>
<br>
Is there an ETA?<br>
None that I can share yet. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/228182-new-content-ever/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5960196169?page=1#30))<br>
<br>
Why is WoW Never Balanced?<br>
Balance! You mean you guys actually balance this game, that&apos;s the first I heard of this. Right now we will hear how you are trying to balance the new expansion. I will bet my life on it that the monks and the new cuddly utterly hateable pandas will be either so weak or way over powered. Your developers never seem to get it right when it comes to balance.<br>
Let&apos;s get one thing straight here. World of Warcraft (and all MMOs) are in a constant state of being balanced and tweaked. As more content or more game changes are added, so too must additional balancing be done. There is no such thing as a &quot;finished&quot; MMO. That is the nature of them. Balance, is an ongoing work. Also, what you may think is &quot;right&quot; may not be either. It&apos;s pretty easy to sit on the other side of the fence and say, &quot;Get it right!&quot; But there are so many variables at play that it&apos;s never that simple.<br>
<br>
Also, it seems there are several discussions going on here. My comments have been directed at Heroic Dungeons and dungeons in general. I wasn&apos;t commenting on Dragon Soul. <br>
<br>
In regard to Dragon Soul: I work on a global community report each week in which every week I see a mix of people that are upset about the buff, and those that are thankful for the buff so that they can progress. It&apos;s not a black and white issue. We did something similar in Wrath of the Lich King and we changed it again for Dragon Soul. Who knows what we&apos;ll do in future raids.<br>
<br>
Yes, people can experience the Raid with the Raid Finder, but that doesn&apos;t mean their guild isn&apos;t interested in accomplishing the Raid together either. I think there is also an assumption that &quot;everyone has seen it/done it&quot; and that&apos;s not exactly true either. <br>
<br>
As to whether or not we will &quot;nerf&quot; Challenge Modes, I couldn&apos;t say. I can say we will balance the dungeons that they occur in. But they are intended to be very challenging for organized groups. There is no Challenge Mode Finder by which you can make a new group and go in with strangers.<br>
<br>
I see a lot of people upset about how this hurts their own experiences. How by making it too easy, you&apos;re getting people who may not fully understand the mechanics of some of the encounters or may not play at the top of their game. On the flip side, if only a small portion of people can get through that content, it gives you a very very limited pool of folks to be able to play with.<br>
<br>
Again, we&apos;re not in a black and white situation here. <br>
<br>
That all said, /broken record on- <br>
<br>
We are always open to constructive feedback on how you think the system could work better. No one on our side has packed up a suitcase and walked out of the studio because their work is &quot;done&quot;. We have a large team of folks who have been working their tails off to get the next expansion ready and out to you. They have been reading over the forums, listening to the community team, reading outside the forums, and still putting in their time to work on a variety of thoughts and ideas whether they came from without or within. <br>
<br>
Will things potentially be &quot;out of balance&quot; with the release of Mists of Pandaria? It&apos;s possible. Beta can only tell us so much. Even with such a large pool of people taking part, there is always a difference when it comes to the live environment. The developers do the best they can to make sure the choices they make are for the betterment of the game.<br>
<br>
Back to the topic at hand, we&apos;re back to the simplicity of the original statement I made-- Challenging is different for everyone.<br>
<br>
I would also caution people to avoid these statements, &quot;If only Blizzard had had their eyes open and brains engaged.&quot; This is not thoughtful or helpful in any way shape or form, nor is it constructive. If the developers don&apos;t agree with your ideas, that does not mean they don&apos;t have their &quot;eyes or brains engaged&quot;.<br>
<br>
A little experience that i had on my paladin....<br>
I&apos;m glad you had a great experience. I do think people are mistaking balancing for &quot;casuals&quot; with just providing balance in general. When we balance, we&apos;re not going, &quot;hey this guy can&apos;t get through the dungeon, we need to nerf that&quot;. We&apos;re looking at, &quot;hey a lot of people are getting stuck right here. Why is that?&quot; Sometimes, there&apos;s just a rough spot that we need to smooth out. That&apos;s simply it. Challenging does not mean we want people banging their heads on their desks. It means, we want them to feel that there is a challenge that they can rise to and have a chance of overcoming if they work at it. Again, it&apos;s back to the difference between frustrating (I give up) and challenging (let&apos;s go at it again).
