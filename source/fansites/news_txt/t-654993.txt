Boubouille2009-06-30, 08:41 PMUpdate - Isle of Conquest Changes
In addition to the changes originally listed in this thread, the following change was recently added and is now live on the test realms:

Players gain a new buff after being launched out of the catapult that reduces all falling damage taken.

We intend to make the following changes to Isle of Conquest in the next test realm build:

Increase siege damage from Glaive Thrower.
Increase all damage from Siege Engine and its turrets.
When the parachute effect ends from jumping off the Gunship, players will gain a new buff that reduces all falling damage taken.
Increase the timer before a Catapult without a driver explodes from 30 seconds to 120 seconds.

It would be greatly appreciated if anyone who has experienced the following bug could provide us with as much information as possible on the circumstances surrounding its cause:

Sometimes the Keep Cannons are being despawned and they never return. This should not happen.

Given that the changes originally detailed in this thread are now live, we'd love to get feedback on your experiences in this new Battleground. Is the average length of each battle better now? Did the changes to the Huge Seaforium piles help address the overly advantageous strategy of capturing the Hangar and parachuting into the enemy's base? Do the Keep Cannons still feel effective now that they do less damage given that you can now repair them? Any information you can provide on your game play experiences will help us a great deal to make this Battleground as fun as possible. Thanks!

Crusader's Coliseum Audio Video
Nakriel posted http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=70122.0 a really nice video of all the sound clips introduced with the latest PTR patch. Do not listen to it if you don't like spoilers, most of the events happening in the Crusader's Coliseum are featured, including a few bits about Arthas and Anub'arak at the end of the video.

Known combat mechanic bug in current PTR build
On the current PTR build, there is a bug with the proc code itself causing it to behave strangely. You are likely to see bugs on the PTR with anything related to procs. This includes talents such as Art of War, etc.

There is an unrelated bug with Ardent Defender that makes Prot paladins more and more survivable as their health approaches zero such that it is literally impossible to kill them... though Chaos Bolt might work.

Take any balance issues on the current build with a grain of salt. We will try to get a new PTR build up soontm.

Stonekeeper Shards quest rewards and achievements
It is intended that the quests that provide Stone Keeper's Shards don't count toward the achievement as the goal is to get the achievement by looting them. Yes, the text in the achievement could use an update which we may do in the future, but I have no eta on when that may or may not happen.

Allowing Engineers to change specs
It's definitely something we'd like to do. We'll let you know when we can provide a better answer than this. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/15/18031369889-engineering-is-now-awesome.html

Warrior Mechanics

There are some mechanics we'd like to change with warriors, as I have already stated. Having to spam Heroic Strike is definitely one of them. Rage starvation is never fun which is not the same as "I can ignore rage." This is a slightly different argument that whether or not warriors have the stats they need to do the job, which seems to be the bigger concern in this forum at the moment. I am personally not particularly interested in who is the "easier" tank. I don't think any of them are significantly different from each other. You still have to know when to use your cooldowns, when to swap your gear, how to coordinate with your raid and when it's you that's the problem and not your class.

I think it's easy to argue against your point that warriors have not gotten a pretty hefty overhaul this expansion. We changed the warrior Protection tree a lot more than the paladin Protection tree or the Feral tree. We made you press Shield Block less often and Shield Wall more often. We changed Thunderclap and Devastate and Shield Slam and so forth. My point here is: don't dilute your arguments. I hear a lot of players saying that warrior survivability is lower than other tanks. Okay, that is feedback we can use. I hear them saying, as you did, that some of the mechanics still need to be updated. That is feedback we can use. Saying you are neglected or somehow other tanks got more changes than you or whatever... that is hard to use. We don't balance around "neglect." We balance around numbers. Theorycrafted numbers and simulations are valuable. Actual encounters with a boss are even more valuable.

China Limits Use Of Virtual Currency 
In addition to its ongoing crackdown on Internet porn, the Chinese government has declared that virtual currency cannot be traded for real goods or services. Virtual currency, as defined by Chinese authorities, includes "prepaid cards of cyber-games," according to a joint release issued by China's Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Commerce on Friday.

"The virtual currency, which is converted into real money at a certain exchange rate, will only be allowed to trade in virtual goods and services provided by its issuer, not real goods and services," the Ministries said. The Chinese government estimates that trade in virtual currency exceeded several billion yuan last year, a figure that it claims has been growing at a rate of 20% annually. One billion yuan is currently equal to about $146 million.

The ruling is likely to affect many of the more than 300 million Internet users in China, as well as those in other countries involved in virtual currency trading. In the context of online role playing games like World of Warcraft, virtual currency trading is often called gold farming. The most popular form of virtual currency in China is called "QQ coins," a form of virtual credit issued by Tencent.com.

Tencent.com, which has about 220 million registered users -- about as many as Facebook -- is quoted in the Chinese government news release as "resolutely" supporting the new rule. The government justifies its ban on virtual currency trading as a way to curtail gambling and other illegal online activities.

The Chinese government, however, appears to be uninterested in regulating sales of in-game items for real cash. A report in the English-language China Daily says that in-game gear is not considered virtual currency, so selling virtual items can be expected to continue. The trading of virtual currency for real cash employs hundreds of thousands of people worldwide and generates between $200 million and $1 billion annually, according to a 2008 survey conducted by Richard Heeks at the University of Manchester.

He estimates that between 80% and 85% of gold farmers are based in China.

"[M] any online games have a virtual economy and an in-game currency," he states in his survey. "Gold farmers can play in-game to make some currency. They then sell that for real money -- typically via a Web site and using the PayPal payment system -- to other players of the game."

Game companies typically forbid gold farming but committed virtual currency traders find ways around such rules. Some game companies have recognized the futility of trying to ban the practice and have built virtual commerce into their game infrastructure.
