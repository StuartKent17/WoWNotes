Disabling XP Gains on 110+ Characters<br>
Since the launch of Battle for Azeroth, we&#x2019;ve noticed an increasing trend of players turning off XP gains at level 110 in order to repeatedly powerlevel other players&#x2019; characters at an excessive rate without increasing their own level. The intention of the XP-off feature is to allow alternate characters to stay in lower-level PvP brackets or relive lower-level content, not to purposefully halt progression in content relevant to the current expansion.<br>
<br>
To curb this behavior, we plan to implement a hotfix in the coming days that will disable the ability to turn off XP gains on characters level 110 or higher. Additionally, any character of that level who already has XP disabled will find it automatically re-enabled the next time they log in.<br>

Happy Holidays!<br>
Hi all &#x2013;<br>
We just wanted to take a moment and thank all of you for supporting World of Warcraft throughout the year of 2018. We&#x2019;re grateful for your passion for World of Warcraft and we&#x2019;re lucky to have such dedicated players that are always giving us feedback on what to improve. Every year is always an epic journey, another chapter in the history of this great game, and we can&#x2019;t wait to keep things rolling in 2019!<br>
<br>
Also, as you&#x2019;d likely expect, our coverage on the forums will be down as we are out of the office over the holidays. We&#x2019;ll be spending time with our family, friends, loved ones, animals, and we hope all of you have a chance to do the same.<br>
<br>
Please keep the feedback and discussions going and we&#x2019;ll be back and in touch with you before you know it. We have a lot of goals next year based on a lot of the feedback you&#x2019;ve graciously given us as always, and we hope you guys like what we&#x2019;re working on, both in game and out of game.<br>
<br>
We hope Greatfather Winter brings you all the gifts you and your loved ones have asked for &lt;3<br>
-Community Team<br>
<br>
P.S. Remember to collect this years present under your faction&#x2019;s Winter Veil Tree after the 25th, as well as knock out the Winter Veil achievements before they go away!<br>

Ivus Loot Bug Fix and Bans<br>
Just to follow up - we needed to get some extra data together to do it properly, but yes, we&#x2019;ll be removing the items gained and issuing suspensions for those who abused this bug (with an increasing penalty based on how excessive the abuse was). The reason it&#x2019;s taken an extra few days is that we needed to make sure we were also cleaning up any extra Titan Residuum gained from this.</div></div>
