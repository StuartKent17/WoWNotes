Paragon - Mythic Mannoroth Kill Video<br>
We looked at Method&apos;s Mythic Mannoroth video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ACk8B-ZMhw) recently, so today we are taking a look at Paragon&apos;s video while we wait for more guilds to clear Mythic Hellfire Citadel. <br>

Arms Nerf Justification<br>
Prior to the nerf earlier this week, Arms was outperforming most specs by a considerable margin on virtually every fight in Hellfire Citadel. Our intent with the reduction of the 4-piece bonus this week wasn&apos;t to drastically reduce the viability of Arms Warriors, but rather to tone their DPS down just a bit and bring them more in-line with other damage dealers, while also fixing a bug that exacerbated the issue. <br>
<br>
The nerf has only been in effect for a little over 24 hours, but so far Arms still seems to be doing very well. We&apos;ll continue to monitor how this change -- along with the changes we made to other DPS specs this week -- play out in Hellfire Citadel. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/381362-revert-the-nerf-on-arms/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18300184889?page=1#12))<br>

The only reason I play Horde PVP in WoD is for the faster ques, same reason I played Alliance in MoP. Dont take my fast ques away.<br>
Why do you think it will make your queues longer? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621476125697376256))<br>
Competition for spots, beforehand the horde would go straight in the spot, now loads of ally are contending for it<br>
It is based on queue times. Currently, it would only be available when there are a lot of Alliance waiting. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621478118356750336))<br>
If it ever got to the point where the other faction was waiting too, it would turn off. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621478204360921088))<br>
<br>
If mercenary system get approved from the community on unranked pvp is there any chance to bring it to ranked arenas/rbgs? <br>
The intent of Mercenary mode is to fix long queue times caused by faction populations. Doesn&apos;t apply to Ranked PvP. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621480718481252352))<br>
<br>
Why merc mode over, say, this: http://t.co/489d3Sxca7<br>
A number of reasons. First, assuming the proposal as a non-optional thing: Sometimes Alliance just end up on Horde side. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621532630467526656))<br>
It is very jarring to suddenly be on the opposite side in starting area themed around the other faction. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621533017249460224))<br>
Second, it doesn&apos;t benefit the less represented faction in any way. Merc allows savvy players to switch sides to help. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621533392765476865))<br>
Third, we want to preserve the faction conflict in our unrated battlegrounds. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621534412509843456))<br>
<br>
In Mercenary Mode mode will players who are placed on opposite side wear the mask or is that a blog element only?<br>
The NPCs have masks. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621534578168061953))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
It&apos;s just funny, Darkmoon firewater stacking, hotfixed in 2 days. PvP gear hotfixed in two months. Fun nerf &gt; PvP<br>
Bugs and design changes are not created equal. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/621798605070819328))<br>
<br>
Mount size nerf, undocumented in 6.2 notes. Can I get clarification on this please?<br>
The change in 6.2 was too severe. We&apos;re currently discussing how to find a happy medium. We don&apos;t hate fun. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/621814186495078401))<br>
