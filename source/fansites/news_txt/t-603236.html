Season 3 Delayed<br>
Postponed to November 27th. This also include new Vindicator honor items, season 1 items buyable with honor points, and of course the season 3 items themselves.<br>
<br>
Everyone is preparing for the start of the third arena season and we&#x2019;re excited to get new items, rewards, and fresh competition going for everyone participating in the arenas.<br>
<br>
As we approach the previously announced start date we&#x2019;ve had growing concerns of what the new season requires of us to actually launch, and its proximity to the Thanksgiving holiday. Everyone wants the launch go as smoothly as possible, and in order to have resources available to tend to any issues as soon as they may spring up, we&#x2019;ve decided to delay the Season 3 start date to November 27. One week after the previously announced date.<br>
<br>
This allows us to have the quickest response time to any issues should they occur, and allows everyone to enjoy the holiday and the days leading up to it. While making everyone wait another week obviously isn&#x2019;t the optimal outcome, in the end we decided it would be much worse to start Season 3 so close to the holiday and potentially make players wait longer until a problem can be resolved. Ultimately it allows us to provide the best possible service for everyone as we launch the new season.</div></div>
