2.3.2 Updated Notes<br>
Yesterday I posted the most important updates of the patch notes but it was a bit of a mess with the Dreamhack still running. Here are the fully updated patch notes, with a few additions and link to the &quot;unofficial&quot; changes for more details. (Shaman spells mana costs, rogues and druids upgrades)<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that the undocumented changes aren&apos;t official yet and could be changed.<br>
<br>
(x) - Undocumented changes<br>
(1) - Added in 11/30 Update. <br>
<br>
General<br>
/timetest is a command that can be run to provide information on game performance. /timetest 0 turns the command off. When the command is issued, the next time a player uses a flight master to travel, certain statistics will be measured and displayed at the end of that flight. All weather effects and spawns are shutdown during the test.<br>
(1) Effects triggered from being critically hit: Many abilities and talents were changed in 2.3.0 to allow them to trigger from critical strikes that occurred while the player benefitting from them was sitting.<br>
Quest givers with blue question marks no longer show up on the minimap.<br>
NPC&apos;s who you have completed a quest for will display a question mark on mouseover rather than an exclamation point.<br>
The bank controls for the guildmaster level of a guild is now grayed out. A guildmaster always has full access to a guild bank and this cannot be changed.<br>
A &quot;Withdraw-Repair Only&quot; button has been added to the guild bank controls. If this is set for a guild rank, then that rank cannot actually withdraw funds from the guild bank, but they can still use that daily amount of money for repairs.<br>
You will now automatically stand up when attacked, even if the attack doesn&#x2019;t land.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Druids<br>
(x) Ravage (All ranks) - Damage have been changed from 350% to 385%<br>
(1) Lifebloom: When this ability is refreshed it will take on the strength of the incoming Lifebloom effect, rather than maintain the existing strength.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hunters<br>
Arcane Shot: Ranks 1-5 will once again deal bonus damage based on attack power.<br>
Aspect of the Viper effect increased. (Details (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=2506.0#classdet))<br>

Pet leveling speed has been increased.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mages<br>
Cold Snap (Frost) cooldown reduced from 10 to 8 minutes. It is now in the Ice Block position in the talent tree. This ability will no longer reset the cooldown on Fire Ward.<br>
(1) Conjure Mana Gem mana restore variance substantially reduced,(Rank 5 &#x2013; Emerald) now restores 2340 to 2460 mana and has three charges.<br>
Ice Block (Frost) is now available on the trainer to all mages at level 30.<br>
(1) Icy Veins (NEW Frost Talent) decreases casting time of all spells by 20% and increases the chance your chilling effects will freeze the target by 10%. Lasts 20 sec. 3 min cooldown. It is now in the Cold Snap position in the talent tree.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Paladins<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Rogues<br>
(x) Ambush (All Ranks) - Damage changed from 250% to 275%<br>
Cheat Death: When multiple attacks land simultaenously, all those resolved after the attack which triggered Cheat Death will now have their damage reduced by 90% as intended. However, the combat log will still report them doing full damage.<br>
Hemorrhage: Rank 4 of this ability no longer has its charges consumed by non-physical attacks and spells.<br>
(1) Hemorrhage weapon damage reduced from 125% to 110%, but the damage debuff has been increased.<br>
(1) Shadowstep now awards 1 combo point.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Shaman<br>
