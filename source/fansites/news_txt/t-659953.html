Patch 3.2 - Where can I get Epic Gems?<br>
The patch will probably hit the live servers very soon and a lot of people ask me the same question : Where can I get the Epic Gems? It shouldn&apos;t be hard to answer that, currently there are 4 ways to get them :<br>
<br>
Jewelcrafting / Prospecting<br>
You can find epic gems by prospecting Titanium Ore (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36910/titanium-ore/), it&apos;s probably not the best way to get it because Titanium is already fairly expensive but if you need as many gems as possible and don&apos;t want to wait, go for it. Prospecting Titanium will give you an epic gem 25~30% of the time, the droprate for rare gems seems to be the same, and you will always get an uncommon gem. If you&apos;re lucky enough you can even get 2 epics on the same prospect. <br>
<br>
Note: You will also get Titanium Powder (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46849/titanium-powder/) 60% of the time, you can exchange 10 of them for a Dalaran Jewelcrafter&apos;s Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/41596/dalaran-jewelcrafters-token/) and get your new recipes even faster. <br>
<br>
Alchemy<br>
New transmutations are available for these gems. (20 Hours cooldown)<br>
<br>
Transmute: Ametrine (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66658/transmute-ametrine/)<br>
Transmute: Cardinal Ruby (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66659/transmute-cardinal-ruby/)<br>
Transmute: Dreadstone (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66662/transmute-dreadstone/)<br>
Transmute: Eye of Zul (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66664/transmute-eye-of-zul/)<br>
Transmute: King&apos;s Amber (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66660/transmute-kings-amber/)<br>
Transmute: Majestic Zircon (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66663/transmute-majestic-zircon/)<br>
<br>
PvE - Emblems of Heroism<br>
You can buy any of the epic gems for Emblem of Heroism (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40752/emblem-of-heroism/). These emblems do not drop anymore in 3.2 and are replaced by Emblems of Conquest in heroic instances / raids dungeons but you can still exchange higher tier emblems. (Emblem of Conquest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/45624/emblem-of-conquest/) -&gt; Emblem of Valor (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40753/emblem-of-valor/) &gt; Emblem of Heroism (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40752/emblem-of-heroism/).<br>
<br>
[color=#A335EE]Cardinal Ruby (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36919/cardinal-ruby/), [color=#A335EE]Majestic Zircon (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36925/majestic-zircon/), [color=#A335EE]King&apos;s Amber (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36922/kings-amber/) can be bought for Emblem of Heroism (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40752/emblem-of-heroism/) x 20.<br>
[color=#A335EE]Ametrine (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36931/ametrine/), [color=#A335EE]Dreadstone (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36928/dreadstone/), [color=#A335EE]Eye of Zul (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36934/eye-of-zul/) can be bought for Emblem of Heroism (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40752/emblem-of-heroism/) x 10.<br>
<br>
PvP - Honor<br>
Last but not least, you can buy any of the epic gem for 10,000 Honor Points (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43308/honor-points/).<br>
<br>
<br>
Upcoming Upper Deck TCG Mount Changes<br>
I announced that a few weeks ago, this is now confirmed.<br>
In the upcoming content patch 3.2, Call of the Crusade, we are changing the Upper Deck Trading Card Game mounts to be Bind-on-Use instead of Bind-on-Pickup. This will allow players to sell newly redeemed TCG mounts in-game through the trade window, Auction House or via CoD. The primary goal behind this change is to help reduce the number of players who are getting scammed by trading for an invalid mount code. As part of this update, the NPC vendor functionality currently in place for these mounts will be removed, and instead the mount (both epic and non-epic when applicable), will now be immediately placed in your inventory upon the verified redemption of the code. If you have already redeemed one of these codes and have not purchased both the epic and non-epic versions from the vendor window, it&apos;s important that you do so before the patch is released.<br>
<br>
This update will affect the Spectral Tiger, Swift Spectral Tiger, X-51 Nether-Rocket, X-51 Nether-Rocket X-TREME, Big Battle Bear, and Magic Rooster Egg. Items that were obtained before the patch will not be affected by this change and will continue to be soulbound to the character that purchased them. <br>

<br>
 General &lt;ul&gt; Construction of the Crusaders&apos; Coliseum is complete. New raid normal and Heroic modes for the Crusaders&apos; Coliseum can be toggled using the Dungeon Difficulty setting. This applies to 10 and 25-player versions. 10-player (normal), 25-player (normal), 10-player (Heroic) and 25-player (Heroic) all share separate raid lockout timers. &lt;ul&gt; Trial of the Champion &lt;ul&gt; 5-player (normal and Heroic mode) dungeon. Daily quest added to the Heroic daily dungeon quest giver. [/list] Trial of the Crusader &lt;ul&gt; 10 and 25-player (normal mode) raid dungeon. [/list] Trial of the Grand Crusader &lt;ul&gt; 10 and 25-player (Heroic mode) raid dungeon. Crusaders&apos; Tribute: Active on Heroic difficulty only, the tribute system will limit players on the number of attempts the raid is allotted each week. Additional rewards can be earned depending on the number of attempts left in the tribute run each week when the final boss is defeated. [/list] [/list] Isle of Conquest, the new 40 vs. 40-player siege-style battleground is now available for testing. &lt;ul&gt; Two level brackets are available: 71-79 and 80. Defend the walls of your keep and protect your general by killing enemy players and destroying their siege vehicles. Capture the Docks, Gunship Hangar, or Siege Workshop for access to destructive siege vehicles or strategic attacks on your enemy&apos;s base. Capture the Refinery or Quarry for their resources to garner reinforcements, a steady flow of bonus honor and a 15% increase to siege vehicle damage for each of these capture points your team controls. To claim victory, bust through the enemy&apos;s keep walls (or find other ways to get inside) and kill their general, or obliterate your opponents until their reinforcements are depleted. [/list] The Argent Tournament Expands &lt;ul&gt; All new Argent Crusader daily quests and rewards have been added for players with the Crusader title. Rewards include a new Argent Crusader banner and tabard (which can port players to the tournament grounds), a mounted squire (can periodically run bank, mail or vendor errands for the player), a paladin-exclusive Argent Crusader Charger mount, and new heirloom items. All new Silver Covenant and Sunreaver daily quests and rewards have been added for players exalted with these factions. Rewards include tabards, new ground and flying mounts, and a new pet. Just when you thought you had seen the last of the Black Knight, he makes his astonishing return to the tournament. Wait, didn&apos;t you kill him? [/list] New Dungeon Loot Feature &lt;ul&gt; Players will now be able to trade soulbound items with other raid or group members that were eligible for the loot. This system will work like the Item Buy Back system and allow 2 hours for players to trade an item after it has been looted. Players who choose to enchant or add gems to the item will get one last confirmation before losing the ability to trade the item. [/list] New druid art for Cat Form and Bear Form has been added. There are now five unique color schemes for each form and faction. Changing hair color (night elves) or skin tone (tauren) via the barbershop will change the look of one&apos;s cat and bear forms. Copied Test Realm characters will no longer be copied with their achievement history in order to better facilitate the character copy process. [/list] &lt;/p&gt; <br>
<br>
 PvP &lt;ul&gt; Arenas &lt;ul&gt; Beginning with season 7, players will no longer have access to the newest season&apos;s weapons or shoulder armor and will not qualify for the Gladiator title/rewards with ratings from the 2v2 bracket alone. Ratings obtained through 3v3 and 5v5 game play will be required for these rewards, while the rest of the newest season&apos;s items will remain available to players in all brackets (standard rating restrictions still apply). Dalaran Sewers &lt;ul&gt; The entire Arena has increased in size by 25%. Mounts can now be used in this Arena. The position and collision of the crates on the central platform has been modified. [/list] Ring of Valor &lt;ul&gt; The flame wall has been removed. [/list] Ruins of Lordaeron &lt;ul&gt; Alcoves have been removed from the starting chambers. The collision around the central tomb has been smoothed out to prevent players from becoming stuck on the terrain as often. [/list] [/list] Battlegrounds &lt;ul&gt;  Battleground experience has arrived! &lt;ul&gt; Players will now be awarded experience for completing objectives and actions that yield honor in Battlegrounds (honorable kills not included). Players who do not wish to gain experience through PvP can visit Behsten in Stormwind or Slahtz in Orgrimmar - both located near the Battlemasters in either city - and turn off all experience accumulation for the cost of 10 gold. Disabling experience gains will prevent a player from gaining experience through any means available in the game. Players with experience gains turned off who compete in Battlegrounds will face off only against other players with experience gains turned off. Behsten and Slahtz can reinstate experience gains for players, for a 10 gold fee of course. Any experience that would&apos;ve been accumulated if experience gains were enabled cannot be recovered. [/list] Battlemasters in major cities affiliated with specific Battlegrounds have been replaced with a Battlemaster for each faction that will allow players to queue for any Battleground. Battlemasters for specific Battlegrounds will still be seen around the cities during corresponding Battleground holiday weekends. When standing at a capture point that you control, you will gain a buff called Honorable Defender. This buff grants +50% honor gained from kills. This currently affects Arathi Basin, Eye of the Storm and Isle of Conquest. Arathi Basin &lt;ul&gt; The time it requires to capture a base has been reduced to 8 seconds, down from 10 seconds. The game now ends when one team reaches 1600 victory points, down from 2000. [/list] Eye of the Storm &lt;ul&gt; The time it requires to capture the center flag has been reduced to 8 seconds, down from 10 seconds The game now ends when one team reaches 1600 victory points, down from 2000. [/list] Strand of the Ancients &lt;ul&gt; The faction starting on attack/defense will now be randomized at the start of each match. [/list] Warsong Gulch &lt;ul&gt; There is a now a 20-minute timer on this Battleground. After that time, the team with the most flag captures wins. If this would result in a tie, the team that captured the first flag wins. If neither side has captured a flag, then the game ends in a tie. [/list] [/list] Wintergrasp &lt;ul&gt; Against the Odds: This achievement has been removed and converted to a Feat of Strength. Industrial Warfare: This achievement has been removed. To provide players with a more transparent notification of when Wintergrasp battles occur, as well as better control zone population and stability, several changes have been made. &lt;ul&gt; Players now have the option to queue for Wintergrasp from a Wintergrasp Battlemaster in any capital city or by simply entering the Wintergrasp zone. Queuing will begin 15 minutes before each battle. If chosen, you will automatically be teleported to the zone. Any players in the zone who have not been chosen from the queue will be teleported out when the battle begins. The queue system remains active for the entire battle. As soon as a player leaves, a new one will be chosen from the queue. Trying to enter Wintergrasp during an active battle for which you have not been chosen will teleport you out. Please note that, as you are now able to fly over Wintergrasp, you will only be teleported out if you try to land and join the battle. Level 80 players get higher priority in the queue than lower level players. In addition, a random selection of queued players will be taken from both the Battlemasters and the zone itself. The queue will accept up to 120 players from each faction, resulting in a maximum battle of 240 players at a time. [/list] Wintergrasp factories can no longer be damaged or destroyed. [/list] [/list] &lt;/p&gt; <br>
<br>
 Dungeons and Raids &lt;ul&gt; Dungeon and Raid ID Extensions &lt;ul&gt; In order to allow for parties and raids to progress through instances at their own pace, players can now extend an instance ID on an individual basis. Existing or recently expired IDs can be extended via the Social tab under Raid by clicking on Raid Info. The ID of any instance to which a player is saved can be extended. Doing so will extend the instance lock period by the same amount of time as the original lock (i.e. extending an Ulduar instance ID will add 7 days, a Heroic: Halls of Lightning instance ID will add 24 hours, and a Zul&apos;Gurub instance ID will add 3 days to the instance lock time). An ID can be extended more than once. An extension can be reversed on an individual basis provided the player does not do anything in the instance during the extended instance lock period that would save that player to the instance. [/list] Emblem System Changes &lt;ul&gt; Both the 10 and 25-player instances of the Crusaders&apos; Coliseum drop a new Emblem of Triumph. Any dungeons that previously dropped Emblems of Heroism or Valor, such as Naxxramas or Heroic Halls of Stone, will now drop Emblems of Conquest instead. Emblems of Conquest can still be converted to Valor or Heroism. The Heroic dungeon daily quest will now reward 2 Emblems of Triumph and the normal daily dungeon quest will reward 1 Emblem of Conquest. The existing achievements to collect 1, 25, 50, etc. Emblems of Heroism, Valor, and Conquest have been converted to Feats of Strength since Heroism and Valor Emblems are no longer attainable. New achievements have been added to collect various amounts of any combination of emblems. [/list] 25-player raids will no longer be referred to as Heroic versions of a raid, as there is a new distinction between normal and Heroic modes for both 10 and 25 player versions of the Crusaders&apos; Coliseum. The Nexus: The Oculus &amp; The Eye of Eternity &lt;ul&gt; Drakes used by players in these instances will now scale in health and damage according to the rider&apos;s average item level. [/list] Ulduar &lt;ul&gt; Players can now use Blink, Shadowstep, and Demonic Teleport while participating in the illusion events in the Yogg-Saron encounter. Ominous Clouds in the Yogg-Saron encounter are now more vocal about touching players and should no longer sometimes appear to be in the wrong place for certain players. An Immortal Guardian targeted for Empowering Shadows in the Yogg-Saron encounter will now become a &apos;Marked Immortal Guardian&apos; while targeted. Crusher Tentacles in the Yogg-Saron encounter spawn a little slower in 25-player mode allowing a bit more time for players to clear out the Illusion room. Empowering Shadows in the Yogg-Saron encounter now targets a maximum of three Immortal Guardians in 25-player mode. Yogg-Saron&apos;s health has been reduced by 20% in the final stage of his 25-player mode. Winter Jormungars will no longer put everyone in the zone in combat when they emerge from a Snow Mound. Additionally, Snow Mounds will now disappear when all their jormungars have emerged. [/list] [/list] &lt;/p&gt; <br>
<br>
 Races: General &lt;ul&gt; Axe Specialization (Orc): The weapon bonus from this effect now applies to fist weapons in addition to axes. Tauren now have the option of changing skin tone by visiting the barber shop. [/list] &lt;/p&gt; <br>
<br>
 Items: General &lt;ul&gt; Agility: The amount of agility required per percentage of dodge has been increased by 15%. This change required recalibrating the amount of dodge a player has with 0 agility by a slight amount as well, so all players will see their dodge percentage vary a small amount. Block Value: The amount of bonus block value on all items has been doubled. This does not affect the base block value on shields or block value derived from strength. On-Use Block Value Items: All items and set bonuses that trigger temporary increases to block value have been modified. Instead of increasing their block value amount by 100% like other items, they have all had their effect durations doubled. This applies to Glyph of Deflection, Gnomeregan Autoblocker, Coren&apos;s Lucky Coin, Lavanthor&apos;s Talisman, Libram of Obstruction, Tome of the Lightbringer, Libram of the Sacred Shield, the tier-8 paladin Shield of Righteousness bonus, the tier-5 paladin Holy Shield bonus, and the tier-5 warrior Shield Block bonus. Dodge Rating: The amount of dodge rating required per percentage of dodge has been increased by 15%. This is before diminishing returns. Combined with other changes, this makes dodge rating and parry rating equally potent before diminishing returns apply. Item Buy Back Feature Revised &lt;ul&gt; The Item Buy Back time will now expire if the player enchants or sockets an item. Players will see a confirmation dialog box now when they attempt to enchant or add gems to an item giving them a last chance to reconsider. [/list] Items with Triggered Effects: These items generally have cooldowns on how often they can be triggered. Those cooldowns are now triggered each time the item is equipped (example: A trinket has a 45-second cooldown on an effect triggered by player attacks; when a player equips that item, the effect will be unable to be triggered for the first 45 seconds it is worn). Mounts &lt;ul&gt; The cast time for summoning any ground mount is now 1.5 seconds, down from 3 seconds. Apprentice Riding (Skill 75): Can now be learned at level 20 for 4 gold.

This is before diminishing returns. Combined with other changes, this makes dodge rating and parry rating equally potent before diminishing returns apply. Parry still diminishes more quickly than dodge. Resilience: No longer reduces the amount of damage done by damage-over-time spells, but instead reduces the amount of all damage done by players by the same proportion. In addition, the amount of resilience needed to reduce critical strike chance, critical strike damage and overall damage has been increased by 15%. [/list] &lt;/p&gt; <br>
<br>
 Classes: General &lt;ul&gt; All pets now receive 40% of their master&apos;s resilience and 100% of their master&apos;s spell penetration. In addition, if a player is at their appropriate spell hit chance or hit chance maximum, their pet will be at the maximum for spell hit chance, hit chance, and expertise. If they are below the maximum, their pet will be proportionately below those maximums. Replenishment: This buff now grants 1% of the target&apos;s maximum mana over 5 seconds instead of 0.25% per second. This applies to all 5 sources of Replenishment (Vampiric Touch, Judgements of the Wise, Hunting Party, Enduring Winter Frostbolts and Soul Leech). Silence, Strangulate, Silencing Shot, and Arcane Torrent: These abilities will also apply a 3-second Interrupt effect against non-player controlled targets, making them more versatile against creatures immune to silencing effects. [/list] &lt;/p&gt; <br>

It has also been moved one tier earlier in the tree and its spell effect has been made more transparent. Desolation: New talent. This talent is in the position formerly occupied by Desecration. It causes Blood Strikes to increase all damage the death knight deals by 1/2/3/4/5% for 12 seconds. Scourge Strike: Weapon damage bonus reduced to 40%, down from 45%. Damage increased by 10% per disease on the target, down from 11%. Summon Gargoyle: The gargoyle now flies lower to the ground, making it susceptible to melee attacks.

In addition, once every 2 minutes an attack that would have killed the paladin will fail to kill, and instead heal the paladin for up to 10/20/30% of maximum health depending on the paladin&apos;s defense rating (example: a paladin with defense equal to only 5 times his or her level will receive no healing from the talent, while a paladin who is immune to critical strikes from boss creatures through defense will receive the maximum amount). Guarded by the Light: This talent will no longer cause Divine Plea&apos;s duration to be refreshed by using Judgement of Wisdom, Judgement of Justice, or Judgement of Light. [/list] Retribution &lt;ul&gt; Art of War: Now only applies to melee critical hits, but will make your next Flash of Light or Exorcism instant.

These totems can be placed on the ground at once in one global cooldown for the combined mana cost of all 4 totems. The naming scheme of the spells to summon the different totem sets has been changed to make it less confusing for players: &lt;ul&gt; Call of Fire (Totem Bar 1, the first one gained at level 30) is now named Call of the Elements. Call of Water (Totem Bar 2) is now named Call of the Ancestors. Call of Air (Totem Bar 3) is now named Call of the Spirits. Call of Earth (the spell to recall all summoned totems) is now named Totemic Recall. [/list] All Shocks now have a default range of 25 yards, up from 20 yards. Base health increased by approximately 7% to correct for shamans having lower health than other classes. Chain Heal: Jump distance increased by 25% to 12.5 yards.
