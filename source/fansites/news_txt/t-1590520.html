Ashran Discovery<br>
An evolvution from timeless? allow a small quest chain to introduce people to what is happening and how to participate. I have been playing in ashran for over a week and am still confused by how bosses are summoned, or how one even creates that artifact. When asking in general, people either &quot;lol noob&quot; or dont answer. I dont like walking into a zone and having to be sherlock holmes.<br>
I&apos;m skeptical creating an &quot;informative quest&quot; or block of gossip text from an NPC for players to read will be effective. We&apos;ve been making efforts to make things more clear. For example, when the events become active they now have a clickable link in chat which you can read to see what the events do and what the rewards are. Similar to when you see a player cast a spell and you can click the spell tooltip in your combat log to see what exactly it does. We feel this is good design for &quot;learn as you play.&quot; We&apos;d love to hear any suggestions in this regard for helping newer players discover how Ashran works.

Justice and Valor Conversion<br>
When this change happens, will our valor points be converted to another currency?<br>
Apologies for the delay in getting back about this, but yes, Justice and Valor will be converted to gold. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/336192-valor-changes-in-60-item-upgrades-gone/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14059367017?page=7#139))<br>

PTR Character Copies<br>
The in-game Character Copy should now be working on PTR realms. You may need to restart your client in order to see your Account Data copy over, but once it does it&apos;s as easy as clicking the Copy button on the Character Selection Screen, and selecting the retail character you&apos;d like to copy over.

<br>
PTR Download Size<br>
Is it still possible to shortcut the download of PTR by copying the Data directory?<br>
It actually does this automatically by copying the raw data from your 5.4.8 retail install (if you have one). It means you only have to download ~8-10gb instead of a much larger size.

What would the point being to the &quot;Tank Squish&quot; Could you explain that a little bit more? #WarlordsQA<br>
Point is to bring down the power of both tanks and the creatures hitting them, so damage can be smoother; threatening but not... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507937761110667264))<br>
...two-shotting you. Important to note that we&apos;re not bringing things down so far that tanks are not needed, or their... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507937988056064000))<br>
...Active Mitigation gameplay changes. This is a numbers and tuning change, not a gameplay change. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507938112039698433))<br>
<br>
Basically, it&apos;s not a tank survival nerf, it&apos;s a non-tank survival buff?<br>
Ah, indeed, that is a somewhat appropriate way of looking at it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507309351145459712))<br>
<br>
will resource gen be changed as well?<br>
There are a couple changes involved that affect resource gen, but they&apos;re relatively minor. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507310585667518464))<br>
and is &quot;tankable mobs&quot; just a general term, or is there going to be a difference in how tankable and untankable mobs hit?<br>
We&apos;re going to reduce the damage of raid bosses more than outdoor world mobs, if that&apos;s what you mean. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507311923105239040))<br>
General idea: The harder it hits currently, the more we&apos;re going to reduce it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507311989589159937))<br>
<br>
Is the basic goal here to not have all non-tanks get destroyed so badly every time something touches them?<br>
Well, that&apos;s a minor part of it. The bigger part to us is to not have absurdly high numbers whenever tanks are involved, and... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507309717677285376))<br>
...start running into the extreme ends of scaling curves so early on. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507309864893157377))<br>
<br>
Concerned that there is less of a &apos;payoff&apos; for being a better tank versus a bad tank, mitigation wise?<br>
Tuning that is hard, but it&apos;s extremely important to us that we get that right. Tough to balance, especially on easier content. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507312810703855616))<br>
<br>
I want my tanking to be fun, active, and a little dangerous. AFK tanking is no fun.<br>
Perfect. Our goals align then. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507314528116158464))<br>
<br>
the most confusing thing in this was the armor for mail. I thought &quot;Uhh, what tank class wears mail at max?&quot;<br>
Basically, we brought Plate down to about where Mail was, and moved Mail down so it was still between Leather/Plate. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507315929622265857))<br>
<br>
Less Armor to Ret/DK/War but Cloth/Leather effects that make up for the less armor like Mage Armor, Shadowform, etc; No nerfs?<br>
In PvE, it hardly matters, and just makes them less better, but still better. In PvP, we&apos;re considering changes, but not.. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507334806275768321))<br>
...sure that they need any compensation in most cases. We need to see how it turns out in testing to evaluate. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507334947539914752))<br>
<br>
Whats the point of tanks if survivability is back in healers hands? It seems like tanks are going to have nothing to do now.<br>
That&apos;s a point that&apos;s a mile away, and we&apos;re taking a few steps toward. Gameplay will not change; Active Mitigation still strong. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507333034215886848))<br>
<br>
Is there any way you could clarify it at all, because from what I read it as we&apos;re getting &quot;nerfed&quot; because of PvP.<br>
No, these changes were not made for PvP reasons. Not sure what to clarify; this brings tanks&apos; tankiness down, but it&apos;s still ... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507337538118238208))<br>
...way way higher than non-tanks&apos; tankiness.DPS Tankiness = 100Old Tank Tankiness = 10000New Tank Tankiness = 5000 (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507337777386496000))<br>

What you think about Uplift healing 6 most injured targets and not depend on Rem anymore?being punished for bad rng is not cool.<br>
Uplift doesn&apos;t get reduced by full health targets. Also, many people lately are talking about the RNG, and exaggerating it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507948517029969920))<br>
*True* situation regarding randomness from two ReMs:1 player manually chosen ~10sec ago2 players who were injured ~10sec ago (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507948936204517376))<br>
1 player manually chosen just now2 players who are currently injuredThe vast majority of those need the healing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507949140488114176))<br>
People seem to be discussing it lately like it&apos;s purely random, or even 2/3 random. It&apos;s not. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507949421837824000))<br>

Please state the goal and gameplay elements (viability pve/pvp) behind gladiator&apos;s resolve talent.<br>
To be a sword-and-board style damage dealer. 100% viable DPS for both PvE and PvP. *Not* a tank if you&apos;re in Gladiator Stance. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507947144385277953))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Maybe you&apos;ve answered this already but will we need to gear through Heroic raiding in order to be geared for Mythic?<br>
You&apos;re certainly going to want to... it&apos;s no different than gearing in Normal Siege in order to work on Heroic Siege. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/507333381600710656))<br>
<br>
I see not a single heroic &quot;skull&quot; in the Mythic dungeon journal for Tectus. Is there no change other than increased damage?<br>
There are no Mythic-only abilities as such, but there&apos;s a pretty big difference in how the fight plays out.... (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/507430254471041024))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Is the blue gear given in strong boxes from skirmishes the lowest tier? Do you plan on leaving the drop rate, love it!<br>
There are two tiers: Normal and Veteran. The Normal gear drops pretty often. The Veteran drops rarely. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/507367768312664065))<br>
Separate from honor and conq gear correct? will the honor and conq be same i level as that gear respectively but with set bonuses?<br>
It is separate but the ilevels are similar. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/507369524631310336))<br>
<br>
the TR has always worked for Blizzcon qualifiers. Why not just use TR to avoid all this confusion?<br>
Yes and no. It worked because we didn&apos;t have a region-wide ladder in the past and needed to rank all of the players. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/507404970186915840))<br>
But players spent a lot of time gaming the ladder, avoiding competition whenever possible. Prefer people actually compete. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/507405190912167936))<br>
<br>
Hey holinka, any chance we&apos;ll see skirmishes after this arena season ends (prior to WoD)?<br>
They will be included with the 6.0 patch. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/507647731364425729))<br>
<br>
How much HP will a fullgeared lvl 100 have? <br>
About 250k in blues. We squished player health less than other things, so as to increase player survivability across the board. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/507939116781031424))<br>
<br>
any thought on giving a rating for skirmishes and bringing back team rating?<br>
Rating on skirmishes is contrary to the design goal. We have a hidden rating to help with matchmaking a little. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/507971088358203392))<br>
<br>
Hey! Why not add random seasons to bgs? Winter in AB (with snow storms!)... spring in AV. etc etc. Cosmetic, but fun....<br>
We&apos;re working towards that. It isn&apos;t as easy as you might think. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/508009939579576320))<br>

Don&apos;t judge a game by its cover! Iron Horde are the main villains, but there&apos;s a lot more to WoD than orcs. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/507731457112932352))<br>
<br>
I hear a lot of concerns regarding draenei in WoD. Guys, they have 2 zones, a dungeon, new art, tons of quests and characters. They&apos;re rad. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/507695379714826240))<br>
All we see from the marketing is Orcs orcs orcs. It&apos;s more than a little insulting we&apos;re not &quot;cool&quot; enough to be on the cover. :[<br>
And while they do suffer greatly at the hands of the Iron Horde, the draenei are also instrumental in opposing them. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/507731802480324609))<br>
