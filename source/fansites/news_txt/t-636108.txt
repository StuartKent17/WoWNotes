You probably noticed yesterday that I didn't post any weapon model screenshot, it took a bit longer than expected to get them done but I think it was definitely worth the wait. Below are most of the new weapon models added to the game for Ulduar Raid, for each model you will find most of the skin recolors available in the game files and it should be a fairly accurate preview of what you will see in game. Except maybe for a few bugged light effects on my side 

Note on Val'anyr, Gavel of Ancient Kings: According to its file name, the model of Val'anyr, Gavel of Ancient Kings  is here but actually looks even better in game. Just wait a few more hours and you will have a chance to see it in action
