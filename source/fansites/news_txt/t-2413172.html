Guild Pane Still Exists<br>
Some players have noticed that old guild pane features didn&apos;t make it to the community system. The old guild pane with features such as sorting by last online is still there, just type &quot;/guildroster&quot;. Thanks to Annaisha for the tip!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately there doesn&apos;t appear to be a way to use the old permissions system with more fine grained permissions, your only option now is the grouped permissions. This means you can&apos;t do things like allow members to edit their own notes anymore.<br>

Legion Companion App Change<br>
Thanks to DarthRigo (https://twitter.com/DarthRigo) who posted a thread on our forums (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2412920-Blizzard-broke-the-Wow-app-(intentionally)?p=49765173&amp;viewfull=1#post49765173) and tweeted BlizzardCS (https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS), we have learned that the switch characters button in the Legion Companion app was intentionally removed. It is now a little more involved to switch between your characters.<br>

Wargames in Battle for Azeroth<br>
Wargames aren&apos;t in the core UI, but you can type /wg to challenge the targeted player. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1095894-wargames-removed-in-bfa/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20765456758?page=1#3))<br>
<br>
Battle Chest and the &quot;New&quot; System<br>
The Battle Chest basically doesn&apos;t exist as a standalone purchase anymore.<br>
<br>
You make your Starter Edition, you add game time and then you immediately have access to all expansions up to, and including, Legion - no need to actually make a separate purchase of the Battle Chest anymore in order to upgrade the account. The only thing you would need to purchase separately is Battle for Azeroth.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, if a player wants to jump straight into the latest action on a new account - they can buy the Complete Collection which includes 30 days of game-time (so unlocking access to all previous expansions) and Battle for Azeroth (including the level 110 character boost).
