Things aren&apos;t really perfect right now, but Blizzard is working on it! <br>
We&#x2019;re excited to finally launch Warlords of Draenor and explore this new world with you, but we know that the experience has been less than ideal as we approach our first full day of launch. <br>
<br>
Europe was our first region to launch, and we encountered a few issues due to the sheer number of players attempting to enter Draenor from a single location. We worked to add multiple new ways to access Draenor, and this helped ease some of the initial rush into the new expansion as players were able to access it from their capital cities, as well as from the shrines in Pandaria.<br>
<br>
While that solution helped a ton for our North American launch, we ran into a few other issues, including a distributed denial of service attack, that resulted in increased latency.<br>
<br>
To help correct for this and other issues, we&#x2019;ve temporarily lowered maximum realm populations. This means there will be high queue times experienced on high-population realms. <br>
<br>
Here are some of the other important issues we&#x2019;re currently working to address:<br>
<br>
<br>
Instance servers timing out, which may impact dungeon access<br>
Continent server issues, which are resulting in Player Not Found and disconnection issues<br>
Garrison server issues, which are resulting in phasing and performance issues<br>
<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll post updates here as we make progress against these issues. Thank you for your zeal to face down the tyranny of the Iron Horde&#x2014;and for your continued patience as we work to improve the current experience.<br>

In attempts to pinpoint latency related issues we&#x2019;ve temporarily lowered the maximum number of people allowed in each realm. This will result in higher queue times as realms who have populations above the cap will not allow any new players in until it decreases back down below the new player cap. We&#x2019;re continuing work on this and other issues impacting game latency.</div></div>
