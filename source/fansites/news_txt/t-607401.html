M&apos;uru loot table update<br>
Not really a big update, but all the known loot for M&apos;uru have been added to Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/?latest=additions). Tooltips are now available. I also fixed the dead links in the original post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=7078.0)<br>

Kil&apos;jaeden information summary<br>
Can&apos;t really call it a preview, can&apos;t really call it speculation either, this post is here to summarize all the info we&apos;ve got about the last boss of Sunwell Plateau: Kil&apos;jaeden.<br>
<br>
Warning : You really shouldn&apos;t read this post if you don&apos;t want the fight spoiled. <br>
<br>
Loot table<br>
This is probably the most accurate information we&apos;ve got about Kil&apos;jaeden for the moment, even if the drops aren&apos;t confirmed yet (obviously), the ilvl and itemIDs of these item confirm their drop location. <br>

Dialogue transcript and spells<br>
That&apos;s probably the only decent resource we&apos;ve got about the fight itself. It looks like the fight will have a lot of phases and cutscenes involving the players, Kil&apos;jaeden, Kalecgos (http://www.wowwiki.com/Kalecgos), and Anveena (http://www.wowwiki.com/Anveena). It&apos;s not really hard to guess what will become of Anveena after reading the dialogues and checking the spells.<br>
<br>
Anveena (WoWWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Anveena))<br>
Anveena\ANVEENAAWAKE01.wav - Kalec ? Kalec ?!<br>

First &quot;real&quot; screenshot of Kil&apos;jaeden ?<br>
This screenshot was sent during the late phases of patch 2.4 testing on PTRs. According to the sender this is a leaked screenshot from a GM, I still can&apos;t fully confirm it&apos;s legit but it definitely looked good enough to be posted. Keep in mind that it could be a fake, it wasn&apos;t that hard to run 2.4 emulated server a few weeks ago, even if none of them was public. <br>

<br>
Encounter bugs<br>
Two bugs are already listed in the GM Petition tool in game, they confirm that players will have to use &quot;Shield Orbs&quot; during the encounter (see Kalecgos dialogue). The 2nd bug is a bigger problem and it could be hard to make any decent progress on the fight until the bug is fixed (most likely in 2.4.2)<br>

<br>
<br>
When will we be able to fight him ?<br>
Raids need the last door unlocked to be able to fight him, the door to M&apos;uru was only unlocked a week ago and it wouldn&apos;t be surprising if Blizzard wanted to deploy the Patch 2.4.2 on live servers to fix some of the bugs in the encounter before making it available to players. <br>
<br>
I wouldn&apos;t expect it before a few weeks, probably after the release of patch 2.4.2 (and it could be as soon as tomorrow ... or next week). Don&apos;t forget, that&apos;s pure speculation and nothing is confirmed by Blizzard. <br>
