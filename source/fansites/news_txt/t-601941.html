Thyvene (a french Community Representative) posted something very interesting for enchanters. I don&apos;t expect you to read french so here is the translation. <br>
<br>
The developers plan to give to enchanters the possibility to sell their enchantments at the auction house, however this shouldn&apos;t be implemented into the game before the next expansion, Wrath of the Lich King<br>

Item changes in 2.2<br>
As you probably all know, a lot of item changes were made during the last PTR patches. I thought it might be a good idea to list all the 2.2 item changes for all the people who wants to know if their equipment will get changed. (If some of them are still missing please post in comments)<br>
