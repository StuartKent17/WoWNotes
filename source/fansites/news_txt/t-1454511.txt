Warlords of Draenor - Upcoming Artcraft Post: Garrisons
It looks like the next Artcraft  won't be featuring another character model, but Garrison models!


 

The level of detail we're approaching with Warlords of Draenor means that these are going to be some-of-if-not-the-best looking sets, props and buildings ever seen in the World of Warcraft. Creating just one set of buildings for each faction as well as their individual upgrades is a huge amount of work, and they rely on most of the same artistic resources as the expansion's dungeons, raids, quest hubs, and cities. Creating any additional buildings would quite literally translate to less content for those other parts of the game. We are incorporating some elements of other races into the individual Garrison buildings, but the themes are largely of Durotar and Elwynn. We'll be offering a sneak peek at the Garrison buildings in the next Artcraft, which is currently slated to be posted next Tuesday--written by the art team and formatted by moi--so be sure to keep an eye on the front page next week.

Not at release but do you think eventually we might be able to buy racial specific themes later sometime? Or is this design set in stone? I loved the way Lotro did their housing, each race got their own theme for housing.
Certainly there will be updates and changes as the expansion progresses, but I don't believe there's any current intention to add full sets of additional buildings. If we were to work on those for an expansion patch it would quite literally come at the cost of a raid tier. That is where that work would come from. We have to make decisions on how to spend our time.

I think if the Garrison becomes a long-term persistent feature there's certainly a possibility for larger additions, but we're focusing on it being a feature for Warlords of Draenor as your fortress against the Iron Horde. I think we'll have to see how it goes.

This is actually something we hope to implement. Would appreciate any feedback you have about it. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Character Customization
The game isn't built to support variation of height or weight. It's not likely to happen either as it would effect the way armor is scaled to characters.
That's a good point. 

Just for fun, if you could pick your top three character customization options, in order of preference, what would they be? For me:

1. Scars/tattoos/warpaint
2. More facial hair options for males
3. Racial 'variants' for those who have them

These would make a lot of people very happy...
Perhaps. One of the things that's tricky about customization options is that, as fun as they are, so much of a character's visuals are expressed via armor, weapons, and abilities. We spend comparatively little time seeing a character's face up close.

Don't get me wrong. I like them, and I always carefully make each character just so. I personally feel that a personalized character increases my personal connection to it. Still, it's a hard argument to ignore. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 


Blue Tweets
Character / Items
Is it intended that Kor'kron Spire of Supremacy  has 108 more secondaries than Trident of Corrupted Water  same 580 ilvl
Yes. Skewing the stats more into one of them costs more of the budget. Celestalon 
Single stat items from ToT Bracers of the Midnight Comet  a counter example of this policy? Thought it wasnt a thing since mop
Those we give the full effect of the split to, so that they're not supremely suboptimal. Celestalon 

I was wondering if you got my tweet about adding immerseus trinket to MW table loot? 
It's not intended for them. A bug allows it to work for them, but we decided to leave it so we don't hurt existing owners. Celestalon 
speaking of trinkets, any reason behind no agi amp trink? using a str one as a BrM is a weird choice & its bis in normal w/o WF
I'd be suspicious of whatever theorycraft found it to be optimal to use that. Celestalon 
I guess that brings up the discussion. is the AMP effect worth ditching your proc.
Commonly forgotten: Amp increases crit damage, not crit chance. So won't increase Elusive Brew uptime. Celestalon 

Warlords of Draenor Stats
Is the item squish only to solve combat system problems with big numbers or are you using it to retune the ilvl power curve too?
Both. Celestalon 

In 6.0, Will we do MoP raids as we can do now with lich raids?I said that because it is going to be 10 levels of difference.
In WoD, MoP raids will be similar in difficulty to how Cata raids are now in MoP. Celestalon 
I would think the squish would leave them a lil harder.
.The squish *will not* make old content harder. Really. Celestalon 
will old raids become easier? Ex: cata content will be as hard as wrath is today. Or will difficulty stay the same as today?
Leveling up and higher level gear will make old raids easier. Celestalon 

Hit rating is gone. Hit mechanics are staying for >3 levels. Miss chance debuffs gone from encounters / mobs too?
Sorry, I don't understand the question... Do you mean the occasional hit chance debuff like Putricide's Choking Gas? Unchanged. Celestalon 
I meant 'will they ever be used in future encounters again'. I can't remember any since Wrath.
It's a tool in our toolbox that we use from time to time, but not often. Potentially in the future, yes. Not common though. Celestalon 

With reforging gone, will stat weights be balanced a bit more, so some gear isn't so terrible for certain specs?
Yes. Celestalon 

New secondary stats are meh, 1 guy who gets lucky will always have a raid spot even if the other guy is better cause more dps.
Misconception. There are no significant changes to how much luck impacts gear and then DPS in a raiding guild. Celestalon 

PvE
Will 6.0 boss mechanics regarding tanks be more dynamic and creative than current ones? Like changing how we play, tank, I dunno
We want to have significantly less time that you're taking turns tanking, and doing nothing in between. Celestalon 
But does that mean more "multi-bosses" like Fallen Protectors, add spawns like Blackfuse or something entirely new?
Not any one specific thing, just much less time doing nothing but DPSing. Celestalon 
if you keep using quick taunt swaps, should review immunity timer. seeing "immune" during garrosh sucks.
Agreed. Celestalon 

PvP
an we stop drinking in arena please, you can't drink half way though a raid boss so you shouldnt be able to drink in arena
Drinking in arena has been around a long time. Not sure what the reaction would be if removed I'm guessing mixed holinka 
not a big fan of precedence arguments in game design. Either it adds fun and depth or it doesn’t.
In a 9 year old game, precedence does matter. People have a lot of attachment to "how things are" and change can be quite jarring. holinka 
counter argument is lack of change creates boredom. Talents are a good ex of how systems need a fresh look regardless of history
Certainly. Don't disagree that change has to happen, but it doesn't mean we should ignore history. It's one more thing to balance. holinka 

More details on CC revamps, talent revamps, honour changes, tertiary stats in PvP, and so on.
We are writing one about CC changes. Not sure when it will be released, but prefer it comes out before you see a list of changes. holinka 

does the 1000 rating floor count for RBGs, too?
Yes holinka 

Do you think changing crits to 150% is good? I feel 200% makes them worth it, having big hits are what makes crit fun..
It means we have to tune damage and resilience around those numbers which makes sustained damage feel like nothing holinka 

RBGs need to be removed, you can't split the PvP community anymore,Qs are longer than the time we spent inside a BG.
RBGs have little to no impact on random BG queue times. holinka 

Do you think ret needs some passive defense, like 10-15% dmg reduction or cata sacred shield ? It feel very squishy for a melee atm
They have a major glyph that provides just that holinka 

big fan of the original Alterac Valley, days long matches and all! Will Ashran have the same variety of objectives? 1/2
That's the plan. We want to pepper a lot of stuff throughout the zone. holinka 

Professions
Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask, but for WoD, can we Archaeologists expect new digsites on Draenor too?
Yes. Celestalon
