Prepare for the Dungeon

Once inside the scenario, you cannot leave or you’ll have to start over.
The scenario is somewhat time-consuming, so be prepared to spend at least a half hour inside.
You will be going against various pet types in this dungeon, so bring a variety of pets to counter them. For bosses, you will want to have Undead, Elemental, Mechanical and Dragon pets.
Bring at least two Dragon pets for the final boss, Cookie’s Leftovers http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119407-cookies-leftovers, due to his Magic type and Stun ability.



Getting to the Dungeon

Visit Breanni http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/96479-breanni’s Magical Menagerie in Dalaran http://www.wowdb.com/zones/7502-dalaran Broken Isles and speak with Breanni http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/96479-breanni.
Pick up Deadmines, Part Three? http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/46293-deadmines-part-three and head to Moonbrook in Westfall http://ptr.wowdb.com/zones/40-westfall to find Marcus “Bagman” Brown.
Alliance players can take the Stormwind http://www.wowdb.com/zones/1519-stormwind-city portal from Dalaran and fly over.
Horde players can take the Karazhan portal from Dalaran and fly over.
Once you’ve arrived in Moonbrook, talk to Marcus “Bagman” Brown behind the stables next to the meeting stone and accept The Deadmines Strike Back http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/46291-the-deadmines-strike-back.
Speak with him again to be teleported into the scenario. You will not be able to start the scenario by zoning in to the Deadmines.

Dungeon Stages

Each non-Boss battle will require you to defeat three pets.
The Primary pet will always be accompanied by two Common-quality pets randomly selected from these three pets:

Deadmines Parrot http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119756-deadmines-parrot Flying, Common
Ironclad Crab http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119760-ironclad-crab Aquatic, Common
Deadmines Rat http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119754-deadmines-rat Critter, Common




Stage 1 - Defeat Junk Reaper 500 http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119409-junk-reaper-500 Mechanical, Epic, Boss

Elemental pets like Phoenix Hatchling http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/26119-phoenix-hatchling are enough to take him down.



Stage 2 - Defeat Unfortunate Defias http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119346-unfortunate-defias Undead, Uncommon, Elite, Angry Geode http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119342-angry-geode Elemental, Uncommon, Elite and their teams.


Stage 3 - Defeat Mining Monkey http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119341-mining-monkey Beast, Rare, Elite and his team.

Mechanical pets like Darkmoon Tonk http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/55356-darkmoon-tonk will make quick work of this guy.
He has an ability that boosts his damage that he follows with a two-turn setup attack, but he should go down by the time he finishes the combo.



Stage 4- Defeat “Captain” Klutz http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119408-captain-klutz Humanoid, Epic, Boss

As one of the harder bosses in the dungeon, he has an ability that heals him for a good amount while boosting his damage for two turns.
Additionally, he heals every time he does damage since he is a Humanoid.
Using a zerg strat like two mechanical pets with the Explode ability to start and then ending with an Undead pet for the attack advantage is a good way to burst him down.



Stage 5 - Defeat Klutz’s Battle Rat http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119343-klutzs-battle-rat Critter, Uncommon, Elite, Klutz’s Battle Monkey http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119345-klutzs-battle-monkey Beast, Uncommon, Elite, Klutz’s Battle Bird http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119344-klutzs-battle-bird Flying, Uncommon, Elite and their teams.


Stage 6 - Talk to the Shadowy Figure on top of the ship.


Stage 7 - Defeat Cookie’s Leftovers http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119407-cookies-leftovers Magic, Legendary, Boss

He has an ability that stuns your pet for 2 turns. He starts out with the ability and uses it when it's off cooldown, so switch out when it happens.
His other two abilities are a Leech attack and a regular attack that seem to have a two-turn cooldown each since he uses both attacks then passes his turn and begins the rotation again with the stun.
Dragon pets like Emerald Proto-Whelp http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/68850-emerald-proto-whelp are good for this battle since they do more damage to Magic pets, which can help cancel out his healing.
Have two Dragon pets so you can switch between them when he stuns.



Once you defeat Cookie’s Leftovers http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119407-cookies-leftovers, return to Marcus “Bagman” Brown to turn in the quest and receive your reward.

Patch Notes
Opinion Poll!We try to give dev notes on complex, non-obvious, or large impact changes. But for simple tuning, we usually don't. 1/3 Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/857335192645545984
I commonly see "Can you explain your reasoning for nerfing X?", but never for similar buffs. Obviously, getting nerfed sucks, but... 2/3 Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/857335464000331776
...there's often nothing complex/interesting to it. Answer'd usually be "It was simply overpowered." Should we say that? Alternative? 3/3 Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/857335863386136576
I think the problem is after something is OP you nerf it to the ground, making it almost unplayable.
Do we? We try not to. It's easy to perceive as such, though, and I can empathize. It's *extremely* rare that we ever intentionally overnerf. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/857337810373574656
Clarify everything even if it seems obvious. The more transparent you are with your changes and reasons the better for everyone.
Assume that including dev notes at all has a time cost that could be spent elsewhere, working on other important changes Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/857336285748383744
Unless it costs me a Raid Tier I'm ok with this.
What if it costs you changes to your spec, so that someone else's spec can get a "It was 5% high, so we nerfed it by 5%" post? Still? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/857337052186071040


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
For games that support the trinity Tank, Healer, DPS, why does it always seem that DPS is always in low demand compared to Tanks or Healers? Is it because being DPS is something players naturally gravitate to, or because games still haven’t found a way for tanking and healing to be more fun?
I think tanking or healing are plenty fun, and those are almost exclusively the roles I tend to play especially in WoW, which is probably what I played the most.

I think DPS is kind of low risk, high reward, in that it’s pretty satisfying but if you screw up, it’s usually not super painful. Yes there are DPS checks, but it’s often hard to isolate one person as being the reason you didn’t clear that bar. Tanking and healing are more high risk, moderate reward. If you do your job right, then that kind of feels like table stakes, and if you do them wrong, everyone notices and might yell at you. As DPS, you can sometimes zone out or even AFK. Everyone knows if you AFK as a tank. You have to always be “on.”

Dealing damage also feels like the core way to play those games, because that’s you have to do when solo, and it even feels like the core way to play most games. Link has a sword. Samus has a ranged weapon. Mario jumps on dudes. I think we all just grow up as DPS as a default and then migrate into other roles.

I have often wondered what would happen to WoW if dungeons were 6-players tank, healer, 4 DPS and raids were similarly scaled up. Would the ratios just naturally work out better, or would the population slowly shift and there would still be too many DPS?
