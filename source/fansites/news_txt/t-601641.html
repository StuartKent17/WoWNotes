The source is fairly reliable and I&apos;d say it&apos;s 80% accurate. <br>
<br>
Wrath of the Lich King<br>
The level cap at Blizzcon will be set to 72 (It will be 80 at the release, of course)<br>
Utgarde Keep should be one of the first dungeon you can access, and the first wing will be playable at Blizzcon.<br>
Horde players will be able to access Northrend by taking a Zeppelin in Tirisfal Glades, they will arrive at Vengeance Landing in Howling Fjord. (This wasn&apos;t mentionned, but we can assume that Alliance players will arrive at Valgarde)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Zul&apos;aman<br>
The reset timer should be 3 days. <br>
Loots will have pretty much the same quality as Tier 5 loots.</div></div>
