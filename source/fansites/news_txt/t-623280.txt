Wrath of the Lich King - Talent Calculator
The Talent Calculator  has been updated for the launch of Wrath of the Lich King ! 

The interface looks a bit nicer, most of the text links have been replaced by nice buttons
Glyphs are now included in the template! Now that all the Glyphs are available in game it makes sense to add them to the calculator.
Tons of new bugs have been added for your enjoyment. We'll fix them throughout the night but just like anything I launch it wasn't tested intensively before going live, the first 10 people who report bugs in comments are getting a hug.
Just like the old talent calculator, it's not supposed to be compatible with IE6 and you will have to upgrade your browser and make thousands of webmaster happy by doing it

Already known bugs include funny behavior of glyph tooltips clicking will always work, your mouse cursor/item tooltip might just not update, you can report everything else.
