Female Worgen Preview Pictures<br>
Blizzard just released a couple of screenshots of the ... female worgen! That&apos;s not really what I asked for my birthday (yes, it is!) but I guess that works. <br>
<br>
Important - These models are a work in progress and they might not reflect the final appearance of female worgens in game. <br>

US PTR Testing Schedule<br>
The US PTR is testing again tomorrow.<br>
Now that the 3.3.5 patch is available for PTR testing, we wanted to have a round of focus testing for Ruby Sanctum. Only normal mode will be available, with Heroic testing to occur at a later date. <br>
<br>
Everything related to this zone is implemented for this test, please note any issues with the trash creatures and sub-bosses, loot, achievements, and quests. <br>
<br>
US Testing Schedule: <br>
Thursday, May 20 starting at 19:00 EDT. <br>
<br>
We plan to allow testing for an extended period. However since this is the Test Realm, unforeseen issues could delay or cancel testing at any time.</div></div>
