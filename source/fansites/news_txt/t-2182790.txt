Adjustments to Legendary Items in 7.2
In an upcoming PTR patch, you will see adjustments to a number of legendary items. These changes can be categorized into:


Added throughput effects to legendaries with non-throughput bonuses, or only occasional throughput benefits.

Example: Promise of Elune, the Moon Goddess Balance Druid boots that grant a utility healing effect via casting Lunar Strike/Solar Wrath, will now also increase the damage of Lunar Strike and Solar Wrath by 8%.

Added extra secondary stats to non-throughput legendaries where that makes more sense than to add throughput to the legendary effect itself.

Example: Belo'vir's Final Stand Mage chest that causes Blink to grant an absorb shield now have an extra 3rd secondary stat. We don’t want to turn Blink into a rotational DPS button, so instead of adding an effect like “Blink also increases your damage dealt by X% for Y sec”, we’re adding an extra ~650 secondary stats to the item.

Improvements to legendaries whose design isn’t working well in gameplay.

This has been and will continue to be an ongoing effort, and we’ll be making such changes as time goes on, including after Patch 7.2.

Numbers tuning to bring the throughput benefits of other legendaries more in line with each other.

This has been and will also continue to be an ongoing effort.

Legendaries have different use cases and we want their power level to be tuned with that in mind. Universal throughput legendaries - legendaries that increase output in most situations - should be good but not always the best in every situation. Situational throughput legendaries – legendaries that perform very well in the right situation - should be better than universal throughput legendaries in those situations, but then aren’t ideal in other situations. Non-throughput legendaries will soon include a small amount of consistent output through either an adjustment to their legendary effect or an extra 3rd secondary stat, and continue to provide their utility benefits.

By narrowing the power gap between throughput legendaries and non-throughput legendaries, we’re hopeful that 1 the first two legendaries a character acquires will have some reliable throughput increase and 2 once you acquire more of them, you’ll feel more freedom to swap them around based on the situation.


Patch 7.2 - Flying Achievement Change
The Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Two http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11446-broken-isles-pathfinder-part-two achievement was changed on the PTR. 
Thanks for the feedback, everyone! The original currency requirement for Nethershards in this quest was temporary until final Nethershard costs and drop rates were determined. The current requirement for this quest is 2500 Nethershards. Also, *spoiler* Khadgar realizes that he was a bit overzealous and at the conclusion of the quest determines he only needs 1. So the player is left with the remaining 2499 to use as they please.

Additionally, some folks are worried that the Legionfall Campaign is going to stop them from flying. It's not! The campaign is not a requirement to unlock flying in 7.2. One of the early versions of the achievement had that as a requirement, but it has since been removed.

Can we see EXACTLY what is in the amended achievement.
You can see this on the PTR right now. It looks like the datamining sites are a bit out of date though.

1. Part 1 completed
2. Explore Broken Shore - Go to every POI
3. Defender of the Broken Isles - Complete Demon Assault incl. scenario in each of the 4 zones that have them
4. Reach Revered Rep with Legionfall faction.


Patch 7.2 - Glorious Tyranny Visual Change
The Glorious Tyranny http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/120286-enchanters-illusion-glorious-tyranny enchant has been changed in Patch 7.2. You can see an example of the change on a smaller and larger weapon below. 


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/thumb/enchantChange01.jpg http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/enchantChange01.jpg http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/thumb/enchantChange02.jpg http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/enchantChange02.jpg 

When we made the Glorious Tyranny enchant during the Mists of Pandaria expansion, we went for maximum cool looks. Unfortunately, the result has proved to be negative for computer performance.

Our artists regularly make performance improvement passes on things like this, and this particular enchant visual is one of their priorities for Patch 7.2. They're doing what's necessary to improve performance when this enchant is active, but as you can see, the look has changed a bit.

We’re trying here to balance helping players who are having issues and restoring the original appearance, but ultimately there's going to have to be a small change in how it looks.


Live Developer Q&A – Submit Your Questions

Patch 7.2 PTR - Flying Testing NPC Disabled Next Build
Just wanted to give a quick heads up that, with the next PTR build, we'll be removing Petey Yar the test NPC that granted the achievements required for 7.2 flying from Dalaran, and implementing the intended requirements to activate the Class Mount quests.

So, if you want to do any additional testing/experimenting with 7.2 Flying or Class Mounts, you have until the next PTR update to do so!


Build of the Month - March 2017
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

All of the parts on this page are Amazon affiliate links. When you purchase your parts through them it helps support the site!

This month
The current SSD prices http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/ssdgraph.gif are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale.

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L7UZMAK?ie=UTF8&tag=mmochamp-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00L7UZMAK. 

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 7700K and would get more performance from spending that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx and Nvidia http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us drivers up to date.

Don't forget to visit the Computer Forum http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/290-Computer for any extra questions!
