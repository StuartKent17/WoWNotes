We had a few words with Nymh (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek%27thar&amp;n=Nymh), the first player in the world to reach level 80 in Wrath of the Lich King. <br>

<br>
MMO-Champion: Hello Nymh, and congratulations for your level 80 ! Could you tell us a bit more about yourself ? <br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Nymh: I play a warlock named Nymh (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek%27thar&amp;n=Nymh) on the french server Drek&apos;thar. I used to be the guild leader of Harmonie, a french top PvE guild who was among the first 10 guilds to kill Kil&apos;jaeden in France, but we eventually decided to merge with the 2nd guild of our server. The result is Genesis, which was originally an pre-BC high level guild. In real life I&apos;m 21 and currently employed, I took a few days of vacation for the release of the expansion. <br>
<br>
MMO-Champion: You reached the max level 27 hours after the european servers went online, that&apos;s pretty fast even if you spend all your time leveling ... Could you tell us how you achieved that ? <br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Nymh: The idea first came up when I saw this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=16919.0) from Jynxx (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Turalyon&amp;n=Jynxx). The idea looked nice and I decided to run a few tests on beta servers. It took about 3 hours to level from 78 to 79 and considering that it was one of the longest level, it seemed good enough to use this strategy to powerlevel at the release. <br>
<br>
The biggest problem was to find a spot with enough monsters to grind without too much downtime ... I spent some time on beta servers and eventually found the crypt in Drakil&apos;ji Ruins (Grizzly Hills), I think that&apos;s one of the only place in Wrath of the Lich King where monsters repop in about 30 seconds, mobs here are also neutral and it makes grinding a little safer. <br>

<br>
I also had to optimize my downtimes and decided to level with a healer out of party, Pavelomm (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek&apos;Thar&amp;n=Pavelomm) was nice enough to spend the last 27 hours healing me without taking any XP and he obviously played a huge role in the process. <br>
<br>
When I reached level 76 I realized that my leveling speed was slightly lower than what I experienced in beta, I decided to change the template from the original post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=16919.0) and switched to something with 2 points in Shadow Mastery to make my DoTs stronger and the leveling a bit easier. (It usually takes 2 DoTs to kill a monster)<br>
<br>
MMO-Champion: The first level 80 was supposed to be Darus, a paladin who did some powerleveling in instances with Athene and a few other people and eventually got suspended by Blizzard at level 79. (and reseted to level 70 a few hours later) Did you hear about him ?<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Nymh: Yeah I had a few people monitoring other servers to give me updates about the situation here, I don&apos;t really know how Darus did that but I assume it will be hotfixed by Blizzard very soon. <br>
<br>
MMO-Champion: Is there anyone you want to thank ? <br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Nymh: Sure ! There are a bunch of people who helped a lot with my leveling. <br>
<br>
Pavelomm (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek&apos;Thar&amp;n=Pavelomm) was nice enough to stay with me for the last 27 hours and managed to keep me alive for all this time!<br>
Pratax (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek&apos;Thar&amp;n=Pratax) originally planned to level with me but couldn&apos;t be here due to last minute work obligations, he helped me a lot during beta when I was planning everything. <br>
Ardanell (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek&apos;Thar&amp;n=Ardanell) / Bro (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek&apos;Thar&amp;n=Bro) / Zhazha (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek&apos;Thar&amp;n=Zhazha) were nice enough to run all the way to Grizzly Hills to teleport me to Ironforge and let me train my new spells without wasting too much time. <br>
Coralie, who was nice enough to buy me the game 2 days ago! <br>
<br>
And of course, the whole Genesis (http://www.guilde-genesis.org/) guild and all the players from Drek&apos;thar-EU!</div></div>
