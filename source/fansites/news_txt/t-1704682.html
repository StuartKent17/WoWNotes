<br>
General<br>
<br>
[Hotfix in testing] Mangle&apos;s damage has increased by 27%.<br>
<br>
<br>
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br>
<br>
Blackrock Foundry<br>
<br>
Gruul<br>
<br>
Gruul now uses Petrifying Slam against 5 targets in a 10-player raid, scaling up to 10 targets in a 30-player raid (used to be 8 targets for all raid sizes).<br>
<br>
<br>
Hans&apos;gar &amp; Franzok<br>
<br>
Fixed an issue that could cause Beastlord Darmac to despawn immediately once defeated.<br>
Mages should no longer be able to incorrectly Blink through the ramp at the end of the room.<br>
<br>
<br>
Beastlord Darmac<br>
<br>
Fixed an issue that could cause Beastlord Darmac despawn immediately once defeated.<br>
<br>
<br>
Operator Thogar<br>
<br>
Operator Thogar should now be immune to damage during the start of the encounter until he jumps down onto the tracks.<br>
<br>
<br>
Iron Maidens<br>
<br>
Admiral Gar&apos;an should no longer interrupt herself while using Deploy Turret.<br>
<br>
<br>
Blackhand<br>
<br>
Players should no longer be able to avoid Incendiary Shot on the balconies in Stage Two.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Blackrock Foundry: Clarification/Known Issues<br>
Over the course of Blackrock Foundry&#x2019;s testing, we&#x2019;ve made a handful of changes to encounter mechanics that are not currently being communicated in the Dungeon Journal. The Dungeon Journal will be updated with those changes in Patch 6.1, which is currently on the PTR, but we&apos;d like to share those changes to minimize confusion.<br>
<br>
Changes to the encounters that are already live, but not in the Dungeon Journal:<br>
<br>
On The Blast Furnace encounter, Slag Pool is used on all difficulties; but the journal currently incorrectly suggests that it is Mythic only. In 6.1 the journal will accurately reflect that Slag Pool affects the Heart of the Mountain during Phase 2. Hans&#x2019;gar and Franzok&#x2019;s Crippling Suplex ability no longer deals damage based on maximum health of the tank who was picked up. It deals a flat amount of Physical damage to both tanks who are thrown together. (663,500 damage on Raid Finder, 862,550 damage on Normal, 1,127,950 damage on Heroic, and 1,327,000 damage on Mythic) Gruul will instantly regain 50 Rage if his Inferno Slice fails to hit at least 4 targets on Mythic difficulty. Blackhand will regain energy after using Massive Shattering Smash if it fails to hit at least 4 targets. <br>
<br>
<br>
Known issues that will be fixed in Patch 6.1:<br>
<br>
When grabbed by Hans&#x2019;gar or Franzok in advance of Crippling Suplex, tanks are currently unable to use abilities. They will be able to use abilities while grabbed in 6.1. Flamebender Ka&#x2019;graz&#x2019;s Singe debuff currently appears as a dispellable magic debuff on unit frames. It is not intended to be dispellable; this display issue will be fixed in 6.1.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: Added an additional note for Slag Pool during The Blast Furnace encounter.<br>

Transmog Guidelines<br>
For some reason Blizzard has a firm stance on what we can and cannot transmog.<br>
We just want there to be some kind of order to how characters in the game look. Even with the current restrictions you can do some pretty crazy stuff, but that doesn&apos;t mean it should necessarily be anything goes. And it&apos;s a big new(ish) system with potentially far reaching consequences if we&apos;re not careful. At least to start. We&apos;ve pretty frequently made changes to the rules to allow more transmog options, and that&apos;s likely to continue. Over a slightly longer term we think there should be a more defined system around transmog, with more defined paths of gameplay to specific options and looks. It&apos;s not news it&apos;s something we&apos;ve been working on, and we&apos;re continuing to work on it.

Inappropriate use of Swapblaster<br>
Can&apos;t you just use the item that makes you immune for 12 hours? It costs like 40 silver on the AH.<br>
In upcoming Patch 6.1, Neural Silencer (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109599-neural-silencer) will also make players immune to the effects of Swapblaster (http://www.wowdb.com/items/111820-swapblaster).

Tarren Mill vs Southshore and Hogs<br>
It&apos;s old data. The &quot;Hogs&quot; mini-Hogger pet is not a reward from that achievement, and we&apos;ll correct it in the next PTR build. We haven&apos;t determined yet if/when he&apos;ll be obtainable, or from what source.

and not to be obtuse, I can&apos;t find any mention of Strength = Parry in the game anywhere. How would one know this?<br>
We covered a lot of the changes back in October, 2014: http://t.co/WCAwNw6Lwv Great info here that should help clarify. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/558682371927461889))<br>
<br>
How come Mind Control still randomly DC&apos;s the Priest sometimes? Is it something that just can&apos;t be fixed or is there more to it? This bug has been in the game for several years now and it has been pointed out numerous times if I recall correctly.<br>
Difficult to reproduce internally on one of the most complex spells in the game. Tried to fix multiple times. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/558698565925486592))<br>

versatility do not affecting recuperate healing right now. is this a bug or intended behavior? #bugs<br>
This is intended. Heals based on % health do not benefit from effects that increase healing, including Versatility. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/558443115594252288))<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; the Venom Rush talent. Would you please clarify how Combat is intended to use this talent on boss mobs?<br>
Not needed. Instant Poison already counts for Venom Rush. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/558801184002031616))<br>
Does this &quot;hidden&quot; poisoned debuff last as long as other poisons do? (12 secs). I noticed on twin ogrons while not using &gt;&gt;<br>
Same duration, yep. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/558808333956571136))<br>

ty for patch notes - what about chaos bolt doing chaos dmg for 6.1 yes?<br>
can I ask, why are you guys on this chaos bolt doing chaos dmg campaign? What do you think will be gained? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/558836994348810240))<br>
firstly flavour. Chaos as a dmg type exists, CB should do it. Secondly, chaos dmg interacts differently with certain...<br>
Chaos damage just counteds the target&apos;s lowest resist. Nobody has any resist since Mists, so no gain. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/558951502094409729))<br>
Additionally, getting interrupted while casting a Chaos school spell will lock out *all* schools. It&apos;d be a nerf. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/558951637113245697))<br>
the lockout thing is worth the pierce, but raises another issue. So hard to cast, diff interr. behaviour maybe?<br>
What pierce? There&apos;s nothing to pierce anymore. Hasn&apos;t been since Mists. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/559091170479833088))<br>

PvP<br>
Hi! Is WoD Season1 going to end with 6.1 or there is no link between these two &quot;events&quot;? (or &quot;dunno yet&quot; ? )<br>
Season 1 does not end with Patch 6.1. Keep an eye on our website for the official announcement! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/558443401977151489))<br>
<br>
In 6.1, will you allow guild raid groups of 40 to queue into Ashran with the new changes?<br>
Yes. If a member of your raid queues for Ashran, all other members of that raid will queue up for the same Ashran. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/558449744226160641))<br>
<br>
by far the worse experience when gearing up alts for pvp... Grinding honor in questing gear... It&apos;s 2015...any changes maybe?<br>
sorry i disagree. We boost your ilevel to 650, drop 660 gear like rain and are super generous with honor. Never been easier. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/558681476972048384))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
Short question to garrison raid missions. Can you get both a BRF and HM mission or will there only be one at a time?<br>
You will have a chance to get both at the same time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/558441325532413952))<br>
<br>
Will there be a way to trade in follower 615 tokens for other tokens? Even if just 3 point upgrade tokens?<br>
No plans for that at the moment, but we definitely appreciate the suggestion. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/558441599865065473))<br>
<br>
why do monks get a salvage yard transmog they cant actually transmog...whats the point?<br>
The items are invisible and we don&#x2019;t allow transmog to invisible items at this time. We included them for completeness. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/558445648836444161))<br>
<br>
Concerning: Class Xmog sets from Salvage. Why bother adding them to the game at all if some parts can&apos;t be xmogged? (Esp monk)<br>

<br>
Misc<br>
Any word on broken Ashran achieves and the Sea Calf pet bug? It&apos;s been months, and have asked numerous times to no avail.<br>
These are both being investigated and we hope to have them addressed in Patch 6.1. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/558444626072186880))<br>
