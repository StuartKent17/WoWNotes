Cory Stockton interview on Buffed.de - Patch 4.2 Extra Information<br>
We&apos;re finally bathing in tons of delicious Patch 4.2 information and the latest update comes from an interview of Cory Stockton on Buffed.de (http://www.buffed.de/World-of-Warcraft-PC-16678/Specials/WoW-Patch-42-Epische-Quest-Reihe-Feuerland-Bosse-und-mehr-Lead-Content-Designer-Cory-Stockton-im-Interview-zu-Patch-42-822077/)! <br>
<br>
List mostly built from the translation posted by Samin on our forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/894673-4.2-New-Information?p=11247718). <br>
<br>
Firelands Raid:<br>
<br>
The raid instance is supposed to be 4 times the size of Obsidian Sanctum, roughly the size of Alterac Valley<br>
All the bosses will have new models<br>
Ground mounts will be allowed.<br>
The first four bosses will be non-linear before you get to the final three that are in a linear fashion, with Ragnaros at the end. <br>
Ragnaros will be the final boss. It will NOT be an heroic-only encounter like Sinestra but the heroic version will be completely different from the normal one and developers wanted to make sure it feels really unique and pretty hardcore. <br>
There will be more bars/meters to make it easier to watch certain mechanics in contrast to a simple debuff stacking<br>
You won&apos;t need fire resistance and bosses won&apos;t have any either. <br>
There will be epic recipies drops for all the usual professions. <br>
<br>
<br>
Tier 12 Armor Sets<br>
<br>
All T12 sets will be fire themed (duh)<br>
Not new but reminder: Warlock will be themed after those awesome looking fire spiders<br>
One plate set will be themed after the new fire giants (Anthricyst maybe?), the shoulders will be like the fire giant&apos;s face.<br>
Set bonus will be firelands themed too and may resemble certain boss abilities<br>
<br>
<br>
Raid Misc.<br>
<br>
There will be a new Baradin Hold boss - another loot pinata (his words!)<br>
The interviewer also asked for a second raid dungeon, Cory ignored that part and only answered the Baradin Hold part - interpret yourself.<br>
<br>
<br>
Legendary:<br>
<br>
The proc of the weapon will be offensive and not suited for healers<br>
Weapon will be forged in major cities (Stormwind and Orgrimmar respectively)<br>
There will be a &apos;very long&apos; event with a lot of voice acting and the Blue Dragonflight.<br>
Your guild will get a reward if you complete the achievement for the Legendary staff. It will most likely be a pet, it will have an unique look (not necessarily fiery) and a &quot;legendary&quot; feel. <br>
Both 10 &amp; 25 are supposed to get the weapon roughly at the same pace<br>
25M will have s small advantage of getting the profession related parts done quicker<br>
Nothing more on what profession related parts of the legendary are but it will be only a minor part of the progression to the legendary, focus is on raiding.<br>
<br>
<br>
Encounter Journal (i.e. boss guides):<br>
<br>
Will be on PTR<br>
Will not require unlocking by killing the boss or something<br>
They start with entries for Cataclysm content only but plan to add WotLK, TBC and vanilla entries too - later<br>
There will be no loot wishlist but they have plans for that. Loot will be listed for encounters and sorted by difficulty.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quests:<br>
<br>
There will be a new epic level 85 questline around Thrall<br>
It&apos;s not revealed if that is about Thrall (maybe) becoming the new aspect of earth<br>
No epics as reward, story is the reward<br>
This new questline can be completed entirely in solo.<br>
New Daily quests will be &quot;modular&quot; i.e. you start with a base set of quests and earn a currency as reward. With this currency you can unlock other quest hubs and decide how you unlock all of the dailies. This will be acompanied by heavy phasing.<br>
Phasing will only change the area, you will still be able to play with your friends even if they have progressed further<br>
There will be new gear, cosmetic rewards, and mounts. <br>
