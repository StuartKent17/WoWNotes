Learning time about Blizzard Community teams! There&apos;s a difference between Community Managers and Forum Moderators.<br>
<br>
CMs are part of the regional Community teams, and are generally here as a representative to and from the development team, etc.<br>
<br>
Forum Moderators are part of our Customer Support team, and are generally here to moderate the forums, delete threads, edit posts, etc.<br>
<br>
Just for some clarity: I&apos;m the Community Manager for WoW in North America - and there are a number of moderators in the shadows at all times, just like our in-game GMs!<br>
<br>
From the CM side: You may occasionally see Lore or Kaivax popping in and out, especially on the PTR and Class Development forums, as they are handling some more broad-scope, less region-specific Community operations now. And I have Aeridel and Rythmor assisting me here on the forums if I&apos;m ever out of the office, but they handle Social Media and Relationships, respectively, as their main functions. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20757667239?page=1#11))<br>
