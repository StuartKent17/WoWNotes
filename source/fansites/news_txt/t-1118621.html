BattleTags Now Live...ish!<br>
The Diablo III beta is now connected to the live version of Battle.net. If you are in the Diablo III beta, or your friends are in the Diablo III beta, you are able to add them to your friends list via Battletag in Diablo III. Once they are added, they will appear on your friends list in WoW, allowing you to take part in cross-realm activities together. You can even add your friend&apos;s other friends by BattleTag (when they are BattleTag friends and not RealID friends with the player).<br>
<br>
If you want to take advantage of this, be sure to add your friends before May 1, when the Diablo III beta ends (http://www.diablofans.com/blizz-tracker/topic/220928-the-diablo-iii-beta-draws-to-a-close/). If you don&apos;t, you will be stuck waiting until May 15 when Diablo III is released to add any new friends. There is no word yet on when we will be able to add people in WoW directly by BattleTag.<br>

Horde Pandaren Introduction<br>
After leveling a new Pandaren character the player must choose a faction to leave The Wandering Isle. After selecting a faction you meet with the faction leader to learn a little bit more about the faction. <br>

WoWDB Pet Pages Update<br>
Work continues at a steady pace on WoWDB, with the addition of more information for Pets after the changes in the last Beta build. We now have fixed the dedicated pages for all of the Battle Pet abilities and added more information to each pet&apos;s page. <br>
<br>

<br>
The tooltips for individual (http://www.wowdb.com/pet-abilities/169-deep-breath) abilities (http://www.wowdb.com/pet-abilities/230-cleansing-rain) will show you which pets the attack is strong against, and which pets the attack is weak against. The page will also show you which pets can learn the abilities. On each pet&apos;s page (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/23811-jubling), we have listed all of the spells that the pet can learn. We will continue to add features as the system is fully implemented in the beta.<br>

Patch 4.3.4 64-bit Client<br>
If you are having trouble getting the Launcher to work correctly with Patch 4.3.4, don&apos;t forget to delete the following files if you have the 64-bit client installed: Battle.net-64.dll, MovieProxy.exe, WoW-64.exe. <br>
A 64-bit client is once again available for use with Patch 4.3.4. Before being able to launch WoW in 64-bit mode you will need to download the 64-bit client for PC/Mac (using one of the links below), and unzip it into your World of Warcraft directory. Once you extract the files you can start the 64-bit client by opening the Launcher as normal (Run as Administrator if applicable). To switch back to the 32-bit client, go into Options -&gt; Game Preferences, and check the Launch 32-bit client setting. The game will display which version you are using at the bottom left hand corner of the login screen. ex: Version 4.3.4 (15595) (Release x64)<br>
<br>
Build 4.3.4.15595 - Windows (http://us.media.battle.net.edgesuite.net/downloads/wow-installers/live/WoWLive-64-Win-15595.zip) - Mac (http://us.media.battle.net.edgesuite.net/downloads/wow-installers/live/WoWLive-64-Mac-15595.zip)<br>

Next wave of Mists beta invites?<br>
As soon as we&apos;re ready to invite more people to test the beta, we&apos;ll let you know as we have with previous waves. <br>
<br>
It just wouldn&apos;t be very helpful if we made an advanced warning announcement that an advanced warning announcement will be coming soon. &apos;Cause then people would be asking for hints as to when the warning about the warning is coming. Pretty soon they&apos;ll want clues about the hints about the warning warning to come before the announced announcement.It&apos;s not a good idea to look at it that way since we&apos;re not sticking to an invite schedule. We invite large chunks of Annual Pass holders, then we give it a while to monitor realm stability and population. Each wave of invites has a varied impact on the beta test. We can&apos;t know in advance how many of the people invited will start playing right away (if at all), or how often they&apos;ll all play, etc.<br>
<br>
Once things start to stabilize after invites are sent out and we see more predictable statistics, we&apos;ll set up another wave and start inviting more people. It isn&apos;t an exact science, which also means it&apos;s not very feasible for us to be transparent about every step of the process between waves of invites being sent.<br>
<br>
There are a few simple goals with beta:<br>
<br>
- Get plenty of people testing all the new content/features so we get solid feedback, as well as address bugs and crashes<br>
<br>
- Get the remaining Annual Pass holders in as quickly as possible so they&apos;re given what they&apos;ve been guaranteed<br>
<br>
- Make sure the environment is stable enough that we can accomplish the first two goals<br>
<br>
Having said all of that, I just want to try and drive the point home that you&apos;ll virtually never get an adequate answer when you ask us when another wave of beta invites will be going out. The community team will be notified once the developers and producers are prepared to invite more people. We get the messaging together, localize it as needed, and post as soon as we get the green light. There&apos;s virtually no point in that process where publicly providing estimates on when the next wave is coming will be useful, as that whole process generally happens within a matter of hours (not days or weeks).<br>
<br>
Aside from being unable to get everyone into the beta myself, I hope this info helps a bit. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/221053-next-wave-of-mists-beta-invites/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4489049500?page=11#218))<br>

Battle.net&#xAE; Update: Updated Terms of Use<br>
In preparation for the upcoming launch of Diablo&#xAE; III, we&#x2019;ve updated the Battle.net&#xAE; Terms of Use to cover some key changes that will be occurring prior to the game&#x2019;s release.<br>
<br>
New Battle.net Balance Limits and Security Requirements: With the upcoming release of Diablo III&#x2019;s currency-based auction house, account security will become more important than ever; we are making a few changes to ensure that players who wish to use the auction house have a safe and worry-free experience. Beginning prior to the launch of Diablo III, in order to carry a Battle.net Balance greater than $100 USD (or equivalent), players will be required to attach a Battle.net Authenticator or Battle.net Mobile Authenticator to their Battle.net account. In addition, we will be instituting a Battle.net Balance maximum limit of $250 USD (or equivalent). We&#x2019;ll go into more detail about the different options for making purchases in the currency-based auction house prior to launch.<br>
<br>
Global Play: When Diablo III presales began, we mentioned as part of the purchase process that Diablo III players would be able to choose to play on game servers based in the Americas, Europe, or Asia, regardless of what region they were connecting from or which language-version of the game they purchased (with certain restrictions). As you&#x2019;ll see in the updated TOU, the name for this functionality is &#x201C;Global Play,&#x201D; and we&#x2019;ll be providing more information about exactly how it works, including the restrictions noted above, prior to Diablo III&#x2019;s launch.<br>
<br>
Stay tuned to diablo3.com for further details on the currency-based auction house and Global Play in the coming weeks.
