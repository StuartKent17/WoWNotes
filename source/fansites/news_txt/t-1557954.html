Miscellaneous<br>
<br>

Ability Consolidation and Refinement<br>
<br>
Thick Hide (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/16931) has been removed and its effects have been incorporated into Bear Form (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5487) for Guardian Druids.<br>
<br>
Bear Form (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5487) now increases armor by 600% 330% for all Druid specializations, and no longer increases Haste and Critical Strike from items by 50%, but instead causes Haste to reduce the global cooldown<br>
For Guardian Druids, Bear Form (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5487) now also reduces magical damage taken by 25%, reduces physical damage taken by 12%, reduces chance to be critically hit by 6%, and reduces chance for attacks to be parried by 3%.<br>
<br>
Tiger&#x2019;s Fury is now usable during Berserk (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/106952).<br>
<br>
<br>
Summary of changes to Balance:<br>
That&apos;s the basics of the new Moonkin rotation. There&#x2019;s room for improvement beyond that, learning to optimally maintain both periodic damage effects while maximizing their damage with the strongest Eclipse (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/79577) effect, timing Starsurge (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78674) to optimize the benefit of its buff, make use of Starfall (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/48505) and Hurricane (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/42231) for area damage, and taking advantage of the strengths of each side (such as Moonfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921) and Sunfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402) having significant differences now). Here are the full details of the changes.<br>
<br>
Details of changes to Balance:<br>
<br>
Eclipse (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/79577) has been redesigned.<br>
<br>
The damage of damage-over-time effects changes dynamically as Eclipse (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/79577) changes.<br>
<br>
Moonfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921) now has a base duration of 20 seconds (up from 14 seconds), but is no longer extended by Starfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/2912) and Starsurge (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78674) critical strikes. Upon reaching 100 Lunar Energy, the next Moonfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921) deals 100% additional initial damage.<br>
Sunfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402) is no longer its own spell and replaces Moonfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921) on the action bar whenever Balance Energy is on the Solar side. Sunfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402) now has a base duration of 24 20 seconds (up from 14 seconds), but is no longer extended by Wrath (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5176) and Starsurge (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78674) critical strikes. Enemies may still suffer from both Moonfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921) and Sunfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402)&#x2019;s periodic damage components simultaneously. Upon reaching 100 Solar Energy, the next Sunfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402) deals 100% additional initial damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
Restoration Changes<br>
<br>
Omen of Clarity (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/113043) (Restoration) can now only be triggered by the most recently applied Lifebloom (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/94447), and now causes the next Regrowth (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8936) to be free.<br>
<br>

Talent Revisions<br>
<br>
Ice Ward (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/111264) was changed to make it more competitive with the rest of its talent row. Ice Ward (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/111264) now causes the next 3 attackers (up from 1) to trigger a Frost Nova (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/122).<br>
<br>
<br>
One of the most problematic Talent rows in the game has been the Mage level-90 row. The primary theme of the row was mana, which only Arcane Mages actually cared about. Bonus damage was added in, making it functional for all Mages, but muddled in its goals. Additionally, some of them just weren&apos;t fun to play with. We&apos;ve revised the row to be purely about damage, and made them have less maintenance cost. Arcane Mages will have enough mana regeneration without these Talents to perform well.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mirror Image (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/55342) is now a level-90 Talent, replacing Invocation (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/114003). Mirror Image (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/55342) now inherit 100% 50% of the Mage&#x2019;s Spell Power (up from 5%), last 40 seconds (up from 30 seconds), and have a 2 minutes cooldown (down from 3 minutes).<br>
<br>
<br>

Ability Consolidation and Refinement<br>
There were a few mergers of passive abilities, and some tweaks to a couple of abilities.<br>
<br>
Redemption (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/7328)&#x2019;s mana cost has been reduced by 95%.<br>
Selfless Healer (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/85804) no longer causes Bastion of Glory to apply to Flash Heal (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/2061).<br>
<br>
<br>
Protection Changes<br>
For Protection, we tweaked Eternal Flame (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/114163) in order to reduce its massive self-healing amount, and provide better balance between talents on that row. We also added a new passive, Shining Protector, in order to give defensive value to the new Multistrike stat. Holy Wrath (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/119072)&#x2019;s damage and cooldown were also increased, and Sanctified Wrath (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/53376) changed to buff it further, in order to give Protection Paladins more burst threat and damage, while retaining its core damage-splitting identity.<br>
<br>
<br>
Holy Wrath (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/119072)&#x2019;s damage has been increased by 100%, and its cooldown increased to 15 seconds (up from 9 seconds).<br>
Sanctified Wrath (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/53376) for Protection Paladins has been redesigned.<br>
<br>
Sanctified Wrath (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/53376) (Protection) now increases the damage of Holy Wrath (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/119072) by 100% and causes it to generate 1 Holy Power.<br>
<br>
<br>

Demonology Changes<br>
We were unsatisfied with Grimoire of Sacrifice (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/108503) for Demonology. Fundamentally, it did not fit Demonology&#x2019;s theme to sacrifice their pet, full time. We had toyed with ideas where it acted as a temporary cooldown for Demonology, but have decided to replace it with a new talent, which is more theme-appropriate, and fits well against the competition in that talent row.<br>
<br>
<br>
Grimoire of Sacrifice (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/108503) is no longer available to Demonology Warlocks and has a new talent, Grimoire of Synergy in its place.<br>
<br>
Grimoire of Synergy: When the Warlock or their demon deals damage, there is a chance to trigger Demonic Synergy, granting the other one 15% increased damage for 15 seconds.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior <br>
Ability Consolidation and Refinement<br>
<br>
Thunder Clap (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/115799) now costs 15 30 Rage, and also reduces the movement speed of nearby enemies by 50% for 6 sec.<br>
Ultimatum (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/122509)&#x2019;s effects have been merged into baseline Shield Slam (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/23922).<br>
<br>
<br>
Fury Changes<br>
Fury Warriors received a few additional changes. In particular, Heroic Strike (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78) has been removed for Fury Warriors, and modified Wild Strike (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/100130) to fill the role of quick excess Rage dump. We also made a revision to the Critical Strike chance of Bloodthirst (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/23881) to make them less crit-dependant. A new glyph has been added which gives Fury Warriors a choice for a notably different playstyle. Auto attack damage had become too high, so we also moved some damage from that into Execute (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5308) (which has been changed to deal damage based on Weapon Damage, instead of just Attack Power). In order to make sure that you&#x2019;re able to spend all of your resources within each Colossus Smash (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/86346) window, we added an extension to it onto Raging Blow (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/96103). Plus, we&apos;ve updated some to spell alerts to improve usability.<br>
<br>
<br>
Raging Blow (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/96103) now extends the duration of Colossus Smash (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/86346) by 2 seconds, and has a spell alert on the left and right slots.</div></div>
