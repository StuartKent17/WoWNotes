Yay ! Weekend ! Slow news day. ! But still, not that bad

2.1.0
Endarion was nice enough to send a new screenshot with more new weapons. Actually i'm not sure if all of them are new, but the 4 maces on the left are the Paladin "tier 5" reward, and the pink one at the top is a new Black Temple loot introduced in the last PTR update.

Nice news of the week

Still looking for people to contribute with boss strategies. Use the contact link on the left if you're interested, or PM me. 
I'll start updating some page to reflect 2.1.0 changes soon.
I fixed the boss strategies pages, it should look better for Internet Explorer users. 
I realized that the news still had a scrolling bar for Internet Explorer users, I'll make sure it won't happen in the future.
Seriously, get Firefox. http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/
