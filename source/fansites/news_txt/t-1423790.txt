Warcraft Movie Cast Announcement
Legendary announced  that Daniel Wu  and Clancy Brown  will also be joining the Warcraft movie cast. Daniel Wu recently appeared in Europa Report and Clancy Brown regularly appears in and does voices for TV shows. It isn't his first time working on a Warcraft project though, as he was Thrall  in the cancelled Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans  game.

Warlords of Draenor Music
Is there going to be any new music in WoD? I find it surprising that nobody has asked this question. I love the music in the game and wondering if they've kept up to the scale and quality of previous expansions. 
As always, you can expect some new music in the expansion. I couldn't answer as to how much yet, but if you look back over the years, you'll see that we've added many hours of music on a fairly consistent basis. Also, being able to see the Draenei and Karabor in a new light should be illuminating to the auditory system. We'll do what we can to provide any sneak listens or insights we can along the path to the release of the expansion. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Warlords of Draenor Timeline
I guess im bothered that actions in this past, wont affect present day. it's considered "separate".
Iron Horde orcs are pouring through the Dark Portal into your home. It will absolutely be affecting your present day... and you were just starting to make a sandwich. Jerks. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Legendary Cloak Effort
The point of this thread is to state.... this is by far the most complcated time consuming Legendary ever in this game.
Hah, well thanks for laying it out visually. I think we like how it worked out in essence, ultimately having something for even the LFR player to work toward over a long period of time is a great goal to have for people. Definitely a lot of lessons learned on how we can make steps feel less grindy, and maybe make the experience more cohesive. But having that kind of Legendary doesn't necessarily preclude us from also having a Legendary that's maybe class specific and more of a personal challenge like Fangs, or something like the Warlock green fire quest. We don't think it necessarily has to be one or the other. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Character / Items
That's an answer to a different question. Currently spirit does nothing for mage, but something for SPriest.
We allowed the Shadow conversion in a weak moment, but they had alternatives. Balance and Elemental did not. Source 

Why the sweeping itemization changes for WoD? Lack of Agi/Str on secondary pieces halves the power.
So we double the amount of attack power on an item? That's an easy tweak, not a reason to dislike the system IMO. Source 
AGI also increases crit. Without AGI on 1/3 of equipment this a major loss in effectiveness.
Or we could just boost crit chance. Again, these seem to be easily solved details and not a reason to reject the design. Source 

Unsure you're best to ask this, but: Will all of Draenor be explorable achievement-wise at expansion launch? Or not til 6.1?
All at launch. Is this related to flying? Source 

So since healer armour will be shared with dps, will the "Bonus" random stats affect healers too? Multistrike, cleave, etc.
Yes. Source 
is the cleave stat going to affect healers and the way they heal?
The idea is it could heal nearby targets like the SoO trinket. Source 

Simple question. Will secondary stats be random on gear in WoD too? Chest of Awesome always has haste + mastery off 1st boss?
For a raid boss drop, the secondary stats will likely be the same every time. May not be the case of other sources of loot. Source 

Are Dodge and Parry getting rolled into Armor specifically as a stat?
No. Tanks will have a fixed amount of dodge and parry, perhaps with CDs or procs that buff it temporarily. Source
