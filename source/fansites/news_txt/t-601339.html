Method (http://smiler.se/method/portal/) killed Kael&apos;thas for the first time tonight, despite the fact that they&apos;re nice ... why would you care ?<br>
Easy, they dropped the Ashes of Al&apos;ar, the phoenix mount is now confirmed to be a drop from Kael&apos;thas. <br>

Itemstats<br>
If you checked Method (http://smiler.se/method/portal/) website, you&apos;ll notice that they&apos;re using itemstats, which is a nice module for EQDkp and tons of PHP Portal to show item tooltips.<br>
Good news for all the itemstats users (and I&apos;m sure there are many of them), a Wowhead parser (http://forums.eqdkp.com/index.php?showtopic=9342) is now available, it&apos;s still a beta but it seems to work fine for most of the people who tried it. <br>

Website<br>
Xavalia posted a Sha&apos;tari Skyguards Reputation Guide (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=253.0) on the forums, check it, it&apos;s nice. <br>
I&apos;m done updating most of the item pages with the new (1 month old-new) item tooltips, only the consumables and the jewelcraft list aren&apos;t updated yet and should be updated soon. You probably don&apos;t care but this update alone explain why I didn&apos;t release new content in the past weeks, had to change a few thousand itemID on the site. Basically, it means more interesting update, soon.</div></div>
