If you&apos;re using Avast 4.8 as an antivirus (and a lot of players probably do), the latest update might cause keyboard problems while playing World of Warcraft. Most of the time you will experience a &quot;keyboard lag&quot;, after pushing a key the game will only react 2 or 3 seconds later. <br>
There was some mention on the French forums about Avast 4.8, there was an update released this week that for some seems to be causing problems.<br>
<br>
<br>
WoWHead updated with new features<br>
During the last week, Wowhead has been updated with a bunch of new features.<br>
<br>
The Wowhead model viewer (http://www.wowhead.com/?help=modelviewer) has now been updated! You can now view 3d models for armor pieces (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=940), item sets (http://www.wowhead.com/?itemset=217) and humanoid NPCs (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=4949)! You can even change the race and gender you want them displayed on, and the model viewer will remember what you selected.<br>
<br>
In addition to the added support for character models, the following improvements have been made to the model viewer:<br>
<br>
Both Versions<br>
Added model bones to support placement of weapons/armor.<br>
Moved from COLLADA format to a custom binary model format for faster loading times.<br>
NPC models set to an animated, cooler-looking pose.<br>
Added anti-aliasing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Flash<br>
Motion blur effect when spinning models<br>
Texture softening<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Java<br>
Viewport sized to fit<br>
Sprite tinting<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Any bugs related to the model viewer should be reported here.<br>
<br>
Next up, Wowhead now supports quest tooltips (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=9123)! All sites that are Powered by Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/?powered) will automatically have this same feature added.<br>
<br>
Also, Wowhead is very excited to announce the addition of a brand new feature--NPC Ability Listings (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=24976#abilities). The Wowhead Client (http://www.wowhead.com/?client) now automatically gathers data on the abilities that NPCs use, and automatically uploads it to Wowhead. Finally a use for all of those Uncategorized Spells!<br>
