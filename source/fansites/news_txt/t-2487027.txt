Greetings Beta Testers,

Starting on the afternoon of May 24, we will be enabling the PvP Honor System and the Warsong Gulch Battleground in the WoW Classic Beta realms. Beta players are invited to queue for Warsong Gulch from 12:00 p.m. PDT to 4:00 p.m. PDT on Saturday, May 25 and Sunday, May 26 as we try to spin up as many instances of the battleground as possible. While we’re targeting that timeframe to help capture data, players who are logged into the beta will be able to queue for Warsong Gulch at the Warsong Gulch battlemaster in capital cities at any time throughout the weekend.

As a reminder, queuing for Warsong Gulch requires your character to be level 10 or higher.

We have a few known issues related to Warsong Gulch:


The Battleground Scoreboard does not currently display Flag Captures and Flag Return statistics.
The Battleground Scoreboard stat numbers are misaligned with player names.


Have fun racking up those HKs and don’t forget to submit any bugs or issues that you encounter using the in-game bug reporter.
