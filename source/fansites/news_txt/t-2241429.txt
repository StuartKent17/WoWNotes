The Midsummer Fire Festival is back, bringing new bonfires and achievements, a downright irresponsible toy, and an elemental pet that will keep you warm on those long, dark nights of your campaign against the Burning Legion.

What’s New?
Wrath of the Frost Lord—If you’re over level 60 and have battled Frost Lord Ahune in recent years, you may have noticed he’s been feeling a little weak and sorry for himself. To make things interesting, this year we prescribed bed rest until the festival and helped him out with a power boost. He’s feeling much, much better. Unfortunately for you.

Feel the Burn—This year, there’s a new toy for you to misbehave with: a Set of Matches. The toy is available from your familiar, fair-of-face, friendly, flirty, Fire Festival vendors for 50 Burning Blossoms. Try saying that after too much Fiery Festival Brew. When you purchase the toy, we highly recommend you find a Kevlar jacket and an isolated spot for your first go. For reasons.

An Elemental Friend—You can also get your hopefully gloved hands on a new pet: the Igneous Flameling. This cute elemental has a set of skills that will light up your pet battles. It boasts Burn, Conflagrate, Flame Breath, and…actually, we couldn’t get close enough to complete our research. All we know is you’re gonna need a bigger pet cage. And we need new eyebrows.

Praise the Fire!—Last but not least, the Flame Wardens have constructed additional bonfires! New bonfires have been lit across Draenor and the Broken Isles. Search them out to honor or desecrate, and get the new achievement attached to both. The PvP in you will need to be strong, as capital city bonfires become battlefields for faction pride. Who said you can’t fight fire with fire?

Man your bonfires, champions! The heat is on!

Mythic+ not awarding Writing Essence, bug?
This is not a bug. Source https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/877605483405651968

Is it intended that Writhing Essences don't roll over when handing in the quest? I just handed it in at 55 and now have 0.
Yes, this is intended. This is due to a limitation of how quests function. We agree it isn’t an ideal design, and are investigating possible improvements. Source https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/877617825292079104

Feral Druid Feedback/Suggestions - 7.2.5
Something that's on our radar is how constrained the rotation is with both Jagged Wounds and Savage Roar. The lowest-priority finisher Ferocious Bite gets pushed out too much with the combination of those two talents, which also currently happen to be too favored for DPS purposes. Both of those talents likely have too much of an impact on the pacing of the spec's rotation for what a talent should do. In both cases we should probably reduce the talent's impact on pacing that is, on GCD/resource usage and either A increase its DPS in some pacing-neutral fashion, or B let the talent value sink if it's currently dominating its row, and counterbuff the spec some other way.

This is a broader issue that we've started looking at more often since 7.0, when the number and complexity of spec-specific rotation-modifying talents/bonuses increased dramatically. Problems like having too many or too few open GCDs, or resource starvation/flooding, spring up a lot more often when 5 rows of talents + legendaries/traits can be potentially moved in and out of the same rotation. And because talents already have a tuning constraint they need to be DPS-balanced within their row, the pacing effect can't always be easily tuned on its own. I'd expect a more common trend of talents having a simple added effect that boosts DPS so the talent can be tuned without introducing an overly large pacing swing seen already with many recent redesigns: Soul of the Forest, Legacy of the Void, Boulderfist, Reverse Entropy, and so forth.
