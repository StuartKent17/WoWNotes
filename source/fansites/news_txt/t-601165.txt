We have pushed a hot fix which corrected an issue in Caverns of Time: Escape from Durholde Keep, where Thrall would on rare occasions give incorrect text and halt the progress of the instance. 


Website
The "image viewer" used to show full screen sized pictures on various sections of the website has been definitely removed. 
Zangarmarsh , Terokkar Forest , Nagrand , Blade's Edge Mountains , Netherstorm , and Shadowmoon Valley  moneymaking pages have been changed a bit, the summary at the top of each page now show the items you can farm instead of the name of the zone. 
Armor Showroom  links now open in new window when you try to look for a NPC information. 



RSS
Just a reminder, the new RSS feed is available here ;action=.xml;board=2.0;sa=news;. The old one will keep warning you of comments posted on each news.

IRC
Reminder #2, the official channel of the website is #mmo-champion on irc.quakenet.org
