Addon Review: GTFO
GTFO  is an addon that will be useful to anyone who does PvE, especially those of you that play with Spell Detail level turned down. It will warn you when you are standing in something that you shouldn't be, even in content from Vanilla to Firelands. The alert is just audio currently, but it does expand functionality when used with a few other addons. If you play with sounds off, it can unmute sounds to give you the alert as well. 

The warnings come in four different categories, including High/Low for damage amounts, Failure for when you stood in the fire for too long, and Friendly Fire for when you need to get away from someone in the raid who is doing damage to you.

It has the option to turn off the alert for easy content and integrates with Recount   to save statistics and see who is failing the most. The damage amounts will not be fully accurate in all cases, but the counters should be.


 

It also works with Power Auras Classic  to provide a visual indicator when you are standing in something! Adding this alert just takes a few steps that are clearly outlined on the download page. Doing "/gtfo test", "/gtfo test2", "/gtfo test3", "/gtfo test4" will let you trigger a test of the damage alerts to ensure the volume and graphic are working as you intended. 


 

Be sure that you don't use LUI with it, as there are some incompatibility issues in the current version. If you are already using it you need to remove the Recount data from your WTF folder for each character. "/gtfo options" will get you right into the options screen. Give it a try  and let us know what you think!
