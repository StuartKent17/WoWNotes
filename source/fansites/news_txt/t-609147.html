With the original news (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=9138.0) reaching more than 1500 comments, I&apos;ll assume that a lot of people are interested in the teaser currently running on official sites, here is a little explanation for all of you who don&apos;t understand what&apos;s happening. <br>
<br>

<br>
The splash screen<br>
This is the most obvious part of the teaser, a huge picture of a block of ice slowly cracking to reveal what seems to be a face. Each day a rune was added to the ice.<br>
Day 1 - The first rune looks a lot like the one found on the Lich King swords in many official artworks. <br>
Day 2 - The 2nd rune is the Hel Rune from Diablo 2<br>
Day 3 - The 3rd rune is the Protoss Symbol found on the Starcraft 2 official site (http://www.starcraft2.com/features/)<br>
Day 4 - The 4th rune hasn&apos;t been identified yet, and what looks like the eyes of the lich king appeared in the center of the ice crack. <br>

<br>
The &quot;hidden&quot; artwork<br>
If you check the CSS File (http://us.media.blizzard.com/232309/master.css) of the page, you&apos;ll notice a few commented lines pointing to image links. <br>
<br>
/*.tundra {background:url(_images/04.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br>
/*.cold {background:url(_images/16.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br>
/*.cavern {background:url(_images/15.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br>
/*.icy {background:url(_images/23.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br>
<br>
There was a few theories about these pictures, people tried to replace the number of each pictures with letter to see if it would form &quot;Diablo&quot; in the end but it didn&apos;t work. Obviously there are many links between &quot;icy&quot;, &quot;tundra&quot;, &quot;cavern&quot;, &quot;cold&quot;, and Wrath of the Lich King / Diablo 2 and we can&apos;t confirm anything based on these names. <br>

Conclusion<br>
Blizzard is having fun and posts a few things from each one of their game just to keep people interested and you&apos;ll just have to wait for the WWI to get the final answer. (You&apos;ve been waiting for Diablo 3 for years, it&apos;s not like 2 more days will kill you right ?)</div></div>
