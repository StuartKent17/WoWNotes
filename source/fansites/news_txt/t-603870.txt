More server testing, while the game servers are down, why don't you try to download Tales of the Past III http://northrend.mmo-champion.com/media/talesofthepast.wmv ? WCM Link http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=53953

Server test #1
The US servers are down but the PTRs are still up, it looks like a good time to run some tests on the servers, the PTR Patches are now available on direct download doesn't include the latest build. Might add something ... slightly bigger if the server doesn't get killed.

New servers
The site is now hosted on new servers, however there are still a few issues with them and it might be a little slow for some of you, we're working to have it resolved as soon as possible and it should be much better very soon. Please report any bug you might find in comments I mean, new bugs, not the ones that have been sitting on the site for months ^^. Thanks for your patience.


The fireball is a lie
Sorry mages, no christmas for you. New ranks of Fireball and Frostbolts on PTRs are definitely a mistake.
This is not a bug, it's a mistake made when creating the pre-mades. The spells are not sufficiently different then the rank 13 versions so we will not be making updates to the templates to remove them.


Screenshot and Dessert contest
Cooking is nice, it gives stamina and funny buffs and it works out of the game ! I'm pretty sure that all the cooking shows you've been watching during the past months will be useful now. 
It's that time of year when all of Azeroth celebrates Winter Veil. The snowballs are flying and so are the reindeer. To help everyone get into the spirit, we are running two holiday contests!

The Royal Photographic Society of Azeroth has begun looking for the best depictions of holiday celebrations in the World of Warcraft, so keep your eyes open for good screenshot opportunities.

It's also time to show off your culinary skills. We're looking for your cakes, candies, cookies, and gingerbread houses of your best Warcraft-, StarCraft, or Diablo- inspired creations. We'll be picking five winners for the best cakes, five winners for the best candies or cookies, and five winners for the best gingerbread houses.

To learn more about these two contests, visit our contest page - http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/contests/holiday07/index.xml http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/contests/holiday07/index.xml

And while we're talking about cooking, TheBronzeKettle.com http://www.thebronzekettle.com/?p=83 just published their recipe of ... Winter Veil Cookies http://www.thebronzekettle.com/?p=83 !
