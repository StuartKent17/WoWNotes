Patch 5.2 Tweets
More Patch 5.2 info appeared on Twitter today! 
Are you happy with the burst damage in PVP? What changes can we expect? You nerf items, are you still going to nerf spells too?ty 
It's prolly still too high. We're def looking at specific abilities/cooldowns. You'll likely see 5.2 changes to major outliers. Source https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/281469807398891520

How about a stacking buff for your farm that reduces pests the more consecutive days you plant/till?
Been brainstorming w/ @DaveKosak & @mumper flavorful ways to make farmers more efficient at tending w/ time. Source https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/281471493777522689

Are there any plans to buff Unholy Death Knights? It's really sad how underpowered this spec is right now. 
You'll likely see some love in 5.2. Unrelated, my current main is Unholy. Source https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/281551898320990208

Can this mount collector expect to see some new mounts in 5.2? Still hoping for 200+ mount achievement! 
New mounts not a bad thing to hope for, I reckon. Source https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/281470052249767937

Lor'themar assemblies the troops after the Purge of Dal. Is that to attack Ally or Garrosh or to take to Pandaria? 
Lor'themar's plans will be clear once 5.2 starts! Source https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/280552214286725120

Maybe you guys have not noticed how op Fluxfire Feline http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/68838-fluxfire-feline is. Wind-Up http://www.wowdb.com/pet-abilities/459-wind-up with Supercharge http://www.wowdb.com/pet-abilities/208-supercharge damage 1800+ 
Yup, changes on this combo are coming in 5.2.0. Source https://twitter.com/mumper/status/281114050237169666

Please roll bandages and upgrade stones into the battle pet journal UI or make them acct. bound so we can mule them. Bag space
Bandages stack up to 25 in 5.2.0. We intend for players to use stones, not stockpile. Hence the low stack size.
Can they at least become boa? cutting the many stacks we have basically in half doesn't really help much. 
Battle Pet Bandages bind to Battle.net accounts in 5.2.0 as well. It's like we read your mind! Source https://twitter.com/mumper/status/281434644396773377

Is it intended that the "Nether Roach http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/62625-nether-roach" does not count as cockroach, so its Apocalypse http://www.wowdb.com/pet-abilities/519-apocalypse ability kills itself? 
This is fixed in 5.2.0 Source https://twitter.com/mumper/status/281519611126632448

Also, does this mean being pulled out of a battle due to PVP/PVE agro will also despawn the pet? 
We have some plans in regards to making this all smoother in 5.2.0, we will share info soon. PVP interaction was not changed. Source https://twitter.com/mumper/status/281584334811586560

Do you know why battle pets don't show up in my auctions on mobile app? 
We hope to have pet cages working on the Mobile AH in an update early next year. Source https://twitter.com/mumper/status/281532366323843072

Changes to Tillers Farm
I love my farm. I love that I have all of my best friends to help me with my farm. But wouldn't it be nice if...

You could jump onto Miss Fifi and stamp all the vermin out of your occupied soil.
Your dog would chase away the birds from your alluring veggies.
The chickens would lay eggs.
The pigs would...fertilize...a crop or two....
While some of this has to do with tuning, we are considering some improvements to the farm and in this area. We might need to adjust the numbers a bit to reduce, say, Alluring over time. But we do want to make you feel that you need to tend to things regularly, even if you become more efficient in handling it. Though, perhaps we can consider allowing more crops to randomly grow without any obstacles or challenges, especially after you’ve proven your farming savvy.

PvP Balance Feedback
Would you agree its more balanced than it was from the start of the season up to the new patch? 

I think it is, but there is still alot of tweaks you could say that need to be worked out.
I agree that it has gotten better, but we know that there's more ground to cover and we're always working to improve. In light of that, there are still many more changes coming in patch 5.2. 

I can't talk about them just yet, but keep your eyes open for more information in the coming weeks. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/248737-pvp-getting-more-balanced/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7415462899?page=1#19

Elder Charms Mandatory?
charm are mandatory if you want to be up to par, if you're lucky you get 3 extra items per week
They aren't mandatory though. You can raid just fine without them. Yes, you won't gear as fast assuming you get items from them relatively often, but it's not going to impact your character in a negative way, other than *perhaps* missing an upgrade since you don't even have the guarantee you'll get one through the charms.

Elder Charms in LFR
On Raid Finder you can use the coin on bosses you've already killed that week. And every time you'll have the same chance of getting loot. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/248745-verify-about-elder-charms/ / Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6200810354?page=1#4

LFR Loot System Feedback
Actually it won't make a difference. Under the old system, a boss would drop 4 or 5 items that would be split among 25 people. With the current system, everyone has an individual chance for loot which means that 3 shamans and 4 paladins may very well each get that shield they need. It is also mathematically possible that all 25 people in the raid get an item from one boss and that the next boss has no loot for anyone.
Exactly this. 

With the old system, you not only had to hope that the item you needed dropped in the first place, you also had to roll against many people to get it. We were hearing a lot of feedback that the need/greed system was being used incorrectly by people that didn't actually need items, but pressed Need anyway. This new system takes that factor out of the equation completely. 

Yes, it does mean that you will occasionally get an item you already have—think of this as winning something that no one needed with a Greed roll—but it also means you'll never lose an item you need to someone who doesn't need it, as happened previously.

Archaeology Feedback
Archaeology is also a secondary profession, which kind of implies it should not provide better items or improvements than primary professions. Of course on the other hand, being a secondary profession makes it possible for everyone to have it which makes it a somewhat nice profession since it sort of implies equality between players. 

The truth is, archaeology is not for everyone, although we have cut down on the necessary travel time to find dig sites by having 6 dig locations per site instead of 3, and added some extra surprise dig sites in Pandaria, there’s still players who won’t go for it, and that’s perfectly fine, there’s a lot of different content in MoP that was made to appeal to different kinds of players.

Keep in mind that we’re still in the very early stages of MoP, we have said that we wanted to keep updating the game and adding patches more frequently with this expansion, chances are, professions might also get some love with some of those patches, so don’t despair, it’s still only the beginning.

Whenever we have some news regarding updates to any of the professions we'll make sure to let you know. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/248714-what-about-archaeology/ / Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6161066590?page=1#3

Professions
yeah said that a while back. Did the mode spawn rate increase, maybe?
We felt that at the 1:3 conversion that Spirits were simply a GL delivery mechanism and not used for other things. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273612006651744256

Any chance we will see a new alchemy cauldron for future MoP raids?
We like the group being able to provide food but players being responsible for their own flasks. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274016949611155456

why the change to daily/acct for Blingtron? It was just a fun prize... I don't see harm in it being per character 
Felt like a chore to log in every alt to get gold and maximize chance for good stuff. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274645336885170176

What's the thinking for tailoring putting new, larger bag recipe behind 2 rep grinds? Was 12 daily crafts per bag not enough?
Making Imperial Silk takes a commitment of logging in for 2 min a day. Not much gameplay there. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275621122932879360

Future
Have you guys considered something cooperative like the AQ gates war effort to get people out and about? Was a great event.
Yeah it was. Just need a model that doesn't force everyone to one spot and crash the servers. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275983606491516928

Challenge for us is providing enough content for players who want to play a lot without alienating those who can't. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/268769496414699520

with all the success of wow what 3 things do you think blizzard could improve upon?
If you mean WRT WoW, I'd say 1 Faster content, 2 More direction at max level, 3 easier for returning players to ease back in. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/269560395805626368
