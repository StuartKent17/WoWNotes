The cooldown for paid character transfers has been changed from 6 to 3 months, not 1 month like it was rumored during the last weeks. Good time to use the Recruitment forums in my opinion ! <br>
Both regions should currently have a 3 month cool-down. I&apos;ll make sure to get that confirmed though, and will post a correction if needed. <br>
<br>
The first plan was to lower it to one month in the US and in Europe, but we decided to go for three months instead. The change of mind came between the US and European posts being made, hence why the one month cool-down was posted (and active for a short time) in the US, but not in Europe. <br>

AFK Debuff in Alterac Valley<br>
Hortus made a very small post about the report of AFK players in Alterac Valley. He didn&apos;t give an exact value but it seems that the amount of reports required to put a debuff on a player will be low.<br>
It does not require 30 people to trigger the AFK buff... I don&apos;t know where people are getting this idea.<br>

<br>
Reminder if you don&apos;t know yet what&apos;s the debuff<br>
We are adding a feature with patch 2.2.0 that gives players the ability to report afkers in the battlegrounds. Once they have enough reports on them they will get a debuff that will count down 30 seconds. They will need to engage in combat during that time or they will get another debuff that will prevent them from gaining any further honor. Once they engage in combat, the debuff is removed immediately.<br>
<br>
There is debate on both sides of the coin as to whether this will be the solution to AFKers, but we wanted to give a way for players to take some action against people camping in Battlegrounds that had some impact. <br>
