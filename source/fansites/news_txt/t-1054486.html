Mists of Pandaria Dungeons and Raids<br>
We will hear more from Blizzard in January, but while things are quiet we can take this opportunity to review the new features that are coming in Mists of Pandaria (http://www.wowpedia.org/World_of_Warcraft:_Mists_of_Pandaria). We begin with the Dungeons and Raid information that was announced so far, using dedicated threads in our Mists of Pandaria forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/340-Mists-of-Pandaria-General-Discussions).<br>
