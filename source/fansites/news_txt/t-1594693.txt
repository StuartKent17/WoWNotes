Before you can harbor any hope of defeating the Iron Horde, you must first understand what—and whom—you’re up against. Our five-part series Lords of War introduces you to some of the major players in the campaign on Draenor, continuing today with the tale of Kilrogg Deadeye, powerful chieftan of the Bleeding Hollow clan.

The Bleeding Hollow clan once stood on the verge of extinction. To escape death, Kilrogg Deadeye first had to embrace it.
