Patch 5.4 Vengeance Change
Ghostcrawler talked about a potential change to how Vengeance http://www.wowdb.com/spells/93098-vengeance works in Patch 5.4 last week, as well as answering a few questions about it. 


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/may/veng54Changes.png https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335073711105376256 

Please don't do this. I do not wish to be made back into a simple meatshield. Staying alive and doing good damage is fun.
Your damage will still be fine and higher than pre Vengeance. Tanks don't need to win meters IMO. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335221769986265088

Who benefits from this change? dps who like topping metres?
Healers who don't have to contend with tanks sitting in fires? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335232096404643841

If all that loot didn't get people running 25 mans why do you think vengeance will? I don't get it man honestly.
It's not intended as a 25 perk. The environments are different in terms of DPS and require different numbers. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335223312722587648

I think it's in addition to the PvP nerf tanks are getting theyre working hard to balance PvP and it's PvE
It's not a PvP issue. It's some protection against tanks doing unusual or goofy things to increase their AP to unintended levels. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335224955790823424

Why do you want to make tanking more difficult? I would think with few tanks and healers you would want to make it easier.
Do some quick calculations. Do your tanks hit those numbers regularly without doing things like solo tanking? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335231771333496832
If that's your reasoning I guess I understand it. If your goal is to make solo tanking harder this will do it. 
We do want to make solo tanking harder on fights intended for 2 tanks. Solo tanking is fun to a degree, but it shouldn't be the right answer to increase DPS or mitigation. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335796194687188992
Just want to point out that this change would hurt 10m far more than 25m though, compounding factors involved. I really don't understand why you think the cap in 25m should be higher than 10m even with higher tank damage.
Tanks are a greater percent of damage done in 10s. 1 per 4 DPS rather than 1 per 7 or so in 25s. Which means tanks should care more about their damage in 10s than in 25s which is odd. And because tanks do get hit harder in 25s they need more Vengeance to translate to higher active mitigation. So we think the pitch is sound on those fronts. Where it runs into trouble is that tanks don't have the same health. When the cap is lower, high health tanks will just have higher Vengeance. Furthermore, mitigation not based on Vengeance, such as Death Strike, just become more powerful at the cap. These are problems we'd have to solve if we go through with it, but there should be lots of PTR testing for 5.4. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335794908067672067

Seems like a 180 from what you preached awhile ago, awhen you were fine with it. Why the change in philosophy?
Tank DPS will still be quite high even with this change. Wait for some players to estimate numbers. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335232271554592770

I can't understand, why tanks dps was affected by this feature, if you could have just buffed threat directly.
We like for tank damage to be relevant, and for active mitigation to scale. Vengeance provides all of that in addition to threat. Having huge threat modifiers on low damage abilities was also something tank complained about constantly. It may bug DPS players to get out DPSd by a tank, which is understandable, but that happened in dungeons way before Vengeance. Overall Vengeance still solves a lot more problems than it creates. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336246046797746177

Perhaps the source of vengeance needs to be looked at. Im not sure the complexity but can ground aoe not give it
Yes. We are going to start flagging certain ground mechanics to not give Venegance. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336249388903047168


Random Battleground Healer Balancing Disabled
It looks like the long queue times were being caused by the new balancing system.

Elite Gear and Rating Requirements
Don't worry, elite gear tied to rating is coming back next season. 
As I understand it, this is indeed the current plan. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/261258-so-t2-elite-gear-25000-cap-only-what/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8874477775?page=1#9

Talent Choice Simplicity
Well. To be fair, a lot of people never look up how to spec their characters, and so in those cases the old system probably felt slightly more dynamic. Unfortunately what they didn't know is that their choices were probably wrong. But maybe they don't care that their choices were wrong and their character was suboptimal - that's an honest way to play a game. Not everyone wants to ensure their character is maximizing its output, and it's the look and feel of the system that's more important than its actual effect.

That said, the new trees are still superior in offering competing options and each one can change up how your character plays, and differentiate it from someone else. If you look at build guides these days the suggestions for talents are usually just breakdowns on how each one works and which ones work better in what situations. There generally aren't any clear cut builds because most choices are viable depending on what you're doing. Obviously everyone is going to have favorites, but the fact that talent builds are a discussion instead of a map on how to place points, I think it's worked out quite well.

I'll add in the caveat that it's not perfect, some trees don't offer great options, some options aren't taken very often, and those are things we'll continue to tweak. Overall though we're quite happy with how the new trees have hit the goals we set forth.

Conquest Point Catch Up
I've not even done arena on this char in this season, and my cap is only 10k. 
This is because the catch up system doesn't function as is explained in the opening post of this thread. The cap you mentioned in your post is actually correct if you have not earnt any Conquest points yet this season, because we are in week 10. The formula is as follows As Russlad said:

Week of season x 1000 - Conquest already earned. = Conquest cap 

If the result of this equation is a negative or below your normal weekly cap, this means that your Conquest cap will be calculated as it would any other normal week.

If you weren't 90 during those weeks you missed don't get any extra points from what I understand. Seems kinda buggy, my SP that has missed loads of weeks didn't get a bigger cap either but granted it has full gear. 
This is incorrect. If a character dinged level 90 this week, their cap would be the same as a character that has been level 90 since patch 5.2 but has not earned any Conquest points this season. You do not miss out on cap for weeks of the season that you were not level 90 for.

Please dont nerf flying because of a small minority sport like world pvp.
We like the MoP solution for now - no flying while leveling with some no fly zones on top of that. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332561189466943488

Consider adding a LFD-style bag system to LFR. Dps get shorter queues, tanks and healers get occasional rewards. Everyone wins
We might. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331875826192760832

How long do you think your expansion design methodology new continent, new class/race, 3 new herbs/ores/cloth can last?
I think players want to see some new gameplay too and not just new iterations of the things they've seen before. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331888826760953858
Even if they aren't for you, challenge modes, pet battles, the farm, scenarios were all new types of ways to spend time. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331888954129387520

Not saying it’s bad, I like it…just feels totally different.
The 5.0 talent design will stick around for awhile. We agree that leveling is missing frequent rewards though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332575909649457152
The *current* talent design feels pretty solid to us. We'll iterate but no overhaul plans. #famouslastwords Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332638175405150208

Why not spend time optimizing existing game systems like crafting instead of adding new systems that eat up developer time?
Ideally we try to do a little of both. Some players get bored of the old systems even if they are very well polished. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332567027610951680

A patch used to include dungeons and raids, not a patch is just balance and dailies.
Dragon Soul came with few new boss models and virtually no new architecture because of the 3 dungeons included in that patch. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331891490609582080
By contrast, Throne of Thunder has a lot of new boss models and a lot of architecture. It came at the expense of no dungeons. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331891691449626625
Is there a happy medium? Can we do both? Perhaps. It's something we will work on in the future. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331891765915308033
Now granted many players enjoyed the heck out of those dungeons. But others were quite candid about the raid. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331891596926791680
This makes me believe that dungeons take a lot more effort than many peeps realize. oO Loved the Eternity one.
The architecture the physical dungeon takes a very long time. The encounters take time too, but usually less. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331924508992733184
You can mitigate that by doing outdoor dungeons, but it's easy to overdo those. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331924600046907393
Why can't the scenario team work on dungeons instead? Can't stand scenarios as healer; even in guild as disc.
Good dungeons require a lot of art. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332544999587737601

ICC had new boss models, a lot of arche AND dungs. And you were going to hire more people since 4 years ago
We could only do that because the previous tier had a rather small raid and dungeon that are not universally loved. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332561738639753216
We could delay patches more in order to have more content per patch. Not sure that's the right answer either. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332561861746761728
Could also hire more, which we are trying to do. That's a slow solution though unless you're willing to sacrifice quality. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332562136695992321
Couldn't you combine Scenarios with 5 man logic and use existing environment? Same for raids?
We could, yes. Concern would be that players may view that as rehashed content and not the "real" dungeons they were looking for. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332575015809724416

I hope you guys understand the no new 5 mans announcement, non-queueing for heroic scenarios, etc. drive away casual players.
We're not sure that just 1-3 new dungeons provides content for players for very long. Even Magister's I didn't run 30-40 times. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332554182211022849

tri-spec won't happen, fine... Where are the proving grounds? A whisper in the wind.
Working on them. But when we talk about unannounced features too much they tend to become "promises." Just the way it goes. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332564235450191872

Why not use scenario to show progress in the stories in EK/Kalimdor? Like scenario showing the war in Ashenvale/Gilneas?
That would be cool. Currently our scenarios are focused on recent events, but the possibility certainly exists. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331932036552069121

Will an item level squish affect our ability to solo older content? If it doesn't, I have no problem with it.
The goal is it will not affect your ability to solo older content. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331879944839917568
Squish is useless, because it just delays the inevitable. Numbers will get out of hand again. Regular squishs inc?
Maybe? With the squish we had planned for MoP, we wouldn't need to do it again for 2-3 expansions. Every 1 might feel weird. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331924010856222721

Any plans to impelement an in game voice communication? You need other software to play any serious pve/pvp. Isn't that weird?
Would love to do it, but it's one of those solutions that you have to get right and we certainly did not with our first attempt. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331880773512753153
