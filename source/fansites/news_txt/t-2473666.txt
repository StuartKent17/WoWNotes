chaud2019-03-22, 06:55 PMFuture Transmog Update - Hide All Slots Except for Pants
So why not let us hide EVERYTHING!
Okay! Done.

Except for the pants.

I spoke to the development team just now, and they are determined to make this a set of changes that give players ways to hide every slot.

Except pants.

We’ll let you know as soon as we have details on how that’s going to come about in a future update to the game.
