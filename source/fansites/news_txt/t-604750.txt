* - Items with a * after their name are available from the vendor on the Sunwell Isle if you can provide the loot above it on the list along with a Sunmote. 

Example - You can get the Helm of Uther's Resolve * http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/helmofuthersresolve.jpg by trading it to the vendor for Helm of Burning Righteousness http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/helmofburningrighteousness.jpg and a [item=34664]

Bosses
Note on Kil'jaeden loot : Nobody killed him yet, however he will most likely be the only one dropping ilvl 164 items. You can already check a few of them at the Sunwell vendor but I'll only list the 3 that really look like they drop from Kil'jaeden himself based on their itemID mostly. The three additional items are the one you can get from the vendor with an additional Sunmote, and Apolyon was added because it's an ilvl 164 weapon and that's probably the only boss it could drop from. Same goes for Thori'dal, it's confirmed to be a drop and I don't really see how it could not drop from the last boss of the dungeon. Be careful though, the stats of both items are based on the leak posted a few weeks ago

Unknown bosses
A lot of weapons stats have been leaked through this Sunwell Loot screenshot http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/sunwell_loots.jpg released before the PTR, so far nothing changed and you probably want to check it for items that aren't listed below yet.

Dungeon Loot
Legendary bow
The legendary bow is indeed named Thori'dal and supposedly drops from Kil'jaeden. And since everyone will ask for a proof, here are the spell IDs for some of the bonuses. The spell names and bonuses are directly from the patch released today

44972 : Legendary Bow Haste - Increases ranged attack speed by 15%. Does not stack with quiver or ammo pouch haste effects.
46699 : Requires No Ammo - Thori'dal generates magical arrows when the bow string is drawn. Does not use ammo.

Sunwell plateau
The old Sunwell Loot screenshot http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/sunwell_loots.jpg is now confirmed. Bonuses on items are considered as spells and are directly added to the patch files, even if none of them dropped yet we can confirm that some of these loots are true and you can probably consider all of them legit now.

Few examples of spells used in these items
45059 : Vessel of the Naaru - Collects 100 Holy Energy from healing spells you cast. Cannot collect more than ${100*20} Holy Energy.
45064 : Vessel of the Naaru - Release all accumulated Holy Energy to instantly heal current friendly target by the amount of Holy Energy accumulated.
45355 : Item - T7 Melee Trinket Base - Chance on hit to enter a Battle Trance, during which your melee or ranged attacks will each grant 44 attack power, stacking up to 10 times. Expires after 20 seconds.

General <ul> The combined forces of Shattrath have launched an attack on the Isle of Quel’Danas, to confront Kael’thas and the Legion at the Sunwell and surrounding areas. &#32;Players will now be able to gain reputation with the Shattered Sun Offensive and participate in a new set of daily quests. A representative of the Keepers of Time has been spotted at the World’s End Tavern in Shattrath. &#32;Players in good standing with the faction will be granted ease of passage to the Caverns of Time. Characters will now retain talented spell ranks so when they retalent they do not have to relearn the spells from trainers. Spell Haste: Spell haste now reduces the global cooldown on spells, down to a minimum of 1 second. &#32;This change does not apply to melee and ranged abilities. Item Cast Spells: &#32;Many spells cast by items were being cast as if the caster were the same level as the item. &#32;Most of those will now cast at the player’s level, giving them a reasonable chance to miss, be dispelled, or be resisted. Resilience: Now reduces the magnitude of mana draining effects by the same amount that it reduces critical strike damage. &#32;The Tooltip has been revised to reflect this.

Natural Perfection: This ability will no longer be triggered by taking critical strikes while sitting. In addition, it is now affected by the Subtlety talent. When a Druid in cat form casts Pounce it will now properly animate. [/list]

Hunter <ul> Equipping a thrown weapon while in the middle of an Auto-Shot will no longer cause animation issues. Casting Flare while in any way not visible, will no longer cause your flare to be invisible to other players. Hunter’s Mark: Hunters with Improved Hunter’s Mark will now properly overwrite Hunter’s Mark cast by Hunters without the talent. The stamina tooltip for hunter pets will now display the proper health increase. Hunters will no longer spin around if they cast Aimed Shot or Steady Shot while facing away from their target.

Judgment of the Crusader: It is no longer possible to have icons for two different ranks of Judgment of the Crusader appear at the same time when judged by multiple Paladins. Judgment of Wisdom: Some abilities such as Frostbolt were not triggering the mana energize effect from this spell. This has now been fixed. [/list]

Priests <ul> Fear Ward is now usable while in Shadow form. Inner Focus: Chastise now benefits from Inner Focus. &#32;In addition, Starshards no longer consumes Inner Focus. Power Word: Shield: Using low ranks of this spell will now be penalized the same way healing spells are penalized. Prayer of Mending: This spell will now fade from players who leave or enter an instance, change continents, or exit the game. Reflective Shield: The reactive damage from this talent no longer breaks crowd control affects which break on taking damage. Shadowguard: No longer consumes the charge of Inner Focus when triggered.
