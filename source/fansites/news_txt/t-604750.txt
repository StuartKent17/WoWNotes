* - Items with a * after their name are available from the vendor on the Sunwell Isle if you can provide the loot above it on the list along with a Sunmote. 

Example - You can get the Helm of Uther's Resolve *  by trading it to the vendor for Helm of Burning Righteousness  and a [item=34664]

Bosses
Note on Kil'jaeden loot : Nobody killed him yet, however he will most likely be the only one dropping ilvl 164 items. You can already check a few of them at the Sunwell vendor but I'll only list the 3 that really look like they drop from Kil'jaeden himself based on their itemID mostly. The three additional items are the one you can get from the vendor with an additional Sunmote, and Apolyon was added because it's an ilvl 164 weapon and that's probably the only boss it could drop from. Same goes for Thori'dal, it's confirmed to be a drop and I don't really see how it could not drop from the last boss of the dungeon. Be careful though, the stats of both items are based on the leak posted a few weeks ago

46699 : Requires No Ammo - Thori'dal generates magical arrows when the bow string is drawn. Does not use ammo.

<font face=arial size=2> The Sunwell Isle <ul> The Sunwell Isle is now available for play. &#32;This area includes a new quest hub and 5-player and 25-player instances. &#32;Join the Shattered Sun Offensive in shutting down Kael’thas’ nefarious operations. &#32;This new force is comprised by both the Aldor and Scryers and is led by the Naaru. &#32;Players will take part in claiming Sun’s Reach and setting up a larger base of operation to stop Kael’thas and the Legion. [/list]

Combat Log Improvements <ul> The combat log has undergone improvements that allow more robust combat filtering including the ability to define custom colors for enemies and friends as well as combat filtering for self and others. [/list]

General <ul> The combined forces of Shattrath have launched an attack on the Isle of Quel’Danas, to confront Kael’thas and the Legion at the Sunwell and surrounding areas. &#32;Players will now be able to gain reputation with the Shattered Sun Offensive and participate in a new set of daily quests. A representative of the Keepers of Time has been spotted at the World’s End Tavern in Shattrath. &#32;Players in good standing with the faction will be granted ease of passage to the Caverns of Time. Characters will now retain talented spell ranks so when they retalent they do not have to relearn the spells from trainers. Spell Haste: Spell haste now reduces the global cooldown on spells, down to a minimum of 1 second. &#32;This change does not apply to melee and ranged abilities. Item Cast Spells: &#32;Many spells cast by items were being cast as if the caster were the same level as the item. &#32;Most of those will now cast at the player’s level, giving them a reasonable chance to miss, be dispelled, or be resisted. Resilience: Now reduces the magnitude of mana draining effects by the same amount that it reduces critical strike damage. &#32;The Tooltip has been revised to reflect this. Spirit-Based Mana Regeneration: This system has been adjusted so that as your intellect rises, you will regenerate more mana per point of spirit. Weapon Skill: Points will be gained faster in weapon skills for levels 1 through 59. The Daily Quest limit has been increased to 25. The benefits of drinking out of combat have been delayed. It will now take five seconds before the full benefit of the mana regeneration will come into effect. [/list]

Natural Perfection: This ability will no longer be triggered by taking critical strikes while sitting. In addition, it is now affected by the Subtlety talent. When a Druid in cat form casts Pounce it will now properly animate. [/list]

Hunter <ul> Equipping a thrown weapon while in the middle of an Auto-Shot will no longer cause animation issues. Casting Flare while in any way not visible, will no longer cause your flare to be invisible to other players. Hunter’s Mark: Hunters with Improved Hunter’s Mark will now properly overwrite Hunter’s Mark cast by Hunters without the talent. The stamina tooltip for hunter pets will now display the proper health increase. Hunters will no longer spin around if they cast Aimed Shot or Steady Shot while facing away from their target.

Judgment of the Crusader: It is no longer possible to have icons for two different ranks of Judgment of the Crusader appear at the same time when judged by multiple Paladins.

Priests <ul> Fear Ward is now usable while in Shadow form. Inner Focus: Chastise now benefits from Inner Focus. &#32;In addition, Starshards no longer consumes Inner Focus. Power Word: Shield: Using low ranks of this spell will now be penalized the same way healing spells are penalized. Prayer of Mending: This spell will now fade from players who leave or enter an instance, change continents, or exit the game. Reflective Shield: The reactive damage from this talent no longer breaks crowd control affects which break on taking damage. Shadowguard: No longer consumes the charge of Inner Focus when triggered.

Improved Hamstring Arms effect is now subject to diminishing returns when used in PvP. [/list]

PvP <ul> Diminishing returns on honor for kills is being eliminated. Honor will now be instantly calculated, and available for player use.

[/list] Battlegrounds &#32; <ul> &#32; If a player dies 50 times or more in a battleground, they will no longer be worth honor for the remainder of that battle. &#32; When you first enter a battleground, messages about other players joining the battleground will be linked together for the first minute. You will see a message in AV like "28 players joined" rather than a line for each player that joined. After the first minute, it will work as it always has. In addition all of the messages about other players leaving the battleground and getting marks of honor once the battleground is complete have been removed. &#32; Alterac Valley &#32; &#32; &#32;<ul> &#32; &#32; &#32; Captain Balinda Stonehearth now has additional spells, and she can no longer be slowed or locked out of a school with interrupts although she can still be interrupted. &#32; &#32; &#32; Vanndar Stormpike and Captain Balinda Stonehearth have had their health totals reduced to match the health totals of Drek’Thar and Captain Galvangar... &#32; Warmasters/marshals in Alterac Valley now increase each other’s maximum health and damage by 25%. &#32;This is a stacking effect. &#32; &#32; &#32; Horde players will now start the battle closer to Drek’Thar and Frostwolf Keep. &#32;[/list] &#32; Warsong Gulch &#32; &#32; <ul> &#32; &#32; When both flags are held, the flag carriers will receive 50% increased damage done to them after approximately 10 minutes and 100% increased damage after approximately 15 minutes. &#32; &#32; Flag carriers can now be tracked 45 seconds after picking up the flag.
