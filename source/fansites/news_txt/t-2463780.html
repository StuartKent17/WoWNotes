Dungeons and Raids<br>

<br>
The achievement Can I Get a Hek Hek Hek Yeah? (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13316-can-i-get-a-hek-hek-hek-yeah) now requires all members of the raid click on the Mysterious Trashpile before the fight starts to receive Jani&apos;s Favor, and then complete the existing criteria for the achievement.<br>
Fixed a bug that prevented some players from receiving the achievement The Hidden Dragon on Normal difficulty.<br>
Fixed an issue that sometimes caused Arcane Torrent to remain available when changing factions.<br>
<br>

Items<br>
<br>
Emissary armor, weapon caches, and rewards from faction assaults now reward the item by loot specialization. These were previously rewarded by class.<br>

Developers&#x2019; note: With the start of Battle for Azeroth Season 2, we introduced two new trinkets that are acquired via PvP, Sinister Gladiator&#x2019;s Maledict and Sinister Gladiator&#x2019;s Safeguard. In agreement with feedback we&#x2019;ve been receiving, we&#x2019;ve made a few changes to these items so that they provide more of an opportunity for counterplay when encountering enemy teams using these trinkets. We&#x2019;ll continue to keep an eye on the strength of these trinkets as the season progresses.<br>
