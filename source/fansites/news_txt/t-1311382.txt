Patch 5.4 Warlock Changes Update
We're going to try keeping Fel Flame as an instant, slightly buffed, with no DoT refeshing. Intent wasn't to nerf Fel Flame on top of nerfing Kil'Jaeden's Cunning. As long as locks don't become backpedaling Fel Flame spamming machines, we think this change should work.


Blue Tweets
Classes
From strictly a design perspective, why does every class need a viable dps spec?
It doesn't. You could design the game without. Overall we reacted to feedback from the community that they want viable DPS specs. Source 
But you could say e.g. priests are just healers or you could have buffer or support classes with low DPS. Just a different design. Source 
Interesting, thanks! Followup: could you see WoW as ever having a class with a role other than tank/heal/dps in the future?
Yes, but it would be a big change. Another challenge for the blogs and forums out there to discuss. Source 

I think GC has hinted previously that he thinks hunter specs should be more different
Yup. Hunter and rogue specs play too similarly in our opinions. Don't expect massive overhauls. Source 

what would make a raid leader chose a rogue over all those classes? not mentioning they are the only melee single role
I don't know that you *need* a rogue or any class. We don't see rogues being sat though. Plenty of every class raiding. Source 

WW monks need healing to be less of a dps loss?!? How about spriests? just read icy veins interview
Our thought was that Shadow has a lot of other utility for a group. Healing is one of Windwalker's main contributions. Source 
Healing WAS shadow's main contribution. Nerfed to the ground for the sake of PvP.
It's not fair for them to have healing, mana, dispels and things like life grip on top of great damage and survivability. Source 

I think Homogenization is good for core things like interrupts, but is bad for more iconic abilities.
That's actually what we aim for. We don't always nail it 100%. Source 

I will mail you one of my summer reading recommendations if you address that one and clarify the Icy Veins response.Neina was right. It was energy capping during AR. Low GCD helps burn energy, but not a solution we will use often. Source 
We are a bit defensive about GCD. Players always want less, because fast, responsive combat is fun. Source 
And while WoW combat is responsive hint one of the secrets of our success we are a server game and can't do Street Fighter. Source 

How do you balance CC that breaks on DMG when moves such as Howling Blast AE's everything and is apart of main rotation
Don't use HB if you absolutely can't afford to break the CC? Source 

Reputation / Questing
Questing is designed for dps specs?
That was more true in Vanilla or BC. You can quest with just about any spec these days. Source 
Even if you can't kill things as fast as DPS, you don't spend 100% of your time in combat and Ts and Hs have other perks. Source 

I guess the officers in your guild don't mind if someone doesn't gem, enchant and reforge their gear as well?
That is expected because it is much less work and meaningfully impacts performance. Getting a belt slower does not. Source 

Problem with caps: They make it feel like you need to meet them. If I get 500 VP one week, that's 500 VP gone forever.
Totally. And they aren't there as a target. They are there to discourage dude with too much time from grinding 10k a week. Source 
Because the next thing we'd hear is: How am *I* supposed to grind 10K a week?! Source 
do you find lesser->elder charm system worked well? And have you thought making Valor similar? i.e limit SPENT, not GAIN
Yes and yes. Source 

Really enjoying the 5.3 Barrens questing. Weekly VP quest, random escorts, commanders, epic item drops are all fun!
Cool! If feedback is good, we'll certainly do more of it. Not all outdoor adventuring needs to be blue bangs. Source 

Many players hate dailies - are you absolutely sure, game needs them?
No, but the game does need something to get players out of queuing for instances from Org /SW. Source 

I'm tired of doing dailies?We are all tired of doing this.we play game to have fun,not tired.
So don't do them? What is the specific reward that you feel requires you to run so many dailies? Source 
Honestly dailies are the quickest way to get lesser charms, I know there are other ways, but rng on those, dailies are boring
I'm not sure that's true. Last week I got my charms by making a group and farming Barrens bosses. Source 
GC seems to be missing the point, what is the difference between farming barrens and dailies? Same thing.
If you never want to leave instances, just understand you're going to have a lot less content than other players. Source 

There was nothing wrong with the rep tabard system. You changed it to dailies and dont like the fallout. GG
I've explained before why we didn't like the tabard rep system, but once again: Source 
1 It removed the world from WoW by letting instances provide all rewards in the most efficient way. Source 
2 It made you manage a bunch of tabards in your UI. "Oops. Left the one I wanted in my bank." Source 
The champion system lets you get some rep from dungeons without item management. We like it better. Source 

Also making you get rep with GL before SP was silly. If you didnt want ppl to be overwhelmed. Make GL have 5 not 12 a day.
It hasn't been that way in some time though. If you're still worried about GL rep, you might be missing out on a lot of content. Source 
We're gonna be in 7.0 and people will still be crying about GL/dailies being mandatory
Just remember this tweet in a couple of weeks. Source 

I don't find dailies fun and don't find coming in lower on the DPS chart than I should because I didn't do them fun either.
How is your DPS lower because you didn't do dailies? Source
