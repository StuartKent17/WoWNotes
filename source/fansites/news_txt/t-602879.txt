Nothing really interesting today, except for hunters and guild chat spammers maybe. 
Hunters
1 yard range is a lie the cake too. It's actually a tooltip error and it should be "5-35 yards", you shouldn't be able to shot someone while being meleed. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2649575219&postId=25734526999&sid=1#34

PvP
Patch 2.3 and season 3 may not start on the same date, Blizzard plan to give a two week notice on the start of season 3. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2647295317&postId=25734527156&sid=1#2

Hallow's End
Items with a duration on them won't all vanish on November first, you just won't be able to get any new ones. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2647305108&postId=25734527485&sid=1#131

Others
Flying mounts in Azeroth seems to definitely be something Blizzard wants to implement at some point. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2040217823&postId=25734528161&sid=1#6

It's been a long time since the last video posted in news ! Anyway, Baron Soosdon released another volume of Unlimited Escapism http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=48525, as usual it's really really nice, and you'll probably enjoy it if you liked the others.
