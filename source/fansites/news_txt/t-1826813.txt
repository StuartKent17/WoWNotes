Blue Tweets
Classes
Thistle Tea http://www.wowdb.com/items/7676-thistle-tea now gives NEGATIVE - 20 Energy when consumed. I hope this is a bug.
Tooltip bug. It doesn’t consume any energy, but it doesn’t restore any either, at level 90+. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623665534182109184

btw serious question; as a mage when you try to pet nova on a mount is it intentional that it wont work until you get off the mount
yes holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/623941732548280320

Can you please clarify what is affected by Sword of Light? Everything or only certain abilties?
It affects most things, with a few exceptions. Conceptually it affects attacks with a weapon, even Judgment/Final Verdict. 1/2 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623666713847013376
But Exorcism and Holy Prism would not be affected, for example. 2/2 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623666756754784256

Legendary DPS ring doesn't seem to be counting damage done by searing totem/magma totem.
Some totems are affected by the Legendary Rings a little unusually. They benefit twice from the damage increase... 1/2 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623668835686711296
...Instead of contributing to the explosion. Same total result. 2/2 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623668882889281536

Character / Items
Why can't i use Nithramus, the all-seer as mistweaver, i can equip it but when i try to use it it says item is not ready yet
The Legendary Rings only work for their intended roll. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623668029201743872

Timewalking
Why are we being scaled to iLV 160 in Wrath TW dungeons, which are the heroic versions? We're 40 iLVs below dungeon drops1/2
Post-squish, that’s close to an accurate ilvl. The feel of Wrath Timewalking is pretty authentic right now. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623664650714910720

Reputation / Questing
Was said before 6.2 that the Celestial rep req. for Alani was going away soon. Is that in 6.2.1?
Yes! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623653001400590337

If we clean Archimonde, then give back the 33 Tomes of Chaos. Can we still loot Crystallized Fel on a 2nd Arch kill same week?
Unfortunately you cannot due to the way the tracking system works – we’re looking into future improvements here. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623665030957940736


Ghostcrawler Tweets
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW and Game Design. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Dungeons
But Ghostcrawler, heroic dungeons are hard! I really enjoyed the hard Cata dungeons most in the past few years
Such an interesting time in my life. I couldn't motivate players to take on harder challenges and some never forgave me. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614860855079866368

World
was the creation of vashj'ir at all inspired by your PhD in marine science
No, though I did suggest the artists add pognophorans, which they did. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614584337166512128

Game Design
Do you think elitism is healthy for a MMORPG? And would you design endgame around it?
I think *aspiration* is very healthy. Not sure that must lead to elitism. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/616339297474482176

Can't make content last longer, but you sure can make it last much shorter.
I think you can make content longer *if* you add rewards. I think there is a magical time to reward ratio. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614575974718443520

So here's a question - how do you distinguish content as reward from drawing things out?
I think there is almost an internal clock of being ready for a reward / something new. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614644925854912512
Which is why you can't just add time without also adding rewards, extrinsic or intrinsic. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614645099432034304

I avoid games that I know I won’t be able to experience fully. Fallout 3, Skyrim, etc.
Yes. Exactly. That's the problem I'm trying to fix. I can't eat all this food so I'm not even going to step inside the taqueria. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614654162672840704

That said I really love a game that's designed to be a single awesome 10-20 hour experience. Even a tad longer like DX:HR
That's funny. I almost always play long games. I feel like short games aren't worth learning the rules. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614655247735091200
That is true even when it is an awesome short game so clearly it's not a rational conclusion on my part. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614655373308375041

I think there are short games and long games. To purposefully cut a long experience short seems wrong.
But is Witcher 3 a short game with a lot of optional content or a long game? I'd argue the former. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614655550127640576

What's wrong with being compelled to do something interesting/engaging? especially when optional Genuine question
Often they won't do it. They will look at the lovingly created content, appreciate the effort, and go play a smaller game. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614850259475238912
Any examples? This is blowing my mind
The 500 quests in Dragon Age Inquisition. Turned some folks off who didn't want to skip content but couldn't commit either. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614859312435826688

Substance. Substance is more important than these "rewards" it's all just an illusion of progress if it lacks substance.
I'm not sure I agree. Seeing a new room, earning a new piece of dialogue, or learning cut man's moves are all rewards. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614663133529944064
I don't think rewards are something dirty. I think they are why we find content compelling. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614663237699645440

Misc
if blizz offered you a completely absurd amount of money to come back to wow, would you?
I am sure there is a number at which it would be dumb to say no. I don't think it's likely I will ever go back though OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/615378010166824960
