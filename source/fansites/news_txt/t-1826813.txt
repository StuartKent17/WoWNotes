Thistle Tea  now gives NEGATIVE - 20 Energy when consumed. I hope this is a bug.
Tooltip bug. It doesn’t consume any energy, but it doesn’t restore any either, at level 90+. WarcraftDevs

btw serious question; as a mage when you try to pet nova on a mount is it intentional that it wont work until you get off the mount
yes holinka 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Can you please clarify what is affected by Sword of Light? Everything or only certain abilties?
It affects most things, with a few exceptions. Conceptually it affects attacks with a weapon, even Judgment/Final Verdict. 1/2 WarcraftDevs 
But Exorcism and Holy Prism would not be affected, for example. 2/2 WarcraftDevs 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Legendary DPS ring doesn't seem to be counting damage done by searing totem/magma totem.
Some totems are affected by the Legendary Rings a little unusually. They benefit twice from the damage increase... 1/2 WarcraftDevs 
...Instead of contributing to the explosion. Same total result. 2/2 WarcraftDevs 

Character / Items
Why can't i use Nithramus, the all-seer as mistweaver, i can equip it but when i try to use it it says item is not ready yet
The Legendary Rings only work for their intended roll. WarcraftDevs 

Timewalking
Why are we being scaled to iLV 160 in Wrath TW dungeons, which are the heroic versions? We're 40 iLVs below dungeon drops1/2
Post-squish, that’s close to an accurate ilvl. The feel of Wrath Timewalking is pretty authentic right now. WarcraftDevs 

Reputation / Questing
Was said before 6.2 that the Celestial rep req. for Alani was going away soon. Is that in 6.2.1?
Yes! WarcraftDevs 

If we clean Archimonde, then give back the 33 Tomes of Chaos. Can we still loot Crystallized Fel on a 2nd Arch kill same week?
Unfortunately you cannot due to the way the tracking system works – we’re looking into future improvements here. WarcraftDevs 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs  appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW and Game Design. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Dungeons
But Ghostcrawler, heroic dungeons are hard! I really enjoyed the hard Cata dungeons most in the past few years
Such an interesting time in my life. I couldn't motivate players to take on harder challenges and some never forgave me. OccupyGStreet 

World
was the creation of vashj'ir at all inspired by your PhD in marine science
No, though I did suggest the artists add pognophorans, which they did. OccupyGStreet 

Game Design
Do you think elitism is healthy for a MMORPG? And would you design endgame around it?
I think *aspiration* is very healthy. Not sure that must lead to elitism. OccupyGStreet 

Can't make content last longer, but you sure can make it last much shorter.
I think you can make content longer *if* you add rewards. I think there is a magical time to reward ratio. OccupyGStreet 

So here's a question - how do you distinguish content as reward from drawing things out?
I think there is almost an internal clock of being ready for a reward / something new. OccupyGStreet 
Which is why you can't just add time without also adding rewards, extrinsic or intrinsic. OccupyGStreet 

I avoid games that I know I won’t be able to experience fully. Fallout 3, Skyrim, etc.
Yes. Exactly. That's the problem I'm trying to fix. I can't eat all this food so I'm not even going to step inside the taqueria. OccupyGStreet 

That said I really love a game that's designed to be a single awesome 10-20 hour experience. Even a tad longer like DX:HR
That's funny. I almost always play long games. I feel like short games aren't worth learning the rules. OccupyGStreet 
That is true even when it is an awesome short game so clearly it's not a rational conclusion on my part. OccupyGStreet 

I think there are short games and long games. To purposefully cut a long experience short seems wrong.
But is Witcher 3 a short game with a lot of optional content or a long game? I'd argue the former. OccupyGStreet 

What's wrong with being compelled to do something interesting/engaging? especially when optional Genuine question
Often they won't do it. They will look at the lovingly created content, appreciate the effort, and go play a smaller game. OccupyGStreet 
Any examples? This is blowing my mind
The 500 quests in Dragon Age Inquisition. Turned some folks off who didn't want to skip content but couldn't commit either. OccupyGStreet 

Substance. Substance is more important than these "rewards" it's all just an illusion of progress if it lacks substance.
I'm not sure I agree. Seeing a new room, earning a new piece of dialogue, or learning cut man's moves are all rewards. OccupyGStreet 
I don't think rewards are something dirty. I think they are why we find content compelling. OccupyGStreet 

Misc
if blizz offered you a completely absurd amount of money to come back to wow, would you?
I am sure there is a number at which it would be dumb to say no. I don't think it's likely I will ever go back though OccupyGStreet
