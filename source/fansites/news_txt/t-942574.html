Blizzard finally announced the release of World of Warcraft in Brazil (see the press release below) 5 months after I first mentioned it in a news post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2186-WoW-Brazil-Blizzard-Slate-Blue-Posts-MMO-Report-Comics), proving once again that if I throw enough random stuff on the front page I will eventually be right every now and then! <br>
<br>

Brazilan and Japanese locale added in 4.0.6 - Blizzard Slate confirmed? (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2186-WoW-Brazil-Blizzard-Slate-Blue-Posts-MMO-Report-Comics)<br>

<br>
Also, some dates probably shifted a little since the release of that slate and realistically, the WoW movie probably got kicked out of the schedule for the moment.<br>
