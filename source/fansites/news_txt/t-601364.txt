New honor belt/boots/bracers skins are in the game files, I was too lazy to get them, but it seems they'll be upgraded too which explains why they're missing from the vendors for the moment

I couldn't get the Paladin shoulders, don't know if they're missing possible or if I was too stupid even more possible

For any other information, check the previous news.
