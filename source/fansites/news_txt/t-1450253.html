Warbringer now causes Charge to stun the target (used to cause Charge to root a target) for 3 seconds, reducing movement speed by 50% for 15 seconds, and generates 20 Rage. (Charge&apos;s root will *not* cause creatures to turn and attack you like most roots. - Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/429438186083733504))<br>

Are you going to look at raid buffs and which classes provide them for 6.0?<br>
Yep, there are a few changes planned for that, but not ready to announce details. Most unchanged, just filling in a couple holes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424002066181132288))<br>
<br>
Can we can get a healer training dummy in WoD? Something we can heal to put us in combat to check trinket procs / weak auras etc<br>
I&apos;ll see what we can do. No promises, but I definitely see the value. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424783948263092225))<br>

Could you make force of nature benefit from eclipse mastery or at least make them do more dmg in solar since they cast wrath?<br>
Depends whether they need it to compete with the other talents on their row. It&apos;s something we&apos;ll certainly consider. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424980642162434049))<br>

why weren&apos;t Monks a hero class?<br>
If you mean starting at a high level, because it didn&apos;t fit the story we were trying to tell with them. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424715378334257152))<br>
DKs were existing, powerful characters, that are unleashed on the world, well into their development/history. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424715725169651712))<br>

in wod will spriests get a new singel target ability like ms and mb to go with the new singel target talent?<br>
No new abilities, but we are planning to allow the to specialize more for single target, if they choose. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424983697960345601))<br>
first off im rly glad u are doing the specialization, but spamming ms and mb a whole fight seems abit boring <br>
If you&apos;re referring to Clarity of Power, the rotation is more complex than that. DP, MF, SW: D... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425000905293836289))<br>

melee as they follow ABA rule - Always be attacking - white hits are auto. So imp standing around = dps lose plain and simple<br>
The &apos;ABC Rule&apos;, as you call it, is very much true for the vast majority of casters, whose limited resource is time. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424248199780368385))<br>
The Imp&apos;s limited resource is energy, not time. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424248292419969025))<br>
Imp/Fel imp is a caster therefore they must follow the ABC rule of A(Always) B(Be) C (Casting), every caster knows that.<br>
No, they don&apos;t. They&apos;re an energy-based caster. Their DPS is limited by their energy regen, *not* their cast time. Really. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424247563512864768))<br>
around. His energy doesn&apos;t regein as fast as he can cast, so at some point 2min in he start standing around until he get 40<br>
It sounds like you think that him standing around at all is a DPS loss. It&apos;s not. His energy is 100% of his damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424240770774601728))<br>
As long as he&apos;s not energy capping, he is doing 100% of his potential DPS. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424240896335298560))<br>
<br>
Will green fire quest chain scaling up for WoD or let it in current lvl so every one will one shot it ? I wote for scale up.<br>
Stay current level. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424983060765868032))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
More players starting at 90 in WoD will increase BG queue times sub-90. Will BG brackets recombine in WoD (e.g. 70-79, 80-89 etc.)?<br>
I think we can combine more. The item squish, level and ilevel scaling mean power isn&apos;t as varied. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/424642604710363136))<br>
<br>
btw will you ever make it so we don&apos;t need to bake /focus arenaX into our macros?<br>
focus is implemented like targeting. If someone stealths, it drops. Will look into it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/424629912129912832))<br>
<br>
Is it purposeful that my worgen turns into a human when I enter an arena? Finally getting into PVP btw <br>
Welcome aboard. Arena clears a lot of auras. This is one we probably shouldn&apos;t clear. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/424616166040932352))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
Welp, WarFrame&apos;s added to the &quot;doubt I&apos;ll play that again&quot; list. Great movement, runs really well, but ugh the crafting/microtransations etc<br>
Personal design interest: when is spending $ in real &quot;fun&quot;, when does it suck &amp; what can games learn from that? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/425059862859362304))<br>
For instance, paying $ for clothes on sale = fun, paying $ to get your passport faster = lame (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/425060181869735936))<br>
