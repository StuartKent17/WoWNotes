Greetings and welcome to the WoW Classic Beta Test!

Below is a list of known issues for the initial WoW Classic Beta release. Please note that this list is not a complete depiction of what we’re aware of, but a sampling of issues we believe players may encounter with some regularity. We’ll try to keep this updated with trending issues when possible.

Classes and Combat:

Activating Raptor Strike while Auto Shot is toggled on does not cause the hunter to begin to Auto Attack in melee
Hunter pets do not auto-cast Dash or Dive when engaging their targets
Hunter pets may not immediately return to your side upon entering passive mode
Many talents are currently missing their requirements text


User Interface:

Attempting to sign into twitter through the interface option crashes the client
World map path indicators during transport loading screens may be inaccurate
Items with randomly generated stats will display the <Random Enchantment> tag in the loot window and chat tooltips when being looted


Creatures and NPCs:

Some creatures in the game world are missing textures


Environments:

There is a strip of missing water in the Mosshide Fen area of the Wetlands


Dungeons:

There is no water present in the Ironclad Cove area of the Deadmines dungeon
