Boubouille2008-01-24, 08:06 AMRogue - Cheating death bug
Yesterday I reported a blue post made by Hortus explaining that under specific timing circumstances, Cheat Death will sometimes reduce damage by 99% instead of 90%. It's not as bad as it look and it only affects the spell triggering Cheat Death, this is NOT 4 seconds of invulnerability for rogues.
When two spells land with exact timing activating cheat death the spells can receive 99% reduction instead of 90%. In the past when this happened the spells were not affected by Cheat Death at all.

This only affects the spells triggering cheat death and not subsequent spells and only happens under very specific circumstances which can not be purposely exploited. It does not give rogues "4 seconds of invulnerability" as some people have said.


Vendors in Boats and Zeppelins
They were supposed to be back in 2.3.2, and in 2.3.3, and they're still missing. It looks like fixing the bug is harder than expected and Blizzard can't give any ETA for a fix.
We had planned to get them back in recently, however, there were some issues of boats and zeppelins not functioning properly, so they were removed. While we'd still love to be able to get them back on duty, there is no definite eta on when or if this will happen.


Other bugs
Hortus answered on a few posts about other bugs too, let's hope that none of them will postpone the 2.4 to apply a minor patch once again.

Eye of the Storm matches freeze and finish early on some Battlegroups
We are aware of the issues with Eye of the Storm Battleground on some battle groups, it is being investigated. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4064465255&postId=41194683709&sid=1#8

Haste effects do not apply the correct amount of casting/attack increase
Example: 20% haste only increases cast speed by 17% 
The formula for haste effects is:
NEW_SPEED = OLD_SPEED / 1 + HASTE_PERCENT
This can be a bit confusing, but it assures that no amount of +haste effects will result in zero or negative attack or cast speed. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4068015736&postId=41194684365&sid=1#3
