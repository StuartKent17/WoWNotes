Transmog
regarding legion tmog system. if my hunter can equip a dagger does that unlock that daggers tmog for all toons?
The answer is yes, if you can equip it you unlock its appearance account-wide. Maybe try a less combative approach next time? WatcherDev 

PvP
if PvP gear iLvL in Legion is based on your rating, is it an average or your highest or?..
Each bracket will reward PvP gear based on your rating within that specific bracket. WarcraftDevs 

Lore
I thought it had been previously stated that the Heart had not exerted influence and that Garrosh was acting on his own
he wasn't corrupted or controlled, yes, but his personality flaws e.g. xenophobia certainly came out at 110% Muffinus
