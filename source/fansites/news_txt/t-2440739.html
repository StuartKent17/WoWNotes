Patch 8.1 - Upcoming Death Knight Changes<br>
After being told changes were coming to lock and dk 3 weeks ago, there have been nothing but further nerfs on the ptr. Its an actual joke at this point.<br>
Changes on the PTR for Death Knights in regards to PVP is not yet complete. More changes for Unholy and Frost are on the way and we hope to share those with you guys soon.<br>
<br>
One of those incoming changes for example is that we&apos;re reducing the runic power cost for Death Strike in 8.1 and increasing its healing for Unholy and Frost.<br>

BlizzCon Floor Map<br>
That&apos;s a big building. How many people can it accommodate?<br>
A lot. The Anaheim Convention Center is one of the biggest in the world I think. <br>
<br>
25,000-27,000 based on past blizzcon and other events in the anaheim convention center<br>
It can definitely hold more than that. Last year we said we had what 35k? <br>
<br>
Also we&apos;re only like 18 days away. I feel like if BlizzCon was a class it would definitely be a rogue, cause it sure does feel like it sneaks up on you. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769727461?page=1#4))<br>
