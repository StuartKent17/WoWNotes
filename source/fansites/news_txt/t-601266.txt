Nihilum http://www.nihilum.eu/news/53/ are finally getting ready for the Black Temple, and started killing bosses on the PTR yesterday. The first two on their list were Supremus and High Warlord Naj'entus and they successfully killed them in the same night.

So ... What's new ? They didn't have a GM to help, which kinda make it a double World First kill news. Anyway, it's not like you need a GM when Kungen is in the raid.

If you don't know why Kungen can deal 500 000 dmg with a single revenge crit, all the informations you need are
