Take a look at World of Warcraft&#x2019;s first official infographic below for some fun and surprising never-before-seen facts about the game.<br>
<br>
We hope everyone enjoys this glimpse at the inner workings of Azeroth&#x2014;feel free to find and share it on Facebook and Twitter. Thanks for being a part of World of Warcraft&#x2019;s history, and here&#x2019;s to new adventures with you in Warlords of Draenor!<br>

Garrosh Heirlooms and Bonus Rolls<br>
Following up on the Garrosh Heirloom bonus roll information yesterday (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3721-Level-90-Boost-Heirlooms-and-Bonus-Rolls-Dampening-Change-Low-Level-BGs-DLC) comes some more bonus roll clarifications:<br>
<br>
<br>
Quivering Blob (http://www.wowdb.com/items/97959-quivering-blob) can be won with a bonus roll, and doesn&apos;t take the place of an item you would have won. (Source (https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/428226900054376448))<br>
Nalak, Oondasta, Galleon, and Sha of Anger mounts can be Bonus Rolled. Raid mounts cannot. (Source (https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/428229005221691392))<br>
Reins of the Astral Cloud Serpent aren&apos;t (and have never been) Bonus Rollable. (Source (https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/428333691421487105))<br>
Kor&apos;kron Shaman&apos;s Treasure (http://www.wowdb.com/items/105751-korkron-shamans-treasure) cannot be bonus rolled. (Source (https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/428229753108058112))<br>
You can bonus roll Siege pets in appropriate difficulties due to community feedback about Quivering Blob. The pet is a separate roll from items, so it doesn&apos;t have any impact on winning other loot. (Source (https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/428234255269756928))<br>

Random Battleground Balance and Queue Times<br>
We talk about stuff like this from time to time, but it&apos;s not quite so simple. For example, queue times are a big issue. Separating players out by item level certainly wouldn&apos;t help, and in fact, could make things far worse. Having more equally-matched opponents in your random BG would be nice, but having to wait an hour or longer... not so much.<br>
<br>
That said, we&apos;re hoping to make a lot of improvements to Random BG&apos;s in Warlords. If we get the opportunity to do something like this, we can look into it.<br>
<br>
Side note since I brought it up: we&apos;re also looking into queue times. We have a few ideas for changes we might make, but nothing for certain to share just yet.

PvP Blue Posts<br>
One of my personal goals since I started at Blizzard has been to help improve communication with the PvP community. And, though I know it&apos;s technically a different forum, I&apos;ve been as active as possible on the Arena forums contributing what I can. Many of those concerns extend to BGs and RBGs as well, and if you have a concern here that&apos;s PvP-related but not necessarily specific to Battlegrounds, it might be a good idea to check the Arena forums too just in case.<br>
<br>
That said, I completely hear you guys on wanting to see more interaction in the Battlegrounds forums. I do read them regularly already, but I&apos;ll make a stronger effort to interact here more often.

PvE<br>
I miss using CC in dungeons and raids. Will this come back in WoD?<br>
Not using CC in dungeons currently is mostly a result of being way stronger than the content is designed for. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422465768588967936))<br>
I have needed 0 CC in MoP dungeons ever. Day 1 they were faceroll. Not saying that&apos;s 100% bad but it is true.<br>
You are more experienced/skilled than most. That was not the experience for the majority. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422595645359157249))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
With cross-realm arena it feels like there is still one final barrier: faction. Any plans for cross-faction teaming for real ID?<br>
No plans for that. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423191814128943104))<br>
<br>
yeah probably. I blame the 15 min ques between games! why are Horde ques so terrible?<br>
There are more horde queuing. The problem is exacerbated if you opt out of unpopular BGs. Looking into options. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423190461180674048))<br>
<br>
Future<br>
Trying Monk heals on my 90, all proving grounds does is say &quot;you suck&quot; No benefit to me over failing thru LFR<br>
Proving Grounds currently just &quot;tests&quot;, it doesn&apos;t &quot;teach&quot;. That&apos;s something we hope to change in the future. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422868523665211392))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
&apos;scuse me could you shed some light on a little red dragon named Andrestrasz? Is he a tribute, a memorial, something else...?<br>
I believe that commented earlier that he was a tribute, but wasn&apos;t sure. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422920126875185152))<br>
I&apos;d bet $20 it&apos;s a homage to someone&apos;s 5 yr old named Andre but would have to dig into data to find out for sure. (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/418534750022668288))<br>
