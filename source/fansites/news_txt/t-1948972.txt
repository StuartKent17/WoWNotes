Legion - Crashes on Ability Use
Hey everyone,
Wanted to give a brief update to let you all know that we're well aware of class abilities and spell rotations causing critical error crashes. The problem has been identified and a fix should be on it's way to you all in the next few hours. Thanks Alpha friends for all of the reports!

Good news everyone!

We just deployed a binary hotfix to resolve the crashes. Your Battle.net app should pick up the change as soon as you close Legion. As always, thanks for your patience!


Legion - Mac Clients Not Launching
Hey everyone,
Looks like an old bug has made it's way into the Alpha and we're actively investigating solutions for our friends on Mac. It's probably going to require a little bit of patching so there's no ETA yet. Thanks all, and as always, we appreciate your patience and diligent reporting.

With the latest binary deploy, Mac users should be good to go. The Battle.net app should automatically apply the fix. Thanks for your patience everyone!


FEEDBACK: Maw of Souls Normal
Please use this thread to post any feedback on the Maw of Souls dungeon. When posting, please note your group composition and any relevant information about the nature of your group e.g. random LFG group, Mythic raider guildmates, etc.. At this stage, a lot of overall combat balance is in flux, but we're still very interested in hearing overall feedback and impressions of the experience and mechanics.

Do you guys deliberately design classes to have significantly higher AoE or single target DPS than others?
How a spec AoEs is a major part of its identity. Different methods of AoE can be better or worse in different situations. WarcraftDevs

Can we get any word at all on Bear tank aoe? Disturbed at how little notice this seems to be getting!
There are several changes to the Bear rotation in the next build. We look forward to feedback on their new rotation, then! WarcraftDevs 

Lore
Hello, I'm slightly confused about something. Fel is called a substance and Sargeras is the God of Fel per UVG. So, Fel belongs
Fel is the primal force of chaos. It can pool into a green goop when it's in physical form. DaveKosak 

 will there be more peaceful story to Warcraft? Garrosh is dead, let faction war die with him. FOR AZEROTH
I worry that "PeaceCraft" wouldn't prove to be as popular and enduring. Then again - maybe it's the game the world needs. DaveKosak 


Make-A-Wish® Charity Pet: Thank You!
Thanks to the incredible out-purr-ing of generosity from World of Warcraft players around the globe who purchased Brightpaw the Mana Kitty, we’ve raised more than $1.7 million to benefit Make-A-Wish®, helping them grant the wishes of children throughout the world with life-threatening medical conditions.

Last year, we announced that during the month of December, 100% of Brightpaw’s purchase price would be donated to Make-A-Wish—and the WoW community rose to the occasion to lend their support. Thanks again for helping to make a difference in the lives of children.
