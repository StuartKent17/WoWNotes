Pocket Fel Spreader http://www.wowdb.com/items/140363-pocket-fel-spreader

Check Group Finder for a group that is farming the item.
Use a Demon tracking mechanism Spectral Sight http://www.wowdb.com/spells/188501-spectral-sight, Track Demons http://www.wowdb.com/spells/19878-track-demons, or Elixir of Detect Demon http://www.wowdb.com/items/9233-elixir-of-detect-demon

Glacial Spike Hotfix
Glacial Spike on its own is not a problem. It requires a good deal of setup including 5 frostbolts and a 3 second cast time to get off. We want something like that to have good payoff. The problem is the synergy between Deep Shatter, Ice Form and Glacial Spike. The intent of the Deep Shatter talent was to make your Frostbolts feel powerful. It wasn't intended to make Glacial Spike deal 2 million damage.

We've made a hotfix change to Deep Shatter. Icicles will no longer benefit from the extra damage from Deep Shatter. We think this change allows both Deep Shatter and Glacial Spike to feel powerful on their own.

Thanks to everyone who brought this issue to our attention through playtesting.

how is 300k a good pay off
I know where you are getting the 300k number from and it's possible there are more things at play than just the nerf. Our intention is that a Glacial Spike can hit in the 700-900k range at level 110 with proper setup. But when paired with Deep Shatter, it was possible for Glacial Spike to hit in the 2 million range. Since players have somewhere in the area of 2 million health, this is unacceptable. We like setup and high payoff, but we do not want spells that deal 100% of a player's health in battlegrounds and arenas.

If spells have a lot of setup and counterplay, we're comfortable with them doing damage in the 700k-900k range. If a spell has little counterplay but perhaps a long cooldown, we can see it hitting in the 400-500k range. Hopefully those numbers can serve as reference when giving feedback.

But to be clear, 2 million is way out of bounds and to suggest it is okay feels a bit disingenuous. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/587913-glacial-spike/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20748195472?page=3#42

Will DHs be able to loot world boss mounts? They aren't listed in the journal as possible loot for them & no loot from Sha/Nal.
should be able to yes Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/762483028513783808

World Events
Praying for an answer: Dalaran over Karazhan on the 9th too?
Still in-transit during the week, pops in the week after. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/762704886198743041

Does that mean there will be more questlines unlocked in the coming weeks? Or did I read that wrong?
.New quests every week leading up to launch, featuring Magni, Khadgar, Ulduar, Karazhan, and a mobile Dalaran. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/762707538370367488

If Broken Shore is pre-patch, does this mean that "Legion Launch" is simply the teleport from old dalaran to new + onward?
Correct, 8/30 Launch Night begins with an in-game sequence showing Dalaran blink to the Broken Isles. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/762710219788918784

If I can't play during the last week before Legion launch, will I miss the last quesline?
.You can go back and experience it at any time by talking to Archivist Elysiana in Dalaran in Broken Isles. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/762732885828784128

Since you can skip the Broken Shores intro now, any plans on being able to get the gear from the quests that were skipped, too?
You can go back and do the skipped intro quests at any time. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/761555678632620033

Servers
are you concerned that with all these servers merged, when Legion launches, the game will crash due to do many people?
Servers aren't merged, nor are they technically CRZ'd anymore, it's new tech that creates "shards" as necessary. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/762771150371860480
Goal is much more stability and on-demand area creation/population stabilization. Had a few kinks to work out, but v. cool. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/762771343993556993

PvP
Since people won't be able to get full artifact traits before tournaments, why allow artifacts at events then? Holinka
"Tournament Rules" War Games grant fully powered up Artifacts. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/761782241802399744
