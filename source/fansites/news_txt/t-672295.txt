I had to rush the video a little because of the official preview posted a few hours ago but ... here it is, a fairly complete preview of the Icecrown Citadel, the raid instance introduced with patch 3.3.

Keep in mind that some of the monsters and objects are missing and the instance will look nicer on live servers.

Note on the Frozen Throne - The Frozen Throne is also obviously a work in progress. If you think that the area looks small I would also like to point out that during the Blizzcon, developers clearly said that some of the floor would collapse during the fight. Destructible objects can't be displayed in the video and it will most likely look VERY different when you finally get a chance to meet Arthas.
