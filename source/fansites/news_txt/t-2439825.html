Forbes Interview with Ion Hazzikostas on Battle for Azeroth&apos;s Launch<br>
Forbes sat down (https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2018/10/10/the-state-of-warcraft-ion-hazzikostas-post-mortem-on-the-battle-for-azeroth-launch/#348c154cc194) with Ion Hazzikostas to discuss the launch of BfA and hot topics from the community.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
The team has enjoyed seeing the millions of people dive into the world of Battle for Azeroth.<br>
Ion admits that there was some major issues at launch such as the auction house lag and the Legion Mythic + data carrying over to the first week of BfA Mythic +.<br>
When they introduce major new systems, there&apos;s a lot to learn in terms of player feedback, from the beta to seeing millions of people interacting with them in a much more real way.<br>
The team is actively trying to bring Azerite Traits in line with each other via Hotfix.<br>
The &quot;we told you our issues during beta&quot; criticism is always tricky because there are many different people with many different opinions and play styles doing a variety of different content. It is impossible to please everyone, but they are always listening.<br>
Things like long ramp up times for Shadow Priests and Feral Druids are major concerns because it essentially does make them irrelevant for the environment of Mythic +, and the team recognizes that as a problem.<br>
The team makes sure that the core systems of the expansion are polished and ready to go, but realize that they can&apos;t delay an entire expansion for millions of players if a specific class or spec is not perfect.<br>
Ion never said that the classes were not complete in the Q &amp; A in which he said certain specs needed to wait for a patch to get adjustments, just that some of them needed to be adjusted and looked at still.<br>
The truth of the matter is that classes are never complete in WoW and are always being adjusted and iterated. Often times changes in beta require other unforeseen additional changes in live.<br>
The team recognizes that pressing several abilities on the global cooldown that do nothing but buff your character is not good gameplay and plan to address it (such as with frost death knight). They want to further develop classes so that these abilities do more than just buff.<br>
Gameplay hasn&apos;t necessarily slowed down so much as whenever a new expansion launches stats have to be brought down as a character levels in order to stop characters from getting ridiculous stat percentages.<br>
The team&apos;s top priority as of now is getting out content consistently and working on the Azerite System and the feel of Island Expeditions.<br>
Azerite Armor was easily accessible in early game, but the team realizes that it became hard to acquire as you progressed in item level.<br>
They are looking at how they can improve delivery of Azerite armor to get it into player&apos;s hands without also just having a loot hose where suddenly everyone is drowning in the stuff and it doesn&apos;t feel like it&apos;s even a reward anymore. They want to find a happy medium.<br>
The team wants the Azerite powers to be more than just an externally solved math problem and give decisions such as what is most enjoyable for gameplay.<br>
The team likes some sort of mystery that requires players to solve such as with Reorigination Array. They like to see players figuring out that this special buff takes 3 bosses per week to upgrade and that it basically happens organically as you raid.<br>
The team recognizes that they could have done a better job explaining the different phases that happen during Warfront progression.<br>
The team also recognizes that they should have explained the changes to the amount of loot rewarded from your weekly cache before BfA went live.<br>
The team still wants Island Expeditions to be the best way to obtain Azerite and will continue to iterate on Island Expedition rewards as a whole.<br>
They want Island Expeditions to feel more like questing and exploring in the world while leveling, meaning more clear roads and camps that lead to quests and objectives that are more dynamic.<br>
The main source of pride for this expansion is the art team and the world that they created.<br>
The team is happy with how War Mode turned out as well as the dungeons and raid.<br>
It was awesome to see the race for Mythic World First.<br>

Play with the Blues - Darkshore Warfront<br>
You can help test the Darkshore Warfront with the Blizzard Devs tomorrow at 1 PM Pacific!<br>
Tomorrow - Friday, October 12, starting at 1 PM Pacific (4 PM Eastern) - many members of the World of Warcraft design and QA teams will be hitting up the PTR to test the new Darkshore Warfront being added in Tides of Vengeance!<br>
<br>
This initial test will feature the Alliance version of the Warfront. For testing purposes, it&apos;ll be accessible to characters level 110 to 120, and be forced active for the duration of the test regardless of the state of the Darkshore zone. We&apos;ve also added an extra Warfront table to Stormwind to help newly-created PTR characters get in on the test easier, and sped up the overall cycle (again, to aid with testing).<br>
<br>
Your participation is invaluable at this stage of development for the new Warfront, so we&apos;d love to see you join us tomorrow as we put it through its paces. Thank you!<br>

Join The Great Gnomeregan Run&#x2013;October 13!<br>
Are you a gnome? Do you know a gnome? Would you like to BE a gnome? (And who wouldn&#x2019;t?) Then rise UP to the challenge of The Great Gnomeregan Run on Saturday, October 13 from Gnomeregan to Booty Bay.<br>
<br>
Where: Beginning outside the gnome starting area and ending in Booty Bay<br>
Who: Alliance-Only (Don&#x2019;t worry, Horde can create a level 1 gnome and join in the fun too.)<br>
<br>
Whether you&#x2019;re a level 1 gnome (highly encouraged), a level 71 human, or a level 110 draenei, you&#x2019;ll be able to join in this fun run beginning in the gnome starting area, winding through Dun Morogh, Ironforge, the Deeprun Tram, Stormwind, Elwynn Forest, Duskwood, and Stranglethorn Vale where the run culminates in Booty Bay.<br>
<br>

<br>
It&apos;s a big big BIG world out there, but don&#x2019;t worry about getting lost, there will be course markers and spectators along the way to help keep you on track. You&#x2019;ll even see a few familiar faces among the onlookers!<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Stranglethorn Vale is a dangerous place for low-level characters so you may want to find some muscle to join you along the way for a little extra protection. If you&#x2019;re a higher-level character, think about playing chaperone for a gnome.<br>
<br>
Whether short or tall, it will be a good time for all.</div></div>
