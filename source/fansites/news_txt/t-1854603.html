Arena Skirmishes Bonus Weekend August 28 - 31<br>
Next week is the Wrath of the Lich King timewalking event. Patch 6.2.2 and the new Timewarped Badge system will be live by then as long as nothing changes!<br>
Through the end of the day on Monday, Arena Skirmishes award triple bonus honor. There&#x2019;s never been a better time to queue up for the Arena and crack some skulls. Keep an eye out for the event-only quest The Arena Calls. When you win 10 Arena matches, the quest awards 500 Conquest Points which do not count against your weekly Conquest Point maximum.<br>
<br>
In case you&#x2019;ve never participated in an Arena Skirmish, here&#x2019;s an easy how-to guide:<br>
<br>
<br>
From anywhere in-game, open the Group Finder (default hotkey: i)<br>
Select the Player vs. Player tab on the bottom of the window.<br>
Under Arena Battles, choose either 2v2 or 3v3.<br>
Click the Join Battle button to be matched up with teammates. <br>
<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s Arena PvP! Rush in and bash your opponents.<br>
<br>
Will you answer the call to battle?<br>

In-Game Events<br>
<br>
Darkmoon Faire Returns [September 6-13]<br>
The wondrous and mystical Darkmoon Faire returns to Azeroth on September 6, and if you haven&#x2019;t completed all of Silas Darkmoon&#x2019;s new Darkmoon Races, now&#x2019;s the time! Test your speed and agility on a variety of racing mounts as you dodge electrifying obstacles and zip all over Darkmoon Island for rewards and achievements.

The faire continues to be one of the best ways to acquire heirloom gear, and don&#x2019;t forget all of the toys, mounts, and pets that can only be gotten here. Get in that cannon!<br>
<br>
Pirates&#x2019; Day [September 19-20]<br>
Every year on this one day, Captain DeMeza lands at the goblin town of Booty Bay in Stranglethorn Vale, attempting to recruit land-lubbers into her buccaneer ranks. Don&#x2019;t miss your chance to visit her or her henchmen in the capital cities. New for this year is the Big Bag of Booty. Be the Robin Hood of pirates by purchasing this one-time-use item which you can toss into the streets to help distribute piles of gold to those most in need. Yarr!<br>

<br>
Brewfest [September 20-October 6]<br>
Celebrated by both the Horde and the Alliance, Brewfest is a time to enjoy the fermented fruits of the harvest: pretzels, cheese, and brew! The competing breweries Thunderbrew, Barleybrew, and the Ogres, all come together outside of all the major cities in a bid to outdo each other with their special ales, meads, and beers. Brave adventurers are invited to sit back, take a pull, and sample the finest wares these brewers have to offer!<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Brewfest is your only chance to acquire the Swift Brewfest Ram and Great Brewfest Kodo mounts, as well as the Wopertinger and Pin-Sized Pink Pachyderm pets. It&#x2019;s also your chance to get your brew-covered mitts on a few new items: the Stout Alemental pet, and the Steamworks Sausage Grill and Brewfest Banner toys!<br>
<br>
Harvest Festival [September 21-28]<br>
The Harvest Festival is a time to commemorate those who have sacrificed their lives to help their allies. Throughout history, many have given their lives to that end. Every year, members of the Horde and the Alliance set aside time to honor the memories of the fallen, and to pay tribute to those whose memories are held most dear: Uther Lightbringer, for the Alliance, and Grommash Hellscream, for the Horde.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Members of the Alliance show their respect by lighting a candle at the Tomb of Uther Lightbringer in the Western Plaguelands. while members of the Horde show their respect to Grommash Hellscream by leaving a bottle of spirits at the base of the Hellscream Memorial in Demon Fall Canyon in Ashenvale.<br>
<br>
But your determination to pay respects to the dearly departed doesn&#x2019;t stop there! Show your patriotism by earning a new Spiritshard which will transforms you into an Anxious, Vengeful, Forlorn, or Peaceful spirit. It&#x2019;ll be your chance to truly feel the emotions of those who have paid the ultimate price.<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
PvE<br>
.Does LFR Archimonde drop the Ring upgrade?<br>
No, Crystallized Fel is only available on Normal difficulty and above. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/636283033914466304))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
The biggest difference with ranked solo queue would be having a rating attached and MMR.<br>
Keep in mind conquest does not exist in 7.0. Skirmish will provide honor and gear. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/635942319280099328))<br>
I would certainly love to hear more ideas about how we can improve Ground Finder too. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/635954384933793793))<br>
One common misconception about ranked solo queue is &quot;I will only get great teammates!&quot; (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/635954754833616896))<br>
<br>
But those good geared players do queue rated solo queue<br>
The reward systems are different in 7.0 (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/635962117334564864))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Can I ask you, how much has the WoW team changed since WotLK?<br>
Not much. The leadership team stayed virtually the same the whole time I was there. Some folks went to Titan and several came back. The team was growing the entire time so you always saw a lot of new faces, but they were additions, not replacements. Reading between the lines a bit, I don&apos;t think this is one of those deals where some kind of new team radically evolved the philosophy. Blizzard turnover, even between teams, is very low by industry standards. <br>
<br>
Why do Blizzard devs think anyone who disagrees with their direction or believes previous iterations of WoW were superior are blinded by rose colored glasses?<br>
I can&apos;t speak for them, obviously. I will say as a game developer on a long-running game such as LoL or WoW or even Age of Empires, you tend to hear in about roughly equal proportions &quot;this feature is flawed and stale, please update it&quot; and &quot;this feature was better before, please revert it.&quot; Thus, it&apos;s possible to often feel like you are fighting nostalgia, which might make you perceive it even when that isn&apos;t the player&apos;s specific feedback at the moment.<br>
<br>
You don&apos;t tend to hear &quot;this feature is perfect, please don&apos;t change it,&quot; because content customers don&apos;t tend to post on social media, but you hear plenty of &quot;this feature was perfect - why did you change it?&quot; <br>
