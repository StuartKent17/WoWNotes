Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons: Gladiator's Sanctum
Today we are taking a look at the final Medium building, the Gladiator's Sanctum. You can find the other Medium building previews in the Warlords of Draenor menu above this post.

The Gladiator's Sanctum  takes up a Medium plot which can also be used for a Lumber Mill , Barn , Trading Post  or Inn / Tavern  Once upgraded to Tier 3, your garrison will have two Medium plots available.

Abilities
This building is good for PvP perks, achievements, and titles.


Level 1 - Increases your out-of-combat regeneration in outdoor Draenor zones and allows the collection of broken bones from defeated enemy players used for Conqueror's Tribute.
Level 2 - Enables safe fall and underwater breathing in outdoor Draenor zones. Also enables the Nemesis quest series for defeating enemy players of specific races.
Level 3 - Show your might over opposing hostile players across Draenor and hone your strength on the blood-soaked arena floor. Slay your enemies and return with proof of their demise to earn powerful tributes! 



Level 3 Unlock
The Level 3 version of this building is unlocked by completing the The Bone Collector  achievement, which requires you to collect 4,000 Broken Bones  from killing players.


Work Orders
The Gladiator's Sanctum allows you to collect Broken Bones  from killing players, with ~4 earned per kill. You can then trade 10 of these bones for Gold, Honor Points, and Conquest Points. 


  


Training Dummies
This building has multiple DPS training dummies, as well as a Healer training dummy.


    


Highmaul Coliseum
Upon unlocking the Level 3 building, you can queue for Highmaul Coliseum. The Coliseum is a scenario that has a large number of players that participate in free for all PvP to the last man standing. If the fight goes on too long, the environment may finish it for you.

The winner gets The Last of Us  achievement, along with a title and some items. If you didn't win, you will get some mail with a Highmaul Lockbox , which has a chance for an item level 620 PvP item, Apexis Crystals, some honor, or other things.

You fought well...
For a complete failure. Perhaps this box of trinkets will help you in achieving victory next time.

Try not to lose so badly again. Just remember that second place is first loser.

- Gharg

P.S. It might also just be a box full of junk. Who knows?


Achievements
Many of these achievements reward a title for killing many players of another race. Once you select an enemy race , you cannot change to another until you have completed the selected one

Classes
Safe to assume some live tuning changes are aimed specifically at level 90 and will be re-evaluated at launch?
Tuning changes were made primarily but not exclusively for better 90 balance, but do affect 100. Will adjust at 100 as needed. Celestalon 

Character / Items
Wha!? I guess I only ever try mounting with the few shapeshifting items that aren't allowed.
If it has a mount anim, we're generally ok with letting you mount Muffinus 

What happened to the idea of account wide class mounts? It made it to the beta but never made it to live.
Class mounts are iconic parts of each class, in the same way that stag form and ghost wolf are emblematic of druid/shaman. Muffinus 

as you're pointing out "usable all year around" yourself, I hope some other holiday-only items change with time. Broom mounts?
We've discussed the broom before. It feels cool and unique being insta-cast, keeping it to the holiday keeps it from being OP. Muffinus 

Idea for next Hallow's End: Cosmetic witch hats!
This is a good idea. Muffinus 

How is the random stats/gems on items being affected while doing challenge modes?
Draenor gems and tertiary stats will have no effect in Challenge Modes. WatcherDev 

PvP
in season one arena = 180 conquest, so one arena skirmish should = 180 honour points or at-least half.
Skirmishes are not intended to have rated arena levels of efficiency. holinka 

In WoD, will random battleground wins reward Conquest points?
Yes holinka 

Lore
Do you have anything to say to someone like me who thinks the story and lore in AU draenor is lessened by the fact that it is AU?
It's also just a super interesting and epic setting that adds a lot of history and clarity to Outland, orcs and draenei. _DonAdams 
For all we know our Arakkoa could have a completely different history then the ones on AU draenor, for example.
My understanding is that the histories are the same up to the point where Garrosh arrives and begins mucking things up. _DonAdams 
They're not the same until then. Characters like Rulkan who was long dead 35 years ago in our timeline are alive on AU Draenor.
I would say Rulkan is an exception, not the rule. _DonAdams 
So if you folks wanted to expand on the stories of say the Arakkoa then you should've made a timeline split when Garrosh arrived.
It did split when Garrosh arrived. He's been there for at least several months before they open the portal to Azeroth. _DonAdams 
As for arakkoa, I wrote the WoD arakkoa lore and took care not to retcon. This is what they were before the first horde. _DonAdams 

World
so can we expect a fix next year? I think we all respect the tech side. Just frustrating that Ally is overlooked again.
Respectfully, you weren't overlooked. I worked on this content in Cata, and specifically tried to make Ally one just as cool. _DonAdams 
It has been this way for almost 4 years, and only now am I seeing reports about the flagging issues. Crappy bug, want to fix. _DonAdams 
But it has nothing to do with Alliance content being somehow less cared about or overlooked. It's not fair to insinuate that. _DonAdams 

Yes saw that, I still feel that making a change that harms actual players because of bots or exploits is like fixing 1/2
Again, the intent isn't to harm players farming mobs, it's to let us grant you XP for things we couldn't before. Muffinus 
But only once through as you said. It should be all that it should grant at level. Your bot/exploit problem shouldn't impact me.
That's the goal! No impacts for your normal playing experience! Muffinus 


End of Beta Event
We had a lot of fun over here with today's event, I hoped you all did too.

On behalf of the World of Warcraft Quality Assurance team, I want to thank all of you for helping us test the Warlords of Draenor expansion. You folks were invaluable throughout the beta in providing feedback and helping us track down important bugs before we go live next week. I loved interacting with you all on the forums, in-game, and on twitter; you're a great bunch of people!

Thanks again! See you all in Draenor!
