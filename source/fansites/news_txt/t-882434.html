In patch 4.1 we&apos;ll be introducing Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms, a new system intended to lower queue times. Call to Arms will automatically detect which class role is currently the least represented in the queue, and offer them additional rewards for entering the Dungeon Finder queue and completing a random level-85 Heroic dungeon.<br>
<br>
Any time the Dungeon Finder queue is longer than a few minutes for level-85 Heroics, the Call to Arms system kicks in and determines which role is the least represented. In the case of tanking being the least represented role, the &quot;Call to Arms: Tanks&quot; icon will display in the Dungeon Finder UI menu where class roles are selected, and will also display on the UI when the queue pops and you are selected to enter a dungeon. Regardless of your role, you&apos;ll always be able to see which role currently has been Called to Arms, if any.<br>
<br>
Call to Arms is meant to lower wait times by offering additional rewards for queuing as the currently least represented role. To be eligible for the additional rewards you must solo queue for a random level-85 Heroic in the role that is currently being Called to Arms, and complete the dungeon by killing the final boss. Every time you hit these requirements (there is no daily limit) you&apos;ll receive a goodie bag that will contain some gold, a chance at a rare gem, a chance at a flask/elixir (determined by spec), a good chance of receiving a non-combat pet (including cross faction pets), and a very rare chance at receiving a mount. The pets offered come from a wide variety of sources, and include companions like the Razzashi Hatchling, Cockatiel, and Tiny Sporebat, but the mounts are those specifically only available through dungeons (not raids), like the Reins of the Raven Lord (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/item/32768) from Sethekk Halls, Swift White Hawkstrider (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/item/35513) from Magister&apos;s Terrace, and Deathcharger&apos;s Reins (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/item/13335)from Stratholme.<br>
<br>
This system is meant to address the unacceptable queue times currently being experienced by those that queue for the DPS role at max level. The long queue times are, of course, caused by a very simple lack of representation in the Dungeon Finder by tanks, and to some extent healers. We don&apos;t feel the tanking and healing roles have any inherent issues that are causing the representation disparity, except that fulfilling them carries more responsibility. Understandably, players prefer to take on that responsibility in more organized situations than what the Dungeon Finder offers, but perhaps we can bribe them a little. While this system gives tanks and healers something extra, the incentive is being provided so that we can help players in the DPS role get into more dungeons, get better gear, and continue progressing.<br>
<br>
While the gold, gems, flasks, and elixirs are OK incentives, we knew we needed something more substantial. We had briefly considered Valor Points and epics, but decided that wouldn&apos;t be working toward the goal of helping DPS players progress, and ultimately wouldn&apos;t keep tanks and healers in the Dungeon Finder system for very long. We settled on pets and dungeon-found mounts as they&#x2019;re cosmetic/achievement items that players tend to try to get on their own, so why not change that up and offer them a chance to get some of those elusive pets and mounts in a way that also helps other players? Even if they don&apos;t get a pet or mount, or get one they already have, the gold and other goodies still feel rewarding enough that it won&apos;t feel like a waste of effort.<br>
<br>
We think it&apos;s a pretty solid incentive to get tanks and healers queuing, give max-level players another way to collect the pets and mounts they so desire, and above all, to improve wait times for DPS players sitting in queues. In the case of lower level dungeons, it&apos;s actually not uncommon for DPS to be the least represented role, and so if this new system works out and we&apos;re pleased with the results, we may consider applying this same mechanic to lower level dungeons as well.</div></div>
