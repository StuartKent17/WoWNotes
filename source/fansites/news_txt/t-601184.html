You can also check the profession preview here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=82.0).<br>
<br>
Druid Epic Flight Form<br>
The Druid Epic flight form will be available through a series of quests, similar to the Warlock and Paladin Epic mount quests before it. This quest series will also open up a new boss in Sethekk Halls, and ultimately to the epic flight form. <br>
<br>
Ethereum Prison<br>
Players in good standing with the Consortium will be tasked to deal with the most recent activities of the nefarious Ethereum. With new quests, items, and content for the solo and small-group level 70 player, the Ethereum Prison will be the proving grounds for many aspiring to greatness.<br>
<br>
Skettis<br>
The Skyguard, Sha&apos;tari warriors specializing in their command of the skies above Shattrath, have taken the offensive directly to the Arakkoa capital city, Skettis. Perched high in the mountains of Terrokar, and only accessible with use of a flying mount, Skettis holds new and exciting content for the solo or small-group level 70 player. All new quests, 5-person bosses, rare and epic items, and a new type of flying mount await those willing to lend their sword or stave to the battle. <br>
<br>
Nether Drake<br>
The Netherwing faction and quest line continues and the long awaited Nether Drake becomes available. The Nether Drake is a special 280% speed epic flying mount that is obtainable through solo and small-group play. The quest to obtain one will be difficult, but the reward will surely show your dedication to the Netherwing cause as you soar through the skies of Outland on your very own ethereal drake. <br>
<br>
Ogri&apos;la<br>
The Ogre plateau of enlightenment opens to those who prove their worth in Blade&apos;s Edge Mountains. Level 70 players will be able to help the Ogres of Ogri&apos;la battle invading forces and engage in new and exciting quests, such as a repeatable and ever popular bombing-run, this time using your own flying mount but with a dangerous twist! Featuring tons of new quests, the Ogri&apos;la faction, 5-person bosses, and rare and epic items, Ogri&apos;la is a place we&apos;re hoping all will aspire to enter.</div></div>
