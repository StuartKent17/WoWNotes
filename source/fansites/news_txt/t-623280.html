Update - Wrath of the Lich King is now available on both US and EU servers !<br>
Update - Realm Compensation (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/12665776606-realm-status-update.html)<br>
Update - Death Knight creation bug - This is a known issue. Please try creating a new level 1 character on the realm first, and then a Death Knight. You may also need to restart your game client. (Source (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=6848295014&amp;sid=1))<br>
Update - Upgrading for Wrath of the Lich King - To ensure a smooth transition to Wrath of the Lich King, we recommend that players who have newly upgraded their accounts, log into the game and log out completely for a short period of time in order for their account to fully update.

Wrath of the Lich King - Talent Calculator<br>
The Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/) has been updated for the launch of Wrath of the Lich King ! <br>
<br>
The interface looks a bit nicer, most of the text links have been replaced by nice buttons<br>
Glyphs are now included in the template! Now that all the Glyphs are available in game it makes sense to add them to the calculator.<br>
Tons of new bugs have been added for your enjoyment. We&apos;ll fix them throughout the night but just like anything I launch it wasn&apos;t tested intensively before going live, the first 10 people who report bugs in comments are getting a hug.<br>
Just like the old talent calculator, it&apos;s not supposed to be compatible with IE6 and you will have to upgrade your browser (and make thousands of webmaster happy by doing it)<br>
<br>
Already known bugs include funny behavior of glyph tooltips (clicking will always work, your mouse cursor/item tooltip might just not update), you can report everything else. <br>
