A new build will be deployed on live realms soon, this new patch (Build 14480, most likely) will only contain bugfixes and update a couple of item tooltips of previously hotfixed items. <br>
<br>
It should fix a couple of annoying bugs that have been on live servers for a while (bugged tab targeting, etc), and hopefully it will open the way for Patch 4.3 on PTRs. <br>
We do have a fix for this ready, however, it will require a client-side patch to address. We&apos;re in the process of building a small patch to fix this and a few other issues which also need client updates. You&apos;re likely to see what we call a fast patch in the near future (a la patch 4.1.0A in recent past: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/patch-notes/4-1-0a).<br>

Unheeded Warning (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/59520/unheeded-warning/) proc changed from 680 Weapon Damage to 1900 Attack Power. <br>
Yes, it was recently changed via a hotfix. I was delayed a bit in updating the documented hotfixes and apologize for that. <br>
<br>
[...] In both PvP and PvE, it was scaling disproportionately for Feral druids, to the extent it&apos;s been more desirable than 4.2 items for a lot of players, including non-druids. We want the process of obtaining loot to still feel meaningful as new gear is released, so your character is still progressing in power along with the content to which the items are linked. This one just remained a little too good for its level and relative difficulty to obtain.

Blue Posters are back<br>
Sorry, it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve communicated anything about this. Our team has been very busy lately working on a lot of cool things, as well as finalizing plans for BlizzCon, but we&apos;re trying to keep our eyes on the forums as much as possible in the process. :) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/189387/tab-target) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2913052284?page=1#17)) <br>

Delay for Patch 4.2 Bugfix Patch<br>
The process of documenting, troubleshooting, and testing bug fixes is complicated and constant. We&apos;ve made many fixes since day one of patch 4.2&apos;s release, most of which could be done server-side. All the while we&apos;ve been working on fixes for bugs that can&apos;t be addressed without a client-side patch. But the process for creating a stable new patch build to address any known issues is certainly not as easy as I think you&apos;re implying.

<br>
Tab Targeting and 4.2 Bugfix Patch<br>
To be clear, we know it&apos;s an annoying issue and it&apos;s unfortunate that it went live. But as I spoke in another thread a while back (a portion of which someone quoted earlier in this thread), this is a relatively complicated issue. We haven&apos;t just been sitting on it all this time. We want to make sure the fix is good, while also avoiding throwing together a quick patch to address it at the risk of breaking other things.

Battlegrounds Matchmaking<br>
We think battlegrounds work best when people are able to get into them quickly.<br>
<br>
While the matchmaker starts out being stringent it fairly quickly loosens up its search requirements to get people into games within a reasonable amount of time. We could absolutely make it so limiting that it won&apos;t place you into a game until X, Y, and Z standards are equal and you could sit in queue for ... maybe ever, but as you still receive rewards for losing, and due to the (intended) quick nature of games, we don&apos;t feel that makes sense for how battlegrounds flow.<br>
<br>
Getting people in, playing the game, win or lose, and then quickly into the next match is what most players tend to want - and not long queue times or drawn out matches.

API - Application points and daily request limits<br>
Once again, mostly developer mumbo jumbo that most of you won&apos;t be able to understand but I feel it&apos;s important to give that kind of news some exposure if we want to see nice tools in the future.<br>
We&apos;ve received a few questions about how the daily request limit throttler works and I wanted to explain the point system we use for the API.<br>
<br>
First of all, every request we receive is associated with an application. Even when an unauthenticated request comes in, we create a temporary fake application with an id generated from the IP address of the request. Each application falls under an application level or type and each of those levels/types has an associated point value.<br>
<br>
Instead of throttling applications by the number of requests made, we look at the cost of the requests made. For example, requesting realm status information is very cheap, therefore has a reduced request cost compared to looking up a guild, which is more expensive.<br>
<br>
It doesn&apos;t make any sense to say what the exact cost of requests are because we regularly evaluate and tweak the cost of requests based on hardware, software and application usage. What I can do is give you some rough guidelines to use when making lots of requests to the API.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Requests that hit the data APIs and the realm status cost the least. These represent the baseline cost of a request.<br>
Characters are expensive to request, but we employ considerable caching to reduce this cost. They can be considered 3x the cost of the baseline.<br>
Guilds are expensive, especially fetching membership information. We cache as much as possible, but they still run about 3x the cost of the baseline.<br>
When you use HTTP last modified headers and get a cache hit (that is to say no information needs to be returned), the cost of that request is reduced to the baseline.<br>
Getting the list of AH dumps for a realm is cheap, so we&apos;ll consider it the same as the baseline.<br>
Downloading one of the generated AH dump files has no cost as it is generated offline and served as a static file.<br>
<br>
<br>
When an application, either anonymous or registered, spends more points in a day than it has available, based on the application type/level, the request is denied. <br>
