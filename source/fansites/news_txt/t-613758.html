<br>
In its current state, Naxxramas (25 Players) is only itemized with loot from the 10 Players version, that&apos;s why you didn&apos;t see any updates on them. However the achievement works perfectly and the guilds getting the Realm First kill on Kel&apos;thuzad will see their achievement broadcasted to the world. (Including players not in the same zone/continent)<br>
