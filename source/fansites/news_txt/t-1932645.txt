Legion - Thrall and Doomhammer
We found some interesting references to Thrall and Doomhammer. Unfortunately there isn't much more than what is below yet. Keep in mind that this is just a reference in an alpha build of Legion, not something final or officially announced. Spoilers below!

Keep your eyes on Thrall. He's wounded. He's like to kill himself down here and I don't want to be the one to tell his wife!
Doomhammer... it was like a dead weight in my hands. The elements were silent. It has been this way since I used it to slay Garrosh.

Spirits... hear my call... 
Are you the so-called "World Shaman?" Hah! You fight like a crippled pig. 

Hear me, elements of Azeroth.
Once, we walked as one. I abused your powers for my own personal vendetta.
Take back the Doomhammer! Grant it to one who is worthy.
Teach me, and again I will be your servant.


Legion - Shaman Artifact Intro
A little piece of the Shaman Artifact intro was also found, likely from the ending that takes place in your Class Hall.
We stand at the precipice of oblivion, but we do not stand alone. Come forward, shaman. 
Take your place among the circle, Farseer. The Earthen Ring is forged anew, and with it, we rekindle hope for this world. 
You are the chosen defender of Azeroth! May your wisdom guide this circle to victory, and may the power of your artifact crush those who would bring chaos to this land.

The elements have chosen you as their champion, $n. The artifact you wield is proof.
It is your destiny to lead the Earthen Ring against the Burning Legion. We need you. Do you accept this burden? 
Yes. I will be your Farseer!

From this map you may dispatch members of the Earthen Ring throughout the Broken Isles. Lead us to victory, Farseer!
This Astral Portal will return you to Dalaran whenever you wish, Farseer. I will keep it open so that you may return here any time.


Legion - Artifact Weapon Previews
Today we have the Elemental Shaman Artifact The Fist of Ra-Den  Several of the shields are missing still, so look for them after a new build.

How is Cheap Shot part of a rotation, surely its only a utility, stun button?
For CC purposes, it can be used as on a rotational basis. Itâ€™s not maximum DPS, but still commonly worth it for things like PvP. WarcraftDevs 

Wtf do you mean blind is gone? Why?? It's my fave Cc! It feels so cocky just to blind a mob. Like "No! Wait your turn!" :'
That was referring to Subtlety specifically. Different Rogue specs have different ways to CC. For example, you may like Parley. Celestalon 

Legion Shadow Dance is a letdown to some pvpers. Maybe let an active/passive effect? Passive is negated while on CD, thoughts?
I'd love to hear more about this feedback. People giving it: What frequency are you imagining for the proposed version? Celestalon 
No sane PvP'er wants to lose the ability to make plays like we can with Shadow Dance. Its just a bad idea.
Again, that's why I'm asking these questions. How are you imagining it will play out? There's clearly a difference. Celestalon 
The downside is not being able to do stuff on-demand, and positioning not mattering due to Shadowstrike.
So you're saying that you don't expect the proposed version will feel controllable? That's useful feedback. Celestalon

If there are no weapon drops in Legion, where will a enhancement shaman get his off hand weapon from?
Doomhammer grants shamans the power to form a second weapon from the elements! No need for any lesser weapon drops. WarcraftDevs 
Is it like a copy of Doomhammer or something else?
Here's an image of it next to Doomhammer! It's also on the Artifact blog here:  WarcraftDevs 

Will we be able to transmog over the Elemental weapons?
The weapons formed by your elemental powers will behave like normal weapons. You will be able to transmog over them. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
Will honor kills acquired out in the world contribute to prestige levels? Any support in legion for out of instance PVP?
Honorable kills in the world will reward Honor and can increase your Honor level. WarcraftDevs
