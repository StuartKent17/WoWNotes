PvP Hotfix - Demonic Gateway and Ruby Hare
It looks like we are getting a small hotfix to disable Demonic Gateway and Ruby Hare in rated PvP.

Azeroth Choppers: Ask the Bike Experts
For those of you keeping up with Azeroth Choppers, we recently introduced you to the Alliance and Horde teams here at Blizzard http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/13880482. Now we'd like to give you the opportunity to get to know the handpicked teams of bike experts that are bringing to life a pair of asphalt-kicking, World of Warcraft-inspired chopper designs.

If you have any questions for Paul Jr. and his crew about bike designs/fabrication, working with Horde and Alliance themes, the trials and tribulations they've faced in recent Azeroth Choppers episodes, or anything else along those lines, please share them here. Feel free to target your questions toward a specific team or individual designer too.

We'll be selecting interesting questions from the community and seeking out answers from the bike experts of teams Alliance and Horde over at Paul Jr. Designs.

You can learn more about Azeroth Choppers and view the latest episodes at AzerothChoppers.com http://azerothchoppers.com/.


Blue Tweets
Classes
Interested in the filtering of spell visuals. Will all major defensive and offensive CDs remain visible e.g. dark soul, pain sup
Pain Sup yes. Dark Soul, usually. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463107337259986945

Question: Now that Vengeance is being separated from DPS, will AoE Vengeance DR continue to stay as Resolve or be reverted?
Undecided yet. The reason we put it in does still stay valid. Many little hits are less threatening than few big hits. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463421154510647296

Will it be possible to turn off the spell culling? If you have a computer than can handle it you should be able to.
Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463799638990925824

What are some offensive/defensive cooldowns that you think have easy to read visuals? What ones get lost in the noise? holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463005497067446273
Shaman Ascendance is too flashy. Everyone can see it from a mile away, and your burst turns out to be worthless
Actually, Ascendance is a great example of a cooldown with a spell effect that perfectly matches its significance. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463761378449178625
Perhaps, and it might just be me comparing things to other burst - example, Tiger Eye Brew, which is hard to notice, in comparison
The fix here is to make make Tiger Eye Brew easier to read, not make Ascendance more obscure. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463762937182957568

How will Necrotic Plague interact with things like Chilblains?
It will apply Chillblains. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463376219698778112
Think the question is does stack increase apply the slow again or nplague actually make it harder to apply again
Ah, yes, it would apply Chillblains. Nothing to worry about there. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463400151617241088

Insuring I understand, Hunters designed for mobility fights. Standard single target always intended to be low DPS? Seems unfair.
Raid bosses aren't static target dummies; neither are enemy players. We balance classes for real PvE and PvP situations. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463126063951130624

Please explain why you are nerfing Touch of Karma in WoD ? 
We aren't. Touch of Karma is remaining exactly as strong as it was before. We just didn't double it along with player health. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/462720371326607360
Thx for the answear but you are nerfing TOK : it is reduced by 50% when other % health heals and absorbs are reduced by 25% !
You're looking at it as an absorb. We don't see it that way; we see it as a damage ability that happens to absorb too. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/462859863689682944

And Ret needs something Holy doesn't bring for RBG, cool, scalable for big groups and reliable. Like Solar, Grip, Knockback... 
Wary of adding a lot of unique utility to specific specs as we've seen how that has gone with PvE raid compositions. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463784135568261120

Current Mastery levels give so many vt ticks so it we never can run oom when 2+ vts are up. This and SFiend regen is gone in WoD
I think I already answer that concern. Mana will be a limitation on healing done, not on damage done. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463548238830645248

locks were never true tanks and would require them to rework a spec for the sake of an optional talent 2/2
Yep. Changes required to make Prot a real DPS are trivial compared to what's required to make Demo a real tank. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/462654490462535680

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior / Skills http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warrior / WoD Talent Calculator http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#E
Sorry if you've already answered this elsewhere, but what made you guys decide that Prot. Warrior dps should be in the game?
A Sword+Board DPS is a strong fantasy that a lot of players are interested in. B Required minimal changes to make. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/462653768308236288
Ultimately, it's an experiment, not a guarantee that we're going to go forward with it, or spread to all tanks. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/462653924072501248

In order of impact: CSmash glyph, Ignite Weapon, ZRage, ZStance, Shouts. Rage going the way of DPS caster mana? Boring
I think you may be confusing some customization options for mandatory gameplay changes. ZerkRage/Shouts changes raise the skill cap. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463398722802434048
Yes but are you gonna be rewarded for sticking to the more complex rotations?
Yes, but additionally I'd point out that Ignite Weapon is actually a more complex rotation. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463401150356525056

Is bladed armor gear expected to be sub-par to dps stat gear?
No, above par. Bonus Armor will be your most valuable secondary stat as a Gladiator. ie, same as Defensive Protection Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463793998960664576

Character / Items
So when 6.0 hits, will any heroic Siege gear be made into Mythic gear?
Yes - no change in item level or anything, just the green label to avoid confusion. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463719209671749632

Achievements
Will there be realmfirst achievements for reputation & challengemode like in MoP or are they also gone?
We'll likely keep those. The race to max level in particular is what encouraged and rewarded use of borderline exploits. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462379777672765440
Uhh the rep is just as toxic as the level rush lol might want to rethink that one.
I'm just speaking in general terms. That sort of rep achievement may not make sense at all in Warlords. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462409495109304320

with change coming to UBRS, will we still be able to achieve Leeeeeeeeeeeroy! after WoD drops?
That's a good question, not currently, but we will look into an alternative way for you to aggro 200 whelps Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/463520220691587072

PvE
I'm hearing that I can go straight from LFG stuff to CM to Mythic and that excites me greatly.Right now you can zone in on Heroic if you find someone with a Normal clear; we're just removing that hurdle. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462641736615882752
I would not recommend trying Mythic raiding without any raid gear, but you CAN try it. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462641525152022528

So some might still want to reach max level and preraid BiS in the first week the expansion launches right, like older launches?
Of course, competitive players will seek every advantage - I wouldn't expect anything else. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462648153691676674

So CM rewards NOT >/= Normal Raid Gear? As I understood, they were between Normal/Heroic Raid ilvl?
No, CM rewards roughly equal to Raid Finder loot. Imagine 476 epics in 5.0, for a more direct analogy. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462642344698073088

I'm still bitter that heirlooms have been gated behind a raid boss. Many altaholics don't raid. Just quest and explore
Don't think of these as true heirlooms, but as raid loot that stays useful to 100. We'll add real 90+ heirlooms in the future. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462643353151373312

Also I often hear: "Oh, crap let me go get my seals" in the middle of my raid. New system means they just go without.
Yeah, we're still working through a solve for that. Agree it's problematic if you have to do it all pre-raid each week. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462647038837272577

Why not make bonus roll tokens stay like they are now, where you buy up to 3/week with an uncapped currency?
We'll have more details to share on the specifics in the future - but that's more or less how it'll work. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462693576720121856

Getting a seal through garrisons officially makes the feature a chore for people who just want to raid.
Pretty sure you're misunderstanding. You'll probably turn stuff in to get your bonus rolls at your garrison. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462690720609218560
That's not the same as "doing garrisons" to earn them. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462690924381085696
Plz make sure we can get all tokens for the week on Tuesday, the wording in the interview worried me.
We will. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462708465371451393

Will we have more than 3 choices for our 3 seal quests? What if our garrison is under attack? That makes for a horrid Tues.
We're going to be very mindful of all those quality-of-life concerns. The goal here is more freedom, not less. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462674657595101185
No offense, but it doesn't feel that way. Feels inescapable treadmill + 3 long tasks for Tues on top of world boss before raid.
Right, I mean that we're not going to design the system such that you have to do all of that on Tuesday before you raid. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462676664242409472

that's what I like about the current system too. Nice to stockpile charms to have some 'time off' in future weeks
Exactly - we want to preserve that flexibility. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462701014454652928

Any plans to change heirlooms that become useless? Spirit mace for a spriest was my "spec" drop?
Yeah, Spirit on those weapons is being replaced since we know it has no effect for hybrid nukers. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462680401925124096

Are we going to see anything with normal raid lvl loot out of raid in WoD? Past had valor, craftable... now tuned to LFR?
There will be a bunch of systems garrisons, crafting, outdoor content, etc. that can yield items on par with Normal raid loot WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462811512290443264
WoD normal AKA Flex? In MoP craft/outdoor is normal AKA WoD heroic level gear. Is this nerf to craft?
...and some Heroic stuff at the high end. We're not nerfing those systems. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462974659307511808

Please confirm that there will be no more cut scenes like after Council in ToT, unskippable.
These are the hard-hitting questions that matter. Yes, there will not be any more unskippable scenes like that. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463037490082111489

Will we ever see a boss again even the best guilds can't beat for over a month? Is it still possible? eg Kael Yogg 0 H Lich King
Yogg-0 is valid, but it was viewed as a bonus and few were trying until Stars did it. Top guilds are pretty amazing nowadays. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463152137296678914
Kael was pretty much unkillable in 2.0; fixed in 2.1 and died shortly after. H-LK had limited attempts. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463151995298529280

Did Garrosh HC with 1 tank 1 healer, it's unfortunate that this is possible; could you please make the debuff not reset on whirl
Agree that it's unfortunate, but we're not going to make any changes that make the fight harder at this point. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463186175147393024

Raid Finder and Heroic Dungeons
New proposed LFR is very sad. It's really making me wish I never preordered WoD. Commit to a schedule or no tiered sets. Thanks.
With Group Finder you should be able to do Normal without any fixed schedule - that's an essential goal for us. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462975077810966528

Why will heroic 5 mans be harder than LFR yet give worse gear?
LFR entails a larger time commitment, has a weekly lockout, and requires more people, even if lower personal responsibility. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463174509001195520
This doesn't feel like it's solving the "LFR required" problem that's been persistent through MOP :\
Required for what, exactly? WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463340298903781376

alts also have zero option besides LFR, mains had it the best with that - if you kept up every tier
There will be a number of options for alts. If you really don't want to touch LFR, you won't have to. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463344495254568961
If you're hoping for it to be completely irrelevant under all circumstances, then sorry, that's not happening. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463344587759976448

That line about it's been difficult to look at a players gear & tell how awesome they are with shared art..So, LFR=Crap player?
No, but clearly less time investment and _proven_ skill than a Mythic raider, no? Same for Gladiator vs. someone w/ BG Honor gear. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462779056166301696
I can't believe I even defended this change as compromise. This LFR change is _proven_ as stroking the epeens of snowflakes.
The other side of this is improving the LFR experience which we need to do, and significantly increasing loot yield. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462797327275941890
Increasing loot yield=LFR players not interested in stepping up unsubbing sooner once they have all their gear. Sound business?
Honestly, I'd rather someone take a break until new content rather than leave frustrated after grinding for loot that doesn't drop WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462798735362506752
But of course we want to offer diverse content to appeal to players, that isn't tied to just ticking off a list of raid drops. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462798879730454528
There you go LFR people, if you're not interested in stepping up Blizzard are happy to see you unsubscribe, you have your answer
If that's what you got out of my reply, then I'm not sure where to go from there, sorry. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/462800085428883456

PvP
full geared one. if everyone was close to the same ilvl it would make more sense, better for competition instead of getting rolled
In Warlords we'll be increasing everyone's ilevel to a minimum point and dual ilevel let's us contract the spread a bit. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/462417038753796096

any plans to give treants a pet bar its annoying when someone ccs out of a root beam and the treant breaks it?
Not really. They are breaking with their wrath? What types of CC? holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/462479651609124865

.so skirmishes are back yay! but also for low level?
yes low level too! holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/462636808157659137

i've read that skirmishes will work with MMR, but their goal isn't to meet random-level people ? Tell me more please.
They'll have a minimum level of MMR for reasonable matchmaking, but the search will broaden aggressively to reduce queue times. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463504144376934401

I would say the pvp enchants have been a huge success in terms of appeal. Any chance wod will have them as well?
Agree they were popular and we'd like to do them again holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/462709283428110337

can you put cross realm bgs into skirmish in WoD so guilds or rbg teams can challenge guilds on other severs plz
Yes everything will be cross realm holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/462744617876611072

Same answer holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/462819845197676546

My only concern with spectator mode is arena/rbg coaches. Spectator keeps an eye out for important things the players may miss.
Spectator mode is only available for pre-arranged matches via War Games. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463062712671412225

With the changes 2 PvP coming in WoD, how are you going 2 balance 2 and 4pc PvE gear to work in PvP situations? Dont want it 2 OP.
typically PvP set bonuses couldn't benefit throughput but now they can compete with PvE ones. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463092699520696320

Will we be getting new & interesting PvP set bonuses? If so will they change each season or stay the same for the xpac?
Definitely new set bonuses to start the expansion. Every season could be interesting way to create flame wars each season holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463371141646540800

Short version: Less reliance on color shifts. The more awesome you are, the more awesome you look. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/462661366516441088
what of armor sets kind of progressed. How LK naxx gear was kind of an upgrade to vanilla naxx.
the elite and mythic sets will have various additions compared to the normal raid/conquest gear. Feels like an evolution. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/462750562526588928
are they just cosmeticelite PVP gear or is there finnaly a real power reward for higher rating?
Cosmetic. We don't like attaching power to rating. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463100233019187200

PvEers have a huge pool of gear to try and make a min-max set. PvPers only get one p/spec. Could we get more options pleeease? 
Yes we'd like to find ways to get more variety in the PvP gear. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463741736666140672

Will there be different ways of obtaining cutting edge PvP gear other than via arena grind in WoD?
Conquest gear will still come from doing Rated PvP, which we consider the toughest challenge players can face in WoW PvP. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463763261729431552
with the arena and rbg caps being equal couldn't you cap conq thru randoms? Or no more RanBG conq?
Yes you could, but it is very inefficient to do so. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463784218888134656

I'm not sure PvP gear needs > Mythic gear in WPvP. Time and effort to obtain much greater. Should probably equal PvP gear instead.
The difference in ilevel between Conquest gear and Mythic gear will be quite minimal maybe 5 ilevels. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463784733076226048

important pvp cast animations on opponent maintained I hope?
Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/463794081882062848

Ok, serious quesiton: How do I win a random BG or CTA that is not IoC or AV as alliance? Is it mandatory to find a premade now?
I've been winning EotS all weekend on my Alliance toons without a group. Not sure what to tell you. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463137430527152128

Best fun I had in game was in a tBC twink guildWent to Gurubashi on PTR to duelIs WoD PvP going to be a capture of twink culture?
We're not making any special efforts towards twinks in Warlords but we didn't specifically do things for twinks back then. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463507443738112001

Garrisons
Personally hate garrison idea. How inconvenient will it be to avoid them? Looks difficult to level etc without them.
What do you hate about it? WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463151672513265664
followers, profession buildings, customization, quests... Basically everything we've been told.
If you want no part of the garrison "minigame" followers, upgrades, etc. you can certainly opt out. Can't opt out of having one. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463158515247620096
but how much more difficult will it make things?
Hard to quantify, but we're trying to make the system a bonus. We'll have lots more info soon actual soon, not "SoonTM". WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/463170092696862720

Can you trigger a garrison attack? If not how often can they be?
