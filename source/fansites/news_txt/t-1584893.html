The Gaze of the Black Prince Returns for the Final Time<br>
Beginning Tuesday, September 2 at 10:00 a.m. PDT, through Tuesday, September 16 at 9:00 a.m. PDT, we&#x2019;ll be applying the Gaze of the Black Prince buff for the final time before the Warlords of Draenor expansion. This buff will increase the reputation gained with the Black Prince by 100%. It will also increase the chance of obtaining items from his foes needed as a part of the Legendary Cloak quest line including: the Secrets of the Empire (http://www.wowdb.com/items/94593-secrets-of-the-empire), Sigil of Wisdom (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87209-sigil-of-wisdom), Sigil of Power (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87208-sigil-of-power), or Titan Runestone (http://www.wowdb.com/items/94594-titan-runestone).<br>

Garrison Plots Count<br>
Overall our design philosophy is that a few meaningful decisions is better than lots of inconsequential ones.<br>
<br>
This is a video game. there shouldn&apos;t be any &quot;consequences&quot;. we should be able to do everything inconseqeuncially. thus we should be able to build everything.<br>
So no matter what button you push, it&apos;s always the best one? No matter what you do, you win? That&apos;s... horrifying. That&apos;s what you want video games to be? That&apos;s not a game. I&apos;m not sure what that is. <br>
<br>
All you&apos;re doing is turning the garrison from something fun that people can tinker and toy with into something that has to be min/maxed to the nth, leading to just everyone having the exact same garrison choices dependent on what they do in game. The AH tycoon is going to get the bank and AH, the raider is going to go with the bonus rolls, profession buildings are going to be determined by what you are rather than what you&apos;re missing, etc.<br>
Right. People will pick buildings that appeal to them based on what those buildings provide. You&apos;re stating the intended result as if it&apos;s unintended.(Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/336042-we-need-more-garrison-plots/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14057706579?page=6#118))<br>

What&apos;s the latest AoE capping rules? X for damage and Y for heals? Thanks.<br>
X=20, Y=6 (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505208849624608768))<br>
<br>
any reason ret loses INQ and gain massive dps increase from Seraphim but ferals still have to SR in their rotation? Seems weird<br>
Seraphim is a choice. Savage Roar can be glyphed, another choice. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505373892287160320))<br>
<br>
what class has given you the most difficulties when it came to balance?<br>
Hmm... Good question. Ones that have abilities that are all interconnected a lot, such as Shadow. Hard to change one thing... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505383768824512512))<br>
...without unbalancing something else. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505383848381669377))<br>
<br>
is the fact that pure DPS classes have more raid utility than a MW a concern?<br>
DPS and Healers aren&apos;t competing on utility. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505397617124462592))<br>
<br>
The adjustments to tanks that you hinted at,are these going to be for all tanks or pecific ones? Thanks!<br>
.All tanks. Current plans: Tweak the design of Resolve. Lower tank health. Lower tank mitigation. Lower boss damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505376690470916096))<br>
Active Mitigation was a really good step for enjoy playing like tank. If You nerf AM I hope to not return to the past<br>
AM is a great concept, and we&apos;re not planning to remove it at all. We&apos;ll be reducing both passive and active mitigation. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505432250016477186))<br>

from a PvE perspective what does Lunar inspiration bring. Its basically just a one time per duration shred filler?<br>
Ranged damage, an additional DoT to maintain, and combo builder. Like a ranged Rake. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505376323028914176))<br>
<br>
How are you guys feeling with Balance Druids? havent heard anything recently in any feedback etc!<br>
Generally OK. Might be a bit strong on the multidotting damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505383986261413888))<br>

can monks have chi orbs back in PVP they are much more fun then surging mists? that is all?<br>
They were extremely unintuitive, yet quite overpowered. Sorry. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505376051007344640))<br>
agreed but why surging mists what if we kept chi orbs but added a cast time that you can cast while running...<br>
That&apos;s even more unintuitive. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505390848813842432))<br>
<br>
Any chance of WWers getting a stackable utility cooldown? Hearing from Mythic teams that won&apos;t be bringing WW/MW due to this. <br>
Multiple Windwalkers not stacking their movespeed is a concern, but that&apos;s a really rare combo, currently. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505380468846788608))<br>
MW utility is where the real hurt is though. Devo Aura, Rebirth, Heroism, Guardian Spirit/PW: Barrier....what do MWers bring?<br>
Revival, for it&apos;s healing. Dispel is just a minor side benefit. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505392131767545856))<br>

what do you think about empowered seals?<br>
I think it&apos;s an interesting playstyle that many will enjoy, and many will hate. Good for a talent. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505382146689990656))<br>

thoughts on echo for enhance being too difficult to use with large haste sources? Especially lust/em. Decision tree very complex<br>
It is. Good for a talent. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505389125521133569))<br>
<br>
can enhancement get moving LB back? A cast time finisher makes us less mobile than other melee.<br>
No, that should be a niche use. It&apos;s ranged, has ranged pros and cons. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505393864686178304))<br>

current state of locks&apos; raid utility or lack thereof reminds me of BC rogues: no utility besides DPS. But our DPS= others&apos;.Why?<br>
Demonic Gateway has high raid utility, despite what some people say. Whole strats based around it all the time. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505379339018715136))<br>
<br>
Don&apos;t you feel that warlocks need fel flame back? To build up the last bit of an ember, demonology movement, affli dot refresh<br>
We don&apos;t. It&apos;s a challenge, but toning down caster mobility is better for the game. Balance. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505380771214159872))<br>
Then why are you toning down only warlocks and shamans? Why are fire mages with scorch ok?<br>
Scorch is primarily a movement tool; damage is trivial. Mobility is one way we differentiate specs. Like how Demo has high mobility (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505396119195889664))<br>

Is Gladiator Stance turning out how you guys planned?<br>
So far, yup. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505388734351966209))<br>
<br>
arms warrior, what can we expect? no softballs here! hopefully small repair on the ol&apos; car.<br>
A little less rage, no more Devestate/Revenge, Mastery buffs, tuning. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505379652484235265))<br>
no more devastate/revenge? Will we see the cooldown from swapping stances go away too then?<br>
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505390479715094528))<br>
<br>
At this point, they might as well remove Seasoned Soldier, and buff mastery per point by 33-50%<br>
Seasoned Soldier is a useful tuning knob. Mastery will be tuned on it&apos;s own (and is easy to do so). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505374231769931777))<br>
you keep saying this, but seeing as the big hits got neutered for pvp concerns have yet to see how it works.<br>
Arms damage tuning has been based on PvE performance. Mastery is the most easily tuned stat. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505381039863513088))<br>
does that mean the big hit concept is still goal?<br>
Yes, absolutely. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505392234699972608))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
with the removal of combat stats from profs. What&apos;re you doing to balance Engineering? As it becomes the clear must hav<br>
Engineering items that have notable combat benefit are becoming available to all. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505223316274024448))<br>
<br>
Proving Grounds<br>
Any info to share on the new proving grounds, different style? Or the same but upscaled<br>
In 6.0: Bronze available at level 30 and above. The NPCs scale to your ilvl instead of it downscaling your ilvl. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505393199406673920))<br>
Hope to do much more in the future. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505393250086445056))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
will people with bad pc&apos;s be able to raid 20 man, or are people who can&apos;t afford updated pc&apos;s gonna be stuck heroic?<br>
We&apos;ve been making some extremely impressive improvements to client performance, especially in raids. I hope you can! (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505382607006490624))<br>
<br>
Any plans to change spine of deathwing roll mechanic to make it less annoying to solo?<br>
Yes - in 6.0 it takes significantly longer for Deathwing to roll when unbalanced if there&apos;s only one player on his back. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/505401125227331585))<br>
Some changes planned for Thorim? Impossible for some without engineering. Have to bother someone just to wait in the arena.<br>
Yeah, no more death-ball when the arena is empty in 6.0. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/505411956912558081))<br>
