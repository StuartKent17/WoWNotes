Contest Winners<br>
so, did anybody win?<br>
Yeah! 110 people to be exact! As well as the person (and guest) that won the trip to BlizzCon.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re still finalizing some of the winners. Per the rules they have 10 days to respond to our email before we pick a new winner. Of course some people don&apos;t check their email, we pick a new winner, and sometimes they also don&apos;t check their email, etc. etc. this could go on for a long time... Plus the legal process for some of the larger ticket prizes requires physical documents being mailed back and forth. Long story short, we don&apos;t have a full final list of winners yet--although it&apos;s only a few stragglers remaining.<br>
<br>
Instead of posting all the winner&apos;s screenshots (111 of them)--not only because it&apos;s a lot of entries to post, but also because it was a sweepstakes, and not a judgment of the best screenshots--we&apos;re going to just be posting some of our favorites. We should have that up early next week if I were to guess.

be considered demonic souls...<br>
&quot;Infernal soul&quot; might also be a term used by the legion for a fabricated &quot;soul,&quot; which may not be the same as a life soul. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/618157031883567108))<br>
<br>
So locks are controlling the infernal soul that animates the infernals? Neato, I guess fel-corrupted elemental spirits could also<br>
I would consider those more fel-corrupted living beings, not necessarily demonic, just corrupted. Aberrations. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/618157277728608256))<br>
<br>
...aren&apos;t shaman heals just water spells?<br>
They used to be life spells! Now they are water. I think their res is still nature? I don&apos;t recall. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/618457224076070912))<br>
<br>
Pets and Pet Battles<br>
About battle pets, ever considered that the system might be getting a bit bloated? There are 14 rats, for example.<br>
Sounds like we need more cats (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/618497907453329408))<br>
