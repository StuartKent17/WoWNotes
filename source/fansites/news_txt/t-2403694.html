Lots of feedback on the first round of changes. Here&#x2019;s the second iteration:<br>
<br>
Pillar of Frost <br>
Previous changes to Pillar of Frost have been reverted. While the ability is quite simple in a vacuum (20% damage increase with no other mechanics), there were clearly a lot of players who were uncomfortable with the idea of removing a core ability that&#x2019;s been around for so long. <br>
<br>
After reading all the feedback and examining the ability&#x2019;s place on the spec, we think the ability did provide a couple valuable things to the Frost rotation. One is Pillar of Frost is a window to play around &#x2013; it allowed you to occasionally pool/spend your resources for a gain in a way that otherwise Frost doesn&#x2019;t really have baseline. Additionally, it was a damage amp that you could/would want to line up cooldowns for &#x2013; Remorseless Winter, Frostwyrm&#x2019;s Fury, etc. Straightforward, but felt good to use.<br>
<br>
Pillar of Frost is now back, at 45 sec cooldown and 15 sec duration &#x2013; shorter cooldown but same uptime. Since it&#x2019;s providing some useful gameplay direction for the rotation, we&#x2019;re leaning into it more and making it available a little more often. Additionally, to give it just a little more texture and gameplay, its damage bonus now starts at 15% and increases by 1% per Rune spent while it&#x2019;s active. Pillar usually ends with a 25% damage bonus or more.<br>
<br>
Talent Changes<br>
<br>
Glacial Advance now costs 30 Runic Power (instead of 1 Rune), has a 6 sec cooldown (down from 15 sec), and also applies Razorice to all enemies hit. Glacial Advance overlapped a lot with Frostscythe in both use and cost, and we&#x2019;re looking to differentiate it so it can find its own use case. Cold Heart has replaced Shattering Strikes. It&#x2019;s basically the same as the legendary but without the stun, and provides the spec&#x2019;s talent tree with some single-target burst. Obliteration is mostly back to its live design, but it&#x2019;s now a passive, and triggered while Pillar of Frost is active. With Pillar of Frost being back baseline, we still want to avoid a setup where casing 3 self-buff cooldown consecutively was possible (Pillar of Frost, Empower Rune Weapon, Obliteration, in any order). We&apos;re still iterating a bit on Obliteration&apos;s cost reduction mechanic - it has some slightly awkward effects on resources which we&apos;d like to make feel better.<br>
Current talent layout:<br>
<br>
Level 60: Avalanche, Frozen Pulse (now requires fewer than 3 full Runes instead of fewer than 2), Frostscythe Level 90: Gathering Storm, Glacial Advance, Frostwyrm&#x2019;s Fury Level 100: Icecap (same as live, affecting Pillar of Frost), Obliteration, Breath of Sindragosa<br>
Notes:<br>
<br>
Icy Talons now triggers from Breath of Sindragosa, since it&#x2019;s replacing your Frost Strike for a period of time. Icebound Fortitude&#x2019;s damage reduction was increased to 30% for both Frost/Unholy specs<br>
As always, thanks for the continued feedback and we expect to hear more from you all.<br>
<br>
<br>
End of Legion: PVP Feedback<br>
With Legion coming to a close we thought we might try something a little different and collect some specific feedback on things. We&apos;ve now covered Mythic+, and Mythic Raiding so its time to change it up!<br>
<br>
This week&apos;s topic is going to be about PVP over the course of Legion. BUT WAIT. While its easy to lump class feedback into the umbrella of PVP that&apos;s not what we&apos;re looking for here. We&apos;re looking for feedback more centered on PVP&apos;s functioning systems. This includes things like gearing, Arena and Battleground maps, rewards, rating systems, etc. <br>
<br>
Why the clarification to exclude Class Feedback?<br>
This is because if we didn&apos;t this feedback post would be almost impossible to read or evaluate. Those types of issues are far better as one offs that we can evaluate within those situational examples.<br>
<br>
Where is X topic?<br>
Don&apos;t worry as we have a list of topics that we plan on going down and its probably on the list. Every week will be a new topic so just give us a moment and we&apos;ll get there. <br>
<br>
What Topics have you covered already?<br>
We&apos;ve now covered Mythic+, and Mythic Raiding.<br>
<br>
Also a friendly note that just because you see it here doesn&apos;t mean it will be changed or added - and this topic is not an indication of future feature development.<br>

Battle For Azeroth Addon Changes<br>
Thanks for the feedback. While we have to limit the SendLoggedAddonMessage to UTF-8 that is viewable in WoW, we are adding a CHAT_MSG_ADDON_LOGGED event.</div></div>
