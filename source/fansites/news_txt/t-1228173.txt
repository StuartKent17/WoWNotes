Blue Tweets
Patch 5.1
Where is our unique anglers tabard, and where are our other water strider colors? 
Anglers tabard is a bug. We'll fix. Not sure we ever intended to make other striders available. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/263072257755209729

Questing
Remove class specific quest rewards? When none of the items are an upgrade, I would always chose the one that sells for most 
Okay, weapon costs still vary. We made all armor types the same cost. It used to be, you were dumb not to choose the plate one. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/262970910032666625

World
Isn't the fact that the fans want flying on silvermoon enough justification to do it? Will it ever get done or r u sayin never 
Say you were the game director on WoW. Would you spend art time on Silvermoon or a new raid? Not saying there's a right answer. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/262971103834689536

Draenei are the SINGLE most neglected race in the entire game. Even Forest Song didn't get a single upgrade. 
I don't know who is the "most neglected" but we have plans for Draenei. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/262733725148798976

Misc
Is it possible to make tab-targeting target the closest enemy in front of you instead of every totem, pet, critter and tree? 
Gotten that request a lot lately. We'll look at it. Could also do a mod-tab or something. 

Are the other members of SI:7 in Jade Forest dead? ie, Amber Kearnen Loved Amber. 
I believe Amber survived.

Oh and where is my bat mount? Bats have been taxis forever and it's still not a mount. Hook a forsaken up! 
We need a better looking bat model, but after that, for sure. 

"We are concerned about how money will we still get from servers transfers" There, i fixed that for you. 
Nah. It's better business to have the game endure a long time because players like it than to make a quick buck. 

Can you talk about possible reasons why you would not allow a choice between old and new player models? 
We might. That would be a good way to reduce the "looks great but not my guy" factor. 

Speaking of which, what's your opinion on "datamining"? Is it a good thing or just something you're forced to live with? 
Probably good overall. I wish players didn't accept it as truth. The miners usually caveat everything pretty well. 

Did you ever expect so many guilds to make optional addons "mandatory" parts of joining/playing the game? 
I would not have predicted that players would become so focused on efficiency. Not fun or improving themselves. Efficiency. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261362197857456128

Will upgrading gear though valor points be added in 5.1? Or will it be added later? 
The plan is 5.1. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261360678206590976

Why don't you go with smaller and more consistent patches? It feels like you need to be able to monitor changes btr? 
Informed players like many of you might prefer that, but for many players it feels like near constant class design churn. 
Is there a problem with that honestly? The quicker its tuned, the faster balance approaches, its how it works 
Believe it or not, a lot of players quit playing if we're in a state of always tuning classes, even if better balance is achieved. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261361561648656384

Is there any chance of the Motes/Spirits of Harmony becoming BoA in the future? 
Perhaps in a future patch. We like the way they are playing for now. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261149962644107264

What is going on with revamped character models ,having a hard time finding a blue post on forums 
We've said we're working on it, but it's a huge task with a lot of risk so it won't be anytime soon. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/260776065977446400

How about a search feature for the mount tab similar to non-combat pet tab, purdy please? 
Yeah, we'll do one. 

But arthas death is still a bit unresolved, whats up?
Unresolved? Dead as a doornail. Source https://twitter.com/ChrisMetzen/status/260421632307372032
I think what he means by "unresolved" is the whole "where is his body"
I know - I was dodging. Source https://twitter.com/ChrisMetzen/status/260425292479332352

Can you explain what "High King" really means? Does it mean Varian is above the other leaders, or something else? 
Much like the "Warchief" of the Horde, the High King is trying to coordinate the actions of all the races in the Alliance. 

Why can't I put my herbalism spade in my herb bag? My fishing rod goes in my fishing bag.
Great point! It has now been fixed for 5.1!
