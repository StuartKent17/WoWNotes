Patch 6.2.3 Hotfixes - March 15
Achievements

Fledgling Hero of Warcraft http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10657-fledgling-hero-of-warcraft: Fixed an issue where characters that reach level 20 while inside of an instance were not receiving credit for the achievement.



Blue Posts
Hearthstone Promo
1st: is the achievement in the game yet?
2nd: Do I need to level a character to 20 or can I get the achievement on this character ?
3rd: Does the character have to be a newly made character?

1. Yes
2. You need to level a character to level 20. The achievement isn't retroactive.
3. No, if you have an old character around that's lower than level 20, you can simply level that one. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/405078-questions-on-the-hearthstone-promo/ / Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17610911383?page=1#17

What is the intended design/use case for Soulgorge for Blood DKs? To more quickly stack Bone Shield w/ rune regen?
It adds an option for potentially more complex gameplay, and a more fast-based rotation. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705946119293923336

Powershift Macro doesn't work. "/cast !Cat Form" does nothing. On Live I can shift out and shift in back instantly.
We've added a cooldown on reentering a shapeshift form you just left. It's not a GCD, though, 1/2 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705945001327357952
so you're free to take any other action. 2/2 https://t.co/RRTowCIC4D WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705945047972220929

PvP
Are Artifact Talent Trees and PVP TalentsTtrees going to be fully complete in rated PVP content?
All Artifact talents will work in PvP. You will not be given them for free. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705947531750998017

Is the health and damage supposed to be so high? I really hope it'll get squished down to a reasonable amount.
Tuning is still ongoing, but the overall increase to health pools is intentional. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705953045834674177

will there be rewards for ashran in legion that are exclusive to ashranlike accolade trinkets?
