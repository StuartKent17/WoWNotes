Warlords of Draenor Stats<br>
Minor example is ratio of ambush bonus dmg to backstab bonus dmg is constant at all levels, but backstab scales better with gear<br>
You&apos;d find that all of the base damage on spells/abilities stays in constant ratios at all levels, for a given class, BTW. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408129439516471296))<br>
And that&apos;s the problem. For a lvl 30 with 150 SP, this increases Wrath by 138% but Healing Touch by just 28%<br>
Heals had higher base healing to make up for players having base health. However, that didn&apos;t line up and scale perfectly. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408140211420278784))<br>
In WoD, there will be no more base health, or base damage/healing on spells, so it&apos;s all just scaling; can line up. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408140362843054080))<br>
So whats this going to do to dmg and healing at low lvls if you don&apos;t have heirlooms you won&apos;t have much stats.<br>
There are still base stats. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408159136526790656))<br>
Is there going to be a base amount of the new secondaries? like even with 0 crit rating u still crit<br>
No. You still crit with 0 crit rating because you have 5% base crit, and crit from agi/int. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408388234477973504))<br>
More similar to haste, where there is no base amount of haste. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408388486824087552))<br>
<br>
Does no Dodge/Parry on gear mean Strength -&gt; Parry and Agility -&gt; Dodge are being removed as well?<br>
Nope, those remain. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408330328961339392))<br>
<br>
Now that we have 3 new secondary stats (Amplify, etc.). How many of these stats will we see on a single piece of gear? Still 2?<br>
Still typically 2 secondary stats on most gear. May be exceptions, as always, but vast majority of the time, 2. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408297359433412608))<br>
<br>
Will melee abilities still be affected by Weapon damage. Or are those abilities now only scaled by AP?<br>
Yes, weapon damage will still be a thing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408297028947427328))<br>
<br>
If this means all dmg spells and heals will scale with primary stat, this is a good thing although simplifies gear<br>
Typically Attack Power or Spell Power, which mostly come from your primary stat. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408122581212880896))<br>
<br>
would be nice for weapons to means as much to casters a physical.<br>
Somewhat ironically, weapons are actually *more* important for some casters, than some melees. SP bonus is huge. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408296295367847936))<br>
<br>
sorry if this is a repeat question but if I gem say spirit then trade to dps or tank does that gem change too eg haste for dps ?<br>
No, only primaries on armor slots switch. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408089701191405568))<br>
sorry im more asking for the gem side the fact that say pally chest has a gem socket do I have to swap it everytime swap spec ?<br>
Sorry, not sure I understand the question. If you put a Spirit gem in a socket, it provides no value if you respec to Feral. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408112465130438656))<br>
ok thank you that means if I have a gem socket armor piece when swap to my off spec I either need new gear or a different gem<br>
To min-max, yes. However, remember that a different item of the same ilvl likely won&apos;t have the gem socket; sockets are free. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408118304197189632))<br>
<br>
Will Cleave on gear mean CC&apos;d mobs have to be moved to Uzbekistan to avoid sheep-busting?<br>
No. Cleave won&apos;t hit CC&apos;d or mobs, or mobs you aren&apos;t in combat with. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408076595295817728))<br>
<br>
Does it mean won&apos;t be useful or won&apos;t be optimal? Is this applying to PVP too? <br>
Spirit will have zero value for non-healers, including in PvP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408075323813539840))<br>
<br>
In WoD, does the baseline yellow attack hit cap include attacks against targets that are higher than 3 levels above you?<br>
Yes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408034390569021440))<br>
Does that also mean a lvl 1 character will have 100% hit chance against a level 100 character or mobs? aoe questing inc<br>
No. Just up to +3 levels, then you start missing again. Similar to how Crushing Blows still exist now. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408052825839517696))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
I&apos;ve had a question about PvP. Why is there a gear req? Why isn&apos;t it stats-agnostic, to make the game 100% skill-dependent? Thanks!<br>
WoW is a character driven game where you participate in different activities for rewards. PvP is one of those activities. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408667382832300032))<br>
I know that very well I would just love an option at some point in time for pure stat-agnostic, skill-based pvp.<br>
http://wowpedia.org/Trial_of_the_Gladiator (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408669295996989440))<br>
<br>
Also, kudos for taking out expertise and hit. Step in the right direction! Still, I wish all radials were disabled in PvP though!<br>
While there may be a place for a game with WoW gameplay and no stats/gear, WoW is not that game. WoW is an RPG. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408681349357137920))<br>
Why not poll the PvP population and see what they&#x2019;d think of a permanent Trial-of-the-Champions play style?<br>
Polling the population is not how we design games. Personally, I&apos;d find it pretty unrewarding. I like getting gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408682553982193664))<br>
<br>
Crafted pvp gear feels a bit gated. Not many want to use daily cd on making 476/458 gear. Maybe lower mats over time?<br>
We don&apos;t like the starter gear coming from crafting. Exploring the idea of BoE starter gear coming from battleground wins. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408667717554536448))<br>
OMFG BoE PvP starter gear?! If it&apos;s BoA I will make you a(nother) million cookies (BoE is still awesome though!)<br>
I can see your point but I think BoA might be worse in this case. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408670101886357505))<br>
<br>
What other steps would be in there to keep those first few BG experiences from being even more brutal to new folk?<br>
I think a lot of the UI changes we&apos;re making are in support that goal (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408669540252278785))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
And you are the next Ghostcrawler ?<br>
Nah, I just work on flavor/feels things like Headless Horsemen &amp; Darkmoon Faires &amp; zombie plagues &amp; pets &amp; toys &amp; so on. (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/408642392447647745))<br>
You&apos;re my friggin hero for trolling people about Kara so damn hard.<br>
Just wait until Heroic Zul&apos;Farrak gets data mined. (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/408497425729347584))<br>
