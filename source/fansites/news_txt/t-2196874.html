Legion Assaults<br>
Legion Assaults will go live later today (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/849322657657106432)! You will need to earn Defender of the Broken Isles (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11544-defender-of-the-broken-isles) for Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Two (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11446-broken-isles-pathfinder-part-two).<br>
<br>
<br>
The invasion begins with a zone being under attack. The skybox, world quests, and the NPCs present are changed in some areas, similar to the pre-expansion invasions. <br>
The invasion quests are similar to the regular world quests, requiring you to kill NPCs and click objects.<br>
After completing all six invasion world quests, you have completed the Assault on Zone quest (http://www.wowdb.com/quests?filter-patch=23436&amp;filter-daily=1&amp;filter-search=Assault), allowing you to move to the next stage.<br>
Next you are sent to a specific point in the zone to defeat more invaders, with some similar followup quests.<br>
After all of these quests are complete, there is a three player invasion scenario that sends you to the Legion ship in the sky.<br>
On the ship you defeat various NPCs before defeating the leader and taking down the ship. <br>
