Boubouille2007-06-12, 10:06 AMArena Season 2 on PTR
Still don't know when we'll get the next PTR patch, which means we can't get more stats for the moment. We're pretty sure that the new patch will include new epic boots/belt/wrists matching each arena sets, new epic misc. items Neck/Ring/Trinket/Whatever makes Blizzard happy
Cockatrice and Elekk PvP mount are also in the 2.1.2 game files, don't know if they'll be included.

Updates
Infineon updated his Fraps Tutorial  with Dual Core and Windowed Mode informations.
The map of the Sha'tari Skyguards Guide  has been updated with a few more locations.
The Hall of Fame  is now complete, it probably won't need to be updated for a while and a better version could be available soon. 
I added the Arena Season 2 sets skins previews to the Arena Rating Calculator  I also added a small line at the bottom of the page to let you know when the calculator has been upgraded, to make sure that the formula is up to date.


That's all for the moment, should have more interesting things coming soon. Tomorrow if I don't slack too much

Addon Highlight
A lot of people have been asking about it on the forums, I thought it could be a good thing to mention Ratingbuster 
On most of my items screenshots, you can notice stats summary, and rating conversion into %, that's the mod that does everything. It's very customizeable and I suggest that you read the whole mod description on Curse to tweak it to your desires.
