The european server message was updated (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/january/breakingnews0701.jpg) a few minutes ago with the following: <br>
Weekly Maintenance, 07/01<br>
This Wednesday there will be a live maintenance, i.e. rolling restarts of all realms between 05:00 and 07:00 CET. Each realm will receive a 15 minute notice prior to being restarted. Thank you for your patience and understanding.<br>
The patch is definitely not going live in Europe tomorrow, there isn&apos;t any reason to see it on US servers this week. You can go back to a normal life for one more week.</div></div>
