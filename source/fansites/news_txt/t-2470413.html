Patch 8.1.5 PTR - Island Expedition BoA Gear Tokens<br>
The Seafarer&apos;s Dubloon vendors (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8099-Seafarer-s-Doubloon-Vendors-Diablo-3-BlizzCon-Reward-MDI-All-Stars-at-BlizzCon?page=) now sell several bind on account gear tokens for 20 x Seafarer&apos;s Dubloons (https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1710-seafarers-dubloon) each. These can be used or mailed to alts that are Level 111+. <br>
<br>
These work much like the gear tokens from Tanaan Jungle and Argus, providing a piece of gear appropriate for the level of the character that utilizes it. The item level starts at 214 for level 111&apos;s and increases up to 282 for a level 120. The tokens can proc higher item levels, much like previous iterations.<br>
