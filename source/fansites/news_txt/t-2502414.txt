Patch 8.2 Hotfixes - August 9th, 2019
Dungeons and Raids

Azshara’s Eternal Palace

The Queen’s Court

Fixed a bug with Frenetic Charge https://www.wowdb.com/spells/300550-frenetic-charge which would cause Aspect of the Turtle https://www.wowdb.com/spells/186265-aspect-of-the-turtle to not correctly mitigate the damage and knockback effects.

Za’qul, Harbinger of Ny’alotha

Reverted a change that caused Mind Tether https://www.wowdb.com/spells/295537-mind-tether to deal excessive damage to the linked target.
Corrected an issue where Mind Tether https://www.wowdb.com/spells/295537-mind-tether would not attach two targets that were in separate phases.


Operation: Mechagon

Fixed an issue that could cause players to become locked to the normal encounter if they killed King Mechagon on hard mode and died at the same time.



Island Expeditions

The bonus amount of Azerite granted to players with the Azerite Residue buff has been increased based on Island Expedition difficulty.

Heroic Island Expeditions

2 Azerite per stack of Azerite Residue, 500 Azerite total per player at full stack.

Mythic Island Expeditions

3 Azerite per stack of Azerite Residue, 750 Azerite total per player at full stack.

PvP Island Expeditions

4 Azerite per stack of Azerite Residue, 900 Azerite total per player at full stack.


Azerite Residue increases in potency more quickly based on Island Expeditions difficulty.

Heroic Island Expeditions

Azerite Residue now increments every 1.5 seconds 6 minutes 15 seconds to reach full.

Mythic Island Expeditions

Azerite Residue now increments every 1.25 seconds 5 minutes 12 seconds to reach full.

PvP Island Expeditions

Azerite Residue now increments every 1 second 3 minutes 45 seconds to reach full.


Developers’ note: As higher Island Expedition difficulties award larger total amounts of Azerite, we want to ensure that the reward for engaging and defeating the enemy team remains relevant, especially in PvP Islands.


Items

Fixed an issue that allowed certain abilities to remove the "Recharging" debuff from Logic Loops.


Quests

“Taking the Air Out” is now offered more often in Mechagon.
