A new build will be deployed today on test servers.<br>
At this time, the PTRs are going down for a version update. The Build Number thread will be updated once the update is complete and the PTRs are running once again.<br>
<br>
We have no ETA for when the PTRs will be back up. <br>

Naxxramas and World Latency Fixes<br>
For the last several weeks, our players have been experiencing periodic latency in both outdoor Northrend areas and Naxxramas, and we wanted to provide you with several updates on what we&apos;re doing to resolve these issues. As many players have discovered, the outdoor Northrend latency has been tied to activity in Wintergrasp. We are actively working on a server-side fix that should address the high latency experienced in the outdoor world when Wintergrasp is active. This fix is currently in testing on internal test realms and we anticipate that we&apos;ll be able to push it to live realms in the near future. Concerning Naxxramas, optimizations are being made that will address both the latency and disconnection issues affecting players while in that zone. These optimizations will be included with the next minor content patch.<br>
<br>
We appreciate your patience as we work to address these issues. <br>
<br>
<br>
Hotfix - Talent Issue<br>
During the transition from patch 2.4.3 to 3.0.3 the following talents were not unlearned properly by some players, resulting in those players still gaining the benefits despite the talents no longer existing in the talent trees. As a result, we&apos;ve pushed a hotfix which has corrected this matter and affected players will longer receive credit for having these talents.<br>
<br>
Warlock: Improved Lash of Pain<br>
Warlock: Fel Stamina<br>
Shaman: Totemic Mastery<br>
Shaman: Improved Lightning Shield (Rank 3)<br>
Paladin: Precision<br>
Rogue: Fist Weapon Specialization<br>
Priest: Shadow Focus (Ranks 4 and 5)<br>
<br>

Dual talent spec &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MAYBE &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; in Patch 3.1<br>
It will not be in the next patch, 3.0.8. If all goes well, we&apos;ll get it in the one after that, but we usually don&apos;t tell you our estimates so there is less ALL CAPS POSTING when we miss our targets. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14287248675-gc-dual-speccing.html))<br>

Diminishing Returns on silence effects<br>
We are considering DR for silence effects.<br>
<br>
Also note that there was a bug preventing talents that reduce silence effects from working correctly with Strangulate. They should do so in 3.0.8. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14274387607-its-time-for-the-silence-mechanic-to-change.html))<br>

Mana pools and new % based drain spells<br>
We don&apos;t design mana the same way. Not all classes and specs are intended to stack mana, and more mana isn&apos;t as good for some classes as others. We don&apos;t want Ret (to give the obvious example) to stack Int and we don&apos;t give them an effective way to do so. Therefore, mana draining Ret shouldn&apos;t be massively more effective than classes with huge mana pools. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14287208658-manaburn-change-makes-no-sense.html))<br>
<br>
Rated battlegrounds<br>
I&apos;m not sure rated BGs is the only answer. It definitely is an answer and something we talk about a lot. We start to think about a lot of logistical problems of managing a 15+ person BG team, but that is certainly one approach too.<br>
<br>
Arenas do not reward time spent nearly as well as BGs do, and I think that is actually one of the strengths of Arenas. However, to reward skill in BGs we would not only have to come up with a brilliant way to measure skill (which is frankly something we would very much like to do), but we would also need a way to keep players from just BGing over and over to grind points. Yet, one of the strengths of the BG compared to Areans is that you can spend as much time in them as you want. If you are just the kind of player who plays for large stretches of time at one sitting, BGs can be an attractive way to spend that time.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m not specifcally announcing nor shooting down anything, but I am trying to encourage the discussion. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14133729483-how-would-you-do-rated-battlegrounds.html))<br>

Shadow of Death<br>
We&apos;re not happy with the way this ability is working in Arena. Honestly, Shadow of Death has been a pretty buggy talent for much of its existence, and you have my apologies for that. It was a neat idea but it&apos;s been a huge pain in the neck. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14274817767-dks-turning-in-ghouls-in-arena.html))<br>

Aquatic Form trainable at level 16 and related quest<br>
I&apos;m fairly certain we&apos;re not removing the quest, it simply won&apos;t be required for the aquatic form. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14133099235-aquatic-form.html))<br>

Prowl / Spirit Beast bug<br>
We fixed this bug. Prowl was designed to work with cats, so it wasn&apos;t set up to look for ranged, non-physical attacks. Spirit Beasts have gotten a lot of love, and we certainly run the risk that they will feel like mandatory pets now. We&apos;ll see.

Hunter nerfs in 3.0.8 and effects on scaling<br>
To repeat, I did not say we will nerf you now and buff you later. I said we are going to nerf hunters now because we think they need it. Scaling, which is sometimes a valid concern, is not a valid concern in this case because we are going to change the numbers before anyone can acquire gear higher than a 226 item level. We are not changing the numbers to buff or nerf hunters at that point. We are changing them for entirely different reasons which we hope to be able to talk about once we have had a chance to iterate on them some more.

Mage bugs<br>
We have a solution for Mirror Image Polymorph spam. <br>
<br>
There is a technical problem with adding spell pen to pets. As I&apos;ve mentioned a couple of times, the entire system of how pets inherit stats (and buffs) needs to be overhauled and we are working on that now. Most pets do have hit I believe.<br>
<br>
We fixed a bug in 3.0.8 where the racial spell hit bonus was applied after the other modifiers were added, meaning that you could not cap yourself above it. Now if you really want to hit races with certain spells you can. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14274697704-some-allarming-issues-not-mentioned-for-patch.html))<br>

Priest Role<br>
You guys are trying to dissect subtle differences between &quot;gap filling&quot; and &quot;being well rounded.&quot; Those are just words. They are descriptive, not definitive.<br>
<br>
Priests can do lots of different things. When you bring a priest of any spec, you get some really nice buffs (like Fort or Spirit) and utility (such as Mass Dispel). When you bring a healing priest, you bring enormous benefits in flexibility. The priest can Greater Heal the tank on one fight, cast spot Renews and PoMs on the melee dps in another fight, throw out a CoH or PoH when lots of people are down at once, or Flash or PW:S a rogue before she dies. Casting GS or Pain Supression on a tank, especially an OT who dps&apos;s a lot and may not have the gear, can be really useful.<br>
<br>
You can shift from fight to fight depending on the specifics of the encounter and the needs of the raid. If you are in a group where raid attendance is not always 100%, a priest is a wondeful thing to have. You can tank heal when the paladins don&apos;t log or hot when the druids don&apos;t log.<br>
<br>
The strongest groups will have all 4-5 types of healers. But we also tried to design the encounters so that you can work around it if you are missing a few.<br>
<br>
If your raid is stacked with paladin healers your group healing will suffer. If your raid is stacked with druid healers, your tank healing will suffer. If your raid is stacked with priests, you won&apos;t have any problems.<br>
<br>
If that type of role doesn&apos;t appeal to you, I can understand. There seem to be a lot of priests (on these forums) who just don&apos;t like priests and want them to be something else. But really we think they&apos;re fine and will keep getting spots on raids and Arena teams. For a lot of players, &quot;priest&quot; is *still* synonymous with &quot;healer.&quot; I don&apos;t think we&apos;re in danger of that changing.

Rogues in 3.0.8<br>
Most intelligent, honest players would probably agree that rogues are a little too good in PvP and weaker than the top dps dealers on raids -- but since many of those top dealers are getting nerfed, hopefully rogues will be in a very good place after 3.0.8. But all of that is for one spec of rogue. We feel that hunters will have 3 viable trees in 3.0.8 and we&apos;d love to get rogues into that same place. It&apos;s just harder for rogues.<br>
<br>
One idea I see a lot is to give a little bit more armor pen to deep Combat and I think there are a lot of things we can do to deep Subt. But those changes all need to be deep, or rogues will just skim off the top of any tree to maximize their dps. Making haste, and perhaps armor pen too, a little more beneficial to melee will also bring them up, though that may mean nerfing some other classes. These aren&apos;t announcements, just the kind of things I see on the forums. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14132918089-gc-why.html))<br>

Chaos Bolt<br>
We tried Chaos Bolt as a unique school of magic that pierced immunities. It was quite overpowered. Consider that part of the reason Holy damage is so good is because you can&apos;t resist it. Now imagine a Holy spell fired with warlock-level spellpower that could also go through defenses. It was just too good. Sorry.
