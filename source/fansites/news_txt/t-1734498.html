Blizzard CMs<br>
I&apos;m looking for Blizzard participation in the forums. I know it&apos;s not a &apos;directly profitable&apos; function and probably is the first thing looked at when &apos;do more with less so we can pay a bigger dividend&apos; comes up. But it&apos;s a good long term investment to engage your customer audience.<br>
We agree and the WoW CM team has only grown since the game was released (&quot;do more with less for bigger dividends&quot; sounds very cynical and has never been an operating procedure for us). We&apos;ve taken on a host of various responsibilities over the years, but community engagement remains a primary objective.<br>
<br>
That said, our &quot;customer audience&quot; expands well beyond these forums and we have to keep that in perspective. There needs to be a larger engagement strategy so our time is well managed.<br>
<br>
On a related note, I&apos;m not going to have much time at all today to engage the community because I&apos;m organizing a lot of data in Excel. But that data will later be used to inform how, where, and why we engage the community. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/364572-gms-in-the-forums-are-a-good-thing/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16543825060?page=1#11))<br>

10% Damage Reduction in PvP<br>
Simply put, we felt that PvP damage was too high across the board. There were several changes in Patch 6.1 that caused a general increase in PvP damage, and this change was meant to counterbalance that. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/364575-10-damage-reduction-in-pvp/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16544975176?page=5#84))<br>
<br>
Hunter Pet Damage<br>
We&apos;ve just pushed a hotfix that reduces the Cornered damage increase from 50% to 20%. It&apos;ll still probably be wise to kill Hunter pets at low HP, but that should make the strategy of purposefully summoning a pet at low health significantly less effective.<br>
<br>
20% is still more than 0. So they&apos;re still going to do it.<br>
Sure, but it&apos;s a much more dangerous tradeoff considering how quickly a low-HP Hunter pet can be killed. There&apos;s significantly less reward for the risk.

Blood Elf Model Feedback<br>
The feedback was gathered? i&apos;m not sure about that. &quot;my weapons are far too big!&quot; was said about 5 billion times and they still went forward with it. the smug expressions are still there and the terrible run animations are still there.<br>
<br>
Weapon size is a divided topic for sure. We saw lots of feedback (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3988401767) before the models changed that weapons (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3523323517) were (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15538335548) too (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15355236696) small (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/12675388849). I think we adjusted weapon size back and forth during testing to hit a spot that most people were happy with, but I know some of you&apos;d still prefer something smaller.

A bug on the DMF&apos;s race: sometimes when you hit a post, you get an extra toll. Climb to the blue post and u get 3-&gt;5 tolls.<br>

Chance the ring toss vendor could be a little further from the gate, everyone stands on her while tossing rings. #dmf<br>
We&apos;re hoping to have this addressed in a future patch. For now, try toggling nameplates and/or using a &apos;/tar Jessica&apos; command. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/572564598995357696))<br>
