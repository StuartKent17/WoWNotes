Oh, I know how much you love world first kill news lately, but this one might actually be slightly more interesting! The hardest version of Sartharion with 10 players actually got the reputation to be the hardest encounter currently available in game and remained undefeated until today. 

A few hours ago, Method http://methodwow.com/news.php?ID=23 EU-Sylvanas got him down and were rewarded with a new title - "of the Nightfall http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?tab=0&page=777". As usual you can always check our dedicated page http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=813 for a list of the loot available in the instance.

Congratulations to them, it seems that the competition for World First kills isn't totally dead.
