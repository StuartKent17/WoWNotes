Oh, I know how much you love world first kill news lately, but this one might actually be slightly more interesting! The hardest version of Sartharion with 10 players actually got the reputation to be the hardest encounter currently available in game and remained undefeated until today. 

A few hours ago, Method  EU-Sylvanas got him down and were rewarded with a new title - "of the Nightfall ". As usual you can always check our dedicated page  for a list of the loot available in the instance. 


 

Congratulations to them, it seems that the competition for World First kills isn't totally dead.

The Quests category has been added and will be expanded soon.

Talent Calculator
Most of the annoying bugs on the new talent + glyph calculator  should be fixed now, if you still experience any problem while using it please report it in comments. Note: it will NOT work if you're using an outdated browser, sorry IE6 users
