Kil'jaeden vs Loot FTW - Dragon controller PoV
This is probably the last video of KJ we'll post, this one is from Loot FTW  and shows the dragon controller point of views for the first time. As you can see in the video this is a very important role during the encounter and it will probably interest some people to see how it's done.

Season 4 "2 weeks warning"
We don't provide release dates far in advance, this should come as no surprise really. We also feel that providing a 2 week warning is sufficient time for players to prepare for the end of the current season and the beginning of a new one. Source 

BC Legendaries aren't getting an upgrade in WotLK
Our answer to this has been said before as well and we don't have any changes to it at this time. Source 


New Wrath of the Lich King Wallpaper
We just added a new fan wallpaper to our Wrath of the Lich King wallpapers section. This wallpaper features the fearful Lich King, grasping the hilt of Frostmourne, his icy gaze glaring out a challenge at the watcher.
