Kil'jaeden vs Loot FTW - Dragon controller PoV
This is probably the last video of KJ we'll post, this one is from Loot FTW http://www.lootftw.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4311 and shows the dragon controller point of views for the first time. As you can see in the video this is a very important role during the encounter and it will probably interest some people to see how it's done.

Season 4 "2 weeks warning"
We don't provide release dates far in advance, this should come as no surprise really. We also feel that providing a 2 week warning is sufficient time for players to prepare for the end of the current season and the beginning of a new one.

New Wrath of the Lich King Wallpaper
We just added a new fan wallpaper to our Wrath of the Lich King wallpapers section. This wallpaper features the fearful Lich King, grasping the hilt of Frostmourne, his icy gaze glaring out a challenge at the watcher.
