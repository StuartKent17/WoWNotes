Developer Interview - Faction Identity<br>
Polygon had the opportunity to talk to Steve Danuser (Narrative Producer) and Ely Cannon (Lead Artist). <br>
<br>
<br>
What the Horde stands for has changed over time. Is it a group driven by honor and courage or a disparate collection of outcasts that nobody will align themselves with.<br>
Battle for Azeroth is an opportunity to look at both sides that have made up the Horde storylines throughout the years and pull them together.<br>
It may be a chance for the Horde to look inward and become something new and stronger.<br>
Sylvanas and Saurfang are embodying the other aspects of what the Horde was.<br>
To get to the future of the Horde, we have to face the Horde&#x2019;s past.<br>
The Alliance has its share of disparity and there&apos;s going to be a self-examination of what the Alliance is about and how they want to behave.<br>
Does the Alliance want to get revenge on the Horde, or do they want to build a better world?<br>
There is room for what the Alliance and Horde represent to evolve and change and for their relationship to change.<br>
Player&apos;s identity is very much tied to their faction and the things they have done for it, so it wouldn&apos;t be something the team would take away lightly. <br>
This expansion focuses on shaping what the factions mean in the world and how they interact with one another.<br>

Arena World Championship<br>
Announcing the 2018 Arena World Championship Fall Season<br>
As conflict burns in the Battle for Azeroth, the power of the greatest Horde and Alliance heroes ignites. If you think you have what it takes to prove your PvP skills are among the best in the world, signups are now open for the first Cup of the Fall Season of the 2018 Arena World Championship (AWC).<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CtuA162mlVc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br>
<br>
The Arena World Championship is a 3v3 tournament that takes place in the iconic battlegrounds of Azeroth. In this Fall Season, we are introducing Mugambala and Hook Point, two asymmetrical arenas which were released in the Battle for Azeroth expansion.<br>
<br>
<br>
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/arena1.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/arena1.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/arena2.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/arena2.jpg) <br>
<br>
<br>
Mugambala is set in Zandalar, a region that was once a part of ancient Kalimdor and the birthplace of troll civilization. This arena features an upper level, and a lower level with a large pillar in the middle.<br>
<br>
Hook Point is an area in Boralus, where only the bravest battle for the right to call themselves true Kul Tirans! It features four pillars for players to dance around&#x2014;one with a shark hanging from it&#x2014;and two smaller pillars.<br>
<br>
This season, there are six Cups up for grabs&#x2014;three in North American and three in Europe&#x2014;each with a prize pool of $10,000 and an increased amount of AWC points on offer, more than any season this year!<br>
<br>
No Arena ranking is required for teams of three to four people to sign up. Once you are deemed eligible to compete, you will have access to the Tournament Realm, where you and your teammates will have the ability to create whatever class, talent, and gear combinations you see fit, to practice taking down all who oppose you! If you think you have what it takes, sign up here (https://battlefy.com/world-of-warcraft-arena-world-championship), and check out the table below for the cutoff times for each of the Fall Season Cups.<br>
<br>
Remember, the top three point-earners of the year from North America and Europe will earn a spot at the Arena World Championship Global Finals at BlizzCon, where they will fight on the biggest WoW esports stage of the year for their share of the $280,000 prize pool.<br>
<br>
If you&#x2019;re coming back to World of Warcraft for Battle for Azeroth and want to see how the pros handle the new PvP talent system, join us! The Top 8 from each Cup in North America and Europe will be broadcast live on Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/warcraft). Watch as the greatest heroes from across North America and Europe adapt to the changes&#x2014;it might give you some tips and tricks for your own Arena adventures!<br>
