Boubouille2008-04-28, 09:34 AMUpdate 12:15 CEST : Added something about the epic gems from the sunwell vendors and another line from the game files hinting at a % of reputation bonus for people referring friends.


Epic gems available for 15 Badges from the Sunwell Isle Vendor
US-Proudmoore  just completed the last phase of the Shattered Sun Offensive and can now buy all the epic gems from the vendor for ... 15 Badges !  The official armory showing them for sale @ 10 badges was indeed a bug from the website. 


Recruiting a Friend ... more interesting in the future ?
If you've been playing WoW for some time, You probably noticed at some point the option to "Recruit a friend" on your account management page, or even used it. According to the changes made to some files listing error messages in the game, it looks like you will soon be able to have a few more options to help your friends in game, like summoning them or even ... granting them a level ? 

Of course, nothing is official yet, and it's possible that we'll never see that in game. 

ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_DIFFERENT_FACTION = "You cannot grant levels to a character of the opposite faction."; 
ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_GRANT_LEVEL_MAX_I = "You cannot grant levels to players level %d or higher."; 
ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_INSUFFICIENT_GRANTABLE_LEVELS = "You have not earned enough levels to grant any more levels."; 
ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_NOT_NOW = "You cannot grant that player a level right now."; 
ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_NOT_REFERRED_BY = "You were not referred by that player."; 
ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_SUMMON_COOLDOWN = "You can only summon your friend once per hour."; 
ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_SUMMON_LEVEL_MAX_I = "You cannot summon players above level %d."; 
ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_TARGET_TOO_HIGH = "That player's level is too high."; 
ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_TOO_FAR = "That player is too far away."; 
FACTION_STANDING_INCREASED_BONUS = "Reputation with %s increased by %d. +%.1f Refer-A-Friend bonus";





Blacksmithing BOP Weapons Dual-wieldable in 2.4.2
Blacksmiths are probably going to be happy, all their BOP Weapons have been changed and aren't unique anymore ! That's a nice change alone, but if you took the time to read the 2.4.2 Patch Notes you probably remember seeing something mentioning Main Hand weapons changed to One-Hand .... Well that's the case here, you can now dual-wield them  !


 


Twin Eredars reverse kill videos
As mentionned last week , killing Lady Sacrolash first during the Twin Eredar encounters rewards the raid with one more epic loot and 4 sunmotes. It didn't take long before we saw some videos of the encounter released publicly. 

The first video is from Vortex , the 2nd one from Fusion , and the last one from Vodka
