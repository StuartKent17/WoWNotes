Blizzard Balance Gifting Now Available!
Struggling to find the perfect gift for a friend, or just hoping to give them the flexibility to choose their own gifts?

We’re expanding our gifting service by allowing you to send Blizzard Balance to your friends, offering you the benefits of retail gift cards in a new and easy-to-use digital format.

Sending Balance gifts is simple: visit the Blizzard Shop , select one of the suggested values—or enter a custom amount, click the “Gift Balance” button, and select a friend.


 

Blizzard will deliver your gift along with a notification and personalized message directly to your friend, who can then claim the digital gift card balance onto their account.


  

As with other gifts, you’ll receive an email and a notification in the Blizzard App when a friend sends you Blizzard Balance, informing you that the gift has arrived and is ready to be claimed.

Giving the gift of Blizzard Balance is a fast and easy way to ensure that your friends and family will get the Blizzard product that they want most.

Happy Gifting!
