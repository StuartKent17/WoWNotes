Loot Rules
I've commented on this before, but MS>OS is an extremely vague and fluid concept. For example someone who mains a Protection Warrior might join a raid as Arms because all the tank spots are full. While Protection is technically their MS, they are in the raid as Arms, which causes other players to believe that Arms is the MS of that Warrior. Is that Warrior, or the Master Looter, then in the wrong if they receive a tank trinket?

Likewise, what about players who change specs mid-raid such as a DPS switching to Healer to allow the raid to continue if the group can't backfill people who have left, where do these players fit in with regards to MS>OS?

Let's then say that the raid leader fails to update their LFG listing to reflect the change. The change doesn't get explained to the DPS who subsequently join, causing them to feel that something has been ninja'ed when the now-Healer is given a DPS item. Is anyone actually in the wrong here?

These are just some examples of the ambiguity MS>OS can fall into.

Generally, the Master Looter system is intended to be used in groups of people you trust. By joining a PuG raid with Master Looter set, you join knowing that the Master Looter has the power to assign the loot. If you don't seek precise clarification, in chat, on how the loot will be allocated, our Game Masters cannot then assist you on the basis of unspoken assumptions when so many grey areas are in play.
