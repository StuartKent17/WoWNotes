Patch 5.4 - Kor'kron Supplies
One nice addition in Patch 5.4 that not many people have noticed is the Kor'kron Supply crates http://www.wowdb.com/objects/223521-korkron-supplies scattered around the Dark Shaman area of the Siege of Orgrimmar. These boxes contain flasks and potions that aren't specific to your class or spec and are a nice way to supplement your guild's or your own! consumable supply.

DPS/HPS logs should have never been added to the game. The cost is not justified by the benefit.
It's nice to be able to evaluate your performance to fine tune gear or rotation. Agree the competitive aspect is out of control. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374970588487360512

This AM I saw: our DPS is too low, nobody wants us, we need an overhaul from pretty much every class. Those all can't be true. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374986824050962432
I think it's obv from buffs/nerfs through the exp cycle that it's obvious overhauls needed. Scaling is out of control
Players obsess about scaling too much. OTOH even with perfect scaling, players would be unhappy if we didn't constantly tune balance Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375298008297922560
Put another way, even if all specs scaled identically with gear, encounter mechanics have a far greater impact on performance. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375298283435868160

I disagree. I think a support class fun as long as people knew up front that's what they were rolling.
That's possible. Back in the MC days I suspect many players made their class decisions without that information. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374968597551910912
In fact, I suspect back in the MC days, many players didn't even consider the endgame until they got there. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374968686848643072
I will agree it was bullshit to find out that your feral was garbage. Less impressed with shaman/pally arguments tho.
My original MC raid had at least 4 paladins that rolled to be melee DPS and were told they had to heal and buff in raids. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374978517634514944

Actually it's because the class has been switched upside down since launch
Claiming we don't have a direction or vision for a class is generally a good way not to get us to read something. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374972660163162113
It's not that we are afraid of criticism; far from it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374972833446645760
We were pretty clear that Fistweaving was always a secondary mechanic, much like Atonement healing. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374978074942529536
We never wanted to hear monks or any healer say "I cannot stand with the other healers. I MUST be in melee." Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374978158358831104

When people ask me what spec to play, I often tell them "whatever you enjoy or can do the best at" is this good advice?
Yes. Most players worry far too much about theoretical max DPS. The success of *your* group is rarely dependent on it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373973081523367936

what u think of talent trees? do u really think ur playerbase wants to constantly switch talents every 5 seconds?
We think they want to change talents once in awhile, versus the old model of never looking at the talent screen again. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374951663531855872

e.g. specialize on the talent level, not the class level, by providing talents that significantly favour single or AE healing?
I think you would have to do something like: must have a shield healer and an AE healer, with 2-3 class choices each. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373969275641282560
The problem with talents, though we still do it sometimes, is AE usually wins in MoP. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373969468826722304
It's really hard to get that "glad we have a druid" feel you're looking for without very strong / mandatory unique utility. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373969759382945792
A different design is that instead of tank, healer, DPS ABC you have ABCDE and a 10 needs two of each. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373970159645388800
The ABCDE model lets each class / spec feel powerful and unique but hurts the raid that likes to raid with e.g. 3 hunters. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373970314947870720

why all caster class haste make more DoT's Ticks, but meele and ranged this isn't happen??
The intent is haste generally provides more resources for melee and hunters to deliver on the "haste lets you do more" concept. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378962938985316354

Example A: Deterrence doesn't work how it is supposed to work and is half as strong as it is supposed to be. no fix
Deterrence in 5.4 is working as intended. The charge system has proven challenging to explain / understand. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/380061998525865984

the question about female Demon Form is constantly dodged by Blues. Is this so hard to implement? Would make locks happy.
Not that hard to implement, but it does take real artist time if it's more than just a bow on a Voidwalker. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/380065816164593664
but what if my voidwalker wants to wear a bow, even voidwalkers want to feel pretty.
I'm not judging. Each voidwalker can dress how he or she wants. I won't burden them with traditional gender norms. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/380088065336688640

Character / Items
Can we remove Personal Loot from Flex, Getting the same item 4 weeks in a row in LFR is terrible design
Sharding the same item 4 weeks in a row in heroic isn't all that fun either. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376881551167852544
so why are there capes dropping in heroic soo?
Maybe one of your raiders decided to reroll and doesn't have an orange cloak? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377205353064046592

Hey Greg, would you be so kind and explain the drop-system of the new heirloom weapons?
The first one you get will be for your loot spec. After that it's random. All are personal loot. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376877561990488064
Is it the 1st one on each difficulty mode F/N/H, or only the 1st one on the first difficulty mode you clear?
The intent is per difficulty. We don't want someone e.g. avoiding N Garrosh for fear of wasting their chance. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376888397295411201

Flex Raiding
First 2 wings of Flex down and must say rivals BT for epic so far. Boss fights are mad fun and seem to reflect player feedback
Oustanding. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/381499429166936065

How many teeth are missing from the average Flex audience member? Are they shirtless? Have they been on "COPS"?
Our hope is that they are pretty normal players who put a premium on playing with friends and family over progression. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376887849628344321
A traditional raiding guild might boot a nice player with low DPS. The intended flex audience would never dream of it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376888081313304577

i will not use on principle its an attempt to kill lfr.
It is not an attempt to kill LFR. It's an attempt to provide a more casual alternative to N for social groups who don't enjoy LFR. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373885346028605440
Flex just is not needed. There's already that... it's called 10-man. If guild can't form then they have bigger issues.
We disagree. 10-player ToT is harder than 10-player ICC. The players who enjoyed the ICC level of difficulty are shut out. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374988919940464640
What was the rationale for the step-up in difficulty since Wrath? Did 10-man ICC feel too easy to devs?
A series of steps. 1 Didn't want 10s to feel like 2nd class citizens, so we gave them the same ilevel. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375301972712112128
2 Didn't want same ilevel for easier difficulty, so we brought 10s up to the 25 level overall - there is variety per boss. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375302077653606400
You can argue that those were both missteps, but that's how we arrived where we are today. Flex is trying to recapture ICC 10. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375302198206271488
