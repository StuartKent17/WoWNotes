Blue Tweets
PvP
With a revived tournament scene like and all of the PvP specific changes coming in Legion, I see a great future for our community. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/701521803827490816

Lore
If a creature is from, relating to, or characteristic of, demons, it can be considered demonic. So why are people pretending as if Deathwing isn't demonic?
what about an earth aspect maddened by old gods is related to demons? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/700855904741142529
but he wasn't corrupted by the demon, and the demon didn't even want to be inside of it, it was TERRIFIED of being shoved in there Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/700858441011572736
because what was really at its heart was an Old God Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/700858487266390016


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Mimiron is such a cool boss on hard mode
Mimiron was awesome. But his red button was a little tongue in cheek and I think a literal button gets silly. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700148261487644673

It was insulting!
I was attempting to explain the developer intent for the direction of dungeons. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700118678470176768
Specifically, that using a full action bar and relying on teammates makes the stakes higher and the accomplishment more rewarding OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700118847693533184
It's fine if you don't like that direction and want something else. You shouldn't feel insulted for that. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700118994540318720

I still don't get why LFR has to be so toothless. FFXIV duty finder is a tad harder and still works.
When LFR was harder, it was a miserable experience. Folks would just wipe and bail. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700198051357437953
In ancient WoW you could rejoin the same AV that you'd dropped 4 hours ago. Early LFR was almost that OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700198453591158784

because people struggle at work all day. The last thing they want from their escapism is more struggle
I don't think that's universally true. A lot of hobbies are compelling because of the challenge: golf, hunting, marathons... OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700199202429624320
Maybe plopping in front of the TV isn't challenging, but that's also not really a game. WoW is intended to be a game, not TV OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700199453278343168
I get that maybe not everyone wants soul-crushing frustration, but we're still just talking about 5 player dungeons here. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700199651576709121

do you think engineers get enough limelight in the games profession?
No, I don't. Sometimes their work is challenging to explain to players. Other times if it just works, you don't notice. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700361588226719746
