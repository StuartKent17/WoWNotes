Upcoming &quot;The Crowd Chose You&quot; Hotfix<br>
We&apos;re going to take another look at Necrotic Strike&apos;s healing absorb and whether or not we feel it should be affected by Dampening. We get that the absorb is the bulk of the ability&apos;s &quot;damage&quot;, but there is still some concern that it would be too strong. We&apos;re also discussing double Rogue.

Cata dungeons and heroics were not difficult... I don&apos;t understand this idea that they were.<br>
For matchmade groups, some like Stonecore and Grim Batol were deadly. Very low success rates. That&apos;s data, not an opinion. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384849573606207488))<br>
It&apos;s funny. Early Cata heroics are why me and my whole guild came back. Catas launch raids and heroics were so much fun!<br>
There is a place for hard content for organized groups of friends. The Cata problem was that was the only content. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385582133269364736))<br>

World Firsts aren&apos;t accurate representations of avg. play experience; better to look at more breadth.<br>
In fact world firsts are specifically fights while severely undergeared, which nobody else will be. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385142501008363520))<br>
<br>
people who come out saying they are clearing raids too fast/easy. whats your thoughts on dbm helping push through faster?<br>
I&apos;m sure it helps, but so do videos and strategy guides in general. Overall, we&apos;re happy with SoO balance at the moment. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385134886048104448))<br>

Game used to avoid caling &quot;damage&quot; role silly illetirate &quot;DPS&quot;, but it crept in in Norushen DJ and Wrathion&apos;s challenge. How?<br>
It&apos;s tough. At some point you&apos;re using different terminology than most players actually use, so it gets awkward. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384847914511515648))<br>
I think about this problem a lot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384847941862572032))<br>
<br>
Tank queue abuse is getting bad, can people queued with tanks who leave immediately be kicked automatically?<br>
That should happen today overall. If you don&apos;t abuse it often, the system is more forgiving. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384844472434966528))<br>

I know people are looking forward to character models, but I just wish night time was actually night <br>
The artists are aware of this feedback and want to try and address it in the future. Too dark is hard to play of course. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382256677971456000))<br>

It&apos;s funny you say this. I am not participating in Shaohao rep grinding because the return for the effort invested is horrible<br>
It is intended to be optional. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384842537527017472))<br>

Crowd Control &amp; Diminishing Returns<br>
We&apos;ve seen some confusion recently about exactly which crowd control effects share diminishing returns. To hopefully clear that up, we&apos;re providing the following, categorized lists of all of the CC effects in the game. <br>
<br>
For those who may be unaware of how the Diminishing Returns system works, here&apos;s a brief explanation: After you&apos;ve been affected by a crowd control effect in PvP, there&apos;s a 15 second window for diminishing returns. The second effect of the same category (as listed below) that is used on you will only last for 50% of its normal duration, and the 15 second window will be restarted. Should you be affected by a third effect from the same category inside that window, it will only last for 25% of its initial duration. The 15 second window will once again be restarted, and you will be immune to any further effects of that category for the duration.<br>
<br>
The lists below have been separated out into their specific diminishing returns categories. Each ability shares diminishing returns with the other abilities it has been listed with, and no others.<br>
