Lately, it's been rumored that the loot cards of the new expansion of WoW TCG - March of the Legion could be the Dragon Kite, the Paper Zeppelin / Gyrocopter, and the Robot Chicken.

This is probably true. A lot of crucial information in the game are only available from Blizzard servers like item stats and aren't accessible to players except if Blizzard "allows" it, however spells are available in the game files, this is why you see them updated on databases like wowhead or thottbot as soon as patches are released. Why does it matter in this case ? One of the spell related to the Dragon Kite is labeled with the name of ... Upper Deck, the company in charge of the TCG ! [spell=45207] This also was the case with the [spell=42781]

Also, available spells give a few more information about each item.

Dragon Kite [spell=45127]
The kite can be struck by lightning, it will also affect the player in some way. 

Paper Gyrocopter / Zeppelin [spell=45129] / [spell=45133]
This one is interesting, it seems that you will be able to throw it to other players, like leather balls or other items like that. The spell description clearly says that the targeted player will catch it if they have free room, this could possibly be the first "sharable" TGC loot.

Rocket Chicken [spell=45125]
It's a chicken. And huh, a robot. Nothing really interesting the spells here, the only hint is a "Suicide" spell really close to the ones related to the chicken, but nothing in the name could give a hint about the effect. 

If you want to look at all the spells, just search for Kite / Rocket Chicken / Paper Airplane, Gyrocopter, Zeppelin on Wowhead.

Also, it seems that the spells to summon the golden and the silver pig have been added to the US and European games, according to Warcraftpets.com http://www.warcraftpets.com/wow.pets/mammals/pigs/lucky.asp it was only available on Korean servers before and it could means that european and american players who got a code at the event will be able to get their pet now. [spell=45174] / [spell=45175]
