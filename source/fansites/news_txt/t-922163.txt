Tier 12 Official Preview - Druid and Warrior
Blizzard finally released the last 2 previews http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/172687/tier-12-armor-set-preview-updated-6-13 of Tier 12 armor sets, the Warrior and Druid sets. It means I finally have a confirmation that the T12 Druid set use pants and I can work on final versions of Tier 12 pages. Yay!
