The Armor Showroom has been updated with Dungeon Sets 3. 
As I said in a forum post, I had to block people who used a mail from mail.ru to register an account, this is because of spambots mostly using this mail provider.


Addons
Considering the popularity of the latest addon-related post, I guess I can talk about them more often. 
Today won't be a compilation, but an addon, one of the best I ever used : Engbags  

This is probably the best bag mod you can get, it will split your items into multiple categories automatically, will let you set up new categories and move any item or any category to another part of the bag and merge them as well. 

One of the latest feature is a search box at the bottom of the bag that let you search any item, and of course it works in your bank as well. The only real problem is the resource consumption which is a bit high but it shouldn't lower your framerate that much.
