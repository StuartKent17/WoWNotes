Bots and Hacks
We tend to not discuss what we're doing in the fight against bots for the simple reason that any shred of information that goes out has the potential to hurt our efforts. Simply put, the safer botters and bot-makers feel, the more likely we are to catch them. Minutes count with these sorts of things. Using made-up numbers here, but just for illustration: a new detection method that catches 50 botters could have only been 5 or none if the botters had any reason to believe there might be something coming.

I completely understand why that's a crappy response, but we have to use every single advantage we can get here, and that means being relatively quiet about an issue that's obviously very important -- both to the community, and to us.

As to the question of "player reporting vs Blizzard detection," that's not something we're taking an either/or response to. We're constantly working on improving our detection methods. That doesn't mean that player reports don't help.

Can you make reporting players easier? The only option right now that I know of is to report them mid arena game which isn't always possible.
We absolutely need to do better about getting this information out there, but the best method to report players you suspect are using a bot or hack -- especially if you can gather some video evidence -- is to email hacks@blizzard.com. That email address is monitored constantly by the team responsible for investigating such things. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

so after the last quest do Misprinted Draenic Coins have no use?
Correct. They have no use once you've completed the final quest. WarcraftDevs
