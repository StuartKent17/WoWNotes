Legion adds the Wardrobe system, allowing you to collect appearances without holding on to the items! <br>
<br>
<br>
Void Storage still exists and is unchanged.<br>
You need to visit a Transmogrification NPC to hide your cloak, helm, or shoulders now. <br>
A new tab has been added to the collections pane, allowing you to browse all of the appearances wherever you are in game. <br>
You can filter by collected and uncollected appearances, as well as weapon types and appearance sources. <br>
You can save sets and apply them to all specs or just a specific spec, causing your transmog to change with your spec. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Interface Options<br>
Many of the interface options were removed from the UI in Legion. You can use the AdvancedInterfaceOptions addon (http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/advancedinterfaceoptions) to access them now.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Character Pane<br>
The stats in the character pane were greatly simplified in Leigon.<br>
<br>
<br>
The developers confirmed (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/409185-new-character-pane-stats-window/#post7) that no alternative view is planned<br>
You can use the DejaCharacterStats addon (http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/dejacharacterstats) to restore some of the functionality. <br>

Nameplates, unit frames, and other parts of the combat UI got an upgrade.<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Maps<br>
There were lots of updates to the flight path map and a few to the minimap.<br>

The flight path map for the Broken Isles is larger, allowing you to zoom in to individual zones and pan around the map. <br>
World quests are shown on the Broken Isles flight path map. <br>
Undiscovered flight paths are shown on the map.<br>
The minimap now displays if something is above or below you, as well as greying out things that are not outside, such as NPCs in a building or cave.<br>

Professions<br>
The professions UI got some upgrades to make it easier to use. <br>
<br>
<br>
The professions pane is now split, with a recipe list on the left and the description and materials on the right. <br>
The window shows the current rank you have unlocked for a recipe, with higher ranks making crafting cheaper or gathering more rewarding.<br>

Unlearned recipes provide some information about where to learn them and the cost. <br>
New categories have been added. <br>
