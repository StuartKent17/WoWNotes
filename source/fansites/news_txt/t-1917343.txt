Legion Alpha - Voice Acting
VO work is ongoing! I can't say to the extent that is remaining, but we're definitely not at 100% yet.

As VO comes in, feel free to enter bug reports for things like the following:


Sound files that cut each other off during a back and forth conversation sometimes we get the duration wrong so it'll become a shouting match
Sound files that don't match the written text
Sound files that can't be heard from a reasonable distance



Blue Tweets
Character / Items
Could the ability be Strike of the Windlord since the weapon lore says Al'akir imbued the weapon with his power?
Good call. We'll address this. craig_amai 

PvP
with the removal of honor in Legion, will we be able to purchase old pvp armor for transmog with gold?
That's one option we're considering, but haven't made a final decision yet. Rest assured, they'll be available somehow. WarcraftDevs 

any plans for gladiator mounts and titles to finally become account wide? Only seems fair with all the account wide pve stuff.
No such plans, no. WarcraftDevs 

Will item level matter regarding stats in low level PvP?
Yes, in a similar manner to max-level PvP. The stat difference will be considerably smaller. WarcraftDevs 

As a major transmogrification and PvP enthusiast, will there still be "Elite" transmogable gear for PvP in Legion?
Gear awarded at higher rating will continue to have the "Elite" designation and appearance. WarcraftDevs 

will pvp tabards be account wide with the new transmog system?
We have no plans to change how the PvP tabards are bound. WarcraftDevs 

Transmogrification
Sorry if this is a repeat: all items from completed quests are auto-added to wardrobe. Does this include Draenor treasures?
You will get credit for any one-time treasures in the same manner as a quest. WarcraftDevs
