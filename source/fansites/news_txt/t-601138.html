- Added the missing Motes of Fire farming spots on Shadowmoon and Blade&apos;s Edge Mountains maps<br>
- Added the list of the loots of Karazhan and Gruul&apos;s Lair bosses, I will update Kazzak/Doomwalker just after I posted this news.<br>
<br>
You will probably see some improvements on the raid strategies section, working on a few nice things and trying to put online more maps/strategy diagrams. Stay tuned !<br>
