Tauren Heritage Armor Unlock Clarification
Hey all, so I have a 120 Tauren who is Exalted with Thunder Bluff. Thing is, he is an alt, so he has almost no quest-line progression through BFA. My question is, do I need to do the War-Campaign to a certain point with him to be able to unlock the new set? I don’t really want to do it again, but if I have to do it to unlock the set I will…I can’t seem to find a definitive answer on this. Any ideas?
You can use your main character to finish the Campaign questline, and then switch over to your Tauren and start the Heritage Armor questline.



Arena Patch Note Clarification
Arena

Players now must always cast escape abilities before leaving combat e.g. Vanish and Shadowmeld.



How in the world is this listed under bug fixes? As if arenas since TBC should never have allowed people to get out of combat?? This is a major change and should be listed at the top of PvP changes with developer reasoning. This is a major deal and completely changes the meta of many comps in 2v2 and 3v3. Please can we get a post discussing this change? This is quite clearly being snuck in as a bug fix rofl.
We’re updating this note. It will now read:

Fixed a bug that could cause players who were actively participating in PvP combat to unintentionally drop combat.
