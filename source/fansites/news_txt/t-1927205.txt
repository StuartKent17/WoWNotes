Legion - Demonsaber Mount
Legion adds a Demonsaber http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/193007-demonsaber mount, which is currently listed as a Demon Hunter mount. Currently Demon Hunters only gain access to the Felsaber http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/200175-felsaber mount on the Alpha, but several NPCs were riding Demonsabers during the Demon Hunter intro experience.

Blizz didn't learn from Love Rocket RNG, and this is significantly worse.
I wouldn't say it's a lack of learning, more "hey this is a new concept illusions, how desired is it?" Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/680685007283732480

Heroes of the Store
We didn't get around to posting about the movie contest winner during Blizzcon, but it is definitely worth a watch! The same group also put out a Legion features recap https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYS7A9Qm33I of sorts.
