However, it means I&apos;ve got plenty of time to gather informations from everywhere and make nice, long posts.<br>
<br>
Today&apos;s news is the first part of the &quot;World of Warcraft 2008&quot; news, during the next few days I&apos;ll post compilations of all the things you can expect for 2008, and will most likely go with this schedule :<br>
28 December - Patch 2.3.2<br>
29 December - Patch 2.4<br>
30 December - Wrath of the Lich King<br>
<br>
I might split the Wrath of the Lich King post in 2 parts over two days, because I&apos;m still unsure of how big it will be. Also, the year might end with an &quot;important&quot; announcement, stay tuned !<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
World of Warcraft 2008 - Patch 2.3.2<br>
<br>
Patch 2.3.2 will be the first patch of 2008 and will be shortly followed by a minor bugfix patch (2.3.3). Even if it&apos;s not a major patch there are a few interesting changes here, and some interesting class balancing. (And this also give me one more day to work on the 2.4 and WotLK posts *cough*)<br>
<br>
Schedule<br>
PTR release - It&apos;s already here ! <br>
Live release - Most likely during January<br>
<br>
General<br>
Boat and zeppelin vendors and NPCs are are back on duty.<br>
Reduced network latency by disabling the Nagle algorithm.<br>
/timetest is a command that can be run to provide information on game performance. /timetest 0 turns the command off. When the command is issued, the next time a player uses a flight master to travel, certain statistics will be measured and displayed at the end of that flight. All weather effects and spawns are shutdown during the test.<br>
Effects triggered from being critically hit: Many abilities and talents were changed in 2.3.0 to allow them to trigger from critical strikes that occurred while the player benefitting from them was sitting.<br>
Quest givers with blue question marks no longer show up on the minimap.<br>
NPC&apos;s who you have completed a quest for will display a question mark on mouseover rather than an exclamation point.<br>
The bank controls for the guildmaster level of a guild is now grayed out. A guildmaster always has full access to a guild bank and this cannot be changed.<br>
A &quot;Withdraw-Repair Only&quot; button has been added to the guild bank controls. If this is set for a guild rank, then that rank cannot actually withdraw funds from the guild bank, but they can still use that daily amount of money for repairs.<br>
You will now automatically stand up when attacked, even if the attack doesn&#x2019;t land.<br>
<br>
