WoWModelViewer - Updated item list<br>
If you&apos;ve been browsing this site for more than 2 weeks, you probably know what&apos;s WoWModelViewer. If you don&apos;t, it&apos;s a software used to browse through ingame models of items/characters/buildings/spells/things. <br>
<br>
The other purpose of this software is to let you preview your gear on a character in a much better way than the ingame dressup room, but there is a slight problem with it : it requires a complete item list. Lately the official WMV site hasn&apos;t been updated with one, but hopefully users from the WoWModelViewer forums (http://www.wowmodelviewer.org/index.php?option=com_smf&amp;Itemid=44&amp;topic=1147.0) are working hard to keep it updated. <br>
<br>
How to install and update WoWModelViewer<br>
1. Download WoWModelViewer from its official site (http://www.wowmodelviewer.org/index.php?option=com_remository&amp;Itemid=35&amp;func=fileinfo&amp;id=24) (and not from anywhere else)<br>
2. Download the updated list on the forum post linked above, or just get it here (http://azeroth.mmo-champion.com/media/updated_items.csv)<br>
3. Delete your old items.csv and replace it with the updated_items.csv (Rename it to items.csv)<br>
4. Launch, enjoy (http://azeroth.mmo-champion.com/media/wmview.jpg). http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/siteImages/images/ (http://azeroth.mmo-champion.com/media/wmview.jpg)<br>

Addon - WoWEquip<br>
Another extremely useful addon today, WoWEquip ! <br>
<br>
What does it do ?<br>
That&apos;s an ingame profiler, it will preview the stats of your character and let you switch any items to see how it affects all your stats. <br>
<br>
Installation<br>
Download WoWEquip (http://files.wowace.com/WoWEquip/WoWEquip.zip), extract in your addons folder as usual.<br>
Once in game, type /wowequip<br>
Right click any item to change it by another one just by searching its name. <br>
Left click items to enchant/socket items. <br>
If you can&apos;t find an item, it&apos;s because your game never &quot;saw&quot; the item, if you really want to get it on the list of available items get the itemID from Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/) (the itemID is the 4 or 5 digits number at the end of the adress of the item page) and query it through the interface available in the item list of WoWEquip.<br>
