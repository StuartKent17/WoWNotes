Patch 7.1.5 PTR - Artifact Knowledge<br>
Patch 7.1.5 makes catching up on Artifact Knowledge easier for new players and alts!<br>
<br>
New Players / Main Character Catch Up<br>
<br>
The Artifact Research Synopsis (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/144395-artifact-research-synopsis) allows you to turn in (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/46125-furthering-knowledge) 500 x Order Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources) for one Artifact Knowledge level, up to 15. <br>
These are BoP items, so you can only use them on the character you complete the quest on. <br>
<br>
<br>
Alt Characters<br>
<br>
The Artifact Research Compendium items are sold by the Artifact Knowledge researcher in your Order Hall for 1000 x Order Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources). <br>
These are BoA items, so you can purchase them on your main character to send to alts. <br>
These only allow you to purchase a book with lower Artifact Knowledge than your current Artifact Knowledge level. <br>
For example, characters with Artifact Knowledge from 15-19 can purchase Artifact Research Compendium: Volumes I &amp; II (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/144434-artifact-research-compendium-volumes-i-ii), granting their alt Artifact Knowledge 10.<br>

Legion Season 1 Ending Clarifications<br>
With today&#x2019;s announcement of the end of Legion&#x2019;s first PvP season on December 13, we&#x2019;d like to clarify a few extra details.<br>
<br>
The Elite PvP gear appearance will be the same in Legion Season 2 as it is in Season 1. If you are unable to complete your set in Season 1, you&#x2019;ll still be able to collect your missing appearances during Season 2.<br>
<br>
Additionally, after Legion Season 2 concludes, we&#x2019;ll be adding the ability to purchase the complete Elite appearance set from a vendor. This will only be made available to players who have earned access to the Elite set by reaching a PvP rating of 2000 or higher in any Rated Battleground or Arena bracket during Legion Season 1 or 2.<br>
<br>
Finally, we&#x2019;d like to clarify that the end of Legion Season 1 and beginning of Legion Season 2 are not tied in any way to the release of Patch 7.1.5. One of our major goals for Rated PvP in Legion is to have PvP seasons change over more regularly, which means we can now transition between seasons without requiring a patch. This transition will occur prior to the release of Patch 7.1.5.<br>
<br>

FEEDBACK: Lower Nighthold (Heroic)<br>
We&apos;re opening up the Nighthold raid on PTR, with Skorpyron, Chronomatic Anomaly, Trilliax, and Spellblade Aluriel available on Heroic difficulty. We&apos;ll be leaving these bosses up for a couple of days. Please use this thread to for feedback or bug reports on any of the encounters. When providing tuning feedback, please note the nature of your raid group (e.g. Mythic guild group, PUG, etc.).<br>
<br>
<br>
Nighthold Testing<br>
Watcher explain why we should test your dungeon you don&apos;t listen to feedback<br>
Well, part of the point of opening Nighthold and leaving it open for a longer period of time is to let groups get in and give contextual feedback on class mechanics, as well as to gather data to help with tuning. If we were solely interested in polishing the encounters, we&apos;d be doing short 1-hour tests that could be observed by the encounter design team in their entirety. But this approach lets a lot more people get in and try things out.<br>
<br>
Basically no numerical tuning based on 7.1.5 changes has been done yet: in test builds and development, the primary initial focus tends to be on qualitative design changes, both to allow for time to iterate on them, and because there&apos;s a much smaller development window during which we can make large changes to text in tooltips (since everything needs to be translated for the game&apos;s different regions before a patch can be finalized). Numbers changes are best done when designs are closer to final (there&apos;s little point fine-tuning something that may get ripped out entirely next build), and can be done very late in the PTR cycle. Raid tests like this help tremendously with that process.<br>
<br>
The past couple of weeks have been full of distractions, with a long holiday weekend in the middle, and we haven&apos;t done a great job of communicating regarding the 7.1.5 class and systems changes. We&apos;ll be working to correct some of that in the coming days, but I understand that there&apos;s more than a little frustration and distrust to overcome.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, I&apos;ll rename this thread, and make a new one for Nighthold. Please try to keep that one clear for feedback and logs from the instance, so that everyone can have a more polished experience in the long run. Thanks.<br>
<br>

Patch 7.1.5 Warlock Feedback<br>
Feedback: you&apos;re leaving the warlock community out in the cold. Please communicate with us. We are extremely desperate.<br>
We agree with a number of the core concerns raised, but don&apos;t have immediate solutions (or those solutions will take more time to design, implement, and test than the 7.1.5 PTR cycle affords). A couple of examples off the top of my head:<br>
<br>
<br>
Steady/predictable Ember generation suited the Destruction rotation well, and something important was lost in the course of unifying the class to use a single shared resource, but fixing that at this point isn&apos;t just as simple as rolling everything back to Embers.<br>
Mechanics like Demonic Empowerment and Soul Effigy are cumbersome to manage and while they have strong spec-specific theming, the actual gameplay of using them drags down their respective specs.<br>
<br>
<br>
We&apos;re probably too reluctant to acknowledge problems for which we don&apos;t yet have a solution to present. But the fact that we haven&apos;t yet changed something doesn&apos;t mean that we think it&apos;s perfect as-is.<br>
