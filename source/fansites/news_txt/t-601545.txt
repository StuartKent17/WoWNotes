Website
wobbles pointed out on the forum http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=483.0 that the RSS feed of the site sucks, and I totally agree with him. The feed was previously limited to 255 characters and it wouldn't show many infos about the news in your favorite RSS feed reader. I pushed this limit to 4000, I hope this will be enough. Reminder : News RSS Feed is here http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?type=rss;action=.xml;board=2.0;sa=news;.

Comics
Horde comic from Blizzard website !
