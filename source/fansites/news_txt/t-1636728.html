Message from J. Allen Brack<br>
WoW Community: <br>
<br>
I know how much everyone was looking forward to this expansion, and once you were able to get in and start having fun, all the comments I&apos;ve seen indicate that this is one of our best yet. But the quality of the content does not excuse the subpar launch experience we delivered, and I apologize for that.<br>
<br>
The first two days of the expansion were not a great experience, with many of you facing high queues or significant gameplay problems. We worked around the clock to tackle the demand issues and technical challenges, and fortunately things started looking better on Saturday. While millions of you were able to get in and play over the weekend, with many already reaching level 100, others still ran into very lengthy queues, particularly on the highest-population realms.<br>
<br>
To help address this, we&#x2019;ve expanded the new instancing tech we used to improve queues on Saturday and we&#x2019;re continuing the process of applying that to raise the capacity of all realms again. This will result in approximately double the prelaunch capacity on each realm, which should greatly reduce queue times for most realms if not eliminate queues altogether.<br>
<br>
In recognition of the difficulties so many of you ran into when trying to play over the first few days, we&apos;re adding five days&#x2019; worth of extra time to every subscription in the Americas, Oceania, and Europe that was active as of Friday, November 14. Things are already in a much better place than they were going into the weekend, so I hope you&#x2019;ll now be able to focus on having a ton of fun with this expansion.<br>
<br>
I also hope you&apos;ll accept my apology and keep your faith in us. The support voiced by many of you as we worked through the challenges was immensely appreciated. We&apos;re extremely grateful to be part of such a passionate community. We love World of Warcraft, and we&apos;re very proud of this expansion, so stumbling out of the gates like this was very disappointing for all of us.<br>
<br>
On behalf of the World of Warcraft development team, as well as everyone at Blizzard, thank you all again for your patience and understanding.<br>
<br>
See you in Draenor.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
J. Allen Brack <br>

6.0.3 Hotfixes: November 18<br>
Blizzard is working on (https://twitter.com/Rygarius/status/534911211284856832) a hotfix for Tier 2 Trading Posts not unlocking rep gains with Sha&apos;tari Defense or Laughing Skull.<br>
Garrisons, Followers, and Outposts<br>
<br>
Fishing Shack: The building should now correctly still provide a bonus while it&apos;s under construction.<br>
Frostwall Mine: Fixed a number of True Iron Deposits that were spawning inside of pillars and terrain.<br>
Mage Tower/Spirit Lodge: Characters under a shapeshifting effect should now be able to use an Ogre Waygate to return to their Garrisons.<br>
Outpost, Nagrand: The building bonus for having a Corral should no longer incorrectly dismount Herbalists while harvesting resource nodes.<br>
[Requires a realm restart.] Outpost, Spires of Arak: Bonus for the building should now switch correctly when changing buildings for the outpost.<br>
Salvage Yard: The building should now correctly still provide a bonus while it&apos;s under construction.<br>

Empowered Moonkin&apos;s clearcasting effect should no longer be incorrectly consumed if it&apos;s triggered while the Moonkin is in the middle of casting a spell.<br>

<br>
Talents<br>
<br>
[Requires a realm restart.] Holy Shield should now correctly deal damage when blocking normal attacks as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quests<br>
<br>
Bonus Objective: The Forgotten Caves: Gorg the Host should no longer be getting stuck in evade mode.<br>
Bonus Objective: The Howling Crag: Further increased the spawn rates of Pale Orcs and Rylak Eggs.<br>
For the Children!: Manastorm&apos;s Duplicator should now be correctly awarded to characters that complete the quest.<br>
Moving In: Characters that abandon the quest should now have an easier time reacquiring the quest and resume their progress on the main quest line.<br>
Ogre Diplomacy: Players that have completed Into the Heart of Madness should no longer sometimes be placed into an incorrect phase and be unable to complete the quest.<br>
Safety Measures: Increased the spawn rate of bog denizens.<br>
Shadowmoon Invasion! is now automatically removed from the character&apos;s quest log if they upgrade to a Tier 3 Garrison as this quest is only available for Tier 2 Garrisons.<br>
Skimming Off The Top: Increased the drop rates for Volatile Oil.<br>
Strike While the Iron is Hot: Blocked off the entrance to the Iron Docks so players won&apos;t accidentally wander out of the quest area and wind up getting lost.<br>
The Defense of Karabor: Players resurrecting at a graveyard during this quest should no longer be immediately attacked by Iron Horde NPCs.<br>
The Iron Wolf: Players should now be able to receive completion credit if they&apos;ve died and released during the quest.<br>

<br>
<br>
Creatures and NPCs<br>
<br>
Apexis Traders Dawn-Seeker Krek (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/86391-dawn-seeker-krek) (Alliance) and Dawn-Seeker Alkset (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/86382-dawn-seeker-alkset) (Horde) are now offering Exceptional gear (item level 645 (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=645&amp;filter-ilvl-max=645&amp;filter-source=16384)) for sale.<br>
<br>
Developer Commentary: The vendors&apos; offerings were previously tied to the Highmaul raid unlock, but we wanted to make sure that players have useful items to spend their Apexis Crystals on, rather than positioning them exclusively as a catch-up item vendor. The final tier of Flawless gear (item level 655 (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=655&amp;filter-ilvl-max=655&amp;filter-source=16384)) will now unlock when the Highmaul raid becomes available, rather than when Blackrock Foundry becomes available.<br>
<br>
Increased the spawn rates for creatures and NPCs in the Skettis Ruins area in Spires of Arak. [Requires a realm restart.] Additionally, resolved an issue where some creatures were incorrectly sharing loot with other players.<br>
Grizzled Frostwolf Veteran&apos;s icon should no longer persist on the mini map after being defeated.<br>
Rangari Jonaa now has a cooldown on their Scatter Shot ability.<br>
Rotcap&apos;s icon should no longer persist on the mini map after being defeated.<br>
Typhon&apos;s icon should no longer persist on the mini map after being defeated.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeons, Raids, and Scenarios<br>
<br>
Characters with Warlords PvP gear that had its secondary item level activated due to being in PvP combat temporarily disqualifies them from queuing for Dungeons and Raid Finder. It can take up to 20 seconds after ending PvP combat before the character will be eligible to queue up normally.<br>
Upper Blackrock Spire<br>
<br>
During the Commander Tharbek encounter, players should no longer be kept in a constant state of combat between waves.<br>
<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
<br>
Reverted a hotfix from October 15 that reduced all PvP damage by 25%.<br>
Gnomes are now able to increase their reputation with Wrynn&apos;s Vanguard.<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Coil of Sturdy Rope, a Horde quest item should no longer be incorrectly dropping for Alliance characters.<br>
Miner&apos;s Coffee movement speed buff should now stack correctly with other movement speed buffs.<br>
Solium Band (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Solium+Band) rings can now be equipped at level 98 (down from level 100).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Legendary Ring Quest Line and Apexis Crystals<br>
Here to provide additional clarification on the hotfix note that went out yesterday, November 17.<br>
<br>
Quests<br>
<br>
Draenor&apos;s Secret Power: Completion of this quest is now required before being able to move onto the next step of the Legendary quest chain. For characters that skipped this quest, completion of this quest has also been made into a requirement before being eligible for the next upgrade.<br>
<br>
<br>
This means players that skipped the quest will still have to complete Draenor&apos;s Secret Power before being eligible for the next upgrade. That last part wasn&apos;t included until now cause I was tunnel visioning on hotfixes and glossed over the supplemental email for the change. Hope this clears any confusion up.</div></div>
