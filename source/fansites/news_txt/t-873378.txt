Unholy

Desecration http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/55667/desecration/ no longer triggers when an applicable strike hits a snare-immune target. This is primarily to avoid unnecessary spell effect clutter during boss encounters.

Enhancement

Improved Fire Nova has been redesigned and replaced by a talent called Seasoned Winds http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/16544/seasoned-winds/. When an enemy spell cast is successfully prevented with Wind Shear http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/57994/wind-shear/, the shaman gains magical resistance in an amount equal to what a protection totem/aura would grant, stacking with such buffs to the spell schools of the interrupted spell except for Holy spells, lasting 10 seconds.
