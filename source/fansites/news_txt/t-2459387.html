Frightened Kodo Mount Guide<br>
Most of the 8.1 Darkshore rare mounts drop from specific rare mobs around the map much like the Arathi rare mounts. However, the Frightened Kodo (https://www.wowdb.com/items/166433-frightened-kodo) is acquired a little differently. Here is what we have learned about obtaining this mount:<br>

Frightened Kodo (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/148790-frightened-kodo) is a rare spawn on a timer (reportedly anywhere from 2-6 hours)<br>
It is a friendly NPC that must be clicked. You will receive the message &quot;Frightened Kodo nuzzles your hand. He wants to come with you!&quot; and the mount will be placed into your bags several seconds later.<br>
Only the first person who clicks the spawned mob will receive the mount. It despawns shortly after being clicked or if no one clicks it within about 2 minutes.<br>
It has 6 known spawn locations, all of which are marked on the map above. (You can find a waypoint macro on the Warcraft Secrets website (https://warcraft-secrets.com/guides/battle-for-darkshore-rewards).)<br>

38.0 66.0<br>
39.2 56.5<br>

<br>
Server resets seem to be a good time to check for a spawn.<br>
It is lootable by class trials and level 110&apos;s on both factions.<br>
It does not matter which faction controls Darkshore for it to spawn or be obtainable.<br>

Feedback: Island Expeditions<br>
There were a number of changes to Island Expeditions in the Tides of Vengeance content update. Now that they have been live for several weeks, we wanted to take a moment and get your thoughts on them. It can be about anything you have experienced but here are some questions to open things up: How have the changes felt? Have things improved? Has anything gotten worse? What rewards have you been getting?<br>
If you haven&#x2019;t tried Islands out at all since the latest content update, before commenting please go ahead and try out a few and let us know what you experienced. Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts and Happy New Year!

Holy Paladin Gameplay<br>
Cleave healing. A lot of people still think we&#x2019;re &#x201C;tank healers&#x201D; but we actually aren&#x2019;t. At least not directly. If you directly heal the tanks you&#x2019;re going to lose a lot of healing. This is due to how beacons work. Our niche is cleave healing and triage healing. We always heal 3 targets for the price of 1 with beacons and even up to 7 targets with LoD if you don&#x2019;t directly hit your beacons. This helps smooth out tank damage quite a bit while allowing you to heal other people rather than focus solely on the tanks. The only time you&#x2019;d directly heal tanks is if they&#x2019;re getting destroyed and they really need extra focus but tank healing is better done from a mistweaver now. Our cleave healing is fairly good<br>
A huge misconception is that pallies are &quot;just&quot; tank healers. I was still going of this old mentality for awhile as well but now more than ever our niche is pretty well defined in a raid. If you&#x2019;re doing it right we&#x2019;re keeping tanks stable and spot healing the rest of the raid allowing us to pick up spots where AoE healing isn&#x2019;t cutting it from the rest of the classes.

Heart of Azeroth necklace not account wide?<br>
What weekly reduction? Oh that thing you paused a while back to increase time played metrics so people have to regrind stuff they already had when the raid launches.<br>
Ion already spoke at length about this in the last Q&amp;A but we admit it doesn&#x2019;t feel good. The lack of reduction really only negatively affects very high end players pushing for absurdly high Azerite levels, we&#x2019;re talking 40-44 (looking at you Myppoo you insane person you). For anything under that the levels are still within reasonable amounts to gain another level, plus 37-38 is all that you need to get ring 3 on even Mythic Dazar&#x2019;alor gear.<br>
<br>
We know it doesn&#x2019;t feel good to put in more work to unlock the exact same traits you just had, and we said in the last Q&amp;A that we&#x2019;re working on that.
