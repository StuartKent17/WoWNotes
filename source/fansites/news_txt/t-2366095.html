Patch 7.3.5 - Artifact Instability<br>
Patch 7.3.5 adds the send off for our Artifact weapons (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7235-Patch-7-3-5-Artifact-Weapon-Ending-World-Changes-Command-Boards-New-Racial-Icons). A recent PTR build added some visual effects of the instability that results from the send off.<br>
<br>
The latest build also changed how the Artifact Power numbers increase or decrease once your Artifact is unstable. Now your Artifact will increase in (displayed) Artifact Power until February 2nd, then the total Artifact Power displayed will decrease until March 2nd. On March 19 it will begin to increase very very rapidly.<br>

This Week in WoW History<br>
We&apos;re taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br>
<br>
Mists of Pandaria: Pet Battles<br>
Pet Battles were added in Mists of Pandaria and are still around today. This new content allowed players to collect battle pets and face off against other players, trainers or battle pets. The initial design had some features such as certain pets only spawning under very specific conditions (i.e - time of day or weather). The basics of the system were a level 25 cap with 6 total abilities.<br>

<br>
Spell Animations in Patch 5.2<br>
Warlocks, Rogues and Monks got updated spell animations on this PTR build. The spells that were updated were Nimble Brew, Ring of Peace, Hit and Run, Marked for Death and Blood Fear. Some of these abilities, such as Ring of Peace, have been updated in later patches as well.<br>

Swift Windsteed<br>
The newest addition to the Blizzard Store was the Swift Windsteed, which is the Pandaria themed mount floating on a cloud. As with all store mounts, this one scales with riding skill and is available to all characters on the account that purchase it.<br>

Chinese Gaming Theme Park<br>
China opened a theme park which featured a variety of gaming titles. In 2013, a Reddit user shared some pictures from their trip to the park, which had a few Warcraft and Starcraft features.<br>

<br>
Patch 6.1<br>
The first content patch of Warlords of Draenor brought small updates to a variety of systems as well as Twitter functionality within World of Warcraft. After the new character models were implemented, there were a few complaints which got fixed during this update. We also saw the addition of the Heirloom tab to make it easier to navigate and create heirlooms on alt characters. The Death Recap panel also got a small upgrade which made it easier to figure out what killed you during combat.<br>

<br>
Patch 7.1.5<br>
The first major balance patch of Legion brought a large number of changes to the game. The most important was the increase of secondary stats on jewelry. Secondary stat amounts on jewelry were increased to make them have a larger overall impact on stats since jewelry doesn&apos;t have primary stats. This patch also brought two new pieces of content with the addition of Mists of Pandaria Timewalking and the return of the Brawler&#x2019;s guild. Hunter traps and the Mage Barriers also got new animations to better fit the specs.<br>
