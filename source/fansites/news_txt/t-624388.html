TwentyFifthNovember, the guild created by members from both Nihilum (http://www.nihilum.eu) and SK-Gaming (http://www.sk-gaming.com) is now officialy known as Ensidia (http://www.ensidia.com). We&apos;ll probably hear about them again in a few weeks/months after the release of Patch 3.1 introducing the new Ulduar raid instance. <br>
<br>
Ensidia (http://www.ensidia.com/?p=1) is a joint effort by members of two of the top guilds in World of Warcraft, with the support and endorsement of a private entity based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Our guilds have made being at the forefront of PVE progression our modus operandi since the first installment of this game and, as Ensidia, we will continue to do so.<br>
<br>
In addition, within the week, we will launch a guild web portal that will:<br>
<br>
Be the hub for our guild members and likeminded folk.<br>
Provide for the sizable hardcore/moderate population in our community.<br>
Evolve to fit the complex tastes and needs of the WoW community in general.<br>
<br>
Check back here over the next few days.</div></div>
