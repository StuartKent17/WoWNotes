Patch 4.0.6 PTR Notes - January 14 Update<br>
It&apos;s a bird? It&apos;s a plane? No! It&apos;s another PTR Notes Update! If you&apos;re looking for me, I&apos;ll be leveling my warlock. <br>
<br>
For those of you asking, Honor Trade Goods vendors are on PTRs but they don&apos;t have any item for sale, we&apos;ll have to wait for the next PTR build to get a list of prices I guess. (or a blue post, maybe)<br>
Guilds<br>
<br>
Once a guild hits level 23, the daily cap on experience gained is removed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Racials<br>
<br>
The gnomish racial trait Escape Artist now has a 1.5-minute cooldown, down from 1.75. In addition, it is now possible to use and waste this ability when not snared or rooted. This is consistent with other dispels.<br>

Fel Armor (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/28176/fel-armor/) has been redesigned. It now surrounds the caster with fel energy, increasing spell power and causing the warlock to be healed for 3% of any single-target spell damage he or she deals.<br>

Engineering<br>
<br>
Mystic Cogwheel (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/68660/mystic-cogwheel/) is a new Engineering Cogwheel gem which provides resilience rating and can be purchased from the Engineering vendor for 55 Honor Points.<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
The Honor Commodities and Justice Commodities Vendors now sell raw tradeskill materials. These are not intended to be a cost-effective source of these materials, but an option for players with lots of Justice or Honor Points who have already purchased all of the gear that interests them.<br>
Lich King trinkets with bonus armor values have been adjusted using the new Cataclysm formula, reducing their armor values substantially.<br>
<br>
<br>
Set Bonuses<br>
<br>
The PvE hunter 4-piece set bonus has been redesigned. It now reduces the cast time of Steady Shot (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/56641/steady-shot/) and Cobra Shot (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77767/cobra-shot/) by .2 seconds.<br>
All PvP 4-piece bonuses have had their flat stat values cut in half. Primary stats are very powerful in Cataclysm, so much so that players were considering using PvP gear in PvE just because of these primary stat bonuses.<br>
PvP hunter bonus change reverted<br>
PvP enchants are properly valued and attached to Honor Quartermasters and Tol Barad/Baradin Hold Quartermasters.<br>

/cancelauras and addons<br>
The patch note specifically refers to addons. A while back, we blocked addons from automatically (meaning without players pushing a button) removing auras. Our logic was that canceling auras should be a player decision and require player action. To be honest, we don&#x2019;t want canceling auras to be a huge part of the game period, but it has some niche uses mostly among high-end players and we are okay with that.<br>
<br>
In any case, what the patch note refers to is that addons can now cancel auras automatically outside of combat. Outside of combat, players are just using it for convenience and not for any kind of combat benefit. In this sense it is a buff not a nerf, but either way players can still use /cancelaura for their own personal macros &#x2013; they just have to hit the button.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m probably just going to remove the Addon section from the patch notes. Those notes really only make sense to addon authors, and we have a direct line of communication with most of them where we can share any changes from 4.0.6 which may affect how they create/update mods.

Entanglement<br>
The below post is correct. We will share additional information with you regarding our plans for Balance as soon as we can, though it&apos;ll probably have to wait until after the holiday weekend.<br>

Making Chakra a Stance<br>
We do see this a lot and understand why players find the idea so appealing -- it&apos;d be incredibly effective to shift effortlessly between AoE or single-target healing at the push of a button. But if we were to go that route, why have Chakra at all? Holy priests might as well have both bonuses as passive effects because there&apos;s no real commitment.<br>
<br>
The intent of Chakra is that you commit to single-target or AoE healing. It provides a meaningful choice where you need to use your knowledge of an encounter and coordinate with other players, as well as draw upon your experience and gut instinct as a priest. At the same time, it&apos;s not a permanent commitment the way choosing between Disc and Holy is locked in during combat. If you picked the wrong Chakra, or the situation changes, you don&#x2019;t have to wait that long to switch. It&#x2019;s also possible to use AoE spells during the single-target mode &#x2013; you&#x2019;re just not using your full bonus.

Leaders of the Horde and the Alliance, an Epic Short Fiction Series Continues&#x2026;.<br>
King Varian Wrynn, Queen Sylvanas Windrunner, King Genn Greymane, and Trade Prince Gallywix&#x2014;these are just a few of the leaders who continue to shape Azeroth&apos;s destiny. They are the embodiments of their races&apos; strongest traits... and at times their greatest failings. In the coming months, Blizzard Entertainment will be releasing short stories that will peer into the hearts of these legendary heroes and offer insight into what new trials might lie ahead as they lead their people in a world forever changed by the Cataclysm.<br>
<br>
The second story of this exciting series, &quot;Lord of His Pack (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/cataclysm/features/genngreymane.html)&quot; gazes into the mind of Genn Greymane, the strong-willed king of Gilneas. When his nation falls to the Forsaken, Genn and his fellow citizens set out across the perilous seas to find sanctuary with their night elf allies. It soon becomes apparent that the recent Cataclysm has not only ravaged the lands of Azeroth, but its oceans as well.<br>
<br>
In the midst of a great tempest threatening to tear the struggling fleet apart, the events that led to the loss of Genn&apos;s kingdom haunt him mercilessly. To weather both storms, Genn must come to terms with his past choices and face their results in his present.</div></div>
