<br>
Design was changed ... a lot. This will allow us to add more :<br>
Green, because it&apos;s a nice color.<br>
Content, dynamic menus are gonna make life easier.<br>
Advertising, no reason to not speak about it, hosting a site isn&apos;t free, and more money will be needed for the next features.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
During the next days, I&apos;ll try to change all the images from the old design (most of them are already changed), and I&apos;ll start updating the static content if Blizzard is nice enough to hold the patch a few more days.</div></div>
