If you ever wondered if you suck more than that other guy in your raid, or if your spec is just slightly underpowered compared to his on the boss you&apos;re currently fighting, RaidBots.com (http://raidbots.com/dpsbot/)&apos;s statistics is probably the answer to your questions!<br>
<br>
It features spec scores and DPS stats for all classes in the game based on WorldofLogs (http://worldoflogs.com/) parses and it should help you get an idea of how you&apos;re supposed to perform. You can also filter stats by boss/instance/difficulty through the menu on the right and if you&apos;re a little desperate, it might be an interesting way to know which classes you want to stack to defeat a specific boss ... but please don&apos;t hate me for saying that. <br>
<br>
The picture below is the current ranking of classes in 25-Man heroic mode, keep in mind that guilds are still working on those bosses and it will take a few more weeks for them to stabilize. And yes, the mages going up to 52000 DPS is most likely a bug from the Alysrazor fight, but I&apos;m going to point it out just in case. <br>

Masterwork Elementium Deathblade (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/70164/masterwork-elementium-deathblade/) changed to 3.5 Speed<br>
The reason for this confusion stemmed from a quirk in the way item hotfixes have to be applied, unfortunately. We hope to have the item&apos;s data completely corrected soon so others are not caught off guard by what the tooltip currently states.<br>
<br>
Yes, obviously Blizzard needs to fix the tooltip on the pattern and the item if they&apos;re not going to just make it 3.80 like it ought to be. But, I think the real question ought to be:<br>
<br>
Why isn&apos;t it 3.80 anyway?<br>
At 3.80 speed, the weapon was over-performing relative to its cost and the ease with which it can be obtained. <br>
<br>
[...] We wanted this weapon to be roughly on par with weapons from the previous tier, since it can be purchased from the Auction House. It wasn&apos;t intended to compete as much with current raid drops, as it felt weird that a strength-based DPS crafted weapon was more attractive than some of its counterparts.<br>
