Patch 5.4 - Kor&apos;kron Supplies<br>
One nice addition in Patch 5.4 that not many people have noticed is the Kor&apos;kron Supply crates (http://www.wowdb.com/objects/223521-korkron-supplies) scattered around the Dark Shaman area of the Siege of Orgrimmar. These boxes contain flasks and potions that aren&apos;t specific to your class or spec and are a nice way to supplement your guild&apos;s (or your own!) consumable supply. <br>

DPS/HPS logs should have never been added to the game. The cost is not justified by the benefit.<br>
It&apos;s nice to be able to evaluate your performance to fine tune gear or rotation. Agree the competitive aspect is out of control. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374970588487360512))<br>
<br>
This AM I saw: our DPS is too low, nobody wants us, we need an overhaul from pretty much every class. Those all can&apos;t be true. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374986824050962432))<br>
I think it&apos;s obv from buffs/nerfs through the exp cycle that it&apos;s obvious overhauls needed. Scaling is out of control<br>
Players obsess about scaling too much. OTOH even with perfect scaling, players would be unhappy if we didn&apos;t constantly tune balance (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375298008297922560))<br>
Put another way, even if all specs scaled identically with gear, encounter mechanics have a far greater impact on performance. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375298283435868160))<br>
<br>
I disagree. I think a support class fun as long as people knew up front that&apos;s what they were rolling.<br>
That&apos;s possible. Back in the MC days I suspect many players made their class decisions without that information. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374968597551910912))<br>
In fact, I suspect back in the MC days, many players didn&apos;t even consider the endgame until they got there. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374968686848643072))<br>
I will agree it was bullshit to find out that your feral was garbage. Less impressed with shaman/pally arguments tho.<br>
My original MC raid had at least 4 paladins that rolled to be melee DPS and were told they had to heal and buff in raids. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374978517634514944))<br>
<br>
Actually it&apos;s because the class has been switched upside down since launch<br>
Claiming we don&apos;t have a direction or vision for a class is generally a good way not to get us to read something. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374972660163162113))<br>
It&apos;s not that we are afraid of criticism; far from it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374972833446645760))<br>
We were pretty clear that Fistweaving was always a secondary mechanic, much like Atonement healing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374978074942529536))<br>
We never wanted to hear monks (or any healer) say &quot;I cannot stand with the other healers. I MUST be in melee.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374978158358831104))<br>
<br>
When people ask me what spec to play, I often tell them &quot;whatever you enjoy or can do the best at&quot; is this good advice?<br>
Yes. Most players worry far too much about theoretical max DPS. The success of *your* group is rarely dependent on it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373973081523367936))<br>
<br>
what u think of talent trees? do u really think ur playerbase wants to constantly switch talents every 5 seconds?<br>
We think they want to change talents once in awhile, versus the old model of never looking at the talent screen again. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374951663531855872))<br>
<br>
e.g. specialize on the talent level, not the class level, by providing talents that significantly favour single or AE healing?<br>
I think you would have to do something like: must have a shield healer and an AE healer, with 2-3 class choices each. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373969275641282560))<br>
The problem with talents, though we still do it sometimes, is AE usually wins in MoP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373969468826722304))<br>
It&apos;s really hard to get that &quot;glad we have a druid&quot; feel you&apos;re looking for without very strong / mandatory unique utility. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373969759382945792))<br>
A different design is that instead of tank, healer, DPS (ABC) you have ABCDE and a 10 needs two of each. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373970159645388800))<br>
The ABCDE model lets each class / spec feel powerful and unique but hurts the raid that likes to raid with e.g. 3 hunters. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373970314947870720))<br>
<br>
why all caster class haste make more DoT&apos;s Ticks, but meele and ranged this isn&apos;t happen??<br>
The intent is haste generally provides more resources for melee and hunters to deliver on the &quot;haste lets you do more&quot; concept. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378962938985316354))<br>

Example A: Deterrence doesn&apos;t work how it is supposed to work and is half as strong as it is supposed to be. no fix<br>

the question about female Demon Form is constantly dodged by Blues. Is this so hard to implement? Would make locks happy.<br>
Not that hard to implement, but it does take real artist time if it&apos;s more than just a bow on a Voidwalker. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/380065816164593664))<br>
but what if my voidwalker wants to wear a bow, even voidwalkers want to feel pretty.<br>
I&apos;m not judging. Each voidwalker can dress how he or she wants. I won&apos;t burden them with traditional gender norms. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/380088065336688640))<br>

Character / Items<br>
Can we remove Personal Loot from Flex, Getting the same item 4 weeks in a row in LFR is terrible design<br>
Sharding the same item 4 weeks in a row in heroic isn&apos;t all that fun either. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376881551167852544))<br>
so why are there capes dropping in heroic soo?<br>
Maybe one of your raiders decided to reroll and doesn&apos;t have an orange cloak? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377205353064046592))<br>
<br>
Hey Greg, would you be so kind and explain the drop-system of the new heirloom weapons?<br>
The first one you get will be for your loot spec. After that it&apos;s random. All are personal loot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376877561990488064))<br>
Is it the 1st one on each difficulty mode (F/N/H), or only the 1st one on the first difficulty mode you clear?<br>
The intent is per difficulty. We don&apos;t want someone e.g. avoiding N Garrosh for fear of wasting their chance. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376888397295411201))<br>

Flex Raiding<br>

Oustanding. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/381499429166936065))<br>
<br>
How many teeth are missing from the average Flex audience member? Are they shirtless? Have they been on &quot;COPS&quot;?<br>
Our hope is that they are pretty normal players who put a premium on playing with friends and family over progression. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376887849628344321))<br>
A traditional raiding guild might boot a nice player with low DPS. The intended flex audience would never dream of it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376888081313304577))<br>
<br>
i will not use on principle its an attempt to kill lfr.<br>
It is not an attempt to kill LFR. It&apos;s an attempt to provide a more casual alternative to N for social groups who don&apos;t enjoy LFR. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373885346028605440))<br>
Flex just is not needed. There&apos;s already that... it&apos;s called 10-man. If guild can&apos;t form then they have bigger issues.<br>
We disagree. 10-player ToT is harder than 10-player ICC. The players who enjoyed the ICC level of difficulty are shut out. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374988919940464640))<br>
What was the rationale for the step-up in difficulty since Wrath? Did 10-man ICC feel too easy to devs?<br>
A series of steps. 1) Didn&apos;t want 10s to feel like 2nd class citizens, so we gave them the same ilevel. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375301972712112128))<br>
2) Didn&apos;t want same ilevel for easier difficulty, so we brought 10s up to the 25 level (overall - there is variety per boss). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375302077653606400))<br>
You can argue that those were both missteps, but that&apos;s how we arrived where we are today. Flex is trying to recapture ICC 10. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375302198206271488))<br>
