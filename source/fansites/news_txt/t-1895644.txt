World of Warcraft: Legion - Game Systems http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5257-World-of-Warcraft-Legion-Game-Systems

Artifact power comes from quest bosses, rare spawns, rare drops, dungeons, raids, battlegrounds, arenas. Used to unlock traits.
Hunters and Druids get special transportation networks in their halls, warriors have a sparring arena. 
Class themed Death Gate style spells to get to your class hall.
Talents will have less theme rows, more meaningful choices, more spec specific talents, hundreds of new talents!
Recipes have ranks, 1-3 star recipes. Rare, make you more efficient at crafting things. Less materials, shorter cooldown.
Lots of things to do with professions, shouldn't be running out of content.
Transmog - Clean up bank and inventory some more. More customization. A collection system.
Wardrobe - As soon as item is bound to you, appearance is unlocked. Once it is unlocked, you can get rid of it. Account wide! Have to be able to equip item to unlock it.

Hiding shoulders allowed!
Weapon enchants, shirts, and tabards for transmog! 

World of Warcraft Q&A http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5259-World-of-Warcraft-Q-A

The flying achievement will exist at launch, but you won't be able to complete it at launch. You can start progressing on it though.
A solution won't make it for launch, but some way to communicate with a cross-server group is something they are working on.
No new battleground, focus is on the new PvP progression system.
It would be ideal if you could be in multiple guilds at some point, one for PvP, one for Raids. Maybe a secondary guild system? Still in progress.
Legion will allow you to use all the specs, no longer limited to dual spec, each spec remembers your action bars and such.
Karazhan will be relevant in Legion. The secrets we need to beat the Burning Legion are in Karazhan. Karazhan could be a 5 player dungeon in Patch 7.1.
