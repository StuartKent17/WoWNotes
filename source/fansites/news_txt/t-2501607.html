The Patch 8.2.5 PTR has seen some changes to the faction embassies. The faction leaders have all left and only the Pandaren leaders remain with various representatives from the current allied races.<br>

Patch 8.2.5 PTR - Bee Mount Alliance Exclusive<br>
We knew going into the PTR that the bee mount was going to be an Alliance specific quest chain, but many assumed it would work much like Kua&apos;fon (https://www.wowdb.com/items/159146-kuafons-harness) and Child of Torcali (https://www.wowdb.com/items/168408-child-of-torcali) which are usable on Alliance even though the methods to obtain them are Horde exclusive. Currently on the PTR, the Honeyback Harvester&apos;s Harness (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/170069-honeyback-harvesters-harness) is the only bee mount in the mount journal and has the Alliance symbol next to it, meaning it is only rideable by Alliance characters. This could change, however, as the PTR is still early.<br>

Patch 8.2.5 PTR - New Addition to the Mount Journal Preview<br>
Currently on the PTR, when you preview a mount in the Mount Journal, you now see your character riding the mount!<br>

Patch 8.2.5 PTR - Party Sync New Quest Tracker UI Elements<br>
The Patch 8.2.5 PTR is currently testing the new party sync feature, and the quest tracker ui now has two new icons to let you know if you are replaying a quest you completed and whether or not you will receive bonus loot for participating.<br>
