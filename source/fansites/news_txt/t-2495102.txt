The debuff from Crucible of Flame Essence https://www.wowdb.com/spells/298605-the-crucible-of-flame no longer removes Rogues from stealth.

Items


Heart of Azeroth


Resolved an issue that caused Memory of Lucid Dreams Essence https://www.wowdb.com/spells/303412-memory-of-lucid-dreams to break the user’s stealth when refunding resources.
Memory of Lucid Dreams’ Essence https://www.wowdb.com/spells/303412-memory-of-lucid-dreams Major Power now correctly lasts the full duration for Fire Mages, Frost Mages, and Protection Paladins.

Developers’ note: The Minor Power on Memory of Lucid Dreams has a custom implementation for Fire Mages and how it interacts with Fire Blast charges. However, this wound up being too strong relative to other Essences’ Minor Powers. As such we’re reducing its proc rate by 33% for Fire Mages, which should keep this as a very strong option to use in the Minor Slot, but much closer to the potency of other Minor Powers.
