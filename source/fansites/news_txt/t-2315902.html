Game Developer Tweets<br>
From your answer about mistakes new game designers make you mentioned &#x201C;Not recognizing that they have reached a point of diminishing returns.&#x201D; Can you explain what that means?<br>
As a developer, there are a limited number of hours in the work week (even if you willingly work extra hours, which a lot of Rioters do). If you are spending your time on problem X, then you aren&#x2019;t spending your time on problem Y.<br>
<br>
If you get problem X to a solution that you would grade as an 85% in a day, and it takes you another day to get it to 90%, then you&#x2019;re only improving it by 5% a day compared to your original output of 85% a day. That&#x2019;s the diminishing returns part. Your efficiency drops to the floor, particularly compared to other projects you could be working on.<br>
<br>
Now I&#x2019;m not advocating shipping crappy, half-baked, or phoned-in designs. But in this business hitting 100% is almost never realistic, and the cost of hitting 100% isn&#x2019;t worth it when you consider the opportunity cost of what you&#x2019;re not doing in the same window. You have probably heard the phrase &#x201C;The enemy of good is perfect.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Junior designers mismanage this all the time. They get so excited about their project that they don&#x2019;t want to live within any constraints. They are completely focused on how awesome their project is and lose sight of the cost of that project (in terms of their time).<br>
<br>
I once spent several days setting up a battle between two NPCs that was just background action for players to make it feel like a battle was raging all around them. It looked really cool, but it took a long time to set up. If this was the climax of a big moment, then maybe that expenditure was worth it. Or maybe I should have spent that time to set up two different battles that would have more impact on players in the long run.<br>
<br>
Another way this manifests is when a junior designer spends too much time trying to save a flawed concept rather than recognizing that it probably can&#x2019;t be saved without weeks of work and that they would be better off to consider alternative concepts.
