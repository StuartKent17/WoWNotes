2.2 Patch notes are hidden somewhere here<br>
DoTs damages are now lowered by resilience. <br>
You get reputation and trash loots from trash mobs in Hyjal Summit. (Reputation from boss lowered a bit)<br>
Duration of crowd control spells, most of them have been reduced to 10 sec (Seduce, Freezing Trap, etc ...)<br>
You can now transmute Nexus Shards into Small Prismatic Shards. (You can also split 1 Large Prismatic into 3 Small Prismatic)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
People are getting banned from the official forums because of a Harry Potter Spoiler (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=301060195&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#12) (Don&apos;t click if you plan to read, obviously). Hopefully, this won&apos;t be our case, and we can finally give you the first spoiler : Harry Potter is a dwarf. <br>

<br>
<br>
Also, the change on the Blind skill was in the patch notes, but won&apos;t go live (and isn&apos;t even on the PTR it seems)<br>
<br>
This change is not implemented on the PTR and the note was removed. In short, the change was reverted at this point in time.<br>
