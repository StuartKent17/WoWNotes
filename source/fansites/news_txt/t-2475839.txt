Nerglish Translator Available Now
Blizzard has added the ability to translate any of their website pages into Nerglish! Just follow the instructions in the blue post below to bookmark the script and click it while on any Blizzard site to view the page in Nerglish.


  


We’re excited to announce that the official Blizzard websites are now fully localized for murloc players everywhere. One benefit of countless failed attempts at establishing peaceful relations with various murloc tribes is that we have finally unlocked the secrets of Nerglish syntax and grammar. Thanks to this breakthrough in human-to-murloc communication, murlocs everywhere will now be able to engage with their human counterparts on equal footing.
