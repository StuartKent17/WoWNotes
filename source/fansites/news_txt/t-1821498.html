Patch 6.2 - I Found Pepe! (Or Not!)<br>
Everyone&apos;s &lt;span title=&quot;or least favorite&quot;&gt;favorite bird&lt;/span&gt; got some new costumes and an achievement (I Found Pepe! (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10053-i-found-pepe)) in Patch 6.2. <br>
<br>
Interestingly, we haven&apos;t come across anyone with the achievement yet. There also have been no new Pepe NPCs (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs?filter-search=pepe) added to the database so far.<br>
<br>
So far, 1.31% of players have the What A Strange, Interdimensional Trip It&apos;s Been (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9838-what-a-strange-interdimensional-trip-its-been) achievement, up from 0.41% when we checked back in May.<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
Lore<br>
Probably dark shamans were in training until 5.3. Reasons similar to why he used other Horde races, I guess.<br>
Garrosh got crazier and more xenophobic after he brought the heart back to Org, influence of the old god (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/619937476145053700))<br>
didn&apos;t say he was immune due to the Divine Bell or some other Mogu method?<br>
Divine Bell was destroyed during Breath of Darkest Shadow iirc (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/619940930154446848))<br>
yes, but unless I misread the tweet, it was said that caused Garrosh to wield the heart without corruption<br>
He didn&apos;t get corrupted... at first. OG&apos;s can still mess with you mentally, e.g. your heart will explode. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/619949064717664256))<br>
<br>
Hey Muffinus, I recall you stating that fel magic uses souls, so would fel magic be both a form of chaos magic and soul magic?<br>
Some chaos magic does, some doesn&apos;t, some shadow magic does, some doesn&apos;t, it&apos;s like a reagent for some spells, e.g. Soulburn. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/619952369724362752))<br>

Reputation / Questing<br>
Personal, frequent, weekly story helps hide the grind. Is that difficult to include, and might we expect more next expansion?<br>
Ah, I normally try to avoid game specifics like that. I don&apos;t want my personal twitter to be another source of WoW news. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/619732666338795520))<br>
Yeah, we love making the more crafted story pieces to punctuate the max-level experience. We&apos;re aimed at more and better. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/619732737180590080))<br>
Difficult might not be the right word, but it&apos;s fair to say that they take time, so there are limits to how many we can craft. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/619732830801637376))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Developer Communication<br>
Why is the person it&apos;s easiest to get answers from regarding past and present WoW design philosophies someone who no longer works for the company and should be answering Qs from a much larger player base about an entirely different game?<br>
I answer the questions I get. I think a lot of WoW players still know who I am and League players are still discovering how to reach me. I&apos;d much prefer to talk about League. <br>
<br>
is communication from one person on a big game design team better or easier for designers interacting with players?<br>
Personally, I think it&apos;s better when everyone communicates. That&apos;s the Riot strategy. I think it feels authentic to players (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610819080019275777))<br>
I can also see why some prefer to use one person. Keeps other people from saying stuff you shouldn&apos;t say. But that also puts<br>
My entire department is encouraged, if not required, to get out there and talk to players. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610821104597233664))<br>
I&apos;d rather just clarify when someone errs than have a system designed to be so rigid that nobody ever makes a mistake. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610820694461448194))<br>
<br>
Game Design<br>
&quot;I could stay after work and make this a good game... Naaaaah.&quot; *faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaart*<br>
It&apos;s typically more &quot;I could fix this UI bug that happens in 0.5% of 5 year old graphic cards or I could add a new feature.&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610510409712340993))<br>
<br>
My professional opinion is that success has less to do with features and more to do with where the players are. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/605824062678392834))<br>
Right because players just mindlessly migrate, they don&apos;t care about things like &quot;features.&quot; God you are thick.<br>
It&apos;s not mindless at all. They tend to go where their friends are, and the switching cost of large groups of friends is high. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610511011406188544))<br>
This is not restricted to video games. History is full of better products that couldn&apos;t convince users to convert to them. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610511164011737090))<br>
OTOH, users will convert to new things that they didn&apos;t know they needed before. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610511280185552896))<br>
So my point was &apos;tis better to create a new niche than to try and shove someone out of an existing one. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610511394413285376))<br>
<br>
Do you think the constant queueing up and convenience system that WoW has now is better for an MMO? Should travelling exist?<br>
I have a love/hate relationship with queueing for any game, even League. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610819394956996610))<br>
Queuing provides an easy excuse not to make or play with friends. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610819606962253824))<br>
It also gives players motivation not to resolve problems since everyone is replaceable. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610819895106777088))<br>
And yet! So few players would play a game like League or WoW if we forced them to manually build a group. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610820023884513280))<br>
I know that&apos;s a cop out answer but I think about this a lot. At best you can provide better rewards for premades. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610820224946847744))<br>
Yet premades already come with a lot of inherent bonuses and it&apos;s still often too inconvenient. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610820368006184960))<br>
<br>
At the time you left WoW, comparing to the WoTLK days, was there a difference in the level of passion that the blizzard game designers had? I feel that over time they have grown less passionate and even complacent, and the result glaringly shows in WoD.<br>
I didn&apos;t notice a difference in passion from my point of view. Those guys pour their soul into their work. I&apos;m not up to speed on the design so I really don&apos;t feel like I can comment, but I wouldn&apos;t try to interpret it as the developers not caring. They care very much. Disappointing you kills them. <br>
