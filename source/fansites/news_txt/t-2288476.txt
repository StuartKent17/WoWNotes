Patch 7.3 adds Environeer Bert , a new trainer in Gnomeregan, as well as numerous new Battle Pets available for collection!


Patch 7.3 is introducing a new scaling tech which is being tested on Crysa  and Environeer Bert  If you fight them with low level pets, they will be scaled to match your highest level pet.
