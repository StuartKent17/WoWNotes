For the moment, we've only got two Tigole interviews on video as far as I know, we'll probably get more during the day and tomorrow. Let me know if I missed some of them

All the interviews are pretty much the same and most of the changes are already listed here and here. And if you didn't have an internet connection in the last month, the Blizzcon changes mega-list is still here. 

Haircuts and new dances
Yeah, actually I love the new dances and new haircuts as a feature. The new hairs because the facial hair on my dwarves just kept hiding my breastplate for the last two years, the new dances because I can't beat http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/stepmania.jpg this stupid I am Murloc song.

Anyway, a few things interesting here, dances will be taught at a dance studio and we will probably get more customizations than hair, according to the Curse interview with Tigole it will include facial hair, earrings, and tatoos. 

The idea is that hair is something that makes sense to be changeable in the game and the cosmetic alteration can make a very positive impact for some players so we want to make this available to everybody. By making the hair styles change, it does vary by race what this does to the character, but we also have no plans at this time to exclude people from using a cosmetic feature like this. We are also looking into extending this to cover facial hair features as well, but this has not been finalized at this time. 

We are also providing players the opportunity to learn new/different dances with the dance studio. Even if your character is scowling, this is another cosmetic change that can give your character a real positive attitude and people have shown great enthusiasm for.
