Professor Putricide (Heroic) World First Kill by Paragon<br>
Paragon (http://www.paragon-wow.com/) just defeated Professor Putricide in heroic mode and gets another world first kill in Icecrown Citadel. They killed all the end-wing bosses and the lich king is next on the list (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/lich_king_next.jpg). Congratulations to them.<br>

However, killing the Lich King in heroic mode might be harder than it looks. According to the russian guild &#x42D;&#x43A;&#x437;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x441;&#x443;&#x441; (http://exorsus.ru/) (EU-&#x420;&#x435;&#x432;&#x443;&#x449;&#x438;&#x439; &#x444;&#x44C;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x434;) the Lich King heroic mode has been buffed in 10-man instances and his health was buffed from 22.5M to 29.5M, making the fight look a lot harder now. It wouldn&apos;t be surprising if the buff also affected the 25-man version of the encounter. <br>
