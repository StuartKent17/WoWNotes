When a human is found unconscious on the shores of Kalimdor, with no memory of who he is or how he arrived there, how will he survive? Enslaved by an Orc Shaman, he must fight for survival against members of both the Alliance and the Horde. Will he strike the uneasy balance with the other races he'll need to find the secrets of his past?


The main page  is rather empty, but there are a few artworks here. The one on the left is from Samwise Didier ... If you don't know who he is, well, shame on you. Hopefully you can check his page on WoWWiki 

There is also a small Concept Art  link at the bottom, which is more interesting. And we could probably make pretty wallpapers from them !
