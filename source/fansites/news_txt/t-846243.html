Patch 4.0.6 on live realms this week<br>
Patch 4.0.6 will be deployed on live realms this week and it&apos;s time for a recap of the changes with a couple of highlights. You can find the retail patch notes below, they were massively updated compared to the PTR notes (more categories, bug fixes, etc ...) and I strongly suggest that you read them, even if you checked the PTR notes before. <br>

Archaeology Artifacts Price Changes<br>
Patch 4.0.6 changes the price of all the Archaeology junk items and makes the profession slightly more profitable. You won&apos;t make thousand of golds every hour but at least it won&apos;t feel like you&apos;re completely wasting your time!<br>
<br>
Also, Survey (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/80451/) has a 3 sec cooldown now, down from 5 sec. <br>

Instead of a 50/100% chance to make the next Blood Boil (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48721/blood-boil/) free when Plague Strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/45462/plague-strike/) is used on a target with Blood Plague (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/59879/blood-plague/), the talent now gives a 5/10% chance to provide a free Blood Boil when the death knight lands any melee attack on a Blood Plagued target.<br>
If Death Strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/49998/death-strike/) is used while a Blood Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77513/blood-shield/) is already active, the new absorb will stack with the old one instead of replacing it.<br>

Death&#x2019;s Advance (new talent): While both Unholy Runes are depleted, movement-impairing effects cannot reduce the death knight below 75/100% of normal movement speed.<br>
Desecration (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/55667/desecration/) is now also triggered by Necrotic Strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73975/necrotic-strike/).<br>
The ratio of runic power return from Magic Suppression (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/49611/magic-suppression/) has been reduced by roughly one third.<br>
Rage of Rivendare (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/50121/rage-of-rivendare/) now increases strike damage by 12/24/36%, down from 15/30/45%.<br>
Runic Corruption (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/51462/runic-corruption/) procs while the aura is already active now add 3 seconds to the existing aura duration, instead of simply refreshing/overwriting the existing aura.<br>

Sudden Doom (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/49530/sudden-doom/) is now triggered only from main-hand auto attacks, and is normalized according to weapon speed rather than having a fixed percentage chance.<br>

Virulence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/49568/virulence/) has been redesigned. It now grants 10/20/30% additional disease damage.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Glyph of Dark Succor (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96284/glyph-of-dark-succor/) (new glyph) raises the minimum healing done by Death Strike from 7% to 15% of maximum health, but only while in Unholy (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48265/unholy-presence/) or Frost Presence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48266/frost-presence/).<br>
Glyph of Death&#x2019;s Embrace (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/57215/glyph-of-deaths-embrace/) no longer refunds Runic Power when self-healing via Lichborne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/49039/lichborne/).<br>

Lay on Hands (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/633/lay-on-hands/) now causes Forbearance on the target. It used to only cause it when cast on the paladin. This was an old design from when Divine Protection (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/498/divine-protection/) caused Forbearance and the paladin didn&#x2019;t want to prevent a tank from using their defensive cooldown. <br>
Lay on Hands (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/633/lay-on-hands/) cannot be a critical effect and will not be affected by most abilities which modify healing (such as Beacon of Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53652/beacon-of-light/)). In addition, Lay on Hands is no longer on the global cooldown.<br>
Since only Divine Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/642/divine-shield/), Lay on Hands (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/633/lay-on-hands/) and Hand of Protection (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/1022/hand-of-protection/) cause Forbearance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/25771/forbearance/), the tooltips have been adjusted to better explain the mechanic.<br>

Hand of Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/76672/hand-of-light/) (Mastery): A percentage of the damage done by Templar&#x2019;s Verdict (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/85256/templars-verdict/), Crusader Strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/35395/crusader-strike/), and Divine Storm (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53385/divine-storm/) is done as additional Holy damage. This Mastery now grants a 2.1% increase to Holy damage per mastery, down from 2.5%.<br>
Repentance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/20066/repentance/) is no longer broken from damage done by Censure (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31803/censure/) (Seal of Truth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31801/seal-of-truth/)).<br>
The Rebuke (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96231/rebuke/) talent has been replaced with a new passive talent, Sacred Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/85285/sacred-shield/). Paladins who had Rebuke before will automatically have Sacred Shield. Sacred When reduced below 30% health, paladins gain the Sacred Shield effect. The Sacred Shield absorbs X damage and increases healing received by 20%. Lasts 15 seconds. This effect cannot occur more than once every 30 seconds. Undispellable.<br>

Paladin Bug Fixes<br>
<br>
The Silence debuff from Avenger&apos;s Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31935/avengers-shield/) was using the Dazed visual effect, and its Daze debuff did not have a visible effect. This has been remedied.<br>
The damage bonus from Communion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31876/communion/) is no longer applied even when the paladin has no paladin auras active.<br>
