WotLK Beta Patch Notes Update<br>
The official beta patch notes (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8557297750&amp;sid=2003) have been updated, and Wryxian was nice enough to highlight the changes for us. Most of them were reported in our previous WotLK Build 8681 - Undocumented Changes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=11464.0) post but as usual, official confirmations are always nice. <br>

Hunters / Warlock Pet Management in WotLK<br>
There are 2 additional slots in the stable. Integrating hunter / warlock pet management into the new mount and companion UI has certainly come up already. Let&apos;s give the new UI a whirl and see if it works and then we can consider if it makes sense to integrate the stable or anything else into it.

Lake Wintergrasp<br>
There will be a lot of tuning and balancing of the zone done in the coming months. One thing we are looking to do though to help with population imbalances is impose certain benefits for the side with less players in the zone. For instance, since supplies will be necessary to unlock certain vehicles, the side with the population handicap may see a decrease in requirements. We may also offer increasingly more supply benefits for a faction if they are suffering from consecutive losses in Lake Wintergrasp. The goal is to even the playing field regardless of faction population balances across all realms.<br>
<br>
We plan to give Lake Wintergrasp a definitive play time where the event may last somewhere around 45 minutes. The event would not start again for a set amount of time after the battle is won. We will tune these times as testing further develops. The plan, additionally, is to provide certain incentives for visiting this zone between battles.

Pets should be able to hold aggro, especially tanking pets with the right spec. Class dps in general is something we are still evaluating, because honestly it&apos;s a lot of wasted work if we haven&apos;t finalized the abilities yet. Once we have a feel for how much dps a hunter can do, and how much threat you generate, we&apos;ll adjust pets accordingly.

In the next data push, you will find Omen of Clarity has been changed a bit. The 10 second cooldown has been removed, the procs per minute has been raised from 2 to 3.5, and melee abilities no longer trigger it. Spell interaction with Omen of Clarity remains relatively unchanged, with its hidden chance to trigger off spells reduced by half (and rolling the dice about 2x as often).<br>
<br>
What this means is that more auto-attacks landing on the target will increase the benefit from Omen of Clarity. Haste, increased hit chance, and expertise will all make Omen of Clarity better.<br>
<br>
We are aware of the concerns with reaching the hit rating cap, and will make sure Druids can pick up Rogue items to wear without exceeding that cap. This means Rogues will likely socket for hit, while Druids socket for Strength or Agility.<br>
<br>
Before LK goes live, we will do extensive testing on how much damage classes do, and will increase or decrease their power as appropriate to meet our targets. Cat raid DPS suffered relative to other melee in BC for lack of an Combat Potency equivalent talent (OOC should now be roughly equal), for lack of a scaling finishing move (Savage Roar answers that), for lack of benefitting from Windfury Totem, and for lack of weapon procs (+35 agility != Mongoose). All of those lacks have been addressed. In addition, a change has been made to make the agility rebalance less severe (as I posted in another thread).<br>
<br>
In PvP, we are adding many tools to the Feral Druid arsenal, including the redesigned Maim, Infected Wounds, King of the Jungle, and Berserk. We have also made some improvements to the &quot;range bug&quot;. Attacks that require you to be behind a target will no longer be able to be parried, nor able to be dodged by a player. Our movement engine will now smoothly interpolate positions of moving units, preventing the &quot;Out of range/You must be behind your target/Out of range/You must be behind your target/Out of range/You must be behind your target...&quot; sequence from occuring any more. In addition, being able to apply a snare makes the Feral Druid able to slow down their target and lessen the severity of the &quot;range bug&quot;. Yes, there are still issues with the model, especially when switching into and out of cat form, but many of the issues are being dealt with.

<br>
------------------------<br>
<br>
To help deal with this issue, in the next data push, Druids should find their melee critical strike chance is about 5% higher.<br>
<br>
The conversion of agility to critical strike chance remains the same 40:1 at level 70, but the base amount for 0 agility has been increased by 5%. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8429963449&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=2000#8))<br>

Clarification on Fair Gameplay in Arenas<br>
There have been a number of questions recently on what exactly falls into the category of Win Trading in Arena matches, and therefore what is and is not considered acceptable, so we would like to provide some clarification on what is considered fair gameplay in Arena matches.<br>
<br>
The act of Win Trading may be described as the carrying out of premeditated plans to rise in arena rating by means of determining the outcome of a match prior or during its taking place. Win trading goes against the spirit of World of Warcraft and devalues the enjoyment of the game for all players who earn their victories by competing in a fair environment.<br>
<br>
Win Trading includes players tampering with, or otherwise abusing the queue system as well as colluding to enter into an arena match with a specific opposing team. In the case of arena collusion, we consider any situation where the standard queue possibilities are bypassed through an abuse of mechanics to be a violation of policy. This includes, but is not limited to, the act of tampering with one&#x2019;s team roster with exploitive intentions as well as setting up a situation that bypasses the randomness of our queue system where a team has a specific and predetermined opponent and repeatedly faces that team. Queuing against a known and affiliated opponent gives a competitive advantage over players who are entering the queue at random. We have measures in place to take action against any account found to be using these practices to advance their characters.<br>
<br>
These described actions all fall in line with our fair use clause in the Terms of Use, which specifically states:<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, certain acts go beyond what is &quot;fair&quot; and are considered serious violations of these Terms of Use. Those acts include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:<br>
1. Using or exploiting errors in design, features which have not been documented, and/or &quot;program bugs&quot; to gain access that is otherwise not available, or to obtain a competitive advantage over other players;<br>
<br>
With that being said we are aware that players will often face the same team multiple times in succession due to a lack of similarly rated teams in the queue. Naturally this is not in violation, nor should players worry if ever they happen upon a situation such as this, but we will invoke action against any team when the team in question creates an agreement to exchange matches or tamper with the queuing system. Regardless of the content of these games, this presents a conflict of interest that we wish to deter in order to keep our arena system competitive.<br>
<br>
In our continued efforts to support fair gameplay we have taken steps to ensure fair and enjoyable competition in the Arena by taking action on players who are found to be involved in Win Trading. Actions for violations may include not only penalties to the account but also confiscation of any gear that has been won if deemed necessary. Our Support staff will continue to enforce fair gameplay in Arena matches and all aspects of the game and will continue to address any new concerns to ensure that the playing field is kept fair.<br>
