Anduin's Questline - Where's the Horde part?
Having been keeping tabs on this over the weekend I realise my original post really missed the mark. In my haste to post the details we received about the intent of the Anduin cinematic I didn't really do a very good job of addressing the points other than AP that had come up in similar discussions on the internet. It wasn't my intent to come across as disregarding, mocking, sarcastic or anything of the sort with my original post. I'm sorry if it came across that way.

We definitely hear that Horde players would like to see more story development for their faction following the events of 7.0, and likewise we understand that players of both factions are hungry for more story development in general. Both of those points were also included in the feedback we collated and forwarded regarding this topic, and will continue to be included going forward. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
