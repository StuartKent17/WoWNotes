Warcraft Movie Update<br>
The Hollywood Reporter talked (http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywood-gorilla-warfare-s-universal-823715) about Legendary and Universal today, claiming that sources say Warcraft is seen as &quot;problem movies&quot; by Universal. Duncan Jones isn&apos;t worried though! <br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Raids<br>
real talk: LFD and LFR, ultimately, at the end of the day, all is said and done, bad for a game?<br>
I still don&apos;t know. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642850460651524096))<br>
If you put a gun to my head I&apos;d say LFG with harder dungeons and no LFR. But it&apos;s a crap shoot. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642850635205865472))<br>
Easyish Naxx and LK dungeons set expectations that were hard to ever undo. Maybe LFG was just a symptom at that point. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642850895969976321))<br>
is the irrevocability of a feature a big part of the design decision or is it more if a hindsight is 20/20 thing?<br>
For a live game (like LoL/WoW) you always have to think about the precedents you set. It&apos;s like being a SCOTUS judge. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642898697861206016))<br>
I wasn&apos;t paying attention during the Cata difficulty outrage--would it have been possible to soldier through?<br>
Yes. Better would have been to provide an alternative for those who didn&apos;t enjoy wiping. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/643134188577755136))<br>
<br>
Why do you think many players are longing for TBC days. Raiding was impossible back then..<br>
I wouldn&apos;t call it nostalgia per se, but we remember the feeling we had when everything felt so new and we miss that feeling. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/643133300358410240))<br>
<br>
Game Design<br>
Thoughts on allowing (or not) respec in single player RPGs? Respec kinda waters down character building... (1/2)<br>
It depends if you want starting a new character to be a good or bad thing. No respec can encourage that. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642850183290552320))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
greg i really just want you to stop answering questions about world of warcraft and focus on your new better life, forever<br>
I try to answer questions that are applicable to game development as a whole. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642898996378275841))<br>
