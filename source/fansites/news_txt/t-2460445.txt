Dungeons and Raids

Temple of Sethraliss

Adderis no longer changes facing while casting Cyclone Strike.

Tol Dagor

Tomb of Sargeras

The Gates of Hell Wing no longer requires a minimum number of players on Raid Finder difficulty.

Uldir

G'Huun

Malignant Growth can no longer be spell reflected.
G'huun's health reduced by 5% on all difficulties.




Items

Mistletoe now requires the Feast of Winter Veil and is cleared from players’ bags after the holiday ends.

Developers’ note: We like fun holiday buffs adding flavor to the game and we don’t want to prevent them from being used in raids and dungeons. We also don’t like unusable items taking up inventory space the rest of the year. We expect to make future holiday buff items follow the same pattern.



Player versus Player

Fixed an issue that allowed players to drop the Temple of Kotmogu orbs by using specific mounts.
Resolved an issue that caused Call to Arms to not count battleground victories at level 120.
Secret Supply Chests are now lootable once per factional assault.
