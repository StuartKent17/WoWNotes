<br>
There is a new event, the Brewfest Chowdown, which is an eating contest. <br>
<br>
The event begins once 4 people click the stand.<br>
You have 3 buttons - one to eat, one to drink, and one to call for more food.<br>
<br>
Eating fills your bar<br>
Drinking reduces the bar.<br>
You have to call for more food after eating 3x.<br>
<br>
The goal is to be the first to finish 10 plates while trying not to let the bar get to 100 as it makes you choke for a few seconds<br>
<br>
A variety of events (other than a Dark Iron attack) can happen such as alementals running rampant or Hozen attacks.<br>
Down With The Dark Iron (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/1186-down-with-the-dark-iron) has been removed from the Brewmaster (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/1683-brewmaster) achievement.<br>
The loot from Coren Direbrew (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/23872-coren-direbrew) is item level 395 for max level characters.<br>
