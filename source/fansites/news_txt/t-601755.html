<br>
I know this post is a few days old, but I guess it will make some people happy to know that Blizzard loves them. But sometimes, love is not enough, and it seems that some realms like Elune (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1134163498&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=1) are unplayable since the upgrade. As you can see in the post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1134163498&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=1), Blizzard is trying to find the problem but according to the last reply they didn&apos;t identify anything yet.<br>

Haste rating changes in 2.2<br>
