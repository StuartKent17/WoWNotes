The Darkmoon Faire is now active on all servers and will end on December 15th. New Darkmoon cards are available in Wrath of the Lich King and I&apos;m pretty sure I never took the time to news them. <br>
<br>
Drop Location<br>
None! As of today Darkmoon Cards can only be created through inscription (Darkmoon Card of the North (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=59504)), this recipe will give you a random Darkmoon Card for a level 80 Deck. (Similar recipes are available for LVL 70 Cards (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=59503) and LVL 60 Cards (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=59502))<br>
<br>
I hope you saved some Eternal Life (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=35625), they probably won&apos;t be cheap in the next few days. <br>

Dual Talent Spec and Glyphs<br>
Well we agree that swapping talent specs isn&apos;t quite enough. No use having a whole load of glyphs for your tanking spec that are almost useless when you&apos;re dealing damage, for example. We&apos;d also like to swap over action bars too -- it&apos;d be a pain if you&apos;re trying to Mind Flay and you end up trying to Flash Heal!<br>
<br>
So yes we have taken these kind of considerations into account and we&apos;d like the feature to do more than &quot;just&quot; swap talent specs.<br>
<br>
Because it is a bit more featured than originally mentioned, we&apos;ll be needing to do a bit more work on it before we can share it with you. So we&apos;re hoping to bring this feature to you in our next major content patch, but only if we&apos;re happy enough with it to make it live. <br>
