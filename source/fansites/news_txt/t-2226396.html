Addon - Immersion<br>
Immersion (https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/257550-immersion) is an addon that provides a more immersive quest text frame. It uses the talking heads system to display quest text, but still allows you to skip things when you are in a hurry.<br>

Blizzard and Professionalism<br>
The WoW forums have always been a place of back and forths between CMs, Devs, and Players, and I&apos;ve watched the back and forths between Lore, Kalgan, Tigole, Bashiok, Eyonix, Tseric, etc and our players for years, and I just want to be clear that we don&apos;t consider this anything new. I think it&apos;s what makes our forums a fun place while discussing serious issues. I&apos;m appreciative of the overall conversation, though, and I&apos;ve read through all of it, both on here and /r/wow, throughout the day.<br>
<br>
My post in question was directed at a snarky player on the &quot;there&apos;s no content&quot; train who hadn&apos;t touched a good amount of Legion&apos;s content, including LFR, minus a wing of Nighthold. My comment to the player was only pointing out facts, albeit in a snarky way not unknown to the forums.<br>
<br>
I think folks have gotten confused by the message on both sides. If you tell me, &quot;There&apos;s nothing to do in Legion!&quot; I&apos;ll tell you that&apos;s a lie, flat out. If you tell me, &quot;There&apos;s nothing for *me* to do in Legion!&quot; or &quot;Nothing in this patch makes me want to play!&quot; that&apos;s a topic I think we can discuss. Now, the post in question was the former, and, as said, in an attempt to be catty towards me, that comment was made. It&apos;s easy to delete a comment and move on, but it takes a lot more willpower to engage in a conversation, call out false statements (even if done half-assedly in a joking manner), and try to engage on the real issue.<br>
<br>
Our team is not part of Customer Service, and we don&apos;t necessarily adhere to the same levels of &apos;professionalism&apos; that they may in their day-to-day, and, even when we do, it&apos;s very much relaxed as it is in most of the industry. Not trying to put down our Customer Service compatriots in any way, they do a stellar job, I just think its important to note that our teams goals are different. My goal here is first and foremost engagement and community-building, and I&apos;m given free rein to do that as I see fit (albeit to my own pleasure and detriment). I appreciate everyone here who talks about their time in CS roles, I&apos;ve had some experience in them myself, and I understand the difference of the role vs the audience in both capacities.<br>
<br>
An interesting note, but I don&apos;t see our team as &apos;professional&apos;, in the sense that we uphold ourselves to some golden, glorious, corporate standard. I consider us &apos;experts&apos; in our crafts, but nothing more than players who sit at the developer&apos;s table who have been given blue text and sometime receive emails with information that you may not see.<br>
<br>
So GD&apos;s righteous indignation is chasing off another Blizzard employee? The only one that still posts here?<br>
No one&apos;s chasing me off, don&apos;t worry.<br>
<br>
I think we can all stand to take and throw a few punches, and we&apos;ll all get along better if we have a bit of fun. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1062254-blizzard-and-professionalism/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20754917221?page=9#172))<br>

Why does SW have two Varian statues, but Orgm doesnt have even 1 for Cairne/Vol&apos;jin/Doomhammer? Muffinus<br>
Horde not so big into statues. Waste of good rocks that could be flung at gnomes. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/866481212004552705))<br>
