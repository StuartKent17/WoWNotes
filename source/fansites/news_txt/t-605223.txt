Paid Transfer and Name Change Cooldown
The cooldown to transfer your character or change your name is now 1 month only.
We have made changes to the Paid Character Transfer and Paid Name Change cooldown times, and have lowered them from three months, to one month. The cooldown refers to the length of time between when a character first uses one of these services and the next time it can be used. These two services do not share a cooldown.

When the paid transfers originally opened back in June of 2006, they included a six month cooldown. This was rather high as we had no statistics or data that would show us what effect the transfers would have on the game as a whole. It was rather conservative for a new feature. After analyzing any possible security risks, impact on the economy, and effect on in-game communities, the cooldown was reduced to three months in October of 2006.

Since that time we have released eight major content patches and the Burning Crusade expansion, and as the game has evolved we have continued monitoring the impact these services have, who’s using them, and purpose for their use. We’re now confident that a cooldown reduction to one month will not increase an already minor impact these services have.


Warlocks - Lifetap changes in 2.4
The new version of Lifetap was bugged badly when it's been introduced on PTRs, blizzard employees made a few posts to explain how the skill is supposed to work in 2.4.
Yes there is a bug with lifetap only returning mana based on your current mana instead of your maximum mana. This is being worked on. [b] Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4821924309&postId=47753359571&sid=1#3

Improved Life Tap will work the same as it always has. You get 20% more mana with the talent than you get without it. So, with 0 points in the talent, you get 15% of your max mana. With one point, you get 16.5%. With 2 points, you get 18%.

The amount of health lost when tapping does not change. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4913821490&postId=49134094193&sid=1#7
