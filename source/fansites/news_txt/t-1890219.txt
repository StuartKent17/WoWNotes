Submit Questions for the Developers
We have our first interview in a long time coming up at Blizzcon and as always, we want to let the community ask questions! This time our interview will be covering the design of Legion.

If you have any questions you think we should ask, be sure to add them to the comments of the linked post  for consideration. We will pick the best questions and add them to our list! 


Don't post any questions in the comments of this news post. Use the linked topic  instead.
These should be questions about Legion, not Warlords of Draenor.
No class specific questions please. This includes things like balance between the different healing/tank/DPS classes and specs.
Keep questions reasonably short. 




  


Warcraft Trailer Screenshots
Some screenshots from the Warcraft trailer were posted on Reddit  this weekend. Obviously this was not intended for release and may not represent the final movie.

Day of the Dead
Day of the Dead  was updated last year. There are several wrestling inspired costumes you can purchase for <span class="money-gold" alt="g">100</span> from Chapman  Once in the costume, you can do battle with other costumed players. You can use the costumes even after the holiday is over !

There seems to be a bug with the achievements this year, as you can't kill other players with the costume on, only bring them to 1 health. You need to be dueling for them to die. 


  

If you haven't already done the other part of the holiday, be sure to check out the guide on Icy Veins

How do you feel about Wildstar's area-effect visuals and would you change them? Muffinus 
I think Wildstar really made that their thing, so it works for them. I was worried we were going to overdo it for WoW. 
I agree with this statement. Muffinus 

Why is "gamey" considered a bad thing? — Games need rules, but when the rules intrude too much it can be disruptive… 
Real answer: because immersion is often at odds with clarity. Sometimes, there is a more immersive way to get that gameplay. Muffinus 

Commercial gyms are like Casual guilds, with casual members. Minimum effort yet members want maximum attention / perks. 
Gyms want to be a product that everyone buys but very few people use:  holinka 
ultimately you should be happy about those casuals. They keep prices down. holinka 
over the members who pour their sweat and hard work day in day out at the gym?
make a gym like that! Maybe you can change the world! This is all addressed in the linked podcast btw holinka 
also it is probably not $10-20 more a month. More like "double or triple what I pay now." holinka 
I'm also not saying it's a good thing. Just the way gyms are structured now. Definitely room for high price hardcore gyms. holinka 
why should that even be a means to an end though. I'm not even thinking about a REALLY hardcore gym. Just some place that has high
I guess the bottom line is most gyms are setup to sell memberships not to have people work out in them. Seems backwards right? holinka 
Just describing why not defending it. But that person who gets on the elliptical for 10 then leaves is more cost effective. holinka 
pays as much as you but is only there for 10 minutes. Most cost effective person? The one that never shows up at all. Free money holinka 
real life is very sad holinka 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
what's your take on the popularity of classic WoW servers? Is it time?
I've never played on one. I understand the appeal but not sure if it's a satisfying meal or just a light snack. OccupyGStreet
