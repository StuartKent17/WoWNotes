chaud2018-06-12, 08:43 PMBlood Trolls - Not an Allied Race
Just to clear the confusion, there was a small segment in yesterday's E3 interview with IGN in which we weren't entirely clear - but we want to clarify that Blood Trolls are not currently planned as an Allied Race. 

It can be easy to mix up words in interviews when you're covering a range of story points such as that of the Blood Trolls and their interactions with the Zandalari - but we just wanted to be sure we could get a note out on this before we get more Allied Race rumors flying around. 

Thanks for the discussion here!
