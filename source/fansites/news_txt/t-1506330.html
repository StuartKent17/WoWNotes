Warlords of Draenor - Draenei Guard Armor Set<br>
It seems that players may not be able to get this set, as it appears to be intended for NPCs.<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
Racials<br>
Noticing undead racials only ones useless to healers, any plans to change that? Touch of grave restore mana on heal cast etc?<br>
Yeah, Undead for Healers is on our list to look at. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452035468159250433))<br>
<br>
do races still have bonuses to professions or has that been removed?<br>
They still have them. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452133965218848768))<br>
<br>
What&apos;s the logic behind making Arcane Torrent give pally&apos;s 1 HP, but priests &amp; monks 3% mana?<br>
It&apos;s 1 Chi for Monks, and Priests have no secondary resource. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452180114642452481))<br>
<br>
Classes<br>
with all this changes its safe to say that encounters will be tunned for low burst/low inevitable damage?<br>
LowER damage, yes. We&apos;ll tune around healers&apos; potential. There&apos;s still room for scary burst moments, with time to recover after. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452115423178153984))<br>
<br>
Sorry if you answered, but what is the reason for less crit on int users, but more on agi?<br>
Fits their theme better, and is consistent with how they have been for 9+ years. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452147125434851328))<br>
<br>
Bigger change: Active mitigation for tanks in Cata/MoP, or coming healer changes in WoD?<br>
Active Mitigation for tanks. That fundamentally changed how you tank; healing changes are more about pace. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452179800539418624))<br>
<br>
small question , if I may - on Garrosh kills, often tank contributes a /huge/ amnt of dmg, certainly in phase one.. how (1/2)<br>
Tank damage will still be significant, as described in the paragraph above Resolve. We&apos;re increasing their base damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452186308799000577))<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Y))<br>
Will repeated Rune Taps and Strike increase the size of the Rune Shield like Blood Shield currently?<br>
Yes, successive Rune Strikes and Rune Taps add to the size of a Rune Shield. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452135816341385216))<br>
<br>
More! Frost DK, Perks improve Razorice/Cinderglacier, 2h currently uses neither (favoring Fallen Crusader). Changing that?<br>
Yeah, we&apos;re going to try mixing up which runeforges Frost uses. Realize that that&apos;s a big change, and what you see isn&apos;t enough. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452148212552306688))<br>
Interesting. Going to be a playstyle thing, or more &quot;x rune required for x type of fight&quot;?<br>
Current plan is Cinderglacier for 2H, Cinderglacier+Razorice for DW. Definitely not set in stone. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452148689352417280))<br>
<br>
Blood DK 3 shields? Blood Shield, Rune Shield &amp; Rune Tap shield?<br>
Rune Shield is one shield shared by Rune Tap (huge) and Rune Strike (tiny). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452021320008470528))<br>
Rune Strike just provides a more frequent, steady stream of little shields. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452021427219091456))<br>
I personally was a huge fan of the reactive active mitigation that DKs had<br>
It&apos;s still there. It&apos;s done transparently through Resolve, instead of being an opaque mechanic specific to DStrike (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452136105291173889))<br>

Will ravage (feral) still need facing requirement? Nice change for ambush, backstab, and shred BTW.<br>
I believe it is the same for ravage. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/452144744294928384))<br>
Yes, same for Ravage. I&apos;ll get that added to the notes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452144841170751488))<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M))<br>
Any chance of survival becoming a multi-dot spec?<br>
You can apply Serpent Sting on multiple mobs, so it is in a way. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452022001037635585))<br>
<br>
Disarm Trap. Just the spell is being removed? Or the entire ability to disarm traps (e.g., by right-clicking on them)?<br>
Disarm Trap completely removed. Detect Trap is staying for now. Reasoning is because of the PvP disarmament. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452178748058525696))<br>
<br>
skimmed hunter sections of notes, can&apos;t help but feel gutted. Lots of utility gone; just another dps in the crowd.<br>
You are the only ranged DPS class who can do everything on the move, for starters. What are the main abilities you&apos;ll miss? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/451936974140493825))<br>
Scatter S &amp; Distracting S are big, Widow Venom less so. Silence S gone include Counter S? HMark nice flavor but not critical.<br>
What is the everyday use of Distracting Shot that you&apos;re going to miss most? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452107024076009472))<br>
<br>
Distracting shot is the only thing I&apos;ll miss... so nice on Heroic LK 25 solo to get the adds on me so I won&apos;t be dropped off <br>
That&apos;s something we can (and will) fix on the encounter logic side. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452106214453682177))<br>
<br>
Scatter S &amp; Distracting S are big, Widow Venom less so. Silence S gone include Counter S? HMark nice flavor but not critical.<br>
No, you keep Counter Shot. Scatter/Silence were removed as part of overall CC disarmament. Nearly everyone lost something. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452106839006535683))<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g))<br>
Will the new Mirror Images mimic mage&apos;s spell casting or just cast filter spells? If mimic, big DPS CD; if not, very weak.<br>
It&apos;s a big DPS CD. They cast spec-appropriate spells, and hit hard. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452029335000453120))<br>
So they have a set rotation but won&apos;t mimic your own spell casting?<br>
Correct. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452030044378902528))<br>
<br>
Flameglow also feels like something we&apos;d never use, not sure if you have any plans to modify it, or just leave it as is.<br>
Flameglow shines in the case where you&apos;re taking frequent little hits of damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452212087779885056))<br>
<br>
PoM... what will we use it with? AB? Maybe we could make it give us some kind of buff, or do something different?<br>
Mostly Arcane Blast. Occasionally a couple other things. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452211986076430336))<br>
You didn&apos;t consider changing it, or just cutting it? High-haste AB... it&apos;ll be useless, not sure why we&apos;re keeping it.<br>
It&apos;s definitely not useless... Faster, and usable while moving. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452214371968487424))<br>
<br>
Sad that evo is arcane-only now. I liked the glyph as fire.<br>
Glyph boils down to a cooldown-heal, which is cool (and I liked too). Doesn&apos;t necessarily need to be tied to evoc. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/451911723327299585))<br>
How do fire/frost regen mana?<br>
Do you find yourself low on mana at any point nowadays? Making mana more interesting would be great, big change tho (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/452132573712355329))<br>
I like the evo-heal as a PvP mage, too. But hey I&apos;ll get over it <br>
We turned the Glyph of Evocation heal into Glyph of Ice Block, which attaches that same heal to Ice Block. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452134120533942272))<br>
Is that Ice Block heal an HOT (cancel Ice Block early, no full heal), or instant?<br>
Same HoT as Glyph of Evo had. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452142047533621248))<br>
any way to counter that? At least on live, we can kick/cc the evo. Maybe allow MD to remove block and heal?<br>
Mass Dispel does break Ice Block in 6.0. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452186836740227072))<br>
<br>
Do Frost bomb pulses triggered by Ice Lance still snare targets?<br>
No. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452180741858656256))<br>
<br>
really hoping for some clarification on what brain freeze is getting turned into<br>
Still going to make it treat the target as frozen, and increase damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452183997053808640))<br>
<br>
Incanter&apos;s Flow is: 5-10-15-20-25-20-15-10-5 and back up, or does it go down to 0?<br>
5-10-15-20-25-25-20-15-10-5-repeat. Yes, that may be OP compared to Rune at current tuning. Tuning process comes later. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452184540966973440))<br>
<br>
Is Water Jets inteded usage for PvE when the nova can&apos;t trigger FoF on Bosses?<br>
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452146885768146944))<br>
<br>
brain freeze going to be hitting harder relevant to other mage spells to make up for added cast time?<br>
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452152636163117056))<br>
<br>
Very happy to see deepfreeze gone from fire, but I won&apos;t be able to have knockback blastwave+ living bomb? :/<br>
Correct. One or the other. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452030828856348674))<br>
Will there be a knockback version of blastwave? Liked it much better than the daze effect one.<br>
Supernova does a knock up, but no knockback. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452031386874937344))<br>
<br>
I never liked running and casting, but yeah it&apos;s only the filler. What about scorch? Won&apos;t be useable on the move right?<br>
Scorch will. Mages are fairly light on ability to cast while moving (well, Fire/Arcane anyway). Scorch&apos;s damage is low. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452037580217778176))<br>
<br>
Are Dragon&apos;s Breath/Cone of Cold going to be AoE DPS increases in Warlords? Or just utility spells?<br>
Yes, significant DPS value. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452155638781456384))<br>

Question about Mistweaver monks: How high is the DPS going to be in another stance? Can I fulfill DD role in raid permanently?<br>
Exact numbers TBD, but no - someone equal to a pure DPS who could stance swap to be a full healer would be too good. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452116529677488128))<br>
<br>
If you keep that up people can&apos;t do anything when taking damage and can do it all when taking little. No counterplay.<br>
We did add countering gameplay to Fists of Fury. If you break the stun, it will not restun you. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452175773034508288))<br>
<br>
Brewmaster monks have found a niche in raiding as the &quot;high dps tanks&quot;. Will we still bring that utility in WoD?<br>
They had that niche briefly, especially around 5.2, but that hasn&apos;t really been the case since then. All tank dmg will be equal. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452194001362227200))<br>

Prot paladin losing Aven Wrath - does this also mean no more wings? As its symbolic of the paladin in my view<br>
We hear ya on the feedback about the Wings visual. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452031942750253056))<br>
<br>
Please don&apos;t forget the rets, taking 30% of your damage and GoAKis going to ruining our dps that is not already so good<br>
Rest easy, we haven&apos;t done a damage tuning pass yet. Those are design changes, not balance changes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452153127131557888))<br>
<br>
Empowered Seals paladin talent. Seal juggling viable again? And can we get more than one buff from this active at same time?<br>
Yes. That is explicitly a talent to opt into seal twisting. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452161125535076352))<br>
I thought it was still just called stance dancing<br>
&quot;Dancing&quot; refers to swapping states to use an ability you can only use in that state. &quot;Twisting&quot; refers to mixing states... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452173153209290752))<br>
... back and forth, frequently, in order to gain the benefit of both. #gaminglingo (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452173272784715776))<br>
<br>
Crit/multistrike still useless for Prot Paladins in terms of mitigation? and any changes to Holy Wrath?<br>
No, not useless. Very useful. Stay tuned for next patch notes update. Still considering Holy Wrath changes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452028773630611456))<br>
will this include ret stuff?!? Seems very light. Changes to talents? Less cd dependent? Glyphs? Divine storm in ST?<br>
Ret&apos;s in a fairly good place right now, design-wise. We think simple number tuning can solve their problems (hasn&apos;t happened yet) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452030586874363904))<br>
Removing Inquisition negates a lot of our Holy Damage unless compensated elsewhere. Tuning needs to be done soon.<br>
Relax. We will do a damage tuning pass. The sky is not falling. Removing Inquisition is done as a design change, not balance change (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452033022653513728))<br>
<br>
Would I be right in assuming that seraphim is designed to be a &quot;mini burst&quot; cd? Playing into the CD orientated ret gameplay?...<br>
Yes. It&apos;s a small frequent CD, that also makes your other CDs more frequent. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452035327859761153))<br>
other CDs more frequent? How so? Didn&apos;t read that anywhere<br>
With Seraphim, you should typically hit your other cooldowns while Seraphim is active (and so you have more Readiness). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452035978069155840))<br>
readiness reduces my cooldown on my major burst CDs???<br>
That&apos;s... exactly what Readiness does, yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452036512889073664))<br>
oh wow! Ok, well if it&apos;s going to be temp, how will that effect calculations of CD timers? Seems complicated<br>
While Seraphim is up, your CDs are shorter; ideal to hit them then. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452036981279555584))<br>
when seraphim goes off, the CD goes back up again? What happens if the CD was only 10 secs away with sera, then falls?<br>
At the time that you use a CD, its remaining cooldown is locked it; it doesn&apos;t change further. It&apos;s pretty intuitive. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452037818081370112))<br>
<br>
A Paladin without Holy Light is no longer a Warcraft Paladin. Uther did not heal people with &quot;Word Of Glory&quot;.<br>
We removed the &quot;cheap, weak heal&quot; -- names will be reassigned to keep the most iconic ones. I agree with you. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452104939007774721))<br>

Clarity of power will make both Solace and insanity and Divine insight completely useless for singlet target fight. Thoughts?<br>
It definitely will not affect Solace and Insanity. Divine Insight is being changed to proc from something else instead. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452024424565194752))<br>
Sorry, meant for From Darkness, comes light instead of Solace and Insanity. Is this one also getting changed?<br>
Yes. Don&apos;t recall the exact change. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452024903730876416))<br>
<br>
is it worth to use holy word:sanctuary in wod? It is almost useless without 4 piece bonus.<br>
Yes. It was massively buffed. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452025896983998464))<br>
<br>
SW: D removed from disc/holy? Skill-cap of priests reduced by a LARGE amount. This makes no sense<br>
There&apos;s a glyph to get back the gameplay you&apos;re talking about for Holy/Disc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452027069543628800))<br>
<br>
with aoe capping for lvl 90 priest talents, what they place in rotation? It will cost much, with not so big heals.<br>
They&apos;re still high priority, rotationally. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452030131674939392))<br>
<br>
And is that new mastery for Shadow supposed to be the big &apos;wow, damage!&apos; factor from losing all this utility? No mana hymn?<br>
We cut a ton of abilities from all classes, not just Shadow. Shadow&apos;s new Mastery is immensely powerful in choosing ST vs AoE. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451895217763799040))<br>
Have to say, I was looking forward to a ST *talent*, but having to choose AE/ST in gearing DO NOT WANT<br>
Curious, why? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452019128476241920))<br>
Didn&apos;t see Mind Sear on that list. Still, would be better through a talent rather than gear. Gear locks you in. Talent doesnt<br>
Gear most certainly does *not* lock you in. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452033649303498752))<br>

Hello, why was Shadow Word: Death removed from healing priests? It&apos;s a skillful mechanic in PvP<br>
That mechanic is still there via Glyph of Holy Fire, which gives Holy Fire the self-damage skillshot for Holy/Disc in PvP. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452141613498650624))<br>
wow... That&apos;s not in the patch notes yet I guess (or I might be blind). Thanks.<br>
Nope, we don&apos;t have a full list of new/removed glyphs in the patch notes yet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452143727369138176))<br>

Is there a chance that Enhanced Premeditation will be scrapped? Being able to control Premeditation is fairly important...<br>
We realize that it has some downside to it, but believe that the power of Enhanced Premeditation, combined with CP being... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452038135635922945))<br>
...on the rogue, instead of target specific, make it a significant net gain. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452038267026685953))<br>
<br>
With backstab not getting changed will hemo be more like cata? Diff in mop hemo &amp; stab 64% cata 16%...<br>
Not sure what you&apos;re asking... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452144084715442177))<br>
when you are forced to use hemo the difference in mop from backstab is massive in cata is was a small loss.<br>
Somewhere in between. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452145141759754240))<br>
Could we at least get an explanation on why backstab is now the only positional move in the game? Pls don&apos;t say its the name<br>
Because it&apos;s a small DPS difference that you can opt into. Fits Subtlety&apos;s theme. Shouldn&apos;t be usable on something attacking you. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452146828436193280))<br>
Shred mangle had this same difference you could opt into and yet. I was really looking forward to sub not being held back..<br>
That wasn&apos;t something you could opt into or out of. Backstab is not something that will &apos;hold back&apos; Subtlety. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452150468366438400))<br>
So in PvP, is it now possible to be able to Backstab somebody and be dodged or parried?<br>
Not if you stay behind the target, as you have been. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452176435801628672))<br>

Ele takes huge hit to single target with no compensation?Also, no one will use EQ even with the buff.Maybe if it&apos;s instant cast.<br>
Don&apos;t look for &apos;compensation&apos; like that; we haven&apos;t done a damage tuning pass yet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452030999409348608))<br>
And I think you may have missed the Draenor Perk that affects Earthquake. It&apos;s gigantic. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452031081995190273))<br>
<br>
Another clarifying question: Shocking Lava, is that on casts or hits (ie: will LvB overloads add a charge)?<br>
Cast. Overloads don&apos;t generate additional charges. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452185416565669888))<br>
<br>
Mobile LB must stay for Ele. Can&apos;t use ES while moving since we need to build stacks. Unleash&apos;s damage is bad / being removed.<br>
Actually, you can use Earth Shock for movement; it&apos;s good for that, no loss of Fulmination DPS. And perhaps you misread... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452141889383178240))<br>
...the Unleash Elements changes? It&apos;s better than before, still very valuable while moving. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452141973499940864))<br>
<br>
Ascendance is too good to not use Spiritwalker&apos;s with, too. Options would be nice! Maybe revise the lvl45 tier?<br>
You only say that because you&apos;re used to Ascendance being the only time SwG has much value to you. You won&apos;t pair them in Warlords. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452143932248297472))<br>
<br>
any chance we could get a minor glyph that makes Lighting Bolt look like b4? When it was actually a bolt... Thx!<br>
Technically it was really more of a ball.... Always looking for cool cosmetic glyphs, though. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452115143489359872))<br>

Of all the &quot;button Bloat&quot; for locks why not get rid of unending breath?<br>
It&apos;s a possibility, but our concern was more with combat abilities. Is Unending Breath something you give a prominent keybind? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452130715816050688))<br>
<br>
Any reason of Soulshatter removal? Just ability bloat?<br>
Largely. It&apos;s mostly seen as a relic from days when DPS needed active threat management tools (Feint, Cower, etc.). (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452195013099667456))<br>
<br>
Worried Affliction rot will be simple: Keep dots/haunt up spam Mal grasp all fight?<br>
Then you&apos;d be missing out on timing Haunt well. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452147667565424640))<br>

Thanks for the answer! Also, could you confirm that current goal for Gladiator instance is making prot a viable DPS spec?<br>
Confirmed, but you will NOT be able to viably tank in Gladiator Stance. Really. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452030291754758144))<br>
<br>
removing berseker stance was something I never thought I was gonna see. We&apos;re the stances so hard to balance for WoD? pvp<br>
.It isn&apos;t a question of balance but rather finding an interesting niche for both DPS stances. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/452144604217737216))<br>
<br>
How will Resolve help warrior tanks with their limited self heals and absorbs?<br>
The same way Vengeance helps them now -- it lets Shield Barrier scale with incoming damage (Shield Block naturally does). (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452175733180227584))<br>
