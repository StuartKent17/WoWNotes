What&apos;s Changing (and Not!) in Season 2<br>
Hi all,<br>
<br>
We have a series of blogs accompanying the release of the upcoming Battle of Dazar&#x2019;alor raid, the new Mythic Keystone season, and the new PvP season, offering deep dives into each of those features. But in the meantime, the community clearly has a ton of questions (and some confusion) about exactly what is and isn&#x2019;t changing. Should you be spending or saving your bonus rolls? What should you expect from the weekly Mythic Keystone cache next week? What&#x2019;s up with the Azerite vendor?<br>
<br>
For those of you who played Legion, the process will largely be familiar, though in Battle for Azeroth we&#x2019;re trying to align the opening of a new raid tier with the start of new PvP and Mythic+ seasons, to avoid some of the awkward item-level leapfrogging that we saw during Legion (e.g. the Mythic Keystone cap repeatedly going up to 15 and then back down to 10). Here&#x2019;s a succinct summary of what is and isn&#x2019;t changing next week, when Battle of Dazar&#x2019;alor opens on Normal and Heroic difficulties, and PvP and M+ Season 2 begin:<br>
<br>
Overall<br>
<br>
The maximum possible item level will go up by 30, from 395 to 425.<br>
<br>
<br>
Warfronts<br>
<br>
Arathi/Stromgarde rewards will remain as they were previously.<br>
Darkshore rewards will go up by 15 item levels, so that the outdoor world boss and the once-per-cycle quest both award item-level 400 gear.<br>
The power of all enemies in the Darkshore Warfront will also go up by roughly 15%, and the item level required to queue for Darkshore will go up from 320 to 335.<br>
Special note: The two Darkshore changes will only take effect after the current Warfront cycle has ended. So if Alliance is attacking Darkshore in a given region when Season 2 begins, and has 3 days left in that attack cycle, that Darkshore will still give Season 1 rewards.<br>
<br>
This is being done to avoid any unfairness to people who had already completed the Warfront or done the world boss just prior to the season rollover.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Kul Tiras and Zandalar World Content<br>
<br>
Emissary weapon and armor rewards will scale up to 385 (based on a player&#x2019;s own item level), up from 370.<br>
The loot from Kul Tiras and Zandalar world bosses will remain item level 355, on par with Normal Uldir.<br>
The rewards for in-progress emissary quests may reroll or update when Season 2 begins, though the quests themselves won&#x2019;t reset or change.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeons<br>
<br>
The item level of rewards from max-level Normal, Heroic, and Mythic dungeons will go up by 30. Baseline rewards will be 340 from Normal, 355 from Heroic, and 370 from non-Keystone Mythic.<br>
Difficulty of Heroic and Mythic dungeons will also go up by roughly 30%; Normal dungeons are unchanged.<br>
Mythic Keystones will go down by an additional 3 levels when the season transition occurs, to account for this difficulty increase. So if you do an 11 this coming week, instead of getting a Level 10 keystone when Season 2 starts, expect a 7.<br>
Mythic+ rewards will also go up by 30 item levels; however, during the first week of Season 2, rewards from end-of-run chests will be capped at Mythic 6 quality (item level 385), and the chest you open next week will contain Season 1 rewards if you do a Mythic+ run this week. (So, for example, if you do a Mythic 10 during the final week of Season 1, you&#x2019;ll get a Season 1 item level 385 piece and 60 Residuum from your first Season 2 chest.)<br>
The weekly cache that becomes available in the second week of the season will not be affected by this cap, so if a player does a Mythic 10 dungeon during the first week, they will get a Mythic 10 reward (item level 410+) from their cache the following week.<br>
<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
<br>
Season 2 rewards from rated PvP sources are 30 item levels higher than they were in Season 1, including Conquest rewards and the weekly chest.<br>
End-of-match rewards will be capped at 385 during the first week of the season, to maintain parity with other endgame systems until Mythic Battle of Dazar&#x2019;alor becomes available.<br>
<br>
<br>
Azerite Armor<br>
<br>
All epic Azerite armor of item level 370 or higher, obtained from Battle of Dazar&#x2019;alor, world quest emissaries, Season 2 dungeons, or Season 2 PvP, will have a fifth outer ring with additional spec-specific traits.<br>
<br>
This outer ring only requires a Heart level of 15 to access.<br>
<br>
Titan Residuum is not reset or capped between seasons.<br>
The Residuum vendor will offer item level 385, 400, and 415 pieces for sale in Season 2.<br>
<br>
A random item-level 385 token costs 165 (as it does today)<br>
A random 400 costs 675<br>
A random 415 costs 1725<br>
A specific item-level 415 armor piece costs 7150<br>
<br>
Just as Residuum costs roughly triple with each 15-ilvl tier, so will rewards:<br>
<br>
Disenchanting an item level 400 Azerite piece yields 115 Residuum<br>
Disenchanting an item level 415 Azerite piece yields 365 Residuum<br>
A weekly cache for a Mythic 4 in Season 2 awards roughly the same 60 Residuum that a Mythic 10 did in Season 1; a Mythic 10 in Season 2 will award ~625 Residuum<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Miscellaneous<br>
<br>
Seals of Wartorn Fate are not being reset, and the same currency will work for Battle of Dazar&#x2019;alor and Season 2 bonus rolls; the cap on how many can be held at once remains at 5.<br>
<br>
<br>
If anything remains unclear or seems to be missing from the above, please let us know and we&#x2019;ll try to clarify as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
<br>
Zandalari &amp; Kul Tiran Allied Race Testing<br>
We&#x2019;ve seen some confusion about the unlock requirements for Zandalari and Kul Tirans, and how that relates to testing them on the PTR. We&#x2019;d like to clarify where things stand currently, and what our plans are once they&#x2019;re officially released.<br>
<br>
The basic requirements to unlock Zandalari and Kul Tiran are as follows:<br>
<br>
<br>
Exalted with that race&#x2019;s faction<br>
Completed the content achievement for that race (&#x201C;Zandalar Forever!&#x201D; or &#x201C;A Nation United,&#x201D; respectively)<br>
Completed the Tides of Vengeance War Campaign achievement<br>
<br>
<br>
On the PTR, we&#x2019;ve enabled the last part of the War Campaign earely, so that the Allied Race unlock quests can be started. As long as you satisfy the other requirements, and are at 3/4 of the requirements for the Tides of Vengeance War Campaign achievement, you&#x2019;ll be able to speak to Nathanos on the Banshee&#x2019;s Wail or Halford Wyrmbane on the Wind&#x2019;s Redemption to get started unlocking Allied Races on the PTR.</div></div>
