Warlords of Draenor - Solar Spirehawk Mount
You may remember the Stormcrow mount http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3320-Patch-5-4-Stormcrow-Mount-Ghostcrawler-Interview-Blue-Posts-News-Recap which was added to the files during Patch 5.4, but never went live. A similar fiery mount has appeared : Solar Spirehawk http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/171828-solar-spirehawk.

Some people appear to have forgotten as of late, so keep in mind that this is beta. Animations, models, sounds, and everything else are not final.

FEEDBACK: Highmaul - Walled City LFR
Highmaul seems to be open before Twins so technically he could be the first boss.

Ye but its very wierd that Tectus is simply not there. The achiev is called the Walled City after all and thats clearly the "first floor" of Higmaul. It would be senseless if the second wing started on Tectus and had the other 3 bosses when the area where the last 3 bosses are situated is clearly distinct from the area of the first 4. just make it so that the first wing has Kargath, Tectus, Butcher and Brakenspore and the second wing the other 3 bosses.
We changed the wing structure and the achievement hasn't been updated yet - that's fixed next build.

The first wing consists of these three bosses. The second wing consists of Tectus, Twin Ogron, and Ko'ragh. There will be some obstacles to bar your path when this is all finalized, and the zone-in location logic is currently letting you wander around parts of the city that should be inaccessible. Converting a non-linear layout into a linear path for Raid Finder is nothing new e.g. the door to Blackfuse being locked when you queue for Underhold, or the entrance to Spoils being closed for Downfall. We want to keep Raid Finder wings to 3 bosses maximum unless we have absolutely no choice, to help keep the time commitment for doing a wing to a reasonable level.

Hunter Feedback
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter / Skills http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter / WoD Talent Calculator http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M
Hey all. Please focus on continuing to give good feedback, not the style/amount of our responses to said feedback. We're just extremely busy, not ignoring or spiteing you.

Now then... Yes, the Marksmanship and Survival rotations are simpler than they were before. The goal is to have a simpler baseline rotation, and have meaningful choices that allow you to layer more depth onto that in talents, if you choose.

Hunters have a ton of talents which grant rotational or short CD abilities, to support this design. However, they were lacking in rotational depth. The gameplay of most of them boiled down to "use on cooldown". No need to think about preparing for when you're going to use it, or how it interacts with your rotation, etc. So, we're going to make some tweaks to try to add some rotational depth to several of the talent choices.


Barrage is being changed to make it more rotational, with Focus-pooling gameplay required to min/max its benefit. You'll want to pool 60 Focus in anticipation of it coming off cooldown. 
Barrage now has a 20sec CD down from 30sec, costs 60 Focus up from 30 Focus, and deals 100% additional damage. Murder of Crows had a cooldown-shortening effect that hardly mattered in practice; either the fight would likely be over within 1min if used on a low-healh boss, or you'd likely waste most of the damage of the crows if used on a low-health add. Instead, we're changing that mechanic, so that it's primarily useful on those low-health adds. You'll want to time it well to finish off low health targets, while still being as Focus-efficient as possible.
Murder of Crows has been changed. Its duration, cost, and cooldown have been reduced by 50%. It no longer has a shorter cooldown when used on low health targets. Instead, its cooldown is reset if the target dies. The gameplay of Fervor and Dire Beast were extremely similar, so we opted to replace Fervor completely. It's rather late in the development process to be doing that, so went with something tried and true: Steady Focus. This iteration of Steady Focus purely increases Focus regeneration, and has a duration short enough to add depth.
Fervor has been replaced with Steady Focus: Using Cobra Shot or Steady Shot twice in a row, or using Focusing Shot, increases your Focus Regeneration by 50% for 10 sec.

We think that these changes will allow Hunters of all types to customize their gameplay to their liking.

Oh, completely forgot that another relevant change hasn't made it into one of your builds yet. Apologies.

Lock and Load is returning to the previous version of it, and Multistrikes will simply do more damage for Survival instead.

To clarify.. is it reverting to how it works on Live servers or the version that relies on Black Arrow. I assume the Black Arrow one which I am pretty okay with.
It's changing to... 20% chance on Black Arrow tick not multistrikes, and guaranteed to get at least 1 proc per Black Arrow cast. Effect is to reset ExS's cooldown, and cause the next two ExSs to cost no focus and trigger no cooldown.

Lots of responses like this so far:

These changes are great. However, they still don't address anything about MM's core issues.
We don't view specs by their baseline untalented rotations, because their baseline untalented rotations never matter. What matters is the complete package. The complete package includes some baseline abilities, some talent on rows where all affect your rotation, and some optional rotation-affecting talents to complicate things further. It makes it very customizable. Most of you are quite experienced and will enjoy significant added rotational complexity, which is available to you.

Oh one more VERY important thing: Will the LnL effect have a 10 second internal cooldown as it does on live? Would be fantastic if it didn't.
No.

This is concerning. It means that "cookie cutter" talent builds are coming back, correct? Despite the possibility to choose, it seems that we'll be stuck at a "superior" talent choice e.g. the L45 row for warriors
No, that is not implied in what I said.

Although pretty the spell effect for Light of Dawn looks like an explosion, could we get a glyph so it looks less like raid AE?
No need; only you see it like that. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501284231457161216
M'kay still annoying but i assume it won't take long to get used too.

Why not make both %healing? That way after first tier they won't be nearly worthless. In MoP Pots went from 20% to ~3%
Hyperbole is a wonderful thing, isn't it?But no, crafted items need to be replaced each expansion. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501826442934489088
I'd like to see how far Versatility takes the Tonic/HS each tier before I call the flat base heal "worthless."
Versatility would indeed affect both of them. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501828218525978624

does the change to improved server responsiveness have any impact on the "not in range" problem with melee?
Somewhat, yes, though not as huge as it does on other issues. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501844025876312065

Can BrM get healing spheres back? And/or afterlife glyph effect for BrM too? Hard cast surging mists != the ease of droping orbs

Merging two Blessings would free up a keybind for paladins. Is there a reason why we have two of them?
Because the alternative isn't merging, it's removing. Having two blessings is a slight *gain* for Paladins. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501251561201233920

any thoughts of the manditory beacon of faith switching gameplay holy pala got atm? You guys happy with it being as effective?
Happy with it being a minor min/maxy thing, yeah. As long as its impact stays minor. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501275428636467201
BoF is mandatory which makes Glyph of BoL mandatory aswell. Any chance the glyph baseline will become baseline?
Neither of those is true. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501288628681596928
how are we supposed to build HP if not with macroing glyped BoL or BoF with HL/FoL?
The same way you always have. You don't have to go *that* heavy on HoPo abilities, you realize, right? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501295925965230080
Like, if you do that, you're giving up a significant amount of healing elsewhere. That's not insignificant. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501296041430241280
So with casting HR? That's way too expensive. or are you also tuning that with the healer tuning passes?
HR is one tool you have, sure. You also can just use beacons as beacons, and heal. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501297293417402372
I mean, obviously, the quintessential healing style for Paladins is to Beacon a tank, heal the party with HL/WoG/LoD. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501297650608517121
The problem with that is that all our non-HP abilities heal for a pittance currently.
Not if you're actually using your Beacons for healing, instead of HoPo. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501299382910992384
What about the other 100 talents then? Hope you can make those viable as well.
Indeed we can. Talents have strengths and weaknesses. Ignoring them is a bad idea. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501307208278097920

In comparison to most specs in the game. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/501204709764366338

Chastise is more of an interrupt than a CC, it's short and constantly on DR. May change in WoD but maybe make it 4-5s?
It allows you to set up further CC. I don't see us buffing the duration of Chastise. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/501205637854801920

We don't have 4, two are on same tier and why are you brushing aside the weaknesses highlights? Address our concerns!
I'm brushing them aside because they are all totally reasonable "weaknesses." There are 4 in MoP. They left out scream holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/501203933142843392
Scream, Fiend, Tendrils, MC, Silence, Horror, Chastise. Shadow=4, Holy=3, Disc=2. Easily counterable is not reasonable!

Why does Siegebreaker replace Intimidating? It's a one second knock-down..on a 45sec CD...
Frequency matters a lot, as does the power of the knockback. We don't want to increase Warrior CC. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501828154990661632

right now it's like 10-15 yards. Honestly put the stun on the end up 1-2 seconds and it fits better where DR is now.
Yeah, it's a knock *back*, of about 10yd. That's a big deal, especially on a Warrior. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501830551775358976
In what scenario would you want to knock them away from you?
When you want to interrupt a cast. When you have Charge up. When you want to knock a target out of an AOE clump, to CC it. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501831559419142145
When you've just Heroic Leaped past them and want to knock them back toward your teammates. When you want to get a mob to a clump. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501831718026743808

.. You should just remove the knock-down then. As that basically makes the talent unusable in pvp. Maybe that's the point but...
Uhh... So very confused. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501828369554493440
Giving up intim is a lot to ask for. You're giving up one ability for another... Trading CC for damage...
And for a different but also quite strong CC. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501829971224961024
Not found of new lvl 100 talent to be honest. It looks like nerfed DR. 1 sec is a strong cc? Not really.
It's not DR'd, and the knockback is the big part of its CC value. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501833080949460992
Why not put it on the stun tier instead if it's meant to be a strong CC?
Because it's a tradeoff, not a direct gain. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501834006480973824

after all these changes, warriors get a new talent because they had a boring passive one. What about venom rush? Thoughts?
That's distinctly *not* why Ignite Weapon was replaced. And it wasn't boring/passive anyway. A passive on each row is a good thing. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501666844105666561
If the passive is good/fun design. Basic resource regeneration for the final tier is underwhelming?
With a bit of gameplay of trying to maintain it on multiple targets? Yes. We like to have one talent that doesn't complexify things. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501668596318076930
I worry you don't realize how big Ignite Weap was for us who -hate- CS pooling gameplay. RB extending CS just further added 2 it

I gotta ask, what is design philosophy in making the CD's on Mr Smite's Compass, Manastorm Duplicator, et al so long 2 hours!!!

Warlords of Draenor Stats
What's the secondary stat value design philosophy in Warlords? Worth 1/4 as much as Primary stats? 1/2 as much? Equal to?
Generally 1/2. Spirit and Bonus Armor are more in the realm of 3/4. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501508588150329344
Those are rough estimates though; what's important is that secondaries are balanced against each other. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501508691992903680

why not 100% chance to hit, 0% chance to be dodged, 3% chance to be parried, 3% chance to be blocked for everyone?

Fair enough, but is a list not already in existence between the idea and the actual code changes being made?
Yes. There's just a lot of work that goes into getting it into full Patch Note quality. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501532818145415168

So the official story is Gamon died I guess to the heroic fight? Even though you can save him in normal mode.
