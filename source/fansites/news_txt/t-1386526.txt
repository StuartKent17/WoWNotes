A portal into Warcraft history has ripped open, and the fifth World of Warcraft expansion has been revealed! Warlords of Draenor sends players to the savage world of Draenor—home of the mighty orcs and haven of the mystic draenei—to fight against and alongside legends from Warcraft’s brutal past.

Amid Draenor’s untamed jungles and battle-scarred plains, a merciless new Iron Horde has been forged from the mighty orc clans of old. To save their own world from impending invasion, Azeroth’s heroes will need to explore the far reaches of this unforgiving land, achieving new heights of power on their way to the new level cap of 100. To establish a foothold on Draenor, players will construct, command, and expand their own Garrison, a customizable base of operations and refuge for the followers you recruit to your desperate cause. Warlords of Draenor also empowers players to instantly boost one character to level 90, making it so anyone can join the battle for Draenor alongside their friends.
