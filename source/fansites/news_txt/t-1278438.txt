Something New
We've got something new to share, and we're bringing it to PAX East! If you're attending, be sure to arrive at the Naga theater early in order to secure a seat for our presentation. If you're not going to PAX East this year or you just went a little too crazy the night before, we've got you covered -- the whole thing is being streamed live on the official PAX Twitch channel  at 10:00 a.m. EDT Friday, March 22.

The Great Jewel of PAX East
Gather your gear, heroes, and get ready to face down the Burning Hells on the PlayStation 3!

Our action-packed single-player hands-on demo will showcase several key elements that make Diablo III on the PS3 so much fun, including a reimagined interface and inventory system, direct character control, updated camera, and bosses and monsters specifically tuned for console. Players will also get to experience gameplay from Act III of the campaign where they’ll get to test their mettle as either the cunning Demon Hunter or mighty Barbarian.


      

We'll have demo stations available from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. EDT in booth #1036 of the Expo Hall, so if you’re in the area and in the mood for some ritual demon slaughter, be sure to stop by and check it out!

RNG is RNG: Raffles, Giveaways, and More...
In addition to showcasing the PS3 version of Diablo III and chatting you up about the game as you saunter by, we'll also be giving away enough swag and prizes to make a Treasure Goblin jealous.


  

The Diablo III team will be sharing updates, photos, and more live from the convention floor, so be sure to "Like" us on Facebook  and follow our official Twitter  feed so you don't miss out.

For those who are Boston-bound, we salute you . . . and hope to see you there!

Cross-Realm Zones and Mounts
Don't think people have realized yet but the "zoning" issue that used to knock people off of 2 person mounts and kill them, it has been fixed. BUT now the issue has arised where I am getting DC'ed every time I'm between zones trying to "remount" once a zone line has been crossed.
We did manage to fix the 2 person mount issue, but yes, we know there's still an intermittent disconnect issue that we want to correct as well. We know what we need to do to fix it *crosses her fingers* but it won't be able to happen for a bit longer potentially the next patch. We're continuing to work to improve it. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

The Crumbled Chamberlain
Good news, we're applying a hotfix to address the Crumbled Chamberlain pieces respawn. It should be in after this morning's restarts. Pieces will then spawn in the same locations for that day, but will change locations the following and so on. This way, if someone snags the piece you're going for, it's not going to jump to a new location. You'll still be able to get it. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Throne of Thunder Difficulty Feedback
Throne of Thunder normal isn't tuned assuming you are a Heroic raiding guild. If your raid is still progressing through Tier 14 say, at Garalon it's very likely you'll be able to only kill Jin'rokh and then face a very difficult battle trying to slay Horridon or Council of Elders, though.

In that case and for the guilds still progressing through T14 it probably makes more sense to go back clear the rest of Tier 14 which is now more doable thanks to the 10% reduction in damage and health of bosses as well as the new VP gear you can get with 5.2 Patch. 

Guilds that have completed Tier 14 Normal already should be able to progress through Throne of Thunder. Of course, you might not clear all of it in a couple weeks, but it's something definitely doable without getting Heroic gear from Tier 14 gear from Normal Tier 15 is higher item level.

On the other hand, it's also important to keep in mind that Jin'rokh is a rather easy boss. He's not necessarily a representation of the rest of the raid's difficulty. Which is something many of you have probably noticed while progressing on Horridon or Council of Elders. And that might set a wrong expectation as to how quickly you can/should progress in Throne of Thunder. It's very possible to kill Jin'rokh without much difficulty and then suddenly feel like Horridon is a brick wall, don't despair!

There are many encounters in Throne of Thunder that your raid will have to learn. And it's normal to feel things may be overtuned at the beginning of a new raiding tier while everyone is trying to better understand what each boss does and how to execute the fight properly. 

Not everything comes down to how much gear your raid has. In fact, you might overgear, say, Horridon, and yet be unable to progress past him due to an inefficient strategy.

In any case, the developers are keeping an eye out on how things are going, and they will be making adjustments as needed. Ideally, no one should find him/herself in a situation where it looks like it's impossible to win without getting more gear and unable to actually get more gear. 

So, don't give up. Go get those VP items some items from Raid Finder might help as well, absolutely and keep refining your strategies. The boss kills will come. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
