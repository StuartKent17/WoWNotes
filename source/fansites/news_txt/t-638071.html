Tonight, we saw the first preview of the stats of a Tier 8 set on the PTRs, for the moment they&apos;re only T7.25 sets with an higher ilvl (and armor).<br>
<br>

<br>
I guess it&apos;s a good time to post the final preview of the Tier 8 models, there are actually plenty of changes since the last time I posted screenshots of tier 8. The biggest change is probably that all the &quot;old&quot; tier 8 sets have been upgraded with high-resolution textures. Here are the changes for each class since the last time I posted these sets:<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight - Higher resolution textures.<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid - All races added, robe version of the set added.<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter - Higher resolution textures.<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage - Higher resolution textures, and finally decided that the pants version of the set might be the final version for players. As of today there isn&apos;t any texture for Tier 8 Mage robe in the game files.<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin - All races added, robe version of the set added.<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest - Higher resolution textures.<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue - Higher resolution textures. There are still a few bugs with this set and the green recolor isn&apos;t available on male characters, undead females are also unavailable. <br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman - All races added, robe version of the set added.<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock - Higher resolution textures.<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior - All races added.<br>
<br>
There is also a very high definition screenshot available for each set.<br>
