This Week in WoW History<br>
We&apos;re taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br>
<br>
Tier 11 Models Released<br>
The first raid in the Cataclysm brought us some great looking sets which were featured in 2010 prior to the release of Blackwing Descent. This was the first raid where loot was normalized in 10 and 25 man modes, allowing guilds to choose which raid size they wanted to go with. <br>

<br>
<br>
Incoming Cataclysm<br>
In 2010 a short TV commercial aired, giving all World of Warcraft fans a Cataclysm teaser. The full trailer was also released on YouTube, which showed us Deathwing bringing the Cataclysm to Azeroth. Expansion trailer reveals typically happen at BlizzCon, however this was released over a week before it, which further built the anticipation for more details to be shared at the event.<br>

Mists of Pandaria Announcement<br>
Mists of Pandaria was officially announced, showing off the new race and class to come in the next expansion. With this post we also got some information, such as the level cap being raised, pet battle system being added, and our talent system being redesigned. <br>

Endgineer Omegaplugg - Let the Puzzles Begin<br>
One of many secrets discovered in Legion was the hidden boss in Gnomeregan. This was a 5 man boss, which was summoned by pushing a hidden button in the room of the last boss. This new boss was also much more difficult than the typical dungeon boss, which required players to be well geared, and execute a clever strategy to deal with all of his mechanics. After defeating him, the group was rewarded with the Vial of Green Goo (http://www.wowdb.com/items/141331-vial-of-green-goo) toy.<br>

This book is still available for purchase on Amazon, so if you wanted to bring the tastes of Azeroth meals to your home, it&#x2019;s time to pick one up (https://www.amazon.com/World-Warcraft-Official-Chelsea-Monroe-Cassel/dp/160887804X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mmochamp-20).<br>
