When you head into a mine, take a light.

There are a number of corrections to the text of tooltips in the latest test build, but the actual damage done by most of those abilities hasn't changed.

The tooltips for Frost Strike, Death Strike, Festering Strike, Devastate, Blood Frenzy and Critical Mass were all corrected. The damage on these abilities has NOT changed.

There are actual changes to Savage Defense, Swipe, Thrash, Cleansing Waters, Arcane Blast and Arcane Explosion in recent builds.
