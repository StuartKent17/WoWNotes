Boubouille2007-05-25, 08:27 PMReminder ! Loot tables of Hyjal and Black Temple bosses are available here 

Last update : Nihilum  managed to get a world first kill on High Warlord Naj'entus and Supremus too, which means 4 world first kill in the same night, not bad I guess. 






Update 3 : Forte  killed Winterchill too, loots were Furious Shackles and Howling Wind Bracers

Update 2 : Rage Winterchill, first boss of Hyjal Summit down.
Only one quest item dropped, but it was a bug, this was hotfixed and Nihilum got reimbursed.
The other loots were :

Blessed Adamantite Bracers
Tracker's Blade
Blood-Stained Pauldrons
Howling Wind Bracers
Chronicle of Dark Secrets

Update : Forte  also killed Kael'thas tonight, their loots were :
[Band of the Ranger-General]
[The Nexus Key]

Which means our small loot list speculation at the bottom of this news is accurate, hurray for us.

Nihilum  just killed Kael'thas Sunstrider, last boss of Tempest Keep. 


 

Loots



These are the T5 Token, the Attunement Scroll, and the Verdant Sphere, the other loots are rewards from the Verdant Sphere.
 

They also got 25 Kael's Vial Remnant

Other possible drops from Kael'thas See my post  for a complete explanation
[Band of the Ranger-General]
[Sunshower Light Cloak]
[Thalassian Wildercloak]
[The Nexus Key]
[Twinblade of the Phoenix]
