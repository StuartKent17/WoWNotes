weaponGet Your Artifact Weapon to at Least 35 Traits<br>
Patch 7.2 introduces reworks to the existing Artifact Weapon system: <br>
<br>
Once you&#x2019;ve earned 35 traits in your Artifact Weapons, you&#x2019;ll be eligible for a new questline to empower your weapon.<br>
Once completed, you&apos;ll be able to spend Artifact Power on new Empowered traits (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/artifact-traits?filter-patch=23436), new ranks for existing traits, and a new Infinite trait (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/239042-concordance-of-the-legionfall?artifactRank=1), which features 50 ranks.<br>
Players who have put Artifact Power into their weapons beyond 35 traits will have all of this AP refunded and be able to allocate it to new traits.<br>
Previously earned Artifact Power items will not be usable on the empowered Artifact Weapon, so don&apos;t stockpile your AP tokens.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;hr&gt;<br>
knowledgeCap Your Artifact Knowledge<br>
<br>
Be sure that your artifact knowledge is maxed out.<br>
If you&#x2019;re researching on an alt character, you can purchase Artifact Research Compendiums (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Compendium&amp;filter-quality=64) on your main to speed things along.<br>
Make sure to hold on to enough Order Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources) for class hall upgrades. <br>
You can see the new Artifact Knowledge multipliers here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6377-Patch-7-2-PTR-Build-23657#newak).<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;hr&gt;<br>
orderComplete Order Hall Class Campaign<br>
<br>
To continue with your order hall campaign in 7.2, you must have completed all currently available order hall quests.<br>
In 7.2, players can earn a new champion, class-specific achievements, and the achievement Champions of Legionfall (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11846-champions-of-legionfall), which is required for Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Two (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11446-broken-isles-pathfinder-part-two).<br>
Completion of the order hall class campaign awards your class-specific flying mount. You can check them out here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6265-Patch-7-2-PTR-Build-23436-Class-Mount-Models).<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;hr&gt;<br>
upgradesCollect 25,000 Order Resources for New Order Hall Research<br>
<br>
If you haven&#x2019;t already been stockpiling Order Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources), you&#x2019;ll want to start farming in order to purchase the two new order hall upgrades.<br>
The first upgrade (tier 7) costs 10,000 x Order Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources) and takes one day to research.<br>
The second (tier 8) costs 15,000 x Order Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources) and research completion will take 5 days.<br>
You&#x2019;ll also need Order Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources) for purchasing new artifact knowledge ranks (which now caps at 40).<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;hr&gt;<br>
flyingEarn the Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part One Achievement<br>
<br>
Complete the first Broken Isles Pathfinder achievement so you can work towards Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Two once the patch is live.<br>
<br>
<br>
As a recap, here&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;ll need to do to earn that first achievement:<br>
<br>
Broken Isles Explorer (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11188-broken-isles-explorer) - Explore the regions of the Broken Isles<br>
Variety is the Spice of Life (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11189-variety-is-the-spice-of-life) - Complete 100 different world quests<br>
A Glorious Campaign (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/10994-a-glorious-campaign) - Complete your class order hall campaign<br>
Loremaster of Legion (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11157-loremaster-of-legion) - Requires completion of all Legion zone achievements.<br>
<br>
Good Suramaritan will be the most time consuming achievement (though no longer gated) and is the only one which requires a boss kill, Xavius in Emerald Nightmare for The Emerald Nightmare: The Stuff of Dreams. This quest can be completed on any raid difficulty (including LFR).<br>
<br>
Broken Isles Diplomat (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/10672-broken-isles-diplomat) <br>
<br>
Earn Revered with The Wardens (http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1894-the-wardens), Court of Farondis (http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1900-court-of-farondis), The Dreamweavers (http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1883-dreamweavers), Highmountain Tribe (http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1828-highmountain-tribe), The Nightfallen (http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1859-the-nightfallen) and The Valarjar (http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1948-valarjar)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
repMax Reputations to Exalted for the Paragon System<br>
<br>
You&apos;re now able to keep earning reputation with a faction even after reaching Exalted.<br>
For each 20,000 reputation earned past Exalted, you will earn a supply reward similar to those awarded by Emissary Quests.<br>
These supply rewards have a chance to drop new, faction-exclusive mounts and toys.<br>
After earning 10 of these rewards, you&#x2019;ll earn the achievement Paragon of the Broken Isles (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11653-paragon-of-the-broken-isles).<br>
You won&#x2019;t be able to gain reputation from insignias earned from world quests, so there&#x2019;s no point in holding onto those.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the reward items you&#x2019;ll have a chance to receive:<br>
<br>
Cloudwing Hippogryph (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/147806-cloudwing-hippogryph) from Farondis Chest (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146897-farondis-chest)<br>
Highmountain Elderhorn (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/242874-highmountain-elderhorn) from Highmountain Supplies (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146899-highmountain-supplies)<br>
Leywoven Flying Carpet (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/233364-leywoven-flying-carpet)from Nightfallen Cache (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146900-nightfallen-cache)<br>
Sira&#x2019;s Extra Cloak (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/147843-siras-extra-cloak) from Warden Supply Kit (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146902-wardens-supply-kit)<br>
Valarjar Stormwing (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/242882-valarjar-stormwing) from Valarjar Strongbox (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146901-valarjar-strongbox)<br>
Wild Dreamrunner (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/242875-wild-dreamrunner) from Dreamweaver Cache (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146898-dreamweaver-cache)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
championsLevel Class Hall Champions<br>
<br>
Level all Class Hall Champions to 110 and cap their item level.<br>
All Champions will now be able to reach Legendary quality, which unlocks a third equipment slot.<br>
Once Legendary, Champions will not be able to earn any more experience.<br>
You&#x2019;ll be able to have one more active Champion, so make sure you have six Champions ready for missions.<br>
Don&#x2019;t forget that you can take Combat Ally Champions with you on world quests.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
matsGather Materials for New Crafted BoE Legendary Items<br>
<br>
The first crafted item level 940 Legendary items have been added.<br>
These four items are Bind on Equipped and can be sold on the Auction House.<br>

<br>
<br>
Not all of these items will be available prior to the patch, as many special new reagents have been added solely for these crafting specific items.<br>
These legendary crafting materials are obtained through new quest chains.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
sellSell Excess Gathered Materials Before Flying is Unlocked<br>
<br>
Now that players will be able to fly, farming gathered materials such as herbs and minerals should be considerably easier than before.<br>
Because of this, Auction House prices will likely fluctuate.<br>
Consider selling any unneeded, stockpiled materials.<br>
Hold onto materials that are used in crafting 7.2&#x2019;s new BoE legendaries, including Stonehide Leather (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124113-stonehide-leather), Stormscale (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124115-stormscale), Felslate (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/123919-felslate)and Leystone Ore (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/123918-leystone-ore)for Demonsteel Bar (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124461-demonsteel-bar), and Shal&#x2019;dorei Silk (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124437-shaldorei-silk)for Imbued Silkweave (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127004-imbued-silkweave).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
petsLevel Battle Pets<br>
<br>
Patch 7.2 introduces the first Pet Battle Dungeon, Wailing Critters (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/45423-wailing-critters).<br>
You&#x2019;ll need to be level 110 and have one level 25 pet for the one-time scenario, but it&apos;s ideal to have three level 25 pets.<br>
You&#x2019;ll need 15 max level pets for the Pet Battle Challenge: Wailing Caverns (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/45539-pet-battle-challenge-wailing-caverns)weekly scenario.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
transmogCollect Transmog Items<br>
<br>
Patch 7.2 adds a new &#x201C;Sets&#x201D; tab to the Appearances interface, so you can browse all item sets available to your character and see which items you are missing.<br>
The interface will tell you where to get the items, so you can complete missing sets.<br>
New achievements, such as Mogg-Saron (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11751-mogg-saron) and Sha of Fabulous (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11757-sha-of-fabulous), have been added for collecting PVE and PVP item sets.<br>
Earning 10 of these achievements will earn you the character title, &#x201C;Stylist (http://ptr.wowdb.com/titles/505-stylist),&#x201D; awarded by Azeroth&#x2019;s Next Top Model (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11761-azeroths-next-top-model).<br>

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/us-en.png Estimated US Rating Cutoffs for Legion Season 2<br>
Over the last few PvP seasons, we&#x2019;ve seen an increased request from the community for Blizzard to publish projected estimates of how much PvP rating a character will need in order to be awarded a title. We&#x2019;ve been discussing the idea, and would like to give it a try.<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT: What follows is purely an estimation based on current ladder rankings and participation. The final cutoffs will only be determined once Legion Season 2 has actually concluded, and have the potential to be significantly different than what is listed below due to a wide variety of factors. Meeting or exceeding one of these cutoffs does not in any way guarantee that you will receive that tier of rewards once the season has ended.<br>
<br>
Estimated 3v3 Arena Cutoffs:<br>
<br>
<br>
Fearless Gladiator (Horde): 2820<br>

These are not a guarantee of what will be finalized once the season has finished.<br>
