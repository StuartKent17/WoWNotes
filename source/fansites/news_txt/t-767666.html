The test realms have been updated with a new PTR build, this build is tagged as (Release) and seems to be a release candidate for live servers, it&apos;s a very small patch with only a few changes to spell data. You can still expect the patch on October 5th or 12th as far as I&apos;m concerned.<br>

Achievements Changes<br>
A couple of beta achievements have been updated and some of the &quot;old&quot; achievements have been reverted to fit the 4.0.1 environment (you have to kill Thrall in Orgrimmar instead of Garrosh, etc ...). Blizzard is definitely polishing for live release. <br>

Spell Changes<br>
