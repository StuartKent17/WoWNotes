Warlords of Draenor Developer Interviews
There were a few developer interviews at the recent press events, so today we are taking a look at interviews with Alex Afrasiabi from Ausgamers http://www.ausgamers.com/features/read/3420634. Most of the information has already been covered in other interviews, but there are a few new things:


Warlords of Draenor has roughly 10 new mounts.
Warlords of Draenor has roughly 10 new scenarios.
Garrisons could come to Azeroth in the future if the devs feel like it is the right decision based on what they learn from Warlords of Draenor.



Cross-Realm Normal Siege of Orgrimmar and Feat of Strength Achievements
The idea of being able to do Cross-Realm Siege of Orgrimmar in normal difficulty came up again recently, but the chances don't appear much better than they did a few months ago. It appears that the Siege of Orgrimmar Feat of Strength achievements http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/character/feats-of-strength?filter-patch=17056&filter-search=garrosh will also be removed with Patch 6.0.

New Character Models - Face Variations
There has been some concern http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1471213-So-the-new-character-models-suffer-from-quot-Same-face-quot-as-the-Pandaren-do-too about the variety of faces offered with the new models. It looks like we will get some answers in a future Artcraft post!

Warlords of Draenor Flying
It's only in the new areas. There is no difference than any other past expansions. You cannot fly at the beginning of expansions cata being the one exception. I'm sure we will all live.
This is pretty true. You couldn't get flying in Outland until you reached maximum level and bought the skill. Wrath of the Lich King you couldn't fly right away either. The same recently for Mists of Pandaria in which until you reached the maximum level to get the ability to do so. This is not new for an expansion to not allow flying immediately upon entering into a new expansion. 

That said, the developers are also aware of the concerns that people may have about how easy or difficult it will be to get around to the various locations. They have said before that they want to still provide convenient ways for people to still travel without minimizing the impact on exploration within the zones. As always, we welcome constructive feedback and discussion provided it's kept constructive. We'll also continue to keep an eye on things not only within beta when that occurs but also when we go live to see just how people truly end up playing and interacting.

I just wanted to take a moment to reiterate that constructive feedback is great –we love it– and also to reemphasize that our goal is not to make it take longer to travel from zone to zone. We're not looking to make things inconvenient or a big time sink, we want to make sure that you're getting where you need to go in as convenient of a way as we possibly can. We said this much at BlizzCon already and that still holds true.

We will do our best to keep everyone as up to date on ongoing developments as we can.

Venom Zest sounds cool. one thing I'm worried about is a talent having only a choice for 1 specific spec.
We don't do that, there's always a choice in each slot for every spec. Venom Zest is for all 3 specs. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438128274548334592
I meant as an example for other talents. That one favors assassination for example. Works for others but preferred for X.
A talent doesn't need to be exactly balanced between specs, just close. It needs to be well balanced against is its *row*. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438131759046074368

Art
I know it's bit trivial in the broad scope but will the faction flight mounts get a model update? Wyverns/Bats look clunky
I agree, this is another one of those-hope to, but can't get to soon enough desires. On the radar, no eta artofcgrobinson https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/431842471908093952

Proving Grounds
silver proving grounds for heroics?? With what gear may I ask? I could not do silver until I had 520 ilevel, doing it with quest greens will be a joke. 
Proving Grounds normalizes your gear to 463s. Quest Greens would be hard, but anything 463+ should be fine. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438037592131383297

So, we're thinking of Tradeskills as a vector for high dedication. hwoome https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/433390185443627008
We'd like for there to be something to progress towards, even if you don't have access to high end raiding, hwoome https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/433390811045060608
like, not part of a high end raiding guild, may not have the best internet connection, etc. hwoome https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/433391148518735872
Something you can achieve as player who may not have access to those things, but who loves to play, and does so regularly. hwoome https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/433391771402260480
We try to tune things so that high intensity players don't feel like it's mandatory, however. How are we doing? hwoome https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/433392412182867969
