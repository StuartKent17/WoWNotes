Patch 2.4 XP Changes - WotLK preview ?
It looks like a change went unnoticed on the 2.4 PTRs, Blizzard changed the XP required to level up at ... 70 ! Before the patch players needed 814,700 XP to level to 71, but since tuesday you need about 50% more xp to reach this level, bringing the total to 1,256,500 XP. According to a few reports this change was made because of an interface bug but increasing the max xp by 50k or 100k would have been enough to fix it, this leaves us with another theory : leveling in WotLK will require 50% more xp than what you needed in BC, it wouldn't be surprising and would be equal to the same difference of XP between Burning Crusade and WoW classic.

Europe - Arena Tournament opening time
As we’ve moved into Daylight Saving Time since the publication of the Arena Tournament Official Competition Rules, we’d like to clarify that the intended opening time for the Arena Tournament is 10:00 GMT, i.e. 12:00 noon CEST Paris time and thus 11:00 BST London time.

Update 12:20 CEST: There has been a delay in opening the tournament realms. We will update you with new information as soon as possible.

Telia resolves internet dispute with Cogent
[i] The internet traffic dispute between Telia Sonera and US-based Cogent Communications has been resolved. A new contract has been signed between the two firms and affected customers have regained full access to the internet.

"We are happy to have signed a new contract with Cogent and regret that some of our customers have been affected by the dispute," said Malin Frenning CEO of Telia Sonera International Carrier, Dagens Nyheter DN writes.

The dispute began at around 11pm on March 13th when Cogent decided to cut off communications with Telia Sonera in protest at the "degraded" service it claimed was experienced by its customers. By 6.30pm on Friday the connection was re-established and Cogent customers in the USA could once again access sites hosted by Telia, such as World of Warcraft.
