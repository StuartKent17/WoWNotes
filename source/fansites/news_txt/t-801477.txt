Boubouille2010-12-01, 03:09 AMUpdate - Added November 30 hotfixes http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/136974/patch-403a-hotfixes, including a massive boost to Gamon's already incredible power!

Blizzard Product Slate "Leak"
People are pretty excited about a new picture going around the web, supposedly a leak of the schedule of Blizzard's release for the next year. I don't usually comment that kind of things but ... 


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2010/november/blizzardslate.jpg http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2010/november/blizzardslate.jpg

Source
The image appeared on MMOGamesite.com http://www.mmogamesite.com/news/blizzard-product-slate-leaked.html, apparently this is an english MMO site based in China and I already know a lot of people will hate me for reporting that news. The document itself is probably a slide from an internal presentation to executives and/or shareholders, and seems to be 8 months old according to the date at the top. 

Battle.net 2.0

BNET2 - Well, that's the Battle.net we now use on WoW. 
BNET2MapMarket - This is pretty self explanatory, but I'm a little surprised by the timeline. 
BNET2 3rd Parties - The end-game with Battle.net is as far as I know to compete with Steam. One of the best way to do that would be to use the new platform to distribute a popular game, and if that game was an upcoming Call of Duty title the Activision/Blizzard merge would suddenly make a lot of sense, right?


Starcraft 2
Nothing really new here, but I have no idea what SC2 Phoenix is. 

Diablo 3
Target release date in a year makes sense. The 2 expansions aren't really a surprise but I wouldn't take it as a confirmation, that's usually the kind of stuff you mention in company meetings with the higher-ups to make everyone happy. 

World of Warcraft

WoWMobile - Done/in-progress with the mobile Auction House and the upcoming extra features. 
Cataclysm - Well, we all know about that. 
WoW Brazil - Portuguese translation of the game. I already heard a couple of rumors about that and at this point I'm 99% sure it's true, this is one of the reason why I think this document is legit. The 2 others being the TCG Game and Titan 
WoW X4 - 4th expansion in a year and a half sounds very plausible. 
WoW TCG - TCG Game, this part will probably remind you of one of my old posts ... The Future of World of Warcraft: TCG http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/695208-Future-of-WoW-TCG-Realms-Lag-ICC-Progression
WoW Movie - I'd say the timeline is off because the document is a few months old, before Sam Raimi decided to work on other projects before the Warcraft movie but I still want to believe.
WoW X5 - 5th expansion a year and a half later, nothing surprising.


Titan
Yeah, that's Blizzard's new MMOFPS and I might have hinted at that http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1876-MMO-Champion-acquired-by-Curse in the past but I don't have a lot of extra information about it and the release date is just an estimation. Don't assume that it will be released by the end of 2013 based on that document, it would be very stupid.

Conclusion
The document is probably legit, even if it's already a little old it still confirms and backups a couple of information I already mentioned, and mentions the portuguese translation for the first time in public. Don't take it as a hard fact and don't bring it up too much on official forums but I think it's an interesting piece of information. 


New Forum Titles are here!
The new titles are finally deployed on the forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forum.php and I'm only a few months late! Hopefully it will make the regular forum posters happier and it will be an awesome opportunity for the 40 new moderators I will promote tomorrow to ban hundreds of people trying to boost their post count. See the list below, the post count required for the last 3 titles will remain secret for the moment, it's ridiculously high anyway.

Dungeon Quest Experience Reduction
We are applying a hotfix today to all level 1-60 dungeon quests for Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms dungeons which will significantly reduce the amount of experience they award.

While dungeons should remain integral to our evolving storylines, and great places to collect gear in cooperative environments, we need to make sure each player’s questing progress remains relevant as dungeon quests are completed. In many cases we’re seeing players enter dungeons to complete quests, only to come out ahead of the leveling curve for the zones they’re in.

This change should allow players the opportunity to reap the benefits of running dungeons, while not outpacing the leveling flow from levels 1-60. At this time there are no plans for making any adjustments to dungeon quest experience for Outland, Northrend, and level 80+ Cataclysm dungeons.

You can find a list of all of the latest hotfixes here: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/1232869


Dungeon Level Changes
The Cataclysm has wrought changes to many facets of Azeroth and the dungeons found across the world are no exception. As many of the zones throughout the world now have new level ranges, the dungeons within their borders have been adjusted to match, and the items that drop within those dungeons have had their stats changed accordingly.

Here's a list of all 1-60 dungeons and the level range at which each should be explored, followed by the minimum level required for entry in parentheses.

In order by minimum level to enter.

Blue Posts
City Tabards and reputation in dungeons
If you are wearing one of the new faction tabards e.g. Thunder Bluff, Stormwind, Orgrimmar, Ironforge, etc., you will only receive reputation gains for that city/faction when in Classic 1-60, Northrend 70-80, and Cataclysm 80-85 dungeons. Outland dungeons will not currently provide reputation gains for the "home city" faction you are championing; this is intended.

Also, just as a heads up, if dungeon mobs and bosses are trivial to you, you will receive less reputation than if they are within your level range. This is just to ensure that players who exceed the dungeon's intended level range can still benefit from championing a specific faction, but aren't given a distinct advantage over those who are of the appropriate level and are unable to solo the content. This should also help encourage players to improve their reputation in dungeons more appropriate for their level, rather than running lower level content solely for the reputation which isn't a bad thing by any means; we just want you to enjoy the content designed for your level range, too. : Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/138803/city-tabards-and-bc-dungeons

Aesthetic minor glyphs
We've enjoyed the few that have been made and really hope to continue on with them. A big issue is always time constraints, but the biggest hurdle is probably that we don't have the capability to alter spell effects directly with a glyph yet. The tech doesn't exist for us. Swapping out models, like the two you mentioned, are somewhat easy as long as we like the actual effect and want it in the game. Changing fire to be colored green though, while awesome, isn't as easy.

Some of the things you mentioned are certainly possible, some are quite like never going to happen, and some we just need the tech to pull it off. :

We do indeed though hope to keep adding aesthetic minor glyphs. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/138763/aesthetic-glyphs-great-start-blizzard

Upcoming realm status page
The page itself has undergone some key improvements. Realms will now be sortable by status, name, type Normal, PvP, RP, RP-PvP, population, locale i.e. time zones: Pacific, Mountain, Central, and Eastern, and current queue. Also, when you're logged in, there will be a separate tab that will display the most relevant realms based on where your characters are, allowing you to quickly reference the status of the realms on which you play. : Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/138738/realm-status
