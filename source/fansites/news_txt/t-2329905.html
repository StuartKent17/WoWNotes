A potential trademark for the title World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth was discovered in New Zealand by users in the speculation thread (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2249901-Official-Patch-8-0-Speculation-thread/page2279?p=47830755#post47830755). <br>
<br>
In addition, whenever you type in a random url under the worldofwarcraft.com domain, you will be redirected to the url without any hyphens. <br>
(Example: worldofwarcraft.com/corgisunleashed redirects to worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/corgisunleashed)<br>
<br>
However, when typing in worldofwarcraft.com/battleforazeroth, you are redirected to a page in which hyphens are automatically added to the name: worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/battle-for-azeroth.<br>
