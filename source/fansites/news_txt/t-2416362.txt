Epic Battlegrounds Feedback
Thanks for the lively discussion, everyone! Some updates:

Alterac Valley
We feel Alterac Valley is in a pretty decent spot. We've seen a dip in Alliance win rates, but want to give them time to re-adjust and strategize after the changes. We'll continue to monitor things and make changes where necessary. 

We realize players have a passion for some of Alterac Valley's classic mechanics Ivus, Lokholar. While we have no immediate changes to announce yet, its something we may adjust in the future.

Isle of Conquest
We've identified an issue with the Keep Cannons dealing too much damage to vehicles. We believe this is causing defense to be stronger than intended. We are going to significantly reduce the damage the Keep Cannons deal to vehicles, but still retain their power against players.

Some other additional changes:


When a gate is destroyed, that faction will lose 50 Reinforcements. This will give offense an option of destroying more gates if the opposing team is "turtling." The Siege Engine will now be immune to roots and snares. Health of the Glaive Towers and Demolishers moderately increased. Damage and siege damage of the Airship Cannons significantly increased.

We hope to have these changes live soon, and appreciate your continued feedback. 

Thank You!


The Evolution of World of Warcraft Storytelling
ScienceAlert  has a three part interview with Alex Afrasiabi about the evolution of storytelling in World of Warcraft.


Alex Afrasiabi started with only eight months left before shipping the game.
There were only four or five people adding quests to the game, so there wasn't an overarching story.
Other games at the time, such as Everquest, didn't have a lot of quests.
The goal of quests was to guide players through the zones and have them explore the world, all while telling a story.
Quest designers weren't in charge of spawning NPCs, so they had to work with what was already spawned. 
In the final months before shipping, everyone realized that not letting quest designers do spawning was inefficient so quest designers added spawning to part of their process. 
Moving from Classic to Burning Crusade, quest designers being allowed to spawn things was what allowed quest storylines to become more cohesive and coherent.
That change opened the floodgates for quest designers to tell more concise and directed stories, because they actually now controlled what the world looked like.
Alex pitched putting machinima in the game during Wrath of the Lich King, resulting in Wrathgate!
