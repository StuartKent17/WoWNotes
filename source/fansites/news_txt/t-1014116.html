The winners for the giveaway have been picked, congratulations to them! Since we actually had to buy the pets for this giveaway and aren&apos;t working with codes, I will need winners to send me a PM with a link to their armory profile to know where I should mail the pet in-game.<br>

For those of you who didn&apos;t win and can&apos;t/don&apos;t want to buy one you can probably find the pet at your local auction house for a reasonable price now that the first cubs bought yesterday are no longer bound to their owners.<br>

Patch 4.3: Madness of Deathwing<br>
Once again n1kftw (http://www.youtube.com/user/n1kftw) has supplied us with a video of Madness of Deathwing. The fight is now fully available on PTRs and even if it still needs to be tuned, it should be more accurate than the videos we&apos;ve seen previously.<br>

Blue Posts<br>
Monk Class Color<br>
Right now the monk is jade green. We like the color, but it&apos;s not absolutely set in stone. For those wondering how this would work with the hunter green, it&apos;s as different as the colors are for mages and shaman. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/205124/monk-class-color) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3424801326?page=2#26))<br>

Updating old Tier armor sets textures resolution<br>
We don&apos;t have any plans to tamper with the art of existing tier sets. Transmogrification is being implemented, in part, to allow nostalgic players the option of wearing old gear without having to worry about the stats anymore. But, we don&apos;t want to go back and actually alter those looks. That&apos;d almost defeat the purpose, especially given we&apos;d prefer to focus our time on designing new sets to allow for more customization options (including aesthetic, stat-less sets to be used solely for Transmogrification).<br>
<br>
The art and animation teams are incredibly busy, and sometimes I feel they don&apos;t get enough credit for the amount of work they do, or how much work is involved in each project. There are a number of projects on their list -- many of which players would love to see progress on -- but this isn&apos;t currently one of them that I&apos;m aware of.
