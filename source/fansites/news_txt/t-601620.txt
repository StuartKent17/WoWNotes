Boubouille2007-07-31, 07:49 PMYeah, another confirmation, I guess it was a good day to release the information. 

Usk.de http://www.usk.de/65_Aktuell_geprueft.htm same as ESRB/PEGI in Germany have a page up with the ratings of upcoming games ... Oh, look at the list ! There is a name we already know !

Update : The "GC" part is probably related to the Games Convention http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_Convention in Leipzig, held from 23 to 26/08. Thanks to Fisker, he's smart. Or maybe they're planning to release WoW on Gamecube *cough*, but personally I'd go for the Games Convention theory. 

Update 2 : Huh ... The Gamecube thing was a joke ... A tauren wouldn't fit in such a small box anyway.
