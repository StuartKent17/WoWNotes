Some interrupts were still incorrectly missing targets. Wind Shear, Spell Lock, Counterspell, Mind Freeze, and hunter pet abilities Nether Shock and Serenity Dust should no longer miss.<br>

<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=.9uf.priest) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1123-Priest-Cataclysm))<br>
<br>
Divine Aegis will no longer produce a shield if the full heal that should cause it is absorbed by a death knight&#x2019;s Necrotic Strike.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br>
<br>
The Satchel of Exotic Mysteries given to the member(s) of a class role eligible for Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms rewards now has an increased chance of containing a non-combat pet.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Bastion of Twilight<br>
<br>
The timing between Corrupted Adherent Summons and Cho&apos;gall Fury is consistent with its behavior prior to 4.1.<br>
<br>
<br>
Blackwing Descent<br>
<br>
Maloriak no longer interrupts his own casts of Arcane Storm by moving mid-cast.<br>
Nefarian will no longer stutter step toward his main target.<br>
<br>
<br>
Zul&#x2019;Aman<br>
<br>
All non-elite creatures which respawn quickly no longer award loot, reputation, or experience.<br>
Akil&#x2019;zon will summon Amani Kidnappers less frequently, but their health has been increased.<br>
<br>
<br>
Zul&#x2019;Gurub<br>
<br>
All non-elite creatures which respawn quickly no longer award loot, reputation, or experience.<br>

Ohgan will no longer fail to target and kill Chained Spirits if he is stunned at certain times.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guilds<br>
<br>
Guilds close to level 25 should correctly receive the realm-first achievement (when applicable), regardless of whether or not contributing members recently transferred to the realm.<br>

Items<br>
<br>
Players are no longer able to purchase any of the city reputation satchels without having the required reputation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Professions<br>
Engineering<br>
<br>
Nitro Boosts now do 80% of the engineer&#x2019;s health in damage over 8 seconds when they fail due to a Rocket Fuel Leak, down from 120%.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quests &amp; Creatures<br>
<br>
NPCs should be a little less talkative when interacted with. They were saying their lines on virtually every interaction (buying, selling, etc.).<br>
<br>
<br>
Mount Hyjal<br>
<br>
Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem is no longer incorrectly visible at the Shrine of Malorne after players complete the quest Firefight while on the quest Aessina&apos;s Miracle.<br>

<br>
