The season 4 item lists are now fully translated in German and French, I can't promise I'll do that everytime there is a major feature added to the game because it takes a tremendeous amount of time, but I guess it will make a few people happy.

The remaining parts of each parts of each post will be translated later today, any help on the german version would be greatly appreciated.

The9 Manually Set Chinese Realms' Isle of Quel'Danas Progress Via WoWinsider http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/05/02/wow-china-gets-all-access-pass-in-queldanas/
"The9, the company that operates World of Warcraft in China has announced today that all Chinese realms will have their Isle of Quel'danas progress manually set to be fully completed, since "all players have contributed as they should to the world event". They also apologized for the server problems players experienced these past few weeks, while wishing everyone a happy Mayday a four-and-a-half day holiday this year in China.

This rather drastic measure comes amidst widespread player complaints of their servers' poor performance after patch 2.4. Many of the more populous realms suffered frequent restarts and periods of downtime, especially at peak hours. As a result, a significant number of these realms also fell victim to rollbacks. Some of the hardest hit realms had their IQD progress reset multiple times in a single day."
