compstompNew Brawl - Comp Stomp
In addition to the visual updates, a new brawl is coming that pits players against the smart AI from Island Expeditions in Arathi Basin!
Head into Arathi Basin for a head-to-head battle against AI opponents. This new Brawl will be available March 20. Use the Group Finder tool hotkey “I” in the Player vs. Player tab to take part.


hatiHati Returns with New Customization
Hunters will be reuniting with their favorite wolf from Legion in Patch 8.1.5. On top of this, Hati is receiving a plethora of different customization items!


Level 120 hunters can start the quest chain by heading to their BfA faction hub and talking to the Image of Mimiron.
You can do the quest on any spec, but Hati is only usable by Beast Master hunters.
The quest involves you working with Mirmiron, Grif Wildheart, and Thorim to reconnect with Hati's essence. You will travel to locations such as Storm Peaks, Siluthus, and Ulduar.
Once completed, you will be able to tame 6 different variations of Hati the original 5 models from Legion and one new color
The PTR did not limit you on which models you could tame based on what you unlocked in Legion, so it seems that any hunter who completes the quest gets access to all of them.
After completing the quest, you also have access to certain items that benefit Hati, such as making him into a mount!

cycleCycle of Life Tortollan Quest
An interesting new world quest has been added to the Tortollan lineup called the Cycle of Life. 


It takes place with Scrollsage Nola https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/134344-scrollsage-nola and can spawn anywhere that the baby turtle quest Beachhead resides.
This quest is very different from helping baby turtles to the water. Upon reaching it, Nola will tell you "These tiny crabs need help! I hate to see any living things suffer. Would you be willing to lend a hand?"
You then take control of a crab and must move left or right in order to block baby turtles from reaching the water whilst avoiding the orb attacks from Scroll of Blasting https://www.wowdb.com/spells/292149-scroll-of-blasting.
After blocking a baby turtle, its shell will appear on your head and you can use Throw Turtle Shell https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/292287-throw-turtle-shell to take out any baby turtles in a line up the beach.
The quest ends when you block 20 baby turtles from the water. Nola exclaims "All creatures in nature must live together in balance. But I can't help cheering for the little turtles!"

Darkmoon Faire Severed Fish Heads
Vanion http://www.vanion.eu/news/patch-8-1-5-witzige-fische-auf-dem-dunkelmond-jahrmarkt-19841 discovered that Severed Fish Heads can be fished up from the waters around the Darkmoon Faire. There are two types of fish heads, Severed Crimsonscale Head https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/164972-severed-crimsonscale-head and Severed Azurefin Head https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/164973-severed-azurefin-head. They last for one day in your bags and when clicked provide a 60 minute buff that places the fish head on your character!

The tooltip reads "Something strange is happening in the waters surrounding Darkmoon Island..." perhaps hinting at the speculated relationship between the Darkmoon Faire and Old Gods. In the Warbringers: Azshara cinematic https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7924-Warbringers-Azshara?page=8, N'zoth first appears to Azshara as a fish.
