Boubouille2008-06-18, 06:37 PM2.4.3 PTR is coming soon
Stay tuned on MMO-Champion for the upcoming patch notes and changes. We're not sure about what's in this patch and it's still unsure if it will be a bug fix patch or if it will include more changes, this is probably the last patch before WotLK and Blizzard might have a few surprises in it. 
Yes the 2.4.3 PTR is coming soon. The forums were opened a little early and I would appreciate it if nobody spammed it before the realms are up.

I would advise anyone who is going to particiapte in the 2.4.3 PTR to delete their old WOWtest folder now so that you have no problems with the new install.
