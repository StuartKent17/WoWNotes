Patch 6.2.3 PTR - Build 20726
There was another PTR build tonight that was flagged as Release, no major changes from the previous one. We got the PvP Season ending warning http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4370-PvP-Season-15-Ending-Soon a few weeks ago, so it should be going live soon!

Blizzcon - Legion Developer Interview
Final Boss https://www.youtube.com/user/finalbosswow/videos had the opportunity to talk to Lead Game Designer Luis Barriga at Blizzcon.


<iframe width="900" height="100" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qpAYPI-g75g?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


The UI has been updated with new health bars. Example http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/november/legNameplate.jpg from Vanion's stream
All of the new things that made Warlords leveling great will be a part of Legion leveling in one form or another.
The team has spaced out the cinematics during leveling differently this time, rather than just doing one cinematic at the end of each zone.
Alliance get a Genn Greymane quest line and Horde get a Sylvanas quest line in Stormheim. 
In Warlords, if you skipped the rares while leveling you would go back to find they were no longer a challenge and no longer had relevant rewards. In Legion they will scale with your level, so you can go back and kill them for a challenge and better reward.
The team hears the requests for Stormwind Park repairs, but no comments on it for now. "You never know, you ask for something long enough and you never know what will happen"
The main-hand and off-hands for the Artifact weapons will change their look together, you can't pick and choose each individually. There is only one icon for these items, you click it and both main-hand and off-hand are filled. The technology is there to be used elsewhere if needed after Artifacts.
The team touched up the melee animations for Legion, so some of the clipping issues may have been resolved. In some poses the largest models may still have clipping issues.
Rogues got new finisher animations, Warriors got a new Mortal Strike animation, swipes and effects also were updated.
The team is investigating showing weapons somehow for bear form Druids. They aren't sure if it can be done, but they will get customization to their bear form when they have the Artifact equipped.
Multistrike causing two melee ability animations to go off was slightly problematic, as it would be more noticeable if you very quickly did two Moral Strikes. 
All classes have multiple legendary items, with some being specific to a class, spec, or role and some being more universal. 
If any, very few of the legendary items are BoE, they should be BoP. The intention is to create really awesome reward moments, not something to buy.

Now that the class blogs are done we can take a look at all of the feedback so far from the developers!

will Blood DKs get some on demand AoE for getting threat on more targets if DnD is on CD?
Blood still has access to Blood Boil for spreading diseases and generating threat. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664205046213537792

Cons spammable to be always up, D&D for 10s every 30s? I feel like we need better cleave. Like a Heart Strike talent.
Crimson Scourge will help with your AOE capabilities. Plus, there is just such a talent. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664239246056665088

Blood DK Bone Shield is a buff w/ charges that players need to watch. Removed from most specs due to UI, why is Blood exempt?
Bone Shield charges will also display on the Marrowrend icon. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664213229795610628
do bone shield still have an internal cooldown for triggering charges?
Yes, still one second. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664240830324957184

Why wouldn't DKs ignore the new Killing Machine? From the article, would be ignored by design; Obliterate randomly crits more.
It's still possible to overwrite waste Killing Machine procs if you don't use them before the next proc. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664214289029304320

Any chance Killing Machine devaluing crit will be addressed?
Different stats having different values isn't bad, as long as they're not terrible. Either way, yes, several talents affect this. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664215614479687681

As a noob DK, dw frost rotation has seemed unintuitive. If I should only use Oblit with KM, force it as unusable outside it?
Obliterate will be useful both with and without Killing Machine. You'll still want to minimize wasted KM procs, though. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664234640861859840

Just for clarification KM only affects obliterate now and not frost strike? not a typo?
Correct, not a typo. However, it may be modified by talents. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664238681385889792

clarification... Does legion outbreak apply diseases every 1 second for 6 seconds in an aoe?
Yes. The target pulses the disease application every second for 6 seconds. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664234409533403137

Would 1 Scourge Strike pop all the Festering Wounds on your target? Like, is the plan FS, FS, FS, SS or is it FS, SS, SS, SS?
Scourge Strike triggers only one Festering Wound at a time. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664205413663924224

Clarify Frost Fever? You have a chance to get a 30 sec buff? A chance to get RP on tick?
Each time Frost Fever deals damage, the Death Knight has a chance to gain Runic Power. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664205633223155712

I like the DK preview but I am concerned about the Frost rotation. It is VERY simple. Is additional rotational depth coming?
Baseline classes in Legion lean a little simpler, so that we can add a wide array of complexity via talents. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664213686186176516

Is it safe to assume that Death and decay and Defile are gone for frost dk's in place of remorseless winter for an AOE CD?
Yes, Frost DKs will have Remorseless Winter for AoE, along with a few potential talents. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664215226301059072

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid
Do Druids lose access to forms not associated with their spec or affinity or does everyone keep cat, bear, etc?
You still keep access to the forms, but have very few or no abilities in the ones you don't have an Affinity for. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664619407264497664

How will Druid affinities work with the Artifact weapons? Will there be some kind of automatic conversion to support it?
No, Artifacts remain spec-specific. You won't need to swap weapons to use your Affinity. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664892114199830528

The way I am reading it, seems like the affinity passives maybe built into their base specs?
Correct. Every Druid spec has the benefit from it's associated Affinity built in. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664877962571874304

Puns aside, is hurricane still in game and useful?
Hurricane is currently planned to be an AoE damage ability for Restoration only. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664616983996923904

Does Starsurge give you one of each empowerment or just one empowerment that effects both spells?
One charge of each Empowerment. You'll want to use one Lunar Strike and one Solar Wrath to spend both of them. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664620247542988801

I think you have a typo on star surge preview . As awesome as Astral damage sounds don't you mean arcane damage?
Nope. The combination of Nature and Arcane schools formerly called Spellstorm is now called Astral. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664623247657299970

With starfall being targeted now, what is the range on the area we select?
We're still tuning it, but it's intended to be very large. Something like a 15 yard radius over 3.5x the area of Blizzard. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664617583765667840
There's also a pretty fun talent that makes it 30% larger still, and allows you to cast while moving while inside it. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664617664283742208

Do Balance Druids still use mana? They don't have mana costs listed in their section of the overview.
Balance Druids have a secondary mana bar that they only use outside of form, similar to Feral. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664618997640335360

If I'm playing Feral w/ guardian affinity, could I perform a 3rd tank role in encounters using a 3-tank strategy?
The intention is that any Druid with Guardian Affinity can tank something, as long as it's not overly hard-hitting. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664901891986317312

Are ferals supposed to be swapping to Moonkin after they dump energy to cast while regening energy in Legion?
The version of Moonkin Form granted by Balance Affinity will have a cooldown to prevent using it rotationally. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664620691556204544

What is the reasoning behind keeping feral automatic stealthed rake stun in PvP? It makes for uninteresting gameplay.
Incarnation no longer affects Rake in Legion. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664888570499346432

Is there any further information to share on how Rage generation will work for Guardians? Only Mangle identified in the blog.
Auto-attacks are still the most significant source of Rage for Guardians. When we get to tuning, we'll see if more is needed. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664904060957360128

Where iz Maul? How can bare Maul face if bare can no Maul?
Maul is only used to turn excess Rage into damage when not tanking, so it wasn't listed in the blog. It's still available. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664618728898756608

For the record, Ironfur stacks. It doesn't mean the duration increases, it means that for each charge used consecutively it goes up by 100%
It *overlaps*, which is slightly different. You gain and lose each stack individually. It doesn't just grow indefinitely. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664616834142879744

Will harmony count towards spells activating it e.g. reju buffs itself, or is it just a buff towards different spells?
A HoT will count itself for purposes of Harmony. A lone Rejuvenation will get 1x benefit from mastery. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664619818645979136

Resto Druid Harmony applies to all healing done by the druid, including Tranq? Rejuv have regular GCD?
All of these guesses are correct! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664619170340864000

The return of Thorns was mentioned at Blizzcon, but I don't see it here?
Restoration has Thorns as a tool to increase damage while soloing. Not all abilities are covered in the blog. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664619627545128960

re: new Druid Mastery "10% per HoT" is that unique HoTs like Regrowth+Rejuv or Germination style Rejuv x2? What is max %? 50?
It counts all active HoTs. Currently, there is no cap. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664620433195429888

will the first Rejuv update its current HoT value each additional HoT that comes down, or will we have to recast once fully HoTed?
It updates dynamically for all HoTs. No snapshotting. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664877708136939520

is Tranquility gone or a talent?
Neither. Tranquility is still present and generally similar to its current form. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664619999290527749

#Hunters: it's that time again! What pet families would you like to see added in #Legion? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/663825903122649088

are you able to say if MM hunters can still summon a pet at all in legion? I like being petless but pet tank is convenient
They currently have a "Dark Ranger" talent which has a chance to summon an undead minion. That minion can also tank. https://t.co/6eNFhbcFBx WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664167776672575489

Hey is there any way hunters can keep black arrow? Give it to marksman perhaps
Yes! The current plan is for Black Arrow and Lock and Load to become Marksmanship-specific talents. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663790971121872896

is aimed shot still able to be cast on the move?
No, but that's partially offset by its faster cast time, less frequent use, and the return of Arcane Shot. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663793058417283073

my only concern is how punishing survival might be when losing the mongoose bite buff
Mongoose stacks aren't something you maintain. Their stacking encourages you to pool them, then use as many as you can. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663793828936024064

Still trying to figure out how they want Mongoose Bite to be used. How can you get 6 stacks in 3.5s with the GCD?
The duration is refreshed with each use. You'll want to alternate Mongoose Bite and other abilities, to proc more Mongoose charges WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663811115424415744

flanking strike is basically kill command? Love everything else, that caught me up a little
That tooltip was slightly outdated. Flanking Strike causes you and your pet to attack at the same time. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663794051448094720

What % is Surv expected to be in melee? 80? 100? New melee class?
Survival is going to be a 100% legit melee spec. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/663820352917630976

For BM, are you planning on keeping BW as is? And does the 15s off BW CD from DB reduce by a further 15s every time used?
Bestial Wrath is largely unchanged. Each time you use Dire Beast, the remaining cooldown on BW is reduced. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664161954169163776

If mastery increases your maximum mana, but spells still use X% of your mana, mages aren't gaining anything, clarity please?
Spell costs are a % of BASE mana. The costs don't increase with Mastery. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663862185823596544

Frost mage: Will we still have Icy Veins and will it give Haste ?
Yep, and yep. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663860536015085568

Is Frostfire Bolt gone? Very valuable in PvP. Sad to see Icicles sticking around, really don't like it. Shatter mastery pls.
For those who dislike Icicles, we currently have a talent planned that will replace them with a new active ability. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663862428799598592

Is Ice Nova for frost mages being removed with Legion?
We recognize the issues that the Nova talents have caused, especially in PvP. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664164407266533376
We're planning to test out an alternate design where they don't replace Frost Nova, but only have 1 charge. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664164470386638849

can you elaborate on Flamestrike vs Pyro last on Hot Streak proc. How does Flamestrike work in #Legion
Flamestrike remains similar, though it has a longer cast time and much more damage. Alternative AoE use for Hot Streaks. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664160093324251136

Concerning the fire changes, what about spreading Living Bomb/Pyro DoT? I loved seeing groups of mobs explode =
Hot Streaked Pyroblasts and Flamestrikes create a larger Ignite, instead of their own DoT. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663859300574457860
Ignite spreads on its own, and Living Bomb is spreadable via Inferno Blast. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663859358644568064
will it ignore CCed targets like Starfall?
The current plan is that Ignite will not automatically spread to crowd controlled targets. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664166358519689216

When it says ignite "may" spread to nearby targets, what does that actually mean?
Every 2 sec., one of your Ignites chosen at random will spread to a random other target within 5yd that has a weaker/no ignite. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663862845646356480
'One of your ignites' - are they not all rolled into one any more?
They are still rolled into one on each target. You may have Ignite on multiple targets, though. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664169702223032320
will mastery % affect the chance that it will spread?
A random Ignite will spread every 2 seconds. No further chances. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664168139916115968
Clarification on the mastery chance to spread ignite. I feel like we won't have any control over our dot spreading 
Curious what control you're looking for? It just spreading quickly and constantly seems almost purely better, no? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/664190068983099392
Update to this, based on feedback: every 2 sec, *each* of your Ignites will spread. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664240460743839744

Really wondering why Brewmaster's artifact doesn't come with a keg? Even if it wasn't an artifact persay. It looks really
It actually does! We're working to tie the Brewmaster staff including the keg into their combat animations. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664904262720208896

With Guard gone, what will Brewmasters use to mitigate magic damage?
Stagger now works against magic damage at 50% effectiveness. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664549395539492864

Does Expel Harm still exists for Brewmasters? I kind of liked it.
The gameplay from Expel Harm was merged into a new, stronger version of Gift of the Ox. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664555225416511488

Elusive Brew is also better as an active ability. That dodge mastery is very unappealing. Can't stagger improve with mastery?
It's important to note that the Elusive Brawler mastery effect can stack, making it extremely reliable. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664552946500157440

what's the usefulness of energy for brews now? Cooldowns and huge energy costs on tiger palm and keg smash?
Tiger Palm is actually 25 Energy for Brewmasters, 50 for Windwalker. That's a mistake in the blog, and will be fixed shortly! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664574902192570368

with these changes, I feel you're making us even slower than we already are. Please don't take our identity.
Could you clarify what you're talking about? What suggests to you that it's somehow slower? Would like to help clarify it. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/664550400087846912
Tigers Palm costs more energy. What about doing it the other way around? Incorporate TP on jab, since Jab is more iconic
OK. The rotation is faster, not slower, but you got the impression that it was based on the TP cost. Good to know, thanks! Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/664559126857408512
But, regarding my second question, don't you think jab is more iconic? TP doesn't even have that much of visual effect...
Could you double-check that? I think you might be mixing them up. Jab has virtually no visual on live, TP has a strong iconic. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/664560155250458624

Chi-Ji is my favorite Celestial; I hope there are plans to bring back a Crane theme for Monks in the future?

Jab and Tiger Palm were effectively merged. There is no more Tiger Power. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664551136947363840

will WW end up sitting and waiting for CDs to avoid using the same ability twice?
Windwalker's GCDs are fairly filled; relatively little time waiting around. Mastery favors ordering your abilities well. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664552441094893569

MW mastery seems like a cheap copy of Versatility and very boring. Seems very similar to all other healer masteries except disc.
It's actually fairly different from other healer masteries: it's a flat amount, not a percentage. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664550481574785024

Does the new soothing mist have a cast bar? Can it be interrupted?
Soothing Mist has a channel bar, but no duration. We're considering multiple options for how interrupts affect it. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664550661967605760
Currently, we're trying it beeing uninterruptible. We may also try having it interruptible, but on the Physical school. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664550874799173632
Lastly, can I move while soothing mist is active?
There's a talent which will allow you to do just that! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664555043916374016

Why cast Effuse? Cast a bigger heal like Renewing and just let the passives do the maintenance healing over time. Same HPM.
Effuse is a fast and cheap way to start Soothing on a target. It's the Monk's answer to spells like the Priest's "Heal." WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664558500530405376

Is the statue gone for mistweavers? and how will they be able to level as healers with fistweaving removed?
There is a talent that brings back the Statue for players who miss it. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664558620319739904

2 Mistweaver questions: still melee? and is mana tea still around?
Mana Tea is no longer present in its current form, but there is a new variant of it in talents. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664558753971220481

Does this mean Mistweavers will no longer be immune to ranged mechanics? No longer considered melee?
Correct. Mistweavers will now be treated like other ranged specs for the purpose of encounter ability targeting. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664553138653802496

Mistweaver clarifications: Movement will interrupt soothing mists? When Renewing mist "travels" is it removed from 1st target?
When Renewing Mist overheals, it leaves the overhealed target, and moves to a new target. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664555861335937024

love the new mistweavers kit. Any chance there's a talent to make essence font like rjw, cast other things while using it?
The channel on Essence Font is there to help balance its large amount of total healing. At 3 seconds, it's still quite flexible. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664558046723489792

With FW gone for MW what damaging abilities do we have for "solo questing outdoors"? Not mad crane is rip,just wondering.
Mistweaver will still have melee abilities for dealing damage, they're just not dual-purposed into providing smart heals. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664616434039848960
In a world where healers are to do more damage in the down time during bosses, how are we to do that at range?
During an encounter where you can't be in melee, Crackling Jade Lightning makes a good fallback. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664890080889204736

does haste will continue to lower CDs and GCD?
Yes, Haste continues to lower GCDs and the CDs of rotational abilities, same as before. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664164961355087872

if Holy paladins have only cast time heals, how are they supposed to move and cast to be near targets?
Check out Light of the Martyr. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/663968900724318209

Is Mastery: Lightbringer Linear with distance or some other shape?
It's generally linear, but there is a minimum radius in which you will always receive 100% benefit. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664158567792902144

Does Lightbringer heal the tank through the Beacon if you have Beacon of the Lightbringer?
Lightbringer affects your direct heal already, so it doesn't affect the Beacon transfer again. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664524984824430592
So if I heal the tank who has Beacon he won't get any benefit from Lightbringer unless I'm stood next to the tank?
If you have Beacon of the Lightbringer and cast directly onto your Beacon, it will get 100% mastery benefit. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664557647035658240

How will HPal mast affect Beacon? Will Beacon xfer 50% of total heal or will it be lowered by being further away
The Beacon will transfer 50% of the total heal, regardless of where the Beacon target is standing. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664902063852122112

Hey any chance my holy pally can get some damage in, I always enjoyed hitting a crusader strike for an hp, or melee for mana
We don't want to force Holy Paladins into attacking as part of their rotation, but talents can add that gameplay by choice. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664158827814653952

Will we see changes to holy pal. mobility to complement the requirement for proximity & thus more movement? Cant run & cast.
We added an extremely strong spell for Holy Paladin mobility. Check out Light of the Martyr. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664159750976765952


the new ret paladin rotation seems to possibly have a lot of downtime. Will other spells and talents play a part as well?
Absolutely. The baseline rotation has a fair bit of room in it, because talents fill quite a few GCDs. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664904450629201921

will Retribution still have Hammer of Wrath?
Hammer of Wrath has been removed in order to improve class/spec distinction. 1/3 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664160402041769984
Warriors are intended to be the kings of the Execute mechanic, and others had crept too far into that territory. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664160478323601408
However, for those who may miss throwing Hammers, there's a snazzy new visual on Judgment that may interest you! 3/3 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664160593876652032

What's that Hand of Hindrance that being replaced by some talent?
A new snare ability for Retribution. Stay tuned for details. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664163828037324800
well but that way we still have to stare at charges, now its just at the bottom half of the screen instead of the top, right ?
We feel that's a pretty important distinction. You're already watching your action bars for ability cooldowns/usability. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664238091578683392

while i love the ability, Lothar was a warrior. maybe consider calling it Turalyon's might instead of Lothar?
Indeed, you are quite correct! We'll adjust the name. Thanks! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664166801702412288

Does Light of the Protector have charges? Wording on Redoubt indicates yes, but if so how many?
That was a typo. We'll get it fixed. Earlier in development, Light of the Protector shared charges with Shield of the Righteous. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664159079917469696

Chance of prot pally getting a baseline 1s GCD? No Holy Power makes Haste unattractive, and game play as a whole much slower.
Haste will reduce Shield of the Righteous recharge time and Light of the Protector cooldown, similar to other rotation abilities. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664159568893624320

So... if mana doesn't matter for Protection paladins and they're losing holy power... what *is* the resource they're managing?
Charges of Shield of the Righteous fill the same role, with more flexibility. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664163091202969600

was Guardian of Ancient Kings removed?
No, the blog just lists core combat abilities. Guardian may be tweaked slightly, but maintains the same purpose. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664163324469227520

The current plan is for Holy Nova to be Holy's method of dealing AoE damage. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663808503023144960

Will Holy Priest have an AoE damage spell, since Mind Sear is now out? Holy Nova seems like the obvious solution
The current plan is to remove Weakened Soul. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663812757372858368
Holy Nova is, in fact, the current plan! All healers will have some capacity to damage multiple targets. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663813220755345408

Love the Holy Priest redesign. Hope for fun smiting talents to go with it. Does Holy Word: Sanctify replace Circle of Healing?
We're currently considering talent options that bring back Circle of Healing, or something similar. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663809364164128768

Just reading priest blog and unless im mistaken PoH group restriction appears gone. Is that so  *crosses fingers* 
Indeed! We're trying a different targeting method for Prayer of Healing, which makes it more localized instead of group-based. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663809936170725376

Any news on PoH being "closest 5 targets" like WG?, making efficient PoH groups isn't fun and should be fixed.
In #Legion, Prayer of Healing will choose allies within a radius instead of being group-based. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664901576079765505

"for an absolutely massive amount". #winning
A crit Holy Word: Serenity is basically a full heal. We think that qualifies as "absolutely massive." WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663811458417844224

Will Holy Word: Serenity still apply a crit buff, as it does currently?
No. The spell is now entirely focused into being a very large instant heal. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663883520461242368

there is no mention of Divine Aegis in the priest blog, is it going to be gone?
Yes. The number of absorbs especially passive ones, such as Divine Aegis and Illuminated Healing is being heavily reduced. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663883852419493888

penance damage only?Remove pom cast, it is only used as purge protection atm
Talents will offer some potential alterations to Penance. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664166601751556096

Bit of conflicting info. Darkmoon Faire Q&A made it sound like Disc. was losing PW:S, blog shows it as a spell. Is it staying?
Discipline still has Power Word: Shield, but it will have a 6-second cooldown, to reduce spamminess. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663806445045977088

It just seems weird that DIsc, which was never really about DPS healing, has pivoted to it, while MW, which was, is cutting it
That's definitely fair. There are many reasons, but a big one is that Priests have another spec if you don't like DPS->Heal. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664549867528712192
Chadd, how long is the atonement buff supposed to be?
Currently 15 seconds, with a talent available to extend that to 20 seconds. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663808145727197184

How will Atonement work when enemies have damage taken up or down buffs?
Atonement healing should not be affected by those. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664175563431501825

is atonement a buff that gets renewed or extended? for example, casting plea 2x in a row on same target = 15 sec or 30?
It gets renewed. We're considering having it behave similar to DoT effects, which have some leeway on when you refresh. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663812583263105024

will solo healing 5-mans be inherently more difficult for discipline due to the changes in legion?
We'll be making sure that Discipline is still able to heal dungeons comfortably. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663810111614283776

Disc's 70/30 - how will healing be competitive without damage being significant. Guaranteed Disc raid spot still exists?
Those were just off-the-cuff examples. Goal is that they provide respectable damage and healing, and we'll iterate as necessary. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663860351495069696

So how viable will leveling as Discipline be in Legion? I love Disc and don't want to go away from it to even level.
The goal is for healing specs to be fully viable for solo questing outdoors. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663884048868085760

In Legion, will Shadow Mend overhealing still trigger the DoT? Basically, is it possible for it to be a net loss?
Nope! Only the effective healing will turn into a DoT. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663810373506592769

How does Void Form's Haste Buff work if i enter Void Form instantly via Oblivion? Reset, Stack further, new Stack?
When Voidform ends, you get a buff that provides the Haste from that Voidform for 20 sec. It stacks with the next Voidform. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664241222530150400

unclear in the blog: is insanity capped at 100, is void form toggleable?
Yes, Insanity is capped at 100. Voidform is automatically activated, not toggled. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663807287723585536

On the usefulllessness of the Mastery Insanity Generation Increase: https://t.co/pUITMTMPyB
Voidform doesn't stop your abilities from generating Insanity. Mastery will allow you to maintain Voidform longer/stronger. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663863099124879360

I WILL HEAL YOU TO DEATH! GLORY TO CTHULU, FTHAGN RY'LEH!
Sounds like you may enjoy the fact that you're forced to speak Shath'yar - the language of the Old Gods - while in Voidform. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663807800783450112

I hope that Shadow talents will contain several options to control Insanity When you enter, leave early, stay in longer, etc.
Anything can change, but we currently have 8 different talents that relate to Insanity. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663808897396793344

Was just curious about how fast the drain is-it will always be greater, at least to some degree, than our ability to generate?
At first, the Voidform drain is slower than you can generate Insanity, but it ramps up over time, draining faster and faster. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663859967351353344

Insanity shares some of the pre-WoD eclipse problem. Idea: Remove damage buff, make it about max. DoT extension/Haste Buff.
You'll be able to return to Voidform very quickly, thanks to the Haste from your previous Voidform persisting for 20 seconds. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663809607526035456

What happenes with Vendetta ?
The blog focused on rotational abilities. Vendetta, Adrenaline Rush, and Shadow Blades are burst CDs for each spec, respectively WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664886073466597376

Loved the rogue preview but... Anticipation: baseline please?
Anticipation remains a talent. However, it has some serious competition on its talent row now. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664888261958086661

Pretty disappointed Assa still isn't active poisoning. And no thrown poison vial? Outlaw losing PvP stun/silence from stealth?
Assassination does have an ability that throws a poisoned dagger, applying your poison at range. It's just not in the blog. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664889207454732289

At the start of legion as assassination a rogue will have 18.3 energy/sec. For comparison in wrath AR only brought combat to ~22 energy/sec.
There's still a lot of tuning to be done. Venomous Wounds will be tuned so that pooling is still important. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664885009963024384

Does Venomous Wounds still do damage on proc or just energy regen?
Just energy regen. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664887881089966080

Please, tell me that Co-..Outlaw rogues instead of throw will have shoot vial their pistol! Please !! :D
Indeed. Pistol Shot provides a ranged snare and minor damage which is heavily increased with the proc from Saber Slash. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664888854994771968

.pistol shot'll let me damage & gain combo points from range. Awesome! Will there be a ranged finisher? https://t.co/ItGcPGx5ys
Yes! Instead of Kidney Shot, Outlaws have a pistol-based finisher which deals damage and stuns from range. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664890443516112896

Why is it called Shadowstrike and not Ghostly Strike?
Because Ghostly Strike is a talent for Outlaws! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664887673635520512

Is Hemorrhage still a thing for Sub Rogues?
We may keep it in some form, possibly as a talent. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664886238147514368

. With substantial changes to the Sub Rogue’s Stealth uptime, should we expect to see Find Weakness in #Legion?
With the new Shadow Dance design, Find Weakness no longer makes sense, so it has been removed. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664887374753624065

Does Shadowstrike have a cooldown?
Nope! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664889006845374464

Shadowstepping on every Shadowstrike seems dangerous in PvE. Will there be a way to lessen our need to be in a backstab zone?
Shadowstrike will not teleport you if you are already in melee range. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664889901909831680

You know... quickly teleport behind enemy, stab in back, teleport back to original position.
When you use Backstab, it's likely just after you used Shadowstrike, which did just that. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/664894786634051584

No, Maelstrom generation does not increase on critical strikes. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664525521850531841

It seems implied from the blog, but is Fulmination is entirely gone as it stands?
Not as "Fulmination", but the mechanic still exists through building up high Maelstrom and spending it using Earth Shock. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664251191405096961

Overload's 75% damage & Maelstrom generation means LB Overloads = 11.25 Maelstrom generated?

Enhancement has a new frontal-cone AoE spell called Crash Lightning, which also causes Stormstrike and Lava Lash to trigger AoEs. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664255783165521921

Any details on the negative effects on Enhance shamans that hit Maelstrom cap?"They must be careful not to let it overflow"
That line is simply referring to the potential to accidentally waste it by overflowing. No other negative effects. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664257447591215104

I don't see it mentioned, but is Searing Totem still a core part of Enhancement Shamans "maintenance" buffs or was it removed?
Searing Totem wasn't really providing compelling gameplay, so it's been removed in Legion. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664259393999900673

Will Enhance have a way to pull targets at range? No 30 yard reach on lightning bolt now

Yes, Windfury attacks will trigger Maelstrom Weapon. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664253180885143552

Rockbiter without a cooldown? Just curious.
Correct, there is no cooldown on Rockbiter. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664253307246895104

Windfury seems to be losing it's significance. With no Maelstrom and minor damage, it feels just there for legacy.

Healing Surge will cost Maelstrom for both Elemental and Enhancement. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664255286618664960

Can you go into depth about how you are shifting Resto to more targeted heals instead of Chain Heal spam?
Mostly by simply making the direct heals more competitive, but also by ensuring mana remains relevant throughout the expansion. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664251927568363520

Green Fire is staying. Don't worry. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664170099209732096

How do Warlocks regen Mana in Legion? Life Tap? Stuff like the initial Affliction Artifact Talent? Both?
Yes, all Warlocks will use Life Tap in Legion. https://t.co/ZzLiqdvjKE WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664173479088947200

Warlocks look great. Concerns for spec loyalty being a goal tho. It will take some AOE talents for AFF to not get overshadowed 
There's a particularly interesting talent that makes Seed of Corruption apply as an AoE, but cost a soul shard. Pop pop pop! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664172658708185088

Is Affliction's Haunt ability gone? Also I'd like to hear more about Affli/Destro AoE.
Haunt is returning as a talent, with a slightly different design. Stay tuned for details. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664171422105796608

stuns they already had... So how effective is Drain Life really going to be,too much of a PvP liability
We're very conscious of this concern. The good thing is that we can add customization and tuning via Legion PvP systems. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664173954135797760

is there ANY justifiable reason to keep CB as shadow damage, not as chaos damage?
We'd actually be interested in hearing discussion on this, after clearing up a common misconception: 1/2 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664171008597753856
Chaos damage does NOT inherently bypass shields/immunity. Interrupting it would lock ALL schools. Still want that? 2/2 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664171117955842049

Single-Target Base SoulShard generation for Destro looks slow. 2 every 16 sec + low RNG on Immo. Talents for more?
Indeed, there are several talents that deal with Soul Shards. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664172837645651969

“buffs up to three of your active pets” does that mean that Demo can have multiple different demon types up?
It can affect your primary demon pet, Infernal or Doomguard, Grimoire of Service pets, Dreadstalkers, and Wild Imps. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664239857913495552

I'd prefer if all demons were buffed, so I don't have to track which are my most powerful 3 and when are they about to despawn.
Then you'll be quite interested in the Power Trip talent, which does exactly that! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664171640880627712

... most of the temporary demons are also alive only for 12 sec. What if I have a strong demon that's going to despawn in 2 sec?
Managing when to cast Demonic Empowerment will be a key part of mastering Demonology gameplay. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664171999011344384

Wheres FnB? I hope it's still here, because if not that new talent won't save the day for destruction.
Shadowburn is a talent, with improved usability. Fire and Brimstone is a talent that passively makes Incinerate AoE. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664172285025103872

Can you clarify the "limit 1" on Havoc's description? Limit 1 what?
You may only place Havoc on one target at a time. That matters when it's improved via talents. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664170344647815168

what does 'Your Destruction spells deal up to x% additional damage, randomly' mean? how does that work?
Mastery provides a damage bonus to those spells, but it's a random % increase, up to the very high Mastery % 1/2 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664173096178311168
The frequency of your attacks will quickly smooth out the RNG element, but it's always possible you might prefer other stats. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664173191552626688

On the warrior blog coming this week, will it be discussed why their artifacts were chosen to all be swords. No axes or hammers?
We went with swords for wider appeal, but there's a variant we haven't shown yet that you might like. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663887554484170752

Serious missed opportunity not giving arms warriors the forged by cenarius for Broxigar. If there was ever an expac...
Yeah, thought about doing that one for a long while. In the end, a wooden nature themed axe didn't feel right, despite lore. craig_amai https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/664186887876120577

really? this is what you bring to the table for warriors? you say they overpower their foes, yet take away overpower?
I think you may have read that backwards. Refer to the paragraphs about Warriors in general for some good news! Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/664485930632220672

The Arms Warrior talent "Titanic Might", the halving of effectiveness, does that work with the Mastery also?
Yes. Titanic Might effectively gives you a half-strength Colossus Smash with a 100% uptime. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664521391283109888

Makes sense. It would be nice to have as a Rage generator. Auto-attacks alone won't cut it, I fear.
Charge, autoattacks, and talents will provide plenty of Rage for Arms Warriors. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664525828089212929

Overpower and HS are talents, right? Are they spec specific? Do they work as they used to? Will either replace whirlwind? <3
Overpower and Heroic Strike are talents for Arms and Fury. They don't replace anything. Heroic Strike is baseline for Protection. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664527859130589184

Did I read correctly that Fury *takes* 30% more dmg while Enraged?
Correct. Being Enraged reduces your defenses. However, that's offset by a much higher max health, and very high self-healing. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664517318030954496
if you are one shotted it's useless more self healing
Does having 31% more max health not help with that? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/664556972734156800
We'll tune this as needed to ensure that Fury Warriors are not a liability. 30% may not be the correct number. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664517391661993984

I'm not seeing myself camping defensive stance just so I can survive when others are fine.
We will not expect Fury Warriors to swap to Defensive Stance whenever they expect to take damage. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664552754048708608

Is Rampage Fury Warr a channeled ability? Imo channeled abilities are boring.
Rampage is not channeled. You maintain full control during its animation, apart from being on GCD, like any other attack. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664521122482819072
So we'll be able to move? What about use other abilities during that 2 sec?
You can move and use off-GCD abilities, while you are on GCD. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/664557344995479552

Why doesn't Rampage just trigger Enrage? Take some emphasis off randomness of BT crit, which is a major concern. @Celestalon
Rampage always deals damage as though you're Enraged. You don't have to wait until Enrage to use it. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664558213157662720

By the artifact for Fury warriors it's not certain that they wield 2H weapons At least for me could we have more information
Fury's artifact is indeed a pair of 2-handed weapons. They looked a little small in the preview; we'll be scaling them up a bit. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664524346975649792

What gives fury warriors "much higher max health"?
A passive +25% bonus to max health, and Titan's Grip which roughly amounts to another 6%, typically. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664556235186814977
wait so you are adding 25% more health? on top of TG?
Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/664562248317186049
Warrior preview. Prot. Move heroic strike off gcd again and add small cooldown instead. Useless burner and choice otherwise 
Heroic Strike is still off of GCD. That hasn't changed. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664521618551537664

will ignore pain count as active mitigation? Currently for some reason shield barrier doesnt.
Yes, Ignore Pain is considered Active Mitigation. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664526342218579970

Plz clarify ignore pain "next massive damage". Buff consumed on next inc damage ? "Random aoe" can waste it ?
Ignore Pain ignores 90% of the next X damage you take, from any sources. It lasts until you take a total of X damage. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664520780227608576
what is the variable "x" in this situation?
It's 25% of your maximum health. So if you have 400k health, X = 100k. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664548682151268352
Example: Boss deals 50k, 25k, 50k. You take 5k X=50k left, 2.5k X=25k left, 27.5k affected first 25k, then fell off. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664548742989611008
So warriors are going to have incredibly smooth damage intake. Feeling underwhelmed by protadin announcement.
I'm trying to help clarify things as much as possible... Could you help me understand what led you to that conclusion? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/664553650102992897
Ignore Pain kicks in only on heavy damage attacks and reduces them significantly, effectively mitigating the largest damage 1/2
Ah, this is more fallout from the confusing wording of Ignore Pain then. No, that's not what it does. See blog and clarifications. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/664566818774712320
What I'm lacking understanding on is, if you take a 1mil hit and you have 400k hp, is 90% of 100k reduced or 90% of 1mil
90% of 100k. It will absorb 90% of the next 100k that you take. A 1mil hit will do 910k. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/664705585795854336

Tell my why I shouldn't stand in fire when I am not tanking as prot? It reminds me of vengeance, take damage to do more damage
Your DPS gain would be trivial, and your healers could do significantly more DPS in the time they spend healing you instead. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664526582443184128

Will shield slam and revenge be prot warrior's only way to generate rage, because the values seem kinda of low.

Fistweaving and Gladiator Stance
Fistweaving and Gladiator Stance will not be joining us in Legion.

We love the fantasy that each of those “subspecs” promise, but leaving them as subspecs has proven to be problematic, making us unable to properly deliver on their fantasy. Trying to support two different playstyles within one spec restricts how much we can focus and bring out the strengths of either of them. We still love both of their concepts, however, and will look for opportunities to bring them back in the future.

Fistweaving in particular ended up being used mostly as a mana management tool to support Serpent Stance, instead of a damage/heal hybrid, which didn’t support its fantasy well. While we recognize that the initial goal for Mistweaver Monk -- combining a ranged healer with a melee healing style -- attracted some people to the class, quite a few things have changed since then. Most importantly, there’s been a huge shift away from smart heals in Warlords, which is continuing in Legion.

Mistweaver gameplay for most players was centered around their ranged healing spells, and our focus for the spec in 7.0 consists of reinforcing their unique array of healing tools and adding talents and artifact powers that support this style.


Blue Tweets
Soon. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/664955269298806784

Classes
I like the general feel of the rotations, but what about the CCs? Are they being baked into Talents? PVP Prestige?
The blogs are only covering core combat abilities. There will still be baseline CC, and potentially more via talents and PvP. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663810663542734848

Hey guys, have you considered making mana scale again like it used to? And not a base amount that never changes?
We want to make sure that mana remains a meaningful constraint throughout the expansion. Gear is not likely to scale mana pools. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663811805299388416

For alts, will there be a way to just take all passive talents?
Nearly every talent row will have a passive option. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663815672447692800

With classes being reworked, will we have more abilities on our bars, less, or around the same amount?
For many specs, the answer will be "either less or more, depending on which talents you pick." WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663813566210797568

I'm curious why some times class consistency is good soul shards and other times its not holy power 
Great question! It's important that the resource itself has strong fantasy, and that it also brings strong gameplay. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664174427974709248

Roughly how many talent rows will we have access to in Legion, if I may ask?
7 rows, plus PvP talents. Also, the game has far more total talents due to having many more spec-specific options! https://t.co/N2k1N3qYRi WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664175352789401601

Character / Items
How are we already back at items with +1k points of a stat? That stat squish didn't seem to last a single expansion.
We would've been well into 5 digits by now otherwise. It was a temporary realignment, not a permanent end to scaling. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/663747574508077056

Super excited to see how Artifacts are coming along. Cannot wait to spew feedback during Beta -- Cap on Artifact per week?
There are some caps on spending deep in to prevent potential hard grinding. We'll have more details to share later. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/663887012940812289

Artifact transmog: will we be able to, eg. mog Icebringer different from Soulreaper? Sorry if already answered, haven't seen.
Yes, mainhand and offhand will remain separately transmogrifiable. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664174841310769152

Will artifacts be transmoggable between weapon types? ie fist weapons transmogged to maces?
You will be able to transmogrify your Artifact to look like a different weapon, following the normal transmog rules. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664175025071632384

Can you expand on alts getting artifacts? Will we be able to experience the story lore of all spec artifacts on one char?
Yep! You can do the artifact quest lines for all of a character's available specs. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664233772540235776

PvP
With the introduction of a PvP talent system, are the normal talents still active in PvP areas?
yes holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/664157763124068352

Any word on racials in PVP? I'm assuming they're removed in RBG and arena, because trinkets and enchants are removed.
Racials, Talents, Artifact Traits, and of course PvP talents will all be active in both unrated and rated PvP. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664175903707017216
this includes world pvp, right? And duels?
Yes, this includes world PvP and duels. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664246459622027264

Lore
Can I ask you a little lore question? What is the relation between mana, arcane and chi/life? Is mana any different from chi?
An upcoming book will detail these and other fundamental forces! Arcane is a fundamental power, "Mana" is just a measure of it. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/663772539613634560
"Chi" is a Pandaren term for "Spirit," the primal life force that shaman tap into. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/663772650519420929

Hi, . Like other Paladins, must Blood Knights have faith in the Light to use it, or CAN they just take it from the Sunwell? TY
technically they can take it but Liadrin has moved the blood knights away from that type of abuse of the Light. Abrosiabi https://twitter.com/Abrosiabi/status/663773073699540992

what about Illidan. You almost didn't say anything about him at the panels . What's his status? Is he hiding/plotting something
long storyline throughout whole expansion. Patience please Abrosiabi https://twitter.com/Abrosiabi/status/664125040456155136

Green dragons were immortal until the events of Cataclysm and the unmaking of Deathwing, as I understand it. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/661616723565514753
Slight error Mr. Kosak. All dragons were mortal before Cataclysm, just long lived. The Aspects, alone, were immortal
Yes! Thank you. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/664137098757148672

Hi, . Like other Paladins, must Blood Knights have faith in the Light to use it, or CAN they just take it from the Sunwell? TY
To wield the Light as a weapon takes intense focus and a VERY powerful belief. Power isn't stolen the way Warlocks take it DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/663775639275569153
What? That directly conflicts with the BK's origin of stealing power from M'uru, and the AskCDev answer about it.
Question was about present day and Sunwell. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/664142187966271488

Any chance the habit of locking big lore moments behind mythic raidng can stop? Lore nerds are not Raiders and vice versa usually
Well, by definition raid fights and their result HAVE to be important for lore. LFR is there to ensure everyone can see it! DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/664136252799651843
That said the Lore of Legion's Raids R making me 4 the first time want to seriously try Raids maybe I am contradicting myself lol

UI / Addons
Are there any plans on having a built-in option to track debuffs on nameplates without extra addons?
We're experimenting with ways to show some debuffs such as DoTs on nameplates. Beta feedback will be invaluable! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664215966557966338

A little confused on zone scaling in Legion. If lvl 102 and lvl 108 players group together, what do mobs scale to?
The way it works, it acts like a 102 to the 102 and a 108 to the 108. It's seamless enough that you don't need to worry about it. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/664212762667552768
