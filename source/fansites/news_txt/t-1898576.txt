Patch 6.2.3 PTR - Build 20726
There was another PTR build tonight that was flagged as Release, no major changes from the previous one. We got the PvP Season ending warning  a few weeks ago, so it should be going live soon!


  


Blizzcon - Legion Developer Interview
Final Boss  had the opportunity to talk to Lead Game Designer Luis Barriga at Blizzcon.


<iframe width="900" height="100" src="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


The UI has been updated with new health bars. Example  from Vanion's stream
All of the new things that made Warlords leveling great will be a part of Legion leveling in one form or another.
The team has spaced out the cinematics during leveling differently this time, rather than just doing one cinematic at the end of each zone.
Alliance get a Genn Greymane quest line and Horde get a Sylvanas quest line in Stormheim. 
In Warlords, if you skipped the rares while leveling you would go back to find they were no longer a challenge and no longer had relevant rewards. In Legion they will scale with your level, so you can go back and kill them for a challenge and better reward.
The team hears the requests for Stormwind Park repairs, but no comments on it for now. "You never know, you ask for something long enough and you never know what will happen"
The main-hand and off-hands for the Artifact weapons will change their look together, you can't pick and choose each individually. There is only one icon for these items, you click it and both main-hand and off-hand are filled. The technology is there to be used elsewhere if needed after Artifacts.
The team touched up the melee animations for Legion, so some of the clipping issues may have been resolved. In some poses the largest models may still have clipping issues.
Rogues got new finisher animations, Warriors got a new Mortal Strike animation, swipes and effects also were updated.
The team is investigating showing weapons somehow for bear form Druids. They aren't sure if it can be done, but they will get customization to their bear form when they have the Artifact equipped.
Multistrike causing two melee ability animations to go off was slightly problematic, as it would be more noticeable if you very quickly did two Moral Strikes. 
All classes have multiple legendary items, with some being specific to a class, spec, or role and some being more universal. 
If any, very few of the legendary items are BoE, they should be BoP. The intention is to create really awesome reward moments, not something to buy. 



Legion Class Preview Feedback
Now that the class blogs are done we can take a look at all of the feedback so far from the developers!

 Death Knight Forums 
will Blood DKs get some on demand AoE for getting threat on more targets if DnD is on CD?
Blood still has access to Blood Boil for spreading diseases and generating threat. WarcraftDevs 

Cons spammable to be always up, D&D for 10s every 30s? I feel like we need better cleave. Like a Heart Strike talent.
Crimson Scourge will help with your AOE capabilities. Plus, there is just such a talent. WarcraftDevs 

Blood DK Bone Shield is a buff w/ charges that players need to watch. Removed from most specs due to UI, why is Blood exempt?
Bone Shield charges will also display on the Marrowrend icon. WarcraftDevs 
do bone shield still have an internal cooldown for triggering charges?
Yes, still one second. WarcraftDevs 

Why wouldn't DKs ignore the new Killing Machine? From the article, would be ignored by design; Obliterate randomly crits more.
It's still possible to overwrite waste Killing Machine procs if you don't use them before the next proc. WarcraftDevs 

Any chance Killing Machine devaluing crit will be addressed?
Different stats having different values isn't bad, as long as they're not terrible. Either way, yes, several talents affect this. WarcraftDevs 

As a noob DK, dw frost rotation has seemed unintuitive. If I should only use Oblit with KM, force it as unusable outside it?
Obliterate will be useful both with and without Killing Machine. You'll still want to minimize wasted KM procs, though. WarcraftDevs 

Just for clarification KM only affects obliterate now and not frost strike? not a typo?
Correct, not a typo. However, it may be modified by talents. WarcraftDevs 

clarification... Does legion outbreak apply diseases every 1 second for 6 seconds in an aoe?
Yes. The target pulses the disease application every second for 6 seconds. WarcraftDevs 

Would 1 Scourge Strike pop all the Festering Wounds on your target? Like, is the plan FS, FS, FS, SS or is it FS, SS, SS, SS?
Scourge Strike triggers only one Festering Wound at a time. WarcraftDevs 

Clarify Frost Fever? You have a chance to get a 30 sec buff? A chance to get RP on tick?
Each time Frost Fever deals damage, the Death Knight has a chance to gain Runic Power. WarcraftDevs 

I like the DK preview but I am concerned about the Frost rotation. It is VERY simple. Is additional rotational depth coming?
Baseline classes in Legion lean a little simpler, so that we can add a wide array of complexity via talents. WarcraftDevs 

Is it safe to assume that Death and decay and Defile are gone for frost dk's in place of remorseless winter for an AOE CD?
Yes, Frost DKs will have Remorseless Winter for AoE, along with a few potential talents. WarcraftDevs 

</div>
<div id="tab2">
 Druid Forums 
Do Druids lose access to forms not associated with their spec or affinity or does everyone keep cat, bear, etc?
You still keep access to the forms, but have very few or no abilities in the ones you don't have an Affinity for. WarcraftDevs 

How will Druid affinities work with the Artifact weapons? Will there be some kind of automatic conversion to support it?
No, Artifacts remain spec-specific. You won't need to swap weapons to use your Affinity. WarcraftDevs 

The way I am reading it, seems like the affinity passives maybe built into their base specs?
Correct. Every Druid spec has the benefit from it's associated Affinity built in. WarcraftDevs 

Puns aside, is hurricane still in game and useful?
Hurricane is currently planned to be an AoE damage ability for Restoration only. WarcraftDevs 

Does Starsurge give you one of each empowerment or just one empowerment that effects both spells?
One charge of each Empowerment. You'll want to use one Lunar Strike and one Solar Wrath to spend both of them. WarcraftDevs 

I think you have a typo on star surge preview . As awesome as Astral damage sounds don't you mean arcane damage?
Nope. The combination of Nature and Arcane schools formerly called Spellstorm is now called Astral. WarcraftDevs 

With starfall being targeted now, what is the range on the area we select?
We're still tuning it, but it's intended to be very large. Something like a 15 yard radius over 3.5x the area of Blizzard. WarcraftDevs 
There's also a pretty fun talent that makes it 30% larger still, and allows you to cast while moving while inside it. WarcraftDevs 

Do Balance Druids still use mana? They don't have mana costs listed in their section of the overview.
Balance Druids have a secondary mana bar that they only use outside of form, similar to Feral. WarcraftDevs 

If I'm playing Feral w/ guardian affinity, could I perform a 3rd tank role in encounters using a 3-tank strategy?
The intention is that any Druid with Guardian Affinity can tank something, as long as it's not overly hard-hitting. WarcraftDevs 

Are ferals supposed to be swapping to Moonkin after they dump energy to cast while regening energy in Legion?
The version of Moonkin Form granted by Balance Affinity will have a cooldown to prevent using it rotationally. WarcraftDevs 

What is the reasoning behind keeping feral automatic stealthed rake stun in PvP? It makes for uninteresting gameplay.
Incarnation no longer affects Rake in Legion. WarcraftDevs 

Is there any further information to share on how Rage generation will work for Guardians? Only Mangle identified in the blog.
Auto-attacks are still the most significant source of Rage for Guardians. When we get to tuning, we'll see if more is needed. WarcraftDevs 

Where iz Maul? How can bare Maul face if bare can no Maul?
Maul is only used to turn excess Rage into damage when not tanking, so it wasn't listed in the blog. It's still available. WarcraftDevs 

For the record, Ironfur stacks. It doesn't mean the duration increases, it means that for each charge used consecutively it goes up by 100%
It *overlaps*, which is slightly different. You gain and lose each stack individually. It doesn't just grow indefinitely. WarcraftDevs 

Will harmony count towards spells activating it e.g. reju buffs itself, or is it just a buff towards different spells?
A HoT will count itself for purposes of Harmony. A lone Rejuvenation will get 1x benefit from mastery. WarcraftDevs 

Resto Druid Harmony applies to all healing done by the druid, including Tranq? Rejuv have regular GCD?
All of these guesses are correct! WarcraftDevs 

The return of Thorns was mentioned at Blizzcon, but I don't see it here?
Restoration has Thorns as a tool to increase damage while soloing. Not all abilities are covered in the blog. WarcraftDevs 

re: new Druid Mastery "10% per HoT" is that unique HoTs like Regrowth+Rejuv or Germination style Rejuv x2? What is max %? 50?
It counts all active HoTs. Currently, there is no cap. WarcraftDevs 

will the first Rejuv update its current HoT value each additional HoT that comes down, or will we have to recast once fully HoTed?
It updates dynamically for all HoTs. No snapshotting. WarcraftDevs 

is Tranquility gone or a talent?
Neither. Tranquility is still present and generally similar to its current form. WarcraftDevs

 Hunter Forums 
#Hunters: it's that time again! What pet families would you like to see added in #Legion? Muffinus 

are you able to say if MM hunters can still summon a pet at all in legion? I like being petless but pet tank is convenient
They currently have a "Dark Ranger" talent which has a chance to summon an undead minion. That minion can also tank.  WarcraftDevs 

Hey is there any way hunters can keep black arrow? Give it to marksman perhaps
Yes! The current plan is for Black Arrow and Lock and Load to become Marksmanship-specific talents. WarcraftDevs 

is aimed shot still able to be cast on the move?
No, but that's partially offset by its faster cast time, less frequent use, and the return of Arcane Shot. WarcraftDevs 

my only concern is how punishing survival might be when losing the mongoose bite buff
Mongoose stacks aren't something you maintain. Their stacking encourages you to pool them, then use as many as you can. WarcraftDevs 

Still trying to figure out how they want Mongoose Bite to be used. How can you get 6 stacks in 3.5s with the GCD?
The duration is refreshed with each use. You'll want to alternate Mongoose Bite and other abilities, to proc more Mongoose charges WarcraftDevs 

flanking strike is basically kill command? Love everything else, that caught me up a little
That tooltip was slightly outdated. Flanking Strike causes you and your pet to attack at the same time. WarcraftDevs 

What % is Surv expected to be in melee? 80? 100? New melee class?
Survival is going to be a 100% legit melee spec. Celestalon 

For BM, are you planning on keeping BW as is? And does the 15s off BW CD from DB reduce by a further 15s every time used?
Bestial Wrath is largely unchanged. Each time you use Dire Beast, the remaining cooldown on BW is reduced. WarcraftDevs 

</div>
<div id="tab4">
 Mage Forums 
If mastery increases your maximum mana, but spells still use X% of your mana, mages aren't gaining anything, clarity please?
Spell costs are a % of BASE mana. The costs don't increase with Mastery. WarcraftDevs 

Frost mage: Will we still have Icy Veins and will it give Haste ?
Yep, and yep. WarcraftDevs 

Is Frostfire Bolt gone? Very valuable in PvP. Sad to see Icicles sticking around, really don't like it. Shatter mastery pls.
For those who dislike Icicles, we currently have a talent planned that will replace them with a new active ability. WarcraftDevs 

Is Ice Nova for frost mages being removed with Legion?
We recognize the issues that the Nova talents have caused, especially in PvP. WarcraftDevs 
We're planning to test out an alternate design where they don't replace Frost Nova, but only have 1 charge. WarcraftDevs 

can you elaborate on Flamestrike vs Pyro last on Hot Streak proc. How does Flamestrike work in #Legion
Flamestrike remains similar, though it has a longer cast time and much more damage. Alternative AoE use for Hot Streaks. WarcraftDevs 

Concerning the fire changes, what about spreading Living Bomb/Pyro DoT? I loved seeing groups of mobs explode =
Hot Streaked Pyroblasts and Flamestrikes create a larger Ignite, instead of their own DoT. WarcraftDevs 
Ignite spreads on its own, and Living Bomb is spreadable via Inferno Blast. WarcraftDevs 
will it ignore CCed targets like Starfall?
The current plan is that Ignite will not automatically spread to crowd controlled targets. WarcraftDevs 

When it says ignite "may" spread to nearby targets, what does that actually mean?
Every 2 sec., one of your Ignites chosen at random will spread to a random other target within 5yd that has a weaker/no ignite. WarcraftDevs 
'One of your ignites' - are they not all rolled into one any more?
They are still rolled into one on each target. You may have Ignite on multiple targets, though. WarcraftDevs 
will mastery % affect the chance that it will spread?
A random Ignite will spread every 2 seconds. No further chances. WarcraftDevs 
Clarification on the mastery chance to spread ignite. I feel like we won't have any control over our dot spreading 
Curious what control you're looking for? It just spreading quickly and constantly seems almost purely better, no? Celestalon 
Update to this, based on feedback: every 2 sec, *each* of your Ignites will spread. WarcraftDevs

 Monk Forums 
Are monk still keeping their mobility?
Roll, Transcendence, and several talents will continue to provide Monks with great mobility. WarcraftDevs 

Really wondering why Brewmaster's artifact doesn't come with a keg? Even if it wasn't an artifact persay. It looks really
It actually does! We're working to tie the Brewmaster staff including the keg into their combat animations. WarcraftDevs 

With Guard gone, what will Brewmasters use to mitigate magic damage?
Stagger now works against magic damage at 50% effectiveness. WarcraftDevs 

Does Expel Harm still exists for Brewmasters? I kind of liked it.
The gameplay from Expel Harm was merged into a new, stronger version of Gift of the Ox. WarcraftDevs 

Elusive Brew is also better as an active ability. That dodge mastery is very unappealing. Can't stagger improve with mastery?
It's important to note that the Elusive Brawler mastery effect can stack, making it extremely reliable. WarcraftDevs 

what's the usefulness of energy for brews now? Cooldowns and huge energy costs on tiger palm and keg smash?
Tiger Palm is actually 25 Energy for Brewmasters, 50 for Windwalker. That's a mistake in the blog, and will be fixed shortly! WarcraftDevs 

with these changes, I feel you're making us even slower than we already are. Please don't take our identity.
Could you clarify what you're talking about? What suggests to you that it's somehow slower? Would like to help clarify it. Celestalon 
Tigers Palm costs more energy. What about doing it the other way around? Incorporate TP on jab, since Jab is more iconic
OK. The rotation is faster, not slower, but you got the impression that it was based on the TP cost. Good to know, thanks! Celestalon 
But, regarding my second question, don't you think jab is more iconic? TP doesn't even have that much of visual effect...
Could you double-check that? I think you might be mixing them up. Jab has virtually no visual on live, TP has a strong iconic. Celestalon 

Chi-Ji is my favorite Celestial; I hope there are plans to bring back a Crane theme for Monks in the future?
We love Chi-Ji too! Keep an eye out for a new talent: "Invoke Chi-Ji, the Red Crane." WarcraftDevs 

P-please tell me you didn't just remove monk stuns from FoF, that would be soul crushing
We're planning to include a PvP talent that will return the stun to Fists of Fury. WarcraftDevs 

Is Tigereye Brew … gone?
Tigereye Brew is a classic 1.5 minute DPS cooldown now. WarcraftDevs 

I really like the Fighting Game approach with WW. Have they got any talents related to this? Maybe something like Gauge bars?
There's a talent that enhances WW Mastery by rewarding combo chains. We're hoping to see fighting game style UI addons for it WarcraftDevs 

wait - is jab gone? Is tiger palm the new jab? Do I not have to keep up tiger palm? Who am I?
Jab and Tiger Palm were effectively merged. There is no more Tiger Power. WarcraftDevs 

will WW end up sitting and waiting for CDs to avoid using the same ability twice?
Windwalker's GCDs are fairly filled; relatively little time waiting around. Mastery favors ordering your abilities well. WarcraftDevs 

please consider bringing Spinning Fire Blossom back, and make surging mist proc just like every other hybrid Retris, Ferals..
We look forward to your feedback on Spinning Fire Blossom and other PvP talents once Beta begins! WarcraftDevs 

MW mastery seems like a cheap copy of Versatility and very boring. Seems very similar to all other healer masteries except disc.
It's actually fairly different from other healer masteries: it's a flat amount, not a percentage. WarcraftDevs 

Does the new soothing mist have a cast bar? Can it be interrupted?
Soothing Mist has a channel bar, but no duration. We're considering multiple options for how interrupts affect it. WarcraftDevs 
Currently, we're trying it beeing uninterruptible. We may also try having it interruptible, but on the Physical school. WarcraftDevs 
Lastly, can I move while soothing mist is active?
There's a talent which will allow you to do just that! WarcraftDevs 

Why cast Effuse? Cast a bigger heal like Renewing and just let the passives do the maintenance healing over time. Same HPM.
Effuse is a fast and cheap way to start Soothing on a target. It's the Monk's answer to spells like the Priest's "Heal." WarcraftDevs 

Is the statue gone for mistweavers? and how will they be able to level as healers with fistweaving removed?
There is a talent that brings back the Statue for players who miss it. WarcraftDevs 

2 Mistweaver questions: still melee? and is mana tea still around?
Mana Tea is no longer present in its current form, but there is a new variant of it in talents. WarcraftDevs 

Does this mean Mistweavers will no longer be immune to ranged mechanics? No longer considered melee?
Correct. Mistweavers will now be treated like other ranged specs for the purpose of encounter ability targeting. WarcraftDevs 

Mistweaver clarifications: Movement will interrupt soothing mists? When Renewing mist "travels" is it removed from 1st target?
When Renewing Mist overheals, it leaves the overhealed target, and moves to a new target. WarcraftDevs 

love the new mistweavers kit. Any chance there's a talent to make essence font like rjw, cast other things while using it?
The channel on Essence Font is there to help balance its large amount of total healing. At 3 seconds, it's still quite flexible. WarcraftDevs 

With FW gone for MW what damaging abilities do we have for "solo questing outdoors"? Not mad crane is rip,just wondering.
Mistweaver will still have melee abilities for dealing damage, they're just not dual-purposed into providing smart heals. WarcraftDevs 
In a world where healers are to do more damage in the down time during bosses, how are we to do that at range?
During an encounter where you can't be in melee, Crackling Jade Lightning makes a good fallback. WarcraftDevs

 Paladin Forums 
does haste will continue to lower CDs and GCD?
Yes, Haste continues to lower GCDs and the CDs of rotational abilities, same as before. WarcraftDevs 

if Holy paladins have only cast time heals, how are they supposed to move and cast to be near targets?
Check out Light of the Martyr. Celestalon 

Is Mastery: Lightbringer Linear with distance or some other shape?
It's generally linear, but there is a minimum radius in which you will always receive 100% benefit. WarcraftDevs 

Does Lightbringer heal the tank through the Beacon if you have Beacon of the Lightbringer?
Lightbringer affects your direct heal already, so it doesn't affect the Beacon transfer again. WarcraftDevs 
So if I heal the tank who has Beacon he won't get any benefit from Lightbringer unless I'm stood next to the tank?
If you have Beacon of the Lightbringer and cast directly onto your Beacon, it will get 100% mastery benefit. WarcraftDevs 

How will HPal mast affect Beacon? Will Beacon xfer 50% of total heal or will it be lowered by being further away
The Beacon will transfer 50% of the total heal, regardless of where the Beacon target is standing. WarcraftDevs 

Hey any chance my holy pally can get some damage in, I always enjoyed hitting a crusader strike for an hp, or melee for mana
We don't want to force Holy Paladins into attacking as part of their rotation, but talents can add that gameplay by choice. WarcraftDevs 

Will we see changes to holy pal. mobility to complement the requirement for proximity & thus more movement? Cant run & cast.
We added an extremely strong spell for Holy Paladin mobility. Check out Light of the Martyr. WarcraftDevs 


the new ret paladin rotation seems to possibly have a lot of downtime. Will other spells and talents play a part as well?
Absolutely. The baseline rotation has a fair bit of room in it, because talents fill quite a few GCDs. WarcraftDevs 

will Retribution still have Hammer of Wrath?
Hammer of Wrath has been removed in order to improve class/spec distinction. 1/3 WarcraftDevs 
Warriors are intended to be the kings of the Execute mechanic, and others had crept too far into that territory. WarcraftDevs 
However, for those who may miss throwing Hammers, there's a snazzy new visual on Judgment that may interest you! 3/3 WarcraftDevs 

What's that Hand of Hindrance that being replaced by some talent?
A new snare ability for Retribution. Stay tuned for details. WarcraftDevs 
well but that way we still have to stare at charges, now its just at the bottom half of the screen instead of the top, right ?
We feel that's a pretty important distinction. You're already watching your action bars for ability cooldowns/usability. WarcraftDevs 

while i love the ability, Lothar was a warrior. maybe consider calling it Turalyon's might instead of Lothar?
Indeed, you are quite correct! We'll adjust the name. Thanks! WarcraftDevs 

Does Light of the Protector have charges? Wording on Redoubt indicates yes, but if so how many?
That was a typo. We'll get it fixed. Earlier in development, Light of the Protector shared charges with Shield of the Righteous. WarcraftDevs 

Chance of prot pally getting a baseline 1s GCD? No Holy Power makes Haste unattractive, and game play as a whole much slower.
Haste will reduce Shield of the Righteous recharge time and Light of the Protector cooldown, similar to other rotation abilities. WarcraftDevs 

So... if mana doesn't matter for Protection paladins and they're losing holy power... what *is* the resource they're managing?
Charges of Shield of the Righteous fill the same role, with more flexibility. WarcraftDevs 

was Guardian of Ancient Kings removed?
No, the blog just lists core combat abilities. Guardian may be tweaked slightly, but maintains the same purpose. WarcraftDevs 

</div>
<div id="tab7">
 Priest Forums 
No mention of Holy Nova. Is it gone?
The current plan is for Holy Nova to be Holy's method of dealing AoE damage. WarcraftDevs 

Will Holy Priest have an AoE damage spell, since Mind Sear is now out? Holy Nova seems like the obvious solution
The current plan is to remove Weakened Soul. WarcraftDevs 
Holy Nova is, in fact, the current plan! All healers will have some capacity to damage multiple targets. WarcraftDevs 

Love the Holy Priest redesign. Hope for fun smiting talents to go with it. Does Holy Word: Sanctify replace Circle of Healing?
We're currently considering talent options that bring back Circle of Healing, or something similar. WarcraftDevs 

Just reading priest blog and unless im mistaken PoH group restriction appears gone. Is that so  *crosses fingers* 
Indeed! We're trying a different targeting method for Prayer of Healing, which makes it more localized instead of group-based. WarcraftDevs 

Any news on PoH being "closest 5 targets" like WG?, making efficient PoH groups isn't fun and should be fixed.
In #Legion, Prayer of Healing will choose allies within a radius instead of being group-based. WarcraftDevs 

"for an absolutely massive amount". #winning
A crit Holy Word: Serenity is basically a full heal. We think that qualifies as "absolutely massive." WarcraftDevs 

Will Holy Word: Serenity still apply a crit buff, as it does currently?
No. The spell is now entirely focused into being a very large instant heal. WarcraftDevs 

there is no mention of Divine Aegis in the priest blog, is it going to be gone?
Yes. The number of absorbs especially passive ones, such as Divine Aegis and Illuminated Healing is being heavily reduced. WarcraftDevs 

penance damage only?Remove pom cast, it is only used as purge protection atm
Talents will offer some potential alterations to Penance. WarcraftDevs 

Bit of conflicting info. Darkmoon Faire Q&A made it sound like Disc. was losing PW:S, blog shows it as a spell. Is it staying?
Discipline still has Power Word: Shield, but it will have a 6-second cooldown, to reduce spamminess. WarcraftDevs 

It just seems weird that DIsc, which was never really about DPS healing, has pivoted to it, while MW, which was, is cutting it
That's definitely fair. There are many reasons, but a big one is that Priests have another spec if you don't like DPS->Heal. WarcraftDevs 
Chadd, how long is the atonement buff supposed to be?
Currently 15 seconds, with a talent available to extend that to 20 seconds. WarcraftDevs 

How will Atonement work when enemies have damage taken up or down buffs?
Atonement healing should not be affected by those. WarcraftDevs 

is atonement a buff that gets renewed or extended? for example, casting plea 2x in a row on same target = 15 sec or 30?
It gets renewed. We're considering having it behave similar to DoT effects, which have some leeway on when you refresh. WarcraftDevs 

will solo healing 5-mans be inherently more difficult for discipline due to the changes in legion?
We'll be making sure that Discipline is still able to heal dungeons comfortably. WarcraftDevs 

Disc's 70/30 - how will healing be competitive without damage being significant. Guaranteed Disc raid spot still exists?
Those were just off-the-cuff examples. Goal is that they provide respectable damage and healing, and we'll iterate as necessary. WarcraftDevs 

So how viable will leveling as Discipline be in Legion? I love Disc and don't want to go away from it to even level.
The goal is for healing specs to be fully viable for solo questing outdoors. WarcraftDevs 

In Legion, will Shadow Mend overhealing still trigger the DoT? Basically, is it possible for it to be a net loss?
Nope! Only the effective healing will turn into a DoT. WarcraftDevs 

How does Void Form's Haste Buff work if i enter Void Form instantly via Oblivion? Reset, Stack further, new Stack?
When Voidform ends, you get a buff that provides the Haste from that Voidform for 20 sec. It stacks with the next Voidform. WarcraftDevs 

unclear in the blog: is insanity capped at 100, is void form toggleable?
Yes, Insanity is capped at 100. Voidform is automatically activated, not toggled. WarcraftDevs 

On the usefulllessness of the Mastery Insanity Generation Increase: 
Voidform doesn't stop your abilities from generating Insanity. Mastery will allow you to maintain Voidform longer/stronger. WarcraftDevs 

I WILL HEAL YOU TO DEATH! GLORY TO CTHULU, FTHAGN RY'LEH!
Sounds like you may enjoy the fact that you're forced to speak Shath'yar - the language of the Old Gods - while in Voidform. WarcraftDevs 

I hope that Shadow talents will contain several options to control Insanity When you enter, leave early, stay in longer, etc.
Anything can change, but we currently have 8 different talents that relate to Insanity. WarcraftDevs 

Was just curious about how fast the drain is-it will always be greater, at least to some degree, than our ability to generate?
At first, the Voidform drain is slower than you can generate Insanity, but it ramps up over time, draining faster and faster. WarcraftDevs 

Insanity shares some of the pre-WoD eclipse problem. Idea: Remove damage buff, make it about max. DoT extension/Haste Buff.
You'll be able to return to Voidform very quickly, thanks to the Haste from your previous Voidform persisting for 20 seconds. WarcraftDevs

 Rogue Forums 
If we do have to have positional requirements then the UI needs to communicate what "behind" is without trial and error.
There are changes incoming to the targeting selection circle that show the direction your target is facing. WarcraftDevs 
That isn't really enough, I don't know about you guys but rapidly marking out 60 degree arcs in your head isn't easy.
Backstab will also count the sides. WarcraftDevs 

Would it be possible to add the 5 combo point duration to DoT finishers on the blog?
Nightblade is up to 24 seconds. Envenom is up to 6 seconds. Rupture is 24 seconds. WarcraftDevs 
What kind of debuff is nightblade? Magic? Physical?
Nightblade will be Shadow damage. Whether it's dispellable or not will depend on PvP balance, but we recognize its importance WarcraftDevs 

Will Assassination and Subtlety AoE be made equivalently powerful with Outlaw/Blade Flurry?
Yes, we plan to make all Rogue specs competitive in AoE situations. WarcraftDevs 

What happenes with Vendetta ?
The blog focused on rotational abilities. Vendetta, Adrenaline Rush, and Shadow Blades are burst CDs for each spec, respectively WarcraftDevs 

Loved the rogue preview but... Anticipation: baseline please?
Anticipation remains a talent. However, it has some serious competition on its talent row now. WarcraftDevs 

Pretty disappointed Assa still isn't active poisoning. And no thrown poison vial? Outlaw losing PvP stun/silence from stealth?
Assassination does have an ability that throws a poisoned dagger, applying your poison at range. It's just not in the blog. WarcraftDevs 

At the start of legion as assassination a rogue will have 18.3 energy/sec. For comparison in wrath AR only brought combat to ~22 energy/sec.
There's still a lot of tuning to be done. Venomous Wounds will be tuned so that pooling is still important. WarcraftDevs 

Does Venomous Wounds still do damage on proc or just energy regen?
Just energy regen. WarcraftDevs 

How will you make Pistol Shot's animation work seeing as it is an instant cast and the weapon has to be drawn quickly?
It's pretty quick. We're looking forward to feedback on new animations once Beta begins! WarcraftDevs 

Please, tell me that Co-..Outlaw rogues instead of throw will have shoot vial their pistol! Please !! :D
Indeed. Pistol Shot provides a ranged snare and minor damage which is heavily increased with the proc from Saber Slash. WarcraftDevs 

.pistol shot'll let me damage & gain combo points from range. Awesome! Will there be a ranged finisher? 
Yes! Instead of Kidney Shot, Outlaws have a pistol-based finisher which deals damage and stuns from range. WarcraftDevs 

Why is it called Shadowstrike and not Ghostly Strike?
Because Ghostly Strike is a talent for Outlaws! WarcraftDevs 

Is Hemorrhage still a thing for Sub Rogues?
We may keep it in some form, possibly as a talent. WarcraftDevs 

. With substantial changes to the Sub Rogue’s Stealth uptime, should we expect to see Find Weakness in #Legion?
With the new Shadow Dance design, Find Weakness no longer makes sense, so it has been removed. WarcraftDevs 

Does Shadowstrike have a cooldown?
Nope! WarcraftDevs 

Shadowstepping on every Shadowstrike seems dangerous in PvE. Will there be a way to lessen our need to be in a backstab zone?
Shadowstrike will not teleport you if you are already in melee range. WarcraftDevs 

You know... quickly teleport behind enemy, stab in back, teleport back to original position.
When you use Backstab, it's likely just after you used Shadowstrike, which did just that. Celestalon

 Shaman Forums 
Any chance of Shamans being able to wield the Doomhammer two-handed? Even if just a cosmetic glyph for us old classic Shamans 
Not likely, the model isn't really scaled to look good with 2-hand animations. It WOULD feel old-school though! DaveKosak 

Having that badass lightning fist artifact for elem shamans is great; but will it stick around on the model during casts?
Yes, your fist weapon will remain unsheathed during casting. It's one of the major reasons we chose it for Elemental's artifact! WarcraftDevs 

do Crits increase the amount of Maelstrom generated?
No, Maelstrom generation does not increase on critical strikes. WarcraftDevs 

It seems implied from the blog, but is Fulmination is entirely gone as it stands?
Not as "Fulmination", but the mechanic still exists through building up high Maelstrom and spending it using Earth Shock. WarcraftDevs 

Overload's 75% damage & Maelstrom generation means LB Overloads = 11.25 Maelstrom generated?
Correct. WarcraftDevs 

No mention of Earthquake, is it gone?
Nope, it's still there, as an AoE-focused Maelstrom spender. The blogs are just only listing core combat abilities. WarcraftDevs 

No shared shock CD is nice, but I don't think that will do enough to resolve the empty time while moving problems.
Note that Shocks have no cooldowns at all now - including Flame Shock. WarcraftDevs 
ele is meant to spam flameshock while moving? If we use a maelstrom enhance flameshock then another one will it reduce the DOT
Recasting Flame Shock will never shorten the DoT. WarcraftDevs 

Could we get an example of reliable Enhancement AOE in Legion? Would appreciated.
Enhancement has a new frontal-cone AoE spell called Crash Lightning, which also causes Stormstrike and Lava Lash to trigger AoEs. WarcraftDevs 

Any details on the negative effects on Enhance shamans that hit Maelstrom cap?"They must be careful not to let it overflow"
That line is simply referring to the potential to accidentally waste it by overflowing. No other negative effects. WarcraftDevs 

I don't see it mentioned, but is Searing Totem still a core part of Enhancement Shamans "maintenance" buffs or was it removed?
Searing Totem wasn't really providing compelling gameplay, so it's been removed in Legion. WarcraftDevs 

Will Enhance have a way to pull targets at range? No 30 yard reach on lightning bolt now
Enhancement still has Lightning Bolt for exactly this purpose. It's just not part of your core rotation. WarcraftDevs 

Do the Windfury attacks trigger Maelstrom Weapon?
Yes, Windfury attacks will trigger Maelstrom Weapon. WarcraftDevs 

Rockbiter without a cooldown? Just curious.
Correct, there is no cooldown on Rockbiter. WarcraftDevs 

Windfury seems to be losing it's significance. With no Maelstrom and minor damage, it feels just there for legacy.
Check out the other clarifications we've made; it does generate Maelstrom, and is not minor total damage. Celestalon 

any info on healing as elemental or enhancement? will it cost maelstrom? or maybe build it?
Healing Surge will cost Maelstrom for both Elemental and Enhancement. WarcraftDevs 
should do like Flame shock and make it a "0-20" type deal so we can cast lesser heals out of combat etc.
That's currently the plan, in fact! WarcraftDevs 

Can you go into depth about how you are shifting Resto to more targeted heals instead of Chain Heal spam?
Mostly by simply making the direct heals more competitive, but also by ensuring mana remains relevant throughout the expansion. WarcraftDevs 

Will there be anything like a talent for the Resto Shamans that do enjoy the Chain Heal spam?
Yes, there are talent options that buff Chain Heal and let you focus on it more heavily. WarcraftDevs

 Warlock Forums 
how many soul shards do each of the Warlock specs have and are there ways to regen them out of combat? Also is life tap gone?
Maximum of 5 for all specs. 1 regens out of combat. There are other sources, including out of combat, in talents. WarcraftDevs 

.I would really like some clarification of this phrase: "and causing some demons to be favored based on the Warlock’s spec."
When all pets' damage was equal, everyone used an Imp. In Legion, each spec will slightly favor one demon for raw DPS. WarcraftDevs 
Affliction slightly favors Felhunters. Demonology favors Felguards, and Destruction favors Imps. Others offer strong utility. WarcraftDevs 

Will we still keep our green fire?
Green Fire is staying. Don't worry. WarcraftDevs 

How do Warlocks regen Mana in Legion? Life Tap? Stuff like the initial Affliction Artifact Talent? Both?
Yes, all Warlocks will use Life Tap in Legion.  WarcraftDevs 

Warlocks look great. Concerns for spec loyalty being a goal tho. It will take some AOE talents for AFF to not get overshadowed 
There's a particularly interesting talent that makes Seed of Corruption apply as an AoE, but cost a soul shard. Pop pop pop! WarcraftDevs 

Is Affliction's Haunt ability gone? Also I'd like to hear more about Affli/Destro AoE.
Haunt is returning as a talent, with a slightly different design. Stay tuned for details. WarcraftDevs 

stuns they already had... So how effective is Drain Life really going to be,too much of a PvP liability
We're very conscious of this concern. The good thing is that we can add customization and tuning via Legion PvP systems. WarcraftDevs 

is there ANY justifiable reason to keep CB as shadow damage, not as chaos damage?
We'd actually be interested in hearing discussion on this, after clearing up a common misconception: 1/2 WarcraftDevs 
Chaos damage does NOT inherently bypass shields/immunity. Interrupting it would lock ALL schools. Still want that? 2/2 WarcraftDevs 

Single-Target Base SoulShard generation for Destro looks slow. 2 every 16 sec + low RNG on Immo. Talents for more?
Indeed, there are several talents that deal with Soul Shards. WarcraftDevs 

“buffs up to three of your active pets” does that mean that Demo can have multiple different demon types up?
It can affect your primary demon pet, Infernal or Doomguard, Grimoire of Service pets, Dreadstalkers, and Wild Imps. WarcraftDevs 

I'd prefer if all demons were buffed, so I don't have to track which are my most powerful 3 and when are they about to despawn.
Then you'll be quite interested in the Power Trip talent, which does exactly that! WarcraftDevs 

... most of the temporary demons are also alive only for 12 sec. What if I have a strong demon that's going to despawn in 2 sec?
Managing when to cast Demonic Empowerment will be a key part of mastering Demonology gameplay. WarcraftDevs 

Wheres FnB? I hope it's still here, because if not that new talent won't save the day for destruction.
Shadowburn is a talent, with improved usability. Fire and Brimstone is a talent that passively makes Incinerate AoE. WarcraftDevs 

Can you clarify the "limit 1" on Havoc's description? Limit 1 what?
You may only place Havoc on one target at a time. That matters when it's improved via talents. WarcraftDevs 

what does 'Your Destruction spells deal up to x% additional damage, randomly' mean? how does that work?
Mastery provides a damage bonus to those spells, but it's a random % increase, up to the very high Mastery % 1/2 WarcraftDevs 
The frequency of your attacks will quickly smooth out the RNG element, but it's always possible you might prefer other stats. WarcraftDevs

 Warrior Forums 
On the warrior blog coming this week, will it be discussed why their artifacts were chosen to all be swords. No axes or hammers?
We went with swords for wider appeal, but there's a variant we haven't shown yet that you might like. WarcraftDevs 

Serious missed opportunity not giving arms warriors the forged by cenarius for Broxigar. If there was ever an expac...
Yeah, thought about doing that one for a long while. In the end, a wooden nature themed axe didn't feel right, despite lore. craig_amai 

really? this is what you bring to the table for warriors? you say they overpower their foes, yet take away overpower?
I think you may have read that backwards. Refer to the paragraphs about Warriors in general for some good news! Celestalon 

The Arms Warrior talent "Titanic Might", the halving of effectiveness, does that work with the Mastery also?
Yes. Titanic Might effectively gives you a half-strength Colossus Smash with a 100% uptime. WarcraftDevs 

Makes sense. It would be nice to have as a Rage generator. Auto-attacks alone won't cut it, I fear.
Charge, autoattacks, and talents will provide plenty of Rage for Arms Warriors. WarcraftDevs 

Overpower and HS are talents, right? Are they spec specific? Do they work as they used to? Will either replace whirlwind? <3
Overpower and Heroic Strike are talents for Arms and Fury. They don't replace anything. Heroic Strike is baseline for Protection. WarcraftDevs 

Did I read correctly that Fury *takes* 30% more dmg while Enraged?
Correct. Being Enraged reduces your defenses. However, that's offset by a much higher max health, and very high self-healing. WarcraftDevs 
if you are one shotted it's useless more self healing
Does having 31% more max health not help with that? Celestalon 
We'll tune this as needed to ensure that Fury Warriors are not a liability. 30% may not be the correct number. WarcraftDevs 

I'm not seeing myself camping defensive stance just so I can survive when others are fine.
We will not expect Fury Warriors to swap to Defensive Stance whenever they expect to take damage. WarcraftDevs 

Is Rampage Fury Warr a channeled ability? Imo channeled abilities are boring.
Rampage is not channeled. You maintain full control during its animation, apart from being on GCD, like any other attack. WarcraftDevs 
So we'll be able to move? What about use other abilities during that 2 sec?
You can move and use off-GCD abilities, while you are on GCD. Celestalon 

Why doesn't Rampage just trigger Enrage? Take some emphasis off randomness of BT crit, which is a major concern. @Celestalon
Rampage always deals damage as though you're Enraged. You don't have to wait until Enrage to use it. WarcraftDevs 

By the artifact for Fury warriors it's not certain that they wield 2H weapons At least for me could we have more information
Fury's artifact is indeed a pair of 2-handed weapons. They looked a little small in the preview; we'll be scaling them up a bit. WarcraftDevs 

What gives fury warriors "much higher max health"?
A passive +25% bonus to max health, and Titan's Grip which roughly amounts to another 6%, typically. WarcraftDevs 
wait so you are adding 25% more health? on top of TG?
Yes. Celestalon 
Warrior preview. Prot. Move heroic strike off gcd again and add small cooldown instead. Useless burner and choice otherwise 
Heroic Strike is still off of GCD. That hasn't changed. WarcraftDevs 

will ignore pain count as active mitigation? Currently for some reason shield barrier doesnt.
Yes, Ignore Pain is considered Active Mitigation. WarcraftDevs 

Plz clarify ignore pain "next massive damage". Buff consumed on next inc damage ? "Random aoe" can waste it ?
Ignore Pain ignores 90% of the next X damage you take, from any sources. It lasts until you take a total of X damage. WarcraftDevs 
what is the variable "x" in this situation?
It's 25% of your maximum health. So if you have 400k health, X = 100k. WarcraftDevs 
Example: Boss deals 50k, 25k, 50k. You take 5k X=50k left, 2.5k X=25k left, 27.5k affected first 25k, then fell off. WarcraftDevs 
So warriors are going to have incredibly smooth damage intake. Feeling underwhelmed by protadin announcement.
I'm trying to help clarify things as much as possible... Could you help me understand what led you to that conclusion? Celestalon 
Ignore Pain kicks in only on heavy damage attacks and reduces them significantly, effectively mitigating the largest damage 1/2
Ah, this is more fallout from the confusing wording of Ignore Pain then. No, that's not what it does. See blog and clarifications. Celestalon 
What I'm lacking understanding on is, if you take a 1mil hit and you have 400k hp, is 90% of 100k reduced or 90% of 1mil
90% of 100k. It will absorb 90% of the next 100k that you take. A 1mil hit will do 910k. Celestalon 

Tell my why I shouldn't stand in fire when I am not tanking as prot? It reminds me of vengeance, take damage to do more damage
Your DPS gain would be trivial, and your healers could do significantly more DPS in the time they spend healing you instead. WarcraftDevs 

Will shield slam and revenge be prot warrior's only way to generate rage, because the values seem kinda of low.
Check out the Gameplay section of the blog. Celestalon

Fistweaving and Gladiator Stance
Fistweaving and Gladiator Stance will not be joining us in Legion.

We love the fantasy that each of those “subspecs” promise, but leaving them as subspecs has proven to be problematic, making us unable to properly deliver on their fantasy. Trying to support two different playstyles within one spec restricts how much we can focus and bring out the strengths of either of them. We still love both of their concepts, however, and will look for opportunities to bring them back in the future.

Fistweaving in particular ended up being used mostly as a mana management tool to support Serpent Stance, instead of a damage/heal hybrid, which didn’t support its fantasy well. While we recognize that the initial goal for Mistweaver Monk -- combining a ranged healer with a melee healing style -- attracted some people to the class, quite a few things have changed since then. Most importantly, there’s been a huge shift away from smart heals in Warlords, which is continuing in Legion.

Mistweaver gameplay for most players was centered around their ranged healing spells, and our focus for the spec in 7.0 consists of reinforcing their unique array of healing tools and adding talents and artifact powers that support this style.

Soon. Muffinus 

Classes
I like the general feel of the rotations, but what about the CCs? Are they being baked into Talents? PVP Prestige?
The blogs are only covering core combat abilities. There will still be baseline CC, and potentially more via talents and PvP. WarcraftDevs 

Hey guys, have you considered making mana scale again like it used to? And not a base amount that never changes?
We want to make sure that mana remains a meaningful constraint throughout the expansion. Gear is not likely to scale mana pools. WarcraftDevs 

For alts, will there be a way to just take all passive talents?
Nearly every talent row will have a passive option. WarcraftDevs 

With classes being reworked, will we have more abilities on our bars, less, or around the same amount?
For many specs, the answer will be "either less or more, depending on which talents you pick." WarcraftDevs 

I'm curious why some times class consistency is good soul shards and other times its not holy power 
Great question! It's important that the resource itself has strong fantasy, and that it also brings strong gameplay. WarcraftDevs 

Roughly how many talent rows will we have access to in Legion, if I may ask?
7 rows, plus PvP talents. Also, the game has far more total talents due to having many more spec-specific options!  WarcraftDevs 

Character / Items
How are we already back at items with +1k points of a stat? That stat squish didn't seem to last a single expansion.
We would've been well into 5 digits by now otherwise. It was a temporary realignment, not a permanent end to scaling. WatcherDev 

Super excited to see how Artifacts are coming along. Cannot wait to spew feedback during Beta -- Cap on Artifact per week?
There are some caps on spending deep in to prevent potential hard grinding. We'll have more details to share later. WarcraftDevs 

Artifact transmog: will we be able to, eg. mog Icebringer different from Soulreaper? Sorry if already answered, haven't seen.
Yes, mainhand and offhand will remain separately transmogrifiable. WarcraftDevs 

Will artifacts be transmoggable between weapon types? ie fist weapons transmogged to maces?
You will be able to transmogrify your Artifact to look like a different weapon, following the normal transmog rules. WarcraftDevs 

Can you expand on alts getting artifacts? Will we be able to experience the story lore of all spec artifacts on one char?
Yep! You can do the artifact quest lines for all of a character's available specs. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
With the introduction of a PvP talent system, are the normal talents still active in PvP areas?
yes holinka 

Any word on racials in PVP? I'm assuming they're removed in RBG and arena, because trinkets and enchants are removed.
Racials, Talents, Artifact Traits, and of course PvP talents will all be active in both unrated and rated PvP. WarcraftDevs 
this includes world pvp, right? And duels?
Yes, this includes world PvP and duels. WarcraftDevs 

Lore
Can I ask you a little lore question? What is the relation between mana, arcane and chi/life? Is mana any different from chi?
An upcoming book will detail these and other fundamental forces! Arcane is a fundamental power, "Mana" is just a measure of it. DaveKosak 
"Chi" is a Pandaren term for "Spirit," the primal life force that shaman tap into. DaveKosak 

Hi, . Like other Paladins, must Blood Knights have faith in the Light to use it, or CAN they just take it from the Sunwell? TY
technically they can take it but Liadrin has moved the blood knights away from that type of abuse of the Light. Abrosiabi 

what about Illidan. You almost didn't say anything about him at the panels . What's his status? Is he hiding/plotting something
long storyline throughout whole expansion. Patience please Abrosiabi 

Green dragons were immortal until the events of Cataclysm and the unmaking of Deathwing, as I understand it. DaveKosak 
Slight error Mr. Kosak. All dragons were mortal before Cataclysm, just long lived. The Aspects, alone, were immortal
Yes! Thank you. DaveKosak 

Hi, . Like other Paladins, must Blood Knights have faith in the Light to use it, or CAN they just take it from the Sunwell? TY
To wield the Light as a weapon takes intense focus and a VERY powerful belief. Power isn't stolen the way Warlocks take it DaveKosak 
What? That directly conflicts with the BK's origin of stealing power from M'uru, and the AskCDev answer about it.
Question was about present day and Sunwell. DaveKosak 

Any chance the habit of locking big lore moments behind mythic raidng can stop? Lore nerds are not Raiders and vice versa usually
Well, by definition raid fights and their result HAVE to be important for lore. LFR is there to ensure everyone can see it! DaveKosak 
That said the Lore of Legion's Raids R making me 4 the first time want to seriously try Raids maybe I am contradicting myself lol
Flexible raiding makes it much easier to get involved. Find a fun guild - raiding is VERY fun! DaveKosak 

UI / Addons
Are there any plans on having a built-in option to track debuffs on nameplates without extra addons?
We're experimenting with ways to show some debuffs such as DoTs on nameplates. Beta feedback will be invaluable! WarcraftDevs 

Reputation / Questing
A little confused on zone scaling in Legion. If lvl 102 and lvl 108 players group together, what do mobs scale to?
The way it works, it acts like a 102 to the 102 and a 108 to the 108. It's seamless enough that you don't need to worry about it. WarcraftDevs 

Misc
What does everyone think? 3 day BlizzCon? I doubt I would survive. DaveKosak 

But there are now so many happy little trees
It's actually a problem game designers face. "We like this thing, give us more of this thing until we don't like it!" holinka
