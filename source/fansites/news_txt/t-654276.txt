Mimiron Hard Mode Nerfed
In the past hours a lot of people have reported major changes to the hard mode version of Mimiron See this post  So far it looks like the changes are:

Emergency Mode  has been reduced to 25%. 
The damage of Plasma Blast  has been reduced. 
The damage of Heat Wave  has been reduced.
Emergency Bots in Phase 3 no longer have a silence aura in 10-man. 

Don't hesitate to post in comments if you have a few more details on that nerf.
