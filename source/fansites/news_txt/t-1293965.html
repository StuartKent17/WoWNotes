Patch 5.3 - Heirloom Shields<br>
Patch 5.2 added two new Heirloom shields to the game, but there were some issues with them and they never were added to vendors. <br>
<br>
It appears the issues have been resolved, and we will see http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/93903.jpg Weathered Observer&apos;s Shield (http://www.wowdb.com/items/93903-weathered-observers-shield) and http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/93902.jpg Flamescarred Draconian Deflector (http://www.wowdb.com/items/93902-flamescarred-draconian-deflector) in Patch 5.3 at the cost of 2175 Justice Points.<br>

Ghostcrawler on Tri Spec<br>
It appears uniqueness is part of the reason we won&apos;t be seeing Tri Spec (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/march/ThirdSpec.png) in Patch 5.3.<br>

Stack ranking healers based on meters is like stack ranking cars based on max speed. It doesn&apos;t tell the whole story. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/328220602638942208))<br>

Are you guys really okay with months of LFR becoming useless by Valor Gear? All that time spent on gear is wasted.<br>
Aren&apos;t you always replacing your gear every few months though? What is the specific valor concern? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327542805033525250))<br>
<br>
What&apos;s diff between reason Blizz used 4 shared lock-out vs. normal raiders feel complld to do normal+LFR each week?<br>
Why do you run LFR as a N raider? What is there for you? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325342066139860992))<br>
Valor Points. At our current progression we are still scrapping for any source of upgrade. Plus the SP-A rep to buy.<br>
You won&apos;t get additional rep for doubling up, but if you are on e.g. 3rd boss in N then it might make sense to do the rest in LFR. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325380040051261440))<br>
To be fair, that&apos;s fairly min-max behavior. If you&apos;re on 3rd boss on N, a couple more valor pieces isn&apos;t what&apos;s holding you back. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325380256229896193))<br>
Normal Raiders feel the LFR mandatory cus of the stuff. LFR ToT stuff ilvl should be = to 489 to prevent that.<br>
If you&apos;re a N raider, you are earning 522+ ilevel. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325382465864736768))<br>
If you don&apos;t have much 522 because you&apos;re stuck on an early boss, then getting a few 502 probably isn&apos;t what&apos;s blocking you. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325382667862413313))<br>
If you like earning ilevel as fast as possible, by all means go for it, but I wouldn&apos;t consider it mandatory. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325382772493520896))<br>
<br>
Didn&apos;t you just hotfix nerf health in Horridon and Sounds like a gear issue to me. Those weren&apos;t mechanic nerfs.<br>
We don&apos;t make fights that are target dummies. Nerfing numbers means you can afford more mistakes on the mechanics. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325404609424285696))<br>
As I said, if improving gear is fun for you, that&apos;s great. Just don&apos;t obsess unnecessarily over marginal ilevel improvements. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325404827528077312))<br>
<br>
We need Normal tuned down. The amount of non heroic guilds finishing Nrrmals in time is negligible<br>
We&apos;re happy with N difficulty for 25. It was a little hard for 10s, but we made some fixes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325341120282386432))<br>
<br>
for &apos;real&apos; raiders progression is the motivation. raiding for loot is an outdated vanilla attitude.<br>
That hasn&apos;t been our experience. Raiding is fun, but becomes less so the moment you stop getting rewards. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325307703071236097))<br>
<br>
What&apos;s with the can&apos;t release spirit until whole raid whipes mechanic? I find it kinda annoying I wish I knew why it was there<br>
It solved a whole lot of problems where players wouldn&apos;t get credit or loot if they released before a kill. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325307384320892928))<br>
<br>
I&apos;d always thought testing times are based on when you guys can get all *your* hands on deck to observe, no?<br>
There&apos;s an element of that for sure. Being on the west coast doesn&apos;t always work to our advantage. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325032929992507393))<br>
If you&apos;re a two-night-a-week guild, are you going to sacrifice one of those just to help us out? I mean we appreciate it for sure. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325028945974161410))<br>
My point was we get a lot of testing by heroic raiders. It&apos;s harder for normal raiders to justify spending the time. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325028822175064064))<br>
<br>
It would have to be a sizable reward to get me to leave my guild groups for the thankless world of pug tanking.<br>
We really don&apos;t want you to do that. I fundamentally believe WoW is more fun with friends than solo. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324701285473480704))<br>
Hard to believe that, when raid tuning means either settle for LFR or ditch underperforming friends.<br>
Would you be satisfied if you could run Raid Finder with just your friends? Or is your expectation to run an easier ver of normal? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325032623074320385))<br>
<br>
What if..... you didn&apos;t change the ilvl or stats on LFR gear ,but made the gear blue quality.<br>
A whole lot of players use LFR. We want to preserve the prestige of N and H raiding, but don&apos;t want to push folks out of LFR. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325029986446749696))<br>
<br>
in ToT almost every encounter has a tank swap based on a debuff stack, are we gonna see different mechanics in the next tier?<br>
If we can come up with good ones. We (and tanks) soured on the &quot;soak up the cleave&quot; mechanic. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325028256287969280))<br>
<br>
I get bored whenever I feel I can&apos;t progress, be it gear or stuck on a boss or whatnot.<br>
Frustration at lack of progression is a common problem. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325004829191720960))<br>
However, it happens when players can&apos;t kill a boss and also when they kill everything and run out of content. No progress. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325004939623550977))<br>
<br>
Actually you can force. Called remove LFG/LFR and you&apos;ll see &apos;communities/interaction&apos; occur instantly.<br>
Er, for some players, sure. Others just log off when they can&apos;t get a group. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324707938612686848))<br>
I had friends and still sat in chat for 2h looking for Arcatraz pugs. Not the best of times. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324708030291783681))<br>
<br>
why is mob tagging still in the game? surely fostering co-operation is a good thing?<br>
It is, but tabbing SW:Pain on every mob in a zone isn&apos;t our idea of cooperation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/326448031295733761))<br>
<br>
GC, will we ever see a return to the way VPs were awarded thru heroics in WotLK? Some people can&apos;t log in every day!<br>
You can keep running dungeons on the days you can log in. You keep getting valor beyond the first run. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327957409437986817))<br>
In the DS model, 7 runs capped you. Now, takes 18 runs if you do 1 per day, and 1 more run per missed day.<br>
Fewer players capped when it was 7 a day. Totally understand that that model worked better for some players. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/328226842635018240))<br>
<br>
What is your design for PvE set bonuses? Stronger as tiers progress? Or just fun bonuses, should people have 4pc or offpieces?<br>
I personally like the idea that off pieces can be competitive, but it&apos;s a hard sell to many players (and some designers). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327878152779083776))<br>
I know that for throne of thunder with thunderforged pieces alot of people will be dropping tier pieces for BiS thunderforged.<br>
I think that&apos;s kind of cool rather than tunneling in on set pieces only, but we&apos;ll see how it feels in a few more weeks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327882061979480064))<br>
Why do we even have off-set pieces? So that armor looks different? But all offset match set artistically anyway.<br>
One reason is players like to match their gear (easier with transmog now). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/328225418945650688))<br>
Another is that raid quality armor takes about a month for an artist to make and we make 22 (including PvP) plus weapons. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/328225711930372096))<br>
<br>
Challenge mode was the biggest waste of resources, unpopular, unappealing, not worth it. Scrap it.<br>
Disagree. It&apos;s more popular than expected and I personally find it a ton of fun. It&apos;s cool to use all your abilities for a change. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327876034403893248))<br>

Exodus Done With 25 Man Raiding<br>
Late last week Killars posted an interesting message (https://www.facebook.com/Killarslol/posts/572309812789070) as to why Exodus (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/mal-ganis/Exodus) is done raiding. They ended up in 8th place in Tier 15, down from 6th place in Tier 14. <br>
<br>
Yes, I&apos;ll confirm the news here for anyone not in the loop or questioning the rumors. &lt;Exodus&gt; will no longer continue to function as a 25 man raiding guild. No plan to go 10 man as of yet, but that really doesn&apos;t matter because 25 man is what the hardcore raiding scene really is about and Exodus will no longer be competing in such a scene.<br>
<br>
Why? How? Well this game isn&apos;t to blame. In the last few years this game (despite many people quitting and guilds dying) isn&apos;t to blame for vodka/Exodus&apos; demise it&apos;s the raiding community. I don&apos;t mean this is a pointing the finger sort of way, it&apos;s an inevitable sort of flaw in the competition of the top end raiders. You see... we&apos;ve basically been killing ourselves off slowly since day 1. <br>
<br>
In the last few years we&apos;ve certainly picked up the pace, but the &quot;hardcore raider&quot; is a dying breed and it&apos;s certainly becoming a more difficult breed to be a part of. What I mean by this is of course the time commitment and the level of shear dedication and determination it takes and costs to be at the very top. This isn&apos;t to poke fun, but to just shed light of why many people, and subsequently, many guilds will fall. Raiding for many many hours on end is fun, CAN be exciting, and at the end of it all can really prove who really wants that world first/us first/realm first the most. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately we (hardcore raiders) pushed too hard. Tier after tier we just keep adding to the insanity in both farming preparations and actual progressing. It&apos;s almost as if progression itself never really ends after a end tier boss dies. Combine this with Blizzard actually putting new content out faster, alts playing a big role, PTR/BETA, dailys, coins, BMAH, well... you just get lost in it all. Right now there are a few legit world first guilds left. The competition is slim because the competition is literally eating each other (well not that literally). Good luck to everyone left in the race for this expac, but I don&apos;t know how much longer this sort of thing can last.<br>
