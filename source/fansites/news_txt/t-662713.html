The map I used is just a 1680x1050 screenshot of the in-game map and it looks exactly like the one used on SoundBlaster.com<br>

WoW Teaser on Soundblaster.com<br>
A new teaser appeared on the front page of SoundBlaster.com (http://www.soundblaster.com/). For the moment it&apos;s just a blinking horde logo with the Lament of the Highborne (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/downloads/movies.html#lament) playing in the background. I don&apos;t think Blizzard would announce anything important through another site and it&apos;s most likely just a nice way to release a new piece of hardware but we&apos;ll keep an eye on it anyway.<br>
