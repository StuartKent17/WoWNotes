Terrace of Endless Spring
Hidden high in the mountains, the Terrace of Endless Spring is the sacred center of the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Its peaceful fountains are said to have the power to heal and rejuvenate, but when the Sha of Fear attacked, many of the complex's guardians turned on each other in fits of terror.

Achievements

Heroic: Lei Shi  - Defeat Lei Shi in Terrace of Endless Spring on Heroic difficulty.
Face Clutchers  - Defeat Lei Shi while all members of the raid are afflicted by Parasitic Clutch in Terrace of Endless Spring on Normal or Heroic difficulty.


Lei Shi

<img src="" title="Important" /> Afraid  - Lei Shi grows more afraid as players hurt her. She gains 1% casting speed for each 1 percent health of her total health lost.
<img src="" title="Tank" /> Spray  - Lei Shi casts Spray instead of using melee attacks. Spray causes water to burst from the ground at a player's feet, inflicting 104,000-218,400 Frost damage to all players within 2.5 yards and increasing their Frost damage taken by 10% for 15 sec.
Hide  - Lei Shi hides from players. Players cannot target her while hiding, but area of effect attacks and spells can still hit her. Lei Shi reveals herself after the players strike her enough times.
Get Away!  - Lei Shi channels the waters of the Endless Spring, pushing players away and inflicting 60,000 periodic Frost damage. Players who fight the current take half damage. Lei Shi channels for 30 sec or until players inflict 5% of her maximum health in damage.
Protect  - Lei surrounds herself with an inpenetrable bubble and animates several elementals to protect her. She maintains the bubble until players defeat one of her Animated Protectors.

<img src="" title="Tank" /> Animated Protector - When Lei Shi casts Protect, she animates these elementals from the bracers scattered throughout the area. The elementals turn back into water and fall to the ground when the effect ends.

<img src="" title="Heroic" /> <img src="" title="Important" /> Scary Fog  - Sha energy coalesces around several players, inflicting 5,000 Shadow damage every 2 sec. for 40 sec. In addition, players and enemies near an afflicted player take 5% more damage from all sources. This effect stacks.




Wild Pet Trading Removed
Keep in mind that you can still level a pet and then sell it, as long as it wasn't caught from the wild. 
We just finished a pass making all pets that are caught via pet battles in the world non-tradeable. This means these pets cannot be put in cages for trading or posting on the AH. We felt that the option to buy these pets on the AH would take away from the exploration/collection gameplay of the system.

This could always change in a future patch, but this is how it will go out with MoP. You should see the change in our next build.


Beta Class Balance Analysis
Since everyone is thinking it, I'll ask...what should we read into the fact that you, and not GC, is now responding to posts in this forum?
That I’m not as busy as others are right now which is a terrible understatement.

Back in the Black Wing Decent and Bastion of Twilight myself and a few friends of mine discovered that dots already on the target don't actually get re-evaluated when their caster receives a large haste boosts such as heroism and time-warp. This forces you to reapply your dots so that their period of ticking is shortened by the haste gain.

As you can probably tell this is quite a hassle. Especially as an Aff lock with mucho spell haste procs. Is this still the case?
Yes. The parameters of a DoT are determined at cast time. This may be a good time to explain one related topic though: Refreshing DoTs and whether that recalculates their parameters. For several classes, we have various mechanics that allow you to refresh or extend an existing DoT. In some of these cases, doing so recalculates their parameters; in other cases, it does not. Why the inconsistency, you ask? The rule we follow is that if the mechanic allows you to perpetually extend one DoT forever, it needs to recalculate. If it isn’t intended to let you maintain one DoT forever, it doesn’t need to recalculate. For example, the Demonology warlock's spell Touch of Chaos extends Corruption significantly, and it’s quite likely you’ll roll one corruption the whole fight, so it then recalculates. Alternatively, there’s a new mechanic coming for Affliction where Haunt adds 1 tick to each of your DoTs when it hits; that does not recalculate damage.

GC, just a quick clarification. The new Armor Damage Reduction formula used for 86+ characters: Armor / Armor + 4,037.5 * Level - 31,7117.5 Does this continue on to level 93, similarly how the current Cata formula worked to 88 until this expansion? or is there another formula for level 91 and beyond?
It continues on to level 93. Just to clarify to make sure there are no misunderstandings, adding denotation for which variables are of the target and which are of the attacker: DamageReduction = TargetArmor / TargetArmor + 4037.5*AttackerLevel – 317117.5.

 Monk Forums 
Currently Rushing Jade Wind is causing 6sec shuffle for each target it hits. given the cap on shuffle is 12sec, it basically means you get 12 sec shuffle if you cast on more than 1 mob.
This is something we're keeping an eye on for balance problems but for now, this is intended. There is a chance we may change it in the future.

Still on lvl 90 talents for monks, whats the intent on Xuen tiger?
Xuen does indeed cause Eminence for Mistweavers and is purely DPS for Windwalkers. For Brewmasters, he has a provoke, not a taunt. Provokes are what we normally give pets and they work like taunts but don’t work on most bosses. For example, Army of the Dead ghouls have a provoke. He should be decent at tanking and scales with your stats, the hope being he is useful as an off-tank. However, he won't be able to tank a raid boss since he has a provoke, not a taunt, but he should be able to tank some adds and dungeon mobs. Please try that out and let us know how he does.

 Paladin Forums 
Is it intended for Judgment to no longer apply/refresh Censure anymore? If so why was that change made?
Yes, Judgement has had quite the long history and has been a relatively unique ability since its inception. It's been a mix between a ‘ranged’ type attack or a ‘spell’, or for most of the past few years it’s been a ‘melee’ attack with a long range. That’s why it triggered Censure. But it also shared a bunch of properties with spells. So, for Mists, we decided to finally make it consistent with everything else and just say that it’s purely a spell, just as much as Exorcism or Holy Shock are spells.

 Shaman Forums 
Is it intended for Healing Tide Totem to act as healing done by the shaman, or as a separate entity to avoid being split by AscendanceResto as its currently not being duplicated and divided.
Intended. Totems' actions don't count as the shaman's. This is consistent with Searing Bolt not triggering Echo of the Elements and other similar effects.

Pets are currently not taking bonus health from Ancestral Vigor from what I can see. They're receiving the buff but not gaining any maximum health.
We plan to fix this in a future build. Currently, pet scaling from your own health is overwriting buffs. We plan to fix this. This would also affect Glyph of Water Elemental, by the way.

 Warlock Forums 
Windwalk Totem currently does not prevent warlocks from becoming snared via KJ Cunning. Is this intended or bugged?
Fixed in the next build.

Alternatively, there’s a new mechanic coming for Affliction where Haunt adds 1 tick to each of your DoTs when it hits; that does not recalculate damage.
I wanted to post a correction on this part. Our design process is very iterative and we’re constantly trying out new things. The above mentioned mechanic for Haunt extending DoTs is something we’ve been trying internally, but have decided not to go with for now, so don’t expect to see it in a future build.

Upcoming Pet Battle Changes
Many changes have been ongoing with the quests. Our next build should have significant updates.

A few highlights on what we have been working on:

Unique Tamer emotes Unique Tamer pets Tamer battles have been tuned up in difficulty One Grand Master Tamer per continent. Defeating him/her will unlock all the daily's on that continent. The flow has been consolidated to work though our two main trainers in Stormwind and Orgrimmar. We have implemented more than 40 Tamer fights across the entire game. This does not include the boss fights! Daily quests on Grand Master Tamers offer the Sack of Pet Supplies as a reward. A new achievement reward for defeating all the Tamers. A "Tamer" title. All of the quests to fight Tamers are now account-wide. This means that the one-shot quests can only be completed by one character on your account. The daily's can be completed by any character, once per day. Account wide quests are denoted in the quest log.

Warbot Fuel
There will be a way to get Warbot fuel in MoP. Still figuring out the specifics, but we are going to make it happen. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Remove 'Safe Zones' from PvP Servers
We feel it is rather necessary that the starter areas remain uncontested territory, as it gives newcomers a better chance to get a feel for the game and learn how it works... people need a chance to tie their boots before they get their faces smashed in :- 

We acknowledge that the pursuit of good world PvP can make the line between griefing and PvP quite blurry, and that is very much a part of the game which seasoned PvP players are fairly used to. But it is not fun to be new to a game, or re-rolling a new character for that matter, if you can’t even leave the starter area because some enemy faction player is corpse-camping or ganking everyone and everything in sight.

i heard you're going to try get us more involved with wpvp in mop but how will that change with the current dungeon/bg systems? wont people still just afk in sw/org in wait for their stuff to pop up?
We are indeed trying to get people more involved with world-PvP in Mists of Pandaria.

We are trying to provide a greater incitement for people to go back into the world by offering more content to do outside of the cities - this combined with cross realm zones means that you should come across more peopleincluding enemy players in the world overall. Additionally - the guards on PvP realms will be nerfed, so bashing in some skulls inside enemy towns and cities should be more feasible as well.

Is there any info about how much weaker the guards on PvP realms will be, compared to the ones on PvE realms?
I'm afraid I have no info available on this as of yet, but I can imagine that it will be something that may need a few adjustments over time anyway. The guards still need to matter and have some ability to protect the citizens of towns and cities, so they shouldn't be complete pushovers, but they also shouldn't be a near invincible army as they are today. 

The plans are to adjust the guards on PvP realms so they are less strong than those found on PvE realms, and they will also take longer to respawn than those on PvE realms. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Importance of Beta Testing
May I field you a quick question? When Cata & D3 came out the servers were heavily fluxed with players, down time and angry mobs of people in a certain nation we will not mention... my question is have the errors of the past been noted and improved on ?
We have been rather overwhelmed in the past with more players than anticipated logging in upon release, but have taken note of past launch experiences indeed, and we will of course do everything we can to improve ourselves. More than anyone, we would like a smooth launch, and we want people to be happy and have fun when they log in after release. 

I'm just wondering if the stuff reported in the beta really gets noticed...:-/. I've been reporting bugs like a woman crazed, but I guess those bugs are not "important" enough for recognition since they still are left unfixed. Namely visual bugs and such.
All reported bugs that can be verified and reproduced of course, do get noticed and put on a list of things to fix. However it can take some time before they get fixed, as some bugs are more difficult to handle than others, and the less severe bugs do not have as high a priority as the really critical ones... I hope this makes sense to you. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
