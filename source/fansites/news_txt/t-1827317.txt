WoW Americas Regionals $100,000 Prize Pool
Two teams have already qualified for the World of Warcraft Arena Americas Regionals later this year – one from North America, and one from Australia & New Zealand. As we wait to learn who will be joining them from the Latin American Championship and North American Cups 2 and 3, we wanted to take a moment to share some exciting news about the Americas Regionals prizing!

This year, teams who advance to the Americas Regionals won’t just be competing to earn a spot at BlizzCon, they’ll also be fighting for a share of an epic prize pool of $100,000. That prize money will be distributed among the 8 qualifying teams as follows:

1st place team: $50,000 2nd place team: $20,000 3rd place team: $10,000 4th place team: $8,000 5th-6th place teams: $4,000 7th-8th place teams: $2,000 

We’re extremely excited about this year’s Road to BlizzCon, and can’t wait to share all of the details on the Americas Regionals including when and where they’ll be happening with you soon. Good luck to everyone competing!


Recent PvP Rewards Hotfix
Looks like both changes made it in for maintenance today. All of the Wild Gladiator's armor pieces should now be available on the Conquest vendors, and there is no longer a 200-point Ashran restriction on the weekly Conquest cap.

So, slightly technical details here, but for those who are asking:

The issue with the Accolade trinkets is that there's actually just one item per primary stat Strength, Agility, etc, which has a secondary stat randomly assigned when it's looted. We can't, for example, put the Int/Versatility trinket on a vendor, because that item doesn't actually exist -- there's just an Int trinket that can randomly have Versatility added to it.

This means we don't have a way to implement a non-random method to get them via hotfix. We'd need to add new versions of the trinkets to the game, and that requires a content patch. I don't know yet if that can happen in time for 6.2.1.
