In the upcoming pre-Warlords of Draenor content patch, we&#x2019;re adding a new feature that allows players to undelete characters. But before you delete that character, there are a few limitations we want you to let you to know about first.<br>
<br>
<br>
Characters under level 10 and Death Knights at level 55 are not eligible to be undeleted.<br>
Characters between level 10 and level 29 will no longer recoverable after 90 days.<br>
Characters between level 30 and 49 will no longer recoverable after 120 days.<br>
All other characters level 50 and above are eligible to be undeleted at any time.<br>
Please keep in mind you will only be able to use the undelete option once every 30 days.<br>
<br>
<br>
Undeleting a character restores all of its enchantments, gems, and items fully intact. You&#x2019;ll be able to get back into action right away, and your character won&#x2019;t remember being deleted&#x2014;we won&#x2019;t tell, either.<br>
<br>
Shhhh. . . .<br>

Reclaiming Your Name: What About Flugur?<br>
We&#x2019;ll be holding deleted character names for a limited time, and the original creator can reclaim it for use on a new character during that time. If you create a new character with the same name as one of your deleted characters (let&#x2019;s say Flugur), the new character must be renamed, transferred, or deleted to complete the restoration of the original Flugur.</div></div>
