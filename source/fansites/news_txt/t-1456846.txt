The Scroll of Resurrection Retires
The time has come to bid adieu to the Scroll of Resurrection. It’s served its divine purpose, but like most scrolls, it only has so many charges before it loses its magic and crumbles into ethereal dust. For those who’d still like a chance to use the scroll, you have until February 18 before players are no longer able to send invitations. For those who have an invitation outstanding, that’s still good for 30 days from the time it was sent, after which point the invitation will expire and the benefits can no longer be claimed.

For additional information on the Scroll of Resurrection, please visit our FAQ. https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/scroll-of-resurrection-faq


Battle.Net Launcher Update
The Battle.Net Launcher was recently updated to add support for Warlords of Draenor.
