The existing PvP realms all now have either a Full or High population tag. With the potential for extended queues on the Full realms, and 10,000+ queues on Shazzrah, we are opening another English PvP realm on Tuesday, August 20 at 8:00 p.m. CEST:


Firemaw – PvP – English


We urge players on PvP realms to consider moving to this realm. Doing so will help spread the player population as evenly as possible before launch and provide the best play experience for everyone.

Worgen and Goblin Heritage Armor Update
Worgen & Goblin Heritage Armor?
I certainly hope we’re getting Worgen and Goblin Heritage sets in a future patch
We are getting Worgen and Goblin Heritage armor questlines in a future content update.

We think it’s really cool to have these memorable questing experiences that go along with and encapsulate the moment when you inherit your Heritage armor. We’re working on bringing them to the game as soon as we can.
