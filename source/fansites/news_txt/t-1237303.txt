Ghostcrawler Interview
Today's interview is with Ghostcrawler on Wowjuju http://www.wowjuju.com/_/wowarticles/exclusive-interview-with-greg-street-r277. A summary of the main points is below, but reading the full interview is worth it if you want to see the full answers!

Future patches will keep the number of daily quests added more reasonable, similar to the amount added in Patch 5.1.
Having a queue and audience for the Brawler's Guild makes it more exciting; it isn't something that you are supposed to rush through. You get priority in the queue if you haven't done a battle yet for the day as well.
Unless you are one of the higher end raiders, you may not feel that upgrading all of your gear is worth the effort, and that is okay. Upgrading is another way to provide progression throughout the expansion. 
The 10 / 25 man changes in Asia aren't a test for the US / EU realms, just a response to what players there want. No one wants to see 25 player raiding disappear though. 
Main-hand and off-hand items will be allowed to be transmogrified with each other, as well as any weapons that use the same animation. Things like staves and polearms, the one handed axes, maces and swords, and the two handed axes, maces and swords. 
Golden Lotus being required for other reputations was a way to reduce the amount of daily quests that were initially available to players. 
Horde racials are likely better than Alliance racials for PvE right now. Only the top guilds have switched for the racials, but if more guilds do so then the racials will be adjusted. 
Players can expect for Wrathion to call upon them during every patch in this expansion in return for increasingly more powerful rewards.

PvP CC Feedback
First things first, I want to make sure you’re aware that the information below reflects both short and long-term design considerations on our end. This isn’t all on the table for patch 5.2 for a number of reasons.

To make this clear right off the bat: This shift of instant casts back to cast times is not just targeted at crowd control. We also wish to start moving some heals back to having a cast time rather than being instant. That said, we’re not necessarily planning on overhauling many of the spells and abilities that have been instant for a long time now, such as Hand of Justice. We’re looking at some of the big outliers that we see brought up a lot, which are instant-cast, area-of-effect abilities like Blinding Light, or Presence of Mind in combination with Ring of Frost. 

We think that there are too many of these AoE CC spells at this time, especially instant AoE CC, which can create some frustrating gameplay experiences. Some other particular crowd-control effects that are on our radar are abilities like Blood Fear, which we’re considering redesigning altogether, and Predatory Swiftness in combination with Cyclone, which feels virtually impossible to counter.

While we are talking about cc what about having some more spells share DR with each other. A pala can repentance/blinding light/ hammer. No Dr at all. Why is it that fear and blind share a DR and polly/fear and cycone dont? and many more examples like this. 
We’re looking at diminishing returns for CC right now as a possible way to help with CC in PvP combat, but it’s the type of gameplay overhaul that can be risky to implement in the middle of an expansion cycle if the change is too drastic. We are, however, taking a look right now at the DRs within particular classes, as well as special snowflakes like Cyclone. Either way, the design discussion will undoubtedly continue!

Pandaria Pet Battle Daily Quest Bug
If you’re encountering issues with obtaining the Pandaria Pet Battle dailies, the Grand Master Aki quest chain, or the Pandaren Spirit Tamer quest started by Sara Finkleswith for the Alliance or Gentle San for the Horde, there is a workaround that we’ve had some success with. 

Abandon all Pet Battle related quests and restart the Pet Tamer quest chain from the beginning Audrey Burhep for the Alliance in Stormwind or Varzok for the Horde in Orgrimmar. This issue could be caused by making Pet Battle quest progress on multiple characters at the same time, and so we strongly recommend sticking with one character until the end to try to avoid encountering the issue again. 

We realize the workaround isn’t ideal, and we’re continuing to investigate the cause. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/247841-blocked-in-pandaria/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7320422534?page=1#8


Blue Tweets
PvE
How can we expect ilvl upgrading to affect the tuning of future raid tiers?
Philosophically we want raids to be more about progression and less about instant catch up. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274003101369892864
Going back to the old model where you have to progress linear through the raids from release of current expac?
That's the plan. We have older Raid Finder tiers now to provide the necessary gear. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274016574480990209

Appreciate Lesser Charms move 2 currency but 5.1 has filled that bag slot w Commndtions. Any chance they move to currency too?
We wanted you to be able to loot them from players, which currency can't do yet. In the future we should be able to. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274177335874424833

What about people that want to raid but don't want to deal with dailies? Add other ways to get charms pls.
You can raid without charms. You will gear up faster with charms, which seems fine: you can choose to play more or less. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273165615437582337

Using multiple charms on the same boss per week in lfr by repeated q'ing intended or bug? Same chance every time?
we're fine with it. You'll eventually run out of charms. Same chance every time. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273170572186374144
Will that also worlk on world bosses like Sha of Anger and Galleon?
Not on Sha. When we made him spawn regularly, we didn't think infinite Charms made sense any longer. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273610177939398657

Haven't killed Galloen yet on my server. Horde camp, etc. GMs considered a month-long guild summoning quest or the like?
G is supposed to be the rare boss that not everyone gets. We learned a lot from him and have changes planned for future bosses. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272796979032109056

What's the limit for players inviting other players in brawlers guild?
I believe we started with 1 invite once you reach high rank. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272066607155658753

Does WoW really need obscure glancing blows and crit supression mechanic? It seems really outdated like resists.
Yeah I could see an argument to phase those out. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/271389638273413120

How come we dont have the random fight in the Jade Temple anymore? The scroll of strife and peril. I miss the alternative boss
It had bugs we couldn't solve. We hope to bring it back. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/269498391447355392

Dont forget to offer alternatives to charms too. Otherwise it would not make sense since dailies would still be required
It's called "bonus roll" for a reason. You don't need it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270636384467951617

PvP
Do you have a stance on people queuing several groups for a random BG and using timing to ensure they end up together?
You mean using a premade to stomp noobs? What do you think? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273996272371896320

Does Blizzard have plans to clean up CC a little? Getting stunned, feared, again and again can get a bit frustrating.
Most people don't want their CC nerfed, just the other guy. DRs might be a place to look though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274018280811929600
How would you feel about a bar that fills up and once its full you cant CC that player until its empty?
That's kind of like having one DR maybe with more variation than just 50% but we've considered it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274022640140816384

in the future, any plans for total revamp of pvp? i.e. get rid of arena/RBGin current form and implement new pvp structure?
We rarely scrap features and start over. We usually iterate towards what are we hope! stronger designs. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273165842651439104

The "PVE vs. PVP issue" is frequently misunderstood and over exaggerated. A balance scapegoat.
Agree. Players would still be mad if we didn't change X, but they wouldn't have a reason for why we didn't change X. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273179305591328768

Idea was: skills remain the same in both contexts; only changes in metrics are isolated. + Less testing. 
We do that though. Look at PvP Power, CC durations, the healing debuff, etc. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273187728567459840

Very well said, this game should be about constant steady pressure and healing, not burst.
well, burst should be a strategy too, but not the only strategy. PvP is more interesting, we think, when matches vary. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273169439917215744
