Vanilla WoW Developer Interview - John Staats<br>
We recently had the opportunity to talk to John Staats (https://whenitsready.com/) about his ongoing Kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/whenitsready/the-world-of-warcraft-diary-0) for a book about Vanilla WoW development that ends tomorrow!<br>
<br>
The book is now the most funded non fiction book in Kickstarter history. If you are interested in how it was created, there is an article about the book&apos;s creation and approval (https://whenitsready.com/four-developers-how-the-wow-diary-happened/). <br>

WoW Token and The Dreadwake Mount<br>
You won&apos;t get The Dreadwake mount (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8003-Pirate-s-Day-Live-The-Dreadwake-Shop-Mount-Cap-n-Crackers-Shop-Pet) if you convert Tokens into game time.<br>
Hey guys,<br>
<br>
I just wanted to confirm that you would NOT get the Dreadwake mount if you convert your WoW Tokens into game time directly.<br>
<br>
In this case you would need to claim the tokens for balance first and then buy the correct bundle from our shop, here:<br>
https://eu.shop.battle.net/en-gb/product/world-of-warcraft-mount-dreadwake-gametime-bundle<br>
<br>
Hope this helps!<br>
