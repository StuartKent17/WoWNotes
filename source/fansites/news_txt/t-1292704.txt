Patch 5.3 PTR - Build 16896
There was a very minor PTR patch this afternoon, it only had two significant changes, one of them being the addition of the Block Chat Channel Invites option. 

The other change was an increase in the amount of PvP Power Rating needed to get 1% PvP Power from 265 to 400.

There are no easy fixes to low pop relams. We are working on some fixes, but too early to talk about them yet. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325327940743221248

So what you're saying is that it's bad to bench people because you want to stack a class but fine when you want diversity?
We don't want e.g. warlocks to never get brought to a raid. If you are encouraged to bring a mage b/c you have 3 locks, that's fine. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324580994361479168
And in most cases, you could bring 6 locks and still progress. You're less efficient, but not dramatically so. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324581193343434752
My overall advice to most players is to pay more attention to fun and less to efficiency. I predict you will enjoy the game more. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324581341561769984

A lot of people still don't know about changes you guys make, any plans on in-game patch notes?
If they don't read our website why would they read them in game? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322389462250291200

Do you guys have interns programming your tooltips or something? Seems that there are always a TON of "tooltip bugs".
There are just a lot of things that can change a spell's points and the game doesn't know them all innately. We have to fix 'em up. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321770790271987712
We've gotten spell tooltips much more accurate to the point where the inaccuracies jump out now. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321770637335089152
If you look back over the history of WoW, the tooltips were stupidly inaccurate. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321770496876232704

As an artist I can tell 100% that there are more than enough skilled artists with superior quality compared to something
We would love to get more of their resumes. Many artists these days study photo manipulation, but can't always make a good sword. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321319667757101057

You can`t seriously be saying making more content is a problem of there not being enough skilled people in the WORLD to hire?
We haven't interviewed everyone in the world yet. Hiring is a slow process and we are quite picky. We don't hire to fill a quota. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321319277946892288

Curiosity: does Blizzard have a working definition of “casual”? If so, is it more about what you do, or how much you play?
We don't really. Casual is too broad a word. We try to have content aimed at a wide variety of players. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/320299860928651264
I just see a casual gamer as someone who is playing "casually", means on occassion.
There are also very experienced and skilled players who play only rarely. "Casual" doesn't really describe them. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/320343094555967489
Likewise, we have players who play nearly every night, but only to RP and avoid raids or BGs. Not sure they are "casual." Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/320343241096581121
It's just one of those words that isn't precise enough to do the job. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/320343310159970307

Questions about data mined patch notes make you crazy. Confirm or deny ?
Confirm, especially repeated questions that I already addressed. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323149274613436417


Hearthstone Gameplay - Paladin vs Warrior
Another new match, this time between a Paladin and Warrior. You can talk about it in our Hearthstone forum http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/344-Hearthstone-Heroes-of-Warcraft-Online-Cardgame or help out by adding the new cards to the Hearthstone wiki http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Hearthstone_Wiki.
