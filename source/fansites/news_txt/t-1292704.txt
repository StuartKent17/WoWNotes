Patch 5.3 on the Background Downloader
Late this week the launcher started to download ~270 MB of assets for Patch 5.3. It is likely that the patch will be here in a few weeks, but no Release Candidate build yet!


  


Patch 5.3 PTR - Build 16896
There was a very minor PTR patch this afternoon, it only had two significant changes, one of them being the addition of the Block Chat Channel Invites option. 

The other change was an increase in the amount of PvP Power Rating needed to get 1% PvP Power from 265 to 400.

There are no easy fixes to low pop relams. We are working on some fixes, but too early to talk about them yet. Source 

So what you're saying is that it's bad to bench people because you want to stack a class but fine when you want diversity?
We don't want e.g. warlocks to never get brought to a raid. If you are encouraged to bring a mage b/c you have 3 locks, that's fine. Source 
And in most cases, you could bring 6 locks and still progress. You're less efficient, but not dramatically so. Source 
My overall advice to most players is to pay more attention to fun and less to efficiency. I predict you will enjoy the game more. Source 

A lot of people still don't know about changes you guys make, any plans on in-game patch notes?
If they don't read our website why would they read them in game? Source 

Do you guys have interns programming your tooltips or something? Seems that there are always a TON of "tooltip bugs".
There are just a lot of things that can change a spell's points and the game doesn't know them all innately. We have to fix 'em up. Source 
We've gotten spell tooltips much more accurate to the point where the inaccuracies jump out now. Source 
If you look back over the history of WoW, the tooltips were stupidly inaccurate. Source 

As an artist I can tell 100% that there are more than enough skilled artists with superior quality compared to something
We would love to get more of their resumes. Many artists these days study photo manipulation, but can't always make a good sword. Source 

You can`t seriously be saying making more content is a problem of there not being enough skilled people in the WORLD to hire?
We haven't interviewed everyone in the world yet. Hiring is a slow process and we are quite picky. We don't hire to fill a quota. Source 

Curiosity: does Blizzard have a working definition of “casual”? If so, is it more about what you do, or how much you play?
We don't really. Casual is too broad a word. We try to have content aimed at a wide variety of players. Source 
I just see a casual gamer as someone who is playing "casually", means on occassion.
There are also very experienced and skilled players who play only rarely. "Casual" doesn't really describe them. Source 
Likewise, we have players who play nearly every night, but only to RP and avoid raids or BGs. Not sure they are "casual." Source 
It's just one of those words that isn't precise enough to do the job. Source 

Questions about data mined patch notes make you crazy. Confirm or deny ?
Confirm, especially repeated questions that I already addressed. Source 


Hearthstone Gameplay - Paladin vs Warrior
