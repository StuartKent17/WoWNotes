Alpha Realm Maintenance - 12/14<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
What do you say to the ol&apos; 10m guilds that couldn&apos;t (or wouldn&apos;t)recruit 10 more for Mythic and are calling for 10m 2 return?<br>
I was in a 40-person guild, and we had to tell some folks they likely wouldn&apos;t be raiding much. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/674766946634620928))<br>
My point is, it&apos;s hard to give everyone the precise experience they are looking for. But that doesn&apos;t make it easier on them. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/674767131855077378))<br>
<br>
Love Undercity and the ruins of Lordaeron above and Varimathras, Any cool cities that were scrapped? https://t.co/9hz1NMXkPo<br>
As a lover of all things Underdark, I lament that Azjol was reduced to only a couple of dungeons. Maybe someday? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/675135159159660544))<br>

I grew up playing all the &quot;classic&quot; RTS games of the late 90s/early 00&apos;s (AoE, C&amp;C, Starcraft, Warcraft etc.) I have a lot of nostalgia for the genre and I feel like a lot of other people do too. What do you think classic RTS could do, if anything, to make a comeback?<br>
I think you have to ooze charm. I&apos;ll mention Age of Empires, not because I think it&apos;s the best RTS in every aspect, but it did a great job with the charm that hooked people in...<br>
<br>
The fishing villagers carried a giant, flopping fish.<br>
The big cats would sometimes hunt down the gazelle.<br>
It was fun to place the walls around your town.<br>
The priest said Wololo. <br>

Songs of Azeroth<br>
AFK PL@YERS has released a video celebrating the 10th anniversary of WoW Taiwan. You may remember their work from their Blizzcon 2013 winning entry (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMXtMj59Tr4).<br>
