Website Cleanup Incoming
Like any good webmasters, we look at World of Warcraft site stats on a regular basis, and we're always evaluating which aspects of the site people find most useful. Over time, we've identified a few areas that players don't really seem to visit but that still require a bit of effort for us to keep updated each time we release a new content update. For most of these, it's pretty obvious why they don't draw a lot of attention-they tend to focus on things that are simply more compelling to look at inside the game, are a "given," or are already well-served and readily available elsewhere, like on fansites.

Early next week we'll be doing some cleanup and removing the following rarely visited, higher-maintenance sections from the World of Warcraft website:

Game Guide

Pets & Mounts Gallery http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/pet-mount/pet
Factions http://us.battle.net/wow/en/faction/#expansion=4
Professions http://us.battle.net/wow/en/profession/

Guild Profiles
Perks and Rewards sections http://us.battle.net/wow/en/guild/sargeras/Midwinter/perk

Character Profiles
Pets & Mounts http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/scarlet-crusade/Breanni/pet#status=is-collected
Hunter Pets http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/tichondrius/Tosan/hunter-pet#38346
Professions http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/bronzebeard/Nyctelia/profession/inscription
Reputation http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/whisperwind/Moshne/reputation/

Here are just a few fansites that provide a wealth of information on the above topics, as well as a whole lot more! 

Wowhead
Warcraft Pets
Warcraft Mounts
WoW-Petopia

Doesn't WarcraftPets USE the pets section of the armory to update people's collections? You are going to break their site with this decision. Please don't remove the Pet & Mounts section. 
To clarify, this cleanup process shouldn't affect the API fansites and other people use to pull game data.


Flexible Mode Testing - August 9-12
We've unlocked the Underhold wing of the Siege of Orgrimmar Malkorok, Spoils of Pandaria, and Thok the Bloodthirsty for testing over the weekend, continuing into Monday. 

Players with a premade group of between 10 and 25 players can queue using the same interface that you'd use for Dungeons, Scenarios, or LFR. Flexible mode bosses have all the same mechanics as the Normal mode versions, but are otherwise tuned to be more forgiving, and will scale in health and damage output with the number of players in the raid. As you go from a 12-player raid to an 18-player raid, for example, some abilities may affect more targets or hit slightly harder, creatures will have more health, and so forth. Difficulty is almost certainly higher than our final target, but we're probably scaling players down a bit too far for testing right now ilvl 522 for the Underhold wing.

Please provide specific comments and feedback in the dedicated feedback thread.

Combat PvE and Patch 5.4
So, like I mentioned earlier in the thread, we upped the energy cost and damage of Sinister Strike to try to cut back on the spam just slightly. Incidentally, it also helps with the issue of energy capping while both Adrenaline Rush and Shadow Blades are active with the Tier 15 4-piece bonus.

We feel that, with the higher Sinister Strike energy cost in place, we can leave the Tier 15 4-piece as it is. It'll still be a good set bonus, but not quite as good as before, to the point that we don't think it'll have an adverse effect on Tier 16 balance.

Now, I recognize that the general sentiment in this thread seems to disagree with that. Part of why I'm posting this is that I'd like to understand why that is. Keep in mind that this isn't part of balance tuning -- that'll be starting soon, but for the moment we're just trying to get Combat to "feel" right. We're confident that we can make the numbers line up properly with how things are currently functioning on the PTR, but if you disagree, we'd like to know why.

Patch 5.4 PTR - Proving Grounds Bug
We’ve discovered a fairly significant bug that explains why we’ve been seeing such drastically different reports on Proving Grounds difficulty. Simply put, PvP gear is not getting its item level downscaled to 463 the way that PvE gear is; it’s staying at item level 522.

We hope to have this fixed ASAP. In the meantime, if you’re testing out Proving Grounds on the PTR, please try to avoid using PvP gear if at all possible.


The Burdens of Shaohao
Blizzard released http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265688-the-burdens-of-shaohaopart-3-fear/ a six part series that looks at Emperor Shaohao as he progresses toward discovering the truth about his future. Today was the release of the final part. If you want to see more like this in the future, be sure to let Blizzard know you enjoyed it!
