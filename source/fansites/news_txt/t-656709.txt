I don't think there is any word to describe this video, but I guess that "clever use of game mechanics" works. Goon Squad on US-Mal'Ganis managed to capture Wintergrasp by using a lot of engineers and a lot of grenades.

From Premonition Premonition Website http://www.premoguild.com
This kill was a long time coming. We were working on it for weeks months? and theorycraft began ages ago. All of the silly forum threads and "math" that proved it impossible were quite obviously not even close to accurate.

The progression phases a raid goes through on this fight while learning are just amazing. From how to keep ahead in phase 2, maximizing stun times, getting all corruptors down, then dealing with mob handling in phase 3... with your tanks having extremely limited time, sanity, and tons of pressure to even figure out what they have to do to maximize efficiency, while your DPS is trying to not lose their own sanity while the boss is killed.

The strategies we went through and brainstormed were pretty damn bizarre at times rogues sprint kiting, priest fade kiting, warlock demonic teleport kiting, all seemed insane. We settled for a split strategy which required insane AOE dps to pull off successfully, and that's where the summertime + holidays showed up!

It was an absolute blast, Blizzard truly designed something marvelous here, and we were very excited to know it wasn't going to be nerfed after all reducing the number of beacons that go out would really ruin the complexity and ways to handle phase 3.

Great job by everyone in guild, and our members who couldn't be there, and especially our trials who stuck it out. Much respect to STARS and Paragon.

Video will be coming, frostmage/tank PoV.
