Mount Models
We can assume that they are the models of the mounts introduced with this build ... 

Invincible http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/72286/ - Summons and dismisses the flying undead horse Invincible. This mount changes depending on your Riding skill and location. 
Big Love Rocket http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/71342/ - Summons and dismisses a rideable Big Love Rocket. This mount changes depending on your Riding skill and location.

The Love Rocket will most likely be a rare drop from the Valentine's Day event and Invincible was Arthas' Mount before and after he became a Death Knight. The grave of his horse was in Balnir Farmstead in Tirisfal Glades. Last year during the Zombie Invasion world event, the grave was dug up randomly. Thanks to War from Haomarush-US for the tip, you can also check the article on WoWWiki http://www.wowwiki.com/Invincible
