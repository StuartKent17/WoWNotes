Head Enchants Removed<br>
Head enchants are gone. <br>
<br>
We decided that putting head enchants on the various faction vendors wasn&apos;t working well with our design intent for the factions. There is a lot of max-level quest content in MoP, much of it focused around the reputation with the new factions. I think it&apos;s really cool stuff -- worlds away from the old Argent Dawn scourge stone days.<br>
<br>
In previous expansions, the head enchants on the faction vendors served to force players into that content. You couldn&apos;t even choose which reputation to pursue -- you had to pursue the one with your specific head enchant. Our design intent for MoP is to give players options in how to play, and the head enchant design wasn&apos;t compatible with that. <br>
<br>
Once we decided to no longer offer new head enchants, we made the older ones non-functional or else players would feel like they had to go back to older content or be missing out on power. This way, helmets are just no longer enchantable and you&apos;ll have one less required step to get a piece of loot ready to wear.<br>
<br>
Shoulder enchants can now be provided by scribes, so those still exist, but they are also not part of the faction reputation system. <br>

Session Spoofing<br>
We&apos;ve investigated several reports of &quot;session spoofing,&quot; as reported both in these forums and elsewhere on the internet. We treat these kinds of reports very seriously; however, to date, we have yet to identify a single case of compromise which was the result of a player joining or participating in a public game. <br>
<br>
Additionally, we&apos;ve looked into the issue and found no evidence to indicate compromises are occurring in this fashion, and we&apos;ve determined the methods being suggested to do so are technically impossible. <br>
<br>
Even so, we&apos;re continuing to investigate related reports. If you have evidence which supports your claim that such reports are &quot;100% true,&quot; then please relay that information to our support representatives. If you&apos;re just spreading hearsay, however...well, that&apos;s just not cool. Spinning the rumor mill isn&apos;t helping the community, it&apos;s only making it dizzy.

Auction House Error 31073<br>
Players will sometimes receive &quot;Error 31073&quot; when attempting to create a new auction. This is an intentional measure to help improve auction house stability by throttling the number of auctions that can be created at any given time. To that end we plan on updating the messaging that accompanies this error in a future patch to better describe why players are receiving it. If you receive this error message when attempting to list an auction you should wait a few moments and try again. While we understand this is an inconvenience, our goal is to ensure a more stable auction house experience for everyone.
