Azerite Armor from Emissary Rewards Now Scale to 370<br>
Azerite Armor that is rewarded from emissaries can now scale up to item level 370 after today&apos;s maintenance. It seems like you have to have an item level of 370 for the rewards to scale to it, but that threshold hasn&apos;t been confirmed. <br>

Ranked PvP Item Levels<br>
There is one question that I have seen alot that has never been answered. We know the Weekle cache loot is based on the highest rating for the week, even if you fall below that rating you still get it. But what about the random end of match drops? For example: I currently have duelist rank (over 2100 rating), so therfore I get duelist loot (ilvl 370). But what if I drop down below duelist rank, to lets say 1900 rating, and then get a random end of match loot. Does this end of match loot drop duelist loot (370), or will it drop at the rating im currently at(365)?<br>
<br>
An answer on this would be much appreciated since I can&apos;t seem to find an answer anywhere, and getting an actual drop is also impossible. Anyone?<br>
Just received an answer back regarding this one.<br>
<br>
The item level of any gear received at the end of the match should scale based on the rating you had when the match began.<br>
<br>
So, for you example, if you entered a match with a duelist level rating, any gear you receive should be at least 370. But if you lose and drop out of the duelist range, any gear you receive at the end of subsequent matches will be of lower item level until you get back into the duelist range.
