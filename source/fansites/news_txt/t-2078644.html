Patch 7.0.3 Hotfixes - September 26<br>
Additional class tuning changes were added to the hotfix notes:<br>
Classes<br>
Developer&#x2019;s Notes: After carefully considering the constructive feedback we&#x2019;ve received over the weekend, we&#x2019;ve made some revisions to this week&#x2019;s tuning. The class changes listed in this hotfix update, as well as those from the previous update will be applied during weekly maintenance in each region. Note that several changes from the previous update have been altered or removed, which is indicated by a strikethrough in the notes below.<br>

<br>
Havoc<br>

Bloodlet (Talent) now deals 150% of initial Throw Glaive damage.<br>

<br>
Arcane<br>
<br>
Quickening (Talent)&#x2019;s maximum stacks are now 50, and it will not refresh its duration once at 50 stacks.<br>

<br>
Shadow<br>
<br>
Mind Sear damage increased by 80% and Insanity generation increased by 50%.<br>
Mind Flay damage increased by 20%.<br>
Mind Spike damage increased by 28%.<br>
Void Ray maximum stacks reduced to 4.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; Notes: Given the damage increase to Mind Sear, Mind Flay, and Mind Spike, this still results in an overall increase to the value of the talent.<br>
<br>
Voidform stacks no longer increase while Dispersion is active.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; Notes: We would prefer that Surrender to Madness not be as dominant as it is, and that it can&#x2019;t be extended for quite so long. However, addressing this further would require significant changes to the spec beyond what we want to do in a tuning pass at this time. We will look for an opportunity to take a more comprehensive look at this issue in a future patch.<br>

Patch 7.0.3 Hotfixes - September 23<br>
Several of the previously listed hotfixes were altered or removed. The rest of the original hotfixes still will be applied. <br>

<br>
Shadow<br>
<br>
Mind Sear damage and Insanity generation increased by 50%.<br>
Voidform stacks no longer increase while Dispersion and Void Torrent are active. <br>
<br>
Note: These abilities prevent Insanity drain from increasing while active, which effectively reduces the Insanity drain for the entire remainder the current Voidform. This was proving to be too powerful, so we&#x2019;re now making sure that the damage bonus and Insanity drain from Voidform remain in sync.<br>
<br>
The benefit of Mass Hysteria (Artifact Trait) is now capped at 100%. <br>
<br>
Note: We want it to be rewarding when you&#x2019;re able to maintain Surrender to Madness for an extremely long time, but the amount of damage this trait was contributing in those circumstances was excessive.<br>

Skinning and Mob Tapping<br>
We agree that the way this works at present isn&apos;t ideal and can be quite frustrating. It&apos;s something we want to fix, but it&apos;s quite a complicated issue to tackle so we don&apos;t have a good estimate on when any fix might happen. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/769968-let-us-skin-our-mob/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17613552300?page=2#31))<br>
<br>
Legion Reception<br>
I appreciate the post, but I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a point for this discussion to continue.<br>
<br>
If you pay attention to the majority of our community, on these forums, on social media, on our fansites, and in-game, reaction to Legion is overwhelmingly positive and a large majority of the player-base is having a pretty great time. In fact, I haven&apos;t seen so many people happy with such large aspects of the game since mid-Wrath.<br>
<br>
We appreciate people&apos;s feedback, but there&apos;s a point where we disagree - and this is it.<br>
<br>
Closing.<br>
<br>
Edit: I&apos;m the first to admit the our game isn&apos;t perfect, and that therein, Legion isn&apos;t either, but that does not herald the death of WoW/Legion, and talking in circles about that doesn&apos;t help the community.
