2.3.2 Patch
The next patch isn't "too far out" [color=white] Source 



General
Class balance is being watched VERY closely at the moment. Source 



Mages
Frostbite is currently bugged and won't proc from frostbolts. The bug has been identified and will be fixed in the next patch.



Wrath of the Lich King
The rested bonus will reset on all characters at the release of expansion to prevent people rushing through the content. Taking the rested bonus into account would just end up in tweaking to make the leveling longer in the first levels, making it too long for people without any rested bonus. Source 
There is no plan at all to add the Scourge as a 3rd faction Source

World of Warcraft commercials
Sorry, I had to post them. We can almost expect that World of Warcraft will be Chuck Norris approved soon.
