Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons: Lumber Mill
Today we are taking a look at the Lumber Mill  garrison building. 

The Lumber Mill  takes up a Medium plot which can also be used for a Barn , Gladiator's Sanctum , Trading Post  or Inn / Tavern  Once upgraded to Tier 3, your garrison will have two Medium plots available.

Abilities
This building is good for stockpiling garrison resources. 


Level 1 - Allows you to mark small trees in Draenor for harvest. Harvested Timber can be converted to work orders for Garrison supplies. 
Level 2 - Allows you to mark medium trees for additional Timber. 
Level 3 - Allows you to mark large trees for even more Timber. 


Work Orders
The Lumber Mill allows you to mark trees in Draenor for lumberjacks to cut down, which gives you Timber. You can then trade 50 Timber for ~100 Garrison Resources  and ~45 Apexis Crystal  Each small tree gives ~5 Timber and medium trees give ~10 Timber. 

Learning to mark small trees requires the completion of Easing into Lumberjacking , followed by Sharper Blades, Bigger Timber  for medium trees.

Blood Elf Models
Much like the Draenei, the Blood Elf models are already pretty good. We haven't begun working on the new Blood Elves yet, so I can't comment on the result, but personally I would expect it to be similar to the new Draenei. Of course they'll have higher quality textures and higher polygon counts, overall a big improvement, but not as drastic of an upgrade as the original eight races are seeing with their updates. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Garrison Plot Count
It is intentional that you'll be making some tough decisions on which buildings and their bonuses you want. Instead of having a lot of buildings with mediocre bonuses, we reduced the number of plots you have and redesigned the building bonuses to be quite impactful to your gameplay. Overall our design philosophy is that a few meaningful decisions is better than lots of inconsequential ones.

They're all cool in their own way and you'll probably want all of them to varying degrees. You're free to switch buildings if at some point you want to go with something else, but there is of course a cost and time investment to do so to build the new building. Swapping around a lot probably won't be the best way to operate your Garrison up to you, but the option is definitely there. We're of course keeping an eye on balance of the building bonuses, as well as how the feature could expand in the future, but it is very deliberate that you'll have to make some tough decisions on which buildings you want for the bonuses they provide.

in general, how happy are you with mechanica/rotations of tanks?They pretty much final? Or a possibility of last minute changes?
.Mechanically, mostly happy. However, tanks are still massively overperforming, and we're planning some significant nerfs. Celestalon 
Right now we're seeing tanks being alright in dungeons, where they're not chaining cooldowns and using AM well. ... Celestalon 
But in raids, where they are doing those things, they're nigh-unkillable. Need to bring that back down to sanity. Celestalon 
Not to mention in a lot of the mythic testing so far, tanks can't just survive forever alone like live, they can get trucked ...
Right. We're having to hit tanks extreeeeeemely hard in order to endanger them at all right now. Going to retune bosses as well. Celestalon 
Fun fact: Almost every mythic boss currently hits tanks harder than Lei Shen did proportional to the expansion. That's silly. Celestalon 

and whats with your obsession over auto attacks and passive damage playing the game for you? ele mastery and searing totem..
Definitely not. It's important that there's some of that, but not too much. Super passive damage in the ~20-40% range is good. Celestalon 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Now Blood DKs can only choose DeathPact in the Lv75 Tier since DeathSiphon doesnt apply Bloodshield and Conversion new 30RP cost
We chose that number because we think that will balance it, not kill it. We'll see how it turns out; sky-is-falling unhelpful. Celestalon 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
What were the reasons behind removing frostbolt's ability to heal the water elemental?
It was extremely rarely used, and caused a lot of bugs. Very rare that we change something due to bugginess, but happens sometimes Celestalon 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
sooooo ww monks can't use touch of death on players? Intended? I hope not
It will be usable on players below 10%. Not sure if its in this build or the next one. holinka 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
is shadow word pain spam in WoD intended or not?
Definitely not. Celestalon 
I hope the solution is fixing Mind Flay's damage, instead of just eliminating SW:P's damage on application.
The solution is a mix. MFlay's damage is being tweaked, and SW:P's direct damage will no longer proc SApps/SInsight. Celestalon 
But now sw: p on the move will be really really bad if you have Auspicious Spirit.
No, it just won't be any better than normal with Auspicious Spirit. Celestalon 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Will Reincarnation be my only threat-dump as elemental in Warlords? Why remove the little threat-dump we had from Wind Shear?
Because it muddles the purpose of the ability and was completely pointless. Celestalon 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
"Safeguard no longer removes movement-impairing effects." Does it include roots? If so, good change.
It does. holinka 

Honest question, did you feel it was overpowered to be able to get out of roots once/30 sec through a talent? safeguard
Yes, we felt it gave them a counter they didn't need. Charge and Heroic Leap give them the ability to get on target quickly. holinka 

Character / Items
>transformation items. 20 sec duration for like 10-30 min CD? Not worth it at all. : |
Lately we're doing 1 hour/10 min and that feels ok to me, might check out some older ones and bump them Muffinus 
is this your philosophy on all "toys?" If so, just stop wasting your time making them. Long CDs already diminish their fun.
You'd rather have no toys at all, than not be able to look like Mr. Smite all the time? Not sure many would agree with you. Muffinus 

So what about stuff like Savory Deviate Delight? Sure, consumed and has to be "farmed", but laughable effort, considering AH.
Lots of variables here, sellable and consumable, so affected by gold inflation, takes up bag space, and thus limited Muffinus 

They won't be usable when we enter raids for the first time in WoD, DM Faire isn't until 7 dec
Well, yes. And that affects everyone equally - you'll be able to make one soon after. WatcherDev 

PvE
Try to remember this, a good mechanic is hard and can be explained within 4 Minutes to everyone.This will be fun!
Writing the Dungeon Journal Overviews has been a good exercise in whether mechanics can be distilled down to a few words. WatcherDev 

PvP
random ashran thought. Maybe a small tutorial window pop up explaining the features of ashran. Mage tower,mid lane, side objectives
We use our quest system for this type of thing. Definitely open to how current intro quests fall short. holinka 
effective than quests. Many pvpers rush threw quests to get to pvp and this will just add more quests to that process IMO
Well, those same people will probably ignore a tutorial. Quests give rewards which provide motivation to complete them. holinka 

Are you bringing back the Arena Pass? Just curious 
We are not. holinka 
Arena Team Names?
Nothing planned for arena names. holinka 

Hmm just saw call to arms gone for WoD WIll exp be buffed for leveling on randoms? For example AV IoC BfG exp > rest of bgs
Interesting. We'll take a look at the honor earn rates. We buffed the ones with low earn rate recently. holinka 

UI / Addons
Will combo point UI ever getting an update for the change? P.S. Cloak and Dagger should switch places with and slow your target.
It's something we're considering for the future. Celestalon 

Garrisons
If you collect these followers with the inn but get rid of it, do you keep them?
Yep! Muffinus 
Any chance you could have them not as a permanent loss if dismissed, but a chance to get from the Inn again?
If you dismiss them, there's always the chance they'll show up again at your inn Muffinus 

Thanks! Do you have the plan to increase the followers cap? 20 and 25 seems not enough.
Closely monitoring feedback on this Muffinus
