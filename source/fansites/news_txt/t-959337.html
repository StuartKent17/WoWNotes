Classes<br>

Threat<br>

Threat generation for all tanks has been increased to 500%, up from 300%. This applies to warriors in Defensive Stance, death knights in Blood Presence, druids in Bear Form, and paladins with Righteous Fury.<br>
Vengeance should no longer be generated when damage is fully absorbed by damage shields. When the shield breaks from damage or damage is partially absorbed, the amount of Vengeance generated is equal to the full amount of damage taken (including the damage absorbed.)<br>

GC&apos;s latest blog: Active Mitigation Playstyle<br>
Right now it&apos;s tough for DK tanks because they&apos;re the only ones on anything resembling an active mitigation model. The one active mitigation guy is going to look like he&apos;s working harder than the passive mitigation guys because, in a lot of ways, he is. If all tanks had worked this way from the start, it would be the norm, and nobody would be worried about jumping onto that model.<br>
<br>
We&apos;ve already established that threat isn&apos;t making for very compelling encounter design, and removing it offers us the ability to get creative with some of the mechanics that we&apos;re using; both in encounter and class design. In a world with no threat management, and no active mitigation, that doesn&apos;t leave a lot for tanks to do though. We think that making tanking more active, and focusing that activity around mitigation (which feels immediately useful) will generate some very rewarding gameplay. We want the act of tanking to be engaging, interesting and fun. We think the path forward will offer more of that for all the tanking classes.<br>
<br>
Also, I&apos;ve seen a number of references to making tanking easier in this thread and elsewhere. &quot;Easier&quot; isn&apos;t really the goal. The goal is to discard a mechanic which we don&apos;t think is working particularly well anymore, and replace it with something more focused and interesting. Doing so should also have the effect of allowing tanks who aren&apos;t as geared still do their job when grouped with players who outgear (or even outlevel them a bit). They&apos;ll still be responsible for doing a good job, but their absolute ability to hold the attention of the boss won&apos;t be a factor; their ability to play well and mitigate damage will be.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re aware of player concerns about Blood tanking, and we&apos;ll work to ensure that Blood tanking will continue to be viable and effective into the future. On that note, we&apos;re interested in addressing some of the concerns that have been expressed about the spec (potentially as soon as the next major patch), though we want to accomplish that goal without sacrificing what sets the spec apart and makes it interesting.
