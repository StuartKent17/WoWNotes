Reposting it mostly because I can&apos;t post anything today that will survive the announcement of the new Blizzard game in a few hours. (It&apos;s not WoW related, but hey, we love Blizzard don&apos;t we ?)<br>
<br>
The latest updates are the Scepter of Purification and the Midnight Chestguard (this one was dropped yesterday by Forte (http://www.clan-forte.com))<br>

It&apos;s &quot;old&quot; news, but it may &quot;interest&quot; some people. I personally wish a lot of fun to the one who will take his place, I&apos;ll skip my turn. <br>
Tseric is now pursuing other opportunities and we wish him the best in his future endeavors.</div></div>
