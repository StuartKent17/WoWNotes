<br>
The Alterac Brew Pup (https://us.battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-pet-alterac-brew-pup) is a hardy friend who&#x2019;s always ready to lend a paw or revitalizing swig of &#x201C;good cheer&#x201D; to anyone in need. Bred for rescue duty, the Alterac brewhound&apos;s bloodline is famous for having found and resuscitated many mountain travelers trapped beneath the snow . . . and then slobbering all over them. The most famous brewhound of all is Bernard, credited with saving upwards of 50 lives&#x2014;many of them dwarf and orc soldiers dragged out of the snow beneath the treacherous bridges of Alterac Valley. <br>
