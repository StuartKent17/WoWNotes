World first level 80 character is French !
French people just run faster it seems ... Nymh - Drek'thar [FR] http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek%27thar&n=Nymh was the first character to reach level 80 in the new expansion - Wrath of the Lich King ! Congratulations to him and his guild, Genesis http://www.guilde-genesis.org !

In case you're wondering, there isn't too much fancy powerleveling behind that, just a healer out of group.
