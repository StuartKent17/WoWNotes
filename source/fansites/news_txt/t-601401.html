Important : If you&apos;re getting virus alerts from the patch (from the Blizzard downloader or from here, it doesn&apos;t matter), please read this post (https://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=110636194&amp;sid=1) on the official forums.<br>
We&apos;ve been in the process of investigating this issue and we have been able to confirm that this is indeed a false-positive detection by a few anti-viruses in regards to the Blizzard Downloader. The Blizzard Downloader, which is used to download patches, does not contain a trojan, virus, or other malicious code.<br>
<br>
We have been working directly with many anti-virus companies to resolve this, some of which have already deployed updated virus definitions that resolve this error. We recommend updating your definitions if you&apos;ve received this false positive related to the Blizzard Downloader, and that you continue to check for updates as a resolution should be available soon if it is not already.<br>

<br>
Don&apos;t forget that even if this warning is false, it doesn&apos;t mean that all of them are. Don&apos;t go retarded with your antivirus thinking that you&apos;re safe. You&apos;re never safe on the interweb, the bad guys, they&apos;re watching us, everywhere.</div></div>
