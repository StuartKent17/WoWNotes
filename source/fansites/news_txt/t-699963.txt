Boubouille2010-03-06, 07:14 AMRuby Sanctum - Info Compilation / Preview [Spoiler]
Most of the Ruby Sanctum have been pushed in this patch and it looks like I have enough data in my hands for a small preview. As usual keep in mind that:
This is only a preview based on game files, I could be wrong on a few things.
Ruby Sanctum isn't even scheduled for release for Patch 3.3.3, it will be added with Patch 3.3.5 and a LOT of things can change in so much time.


Official Description
As we prepare for the public testing phase of minor content patch 3.3.3, some players might come across information regarding upcoming content that isn't yet available. To avoid any confusion, we'd like to tell you about an exciting new raid dungeon we are working on for content patch 3.3.5.

The Ruby Sanctum

A powerful war party of the Black Dragonflight, led by the fearsome Twilight dragon, Halion, have launched an assault upon the Ruby Sanctum beneath Wyrmrest Temple. By destroying the sanctum, the Black Dragonflight look to crush those that would stand in the way of their master’s reemergence into Azeroth and to ultimately shatter the Wyrmrest Accord – the sacred bond that unites the dragonflights.

The battle that is to come will surely deal a crippling blow to the Red Dragonflight, however, it is up to you to stop this unprecedented offensive and defend the Ruby Sanctum. First you must face the assault of Halion's servants, Saviana Ragefire, Baltharus the Warborn, and General Zarithrian, before squaring off against Halion the Twilight Destroyer, a new and deadly force in this realm.

The Ruby Sanctum will feature 10- and 25-player content, Heroic difficulties and all-new rewards! Stay tuned for more information as we get closer to its release. 


More Details on the instance / Loot Table by Zarhym

Number 2. The lieutenants are sub-bosses which will each drop an Emblem of Frost  Halion is the main boss. While the activation of Heroic difficulty is different from the Obsidian Sanctum, the overall raid format for the Ruby Sanctum is very comparable. 
You're likely to find some random pieces of armor on par with Lich King loot, similar to the items Onyxia dropped while Trial of the Crusader was the top-tier raid. You can also expect to see some more trinkets and things of that nature. 
This raid will not only provide a bit of additional content to pair with the current content of patch 3.3, it will be the beginning of an advancement in the storyline for Cataclysm. 
The plan is to have a normal mode and a heroic mode just like Icecrown Citadel, so far there is no plan for a Sartharion +1/+2/+3-like encounter.

Eyes of Twilight  - Each time your direct healing spells heal a target you cause the target of your heal to heal themselves and friends within 10 yards for 402 each sec for 6 sec. Twilight Renewal 


Halion Supposed Skills
These abilities are probably used by Halion. There isn't any way to confirm that before Patch 3.3.5 is deployed on live or PTR servers but they seem to be the only skills with hard mode versions. Assuming that you won't be able to activate the heroic mode on the mini-bosses, these skills are most likely used by Halion. 

Keep in mind that this is only a theory based on the game files.

<td style="font-weight: bold;"> I do not have a lot of details on Corporeality for the moment, but it looks like the % of Corporeality of Halion will vary during the fight. Corporeality increases damage dealt and damage taken apparently, ranging from 20~30% to 200% depending on the version of the buff. I guess it could be used by players as well, especially if Dusk Shroud  is running throughout the fight.</td>

Mini-Boss Supposed Skills
The remaining skills only come in two versions most of the time, it means no hard modes and they are most likely the skills used during the fight against the 3 mini bosses. There is no way to link skills to a specific mini-boss and I will just keep them together.

Transcripts
Last but not least, here is a transcript of the dialogue with Xerestrasza of the Red Dragonflight.

RS_Xerestrasza_Yell01.wav - Help! I am trapped within this tree! I require aid!
RS_Xerestrasza_Yell02.wav - Thank you! I could have not held out for much longer. A terrible thing has happened here.
RS_Xerestrasza_Say01.wav - We believed that the Sanctum was well fortified, but we were not prepareted for the nature of this assault. 
RS_Xerestrasza_Say02.wav - The Black Dragonkin materialized from thin air, and set upon us before we could react. 
RS_Xerestrasza_Say03.wav - We did not stand a chance. As my brethren perished around me, I managed to retreat hear and bar the entrance. 
RS_Xerestrasza_Say04.wav - They slaughtered us with cold efficiency, but the true focus of their interest seemed to be the eggs kept here in the sanctum. 
RS_Xerestrasza_Say05.wav - The commander of the forces on the ground here is a cruel brute named Zarithrian. But I fear there are greater powers at work. 
RS_Xerestrasza_Say06.wav - In their initial assault I caught a glimpse of their true leader, a fearsome full-grown Twilight Dragon.
RS_Xerestrasza_Say07.wav - I know not the extent of their plans heroes, but I know this: they cannot be allowed to succeed!

Halion also has a couple of interesting lines. 

RS_Halion_Aggro01.wav - Your world teeters on the brink of annihilation. You will all bear witness to the coming of a new age of destruction!
RS_Halion_Beserk01.wav - Not good enough!
RS_Halion_Death01.wav - Relish this victory mortals, for it will be your last. This world will burn with the Master's return!
RS_Halion_Phase2.wav - You will find only suffering within the realm of Twilight. Enter if you dare. 
RS_Halion_Phase3.wav - I am the light AND the darkness! Cower mortals before the Herald of Deathwing!
RS_Halion_Slay01.wav - Another hero falls.
RS_Halion_Slay02.wav - Ha Ha Ha!
RS_Halion_Spawn01.wav - Meddlesome insects, you're too late! The Ruby Sanctum is lost.
RS_Halion_Special01.wav - The heavens burn!
RS_Halion_Special02.wav - Beware the shadow!

Ruby Sanctum Questline
A couple of quests will be added to the game to introduce the Ruby Sanctum. If you do not know who are the dragons mentioned in the quest descriptions, you might want to check the Dargonax  / Sinestra  articles on WoWWiki.

Quest - Trouble at Wyrmrest 
Objective - Speak with Krasus at Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight.
Description
My old friend Krasus sends word of dire happenings at Wyrmrest, in Dragonblight. His missive was brief, but it seems that there has been some sort of attack on the Ruby Sanctum beneath the Temple.

Pressing business here in Dalaran keeps me from attending to the matter personally, but I have heard word of your exploits in the Lich King's Citadel and you are doubtless up to the task -- perhaps you could assist Krasus in my stead? 

Quest - Assault on the Sanctum 
Objective - Investigate the Ruby Sanctum beneath Wyrmrest Temple.
Description
<race>, something terrible has transpired within the Ruby Sanctum beneath the Temple. The entry to the Sanctum is in ruins, and its guardians violently slain. We sent scouts to investigate, but they have not returned. I cannot help but fear the worst.

Enter the Ruby Sanctum and discover what has befallen the home of my flight. Once we have more information, we can plan our next steps accordingly. 

Quest - The Twilight Destroyer 
Objective - Defeat Halion and repel the invasion of the Ruby Sanctum.
Rewards - Emblem of Frost  x 5
Description
This was no reckless attack, but rather a carefully orchestrated strike against the heart of the Red Dragonflight. Zarithrian, on the bluff over there, is overseeing the assault, but the true leader of this force is a brash and powerful Twilight dragon named Halion. Not since Dargonax has a full-grown spawn of Sinestra's twisted experiments been seen.

Slay him, <name>, and then when the invasion has been fully repelled, report to Krasus regarding all you have seen here.
