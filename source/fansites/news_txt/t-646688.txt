Keep in mind that some of these changes my require the realm to be restarted to take effect. 

Argent Tournament
Players who are Champions of Exodar should now display the appropriate Exodar banner.

Children's Week
If a player loses their Orphan Whistle at any time during the in-game Children's Week event they can speak to a Matron in cities to receive a replacement.

Ulduar
Mimiron should no longer continue to cast Heat Wave after phase 2 is completed.
The Pollinate spell cast by the Forest Swarmer inside of the Conservatory of Life in Ulduar should no longer be spell stealable.
The NPCs in the Hodir encounter will now cast Storm Power and Toasty Fire more quickly after being freed from Flash Freeze at the start of the encounter. Toasty Fire will also be cast more consistently throughout the fight.

Mana Burn has been reduced to 10% mana burned up to a maximum of 20% of the Priests mana, down from 13% max 26%.
Mana Burn now causes Fear, Hex and Psychic Scream to break early when used.
