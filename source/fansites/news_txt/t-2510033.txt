There is a new event, the Brewfest Chowdown, which is an eating contest. 

The event begins once 4 people click the stand.
You have 3 buttons - one to eat, one to drink, and one to call for more food.

Eating fills your bar
Drinking reduces the bar.
You have to call for more food after eating 3x.

The goal is to be the first to finish 10 plates while trying not to let the bar get to 100 as it makes you choke for a few seconds

A variety of events other than a Dark Iron attack can happen such as alementals running rampant or Hozen attacks.
Down With The Dark Iron https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/1186-down-with-the-dark-iron has been removed from the Brewmaster https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/1683-brewmaster achievement.
The loot from Coren Direbrew https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/23872-coren-direbrew is item level 395 for max level characters.
