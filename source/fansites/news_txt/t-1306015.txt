Battle.net Desktop Client
The new Battle.net desktop client has been tested internally for some time now. It appears that testing is nearly here, as the Battle.net support site has been updated with related help articles https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/uninstalling-battlenet-desktop-app.

Currently only a Windows version has appeared for testing, but by the looks of the jobs page http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/posting.html?id=130003H, a OS X version is in development as well. Unfortunately we are only able to see the offline mode for now, but there are a lot of features in the mockups.

Keep in mind this is not an official preview, and many, many, many things will change before release.


This replaces the launcher for all Blizzard games, and works similar to the current launchers, with background updates, repair tool, and more.
Chat with Battle.net friends across every Battle.net enabled game.
News - You can see all of the news from the various Battle.net game sites in the client.

These do not represent the final client at all, just a snapshot of development plans in the past. The final client will not look like this.
