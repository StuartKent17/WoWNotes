Kul Tiras  was founded 3,000 years ago when a group of Gilneans  left the empire to explore the Great Sea  They came upon a mountainous region rich in resources and decided to settle in. Over the course of the next 2,500 years they built one of the most powerful navies on Azeroth. These humans are much more burly than the mainlanders because of their time spent on the sea hunting monsters. The Alliance will be bringing them into their ranks as an Allied Race.
