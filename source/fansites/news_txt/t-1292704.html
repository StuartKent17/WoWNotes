Patch 5.3 on the Background Downloader<br>
Late this week the launcher started to download ~270 MB of assets for Patch 5.3. It is likely that the patch will be here in a few weeks, but no Release Candidate build yet!<br>

Patch 5.3 PTR - Build 16896<br>
There was a very minor PTR patch this afternoon, it only had two significant changes, one of them being the addition of the Block Chat Channel Invites option. <br>
<br>
The other change was an increase in the amount of PvP Power Rating needed to get 1% PvP Power from 265 to 400.<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
Misc<br>
There are no easy fixes to low pop relams. We are working on some fixes, but too early to talk about them yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325327940743221248))<br>
<br>
So what you&apos;re saying is that it&apos;s bad to bench people because you want to stack a class but fine when you want diversity?<br>
We don&apos;t want e.g. warlocks to never get brought to a raid. If you are encouraged to bring a mage b/c you have 3 locks, that&apos;s fine. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324580994361479168))<br>
And in most cases, you could bring 6 locks and still progress. You&apos;re less efficient, but not dramatically so. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324581193343434752))<br>
My overall advice to most players is to pay more attention to fun and less to efficiency. I predict you will enjoy the game more. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324581341561769984))<br>
<br>
A lot of people still don&apos;t know about changes you guys make, any plans on in-game patch notes?<br>
If they don&apos;t read our website why would they read them in game? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322389462250291200))<br>
<br>
Do you guys have interns programming your tooltips or something? Seems that there are always a TON of &quot;tooltip bugs&quot;.<br>
There are just a lot of things that can change a spell&apos;s points and the game doesn&apos;t know them all innately. We have to fix &apos;em up. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321770790271987712))<br>
We&apos;ve gotten spell tooltips much more accurate to the point where the inaccuracies jump out now. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321770637335089152))<br>
If you look back over the history of WoW, the tooltips were stupidly inaccurate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321770496876232704))<br>
<br>
As an artist I can tell 100% that there are more than enough skilled artists with superior quality compared to something<br>
We would love to get more of their resumes. Many artists these days study photo manipulation, but can&apos;t always make a good sword. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321319667757101057))<br>
<br>
You can`t seriously be saying making more content is a problem of there not being enough skilled people in the WORLD to hire?<br>
We haven&apos;t interviewed everyone in the world yet. Hiring is a slow process and we are quite picky. We don&apos;t hire to fill a quota. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321319277946892288))<br>
<br>
(Curiosity): does Blizzard have a working definition of &#x201C;casual&#x201D;? If so, is it more about what you do, or how much you play?<br>
We don&apos;t really. Casual is too broad a word. We try to have content aimed at a wide variety of players. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/320299860928651264))<br>
I just see a casual gamer as someone who is playing &quot;casually&quot;, means on occassion.<br>
There are also very experienced and skilled players who play only rarely. &quot;Casual&quot; doesn&apos;t really describe them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/320343094555967489))<br>
Likewise, we have players who play nearly every night, but only to RP and avoid raids or BGs. Not sure they are &quot;casual.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/320343241096581121))<br>
It&apos;s just one of those words that isn&apos;t precise enough to do the job. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/320343310159970307))<br>
<br>
Questions about data mined patch notes make you crazy. Confirm or deny ?<br>
Confirm, especially repeated questions that I already addressed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323149274613436417))<br>

Hearthstone Gameplay - Paladin vs Warrior<br>
