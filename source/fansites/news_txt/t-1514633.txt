Connected Realms Update 5/08
Both US and EU realm connections  appear to be officially on hold now. 
*Please note that further realm connections are on hold pending further back end work. We don't have an ETA on when these will resume, but we'll update this thread and the blog post once connections resume.

IMO only cast times and nearly nothing else is just as bad as spam-instants. Neither make interesting situations.
Well, philospohically, all-cast-times would be better than all-instants. However, we're at neither of those extremes. Celestalon 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Any changes to death knight presences? They are pretty much just passive aura buttons and do nothing to gameplay.
They're exclusive passive bonuses. Some gameplay, though not a lot. But doesn't need to be a lot. Celestalon 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Why was tranq made resto only? Some of my favorite moments through the years were clutch tranq saves as a feral
Because we're reducing stackable raid utility like that. Want to return raid survival to being the healers' job. Celestalon 
But yet Mage raid CD is stackable with any throughput healer CD, how do you not see that as a potential issue?
Errr... That's the point? Perhaps a misunderstanding of the goal? Celestalon 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
 This thread basically sums up most thoughts on KS. The second charge is terrible and unreliable.
Kill Shot will take less than 1/3 as long, including latency, to reset, in Warlords. We expect that will solve it. Celestalon 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
how is the pandemic effect on dots going to effect Living Bomb explosion?
Just like it works today, except with a 3.6sec overlap time, instead of [3/Haste] sec. Celestalon 
Would this lead to situation where you always want to refresh LB at that point throughout a fight to get more explosions?
No... That's the point. Celestalon 

You said there are too many raid cooldowns and now you make a new one for mages. Why?
Because we want to reduce them overall, but also balance them better. That means giving a small one to specs that have none. Celestalon 
6 raid cds at 100% effectiveness vs. 12 raid cds at 50% seems like no change besides more logistical headaches.
Yes, but how about against 8 raid CDs at 50%? That's more accurately comparable to what we're doing. Celestalon 
Why not just give them to healers/tanks? That way nobody stacks certain DPSers due to raid CDs?
A fair question. The answer is that we don't feel it's reasonable to completely remove them all. Celestalon 
Do we cut Safeguard? Stampeding Roar? Demonic Portal? Sacred Shield? How many new talents would we have to create to fill holes? Celestalon 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Are you taking away the snare from Fists of Fury for Windwalkers?
You mean the stun? Nope. You can glyph it to trade the stun for the ability to move during it. Celestalon 

Can all eminence healing be tied to statue?
No, you don't want that. Celestalon 
Also, can the cd be removed from statue? Is there any -real- reason it has a cd to begin with?
Well, it's so that you care about the position you choose, and don't feel like you're expected to constantly move it. Celestalon 
However, a decent argument could be made that 30sec is more restrictive than is needed for that purpose. We'll discuss it. Celestalon 
Removing the global would be a step, 30 seconds would be fine if it didn't cost a global.
No, that'd be terrible. Not being on the global would imply that you are absolutely supposed to min/max its placement on every CD. Celestalon 

Or just like... make the statue do something else. It's pretty boring.
Soothing Mist and Eminence; one thing per stance. Celestalon 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
seems we could ignore the current twisting talent as prot will only have two seals.
Prot will indeed likely not use Seal of Insight much, without Empowered Seals. Celestalon 
confused; if insight doesn't give prot haste or heal procs what would it do?
Increased healing done. Celestalon 

Warriors getting defensive benefits from crit; Paladins nothing? Insight loosing 10% haste, Righteous still to little dmg to use
Yeah, this is all confusion. A There's no more spell haste, just full haste. B Holy Shield is likely undertuned; haven't tuned... Celestalon 
...yet. C Paladins get the exact same defensive benefit from Crit that Warriors do. D Spell Haste from Insight didn't benefit... Celestalon 
...you as Prot anyway. E Righteousness will be worth using in the next build. Celestalon 
thank you for responses. How did insight haste not help EF ticks? Seems like we have no good tanking seal now?
We're moving the heal-on-hit proc from Seal of Insight to a Prot passive. We'll expect Prot and Ret to use Truth and Rightousness. Celestalon 
On that topic, what sort of gameplay can we expect from Paladin seals in general? for all specs
Ret/Prot will swap Seals more than Holy will. Seal of Righteousness will convert Crusader Strike into Hammer of the Righteousness Celestalon 
Curious. Wonder if Righteous will apply the Truth DoT now? That would be a welcome addition!
No, it won't. Celestalon 

concerning emp seals, any chance you guys are taking seals off of gcd and they share their own? Would feel clunky otherwise
While it's an option, continue down that line of thinking. Where does it lead? What happens to your rotation? What buttons are used? Celestalon 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
.I assume a POM from the SAME priest will overwrite, and POM has 'weird' bouncing rules... some protection might be warranted
I don't believe there's anything to protect it from bouncing to a target that already has your PoM overwriting, but it goes to... Celestalon 
...a random injured target now, not the most injured, so that will be unlikely. Celestalon 
well there wouldn't be anything now, you can't have more than 1 out. I would assume you could have more than 1 out with WOMPOM
We're actually trying letting you have more than one out, anyway. Celestalon 

Since casting POM on a DI proc, could both be your final WOMPOM stack.... and both overwrite/cancel at the same time. No?
OK, we're going to try making it not bounce to targets you already have a PoM on. Celestalon 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
with the new echo of the elements talent with resto shaman is it possible to have two healing rains down at one time?
Yes. Celestalon 

any hope that earthquake could be shorter cast time or instant? Very frustrating to use no matter how much damage it does vs CL
No; cast time spells are good for gameplay. Celestalon 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
I was wondering if SB: Haunt would consume 2 soulshards to use. That's what started this Twitter bomb.
Yes. Soulburn costs a shard, then Haunt costs a shard. You get the Buff and the DD/Debuff. Celestalon 

Art
So how about hiding shoulders, then? Diff topic!
No current plans, but I can definitely see the appeal, especially for various cloth transmog looks. WatcherDev 

Can we have new spell visual for melee Rogue/War that are concerned? SS/Ambush/RvS have the same visual to not mention others.
Yeah, melee abilities tend to rely on animation more than visual effects, but we can definitely do more to make them feel epic. WatcherDev 

Character / Items
have you guys thought about set bonuses for making gear be best for PVE or PVP?
Past set bonuses made an effort to do that. It was never enough. holinka 

Warlords of Draenor Stats
Yea, it's a bit odd for tanks too. Stack Readiness to get another shield wall for a boss special or why get any?
Luckily, it affects more than just 3min cooldowns. Celestalon 

Gladstance going to disable Bonus Armor on gear? also does the armor factor into ilvl? I.E. Armor item on fury = less crit stat?
Bonus Armor will actually provide DPS value for tanks. Yes, it's part of the item's budget. Celestalon 
any tidbits about how? Thorns? Armored to the teeth? some new fangled quirky thing?
A passive, Bladed Armor. Increases Attack Power by 100% of your Bonus Armor. NOTE: Just *Bonus* Armor, not ALL Armor Celestalon 

PvE
Will reincarnation consume a combat ress charge?
No, just like with today's system, Reincarnation is a personal benefit that is outside the raid-level rules. WatcherDev 

PvP
what is your opinion on the reflect meta-gem that is picked by almost 80% of all healer & even some dps classes in arena
It's a bit curious as the chance is small. What are your thoughts about it? holinka 

if someone is pvp tagged in wod, and i heal them, will my ilevel increase too?
yes holinka 

Regarding gear having 2 ilvls... If an Ally raid is fighting a World Boss and 1 Horde AoEs them, the raid gets their ilvls buffed?
Yes, people could get into PvP to buff their DPS against world boss. It's a downside we can live with due to the upsides. holinka 
I'm just afraid it will be abused by people going for world 1st leveling, since they usually take a friend from another faction...
I really don't think we should not do the right thing for PvP because of a concern about world first leveling. holinka 

Don't you fear that some might exploit the ilvl activation on PvP in PvE e.g. world bosses for dps boost to the boss?
It might happen but we're not concerned about it. holinka 

did you say solo queue skirmishes?
I did holinka 

will there be hidden MMR in WoD skirmishes? please say yes 
Yes..but the matchmaking will be more focused on speed i.e. we'll expand the search faster than say Rated Arenas holinka 

can't wait to try out wod! Pvp is looking solid. Only concern is will pve gear still scale down in pvp instance?
only mythic holinka 
my fear would mainly be legendaries, that would not be mythic. Would legendaries scale down in pvp instances too?
The ilevel ceiling will work similar to now. PvP gear will ignore it but Mythic gear & Legendaries if it applies will be reduced. holinka 

I am curious about this as well, how can we see/compare the PVP stats when not in PVP?
Hm, I see, so you're saying the ability to see what the stats will be when PvP, not just the ilevel. holinka 
We haven't developed final solution for tooltip, but added this to video to illustrate the intent. holinka 
Certainly good to get feedback on initial reaction. holinka 

If my HP is 80k/100k; Horde hits me and max HP becomes 120k, does my HP stay at 80k or go to 96k 80%?
It stays relative so 96k. holinka 

Why does PvE and PvP gear have to be different? Why can't they be the same item just obtained from different means?
Conquest gear needs to at least match the best available raid gear for PvP, but is much more accessible by design. WatcherDev 

we want this a lot but our UI time is heavily constrained so we can't promise it. Russ Petersen 
Yes, unfortunately a "PvP mode" on the character pane is a big technical challenge. holinka 
[i] Also: you'll always be in "PvP mode" on Ashran, where gear vendors are.
And there will be a PvP dummy to put yourself in combat. holinka 
But still, gear tooltips can be improved. holinka 

How about everyone can join the PvP Beta realm for better PvP testing? Other content is deactivated so no spoilers.. consider it!
That will be the case. Anyone will be able to join the PvP Beta realm and all non-PvP content will be inaccessible. holinka 
Just to clarify, that's anyone in beta. holinka 

Professions
quick question, with glyphs been gained as one levels, is it a waste to have inscription now compared to other professions?
Not at all; it's just a handful of level-up glyphs to ease new players into the system. Most glyphs still come from scribes. WatcherDev 

Lore
You do realize that timetravel to the past is impossible because of closedform timecurves?Hawking &Carroll are isomorphic on this
yeah I don't get worked up about stuff like that. I'm more about the fiction than the science. But can understand why some ppl do holinka
