New cooking recipes in 2.4
New cooking recipes will be introduced in 2.4 to remove all the "gaps" in cooking leveling requiring you to level your fishing as well if you want to reach 300 cooking skill. 

Good Bye Salthem !
Salthem is going on to other duties in Blizzard and won't be posting on official forums anymore. Source http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=1906130993&postId=19053096142&sid=1#0

Free character transfer eligibility
"The realms chosen consist of source realms with the highest sustained queues, and destination realms with the lowest population. The numbers gathered are directly from our data, and depict the realms in most need of these transfers. We will be continuing to monitor all realms and open additional free transfers in the future where necessary."

Wrath of the Lich King
Don't expect WotLK too soon. Even if Blizzard would like to release an expansion a year they don't plan to rush anything for the sake of releasing one a year. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3269180613&postId=32336899996&sid=1#117

Night Elf Mohawk !
The Mohawk in the Mr. T advertising was a custom model made specifically for the commercial, there is no guarantee that it will be a new hair style in Wrath of the Lich King. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3270770857&postId=32336900708&sid=1#33

World Events
World Events can be a double edged sword, they're a very enjoyable experience for players but they take a lot of development for something only usable once most of the time. there is also the problem of forcing an entire server into a one location and all the performance issues it causes. They aren't ruled out, they just have to be planned very carefully. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3268470999&postId=32333506026&sid=1#14

SK Adds U.S. WoW Squad
SK Gaming are proud to announce the addition of an American World of Warcraft 3vs3 team. The players are well known from the notorious battlegroup 9 - Neilyo, Gumbot, Pronne, Mattyo and Mykke.

The World of Warcraft is increasing rapidly and the American PvP scene is very competitive, especially because of the bloodlust battlegroup bg9. This addition means that SK Gaming will have a top team from the most competative ladder in the world to represent them in future tournaments. The team will be focusing mainly on 3vs3, and by having five players the team will be able to switch to whatever fits the current patch and team best.

For those of you who doesn't know, or maybe just wants to know more about the players, a brief introduction of them all can be found on SK-Gaming http://www.sk-gaming.com/content/15270-SK_Adds_US_WoW_Squad.
