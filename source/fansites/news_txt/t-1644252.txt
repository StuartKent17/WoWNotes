Warcraft Movie Trailer Fan Art
The Warcraft movie shown at Blizzcon never made its way to the internet, but Yanmo Zhang watched it multiple times and sketched out the scenes that were shown. You can find Yanmo Zhang's art on his website  or DeviantArt 

There is some additional context for each image on the DeviantArt page

I'm confused by some of the trinkets nerfs and I'm not talking about epic BoE trinkets. Why nerf regular heroic trinkets that hard?
We're planning on making more trinket changes, but I don't have details beyond that yet CM_Lore 

Garrisons
Is mining ever going to be worth anything this xpac.
The Garrison was giving too much ore. That was hotfixed yesterday. Will take some time to see the effects. CM_Lore 

PvP
Why did you remove the exp bonus for completing a BG?! I thought you wanted to make leveling through PvP/BGs more rewarding in WoD?
it's a bug on our radar to fix holinka 

Ashran is really quite a disappointment, everyone on my server says the same. You never fixed faction imbalance at all...
We're still working on it. holinka 


Gorgrond to Timeless Isle Teleport
Several users have mentioned this now, so we thought we should share it with you! If you ever get the urge to go back to Timeless Isle and visit the frogs, there is a nice teleport back to Draenor in the nearby underwater cave. Sitting in the chair and clicking the fire puts you in a remote spot in Gorgrond. Getting to this location in Gorgrond might require the shredder, as it is fairly high up.
