Karazhan - Summoning Nightbane
A community member shared the steps required to summon Nightbane, but asked to remain unnamed. 


After zoning in to the instance you have eight minutes to click the Opera Hall Soul Fragment http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235422-opera-hall-soul-fragment
Clicking the first crystal gives you Medivh's Echo http://www.wowdb.com/spells/234820-medivhs-echo, which lasts eight minutes.
You then need to click Banquet Hall Soul Fragment http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/235419-banquet-hall-soul-fragment, Guest Chambers Soul Fragment http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235418-guest-chambers-soul-fragment, Servant Quarters Soul Fragment http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235421-servant-quarters-soul-fragment, and Curator Soul Fragment http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235417-curator-soul-fragment
Clicking a crystal adds another stack of Medivh's Echo http://www.wowdb.com/spells/229074-medivhs-echo and extends the buff duration by five minutes.
If you don't make it to a crystal in time, you will see a message telling you "The air grows slightly warmer http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/october/airWarm.jpg"
Upon clicking all of the crystals in time, you gain Medivh's Presence http://www.wowdb.com/spells/229077-medivhs-presence and have five minutes to get to Medivh and summon Nightbane. 
You may then repeatedly attempt Nightbane, who drops Smoldering Ember Wyrm http://www.wowdb.com/items/142552-smoldering-ember-wyrm
Defeating Nightbane will also be required to complete No Bones About It http://www.wowdb.com/quests/45296-no-bones-about-it, which rewards the final version of the Violet Seals: Violet Seal of the Grand Magus http://www.wowdb.com/items/142469-violet-seal-of-the-grand-magus. The chain starts with Book Wyrms http://www.wowdb.com/quests/45291-book-wyrms.

Fire Mage - Flame Orb Color
Patch 7.1 allows Fire Mages to hide their flame orbs, but it also makes the color of the flame around the orbs match the artifact appearance color!

Items in Random Battlegrounds
So does blizzard plan on removing all the fun out of a battleground? You can't use anything in them anymore. From rockets to battle standards, even my vender food and bandaids didnt work. 

Is this what the game is now?
We understand a lot of people enjoy using many of these items in battlegrounds and we didn't intend to make them unusable. We have a fix in testing and hope to see it pushed out soon. After the fix has gone live, if there are items that used to work but no longer do, please let us know. Thanks!

Naw example: Im 2150 in 3s atm, if I win a 2s at 1900 do I get the 2150 piece or the 1900 piece?
gear is rewarded based on your rating in that bracket i.e. 2v2 gives gear based on 2v2 rating. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/788881728010018817
