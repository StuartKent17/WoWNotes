The Iron Horde Invades Hellfest 2015<br>
Are you ready to see the Iron Horde go heavy metal? It all started last November, when Grommash&#x2019;s celebration of the lineup announcement for Hellfest 2015 quickly ignited an epic conversation between Warcraft fans and metal fans.<br>

<br>
With over 100.000 attendees, Hellfest (https://www.facebook.com/hellfest) is a massive metal music festival that no true orc would ever want to miss. Last year Grommash and his Iron Horde were too busy getting ready to invade Azeroth and didn&#x2019;t have time for a detour to western France. This year, they are prepared&#x2026;<br>
<br>
So this summer, we&#x2019;ll be there in person to take a closer look at what happens when these two worlds collide &#x2013; and we&#x2019;re looking forward to sharing the results with you.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll have more information soon about what we&#x2019;ll be doing there. Stay tuned because you won&#x2019;t want to miss #WoWAtHellfest 2015!<br>
