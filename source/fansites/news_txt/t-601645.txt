Boubouille2007-08-02, 11:20 PMGood news, the Blizzcon starts tomorrow. Bad news, I probably won't be able to talk about everything, especially the PvP tournament. 

Hopefully, I had a PvP site project scheduled, and I threatened enough people to have it online for the Blizzcon. There will probably be a few bugs but this should be enough to cover the world finals. Feel free to report anything on the PvPScene.com http://www.pvpscene.com forums

On the long run, you'll find results of all WoW PvP competitions here, and enough articles to keep you busy when there isn't anything to cover. Note that PapaShlapa from World Of Papa http://worldofpapa.blogspot.com/ will be writing here now, keeping his blog for infos about the team and a few other things
