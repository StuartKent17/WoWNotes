Legion Developer Q&amp;A Friday, July 29<br>
Join us live on Twitch (http://twitch.tv/Warcraft) Friday, July 29, as we sit down with Senior Game Designer Jonathan LeCraft for our next live developer Q&amp;A. He&#x2019;ll be answering many of your questions on Demon Hunters.<br>
<br>
Feel free to submit any Demon Hunter-specific questions by posting in this forum thread (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20747805530#1) or via Twitter using the hashtag #LegionQA.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re really looking forward to getting the chance to dive in and answer as much as we can, so we hope to see you Friday at 11 a.m. PT!<br>
<br>
About the Legion Live Developer Q&amp;As<br>
Every week or two, we&#x2019;ll be going live on Twitch.tv/Warcraft (http://twitch.tv/Warcraft) to answer questions submitted by the World of Warcraft community. Each Q&amp;A will feature a different developer, and we&#x2019;ll be looking for questions that focus on their particular role on the World of Warcraft development team.<br>
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the New World of Warcraft Site!<br>
Welcome to the new World of Warcraft community site! Consider this your new home for all the latest happenings in and around Azeroth. You&apos;ll want to check out this news feed regularly; we&apos;ll use it to share community highlights, game information, esports coverage, and much more.<br>
<br>
Take a minute to look around and get acquainted with the site, and be sure to come back often. We&apos;ve got a lot in store leading up to the August 30 release of World of Warcraft: Legion, and we look forward to sharing and discussing the latest World of Warcraft news, content, and updates with you for a long time to come.<br>
<br>
Because the site is still new and pieces are still under construction, and you&#x2019;re bound to come across a hiccup or two. If you would like to report an error with the website or provide feedback, please post in the Website Bug Report forum here (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/1025938/). Please note that your characters will not appear in the site search results unless you&#x2019;ve logged into that character within the game as of July 4.<br>
<br>
What&#x2019;s Here<br>
We have a brand new, mobile-friendly home page, game section, guides, and more for you to explore. Whether you&#x2019;re browsing on your desktop or on the go, the new site is designed to be responsive to the device you&#x2019;re viewing it on.<br>
<br>
While you&#x2019;re here exploring the site, you&#x2019;ll also want to check out the updated forums by clicking on Forums at the top of the page. We&#x2019;ve put a new coat of paint on things and tidied up a bit to give the forums a cleaner look. Don&#x2019;t worry, though&#x2014;all of your posts in the current forums will still be here for you when we transition over, so no packing for the move will be necessary.<br>
<br>
Future Updates<br>
We&#x2019;ll be updating player profiles, PvP Ladders, and the Story of Warcraft section on the site in a future update, but you&#x2019;ll still be able to view all of this content within the current site. Items clicked within search results will also be integrated a bit later in the development of the site.<br>
<br>
We hope you enjoy the new site!<br>

Camera and Motion Sickness Issues<br>
First and foremost, please know that this is a topic of discussion and development across multiple teams here. We have teammates who are sensitive to motion sickness. We care very much about making sure playing our game doesn&#x2019;t make you &#x2013; or them &#x2013; feel unwell.<br>
<br>
Although the maximum camera distance changes are the most immediately noticeable, there were several less-apparent changes made to how the camera functions in the pre-expansion patch, and we&#x2019;ve already identified some cases where those changes may be causing issues. Here&#x2019;s a few examples:<br>
<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ve found an issue with camera shake effects, which we&#x2019;re currently working to hotfix (if you&#x2019;ve run Bloodmaul Slag Mines since the patch, you&#x2019;ve likely noticed this one). There was a systemic change to our graphical renderer which changes the way FoV is calculated. Manually resizing the viewable game area (which is usually done via &#x201C;viewport&#x201D; addons) may be affecting the game camera differently than before. We have identified the cause of this issue and are actively addressing it. We&#x2019;re also tracking down some vehicle-related camera bugs.<br>
<br>
We believe that underlying issues like these are the actual source of many of the motion sickness concerns. To that end, if you find yourself feeling ill in-game, examples of where you were and what you were doing at the time would be very useful for helping us track down exactly what&#x2019;s causing the issue, especially if you can provide video footage so that we can see what the camera was doing at the time.<br>
<br>
This issue is very important to us, and we&#x2019;re working hard on investigating and correcting it as quickly as possible. Any examples you can send us are very much appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much.<br>
<br>
Playing now is like having a bobble head camera that bobbles, wiggles and lurches about of its own accord while my character simultaneously moves and the environment around my character is moving changing too so kind a 3 way motion hitting you at once is very disconcerting and for me leads to attacks of vertigo, nausea, headaches and visual issues.<br>
The camera shouldn&apos;t be doing anything like what you describe. There are a few specific new bugs we&apos;re tracking: Vehicle camera tracking can break horribly (Al&apos;Akir&apos;s phase transition is a drastic example of this bug), and flying mounts are banking excessively when turning, as well as causing a camera &quot;pop&quot; when landing. But we&apos;re also wondering whether many of the issues being discussed and reported aren&apos;t the result of something going wrong with interface settings...<br>
<br>
Have you tried typing &quot;/console actioncam off&quot;? Does that help or change anything at all? If you go to Interface -&gt; Camera, what is your &quot;Camera Following Style&quot; set to? Finally, which UI addons, if any, do you use? Is it possible that any of them might be modifying your camera settings?<br>
<br>
<br>
Appearance Unlock Clarifications<br>
We&#x2019;ve been seeing some confusion regarding the restrictions on what appearances a given character can unlock, so we wanted to take a moment to clarify what those restrictions are, and why they are in place.<br>
<br>
In order to unlock an item&#x2019;s appearance, it must:<br>
<br>
Be permanently bound to your character Be equippable by the character that looted it Be of that character&#x2019;s primary armor type (e.g. Cloth, Leather, Mail, Plate)<br>
<br>
Additionally, if a piece of gear drops while you are in a raid or dungeon, the item&#x2019;s appearance will be removed from your collection if you trade it to another party member (in the brief period where that&#x2019;s allowed).<br>
<br>
We require items to be bound to your character because we want only one player to unlock an appearance per item. We don&#x2019;t want to create situations where, say, a group of players passes a BoE item around to everyone, or a raid group has everyone pick up the shiny new sword before the Warrior can have it.<br>
<br>
The restrictions by class, level, and armor type are in place for several reasons, the biggest of which is to make sure that all classes are on a relatively even playing field when it comes to collecting appearances. We don&#x2019;t want everyone who&#x2019;s interested in collecting appearances to feel like they need to roll a Warrior, for example, because they can technically equip all four armor types. If you want to unlock appearances for your Priest, you should always feel like your Priest is the best character to do it on.<br>
<br>
In the end, our goal with this system is to make it easier to fill out your transmog collection without incentivizing unusual or disruptive play habits. As with any system we add to the game, we&#x2019;re planning to keep iterating on this as time goes on, so thanks as always for your feedback.<br>
<br>

FEEDBACK: Royal Athenaeum (Raid Finder)<br>
The second wing of the Nighthold raid zone is now accessible in Raid Finder difficulty, with Spellblade Aluriel, Star Augur Etraeus, and High Botanist Tel&apos;arn active. Please use this thread for feedback. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20747845522?page=1#1))<br>
<br>
Where is Need/Greed?<br>
It&apos;s now called &quot;Group Loot&quot; - it&apos;s an improved version of the old Need/Greed system that automatically prioritizes &quot;mainspec&quot; rolls over &quot;offspec.&quot;<br>
<br>
Round Robin and the old &quot;Group Loot&quot; option were removed in 7.0.3, since they were almost entirely unused. Loot options are now: Group Loot, Master Loot (if in a guild party), Personal Loot, and Free For All. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20747645245?page=1#6))<br>
