How Much More of Dragon Soul?<br>
We don&apos;t have a &quot;filler&quot; Raid planned. We have a wealth of information that we&apos;ve been sharing with the media and press this week that they&apos;ll start sharing with you all next week (Monday, March, 19). While we aren&apos;t going to give you a release date, I think you&apos;ll get a good idea of how far along we are in the development of the expansion. We think you&apos;ll like what you see/hear/read. <br>
<br>
We&apos;ll also be keeping an eye on any and all constructive feedback and answering what we can as development continues.<br>
<br>
We&apos;ll do our best to give everyone as much of a &quot;heads-up&quot; as possible when we do provide a release date. Don&apos;t worry. As always, you&apos;ll see it when you see it. <br>
<br>
There are still a lot of things to do and be done in the game currently beyond Raid content. We generally see people begin to &quot;finish&quot; content they may have not gotten to prior to the release of a new expansion or expansion patch and I think once we start talking about beta and getting people into the beta, we&apos;ll see more people posting about what those things are. There will be a lot more to do when Mists of Pandaria becomes available (new/additional things), that may take your focus from completing some of the things you&apos;re working on (or plan to work on) now. It&apos;s a good time to start thinking about what those things may be. <br>
<br>
I&apos;m not going to hint at how long that may be, so don&apos;t ask. It&apos;s just something to think about. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/218989-seriously-how-much-more-of-dragon-soul/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4175361566?page=6#106))<br>

World of Warcraft Movie <br>
It&apos;s still on the radar. We just don&apos;t have any current updates to provide. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219001-world-of-warcraft-movie/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4175551752#10))<br>

Thunder Bluff in Minecraft<br>
We have previously featured efforts to build Stormwind in Minecraft (Minewind (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUCyDr8E_ko) and Stormwind (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grafSKIOC00)), making it only fair to show off this nice Thunder Bluff build that is in progress. <br>
