Apexis Crystal Bonus Event August 21 â€“ 24
During the Sign of Apexis bonus event, you'll gain bonus Apexis Crystals from eligible creatures. Furthermore, completing the this-bonus event-only quest "The Time to Strike http://www.wowdb.com/quests/39033-the-time-to-strike" awards a sizable amount of Oil to fuel your Naval Missions, in addition to a big pile of Apexis Crystals.

The point of picking up lots and lots of extra Apexis Crystals is, of course, to spend them! Here are some of the possibilities.

For most players, spending Apexis Crystals on gear upgrades is a great way to improve your overall item level. There's something for every slot at item level 650, so if you've still got a low-level item in one or two slots, you're covered. Visit Ravenspeaker Thelnaas http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/96130-ravenspeaker-thelnaas in Tanaan Jungle to buy armor for 5,000 Crystals apiece, a weapon for 10,000 Crystals, and Empowered Apexis Fragments for 20,000 Crystals. Empowered Apexis Fragment http://www.wowdb.com/items/128225-empowered-apexis-fragment are Battle.net Account-bound, and upgrade your Baleful gear from ilvl 650 to ilvl 695.

Some nice new collectibles came along with Tanaan Jungle. You'll want to consider:


Reins of the Corrupted Dreadwing http://www.wowdb.com/items/123974-reins-of-the-corrupted-dreadwing mount 150,000 Apexis Crystals
Rukhmar's Sacred Memory http://www.wowdb.com/items/122283-rukhmars-sacred-memory toy 50,000 Apexis Crystals
Blazing Firehawk http://www.wowdb.com/items/128478-blazing-firehawk pet 2,000 Apexis Crystals
Solar Priest Vayx http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/followers/582-solar-priest-vayx follower 1,000 Apexis Crystals 


The bonus weekend is underway, and runs through the end of the day on Monday, August 24.

What are you aiming to buy with your extra crystals?

Grove Warden Mount
I really hope you're conscious that seeing this mount in the store freaks everyone out concerning legion rep rewards
I'd heard similar feedback before but it was pronounced this time, thanks! I get you. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/633535862551113728

Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Story
As a games designer, do you ever think you would let us, the heroes loose in an expansion!? we cant always win surely 
As a narrative device I think this is fun but you have to sell "won every battle but lost the war." OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/630877148031553537
Because it likely won't be fun for the player to just lose every fight. They still need to win a lot for a sense of satisfaction. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/630877250934583296
Consider Empire Strikes Back: the retreat from Hoth spoiler was a victory but not a victory like driving the Empire back. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/630877491024953345
