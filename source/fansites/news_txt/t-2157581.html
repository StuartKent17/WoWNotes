PTR Build Deploy 1/24/2017<br>
Greetings friends,<br>
PTR will be coming down for a bit today in order to deploy a new 7.2.0 build. No ETA for the push, but I&apos;ll ping this thread if things look like they&apos;re going to take longer than usual after realms go offline. <br>
<br>
Leaving this thread open for general discussion so long as posts remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines. <br>
<br>
Thanks all!<br>

Elite PvP Gear Transmog<br>
Please be sure to read the entire post below. The sets will not be made available. <br>
Honest question. What&apos;s so special about pvp elite gear that it needs to be kept from buying once it&apos;s severely outdated? Mythic/heroic gear in pve can be farmed usually 2 expansions after it happens. I don&apos;t know why pvp gear should be any different, but I might just not understand. I mean most players don&apos;t even know it&apos;s elite gear anyway, so it&apos;s not like it&apos;s being shown off for bragging rights.<br>
Over the years, we&apos;ve received a lot of requests to make the Elite sets from past seasons available. As you said, the PvE versions of these sets can be obtained through Legacy raids. <br>
<br>
We&apos;re considering making Elite transmog ensembles available for purchase with Marks of Honor if your Current Rating in 2v2, 3v3 or RBGs is above some threshold (for illustrative purposes, let&apos;s say 2200). We would love to hear your thoughts about this idea.<br>
<br>
I&apos;d like to clarify one point: we totally hear that you&apos;d like a rating restricted tabard and illusion back. We&apos;re adding a new tabard for Season 3 that will have a rating requirement. We&apos;re debating whether to add a new illusion however. Illusions do not work on artifact weapons and offering a reward that requires you to transmog your weapon feels problematic. But, we get that you really like the illusion. We may settle back on that idea or try to develop something else.<br>
<br>
As for the elite sets, our motivation for doing this isn&apos;t to replace other reward systems. We&apos;ve received a lot of requests to re-add these sets to the game somehow. We thought current rating and a marks of honor cost would be a reasonable gating mechanism for purchase. But the community&apos;s impression on prestige items like this is important. We appreciate all of your feedback on the idea. But we wanted to make it clear that adding these sets does not mean we won&apos;t be adding other rating rewards as well. <br>
<br>
Thanks for the feedback. We have decided to not make these sets available.<br>

Convergence of Fate (and other trinkets)<br>
Draught of Souls unchanged for DPS warriors but reduced by 30% for UH DKS? Guess doing this damage is intended: http://i.imgur.com/L9r13IH.jpg<br>
The damage reduction on Draught of Souls has already been in place for Unholy DK&apos;s. Like I said, it was intended to counteract the fact that Unholy&apos;s Mastery increases Shadow damage (and prevent Draught of Souls from being far and away the most overpowered trinket available to Unholy). This hotfix isn&apos;t reducing Draught&apos;s damage, it&apos;s actually increasing it by about 17%.<br>
<br>
That said, we agree that Draught being so strong for DPS Warriors is a problem. We&apos;re going to look into it some more.

Loaded Dice: New Outlaw Gold feedback<br>
Does it do anything for slice n dice.<br>
If not, it makes the talent obsolete, you don&apos;t want a golden trait to be useless.<br>
The plan is to buff Slice and Dice somehow. As with existing traits, as the 7.2 traits progress along we will look at how they have to interact with replacement talents.

Legion PvP Season 1 Rewards Update<br>
Shortly after last week&#x2019;s re-distribution of PvP rewards, we discovered a bug that had caused Alliance players&#x2019; rewards to be re-distributed based on the Horde ladders. While many players still ended up with the correct reward, some received rewards at a higher or lower tier than they had earned.<br>
<br>
In the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand, this bug resulted in too few rewards being distributed for Alliance players. We&#x2019;ll be applying a hotfix with the next weekly maintenance that will correct this. Alliance players can expect to receive either the same reward they had already received, or one at a higher tier.<br>
<br>
To help provide clarity, here are the final rating cutoffs that were necessary to earn the Gladiator, Vindictive Gladiator, or Hero of the Alliance/Horde titles on these realms in Legion Season 1:<br>
<br>
Horde<br>
Gladiator: 2563<br>
Vindictive Gladiator: 2852<br>
Hero of the Horde: 2432<br>
<br>
Alliance<br>
Gladiator: 2437<br>
Vindictive Gladiator: 2704<br>
Hero of the Alliance: 2297<br>
<br>
Thank you again for your patience as we work to ensure that players are rewarded fairly for their efforts in Legion Season 1.<br>
