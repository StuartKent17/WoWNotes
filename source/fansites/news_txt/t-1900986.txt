Valor and Item Upgradesvaloritems
Valor Points  may be gone, but Valor  returns in Patch 6.2.3! Item upgrades are also back, with two upgrade levels at +5 item levels each. 


You can see a full list of items that can be upgraded here 
Upgrading an item costs 250 Valor  for +5 item levels.
Hellfire Citadel items, Dungeon loot, Baleful items, and crafted profession items can each be upgraded twice, for a total of +10 item levels.
You can upgrade lower tiers of crafted items, not just the highest one. 
There is no hard weekly cap on Valor earned, but the sources of Valor are inherently not infinitely repeatable. You can earn up to 4,875.
There is a cap of 5,000 Valor  that you can hold at once.
Valor can be earned in the following ways:
Mythic Dungeon Valor awarded with dungeon completion, once per dungeon per week – 300 Valor Points
Complete the weekly Event quest from Seer Kazal Pet Battle Event excluded – 500 Valor Points
Heroic Dungeon complete your first random Heroic of the day – 100 Valor Points
Raid Finder once per week per wing – 150 Valor Points for Hellfire Citadel wings, 75 Valor Points for Highmaul and Blackrock Foundry wings

To upgrade, visit your friendly neighborhood ethereal in Orgrimmar and Stormwind, or Stormshield and Warspear.
