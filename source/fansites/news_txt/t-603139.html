Elemental Shaman 2.3<br>
You just keep on trying &apos;til you run out of cake posts. In the end, you get an upgrade for all the elemental shamans who are still alive.<br>
Elemental shaman were told that while we&apos;d be nerfing the damage coefficients for lightning bolt and chain lightning bolt in patch 2.3, overall they&apos;d notice a damage increase. We know most of your tests reveal a damage decrease, however. We&apos;ve been running extensive tests of our own and have identified that there is approximately a 6% nerf to elemental dps (depending on gear of course). As a result, we&apos;re going to increase lightning bolt and chain lightning bolt&apos;s coefficient so that elemental shaman gain approximately 5 to 6% of their damage back if you assume roughly 1200 spell damage.<br>
<br>
It should break down as follows<br>
If you have below 1100 spell damage you will see a slight buff to your dps<br>
If you are between 1100 and 1200 spell damage you should see neither a decrease or increase to your dps<br>
If you are over 1200 spell damage you will see a slight nerf to your dps.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This change should be hotfixed onto the PTR at some point soon, and we&apos;ll be watching the situation closely. <br>

2vs2 is unfair<br>
There already was a similar post a few days ago, but this one definitely confirms that they don&apos;t really plan to do anything to balance 2vs2 arenas. <br>
I&apos;m not saying you&apos;re wrong. There are a number of changes, adjustments, and tweaks that could be made to make warlocks less powerful in smaller scale PvP ... but by your logic alone we can say that the strength of warlocks is diminished as the scale of the PvP increases.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s right that warlocks should be so powerful as a solo class simply because the balance is aimed somewhere else, but that&apos;s the way it is and it has been said that little to no balancing will be done for 1vs1 or 2vs2 scenarios. It was even announced recently that there was almost not going to be a 2vs2 arena due to balance concerns.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that warlocks are a powerful solo class - but I don&apos;t remember anyone claiming that they would be anything else and it is only natural that some of that powerful solo ability would transfer across to solo PvP, even if it was originally intended to be a PvE strength.<br>

There is currently a bug causing leadership to be passed around for no discernible reason, it&apos;s being investigated and hopefully fixed in an upcoming patch. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2856018238&amp;postId=28556724094&amp;sid=1#7))<br>
