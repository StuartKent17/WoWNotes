Sorry guys, you&apos;re not getting additional premades. <br>
US Test Server II (US PVP) is not going to be available for 2.2.2 testing. <br>
<br>
Any characters that were copied to this server will be unavailable. We apologize for any confusion or inconvenience. <br>
<br>
UPDATE: There are currently no plans to reset pre-mades or character copies. If this changes an announcement will be made.<br>

Brewfest guide<br>
I made a few updates to the brewfest guide, and added a few explanations about some quests (like the daily part of &quot;There and Back Again&quot;). See below.<br>
Also, the goggles you can buy for 100 tickets will change players into female orcs for horde players, not gnomes. (See the screenshots, thanks to joyu)<br>

Wowhead forums<br>
Wowhead opened their forums, you can either flood (no, don&apos;t, or they&apos;ll break my legs) the general discussion forum. There is also a suggestion forum up, and it&apos;s fairly interesting to see that kind of forum on an item database site. <br>
