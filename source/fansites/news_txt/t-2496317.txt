Stoy2019-07-09, 12:39 PMBattle for Azeroth Season 3 Live This Week
Season 3 begins today, bringing with it reward changes, Azshara's Eternal Palace raid, Operation: Mechagon mega dungeon, a new Mythic+ season/affix, and a new PvP season!

Content Difficulty and Rewards Changes
With a new raid opening, the item level of many rewards are going up!


New Maximum Item Level: The maximum possible item level will go up to 455.
Azshara's Eternal Palace: Gear from the new raid will range from LFR - 400, Normal - 415, Heroic - 430, Mythic - 445
World Quest Emissary Rewards: On the PTR, World Quest item rewards ranged from 380 to 400 for a geared character. Azerite Armor was item level 385 from world quests and 415 as the max from emissaries.
Dungeon Rewards and Difficulty: The item level of rewards from max-level Normal, Heroic, and Mythic dungeons will go up by 30. Baseline rewards will be 370 from Normal, 385 from Heroic, and 400 from non-Keystone Mythic. The new Mythic Only Dungeon Operation: Mechagon will have 415 baseline item level gear.
Mythic Keystone Dungeons: Mythic+ rewards will also go up by 30 item levels. As with Season 2, during the first week of Season 3 Mythic Keystone Dungeon rewards will most likely be capped at item level 415 420 on the PTR. Mythic Keystones from your weekly chest today will likely go down by 4 levels instead of 1 when the transition occurs. The chest you open on the first week of season 3 will contain Season 2 rewards if you did a Mythic+ run on the last week of Season 2. So, for example, if you did a Mythic 10 during the final week of Season 2, you will get a Season 2 item level 410 piece and 600 Residuum from your first Season 3 chest today.
PvP: PvP Season 3 end-of-match rewards will also most likely be capped at 415 420 on PTR for the first week of the season. Rewards from rated PvP sources are 30 item levels higher than they were in Season 2, including Conquest rewards and the weekly chest.
Seals of Wartorn Fate: Seals of Wartorn Fate are not being reset and this same currency can be used for Azshara's Eternal Palace and Season 3 bonus rolls; the cap on how many can be held at once remains at 5.


New Raid - Azshara's Eternal Palace
Normal and Heroic Azshara's Eternal Palace opens this week, with Mythic and Raid Finder item level 380 required opening next week.

New Mega Dungeon - Operation: Mechagon
A new eight boss mega dungeon is coming with unique gear and rewards to earn. There is also a way to activate a hard mode of the dungeon which will likely give a unique challenge and reward similar to the Nightbane run in Legion Karazhan.

Once you’re feeling properly upgraded, it’s time to begin your bid to shut down King Mechagon once and for all and free the mechagnomes from his tyranny. Get ready for Operation Mechagon!

Operation Mechagon 


https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/june/thumb/operationmechthumb.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/june/operationmech.jpg 

Prince Erazmin leads a group of unlikely allies on a desperate mission into the heart of Mechagon. In a race against time, they must overcome King Mechagon’s army of mechanized monstrosities and defeat the mad genius before his doomsday device purges all organic life from Azeroth.

Dungeon Bosses: 8

Difficulties: Mythic

Level: 120 for Alliance and Horde

King Gobbamak: Obsessed with hoarding dangerous technology found amongst the scrap, King Gobbamak sits upon a pile of doomsday weapons that he lacks the intelligence to operate or understand.

Gunker: After years of coalescing into a concentrated cesspool. Mechagon's toxic waste has gained malevolent sentience. With the sanitation systems disabled, Gunker is free to ooze across all of Azeroth.

Trixie & Naeno: Trixie and Naeno, two of Bondo’s top lieutenants, have a turbulent relationship. While Trixie prides herself on ruthless efficiency, Naeno is the embodiment of chaos while behind the wheel. The only thing they have in common is their penchant for senseless violence, which they enjoy dispensing on anyone foolish enough to wander into their territory.

HK-8 Aerial Oppression Unit: Predator of the skies, the HK-8 Aerial Oppression Unit soars over the yard executing its prime directive, disintegrating all trespassers. With impenetrable armor and a lethal host of weapons, it annihilates all who are caught in its shadow.

Tussle Tonks: Mechagon’s premier mechgineers test their mettle and metal by building customized combat robots. While these tonks typically battle each other for glory, they combine their efforts to repel foolhardy organic intruders who dare venture into Mechagon.

K.U.-J.O.: As the repository for the city’s refuse, the Under Junk is a prime target for gnomes from Bondo’s gang who intend to steal valuable mechanical components. While Trash Mistress Wendy Cogsworth ceaselessly sorts the city’s junk, her loyal guard dog, K.U.-J.0., keeps out unwelcome intruders—mechagnomes and adventurers alike.

Machinist's Garden: Beautiful and dangerous, Head Machinist Sparkflux's metallic gardens are designed for both recreation and retribution. With a flick of a switch, the idyllic scenery transforms into a death trap from which no interloper can escape.

King Mechagon: As maniacal as he is brilliant, King Mechagon despises all organic life. With his mechoriginator primed and ready, nothing stands in the way of his scheme to purge the curse of flesh from Azeroth and mechanize the entire world.

Get ready to face the danger within beginning July 9.


Dungeon Changes
Rewards and difficulty are being buffed with the start of Season 3.


The new seasonal affix is Beguiling https://www.wowdb.com/affixes/119-beguiling!

Azshara's Emissaries are present throughout the dungeon.

These emissaries will be placed in different trash packs each week.
These emissaries do not die, but teleport away based on certain conditions.
As of now they are affected by affixes, but do not give bolstering to other mobs when defeated.
Removing them from the battle does progress the enemy forces bar.

Emissary of the Tides

Queen's Decree: Unstoppable https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/302418-queens-decree-unstoppable - The Queen's Decree make all nearby allies immune to all non-damage effects.
Queen's Decree: Unstoppable https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/302417-queens-decree-unstoppable - Grants nearby allies Queen's Decree: Unstoppable.
Will teleport when brought to 1 health.

Enchanted Emissary

Queen's Decree: Blowback https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/290027-queens-decree-blowback - Grants nearby allies Queen's Decree: Blowback, reflecting 150% of damage dealt back at the target.
Queen's Decree: Blowback https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/290026-queens-decree-blowback - Reflects 150% of damage dealt back at the target.
Attacks will knock the Enchanted Emissary back.
Will teleport when her energy bar is empty.

Void-Touched Emissary

Queen's Decree: Hide https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/302420-queens-decree-hide - Deals Shadow damage equal to 50% targets' health to enemies in line of sight within a 60 yard radius.
Queen's Decree: Hide https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/302421-queens-decree-hide - Increases Shadow damage dealt by 50%.
Can see through Stealth and Invisibility.
Will teleport when brought to 1 health.


The item level of rewards from max-level Normal, Heroic, and Mythic dungeons will go up by 30. Baseline rewards will be 370 from Normal, 385 from Heroic, and 400 from non-Keystone Mythic. The Operation: Mechagon mega dungeon has baseline 415 item level rewards.
Mythic + dungeon scaling is now 10% per level instead of 8%.
Mythic Keystones will go down by an additional 3 levels when the season transition occurs to account for the difficulty increase. So if you did an 11 the last week of season 2, expect a level 7 key instead of a 10 in your chest when the new season starts.
Mythic+ rewards will also go up by 30 item levels; however, during the first week of Season 3, rewards from end-of-run mythic+ chests will likely be capped at item level 415 420 on PTR. The chest you open on the first week of season 3 will contain Season 2 rewards if you did a Mythic+ run on the last week of Season 2. So, for example, if you did a Mythic 10 during the final week of Season 2, you will get a Season 2 item level 410 piece and 600 Residuum from your first Season 3 chest today.
The weekly cache that becomes available in the second week of the season will not be affected by this cap. If a player does a Mythic 10 dungeon during this coming week, they will get a Mythic 10 reward from their cache the following week.



Titan Residuum

Titan Residuum https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-titan-residuum will still be rewarded from Mythic+ weekly chests, occasional Treasure Map missions, and by scrapping or disenchanting Azerite armor.
Titan Residuum https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-titan-residuum is not reset or capped between seasons.
Titan Residuum https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-titan-residuum awarded from your weekly cache will increase proportionately.
Thaumaturge Vashreen https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/149045-thaumaturge-vashreen will offer item level 415, 430, and 445 pieces for sale in Season 3.

Random 415 - 1,725 Titan Residuum https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-titan-residuum
Random 430 - 9,000 Titan Residuum https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-titan-residuum
Random 445 - 47,500 Titan Residuum https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-titan-residuum
Specific 445 - 200,000 Titan Residuum https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-titan-residuum




Battle for Azeroth PvP Season 3
PvP Season 3 will start today with all new rewards and gear to earn.


PvP Season 3 end-of-match rewards will also most likely be capped at 415 420 on PTR for the first week of the season. Rewards from rated PvP sources are 30 item levels higher than they were in Season 2, including Conquest rewards and the weekly chest.

Heroic Battle for Stromgarde Warfront
Season 3 introduces Heroic Warfronts.


Initially heroic is only available for Battle for Stromgarde.
Heroic Warfronts are tuned for item level 415.
A team of 10 to 20 will be needed to que for a Heroic Warfront.
Heroic Warfronts will be much different from normal warfronts.
Heroic Warfronts will focus on the strategic aspects found in RTS games. Examples of new challenges include special units sent at your base that needs to be defended, the enemy commander appearing on the field, or where to best put resources at the moment.
You can lose a Heroic Warfront.
