Mythic Dungeon Invitational - Welcome to the Proving Grounds
The Mythic Dungeon International https://worldofwarcraft.com/news/22862590/ MDI, a seasonal competition that showcases the world’s best dungeon-running teams, is about to begin! An invitational no more, this program is designed so that as many people as possible can participate.

The first Proving Grounds of 2019 will run from February 26 PST through March 12 PST when the dungeons reset in your region. This is the first stage of the MDI – to move on to the Time Trials stage, all you and your team need to do is complete five different level 14 Mythic Keystone Dungeons in time during that period. That’s it!

Schedule for Affixes during Proving Grounds:

Feb 26 - Mar 4 - Tyrannical, Bursting, Skittish, Reaping
Mar 5 - Mar 12 - Fortified, Teeming, Quaking, Reaping


Once you’ve done that, head on over to the MDI sign-up page https://mythicdungeoninvitational.wufoo.com/forms/m154hh9q1s6vx23/ and provide all the information we need to verify your runs, so we can get you and your teammates onto the Tournament Realm.

The Tournament Realm will act as your kind of dungeon-running sandbox. On this realm, you will be able to create max-level characters, select your armor and weapon from a range of options, grab some potions and flasks, and build out your talents as you please.

The Tournament Realm is also the place where we’ll be running the Time Trials for MDI East and MDI West, where you’ll have the chance to see how you stack up alongside the competition. We’ll give you more information about the Time Trials as we get closer.

To see if you're eligible to participate in the Proving Grounds, check out the 2019 MDI official ruleset https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/HUUQ8ZVJYUZ11550876869874.pdf!
