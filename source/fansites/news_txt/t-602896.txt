Battlegrounds daily quests
Seems that the 2000 Honor points on the AV Daily quest was indeed a bug .... It is now 4000. ^^
Update : Eye Of The Storm too.

 
 


Zul'aman
You now need 5 players to start the even in Zul'aman. as mentionned in this blue post 

Also, more Zul'aman recolors, I guess it's pretty much complete, thanks to bas  for his awesome post. 


   


Sound issues
Hardware sound is back, I guess you should really connect on the PTR if you had sound issues before, and report on test realm forums if it's not resolved yet. 


Azure Whelpling
As mentioned in the patch notes, you can now drop an Azure Whelpling on elite blue drakes in Azshara, we now have a nice screenshot of it, thanks to Bellacoro
