Sound issues
Hardware sound is back, I guess you should really connect on the PTR if you had sound issues before, and report on test realm forums if it's not resolved yet. 


Azure Whelpling
As mentioned in the patch notes, you can now drop an Azure Whelpling on elite blue drakes in Azshara, we now have a nice screenshot of it, thanks to Bellacoro http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=1983.0
