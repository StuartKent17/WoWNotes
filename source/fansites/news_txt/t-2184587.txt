PTR Development Notes - Build 23753
This week’s PTR update contains mostly tuning changes, which include some of the mechanisms around the Broken Shore, but also a large round of adjustments to Legendary items. These adjustments are part of our overall goal to bring Legendaries more in line with each other in terms of value, particularly in how their benefits apply to your primary role tanking, DPS, or healing.

This first round of adjustments is not comprehensive - in fact, we’ve already made some additional changes since this build was put together, and we expect tuning to continue as part of an ongoing process. Still, we’d greatly appreciate your feedback on these changes, as well as on any other Legendaries that are still in need of tuning. We’ve created a separate thread here with more details on exactly what changes have been made.

Thanks, and happy testing!


PTR Build Deploy 3/14/2017
Greetings all,
PTR Realms will be coming down today in order to deploy a new 7.2.0 build. No ETA for today's push but I'll ping the thread if things look like they're going to take longer than usual.

As always, I'll leave this thread open for discussion so long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines. 

Thanks for your patience everyone!
