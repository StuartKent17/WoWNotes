MagicFind2019-06-18, 05:17 PMThe Eternal Palace Raid Preview and Schedule
Face Queen Azshara’s most devoted champions in an epic new raid—The Eternal Palace.

Ten thousand years ago, as the seas engulfed Zin-Azshari, Queen Azshara forged a dark bargain with N’Zoth that transformed her loyal subjects into the sinister naga. Through millennia of brutal conquest, Azshara has built a new empire from the ruins of the old and now holds dominion over the depths that once threatened to claim her. Ever the gracious host, she has invited the Alliance and Horde alike into her eternal palace to witness her glorious ascension… and their ultimate demise.

Blackwater Behemoth
Summoned from depths unknown, the Blackwater Behemoth lurks in an abyss so dark that not even the naga dare to venture into it. Only Azshara is capable of taming the beast, and she has trained it to faithfully guard her treasures.

Radiance of Azshara
Using her handmaiden as a willing sacrifice, Azshara has forged into being an elemental of storm and arcana. Powered by the soul of the devoted vassal, the resulting monstrosity is the avatar of Azshara’s radiance.
