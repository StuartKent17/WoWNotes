Patch 8.2 PTR - Caverns of Time Portal Added to Stormwind Portal Room
The latest version of the PTR added a Caverns of Time Portal to the Stormwind Portal Room. As of now it is unusable. There is currently not one implemented in the Orgrimmar Portal Room, but they will definitely find a place for it!

Clarification on the “Against Overwhelming Odds” Quest Reward
There is currently a display error which is causing some characters that are eligible to receive the “Against Overwhelming Odds” quest to see an incorrect item level listed as the reward. However, the rewards are working as intended. Azerite rewards are now meant to be item level 400 and non-Azerite rewards are now meant to be item level 395. The quest chooses one at random for each character. Thank you for your patience as we work to resolve this issue and have the correct item level displayed.

As an additional note, when Rise of Azshara releases, this quest will be removed from a character’s quest log if it hasn’t been turned in before it becomes unavailable during a Tuesday morning weekly reset.
