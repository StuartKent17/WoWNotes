Blue Posts

Increasing the crit rating on plate to compensate the crit given by agi
Warriors don't need to have the same amount of crit as rogues to do the same or sometimes higher damage. The only risk is that rogues who scale both AP and crit from Agi will end up doing higher damage with extreme gear levels, but usually we have the opposite problem. In any case, at extreme gear levels crit often becomes less and less valuable.

We balance warriors around wearing plate. When they can then wear leather and do higher damage and who can blame them for making choices that maximize their dps?, that presents a problem and the solution is often to nerf warrior damage, which then hurts the guys actually wearing plate. We need to finally fix this design flaw, which we're doing in two ways: itemizing leather the way we itemize plate i.e. just Agi rather than Agi and AP and giving warriors more of a benefit for wearing plate.

Nerfing Mortal Strike debuffs
Yeah I don't think we could nerf MS on live without also nerfing healing, which obviously makes it more than just a quick fix. Source

Holy Paladins can't equip Daggers
Well, it's more complicated than that of course. You aren't competing with priests and druids for your shields and nothing is stopping you from equipping a spell sword if you don't need the Spirit. A caster axe isn't off the table, but it would be pretty uncommon. Source

Dual Wield Talent
We're not quite ready to talk about it yet, but imagine that the DW talent is accesible to Enhance early enough to be useful but not to Elemental and Resto. We're also looking at making enchants unique, which would let us drop the WF internal cooldown low enough that fast weapons might be more attractive. Source
