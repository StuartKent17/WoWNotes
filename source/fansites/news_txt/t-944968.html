DREAM Paragon (http://www.paragon.fi/articles/10-vs-25-comparison) posted an interesting comparison of the Firelands Raid 10 and 25-Man fights (http://www.paragon.fi/articles/10-vs-25-comparison) on their site. This is probably a good read for guilds wondering if it&apos;s time to switch to 10-man because things are feeling harder, and all the 10-man raids out there can most likely steal their setup if they feel like they&apos;re struggling on something. <br>

DREAM Paragon&apos;s conclusion on differences between 10-man and 25-Man<br>
It&apos;s immediately obvious that there&apos;s a much greater degree of clarity and control in the 10-mans. Thinking logically, this should help quite a lot with the learning curve and avoiding mistakes, but that&apos;s not really something we could say our little skirmish &apos;proved&apos; in practice. We already knew what the encounters were about and what the flame to avoid looked like -- relearning to accommodate differences is very different than learning from scratch.<br>
<br>
A theme of more significance that you can clearly see in the three harder bosses for this tier is that the dps requirement is much too lenient in 10-man. This means that you don&apos;t really have to cut the amount of healers, which ensures relaxed gameplay for the healers while about half of their 25-man brethren are taking beta blockers just to be able to see clearly. The other half is naturally on the bench, sitting out for the extra dps. Perhaps this is a backlash from what we&apos;ve been hearing about T11, but it really doesn&apos;t work as it is.<br>
<br>
Proper tuning has repercussions though, since class balance has a huge impact when you&apos;re forced into two-heal and solo heal situations. And that&apos;s not even a stretch -- don&apos;t be surprised if you see a druid solo healing Ragnaros 10 hc before this tier is over. Might or might not happen, but at least it seemed plausible enough. Try doing that with a shaman. <br>
<br>
This leads us to the fact that the gap between an optimal setup and the wrong setup seems to be quite a bit larger in 10-man than in 25s. If the encounters are really hard, you&apos;ll need a proper setup. Guilds shooting for a world first should always be expected to come up with one, but those below, the ones without alt raids, will be left hanging. If the encounters are tuned for the &apos;average&apos; setup, guilds who can afford the optimal one will steamroll through them.<br>
<br>
If we were really playing 10-man, we *would* have a close to optimal setup. Even right now, scaled down from 25 to 10, we would have about 14 players and 30-ish fully raid-capable characters. The difficulty and tuning we&apos;re concerned about is for that scenario, not for the level where you&apos;re simply enjoying the game with the hand you&apos;ve been dealt.<br>
