Cataclysm Hotfixes - Updated Jan. 6<br>
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm.

We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.<br>

<br>
Ghouls do not gain Shadow Infusion when Death Coil is cast during the preparation phase of an Arena or rated Battleground match, making it impossible to use Dark Transformation before the game starts. Shadow Infusion and Dark Transformation both work normally after the preparation phase.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Hunters can no longer sometimes activate multiple aspects at once through the use of Camouflage. Very sneaky.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Paladins using Divine Shield are now able to cast on targets within the same Smoke Bomb effect area, as well as heal others.<br>
<br>

<br>
Casting Flash Heal while under the effects of both Surge of Light and Inner Focus will now only consume Surge of Light.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Warriors can no longer teleport when using Charge with the Tahret Dynasty Mallet.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br>
The Bastion of Twilight<br>
<br>
It is no longer possible to outrange the Halfus Wyrmbreaker drakes without being attacked by melee. The drakes now reposition themselves correctly in order to regain the capability to melee the target.<br>
Twilight Phase-Twister&apos;s Twist Phase ability now has an initial cast delay of 7 seconds, up from 5, and a cast time of roughly 8 seconds, up from 6.<br>
<br>
<br>
Blackrock Caverns<br>
<br>
The Evolution aura during the Corla encounter now displays its warning visual on players at 74 stacks, instead of 82.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deadmines<br>
<br>
Shapeshifted characters should no longer be unable to jump on the rope during the Vanessa VanCleef encounter. They will now be pulled out of a shapeshift form automatically. In addition, players should no longer lose pets when jumping on the rope (they will respawn when the player lands after swinging). Please note that until a client-side patch can be applied, an inappropriate aura will be displayed when pet classes or shapeshifted characters use the rope. The tooltip of this aura will read &quot;Delicious Aura (UNUSED REUSE) / Instant / Delicious food increases haste by 10%&quot; and can be disregarded, as it does not provide a haste buff. It&apos;s an aura of free word association... Enjoy!<br>
<br>
<br>
Lost City of the Tol&apos;vir<br>
<br>
Tamed Tol&apos;vir Prowlers now have regular loot and Skinning tables, instead of epic-quality loot.<br>
<br>
<br>
Throne of the Four Winds<br>
<br>
Al&apos;akir&apos;s Static Shock now does 5,000 damage and only interrupts the spell the player is casting at that moment. It doesn&apos;t lock out the caster and only casts every 5 seconds or so.<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Darkmoon Card: Tsunami now properly procs Giant Wave when basic heal-over-time spells are cast.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

Strand of the Ancients<br>
<br>
Demolishers now spawn at about the same moment that the boats reach the docks in the second round.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tol Barad<br>
<br>
If a player is already in Tol Barad and does not join the battle, the player will be ported back to the camp.<br>
Using /afk ejects players out of the raid and back to the camp.<br>
Entering Tol Barad via the bridge during an active battle by joining the queue will port the player to the correct starting place of the battle, but players who do not join the queue will be ported back to the camp.<br>
Both the Hellscream&apos;s Reach Battle Standard and the Baradin&apos;s Wardens Battle Standard now have a 10-minute cooldown.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quests &amp; Creatures<br>
Tol Barad<br>
<br>
The spawn rates of all three Tol Barad quest micro dungeons have been adjusted to a more reasonable level. This should alleviate the issues players were having with creatures respawning too quickly.<br>
The escorted Farson Keep Prisoner for the quest &quot;Walk A Mile In Their Shoes&quot; no longer engages in combat with opposing faction players.<br>
<br>
<br>
Twilight Highlands<br>
<br>
If reinforcements are not called after 60 seconds, Skullcrusher the Mountain will now despawn. When reinforcements are called, Skullcrusher no longer improperly despawns.<br>
