GC said &quot;if don&apos;t want to multi DoT, don&apos;t play Shadow Priest&quot;. Now I think - is there any ranged class that doesnt multidot?<br>
Some are more multi-DoT heavy than others. Mages in WoD won&apos;t multi-DoT at all (Well, technically, Pyro&apos;s DoT could be multi-DoTed.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411959846640967681))<br>
Elemental is also fairly light on multi-DoTing. Not zero, but relatively little, compared to Shadow/Balance/Affliction. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411960431872180224))<br>
How about Destruction and Demonology, are they hit with multi dotting options now you only mention Affliction?<br>
Multi-DoTing is a core Warlock attribute; all specs will include it to some extent, Affliction most of all. Basically same as now (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/412297033043566592))<br>
<br>
What is the reasoning behind having Rogues and other classes who dual wield have white attacks still be missable in WoD? 1/2<br>
It keeps DW balanced with 2H. If we were to remove it, we&apos;d have to reduce the damage of 1Hs or 1H attacks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411718347147845632))<br>
If OH white weapon damage was reduced instead of missing, would that solve the &quot;bad feeling&quot; of seeing misses?<br>
OH hits currently hit for 50%. Would you rather they hit for 25%? That&apos;s what it&apos;d take. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411949143846694912))<br>
<br>
WoD Vengeance: Why not have abilities just go to the DK&apos;s % of damage over the last 5 seconds and do away with the wierd buff?<br>
Mechanically, 5sec vs 20sec is one difference. Also smoothing. You don&apos;t think the hidden dmg-taken-last-5sec is weirder? (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411181970194837504))<br>
No. I think a stacking AP buff but only for certain spells, which is only caused by some attacks, just feels overcomplicated.<br>
It won&apos;t be an AP buff anymore. We also MAY not need the Vengeance on Taunts anymore either, or the bump to 50% of expected. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411334196406149120))<br>
But you&apos;re still keeping the +100% threat during Taunt&apos;s fixate period right?<br>
200%, but yeah. That&apos;s what MAY make it OK to remove those two things. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411403663777603584))<br>
<br>
hello, i wonder if all the healers will have their mana pool locked in WoD like in MoP. pls no.<br>
What is it that you liked about variable mana pools, besides just seeing the number get bigger? (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414951087452348416))<br>
Compared to being able to cast 6 fireballs for example instead of 4 before running out of mana.<br>
But that never actually played out in practice, right? Mana pools have never been small enough that they were the limiter. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414956499874500609))<br>
<br>
Have you considered making catch-all icons for tier talents that reflect current choice? Macros for it are unwieldy.<br>
Yes, going to try to make more talent rows work like Mage Bomb in terms of sharing a button. Can&apos;t do so in all cases, but most. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414611786713681920))<br>
Great news, thanks!<br>
Sure. It works for things like Priest 90 or Monk 30. Not so well for things like Rogue 90. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414623243966767104))<br>

any chance of druids not losing model change effects from toys when shifting forms? Already works ok in ragefire scenario<br>
Current tech needs major rework for it to happen universally. Those scenarios took tons of ridiculous scripting and spells. T_T (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/417351857401368576))<br>

1st Merry Xmas, 2nd how will dots work for balance druids with the change to snapshot? I&apos;m referring to eclipse as a dmg mofier.<br>
Eclipses&apos; effects will snapshot on Moonfire/Sunfire. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/415955584291049472))<br>
How will the mechanic change to make up for that? One of the few snapshots left. Won&apos;t balance DPS be very swingy?<br>
Perhaps a misunderstanding? I&apos;m saying that it&apos;ll stay as it is today. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416686742318505984))<br>
So Sunfire and Moonfire will still snapshot haste, crit and eclipse buffs?<br>
No, Eclipse will. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416745461551071233))<br>
<br>
- how do you feel the Glyph of Efflo is working? Are we going to see it kept in place for WoD, or should we expect changes?<br>
We like the concept. It&apos;s probably too powerful for something so passive, so we may adjust tuning. That goes for all healers in general though; we want to time down passive healing and smart healing across the board. Most healing should come from actives.

Dear Santa: please give us tameable mantid tanks and pterodactyls in the near future. Wait, Christmas has already passed? Dang..<br>

I&apos;m fairly sure many hunters would love it if you looked into it! How about mantid tanks? Any chance for those? /nervousface<br>
I&apos;d say it&apos;s unlikely for a few reasons, but who knows! (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/417353694288424960))<br>
Addendum: Not that I&apos;m unappreciative of your answer Just curious. Love silithids; would take mantid tanks over anything.<br>
Hunter pets are an odd thing &amp; a source of internal debate. I&apos;ll admit to not understanding/agreeing w/ some allowed &amp; unallowed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/417358150056960001))<br>

I&apos;m a hunter player for 5 years now.I know you ain&apos;t heading for a revamp though i need to ask will MM/SV/BM feel different?<br>
That is precisely our goal. We don&apos;t think that requires a &quot;revamp&quot; or &quot;overhaul&quot;. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414890362209959937))<br>

But saying stuff like &quot;Frost Mages do not scale well with gear because they experience many low % soft-caps.&quot; Is okay, right?<br>
Almost. Softcaps reduce scaling rate, but that says nothing of whether the scaling rate was OP before, or if the difference is significant. In Frost&apos;s case, the next secondary is close in value, so its effect is minor, and their scaling prior to that was higher than normal, because we expect most high end Frost mages to hit that early soft cap. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410895553447206912))<br>
even it comes with some sort of nerf to balance things out. these are frost &quot;scaling&quot; problems as i see them<br>
Having only some of your spells scale with some stats isn&apos;t a problem though, as long as the stats stay... (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411784892779745280))<br>

Most of the issue you&apos;re talking about is caused by the Legendary Metagem. 20% haste was a mistake; caps GCDs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411950096868065281))<br>

Might I ask what the design concept for WW Monks was? Main curiosities, Touch of Karma, their healing, and mobility+raw damage<br>
I wasn&apos;t here, but I think the fantasy of being a monk is using mystical martial arts to damage &amp; dismantle your opponent. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413085269433122816))<br>
<br>
Any closer to fixing WW monks hitbox? It&apos;s been our biggest problem since MOP release with hundreds of threads complaining.<br>
We heard that early on, and investigated and found no evidence of it actually existing. It&apos;s how WoW handles latency for all melee (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417078610185297920))<br>
<br>
.Given the changes to Mistweaving/fistweaving you discussed before, will this also change based upon healing stances?<br>
Mistweavers will count as melee, regardless of stance. Don&apos;t want them afraid to swap between stances. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/412679608182390784))<br>

Will Sacred Shield ever be made more useful for Ret Paladins PvP? A simple 10% buff and allowing it be used on 2 targets would do.<br>
We made a lot of effort to change that row in 5.2 and 5.4. It&apos;s tough to balance those spells for the 3 specs. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/411014244377690112))<br>

IMO, Deep Healing would be good as a situational/optional talent, but too situational for a mastery<br>

Warrior haste: why not let it increase rage generated by rage gen abilities. MS = 10r* haste%. Works for all specs. Unbuff conv.<br>
That&apos;s one option that we&apos;re considering to make haste valuable for Warriors. It &apos;feels&apos; a little weird, but OK. Feedback welcome. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417387244970708992))<br>

I think impossible is a strong word here but I don&apos;t deny the inequity here. Reshuffling it in WoD to be mostly defensive CDs. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/412400200355827712))<br>
