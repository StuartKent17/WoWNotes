Even if the models for all the classes aren&apos;t released yet I got a LOT of requests for multi-race screenshot of the existing tier 10 armor sets models. There isn&apos;t much to report today so I took the time to do it, hopefully we&apos;ll see a new PTR build tonight. <br>
<br>
Important: They&apos;re super-early PTR models and even if they shouldn&apos;t change too much the helms covering beards/tusks/ears might be different on PTR and live servers, be careful with that. (That&apos;s why I don&apos;t usually do multi-race screenshots so early) <br>
<br>
Also, the small error in the DK Male screenshot is obviously intended and here to check if you pay attention. *coughs*<br>
