World PvP
This is a topic we've been discussing a lot recently. We agree that damage feels rather high in World PvP situations and we're considering some changes. First, we removed base resilience coming into Legion because we adjusted the rate at which health pools scale with respect to damage. In the past, player damage tended to outpace a character's health pool making damage feel stronger as an expansion went on. We made some adjustments to that system but we've found through playtesting with the templates that we've had to decrease damage and increase health to get damage pacing to a good spot.

In a future patch, we're considering adding in some base resilience to bring damage and health ratios closer to where they are with our pvp templates and the adjusting those templates to compensate. It should make for better damage pacing in the outside world. We don't plan on activating templates in the outside world though. We think it's important that the game have a place where we don't make such drastic adjustments so you can feel your character's full power when fighting another player. Meanwhile, battlegrounds and arenas provide a much more structured environment for PvP gameplay. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

PTR Update: Legionfall War Supplies
We've made the following update on the PTR:


The Broken Shore Rare Elites 16 bosses now drop 5 Legionfall War Supplies for every kill for any players on their tap list.


Once you're done with the new World Quests, you can acquire Legionfall War Supplies from Rare Elites such as Doombringer Zar'thoz or Malorus the Soulkeeper.

Thank you for the good feedback! Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
You used to be the punching bag of the WoW community now the duty has fallen onto Holinka, what made you guys the target?
Players knew our names. 

My boss during my WoW days, Tom “Kalgan” Chilton, is one of the smartest systems designers I’ve ever worked with. Even though many WoW players knew his name, he perhaps wisely kept a pretty low profile on social media. So, he never got nearly as much attention good or bad from the community.

Brian and Chadd and I are more interested in reaching out to players, but as a result, they sometimes know a name to put with a design change, even if the change was made by some other designer who they didn’t know.

Morello was lead designer on League for a time, and he had similar experiences. In fact, I think the first time we ever met was because players pointed out how we served similar roles, as main tank for community sentiment. Source
