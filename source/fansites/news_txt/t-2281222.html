Some New Blue Faces<br>
Over the coming weeks, you&#x2019;ll be seeing some new Blue accounts posting here in the forums. These fine folks are joining on to help us be more present and active in discussions with you all.<br>
<br>
Our new additions will be labeled &#x201C;Forum Engagement.&#x201D; While these people are Blizzard employees, they aren&#x2019;t game designers and won&#x2019;t be able to answer those deeper questions about topics like game balance. And no worries; you&#x2019;ll still see the same names you recognize.<br>
<br>
Thanks for giving them a warm welcome!<br>

Draenor Pathfinder<br>
While at this point in time we don&apos;t have any plans to remove the Draenor Pathfinder requirement for flying in Draenor, I just wanted to add that there&apos;s a lot of great feedback on both sides of the fence here, thanks everyone for remaining mostly constructive.

PvP Like a Pro - Practicing Effectively<br>
<br>
Two weeks ago, we kicked off the PvP like a Pro series, where we talk to some of the best Arena players in the world and gain their insights. <br>
<br>
Part 3 - Practicing Effectively<br>
<br>
Minpojke of team Northern Gaming Blue has achieved rank one in Arena every season since 2011. His current squad has been playing together for more than two years, and came third in the Global Finals at BlizzCon 2016. With his help, we&#x2019;ve built a five-step guide to help you practice like a pro!<br>
<br>
Synergy - Align Your Team<br>
Before setting out on your quest to the top, make sure you&#x2019;re &#x201C;aligned as a team,&#x201D; says Minpojke. Like in any group activity, &#x201C;it&#x2019;s very important that everyone has the same goals and the same drive to do what it takes to win.&#x201D; Make sure your team shares similar ambitions, and is aligned on how much effort will be required to achieve them. And of course, make sure you have similar gaming schedules so you can play and practice together!<br>
<br>
Atmosphere - Stay Positive<br>
It&#x2019;s important to have a good atmosphere while playing. Minpojke says, &#x201C;If you and your group get along and even become friends, you&#x2019;ll like playing and actually learn more as well.&#x201D; Be sure that the mood stays positive so that you can enjoy competing and improving together. It&#x2019;s much easier to keep a team motivated if you&#x2019;re all having fun&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a game after all!<br>
<br>
Stated more simply, Minpojke says, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s easy to win as a team&#x2014;in the sense that it&#x2019;s easy to be happy and celebrate&#x2014;but if you&#x2019;re capable of losing together, then you&#x2019;ll be a great team.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Strategy - Know the Meta<br>
When it comes to making practice effective, Minpojke feels it&#x2019;s a priority to stay up to date with the current meta. He told us that the best way to do this is to follow tournaments, high-level Arena streams, and the PvP Leaderboards to see which classes are on top.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s quite easy to keep up with the meta. Watch streams to see what the pros are playing, and track the ladder to see which classes and compositions are at the top. And don&#x2019;t forget to follow tournaments to see the best comps shine.&#x201D; Once you&#x2019;re confident in what you want to play, it&#x2019;s time to queue up! As FabsS discussed in our previous interview, Minpojke says that it&#x2019;s important to set your win condition before the gates open. &#x201C;Ask what you want to achieve as a team; will you focus on a lot of CC or try to draw out the game longer?&#x201D; Since you know what matchup you&#x2019;ll be playing against, you can start to ask these questions and develop your strategy.<br>
<br>
Analysis - Review Your Games<br>
If your setup supports it, Minpojke recommends recording as many sessions as you can&#x2014;they&#x2019;re much more valuable then looking at a damage meter. He says that the first objective is to see if you followed your game plan. Did you stick to it? Did it work? If the answer to either of these questions is no, you need to work on executing the plan better in future or possibly changing it up all together.<br>
<br>
Watching your own recordings is also a chance to highlight individual mistakes. As Minpojke says, &#x201C;Always stay self-critical, and always look for ways to improve&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll notice pretty quickly your most crucial and common mistakes.&#x201D; While Minpojke emphasizes that &#x201C;losing is arguably the best way of learning,&#x201D; he also reminded us that &#x201C;it&#x2019;s very important to recognize when you do well.&#x201D; Think positively here: no one can play the perfect game, but there are often good takeaways to be emulated going forward.<br>
<br>
Reviewing recordings of his gameplay is a regular part of Minpojke&#x2019;s routine, as well as discussing previous matches with his team between games while queueing. You can learn from a win as well as a loss!<br>
<br>
Execute - Implement Your Analysis<br>
After watching the replays, it&#x2019;s time to set your goals. Decide what you want to focus on, and &#x201C;make plans before you queue for a session.&#x201D; If there was a specific matchup you were struggling with, you can discuss plans for how you&#x2019;ll react to it next time.<br>
<br>
In some instances, it could be worth writing some notes, especially if you have many things to focus on versus many compositions. Minpojke equated it to studying for a test, &#x201C;Practice it, and read it over and over until it sticks in your head.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Minpojke attended his first BlizzCon with current teammate Zunniyaki in 2013, finishing in second place. Northern Gaming Blue are the defending European Champions, and with nine BlizzCon appearances between their players, they&#x2019;re one of the most experienced rosters in the field.<br>
<br>
