A Found Memento: Raising a King<br>
For those of the Alliance, the loss of King Varian Wrynn at the Broken Shore continues to echo throughout Azeroth. But for his son, Anduin Wrynn, that loss is felt most keenly as he faces not only the loss of a father, but takes on new responsibilities as a king. <br>
<br>
Whether Horde or Alliance, we didn&#x2019;t want you to miss seeing the culmination of the Alliance-only quest line A Found Memento and witnessing the rise of the new King of Stormwind.<br>

In-game Cinematic Team Insights:<br>
This was a story we had been wanting to share for a while, but hadn&#x2019;t yet arrived at the right moment in the expansion to tell it. When things fell apart at the Broken Shore, it felt like there were many things left unsaid and unfinished for Anduin&#x2014;and for the community as well. We went from the death of a king during the horrific clash at the Broken Shore, right into a battle for Azeroth&#x2019;s very survival against the Burning Legion. There was no time to grieve for Anduin. However, with our return to the Broken Shore in Patch 7.2, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to revisit the young Wrynn&#x2019;s storyline, and reveal to the audience that he&#x2019;s still struggling to find his place as a king and coming to terms with the death of his father. <br>
<br>
Knowing the story we wanted to tell in this cinematic, the quest team took the initiative to craft a robust quest line leading up to it, building and amplifying the emotional context for the cutscene. For those who have had the opportunity to play through it, there&#x2019;s significant impact as we gain insight into what Anduin is experiencing&#x2014;you see the people of Stormwind sharing their unvarnished feelings and doubts about Anduin as their new king. You witness some of the same skepticism conveyed by Genn Greymane&#x2014;who, in his own gruff way, has stepped in as a father figure to the young king&#x2014;and Velen, who has been his friend and mentor in the way of the Light on his journey to priesthood. Hearing these doubts led Anduin to make a firm decision: &#x201C;I must see the Broken Shore for myself.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The rest of the tale is told within the cinematic. Everyone who worked on it is incredibly thankful that, after all that has happened, we had the opportunity to say &#x201C;goodbye&#x201D; to King Varian Wrynn, and reveal a glimpse of what lies ahead for King Anduin Wrynn.<br>

Genn Greymane &#x2013; King of Gilneas<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A monster lurks in my veins&#x2026; Threaten my people, and it will be the last thing you ever see.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
After spending many years of isolation and abjectly refusing to rejoin the Alliance, Genn Greymane and his nation suffered a horrifying curse, transforming some Gilneans&#x2014;including Greymane&#x2013;into bloodthirsty wolf-beasts known as worgen. Their long seclusion behind their wall ended when Sylvanas and her Forsaken invaded the weakened kingdom and wreaked great destruction upon them. Gilneas suffered great losses&#x2014;including the death of Genn&#x2019;s own son, Liam. Rather than crumble, Greymane has focused his efforts on securing peace for the Alliance intent on one day reclaiming his lost kingdom.

Serenity Stops Raiding, Players Join Method<br>
Several players from Serenity have left the guild to join Method (https://www.method.gg/serenity-main-raiders-return-to-method), causing Serenity to discontinue raiding (http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1spsir2). <br>
As many of you have been aware, this tuesday evening we all suffered some sad turn of events.<br>
<br>
I&apos;ll try to keep this post as short and on-topic as possible, but I feel like I owe it to all of the fans (and haters) that I and my guild Serenity have had in the past couple of years.<br>
<br>
When we disbanded from Method in the beginning it was to make a raiding environment of people that shared the same interest in the game and that had the same desire to be the best. At first (during HFC farm) we accomplished that. We had a group of 25 players who all had numerous WF&apos;s on the record and we were looking strong as hell going into Legion.<br>
<br>
As things progressed during the endless HFC farm that it was, people started quitting. We lost 3 noteably worthy players in Berrek, Sonie, and later on Zaelia, which was a huge blow for us. All 3 due to IRL commitments, which is only natural.<br>
<br>
We kept going on as a guild trying to find the right players, but it was hard and it took a lot of effort on all of us. The stability of a core roster (especially your healers) is just the key to every top guilds&apos; success.<br>
<br>
Anyways. Enough about our roster issues over the years. Haters are gonna say its our own fault because we have a hostile environment or whatever lame-ass-hating comment you might have, and i&apos;m glad you feel that way, because it means we were doing something right :-)<br>
<br>
Now, personally. I wanna thank all of the 50+ players we&apos;ve had in Serenity since we formed it, I wanna thank all of the fans, the friends, the viewers, the followers on social media and our sponsors we&apos;ve had, I hope you all will still follow the race, follow MY friends that I&apos;ve played with for the past 2 years and I hope you&apos;ll keep being awesome, because for a guy whos competing for a world first, theres nothing sweeter than when you get a cheer on the back from you guys following the wow PvE scene.<br>
<br>
I know as i&apos;m writing this post and as you guys might feel on my tone this is the end of my online &quot;career&quot;. I will officially retire from the game with a heavy heart as the goal we set out to reach never got reached (the world first), however I have so many good memories that I will cherish forever.<br>
<br>
To end it off with, thank you to Method for the motivation you&apos;ve brought since we split up, and thank you for our times back in the day before we ditched. Props to you Sco for building the brand you&apos;ve always talked about - I&apos;ve been in it and I wanna give a massive kudos of respect to you for not burning out.<br>
<br>
And lastly but not least I wanna give a shoutout to the friends that I met through this WoW process, particularly Leeds, Rogerbrown (all hates about your poaching aside), Pottm, Fragnance, Mike, Ted, Bodari, Ashvael, and Zeuzonita of course.<br>
