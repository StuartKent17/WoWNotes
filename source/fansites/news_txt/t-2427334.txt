Demonology

Diabolic Raiment 2-piece set bonus chance to activate reduced to 4% was 20%.




Items

Khor, Hammer of the Guardian https://www.wowdb.com/items/163119-khor-hammer-of-the-guardian?bonusIDs=1477,4798 is now item level 120 to signify that it is a Transmog weapon.


Island Expeditions

Seafarer's Dubloon https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1710-seafarers-dubloon items may no longer be used in PvP Island Expeditions.

Developers’ notes: We're looking for ways to use Dubloons in the future, but for the time being, we do not feel that Dubloon use makes for a good experience in a PvP setting.

Demolishers and Siege Tanks have been tuned to do less damage, with longer cooldowns on several of their abilities.


Missions

Stealth missions now only have two bosses or objectives to counter.


Player versus Player

Relentless PvP Talent and Hardiness Orc Racial no longer stack their Stun duration reduction effects.
Fixed a bug that was preventing the weekly Conquest turn-in quests from being pushed to some players.
Bonus Rolls for Rated Arena and Rated Battleground matches will now be removed when leaving the instance.


Professions

Engineering

The F.R.I.E.D., Organic Discombobulation Grenade https://www.wowdb.com/items/153487-organic-discombobulation-grenade, and Thermo-Accelerated Plague Spreader https://www.wowdb.com/items/153494-thermo-accelerated-plague-spreader all now require fewer materials to craft. Rank 3 versions of their recipes should now also require fewer materials than Rank 2.

Inscription

Glyph of the Headhunter has been removed, as it is no longer a viable glyph.



Quests

Fixed a display issue when interacting with the Injured Zandalari Soldiers on “The Road of Pain”.
