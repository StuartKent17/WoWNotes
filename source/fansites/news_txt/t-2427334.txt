Items

Khor, Hammer of the Guardian ,4798 is now item level 120 to signify that it is a Transmog weapon.


Island Expeditions

Seafarer's Dubloon  items may no longer be used in PvP Island Expeditions.

Developers’ notes: We're looking for ways to use Dubloons in the future, but for the time being, we do not feel that Dubloon use makes for a good experience in a PvP setting.

Demolishers and Siege Tanks have been tuned to do less damage, with longer cooldowns on several of their abilities.


Missions

Stealth missions now only have two bosses or objectives to counter.


Player versus Player

Relentless PvP Talent and Hardiness Orc Racial no longer stack their Stun duration reduction effects.
