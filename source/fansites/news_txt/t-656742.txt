The Season 7 Models were also updated in the latest PTR builds and it's time for an update. Keep in mind that this is from the test servers, some models aren't finished yet. Mage shoulders are bugged, the color of the hunter's helm seems to be the old one, the female priest breastplate seems bugged, etc ...
