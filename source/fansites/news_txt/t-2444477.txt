Here are some things to remember when submitting a question:


It's important to keep your question brief and to the point so that we can get to as many as we can.
If you see a question in this thread you would like an answer to, please feel free to "Like" or upvote it.
We anticipate there will be a lot of questions. With so many, we won't be able to ask them all, but we'll do the best we can.
Please make sure you're asking a question versus making a statement.


Thank you!
