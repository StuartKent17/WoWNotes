Addon Review: World Boss Status
Now that you have had time to level alts, you may have trouble remembering which alts have done which world bosses each week. World Boss Status http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/world-boss-status is a very simple addon that will save kills per character for you. It can output the information to chat, a minimap button tooltip, or utilize one of the LibDataBroker displays, such as ChocolateBar http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/chocolatebar or Bazooka http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/bazooka. 

It is a very simple addon, but will be even more handy with the new World Bosses being added in Patch 5.2. You can grab it from Curse http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/world-boss-status or directly through the Curse Client curse://www.curse.com/addons/wow/world-boss-status/download-client.

Content Difficulty Feedback
the comparison made the console games - i completely agree. this is an MMORPG. why should it require 3 seperate difficulty levels? this is NOT a console game, it should not be adjustable to suit any 1 persons play style on principle of the genre. dont even try to twist this point. MMORPG's are Mass Multiplayer, more than a few peoples ideas are required to completely overhaul a part of the system such as raids. you even created LFR to solve this problem. just because they want to select a higher difficulty does NOT mean it should be made easier. i don't go on to call of duty and select Veteran difficulty as a noob and expect it to be easy, and anyone who does is NOT worth affecting the play styles of others.
World of Warcraft is neither the first MMO to have varying levels of difficulty, nor the only one. You can't compare it to a completely different game Call of Duty as it doesn't even share the same genre nor the same design philosophies or game design.

If you look at the MMO world you'll see other titles do also adjust the difficulty of their content, in fact, there's a very popular case of such a boss in another MMO, which I won't name here for obvious reasons.

You killing normal Elegon doesn't effect my HC Elegon. When you come and ask MY elegon to be nerfed, then it affects my game. Otherwise i wouldn't care less what they do with 'your' Elegon as long as I can try and kill 'my' Elegon or wipe on 'my elegon' till i learn to move from the floor in time
It's not "your" heroic Elegon though neither "their" normal Elegon. But there's something that has been said on this thread that is true. As much as some hardcore players love to blame the casuals when 'their' content has been nerfed in the past, the fact is, you'll rarely see threads asking for heroic bosses to be nerfed. Sure, you'll find the occasional thread here and there, but it's far from common. 

Let me make it clearer by an example: We were slowly but surely progressing on spine of deathwing when the nerfs started rolling in. Beat spine when it was nerfed by 10%, and Madness when it was nerfed 15%. This made us feel cheated. We did not feel that we had succeeded in killing those bosses the way they were meant to be killed, it even borderlined on a feeling of shame, as there was another top guild on the server that beat both at 0% 3 weeks earlier.
3 weeks earlier? Did they turn the debuff off? Because in fact, it took 3 months for the debuff to go from 0% to 15%:
http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3599256 5%, January 31
http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3746119 10%, February 28
http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3899863 15%, March 26

But still, it's a fair point that your accomplishment felt diminished because of a debuff tackled on the boss. That's the reason why in Mists of Pandaria there're the "Cutting Edge" achievements for the three final Heroic bosses of the current tier in fact, on the Patch 5.2 PTR they currently read "defeated before the discovery of Throne of Thunder, so although this isn't Dragon Soul and there're no nerfs in place, you have a good reason to actually try to chase those kills and earn a reward that will, no doubt, be rare among raiders come 5.2. You'll be able to show that Feat of Strength and say "I killed it before 5.2". 

Also, we didn't have the Item Upgrade system that is available right now although it'll be going away with the arrival of 5.2, at least temporarily, so the panorama you're looking at right now is vastly different than that of Dragon Soul, even if it feels like not that much has happened since then.

Why does Blizzard hate options so much? Talents, Upgrades, many stats went away. Do you think players are stupid?
On the contrary, players are so smart that they "solved" the simplistic talent design too quickly and never looked at it again. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/290190460335583232
So the new talent system ISN'T that good after all? What are you gonna do, then? Change it all over again in 6.0?
I didn't mean to imply the new model isn't good. We're happy with it overall, just changing some that aren't used enough. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/290931983666798593

blood 476i solo 2 rogues 500/485i + mage 485i. comf w/ this? tank damage is ridic, dps in raids is overboard, esp blood.
Tank damage shouldn't be ridiculous when fighting rogues, because they lack Vengeance. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/290931646486704129

Hey GC, for how long are Arcane and Affliction going to remain 8-10% above all other classes/specs on bosses overall?
Probably until 5.2. We think they are both overpowered, but not so bad that hotfixes are critical. We'll keep an eye on it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/290188907180613632

.…based on damage alone, is there any other path to achieve that goal?
Very progression-oriented guilds appreciate the non-DPS aspects of each spec. Other players just focus on the stack rank of DPS. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/290188684437884928

GC, why do we have confusing abilities like Rapid Fire which don't trigger GCD, yet still can't be used during a GCD?
Abilities off the GCD tend to get macro'd unless they are very situational. Macros shouldn't make decisions for you. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/290180215886454784

I'd rather a glyph be effective and boring than interesting but rarely used.

*more* class distinction, yet the trend has been to homogenize classe? This sounds like an opinion rather than a direction.
No, actually a direction, but at the same time we have to keep players happy and when their character don't work, they aren't. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/291285660738924544

Any plans on fixing the Vanish bugs atm? I seem to be getting pulled out of stealth quite often after vanishing.
We haven't heard many complaints about Vanish not working since we totally rebuilt it a year or two ago. Any more details? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/291256235750207488
You could vanish a cheapshot or deathcoil, you can still do it, but you're CC'ed IN vanish which is extremely lame.
It was also really buggy BC of server lag and spells already in flight. "Fix Vanish" was probably the number one request we got. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/291257404350423040

Does WoW have too many buttons? What's the long-term thinking since you like to add new abilities every expac? Hard to keybind
Totally agree. On the other hand, leveling up and not getting new spells is pretty lame too. We don't have a great solution yet. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/291250601000587264

the spell power of ret pally does not benefit from SP 10% buff, is this a bug?
Not a bug. Their attack power is increased, which gives them spell power indirectly. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/290933771723755520

Hungering Cold was scapped because you thought it was a stun, while ironically giving a stun to dks and that move to paladins.

chakra cooldown needs to be removed. is there a reason to keep a 30-second cd ? it's not a choice, it's a pain.
With no cooldown, you aren't making any choices about your healing focus. You're just changing it whenever it suits you. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/290929691085377536

nerfing Disc would create 2 underpowered specs. Wouldn't it make more sense for both to meet eachother halfway?
Holy competes fine with the other healers. Disc is just so powerful that unless you're stubborn, you probably go Disc. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/290918303147372544

You sir are an idiot. Nerf a good spec to make a shitty one seem ok.... really.......Holy has way bigger issues.
That's not how we see it. Holy posts bad numbers because there are 5-10X as many priests playing Disc and beating other healers Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/291294977743519745
Then where are all priests ? playing as a shadow ? Or you want more disc in PvP ? and more holy in PvE ?
Disc is overpowered in PvE and underpowered in PvP. We're trying to solve both. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/291297381096497153
Doesn't Disc tend to post better numbers than direct healing just because absorbs go before direct heals?
Yes. But that still means Disc is doing more for the group than the healers who are getting their heals sniped. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/291321933360939008

Warrior Question: Do you feel that both Arms and Fury both versions will be enhanced in the upcoming patch 5.2 in PVE?
Depends on what you mean by "enhanced." Fury doesn't need any more DPS in PvE. Arms might need a little. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/290936320707158019

if you want to balance SW without changing the % heal per sec, why don't you just change when SW starts, like below 20% or 25%
In PvP, you might spend only seconds at that percent. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/290931440068202497

The new haste bonus for Warriors, does it double Haste just from gear or all buffs? Heroism/Potions/Raid Gimmicks.

It's already at what 220% on PTR? But we agree more Slams makes the Arms rotation even in PvP more interesting. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/290181139065356288

then why are you testing the next raid at an heroic ilvl? A tiny minority of casuals will have 502 at tier's end.

also, are you planning for the 5.0 raids to still give out VP in 5.2? It could hurt a lot if not, specially small guilds.
Yeah, at the moment we are. It might be less than today, but they seem like a good valor option. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/290189874047377408

And durability, and travel, and maybe flasks and... wait, where did the game go? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/290919622482481154

wait are you saying if a majority of people don’t like something?
I'm saying most players aren't in a position to conduct a scientific poll. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288021673976950784

I´m curious if the changes you make are based on more feedback than 200 players. If you ever publish any feedback that is...
Totally depends on the change. Some based on the habits of millions of players. Others because of 1 insightful post. It's not a vote Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289832694278406145

With all due respect, if you disagree with simcraft, then show us your internal one, afraid that we will find mistakes?
We are the designers. If you disagree with our design, the burden of proof is on your to convince us we're wrong. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289823992351711232
we are the financiers the burden is on you to keep us happy and paying. prove US wrong. =D =P
Agree that it's our job to keep you happy. Disagree that proving sims right or wrong is the most effective way to do that. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289831882282106880

Where do you base your ideas of balance on? The general vibe or actual representation numbers?
For things like DPS, the real numbers. You can't test how effective a CC chain is in PvP though. We rely more on feedback then. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289108154451648513
And even in the case of DPS, we will make changes if players can't hit the expected numbers or use different rotations etc. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289108352661848064

To be specific, Do you care if a player is happy with the game as long as they keep playing?
Yes, in life you also have to pay bills. But why spend your short years on Earth making a game that players just tolerate? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288706153217675264
Most devs I know are in this business because they want to make games people like. It's a passion, not a means to a quick buck. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288706024834215936

What do you mean with "sampling bias."?
Players sometimes view logs as how much DPS everyone *can* do. That's not what logs measure. That's the bias. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288494126985510914
Say X is 2% higher DPS than Y. All the best skilled and geared players go X, further inflating X to maybe 10% higher than Y. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288493644787351552

I left because some high rated arena players told me i didn't had what it takes, brought down my motivation.
Unfortunately, one of our community's favorite things to do is tell others that they're doing it wrong. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288490810905882624

So basically you guys were full of shit when you promised aerial combat in WG on the WOTLK original box?
Our philosophy is to try not to ship bad designs just so we can say we shipped them. Players get angry, but angrier if it's bad. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288490249825447937

from the sounds of it, you're already contemplating quitting twitter.what are you going to do if twitter doesn't work out?
Reddit? Pintrest? Not giving up yet. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288487992836890624

How many people is considered a lot at that point?
It only takes a single person to make a compelling point to have us consider it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288418942815436801

Why do people so rude to you when they talk about game balance?
Not sure. Maybe they feel they have to be loud to get attention or else they're just frustrated and can't help themselves. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288406693585510400

the most important thing you guys learned from Cata going into Mists?
Don't let players quickly run out of things to do! Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288080830063063040

You say WoW isn't good as single player game but many quests suck/are frustrating in groups or w/others around. Thoughts?
It's a fair criticism. Seeing / playing with other players of your faction should generally be a bonus not a penalty. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/290922427066769408

Please don't ignore our valid concerns because of one player's attitude. Please read some of our suggestions.
I wouldn't punish a class because of a few bad apples. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289909449475387393
plumbers don't refuse to fix x problem because basement too cluttered/gunky. Maybe wade into class forums once in a blue moon?
Good plumbers don't cause more leaks though. Even the simple PTR thread I started brought several "I feel ignored" posts. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/290186461356122113

I don't see there being much maintenance required for a vanilla server. You guys would get a ton of old players back for sure.
It would be a ridiculous amount of maintenance. Nearly every patch fix would have to be made twice. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/291291334688505857
