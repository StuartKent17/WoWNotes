Patch 5.4 - Ghostcrawler Interview
Ghostcrawler was in Asia last week and QQ was able to sit down with him for an interview http://games.qq.com/a/20130725/003240.htm. Keep in mind that things are often lost in translation or mistranslated! Thanks to ngacnlcq http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/565579-ngacnlcq for the translation http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1326134-Ghostcrawler-Interview?p=21919749#post21919749.


The item level squish http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2541-The-Great-Item-Squish-%28or-Not%29-of-Pandaria might will? take place next expansion.
There is still no timeline for the DotA battleground release.
The Hearthstone board http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/july/Hearthstone_Gameboard.jpg that was added in a PTR build is just for decoration and there is no plan to add Hearthstone to WoW.
The Lesser Charms that may be added to the Asian store are there as a convenience item for players that may not have time to do their daily quests that week or players who just want to save time. There are no plans to add items to the store that will increase player stats.
Patch 5.4 is the last content raid? patch, but there will be bugfix and balance patches after it, as well as a pre-expansion patch.
If a fourth class role was ever implemented, it might provide buffs or support, but it would be a big change https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340960365020078080 to the game and is very unlikely to happen https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361996829426057216.



Patch 5.4 - Timeless Isle Armor
The Timeless Isle will allow players to obtain item level 496 and 535 gear through drops found around the island. 

The items used to create the 496 armor are found all over the island in chests and dropped by mobs, similar to the items used to create armor in Battlefield: Barrens. The Burden of Eternity http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/103982-burden-of-eternity is a rare drop from mobs, found in the Blazing Chest http://ptr.wowdb.com/objects/221673-blazing-chest, or in one of Kukuru's chests ptr.wowdb.com/items/101538-kukurus-cache-key#related:opens_!.

The item level 535 version of the gear is called "Timeless" and is obtained by using a Burden of Eternity http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/103982-burden-of-eternity on an item that creates armor, such as a Timeless Leather Helm http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/102280-timeless-leather-helm.

Patch 5.4 normal difficulty gear has an item level of 553, while flex gear is 540, and raid finder gear is 528. This makes the 535 Timeless gear a nice upgrade for players that will only raid in Raid Finder difficulty and a temporary upgrade for players who will be raiding Flex difficulty. It is also an upgrade for players who are currently raiding Throne of Thunder Normal, as well as any Heroic raiders still missing a slot.

Past Legendary Items for Patch 5.4
The legendary meta gem will still function, but Sha-touched gems and sockets will not be applicable to new 5.4 items.

No extra sockets in 5.4? Then why the hell did you update the 5.2 weapons from ToT to be able to use them? This is incredibly stupid and seems like a total oversight. 1750g for a new weapon socket is SO not that expensive. 
We updated the 5.2 weapons to allow the additional socket but not the Sha-touched gems because a very large number of players were getting their extra sockets just in time for the patch to drop and thus, would only be able to use their reward for a week or two. That's not the case with 5.4. The 5.2 legendary meta gem will continue to function, and the 5.3 epic cloak will upgrade into the 5.4 legendary.

We feel that, at this point, the Sha-Touched gem and socket have had plenty of time to be useful and it's time for them to go. As Lothrik mentioned, we'll be balancing content assuming that they're not present anyway. That said, nothing on the PTR is final, and we are still open to discussion on the topic.

Proving Grounds Feedback
Just a quick note that we're still doing a lot of tuning for Proving Grounds, and your feedback has been and continues to be invaluable. There will be a bunch more bug fixes and tweaks in the next build for testing.

In particular, the next build has a lot of work done on the AI for the friendly party members in the Healer trials. Once it hits the PTR, we'd really appreciate any feedback on how they're acting, especially specific examples of things they do that seem "dumb." I don't have an exact timeframe on when that build will go up, but it should be within the next few days UPDATE: should be today!

RPPMScaling with Rune Regeneration Mechanics
After some investigation, we found that rune regeneration mechanics were, indeed, giving an unintended increase to RPPM proc rates. Unholy in particular gains a significant performance boost from this bug. We're going to fix the bug, but we'll also be compensating Unholy.

In the next build, Unholy Presence will give pure haste, rather than just attack speed. This will allow it to legitimately increase proc rates for RPPM mechanics. Runic Corruption and Improved Blood Presence, however, will no longer have an effect on RPPM proc rates.
