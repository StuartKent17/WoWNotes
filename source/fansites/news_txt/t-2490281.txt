chaud2019-06-05, 04:14 PMBattle of Dazar'alor Raid Achievements and Off-Season Details
The launch of Rise of Azshara will mark the end of Battle for Azeroth Season 2. On launch day date to-be-announced soon, both PvP and Mythic Keystone competition will close, and a two-week off-season for those activities will begin.

During the off-season, Mythic Keystone dungeons will still be playable using Season 2 affixes and rewards, but their seasonal achievements will no longer be available. Additionally, it will still be possible to queue for Rated PvP and earn based on your Season 2 rating, but seasonal rewards and titles will no longer be earnable. The end-of-season rankings will close when Rise of Azshara goes live.

As always, we ask that competitive players refrain from transferring characters to another realm or faction until after BFA Season 3 has begun.

BFA Season 3 will begin two weeks after the content update, along with the opening of Azshara’s Eternal Palace, the new Operation: Mechagon dungeon, a new seasonal affix for Mythic Keystone dungeons, and the availability of higher item-level Azerite gear.

Additionally, Battle of Dazar’alor and Crucible of the Storm raid achievements such as Ahead of the Curve and Cutting Edge will be obtainable throughout the off-season. You can continue to earn both of them right up until Azshara’s Eternal Palace opens.

Now get out there and fight to the finish!
