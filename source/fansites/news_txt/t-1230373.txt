Wrathion Quest Lines
The last thing we heard http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31483-incoming from Wrathion were his instructions to await the fleet's arrival in Patch 5.1. After meeting the scout http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32249-meet-the-scout, and clearing the way http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32250-the-might-of-the-warchief, the fleet will arrive http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32108-domination-point. 

You can then visit Wrathion again, who wants to learn more about Varian http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32373-the-measure-of-a-leader. You must then prove that your faction should win the war http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32374-the-princes-pursuit by earning Revered with him, which is done by killing forces of the opposing faction in Krasarang Wilds. There are some side quests along the way, such as winning the new Mists of Pandaria battlegrounds http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32389-the-lion-roars or taking a group to kill a general http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32388-a-change-of-command.

After you are revered, Wrathion will call you back http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32390-call-of-the-packmaster to tell you what he has learned about Varian. This is seemingly where the quest line stops for now. It may be incomplete, as the Horde side of the quest line is not even added yet. 

That isn't all Wrathion is doing in this patch however. Warlocks get a class quest from Sealed Tome of the Lost Legion http://www.wowdb.com/items/92426. After binding it to you http://www.wowdb.com/spells/133806-unlock-tome and consulting with one of your demons http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32295-an-unusual-tome, you can take it to a Warlock trainer http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32307-reader-for-the-dead-tongue to find out more about it.

You then visit Wrathion, who asks you http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32309-a-tale-of-six-masters to read Legacy of the Masters Part 1 http://www.wowdb.com/items/83078-legacy-of-the-masters-part-1#c1;related:comments. You are then sent to General Nazgrim http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32311-enlistment-orders / Admiral Taylor http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32312-enlistment-orders to let him know that you are going to try and recruit The Council of the Black Harvest http://www.wowpedia.org/Council_of_the_Black_Harvest to aid in the fight against the Alliance / Horde. 

Next, you infiltrate http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32313-hunt-helheim the opposite faction's base to obtain the second part of Legacy of the Masters. You retrieve Jubeka's Journal http://www.wowdb.com/items/92471 from them, which has clues as to the location of four Soulstone fragments http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32317-seeking-the-soulstones that contain memories. Once you have collected them all, you combine them and follow the source http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32324-seek-the-signal of the power to the Black Temple. 

You then follow Kanrethad and Jubeka's trail http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32325-infiltrating-the-black-temple to the top of the Black Temple. While on your way there, Akama will make another appearance in the area where you fought Bloodboil. He is under attack by forces you unleashed in the Reliquary of Souls, so you assist him http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32341-demonstrate-your-power and then make your way http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32340-plunder-the-black-temple to the summit. 

Once there, something happens that creates The Eye of the Storm http://www.wowdb.com/items/92563-the-eye-of-the-storm. You then return to Wrathion http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32359-the-eye-of-the-naaru to try and find out what it is. He doesn't know anything about it, but is willing to ask his agents. They are busy with the Horde and Alliance war, so you will have to wait until Patch 5.2 http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32360-awaiting-the-black-harvest to find out what happens next!

Brawler's Guild Preview
Patch 5.1 adds a new activity, the Brawler's Guild. It is located in an instanced area in Stormwind or Orgrimmar. Upon entering the area you can see the arena where the current fight is taking place if there is one, along with any other spectators, the Brawler's Guild NPCs to queue from, and the Quartermaster. 

Only one player can fight at a time, so you must queue for battle with one of the NPCs. When it is your turn, you enter the ring and fight a somewhat difficult mob. Each win gives you reputation to raise your ranking. There are a total of eight ranks to progress through, with many wins needed to go up through each rank. 

Each time you win a fight, you are rewarded with a Brawler's Purse http://www.wowdb.com/items/92718-brawlers-purse or Bulging Brawler's Purse http://www.wowdb.com/items/92719-bulging-brawlers-purse, which contains some gold and vendor trash, depending on your ranking and luck.

Official Notes
You can find our raw unofficial class spell changes here http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1230462-Patch-5-1-Unofficial-Spell-Changes?p=19230084#post19230084.
General

The Pandaren Campaign begins!

The conflict between the Horde and the Alliance has ignited a new series of daily quests along the shore of the Krasarang Wilds.
Players can visit their faction strongholds in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms to begin the quest to summon their war fleets to the continent of Pandaria. 
Players will both valiantly defend their faction’s outpost and assault the opposing faction's headquarters.
Two new Reputations have been added: Alliance players can earn reputation with Operation: Shieldwall, while Horde players will curry favor with the Dominance Offensive.
Players can follow the story of the Pandaren Campaign through a series of special quests tied to their reputation with the landing forces. Heroes assisting with the war effort will join key characters and faction leaders as the growing conflagration spreads across Pandaria... as well as other locations around Azeroth.
Players can slay rival NPCs and opposing faction players along the shore to earn commissions that can be spent to upgrade their faction's base.
Look for strategic objectives to capture, including graveyards and towers. Commissions can be spent to recruit guards that will help protect this captured territory!
Players who are truly dedicated to their faction can spend their commissions on an item that will give their fellows an extra reputation group quest for the day. Horde players can speak with Ongrom Black Tooth, while Alliance players can contact Proveditor Grantley for details.


Item Level Upgrades

Players can now use PvE and PvP currencies to directly upgrade equipment by visiting Ethereal merchants in their respective Pandaria faction capitals.
Weapons and armor of item level 458 or higher can be improved by up to 8 item levels each.
Rare quality PvE gear costs 1500 Justice Points to upgrade once for 8 item levels, while Epic quality PvE gear costs 750 Valor Points for 4 item levels and can be upgraded twice.
Rare quality PvP gear costs 1500 Honor Points to upgrade once for 8 item levels, while Epic quality PvP gear costs 750 Conquest Points for 4 item levels and can be upgraded twice.
Be aware that items that have received item level enhancements cannot be placed into Void Storage.


Legendary Quest

Wrathion has taken a keen interest in the events along the coast of the Krasarang Wilds. Those that have aided the Black Prince in the past will now have new quests to complete as they advance Wrathion’s agenda for Pandaria and their own progress toward Legendary power.


Brawler's Guild

Underground fighting rings have sprung up in Stormwind and Orgrimmar that will give brawlers who have their mitts on an invitation a chance to earn bragging rights by testing their solo PvE mettle against some of the toughest creatures found in World of Warcraft.
Players will prove their skill, and increase their rank with the Brawler's Guild, as they win matches against some of the most difficult solo encounters in World of Warcraft.
Entry into the brawler’s guild is by invitation only. Invitations can be found on the black market auction house, by invitation from somebody within the guild, and occasionally as drops from certain Horde and Alliance NPCs.
As their Brawler's Guild rank increases, players will unlock additional rewards and activities within the Brawler’s Guild.
Brawlers on a realm will gather together into the blood spattered ring to watch as their peers face down their own opponents. They can watch the battles in progress to learn from hardened Brawler's Guild veterans as they wait for their own turn to fight.
If this is your first night at Brawler's Guild, you have to fight.



Lesser Charms of Good Fortune no longer take up bag space, and are now recorded in the currency tab of the Character Sheet.
Grand Commendations are now available for purchase from all Mists of Pandaria faction vendors at Revered reputation. Using a Grand Commendation will permanently increase the amount of reputation gained with that faction across all characters on a Battle.net account.

Players will have a very small chance to obtain a general purpose and family specific Flawless Battle-stone after winning a match against wild pets; defeating higher level opponents increases the chances of obtaining a stone.

WoWDB Addon Data Collection
You may have noticed that we are making slow and steady progress on WoWDB http://www.wowdb.com/, but now we need some help from you! If you are using Curse Client http://www.curse.com/client, you can contribute data like mining node locations http://www.wowdb.com/objects/209311-ghost-iron-deposit and what a vendor sells http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/64054-krogo-darkhide. 

Help out by checking the box in the Curse Client options as seen below. When you are playing the addon will gather data and save it. When you are done playing, Curse Client will see the game close and upload the collected data from the addon.
