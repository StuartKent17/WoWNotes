Winter Veil Gifts<br>
Just wanted to confirm there was indeed an issue affecting the Gently Shaken Gift, it not being available right away for characters that looted it last year.<br>
<br>
This however has now been hotfixed and everyone should be able to get their 6th gift, the Hearthstation, without having to resort to any workaround (Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17617662554?page=2#34))<br>
