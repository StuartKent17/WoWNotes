Pet Battle Spectating
Yea, who needs arena spectating when you've got this 
The pet battle spectating is not really "spectating" as such. You do not get to watch players versus other players, you only get to see them when they are fighting a wild pets. Before this change all you would see when a player was battling wild pets was them just standing there idly, now the battle will be visible to outside parties and not just to the player battling the wild pets. This means that the "pet battle spectating" is not really a new system for watching pet battles that had to be developed, it was simply a change to make wild pet battles visible to outside observers. 

The same cannot be said for an arena spectating mode though. In order for us to create a system for arena spectating we would need to build a system from the ground up. While the ability to spectate arena matches is something that we would definitely love to implement into World of Warcraft, at this current point we have no plans for it.

Its coded message to PvP community "We dont give a fck about PvP or you, pokemon is all that matters" 
That's as far from the truth as it gets, there is loads of new content and changes on its way for PvP in patch 5.3;
Balance adjustments/changes New Arena New Battleground Conquest point catch-up system PvP gear changes PvP stat changes Battle fatigue changes And more...

If we did not care for the state or well-being of PvP in World of Warcraft we would say so, however the reality is that we do care for PvP and we are constantly making changes and additions in order to improve it.
