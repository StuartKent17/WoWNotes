Patch 8.0.1 Hotfixes - September 14th
Island Expeditions

Substantially increased the drop rates for the various bonus rewards, such as transmog items, pets, quest starters, and mounts.


Player versus Player

Starting next week, earning 500 Conquest in a week, regardless of the status of your weekly Rated PvP quest, will also make you eligible for a weekly PvP reward chest. It is strongly recommended that you complete a Rated PvP quest this week to ensure your eligibility for the next chest.
Weekly Conquest rewards now display the correct item level inside PvP instances.
All ranks of Battleborn Sigil and Warlord's Trophy should now function as intended and are usable on any Dread Gladiator's item of lower item level.
Fixed a bug that made it possible to receive a lower item-level item than intended from PvP bonus rolls.

ground or flying mount?
Kua'fon. i finished his quest line and got the achievement. but as it turns out, it's only a ground mount, even tried it in orgimmar. i want to know if thats how it's supposed to be, or is there some sort of bug? because it would be much cooler if it can fly. P.S, can the zandalari exalted mount fly? or is it only a ground mount as well?
As the yellow flavour text on the item says, poor little Kua'fon never did learn to fly... No soaring through the skies for him! The Zandalari Empire Pterrordax is a flying mount though. Enjoy your new dino mount. Blue Tracker [/b] ] Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17623892622?page=1#2
