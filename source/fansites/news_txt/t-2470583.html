Twin-Pipe Buster Cannon (https://www.wowdb.com/items/165600-twin-pipe-buster-cannon) bonus effect damage has been increased by 83%.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: While iterating on itemization feedback, we discovered that the Buster Cannon&#x2019;s effect had been tuned low. This should make it more competitive with other ranged weapons at similar item levels. Should you wish to restore a deleted Twin-Pipe Buster Cannon, please use our Item Restoration website: https://battle.net/support/restoration<br>
