Patch 7.3.2 - November 28 Hotfixes<br>
In addition to the PvP hotfixes posted last night (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7220-PvP-Hotfixes-with-Weekly-Maintenance), Shadow Priests had some changes.<br>
<br>
Priest<br>
<br>
Shadow<br>
<br>
Void Eruption (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/228260) no longer deals a separate damage event for each of your Shadow Word: Pain or Vampiric Touch on each target. Instead, it now deals a single damage event to all targets that have either your Shadow Word: Pain or Vampiric Touch.<br>
Void Eruption (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/228260) damage increased by 700%.<br>
Shadow Crash (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/205385) cooldown reduced to 20 seconds (was 30 seconds), Insanity generation increased to 20 (was 15), and Missile speed increased by 60%.<br>
Mind Sear (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48045) (Passive) damage increased by 50%.<br>
Heart of the Void (Legendary) increases Void Eruption&#x2019;s damage by 75% (was 300%) and heals you for 25% (was 40%) of the damage done.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; note: This is compensation for the Void Eruption buff. The overall effect is mostly neutral.<br>
<br>
Shadow Word: Pain (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/589) damage reduced by 4%.<br>
Vampiric Touch (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/34914) damage reduced by 4%.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; note: This is compensation for the Void Eruption buff in extended fights.</div></div>
