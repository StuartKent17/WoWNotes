Seething Shore<br>
<br>
Seething Shore is now in the Random Battleground queue, starting at level 110.<br>
Mining an Azerite Node now awards 20 Honor (was 40 Honor).<br>
The A Good Start achievement now requires 25,000 Azerite (was 100,000 Azerite).<br>
The Blood and Sand achievement now displays correctly when linked in chat.<br>
The &quot;Thrust&quot; effect from the Rocket Parachute now has 4 charges (was 2 charges), allowing players to reach further areas when jumping from the airship.<br>
The geyser period of Azerite nodes is now extended to 30 seconds (was 20 seconds). This will give players more time to reach spawning Azerite nodes.<br>
The respawn time at the graveyard is now 20 seconds (was 15 seconds).<br>
The time to cap an Azerite node is increased to 7 seconds (was 6 seconds).<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: We&#x2019;d like to thank you for all your feedback on this new Battleground. The adjustments above should alleviate some of its pacing issues, as well as bring its most-arduous achievement more in line with other battleground achievements.<br>
