is it intended for other classes to be able to enter the rogue order hall?
No, that's just an Alpha issue. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674341710948773889

Is the Garona in the Rogues Class hall the original timeline Garona? Or the Garona that became our follower?
This is the original timeline's Garona. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674341874052689920

Items
have a question about teleport items and northrend. Will Dalaran still exist there for porting. IE ring of Kirin Tor/Locket.
The items given out in Northrend will continue to send you to the Northrend version of Dalaran. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674342032987459584

Ion, thought you might want to know that Apocalypse http://beta.wowdb.com/items/128403-apocalypse's flavor text is wrong. You guys meant sow and not sew, right?
Hey, it's been known to crochet some seriously violent tapestries in its day. Ok, ok.... WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/674282443944411137


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
are you a little bored at your current job? Honest question, not trolling. It seems you had your hands full at Blizz
At Blizzard, I did some actual implementation work, fixed bugs and so on. I never have time for that any more, which is a bit sad. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672125954962030593

Any of you guys ever used calculus as part of a game design project? OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672125233550127104
I recall a couple instances of calc, but it's super rare. Not necessary, IMO. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672128513726484480
I have a math degree and I rarely use calc, why don't we teach stats in HS...
I would support teaching stats not calculus in HS! Where do I sign? OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672168144782266369

I remember doing differential equations on my design test. hwoome https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/672117689318432768
I certainly didn't ask them! OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672125272120909824
Haha. It was the question about ArPen. I really just used it as an excuse. hwoome https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/672130374164545537
