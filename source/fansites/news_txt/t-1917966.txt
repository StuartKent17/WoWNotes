is it intended for other classes to be able to enter the rogue order hall?
No, that's just an Alpha issue. WarcraftDevs 

Is the Garona in the Rogues Class hall the original timeline Garona? Or the Garona that became our follower?
This is the original timeline's Garona. WarcraftDevs 

Items
have a question about teleport items and northrend. Will Dalaran still exist there for porting. IE ring of Kirin Tor/Locket.
The items given out in Northrend will continue to send you to the Northrend version of Dalaran. WarcraftDevs 

Ion, thought you might want to know that Apocalypse 's flavor text is wrong. You guys meant sow and not sew, right?
Hey, it's been known to crochet some seriously violent tapestries in its day. Ok, ok.... WatcherDev 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
are you a little bored at your current job? Honest question, not trolling. It seems you had your hands full at Blizz
At Blizzard, I did some actual implementation work, fixed bugs and so on. I never have time for that any more, which is a bit sad. OccupyGStreet 

Any of you guys ever used calculus as part of a game design project? OccupyGStreet 
I recall a couple instances of calc, but it's super rare. Not necessary, IMO. Celestalon 
I have a math degree and I rarely use calc, why don't we teach stats in HS...
I would support teaching stats not calculus in HS! Where do I sign? OccupyGStreet 

I remember doing differential equations on my design test. hwoome 
I certainly didn't ask them! OccupyGStreet 
Haha. It was the question about ArPen. I really just used it as an excuse. hwoome
