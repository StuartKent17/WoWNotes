Unlocked appearances are account-wide and usable for transmogrification by other characters that can equip the item.
When first logging into a character after Patch 7.0, the appearances of appropriate items in your bags, bank, and Void Storage are learned automatically. Additional appearances will be unlocked based on previously-completed quests.
Transmogrifiers located in most major cities have been improved with additional features.Got a look that you like? Save the entire transmogrification set as an outfit. Create and swap between outfits at the Transmogrifier.
Additionally, transmogrifications can now be associated with your current specialization. Your outfit automatically changes when switching specializations if you so desire.

Equalized PvP Gear

Gear has been normalized in PvP combat. Characters entering a Skirmish Arena, Battleground, Rated Arena, Rated Battleground, or Ashran now receive an aura called Principles of War.
Principles of War removes all stats gained from gear Strength, Stamina, Haste, etc., disables gear related bonuses like trinket effects and set bonuses, and gives the character stats based on their specializations, and increases based on overall item level. The goal is to provide a much more finely tuned and balanced PvP experience.


Arenas

The pennant attached to the back of characters now changes its appearance based on the player’s best rating in the Arena bracket.

Battlegrounds

Characters below level 110 winning a Battleground are now awarded Crates of Battlefield Goods. The crate contains a piece of armor appropriate for the character’s level and specialization with a chance for the crate to contain additional rewards such as weapons or relics.


Raids and Dungeons

Legacy

Ruins of Ahn’Qiraj now resets daily instead of every 3 days.


Items and Itemization

Itemization

In an effort to reduce the amount of gear swapping between specializations, the following changes have been made.Legion cloaks, rings, and items worn on the neck are no longer tied to a specific primary stat, and will remain relevant between specializations.
Spirit and Bonus Armor have been removed.

Multistrike has been removed. Items that had multistrike have had it replaced with another secondary stat.
Trinkets obtained from Raids, PvP, and world drops in Warlords were overtuned and have been brought back to intended power levels.
Set bonuses for item sets from expansions prior to Warlords of Draenor have been deactivated, though the text describing their former function still remains.


Character Changes

Specialization System Changes

Characters can now change between any of their specializations at most any time for a progressive gold cost. Action bar configurations are saved for each specialization. As a result, Dual Specialization has been removed.
Characters can queue up as any role that is available to their class and will automatically switch to the suitable specialization when entering the Dungeon, Raid, Battleground, or Arena without any gold cost. For example, a paladin might be questing as Retribution but queue up in Dungeon Finder as a Tank. When the paladin enters the dungeon, they will automatically switch to Protection.


Updates to Combat Visuals and Audio

Armor Changes
