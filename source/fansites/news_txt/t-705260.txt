MMO-Champion has been down for a couple of hours today, this is what you get when you outsource everything to gnome engineers. The site itself didn't have any problem, it was just an issue with .... some technical stuff that I can't explain. I just cried a lot and spammed my very comprehensive and skilled tech team and we're now back online. 

Or maybe it was all part of a bigger plan.


Raidcomp Updated
Raidcomp  has been updated to fix tons of outdated stuff. There are still a few bug fixes on the way, but it should look better!

Armor % renamed to Physical Damage Reduction
Damage % - Added Arcane Empowerment
Damage Reduction % - Removed Grace, effect has been moved to Renewed Hope. 
Mana Regen Pet removed.
Mana Regen renamed to just "Mana Regen". Now includes Mana Spring Totem. 
Replenishment can now include Enduring Winter Frost Mage
Attack Power reduction - Include Vindication for Protection Paladins
Healing debuff - Fury Warriors' "Furious Attacks" delegated to a "maybe".
Melee Hit Chance Reduction: Insect Swarm and Scorpid Sting are marked as "maybe" since Balance Druids will glyph out of it and Hunters will often use another sting.
Hunter debuffs that are dependent on pets are declared as a "maybe".
Raid buff scrolls: Blessing of Kings, Mark of the Wild and Power Word: Fortitude as always marked as "maybe" once there are 1 or more of any class in the raid.

There is a slight bug with tooltips not working properly on spells and a few other things, most of them should be fixed by the end of the day.

Oh, look, it's monday! And it's the MMO Report  because I still like them.
