Important - To clarify a few things, I decided to use the internal item database of MMO-Champion http://db.mmo-champion.com yeah we actually have our own. Please keep in mind that even if most of the information is here it is not a real database and isn't meant to replace Wowhead or anything like that, it just helps having updated data during PTR testing. Also, it wasn't really supposed to go public and it's probably full of nasty bugs, we'll work on them. Please post feedback in this post http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=67292.0

Patch 3.2 now on PTRs
Patch 3.2 is now available for download and I will update the site A LOT in the next few hours, stay tuned!

Blood Plague: Damage done increased by 15%.
Blood Strike: The bonus damage this ability receives from diseases on the target has been increased to 25% per disease.
Chains of Ice: Now reduces movement by 95% instead of 100%. The main effect of this change will be that targets of Chains of Ice will not have to re-issue a movement command to continue moving.
Frost Fever: Damage done increased by 15%.

World Environment
Northrend Children's Week has arrived in Dalaran! Players can find out more by visiting the Eventide District.
Portal areas in all major cities now offer a portal to the Blasted Lands near the Dark Portal.
Once crossing through the Dark Portal, players can access a flight path directly from the Stair of Destiny to Shattrath.
A new zeppelin docking ramp has been added to Thunder Bluff allowing Horde players easier transport to and from Orgrimmar.
The local Postal Service has grown tired of walking so far each day to collect mail and has decided to install a large number of new mailboxes to Stormwind, Undercity, Darnassus and Orgrimmar.
Matias in Darnassus has finally earned himself enough money from your repair bills that he was able to buy himself an anvil.

New Models
A few models added with the patch.
