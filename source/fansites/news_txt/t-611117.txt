Interface
You can now compare your achievements with other players. Screenshot http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/july/achievements1.jpg
It seems that the action icon now appears when you mouseover the target frame of a NPC. It doesn't look like it's implemented yet but we can assume that in the future, we will be able to left click the frame of the NPC instead of his model to prevent all the issues caused by players blocking NPCs. 
The Death Knight starting area now have its own loading screen. Screenshot http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/july/dkloading.jpg
The first features of the threat meter have been added to the game. Screenshot #1 http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/july/threatmeter1.jpg Screenshot #2 http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/july/threatmeter2.jpg
- Your % of threat based on the member of the party with the highest threat on the monster is now displayed in the scrolling combat text.
- Your % of threat is now displayed in the tooltips of monsters.
- According to the first reports, the threat is just sent to the client without any encoding now, it will be very easy to build mods to display the exact threat of each member of the raid in the future.

WotLK Beta Build 8719 Tonight
A new build is being deployed on WotLK Beta servers. As usual, stay tuned for all the changes ! 
The beta realms will be going down at 10:00 PM CEST to apply an update. We anticipate approximately six hours of downtime. 

Your patience and understanding are appreciated.

This also includes a client patch or is this only a server patch?
Client; 8719 I believe. Should be fun to see what it brings... but a shame I'm going to be well and truly asleep when the realm's up again! Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8557299338&sid=2003
