WarcraftSecrets https://twitter.com/WarcraftSecrets/status/1140393688272723969 pointed out that Patch 8.2 adds Experience Eliminated https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/206662-experience-eliminated, which reduces XP from mobs and quests by 95% if anyone in the group has experience disabled. This was likely done to stop Level 110 characters from boosting players to 120 quickly.
