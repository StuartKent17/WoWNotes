Dual-spec switching
When they are actually in the game we'll have more details for you, but the idea is that you'll be able to switch between two specs much easier than porting to a home city, resetting talents, clicking a whole bunch, and setting up the new abilities on your action bars.

Simplifying mana regeneration stats
This is something that is totally on our radar. Mana regen requires looking at a lot of different numbers and we'd like to simplify it, without losing any of the interesting gear options that players have. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13129077831-please-simplify-mana-stats.html

Ooooh, it'll reset the action bars too? 
It's something that was brought up as a possibility, but it isn't a guarantee until it's in the game. I just listed the process as it is right now and we want to make things go smoother. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/13129077930-how-do-dual-specs-work.html

Malygos Vortex http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=56105 nerf and class diversity
The Malygos Vortex is the kind of thing we have to do to challenge AE healing because otherwise groups can pretty much trivialize it. This is one of the reasons we think Wild Growth and Circle of Healing need to be nerfed. If those spells aren't so powerful, then vortex and similar moments don't have to be so intense either and we'll be able to nerf it if needed.

Gotta Go! http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1860" Achievement
We're going to add some time to the completion timer in an upcoming patch so obtaining the achievement won't require the more extreme group compositions and strategies being used. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/13129153683-gotta-go-achievment.html

Druid scaling
-- When you talk about scaling, you have to separate a few different issues:
1 Does the class / talent / spell scale?
2 Does it scale well once it has good gear?
3 Does that gear actually exist?
4 Is it readily available or is it hard to get?
-- Some classes complain about having too many stats and others about not having enough stats. They are just different class styles. There are advantages and disadvantages to both.
-- Our goal is not that every stat is useful for you.
-- Our goal is not that only stats which are useful for you appear on your gear.
-- One of the interesting things about resto seems to be that there is some player preference involved in how you heal. Some use Regrowth a lot now, others use Healing Touch, and others stick with rolling blooms. While it may end up that someone can prove one of those strategies sufficiently trumps the others, for now it is cool to see the experimentation.
-- That said, we do worry if Nourish's niche is too narrow. We'll see. It is getting compared to heals with very good glyphs affecting them. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/12454677501-the-druid-dilemma-worst-healers-postnaxx.html

Holy Paladins
I think it's a bit premature to declare that Holy paladins or any healer really can't keep up. In situations where a paladin can really benefit from Beacon, it may in fact be hard for others to keep up, but that won't be every fight.

If you look at the guilds who are doing the current end game content, they are using a lot of Holy pallys and those guys never seem to run out of mana. So presumably there are plenty of situations where they really shine. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13129067595-i-feel-a-bit-worthless--.html

Warlock Rotations
We have been talking about a couple of different approaches to warlock rotations. One is to try and make more of the dots last around the same duration so you aren't watching them quite so much. Another is just to lower the standard rotation from having so many dots. These are both things we are working on but it's too early to say what the changes will end up being.
