<br>
Patch 7.1 - Trial of Valor: Odyn<br>
Odyn is the first boss in the Trial of Valor raid coming in Patch 7.1. <br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pPUx4whdeeU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br>
<br>
In ages past, Odyn led the titan-forged armies against the Black Empire of the Old Gods. But for millennia he has been confined to the Halls of Valor by the curse of his bitter nemesis, Helya. Odyn seeks mortal champions to vanquish the ruler of Helheim and secure his freedom.<br>
<br>
<br>
Overview - Odyn challenges players to prove their worth before delving into Helheim to face Helya. Players begin the encounter facing Hymdall and Hyrja. After bringing both Hymdall and Hyrja to 25% health before they can cast Revivify, Odyn leaps into battle.<br>
<br>
At 55% health remaining, Odyn shows his true power and begins to fill the room with Cleansing Flame. When Odyn reaches 10% health, he is satisfied with your martial prowess, and allows you to become his champions in the fight against Helya.<br>
<br>
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/dps.png&quot; title=&quot;Dps&quot; /&gt; Damage Dealers - While Hyrja is active, help soak the damage of Shield of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/228162-shield-of-light).<br>
While Hymdall is active, avoid standing near other players as he casts Horn of Valor (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/228012-horn-of-valor).<br>
When Odyn casts Draw Power (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227503-draw-power), quickly move the Valajrar Runebearers to their matching rune and slay them on it to disable the rune, lowering the damage of Unerring Blast (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227629-unerring-blast).<br>
Move away from other players when afflicted by Storm of Justice (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227959-storm-of-justice).<br>

While Hymdall is active, avoid standing near other players as Horn of Valor (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/228012-horn-of-valor) hits nearby allies.<br>
When Odyn casts Draw Power (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227503-draw-power), quickly move the Valajrar Runebearers to their matching rune and slay them on it to disable the rune, lowering the damage of Unerring Blast (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227629-unerring-blast).<br>
Move away from other players when afflicted by Storm of Justice (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227959-storm-of-justice).<br>
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/tank.png&quot; title=&quot;Tank&quot; /&gt; Tanks - While Hymdall and Hyrja are active, position them carefully to avoid Valarjar&apos;s Bond (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/228018-valarjars-bond) .<br>
Odyn&apos;s Test (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227626-odyns-test) will stack until Odyn melee attacks a different target.<br>

Battle.net Update<br>
We&#x2019;re going to be transitioning away from using the Battle.net name for our gaming service and the functionality connected to it. Battle.net technology will continue to serve as the central nervous system for Blizzard games&#x2014;nothing is changing in that regard. We&#x2019;ll just be referring to it as Blizzard tech instead. You&apos;ve already seen this recently with things like &quot;Blizzard Streaming&quot; and &quot;Blizzard Voice,&quot; and more changes are on the way.<br>
<br>
When we created Battle.net, the idea of including a tailored online-gaming service together with your game was more of a novel concept, so we put a lot of focus on explaining what the service was and how it worked, including giving it a distinct name. Over time, though, we&#x2019;ve seen that there&#x2019;s been occasional confusion and inefficiencies related to having two separate identities under which everything falls&#x2014;Blizzard and Battle.net. Given that built-in multiplayer support is a well-understood concept and more of a normal expectation these days, there isn&#x2019;t as much of a need to maintain a separate identity for what is essentially our networking technology.<br>
<br>
We just wanted to make sure everyone was aware as we moved forward with this change over the next several months; we&#x2019;ll provide any relevant updates as the transition progresses.<br>
<br>

Upcoming Class Tuning<br>
Just as a note, in case you missed his other tweets while being tied down on this one: we have a tuning pass that will come with next week&apos;s restarts.<br>
<br>
You should see information on these start coming out in the next few days, but keep an eye on our hotfix notes and WarcraftDevs for more information. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/769167-nerfs-are-not-a-joke-lore/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20749205438?page=17#339))<br>
<br>
Upcoming Class Tuning and PTR Changes<br>
No tuning has been done, so lets not yell about the sky falling here. Anything you are seeing from data-mining is simply either inaccurate or small edits to tooltips.<br>
<br>
We will have a tuning pass coming with next week&apos;s restarts, and you will start see information on this in the next few days. Keep an eye on the hotfix notes and WarcraftDevs for more information.<br>
<br>
Those Windwalker 7.1 nerfs aren&apos;t real? They&apos;re REALLY specific, like the Fists of Fury one that would probably gore Windwalker in PvP. I don&apos;t understand datamining though so I have no idea.<br>
We will have to wait and see what comes from our tuning pass to understand any upcoming 7.1 changes.<br>
<br>
Asking for your patience here while we get tuning out the door before we talk too much about 7.1 which is a bit down the road. <br>
<br>
I think quite a few people did their own math by recording DPS before the nerfs took affect and recording them after. Some people recorded the difference post-nerf was close to 25-30% damage reduction.<br>
<br>
I haven&apos;t seen logs or any actual data. But that&apos;s what people are saying.<br>
Of course - I double checked our hotfix, and can confirm that it was a 10% across the board reduction. Anything other than that seems to be faulty data (maybe as a result of other changes?).<br>
<br>
Regardless, sims and player testing can and do have their faults. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/769172-i-hope-these-nerfs-are-a-joke/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20749215441?page=5#81))<br>

Patch 7.1<br>
Can we have an update on the Karazhan Attuement with a &quot;Follower Mission&quot; I thought these were optional? Now a dungeon is gated!<br>
The attunement questline primarily consists of dungeon runs (a la TBC) - I wouldn&apos;t read too much into early PTR. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/776464757431775232))<br>
<br>
Classes<br>
for stat templates, are players base 800 iLvl or 850 iLvl? seeing some mixed answers<br>
You get stats like you&apos;re 850. We determine whether you get a buff by comparing your ilevel to 800. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/776556791408623616))<br>
<br>
They should drop on par gear with heroic dungeons. Currently, i dont see any incentive to play matchmade battlegrounds.<br>
Agreed but unfortunately cannot be fixed until 7.1. Sorry. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/776167192849182720))<br>
Specifically we&apos;re going to increase the ilevel based on your honor level but cannot do it yet. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/776168002010091521))</div></div>
