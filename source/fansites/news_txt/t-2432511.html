<br>
<br>
Prot warriors in 8.1<br>
Shamans got a blue; Here&apos;s to hoping Warriors get one.<br>
<br>
I won&apos;t make a massive OP, there&apos;s been tomes written on how broken prot was since earliest stages of BfA beta. It&apos;s common knowledge that warriors make up for under 5% of all tank representation after 2 weeks of Uldir, in ALL types of content;<br>
<br>
They&apos;re weak, they lack a niche, their kit has been massively hurt by the GCD change, and they need a lot of love to become viable. Like. Without exaggeration, it&apos;s easier to heal a shadow priest who pulls aggro in a dungeon, than a prot warrior in that same dungeon...<br>
<br>
Blizzard? Are you doing this one class at a time, or can prots hope for some love as well? Cause it honestly feels really bad when the most iconic tank in the game is just so far behind it&apos;s not even worth using any more...<br>
I can&#x2019;t speak to any plans for the patch, but I do know that we&#x2019;re planning to make some tuning adjustments sometime in the next few weeks which should include some defensive buffs for Protection Warriors. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1101836-prot-warriors-in-81/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769068522?page=1#18))<br>
<br>
Just curious but why can&apos;t you speak to any plans for the patch? You explained the tooltips for the proposed ele shaman changes, but can&apos;t speak about warriors? Or is it that there is nothing changing in the patch for warriors?<br>
Few reasons. Partially because I&apos;m not a class designer, so I don&apos;t make those decisions. But also because the class team themselves haven&apos;t decided yet. We agree Prot Warriors need love, but aren&apos;t 100% decided on exactly what form those changes will take, which also means we don&apos;t know if it&apos;ll need to be in a patch or not. The Elemental changes require a patch, otherwise we&apos;d just hotfix them in.<br>
<br>
Regarding this upcoming tuning pass, I wouldn&apos;t expect it to be something that solves every Prot Warrior grievance, but it should hopefully help while we look into potential further adjustments.<br>
<br>
Hate to say it (and hate to nail it to you Lore) but class imbalance is very very bad right now. I think most of us don&apos;t want classes that are OP or overtuned-- but we would like to see them fluid enough and competitive enough that we can feel comfortable that our individual investment will ensure us a spot and a chance at current WoW content.<br>
Class balance is definitely a sore spot right now, both in community feedback and our own internal discussions. We&apos;re working on it. It&apos;s a delicate thing; we want to solve the issue of players feeling like their class is undesired, but we also want to avoid the opposite issue where everyone feels like they need to reroll to whatever the new hotness is every few weeks (side note, that&apos;s part of why we do tuning adjustments in batches rather than every few days, to give things a little time to stabilize before the next round).<br>
<br>
I&apos;d also like to submit the argument that, while class balance certainly isn&apos;t perfect right now, it&apos;s also the beginning of an expansion, which is *always* a bit shaky for class balance. There are absolutely outliers on either side of the spectrum, with some buffs and most likely some nerfs incoming, but aside from those few cases, our data (based on hundreds of thousands of boss kills, arena matches, etc) is showing that class balance isn&apos;t that far out of whack from how things were at the start of Legion, or Warlords, or Mists, etc.<br>
<br>
But like I said, we&apos;re working on it, and will have more to share soon. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1101836-prot-warriors-in-81/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769068522?page=2#24))<br>

Vicious Saddles in Battle for Azeroth<br>
Hey guys! This is something we&apos;ve seen y&apos;all ask about and just wanted to share some insight to the Vicious Saddle mounts.<br>
<br>
Currently, players can earn Vicious Saddles through the &#x201C;Veteran of the Alliance&#x201D; or &#x201C;Veteran of the Horde&#x201D; series of per-character achievements. We&#x2019;re also working on some new ways players can earn Vicious Saddles in the next major content update, Tides of Vengeance.<br>
<br>
Note that the Battle for Azeroth seasonal mounts will not be added to the saddle vendor until sometime after the conclusion of the final Battle for Azeroth PvP season. Until then, the only way to earn these mounts will be to actively participate in the associated PvP season.<br>

PvP Brawl: Shado-Pan Showdown No Credit<br>
We&apos;re pushing a hotfix out shortly with the quest not correctly giving credit with Shado-pan Showdown. We&apos;re also increasing the reward, and resetting the quest so those who already completed it can complete it again.<br>
<br>
You should see that reflected in game soon&#x2122; (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1101834-pvp-brawl-shado-pan-showdown-no-credit/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769108612?page=3#50))</div></div>
