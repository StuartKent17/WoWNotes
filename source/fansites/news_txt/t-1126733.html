It was announced during the Mists of Pandaria Press Tour that mounts would become account-wide on release or in a patch shortly after. It looks like it will be release after all, and the feature is now available on beta (but heavily bugged). <br>
<br>
I present to you, my mage riding my paladin&apos;s mount! (Obviously, we have no way to know if this is intended as part of the account-wide mounts)<br>

Pandaren Voices now on Beta<br>
Pandaren Voices are now also partially available on beta. For the moment only a few NPCs will talk to you but it should give you a good idea of where the game is headed for their voices. <br>

Teleporting to Mogu&apos;shan Palace<br>
There&apos;s an NPC in Dawnblossom (he&apos;s the Mogu who looks horribly out of place) that will teleport you to Mogu&apos;shan Palace even if you are a ghost.

Scarlet Monastery Cathedral bug on Beta<br>
Yep, the collision on the cathedral door is indeed totally broken and you can&apos;t get to the last boss. We&apos;ll fix this as soon as we can, but it might take a beta update or two for the fix to reach you all.

PvP and bringing the &quot;War&quot; back in World of Warcraft<br>
We&apos;re with you on the idea of getting people engaged in PvP again within the world. As I&apos;ve said previously though, we have to be careful about how we do that. We&apos;ll hopefully have more information for you all on what we have planned that will assuage some fears of those who aren&apos;t very PvP passionate, while (hopefully) still making PvP compelling for those who do love taking part. (Raises her hand) While we have many players who enjoy PvP, we have a larger contingent that enjoys PvE more. That makes maintaining balance between the concepts a bit more challenging, but we love challenges.<br>
<br>
As far as the story goes, we&apos;ve talked a bit about that and what&apos;s coming is twofold. War is coming to Pandaria, which (while it&apos;s had its strife in the past) is largely a peaceful region of Azeroth. That&apos;s going to change as the Horde and Alliance start stirring up the dust of the past. Beyond what happens in Pandaria, the Horde and Alliance will be at each others&apos; throats once more. We&apos;ve mentioned it many times before, but we really do feel that the &quot;war&quot; of Warcraft is going to be featured a bit more prominently in the story. It may not necessarily translate to all out chaos in a direct PvP way, but it will definitely be seen playing out in the storyline itself.<br>
<br>
Again, we&apos;ll try to bring you more information specifically about the PvP end of our plans (more detail of what was heard from the press event) and get everyone caught up to speed on what we hope this will mean going forward.
