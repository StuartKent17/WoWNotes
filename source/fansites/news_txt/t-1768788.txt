Raid Testing Schedule - April 29-30
This Wednesday and Thursday, we will continue our Hellfire Citadel raid testing. As is always the case with PTR raid testing, it is quite possible that there will be technical or gameplay issues that disrupt our plans. Thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.

Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Our general plan is to test every encounter on Heroic difficulty first, and then test sections of the raid on Normal and Raid Finder, alongside targeted Mythic tests.

Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below on all PTR servers.

Wednesday, April 29

Hellfire High Council - Heroic Hellfire Citadel - 13:30 PDT 16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST
Mannoroth - Heroic Hellfire Citadel - 15:00 PDT 18:00 EDT, 24:00 CEST

Thursday, April 30

Hellfire Assault - Heroic Hellfire Citadel - 13:30 PDT 16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST
Socrethar the Eternal - Heroic Hellfire Citadel - 15:00 PDT 18:00 EDT, 24:00 CEST

After the conclusion of our final Thursday test, we will open the Halls of Blood Raid Finder wing Council, Kilrogg, and Gorefiend, and we plan to leave that wing active through the weekend. There will be no scheduled Friday testing.

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.

Skill Cap and Ratings
The only way to achieve high ratings as a good player is to play with other good players. However, you will never be able to improve your rating achievements unless your entire team gets better together.
I'm having a hard time seeing how that's a bad thing. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding your post, but it sounds like you're saying that one good player should be able to carry two bad players to top ratings. If that's the case, we just don't agree.

1. You're completely missing the point that lowering the skill cap actually deters high rated players from playing with low rated players because of that reason.
Yeah, this is the part of your post I don't get. I'm not seeing why you think that's the case. If the game is made easier for low-rated players, wouldn't that just mean the one highly-skilled player on the team has less work to do?

2. It's a bad thing when really great players can outplay the other team hard and NOT be rewarded for that outplay.
Agreed. I just don't think that that reward needs to be "able to win regardless of what my teammates are doing."

3. It's MUCH harder to climb the ladder unless you play with high ranked players.
It is much easier to earn high rating if you play with highly-skilled players, yes. Again, I'm not seeing the problem. Official Forums
