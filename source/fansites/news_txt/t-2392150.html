Battle for Azeroth Alpha - Build 26476 Broadcast Text<br>
Taelia Fordragon<br>
On behalf of the Alliance, I welcome all of you. May the Light protect us.<br>
King Wrynn, there is someone else you should meet.<br>
Along with your champion, she was instrumental in saving our kingdom - and my life.<br>
It is an honor to meet you, King Wrynn. I am Taelia.<br>
Taelia Fordragon.<br>
Fordragon?!<br>
Bolvar&apos;s daughter. Raised under our protection since the Third War.<br>
Taelia... please, rise. The honor is mine.<br>
Did you know my father?<br>
Highlord Bolvar was a great man. A true hero of the Alliance - and to me.<br>
I remember now - he used to write you letters. He had a nickname for you-<br>
&quot;My shining star.&quot;<br>
The letters stopped coming. I... I have so many questions.<br>
Taelia, when you are ready, come to Stormwind. I will tell you all you wish to know about your father.<br>
<br>
<br>
Taelia, ma&apos;am.<br>
Taelia... Of course. Our young ward from across the sea. Has it already been so long?<br>
You&apos;ve grown into a valiant young woman, Taelia. Your father would be proud.<br>
<br>
When Daelin asked me to leave his guard and raise this child of the Eastern Kingdoms, I struggled to understand why. <br>
Why thrust this burden on me? Why deny me the honor of fighting by his side? I thought maybe I had done something to lose his faith. <br>
Over the years, I have come to realize that the opposite was true. He wanted Taelia to grow up strong of arm and noble of heart - and he had faith that I could make that happen.<br>
<br>
King Greymane, it is an honor. You are free to remain in the harbor on my authority.<br>
Taelia! Prepare a full briefing for our guests.<br>
Aye, sir!<br>
<br>
Sir! The situation report is ready!<br>
Excellent. Hero, Taelia will get you up to speed.<br>
<br>
Be careful out there, Taelia. I don&apos;t trust those hooded sages one bit.<br>
I&apos;ll be fine, Cyrus. I can protect myself. Besides, I have the Alliance emissary by my side!<br>
Normally, I&apos;d offer you a ride on Galeheart, but the tidesages only allow visitors by boat.<br>
Most people here look to the sea for guidance the same way others look to the Light, but the tidesages have a much deeper connection with the water.<br>
They&apos;re a little mysterious, but they&apos;re important to Kul Tiras. They help bring fish to the nets here, and rain to the fields in the valley.<br>
They also bless every last Kul Tiran ship. That&apos;s what really sets them apart from the visiting vessels you see in port.<br>
Anyway, time to put that ferry pass to good use!<br>
<br>
Flynn, I have another job for you: Help our new ally track down the source of this powder.<br>
You got it.<br>
Taelia, prepare to make your rounds again. Tell the city guard to be on the lookout for unusual weapons being smuggled into Boralus.<br>
Aye, sir!<br>
<br>
Thank you all for coming. I shall keep this brief.<br>
Division has made us vulnerable. We are beset by enemies from within.<br>
The Horde, too, have made their intentions clear - they would see us burn.<br>
I ask you now to put your faith in my daughter Jaina, the true Lord Admiral of Kul Tiras.<br>
And to put your trust in the Alliance, whose heroes have saved us from our own unmaking.<br>
House Waycrest stands with you, Lord Admiral. And with the Alliance.<br>
<br>
<br>
Vol&apos;jin<br>
If the Horde want war, we&apos;re going to give them everything we&apos;ve got!<br>
Our reinforcements await your command.<br>
<br>
The dead, dey be fallin&apos;.<br>
Zalazane not be comin&apos; back from dat. Even in death, Vol&apos;jin be watchin&apos; over us.<br>
Few spirits have ever shown such... power. Master Gadrin, I invite you to bring this chieftain&apos;s ashes to Atal&apos;Dazar. If his spirit be worthy, he may have a place of honor amongst our greatest kings.<br>
<br>
Vol&apos;jin made a deal with Bonsamdi to defeat the powerful Zalazane.<br>
<br>
Hey Vol&apos;jin? Come on outta dat urn. Wait... wait wait... no! Where is de spirit?! Where be Vol&apos;jin?<br>
No! No! Impossible. Da boss ain&apos;t gonna like dis. I ain&apos;t lost a spirit in... oh dis be bad.<br>
<br>
We come bearing da ashes of Vol&apos;jin, son of Sen&apos;jin, to be honored in dis sacred place.<br>
Dis be an honor seldom awarded to a non Zandalari. Come, walk the path with me and share this Vol&apos;jin&apos;s deeds.<br>
When Zandalar tried to unite da troll tribes, Vol&apos;jin chose the safety of his people to the dark powers of da prophet.<br>
At de time, Zul&apos;s vision of a grand troll empire seemed very tempting to my father. But I must commend ya chieftain for seeing de bigger picture.<br>
When it was clear our Warchief, Garrosh, was unwilling to lead with honor, Vol&apos;jin led the rebellion to depose da warmonger.<br>
It is a hard thing to do what your leaders are unwilling to.<br>
The right to enter is yours. Let it be known dat I find Vol&apos;jin, son of Sen&apos;jin, worthy of dese sacred tombs. Though to enter Atal&apos;Dazar you may need to fight. I recommend de champion be de one to carry dese ashes to dere final resting place.<br>
<br>
War Campaign, Island Expeditions, and Warfronts<br>
I need you and Garona Halforcen to assemble a covert unit of Horde champions.<br>
It seems goblins have their uses after all. They continue to discover new deposits of Azerite spread throughout the vast seas.<br>
We must seize the advantage and explore these islands before the Alliance can take them for themselves.<br>
Stromgarde is ripe for the plucking. Should we secure the keep, it will set the stage for a campaign against the Alliance from the heart of the Eastern Kingdoms.<br>
Take the Arathi Highlands, and the enemy will be at our mercy.<br>
Your conversion of Brother Zelling already yields promising results. He has revealed the location of the shipwreck we seek.<br>
I advise you to use the cover of night to perform your search for the remains.<br>
Nathanos, I want you there personally to see that our mission succeeds. You will also be provided with a rather... unique... escort.<br>
You will then send these champions on critical missions throughout Kul Tiras and Zandalar.<br>
You have been reliable thus far -- I trust you will not fail me.<br>
<br>
Nathanos Blightcaller and Garona<br>
Your strikes on Alliance targets have been most impressive, Garona. I admit, I wondered if your loyalties might be... <br>
Because I was once befriended by the young king&apos;s grandfather? I murdered him, if you recall.<br>
I am familiar with the tale. I also know that killing Llane Wrynn was not your choice.<br>
No. And you are doubtless aware that I have worked with the Alliance when it served my purposes. But I owe them nothing. The Horde is my home.<br>
Good. The Alliance deserves no sympathy. No quarter. Make them suffer, and the Dark Lady will reward you.<br>
I caused the downfall of one king. Perhaps it is time I ended the reign of another.<br>
The zeal with which you attack the Alliance seems born of more than deference to your queen, Blightcaller.<br>
I once fought for their cause. The Alliance&apos;s insufferable arrogance has increased tenfold since they turned their backs on us.<br>
Turned their backs?<br>
When the Lich King&apos;s hold over us was broken, Sylvanas sought allies. Instead of embracing their fallen kin of Lordaeron, the humans spurned us. Hunted us. So I vowed to hunt them.<br>
Vengeance fuels you. I can appreciate that.<br>
Vengeance. Contempt. Call it what you will.<br>
When the last of his subjects has been slain and raised Forsaken, the boy-king will kneel before the Dark Lady. And at long last, there will be but one queen to rule them all.<br>
<br>
Burning of Teldrassil<br>
&lt; Shandris&apos;s keen eyes scan the horizon. She nods at you in acknowledgement. &gt;<br>
What is your strategy, Shandris?<br>
My strategy?<br>
Find Sunwatcher, then fill him with arrows.<br>
<br>
Darkness... Sylvanas... is this what you saw... what you wished to save us from?<br>
Shandris, it&apos;s been... two, three thousand years? To think we&apos;d meet again like this.<br>
I am destined to live for eternity, I will not die here!<br>
You should have died a long time ago, Areiel. We&apos;re here to see that happens.<br>
It&apos;s a shame you&apos;re fighting alongside this filthy human, Shandris! Such short, insignificant lives.<br>
Even in your final moments, you fail to see the true potential of humans.<br>
<br>
Shan&apos;do! I came as quickly as I could! I saw the Warchief headed towards Zoram&apos;gar outpost.<br>
She has come for us, Delaryn. The Warchief has come to capture the World Tree.<br>
Our troops, Shan&apos;do -- Tyrande sent them to defend our outpost in Silithus days ago.<br>
Then there is still time! Delaryn, go forth and muster as many troops as possible from our nearby outposts.<br>
$n, travel to Darnassus. Gather as many able-bodied soldiers as you can, but do not leave the city unguarded.<br>
I will intercept our fleet and bring them back to Darnassus.<br>
Now, make haste! This wall will slow them down, but it will not hold forever.<br>
You may pass through the wall unharmed, $n. The wisps will not harm you.<br>
I&apos;m on it!<br>
<br>
General Feathermoon, the Horde have invaded Darkshore!<br>
We must take action! Sentinels, forward face!<br>
Fourth Fleet, you are to reinforce the southern border of Darkshore! Bring the Glaive Throwers!<br>
Fifth Fleet, create a ley line at the Wildbend River! Rouse our allies at the Grove of the Ancients!<br>
Hippogryph Archers, come with me -- we will regroup in Lor&apos;danel and remain vigilant as a mobile response unit!<br>
That leaves you, hero. Report back to Captain Summermoon and reinforce that border!<br>
I have something that can help.<br>
<br>
The Horde has set fire to the buildings! Put them out before the whole valley goes up in flames!<br>
Good work! The fires recede, and we still have our homes. Thank you.<br>
The Horde has returned in force to try and finish the job. Stop them by any means necessary!<br>
They are driven back for now, and the town still stands. We owe you our lives.<br>
We have managed to seize another one of the Horde&apos;s siege weapons. Time to turn the tables on their forces!<br>
Hah, you sure sent them packing! It will take some time for their forces to mobilize again. Good work.<br>
<br>
Blood Prince Dreven and Gallywix<br>
We will deal with Blood Prince Dreven soon, General. But this is a rare opportunity to cripple the Horde&apos;s military. Everything else must wait.<br>
We can kill that gluttonous goblin any day! If Dreven escapes, we may never find him again.<br>
Gallywix funds the Horde&apos;s war campaign and understands Azerite better than the rest of them.<br>
You saw what Dreven was capable of, Wyrmbane. What if there are more like him?<br>
Forgive my interruption, but I believe you&apos;re both right.<br>
We cannot let either of these opportunities escape us... And we don&apos;t need to.<br>
Allow your new allies, the void elves, to lead the charge in eliminating Gallywix.<br>
We will hunt him down and bring you his head, while Shandris maintains our focus on tracking that Blood Prince.<br>
A wise strategy. I approve.<br>
Thank you, Alleria. Your aid is most welcome.<br>
<br>
The Tortollan<br>
Let&apos;s go over the plan to kill Captain Areiel.<br>
Captain Areiel&apos;s death will cripple the Horde&apos;s operations within Nazmir and weaken Sylvanas&apos;s dark rangers.<br>
We need information and allies within Nazmir to achieve this. Lucky for us, we have an opportunity. Keeshan?<br>
Thank you, ma&apos;am. Several tortollan have been captured by blood trolls nearby. We know the tortollan have helped the Horde within Nazmir.<br>
We save the tortollan, we get information about the Horde&apos;s movements, which should lead us to Captain Areiel.<br>
We move out now. $n will take point. The rest of us will provide support and scout ahead. Keeshan, that includes you.<br>
Ma&apos;am.<br>
<br>
Brother Zelling<br>
No, but can you answer my question? When you become Forsaken, are you purged of any sicknesses?<br>
It&apos;s not exactly a science, becoming Forsaken. You might stay the same, become a completely different person... or maybe you might actually just die.<br>
Did Captain Stone go mad when she turned? I&apos;m well aware of what happened to her.<br>
We all go a little mad when we become Forsaken. Some more than others.<br>
<br>
Alright, Zelling. Do you understand, truly understand, what&apos;s about to happen?<br>
Yes! Eternal life, granted to me at last, I am ready for it!<br>
<br>
Zelling! Damn you, we need you alive!<br>
Miss Voss, please... bring me back... I must help my family... I&apos;ll do anything... anything...<br>
You&apos;ll be shunned if you become one of us. You look in a mirror and all you&apos;ll see is a monster.<br>
I would... damn my soul... for all eternity... if it meant my family&apos;s happiness... please! You must...<br>
You... must...<br>
Lilian. We can find other tidesages. You know his family won&apos;t accept him.<br>
We&apos;ll see, maybe it can be different, just this one time.<br>
Lilian Voss. Why have you called upon me?<br>
Bring this man back. He has been chosen to become Forsaken.<br>
As you command, by the power granted to you from Lady Sylvanas.<br>
I... I live! Haha! I must go see Julia and the children, they will be delighted!<br>
... I guess we&apos;ll have to see what happens now.<br>
<br>
For the last time, STAY BACK! You are NOT my husband!<br>
Why won&apos;t you UNDERSTAND?! It&apos;s me, your husband... children it&apos;s your daddy!<br>
Stay away!<br>
Momma I&apos;m scared of the zombie!<br>
Daddy is right here, just listen to my voice! Why aren&apos;t you understanding this?!<br>
Keep it away!<br>
Momma help us!<br>
Quiet!<br>
Leave us be!<br>
Get it away!<br>
Make the monster go away!<br>
THAT&apos;S ENOUGH!<br>
I... I...<br>
I don&apos;t know who you are, but my husband NEVER tried to hurt me or his children. We are leaving... do not follow us!<br>
No... Julia... Matthew... Hannah... what have I done? What.. am I?<br>
I tried to warn you, Zelling. The process changes you. People won&apos;t accept you anymore.<br>
And what am I left with? Become a mindless servant to Sylvanas?<br>
You serve no one. Join the Forsaken and carve your own path. You&apos;ll be amongst those who accept you for what you&apos;ve become.<br>
I will join the you... and help you find Captain Valentine. As long as you promise that my family remains unharmed.<br>
You have my word. Come. $n, return to Nathanos and inform him that we have what we need.<br>
<br>
Athair, Heart of the Forest<br>
One day while Lord Arom was hunting for food in the forest he came upon a massive white stag.<br>
The stag had been attacked by the Drust and had killed many but was injured.<br>
Lord Arom&apos;s people needed food and the massive deer would feed many, but he decided not to strike.<br>
&quot;Anyone who can fight off so many Drust is someone I wish to have in my forests,&quot; he thought. So Lord Arom healed the stag&apos;s injuries.<br>
The stag bounded into the woods and Arom made camp.<br>
In the night, the Drust attacked!<br>
Lord Arom stood against ten warriors! He fought valiantly and with cunning but he was out numbered and surrounded!<br>
Determined to take down as many warriors as he could, he held his ground.<br>
A mighty bellow came from the forest!<br>
The white stag returned and trampled some of the Drust!<br>
Together Arom and the White Stag fought the warriors and defeated them.<br>
&quot;Thank you, my friend,&quot; Arom said to the stag.<br>
&quot;You are welcome. I was repaying the kindness you showed me.&quot;<br>
&quot;By the light! You can speak!&quot; Arom exclaimed!<br>
&quot;I am Athair, the Heart of this forest. As long as I exist, I shall protect you and yours should they come to me,&quot; the stag said.<br>
The he turned and vanished into the woods. Since then, the valiant and true have found shelter with the White Stag of the forest.<br>
<br>
Gaston<br>
No one strikes like Gaston!<br>
Whirls with spikes like Gaston!<br>
No one&apos;s magic decoys look lifelike like Gaston&apos;s!<br>
I cannot die, I&apos;m... Gas..ton...</div></div>
