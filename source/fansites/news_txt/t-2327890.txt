Join us for the World of Warcraft Live Q&A at BlizzCon 2017
On Saturday, November 4, from 4:00pm to 5:00pm PDT in Hall D Mythic Stage, the World of Warcraft Development Team will take the stage for the World of Warcraft Live Q&A to answer the questions you’ve been dying to know about Azeroth and beyond! Join the Development Team and get answers to all your questions about lore, zones, dungeons, raids, and more.

For those of you not at the convention, or who wish to submit questions off the floor, we will be creating a thread on Friday, November 3 following the World of Warcraft – What’s Next panel ending at 1:30pm PDT. The thread will close for submission at 6:00am PDT on Saturday, November 4.

If you have question you’d like to submit for the World of Warcraft BlizzCon Live Q&A, please use that thread once it is posted.

In the meantime, here are some things to consider for your question submission:


Please keep your question brief and to the point. If you see a question in the thread you would like to see an answered, please up-vote it. As you may expect, we will receive many submissions both online and at the convention. We will not be able to answer all of them, but we will get to as many as we are able. Make sure you’re asking a question versus making a statement.

We’ll see you at BlizzCon!
