Addon - Legion Invasion Timer
The Legion Invasion Timer addon  is helpful for keeping track of upcoming invasions if you are still working on Defender of the Broken Isles

Legionfall United Proc Rate
We've double and triple checked, but I just wanted to confirm that no changes have been made to Legionfall United  - and the ability is still functioning as it should.

Seems like it was just a spot of bad luck that a few folks shared! Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Upcoming Mythic Keystone Changes
To clarify: with these changes, the chest at the end of each Mythic+ run would contain a total of 3 items 2 if you don't beat the timer. That's split across the group, not per-person. 

So yes, it's fewer total items than a 3-chest finish in 7.2. However, it's an increase in items for players doing 1-chest clears at an appropriate difficulty level. This is also why I mentioned that the difficulty cap for M+ will be increasing to 15 once Tomb opens on Mythic. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Upcoming Crypt Fever Change
Crypt Fever is changing to have a high chance on each healing event to deal more damage than it does currently on live. This change is to smooth out the Honor Talent's power based on the type of healer you are facing, while still keeping an emphasis that this is powerful against heal over time effects. We'll be tuning the proc rate and internal cooldown to make sure we're hitting the numbers we want against each type of healer.

Fix Necrotic Strike! 
Changes to Necrotic Strike are coming in 7.2.5 too! Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Bewmaster Tier 20 Set Bonuses
FYI, the datamined Brewmaster T20 bonuses are an old draft. New draft is this:

2T20: Drinking a Brew triggers Gift of the Ox.
4T20: Gift of the Ox orbs also purify 10% of your staggered damage.

For clarification, numbers in that set bonus idea are not final thus calling it a draft. We're thinking now that 10% is likely too high, but that the concept sounds good. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Fists of Fury
The increased range is becoming baseline for PvE, so that's why.
Correct, Fists of Fury is gaining a range increase baseline, so this part of the Honor Talent has been removed. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 


FEEDBACK: Tomb of Sargeras Raid Trinkets
Please post any feedback you may have regarding the trinkets that will drop in Tomb of Sargeras  in this thread. The trinkets will be for sale in Dalaran from Tombataur as soon as a hotfix is applied.

All of the Nighthold trinkets are also for sale to allow for better side by side comparison. The tuning on these trinkets at time of posting is in the right general area, but outliers may exist and are subject to future tuning.

We have no plans to change any existing trinkets from the Nighthold at this time. Changing trinkets that players have collected over the course of the last few months is our last course of action, as having things that used to be cool that you are relying on to kill bosses become not cool so you can collect new things is rude at best.

Any plans to fix this whole tank situation i.e. guardian druids in arenas?
We're looking into tank balance in PvP, and plan to make some adjustments to at least Guardian in the near future. WarcraftDevs
