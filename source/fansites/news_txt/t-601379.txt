Epix !
I've been slacking pretty badly on the BT/Hyjal loots list lately, I'll update it within the day, but while you wait let's check what's been added to Wowhead http://www.wowhead.com today !
As usual, a few drop locations are "identified" from the itemID and I could be wrong, but if it's not from the boss I listed it's probably the next/previous one anyway. I also got a new "toy" lately and may use it soon on items, wait & see. ^^
