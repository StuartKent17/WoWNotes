Zoltan - First player to reach 10,000 Achievements Points
Less than a year ago achievements were added to the game with the release of Patch 3.0. Today, Zoltan http://armory.wow-europe.com/character-achievements.xml?r=Aegwynn&cn=Zoltan&gn=Refuge Refuge http://www.refuge-guild.de/ @ EU-Aegwynn was the first player to hit 10,000 Achievement points! 

Congratulations to him, that's definitely a LOT of motivation.
