Warlords of Draenor Beta Patch Notes - July 17 Update
Racial Traits

Human

The Human Spirit has been redesigned. It now increases Versatility , scaling with character level. no longer increases Spirit by 3%, and instead now increases 2 secondary stats by an amount scaling with character level. You can choose which 2 secondary stats it increases. This has not yet been implemented.



Self-Sustainability

Hunter

Survivalist is a new passive ability learned by Survival Hunters at level 10.

Survivalist increases the Hunter's chance to Multistrike by 10%. Additionally, the Hunter gains 15% health over 10 seconds after killing a target.




Class Changes

 Death Knight

Blood Changes
Active Mitigation was a very successful design that was inspired by Death Knights' tanking style. However, it went beyond that, and Death Knights themselves were somewhat left behind in that regard. We made several changes to bring up the interactivity of Blood combat. This includes making Death Strike  cause healing based on attack power, but be affected by the new Resolve passive see Tank Vengeance  and Resolve above, which gives it the traditional increase from recent damage. Plus, Rune Tap  is being significantly improved, to become a strong Active Mitigation button. To tie those together, Blood's Mastery is being changed to affect both the size of the Blood Shield absorb, and the new Rune Shield absorb.


Rune Tap  has been redesigned. It now reduces all damage taken by 50% for 3 seconds. now grants an absorption shield equal to 30% of your missing health. It also now has 2 charges, with a 40-second recharge time.

Will of the Necropolis  has been redesigned. It now automatically triggers an immediate, free Rune Tap  when you take damage that reduces you below 30% health. This effect cannot occur more often than once every 45 seconds. now grants an immediate charge, and makes your next Rune Tap  free. However, its damage reduction buff now only lasts 4 seconds down from 8 seconds.


Miscellaneous
Conversion  was changed to cost different amounts by specialization, instead of reducing Runic Power generation differently by specialization. This way, Runic Power beyond what you spend on Conversion  is not penalized.

Conversion  no longer has an initial tick, and now costs 15 Runic Power/second for Blood, 20 Runic Power/sec for Frost, and 10 Runic Power/second for Unholy.


 Hunter

Ability Consolidation and Refinement

Chimera Shot  no longer heals the Hunter.


Marksmanship Changes
One of our new secondary stats Multistrike, is strikingly similar to the Wild Quiver Mastery for Marksmanship Hunters. To address this similarity, we replaced Wild Quiver with a new Mastery: Sniper Training. Marksmanship Hunters that favored Mastery before will want to favor Multistrike for a similar feel. For their new Mastery, we wanted to add some depth to their moment-to-moment gameplay, and compliment Critical Strike. In order to do that, we brought back the concept of Sniper Training.

We also changed the design of Chimera Shot  and fixed its name, in order to better capture the intended flavor. Finally, we added an interaction between Careful Aim  and Rapid Fire  and indirectly Aimed Shot  through a Draenor Perk, so as to add a bit more depth to their gameplay.

Chimera Shot  has been renamed Chimaera Shot. It is now a two-headed shot that hits two targets, and deals Frost or Nature damage. It no longer heals the Hunter.


Survival Changes
Apart from rotational changes through Ability Pruning, changes for Survival Hunters mostly center on Lock and Load  We changed how Lock and Load  is triggered to increase the value of Multistrike, provide gameplay depth and the ability to pool damage more. Also note the new passive ability, Survivalist, which increases multistrike chance by 10%, in order to give Survival Hunters some baseline Multistrike chance.

Survivalist is a new passive ability learned by Survival Hunters at level 10.

Survivalist increases the chance to Multistrike by 10% and the Hunter gains 15% health over 10 seconds after killing a target.



 Mage

Ability Consolidation and Refinement

Ignite now deals the same total damage with a 1 second period down from 2 seconds. Base duration changed to 5 seconds so that duration when refreshed remains 6 seconds.
