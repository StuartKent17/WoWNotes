Patch 4.2 - PTR Build 14107
A new build is being deployed on test realms.

Update
02:00AM CET - The proc for Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71086/dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest/ might be added in this build. As usual, nothing official for the moment but it's very consistent with the official preview.
Wrath of Tarecgosa http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/101056/wrath-of-tarecgosa/ - When you deal damage, you have a chance to gain the Wrath of Tarecgosa, duplicating the harmful spell.
The great staff duplicates destructive magics, and also bestows upon its wielder the ability to transform into a member of the Blue Dragonflight.

Holy Shield now increases block chance by 5% while active, instead of increasing the amount of damage blocked by 10%.
