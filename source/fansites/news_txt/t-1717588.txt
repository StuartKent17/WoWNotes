any thoughts on adding archaeology and random BOAs to heirloom tab?
It's something we can consider for a later time, but right now the system is designed for proper heirloom items. WarcraftDevs 

PvE
seems we got mythic ability in hc Blast Furnace? slagpool givin energy to boss? DJ says mythic only?
Slag Pool is used on all difficulties and affects Heart of the Mountain in phase 2. Dungeon Journal will reflect this in 6.1. WarcraftDevs 

So Sigil of the Black Hand quest, if I use it and kill Blackhand first will the rest of the instance be available?
Yes, the quest unlocks the ability to go directly to Blackhand, and you can still do the rest afterwards. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
Appreciate that folks still send bug reports to this account despite it no longer being a source of discussion about WoW. Very helpful, ty. holinka 
You're a dev who uses this twitter for WoW. Until you stop anything and everything wow from this account, deal with it
I dont use this twitter for wow. holinka 
Yeah, okay. The problem is you've used it in the past and you are the lead pvp dev... You can't just use twitter and then not
but that's what's happening. holinka 
Not offended, but that and 'not using twitter for WoW anymore' makes it a bit uncertain.
Suggestions/feedback are fine. I just won't be replying with insight from this account. holinka 

i have a question about Damping debuff in arena's, i played some with a friend after a few games we got a insta debuff, why?
In 2v2, if both teams have a healer, Dampening is applied immediately. WarcraftDevs 

 Tournament trinkets have the wrong stats. Also missing the new versatility trinket for tournament
Theyâ€™ve been updated but the new versatility trinket will not be available for tournament in 6.1. WarcraftDevs 


Computers - Setup of the Month
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolution, we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices  are trending slightly downward again over the past few months, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. 

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 4790K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions! If you are interested in Folding@home, take a look in our team's thread
