This November marks the 10-year anniversary of World of Warcraft, and we&#x2019;re cooking up a few in-game plans to commemorate the occasion. Here&#x2019;s a quick preview of what&#x2019;s in store:<br>
<br>
Tarren Mill vs. Southshore: The Rematch<br>
If you engaged in PvP early on in WoW, you might have fond memories of&#x2014;and perhaps a few scars from&#x2014;the endless tug-of-war between Horde and Alliance players at Tarren Mill and Southshore. To recapture that feeling, we&#x2019;ll be opening a Team Deathmatch&#x2013;style Battleground based on that timeless struggle. However, unlike the old days of Tarren Mill vs. Southshore, there will be a clearly defined victor, so you&#x2019;ll need to work as a team or face crushing defeat.<br>

Molten Core Gets Boosted<br>
Molten Core provided many WoW players with their first taste of WoW raiding. For the anniversary celebration, max-level players will be able to participate in a special 40-player Raid Finder version to relive the experience of hunting down Ragnaros and his minions within his fiery lair. Downing the Firelord will earn you an Achievement and a special Core Hound mount reward (fireproof leg armor not included).<br>

Corgi-licious<br>
Anyone who logs in during the 10-year anniversary event will also be able to claim a feisty, fiery new pet: the Molten Corgi! Just think of the corgi-parade potential when you and your friends summon these wee waddling balls of fire for a walk.<br>

These events and rewards will only be available for a limited time, so make sure to check back with us later for more information on when you can expect to see them in-game. &#x2018;Til then, we&#x2019;re looking forward to celebrating 10 epic years with you!</div></div>
