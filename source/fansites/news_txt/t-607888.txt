Boubouille2008-05-19, 08:45 PMFriend & Family Alpha Signup are now open
The site to signup for the Friend & Family Alpha https://beta.worldofwarcraft.com/expansion/ is available and I guess we can consider that the alpha officialy started. As a reminder this is restricted to Blizzard's employees and their friends/family and it's not public in any way, you won't get any mail related to this phase of the beta.
