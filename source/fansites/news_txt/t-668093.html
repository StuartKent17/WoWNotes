The Brood Mother Returns<br>
After years of lurking in her lair battling the many brave adventurers who travelled from afar to challenge her, Onyxia returns stronger than before to commemorate World of Warcraft&#x2019;s five-year anniversary.<br>
<br>
Onyxia has been scaled to offer new challenges to level 80 players and is now available for testing in 10- and 25-player modes.<br>
Adjusted for modern raiding, but with the fundamental experience of fighting the Brood Mother still in effect, including the horrors of her Deep Breaths!<br>
Onyxia will now drop level 80 item versions of some classic loot items from the level 60 encounter.<br>
Brood of Onyxia, a very rare 310%-speed mount modeled after Onyxia herself will be available for the luckiest of challengers.<br>
<br>

Players level 11 and higher will now always see a daily Battleground quest, as the quest giver will only offer daily quests for a Battleground in which a player is eligible to participate according to level bracket (i.e. players levels 11-20 will always be offered a Warsong Gulch daily quest, while players levels 11-50 will be offered either an Arathi Basin or a Warsong Gulch daily quest, etc.).<br>

Maximum number of Battlegrounds Queues reduced to 2 in 3.2.2<br>
All of the User Interface changes in 3.2.2 to the Battleground queuing system are to help address matches starting with uneven numbers on each team. These changes may not fully address the situation, but in that case we have some other possible solutions we can implement further down the road. <br>
<br>
From the 3.2.2 PTR Patch Notes: <br>
Players may now only queue for no more than two Battlegrounds at a time.<br>
The dialog box for entering a Battleground match has been changed to reflect the following options: &#x201C;Enter Battle,&#x201D; &#x201C;Leave Queue,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Minimize.&#x201D;<br>
The time a player has to enter a battle when selected has been reduced to 40 seconds when not already in a Battleground and 20 seconds when in a Battleground.<br>
Players already in a Battleground can now choose &#x201C;Enter Battle&#x201D; for a new Battleground under any circumstance (i.e. while dead, in combat, falling, etc.).<br>
A new Battleground will not launch until the maximum number of players on each side are in the queue (i.e. 40 players per side for Alterac Valley).<br>
<br>
Implementing Tenacity in Battlegrounds<br>
That&apos;s highly unlikely. We&apos;d rather exhaust every measure possible -- which we have not as of yet -- to get the matches even rather than just concede that it can&apos;t be done and implement something like Tenacity as a result. Tenacity can be controversial and isn&apos;t designed for instanced PvP. Besides, I doubt most players would like to see Battlegrounds arbitrarily balanced by a buff rather than by numbers of players on each team.

Next Classes Q&amp;A Series<br>
The timing of BlizzCon next to the priest Q&amp;A made conducting a short follow-up Q&amp;A difficult. With all of the recent announcements coupled with the 3.2.2 testing process, we&apos;re looking to start another round of class Q&amp;A&apos;s in the near future. We don&apos;t have a class order yet, but it shouldn&apos;t be the same as the last one. We&apos;re in the process of discussing ways of improving the Class Q&amp;A Series, looking at what worked well the first time and what didn&apos;t. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/19820873197-where-are-our-followup-questions.html))<br>

Scourge Strike vs. Obliterate in 3.2.2<br>
Scourge Strike does appropriate damage given that it ignores all armor. The problem with Obliterate, we believe, was because so many talents and glyphs propped it up more than Scourge Strike. In a PvP scenario it&apos;s pretty unlikely your target will be sundered at all, in which case Scourge Strike will generally beat Obliterate anyway.<br>
<br>
We aren&apos;t likely to bring back the gigantic DK strikes of older patches. We had huge problems with DKs being overpowered back then. The DK is supposed to have to set up those attacks and use them essentially as finishers. Yet DKs are also doing a lot of damage with their diseases and runic power attacks in addition to the two-handed strikes. All of that ignores the fact that DKs have enormous survivability and crowd control.<br>
<br>
When you aren&apos;t facing a shaman or another pro dispeller, Unholy does fine damage with Scourge Strike. We&apos;ve just seen a big rise in shaman lately in Arenas. That&apos;s ultimately a good thing, but I understand that it can feel a little like the whole Plague Strike removing hots deal in reverse. The answer is not to make Scourge Strike hit so hard that the diseases don&apos;t matter or that nothing really matters but getting really big Scourge Strike crits. <br>
<br>
[...] All of the 3.2.2 changes were just to get Unholy DKs to put down the Obliterate button, which as I&apos;ve said several times now, was a pretty big deal on these forums for a few weeks. (Which is not to say you should make a really big deal of anything you want to change.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820872699-yay--more-dk-nerfs.html))<br>

2 pieces T9 Bonus only critting for 50%<br>
Some of your points have been pretty convincing and have been taken into consideration. While this is more of a design change vs. a bug, I have found that it should in fact be a 100% critical damage multiplier. This will be corrected for 3.2.2, but may not be in a build until next week.
