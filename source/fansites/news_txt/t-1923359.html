Legion - Arcane Hippogryph Mount<br>
Legion adds a new hippogryph mount that goes nicely with Brightpaw (https://battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-pet-brightpaw) and the Mystic Runesaber (https://battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-mount-mystic-runesaber) mount. There is no spell, item, or source yet, so we can&apos;t be sure if you will be able to obtain this mount. <br>

Legion - Fel Core Hound Mount<br>
The only existing Core Hound (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/170347-core-hound) mount was a reward from the WoW 10th Anniversary celebration, but Legion adds a new Fel Core Hound. There is no spell, item, or source yet, so we can&apos;t be sure if you will be able to obtain this mount. <br>

Blue Tweets<br>
Character / Items<br>
Can you guys please add Winter&apos;s Grasp and Flames to the Stolen Present? One chance a year is nuts!<br>
.Feedback received, they will be account wide xmogs in Legion, should feel rare and special. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/678006658639855616))<br>
No changes planned for this event? Gone through 7 characters and have neither, and never got Flames from Rag :-(<br>
We will continue to monitor the feedback (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/678007586734538752))<br>

PvP<br>
what&apos;s the purpose of making people start over with prestige levels? Why not just continue gaining xp/prest after 50?<br>
We want the decision to Prestige to be optional, but not trivial. If everyone does it, it&apos;s not nearly as &quot;Prestigious.&quot; (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/677296609340723200))<br>
<br>
Stay true to the idea of a tank being hit; make Taunt give penalties for not hitting tank, such as reduced damage dealt.<br>
We don&apos;t think the fantasy of &quot;I get hit&quot; works well in PvP. Prefer to work on the &quot;I&apos;m on the front line&quot; fantasy instead. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/677564696514310144))<br>
<br>
Curious how you landed on 0.1%/ilvl. What was the target goal? Is 0.2% or 0.5%/ilvl too much?<br>
It&apos;s based on the full spectrum of item levels in the tier. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/677564898881089537))<br>
<br>
Looks fun!Will stat nullification(reallocation) activate upon entering pvp combat in open world or only in instance pvp?<br>
Only in instanced PvP. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/677565040728236032))<br>
<br>
Transmogrification<br>
Will Winter&apos;s Grasp and Flames of Ragnaros be xmogable enchants in Legion if you have them?<br>
Yep! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/677570545928433664))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
Anything that can be passed on about the &apos;Garrison Resources&apos; that MMO-champion brought up?<br>
What&apos;s been datamined for Class Order Missions is very early dev. Expect quite a few changes between Garrisons and Order Halls. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/677297688837152769))<br>
<br>
Are bodyguards going to be in Legion? Please tell me Illona is a follower, somehow, some way! I would follow HER if I could!!!<br>
Some followers will have the ability to be bodyguards, but it may function differently to what you&apos;re used to in WoD. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/677297895553372161))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Hi Greg, just wondering your thoughts; why do designers rarely make things &quot;Nintendo Hard&quot; nowadays? https://t.co/L1ILE4fcy9<br>
1) Game budgets are 1000x what they were in the NES days, so it&apos;s a big risk to have players not like your game. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/677132370491781120))<br>
2) Many games are so story based that devs and players want you to reach the end of the story. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/677132536837832705))<br>
3) The devs forget that getting better at something and finally mastering it is immensely satisfying. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/677132724268720128))<br>
