Yay! Finally! Patch 3.3 introduced a handful of new mounts and one of them is probably one of the most interesting ever added to the game : Invincible (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/72286/invincible/).<br>
<br>
Who&apos;s Invincible? Let&apos;s ask WoWWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Invincible): Invincible was the steed of Arthas Menethil, both in life and death. He was the skeletal steed that Arthas rode throughout Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne. <br>
<br>
Until a few builds ago I wasn&apos;t really sure if it was going to be a player mount or not but the addition of the Invincible&apos;s Reins (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4625/invincibles-reins/) feat of strength definitely confirmed that. <br>
<br>
We do not know where it will drop but it&apos;s safe to assume that we&apos;ll have to defeat the Lich King in some crazy-hard difficulty mode. Also keep in mind that we won&apos;t fight him before months, it also means that players won&apos;t get this mount either and it could be modified before it hits the live servers. This is just a preview.<br>

Perky Pug Companion Pet<br>
I already posted a video of Perky Pug (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/70600/perky-pug/) a few weeks ago but one of the latest PTR build added an ... interesting animation to this pet. I suggest that you watch the whole video before you decide if he&apos;s still cute. <br>

World of Warcraft Magazine<br>
The World of Warcraft Official Magazine should be coming hot off the presses in December. We hope to have them shipped out shortly thereafter. We&apos;ll be sending an email out to all subscribers in the near future with additional details. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21334015479-world-of-warcraft-magazine.html))<br>

PvP Titles in Cataclysm<br>
In Cataclysm, we plan to make the old PvP titles available based on your performance in our upcoming rated Battleground system, similar to the current Arena titles which are based on your performance in the Arenas. Keep in mind, however, that Cataclysm is still relatively early in the development stages and this information is subject to change. We&apos;ll have more on the rated Battleground system and associated rewards in the months ahead. <br>
<br>
[...] I&apos;m going to clarify my original post, as I don&apos;t believe it&apos;s been decided yet whether they&apos;ll be purchased with Arena points or Honor points, or if a specific Battleground rating is the only requirement to unlock them. There are no plans to make these titles available for real-world money. <br>
<br>
[...] We feel they&apos;re going to fit well with the new rated Battleground system. The titles were previously earned through a very cumbersome experience that didn&apos;t necessarily measure a player&apos;s PvP skill. With a new system for measuring performance in the Battlegrounds, we feel it&apos;s a good fit to award the honor titles to those who excel. We do not intend for the top titles to be earned in a trivial manner. It&apos;s going to be quite hard to get High Warlord or Grand Marshal; and not because it&apos;s going to require that someone plays in the Battlegrounds more than everyone else on their realm each week, but because it&apos;s going to require a very impressive win/loss ratio.

Rated Battlegrounds and Arena Points in Cataclysm<br>
The current plan is still for rated Battlegrounds to grant Arena points, though some rewards will require a certain rating from this system just as with the current Arena system. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21333885156-confirm-this-rumor-blue.html))<br>
