Weekly Bonus Event - Arena Skirmishes<br>
Sharpen your swords and reinforce your boards, because you&#x2019;re called to the PvP Arena for the hectic mayhem of Skirmishes.<br>
<br>
This Week: Arena Skirmishes<br>
All week, from anywhere in Azeroth, open the Group Finder (default hotkey: i), select the Player vs. Player tab on the bottom of the window, and then under Arena Battles, choose either 2v2 or 3v3 and JOIN BATTLE. You&#x2019;ll be matched up with teammates and provided with opponents to kill in the Arena.<br>
<br>
Look for the following all week long:<br>
<br>
<br>
Archmage Timear (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44172-the-arena-calls) for you.<br>
<br>

Command Center Hotfix<br>
Just to confirm, we recently applied a hotfix to change the Challenge Mission&apos;s unintentionally low reward. It now rewards 3.1 million Artifact Power at Artifact Knowledge 26.<br>
<br>
Does this count for the people who already sent their followers on the mission when it was still at the low AP value?<br>
If you sent your followers on the mission (and it hasn&apos;t completed yet) you&apos;ll receive the new, increased, amount of AP when the mission is completed.

Brewmasters in Patch 7.2.5<br>
Continuing to iterate...<br>
<br>
Special Delivery already fills the role of giving an offensive value to Brew charges, but not in a reliable way. Instead of the Purifying Brew -&gt; Breath of Fire buff, we&apos;re going to try making Special Delivery reliable. If you&apos;re the type of player that dislikes Brew charges being wasted when not tanking, Special Delivery already is attractive, and we&apos;re just going to make that feel better by being reliable. <br>
<br>
FYI, the first datamineable PTR build likely won&apos;t have this change.<br>
<br>
EDIT: &quot;Reliable&quot; meaning 100% proc chance, damage per keg reduced to compensate. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1055455-brewmasters-in-725/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753776674?page=28#559))<br>

What&apos;s current formula for bonus stats percentage in PvP? Is it still the number of ilevels above 800 ilvl times 0.1?<br>
Yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/850073803845648384))</div></div>
