Yesterday I reported a blue post made by Hortus explaining that under specific timing circumstances, Cheat Death will sometimes reduce damage by 99% instead of 90%. It&apos;s not as bad as it look and it only affects the spell triggering Cheat Death, this is NOT 4 seconds of invulnerability for rogues.<br>
When two spells land with exact timing activating cheat death the spells can receive 99% reduction instead of 90%. In the past when this happened the spells were not affected by Cheat Death at all.<br>
<br>
This only affects the spells triggering cheat death and not subsequent spells and only happens under very specific circumstances which can not be purposely exploited. It does not give rogues &quot;4 seconds of invulnerability&quot; as some people have said.<br>
<br>
<br>
Vendors in Boats and Zeppelins<br>
They were supposed to be back in 2.3.2, and in 2.3.3, and they&apos;re still missing. It looks like fixing the bug is harder than expected and Blizzard can&apos;t give any ETA for a fix.<br>
We had planned to get them back in recently, however, there were some issues of boats and zeppelins not functioning properly, so they were removed. While we&apos;d still love to be able to get them back on duty, there is no definite eta on when or if this will happen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Other bugs<br>
Hortus answered on a few posts about other bugs too, let&apos;s hope that none of them will postpone the 2.4 to apply a minor patch once again. <br>
Rogue Stealth/Vanish breaking bug (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif)<br>
The issue with Stealth and Vanish breaking 5 seconds after sapping or breaking stealth has been hotfixed last night, It may not take effect until individual realms are restarted. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4071474405&amp;postId=41194685127&amp;sid=1#74))<br>

Eye of the Storm matches freeze and finish early on some Battlegroups<br>
We are aware of the issues with Eye of the Storm Battleground on some battle groups, it is being investigated. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4064465255&amp;postId=41194683709&amp;sid=1#8))<br>
<br>
Haste effects do not apply the correct amount of casting/attack increase<br>
Example: 20% haste only increases cast speed by 17% <br>
The formula for haste effects is:<br>
NEW_SPEED = OLD_SPEED / (1 + HASTE_PERCENT)<br>
This can be a bit confusing, but it assures that no amount of +haste effects will result in zero or negative attack or cast speed. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4068015736&amp;postId=41194684365&amp;sid=1#3))<br>

<br>
French and German realms are getting free migrations as well. (German post (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=2405524474&amp;sid=3), French post (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=2405524108&amp;sid=2))<br>
Due to population differences between some of the highest and lowest populated PvP realms, the following Free Character Migration will be available January 23rd to 29th:<br>
<br>
From: Drak&apos;thul, Kazzak, Stormreaver, Sylvanas, Twilight&apos;s Hammer<br>
