Update: For Azeroth! Event Temporarily Returns

Our recent “For Azeroth!” in-game event that concluded on Tuesday, March 14, came to an end a few hours earlier than we told you it would. As a result, a number of players who were still racing to unlock their mounts weren’t able to finish the quest in time, and we’d like to make it up to you. We’ve decided to extend the quest by a few days so that everyone has time to complete their games and claim their rewards.

We’ve re-enabled the “For Azeroth!” event quest starting today, March 17, through Sunday, March 26. Any progress you earned prior to the quest’s original March 14 end-date will remain intact.
