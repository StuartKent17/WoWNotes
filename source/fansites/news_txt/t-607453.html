Official forums avatars &amp; rogues<br>
Woops! I meant T5, but yeah rogues are in T4, maybe the web artists thought T5 was too dark/bland to set the icons apart. In any case your armory is a click away so I wouldn&apos;t worry about a forum icon too much. Before Lich King comes out I&apos;m betting there will be new icons for level 80 and everyone will be in Tier 7. We have no plans to update the icons before that time.
