7.3 PTR Build Deploy - 8/8/2017
Greetings friends!

We'll be pushing a new 7.3.0 build to PTR this morning and will need to bring realms down to do so. No ETA for today's push but I'll ping this thread if things look like they're going to take longer than usual ~4-6 hours. 

As always this thread will remain open for discussion, so long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines. 

Thanks for your patience everyone!


Patch 7.3 - Netherlight Crucible Requirements
One quick update for now, based on some discussions that came up after this was posted on Friday:

Q: What are the requirements to access the Netherlight Crucible?
A: Our intent at this stage of development is for there to only be two requirements: your character is level 110, and you have the account-wide achievement "Now You're Cooking With Netherlight." That achievement is given as part of the final chapters of the 7.3 story campaign, which is planned to open week 3 of the patch so 15 days after release.

We've been able to isolate a couple of bugs - partly due to responses to this thread, so thank you! - that are currently on the PTR preventing access to the Netherlight Crucible unless you have a rank in Concordance of the Legionfall. That's an unintended restriction, which we're working on fixing for a future PTR update.


Weekly Bonus Event - Battlegrounds
A new weekly quest and rewards are here—steel yourself for Battleground combat!

Seven Days on the Battlegrounds
All this week, heading to the Battlegrounds will net you some extra Honor along with bonus loot for completing this week’s quest. To enter the fray, open Group Finder default hotkey: I and then select the Player vs. Player tab. Next choose Casual, select Random Battlegrounds, and hit the Join Battle button—you’ll be matched up with other players and sent to one of the 11 battlegrounds.

Weekly Quest
Before you get started, Archmage Timear  near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest for you  Win four random Battlegrounds, and you’ll be rewarded with 5 Marks of Honor, a Badge of Honor 1000 Honor, and a Glory of the Melee Artifact Power token base 500 AP.

Battleground Buff
This week you gain 50% more Honor in Battlegrounds.

A New Event Every Week
The Bonus Events system consists of a rotating schedule of different activities, currently scheduled to run each week beginning on Tuesdays. Each Bonus Event grants a passive bonus to a particular game activity and offers a once-per-event quest with a noteworthy reward for accomplishing a related goal. The in-game calendar can serve as your one-stop reference for the event schedule. The Adventure Guide also offers a direct link to active Bonus Events, allowing you to easily accept any associated quests.

Defy the law of gravity in this week’s PvP Brawl: Gravity Lapse - August 8-15! 

Every other week, a new PvP Brawl will be available to players looking for something just a little different. Each Brawl will offer a variety of modes, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay, and you’ll find them in the Group Finder tool hotkey “I” in the Player vs. Player tab. Just like Random Battlegrounds, you’ll receive a reward for achieving victory. Here are just a few of the Brawls you can look forward to:

Gravity Lapse: August 8-15


  

Gravity getting you down? Step into the Eye of the Storm and be prepared for a whole new en-lighten-ing experience. Every minute, players on the battlefield will find themselves launched into the air, only to gently fall toward the ground again in a perpetual aerial ballet as they try to accrue enough resources to take the win home for their team.
