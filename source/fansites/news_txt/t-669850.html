The Brood Mother Returns<br>
After years of lurking in her lair battling the many brave adventurers who travelled from afar to challenge her, Onyxia returns stronger than before to commemorate World of Warcraft&#x2019;s five-year anniversary.<br>
<br>
Onyxia has been scaled to offer new challenges to level 80 players and is now available for testing in 10- and 25-player modes.<br>
Adjusted for modern raiding, but with the fundamental experience of fighting the Brood Mother still in effect, including the horrors of her Deep Breaths!<br>
Onyxia will now drop level 80 item versions of some classic loot items from the level 60 encounter.<br>
Brood of Onyxia, a very rare 310%-speed mount modeled after Onyxia herself will be available for the luckiest of challengers.<br>
<br>

Battlegrounds<br>
Players level 11 and higher will now always see a daily Battleground quest, as the quest giver will only offer daily quests for a Battleground in which a player is eligible to participate according to level bracket (i.e. players levels 11-20 will always be offered a Warsong Gulch daily quest, while players levels 11-50 will be offered either an Arathi Basin or a Warsong Gulch daily quest, etc.).<br>
