A hotfix has been deployed that prevents Linking a Poison Recipe or Hunter Pet Ability in a chat message from causing a disconnect<br>
A Hotfix was deployed that prevents Seer Olum from despawning too quickly after being rescued from the serpent shrine.<br>
A Hotfix has been applied that prevents Coilfang Ambushers from being charmed.<br>
A Hotfix has been applied that keeps the lurker in the water until all of the adds are dead.<br>
A Hotfix has been applied that changes Gruul&apos;s hateful strike target to the 2nd highest on the threat list instead of the 3rd highest.<br>
A Hotfix has been applied that respawns the gem vendors in Thrallmar and Honor hold.<br>

Darkmoon Faire Cards<br>
It seems that the [Ace of Furies], [Ace of Lunacy], [Ace of Storms], and [Ace of Blessings] can drop from any boss in normal and heroic mode instances. What we know so far from the Darkmoon Faire trinkets is from the PTR :<br>
Vengeance (Storms)<br>
+51 Stamina<br>
You have a 10% chance when hit by an attack or harmful spell to deal 95 to 115 holy damage to your attacker.<br>
Wrath (Furies)<br>
Each time one of your direct damage attacks does not critically strike, you gain 17 critical strike rating and 17 spell critical strike rating for the next 10 sec. This effect is consumed when you deal a critical strike. (Stacks up to 20 times)<br>
Crusade (Blessings)<br>
Each time you deal melee damage to an opponent, you gain 6 attack power for the next 10 sec., stacking up to 20 times. Each time you land a harmful spell on an opponent, you gain 8 spell damage for the next 10 sec., stacking up to 10 times.<br>
Madness (Lunacy)<br>
+51 Stamina<br>
Each time you land a killing blow on an enemy, you gain the Power of Madness. (Duration: 30 Seconds)<br>
<br>
Power of Madness list :<br>
Delusional: +70 Attack Power<br>
Dimentia: &quot;Down the rabbit hole...&quot; Every 5 seconds either gives you +5% or -5% Damage/Healing.<br>
