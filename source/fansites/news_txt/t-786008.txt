Boubouille2010-11-05, 06:37 PMThe new version of MMO-Champion is live!
It's been a long time since the last major change on the site, the current theme is now 3 years old and it's time to replace it with something a little nicer and a lot more useful! The new website has a couple of interesting additions that should make your life easier. 



A feed of the latest Blue Posts is finally available on the front page! 
The left menu is gone, news posts can now use the full width of the page. It will mostly allows me to post more information when I have to use tables, lot of pictures, etc ... 
Patch menus have been moved to the top right of the site. 
The forums  are much, much, much, much better. You can now go through a couple of posts 
Overall, the site is much nicer and is a lot more polished than the previous theme. 



 


Now that the Blue Tracker  is integrated to the website, we also updated it to match the new theme and added a couple of features.



Support of Battle.net forums in the future, we shouldn't have any downtime when the new WoW site is launched.
Support of Spanish  and French  language.
Addition of boxes with Recent News and Recent Forum posts from MMO-Champion.
Cleaned up categories, you can now click the name of a Blue Poster for his post history, etc ...
