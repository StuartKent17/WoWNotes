chaud2017-05-24, 12:47 AMPatch 7.2.5 PTR - Build 24163
Hi everyone! There’s a few things to call out for this PTR update:

First, we’re continuing iteration on 7.2.5 class changes, and this build has some pretty substantial changes for a couple of specs. Arms Warriors in particular have a lot of updates and revisions, and both Marksmanship and Beast Mastery Hunters have several changes to their Honor Talents.

We’re also continuing to iterate on Tier 20 set bonuses, and have added several new Legendary items in this build. Once the PTR is up or shortly thereafter, you should be able to find the new Legendaries on Flaskataur in Dalaran if you’d like to give them a try.

We’ve turned on the Darkmoon Faire for this week as there’s a new band in town! The concert event starts every hour on the half hour. We’d like to get some testing and feedback, so please let us know what you think!

This build also has a tweak to Mythic Keystone difficulty. Specifically, the amount of health and damage that enemy creatures get from each additional difficulty level is increasing from 8% health and damage to 10% per keystone level. When we increased the overall difficulty of Mythic+ dungeons in 7.2, we didn't fully account for the increase in power that players would get from their new Artifact Traits. That hasn't been a major problem just yet, but once the Tomb of Sargeras raid opens and the maximum item level from drops increases, everyone’s going to get a LOT stronger in a hurry, which will quickly compound the issue. We're making this change to ensure that things don’t get too out of hand at the top end of the spectrum.

Lastly, we’d like to do another Skirmish with the Blues this week to gather some data on where PvP balance currently sits on the PTR to assist with PvP tuning. We’re scheduling this for Friday, May 26 from 2 PM to 4 PM Pacific time 5 PM to 7 PM Eastern. Any data we can get at this stage will be extremely helpful, so we hope you’ll join us.

Thanks again everyone, and happy testing!


Raid Testing Schedule - May 25-26
On Thursday and Friday, May 25-26, we will be conducting Mythic raid testing of Tomb of Sargeras bosses.

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.
