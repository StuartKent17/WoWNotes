Armory Stats - Challenge Modes
Today we are taking a look at the Challenge Mode achievement completion rate of players. The data used today is a sample of 2.1 million characters active in the last two months. We also did this earlier this year, which you can see here  

The first chart looks at the overall percentage of players that have each challenge mode achievement. The second chart defines a participating player as one with the completion achievement for that challenge mode. 

You can click the titles in the legend to turn off and on different data types.


Challenge Warlord  - 3.03% of players
Challenge Warlord: Bronze  - 2.87% of players / 94.52% of participating players
Challenge Warlord: Silver  - 2.72% of players / 89.8% of participating players
Challenge Warlord: Gold  - 2.49% of players / 81.92% of participating players

In Legion, are we still going to fill our bags with "Tome of the Clear Mind" in order to change our talents?
Nope! No reagents are needed to swap talents in Legion. WarcraftDevs 

with the inclusion of gnome hunters, does this mean we can expect other new race/class combos?
We have no other additional race/class combos planned for Legion at this time. WarcraftDevs 

If base spells change for all classes, will learning order and speed we learn them change too?
Yes, the levels at which you learn each ability will be adjusted. WarcraftDevs 

Is leveling to110 as restore shaman going to be just using lightning bolt since we have no maelstrom power?
Nope! We're adding more engaging damage-dealing rotations for all healers in Legion. WarcraftDevs 

any plans on HP changes for Legion?
HP pools turned out fairly well in Warlords. No wide-scale changes for Legion. Couple specs may go up or down. WarcraftDevs 
How is it acceptable to have one level 100 player with barely 200k hp, and another with well over 500k?
What issue do you see there? There are different forms of content targeting those players. Celestalon 

Do Moonkins and Spriests keep their in-form healing in Legion? Clarification due to the "no mana".
They will have some healing. We're still determining exactly what. Moonkin still have mana, it just isn't used for damage. WarcraftDevs 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
this makes me sad. The presences aren't "just clutter" they have utility with movement speed and BP has saved many wipes.
There will still be ways to save wipes, and a variety of utility. WarcraftDevs 

Hey, could u explain Marrowrend? Does it automatically activate Bone Shield working like SotR or can we manually use stacks?
Using Marrowrend gives you 3 stacks of Bone Shield, which work as they do now. Bone Shield isn't an active button of its own. WarcraftDevs 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
What will happen to Bloodtalons for Ferals? Will it remain a talent or something else?
Bloodtalons works well as a high-risk, high-reward talent, and is remaining. WarcraftDevs 

So rejuvenate cant be used in feral.. Does this applies to all specs besides Resto & as a feral what will be the way to heal?
Still determining what heals can be used in forms. Ferals do still have the very strong Predatory Swiftness + Healing Touch. WarcraftDevs 

will the feral druid legendary overwrite the saberon appearance from the talent or will saberon appearance be customized too?
We've opted to remove the Saberon form, for now. Artifacts provide a huge amount of customizability for forms. WarcraftDevs 

If feral or guardian druids transmog their artifacts, will their bear and cat form go back to basic, or be the form selected?
It will remain as the artifact-based form. WarcraftDevs 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Run of Power & Incanter's Flow. Can we please go into #Legion without these? Would mean an awful lot to many mages if removed.
Rune of Power isn't for everyone, but pretty flexible nowadays. Incanter's Flow is a passive option for those who prefer it. WarcraftDevs 

will Ice Barrier be stronger in Legion for mages?
It's hard to measure exactly, since so much changes between expansions, but in general terms, yes. WarcraftDevs 

Every other class can self heal, how does it appropriately fit with every other class fantasy except mages?
Absorbs such as Ice Barrier fill the same role instead. WarcraftDevs 
Can do harder content with worse gear on classes that I don't know as well vs mage with absorb. Any plans to improve absorbs?
Not every class is designed to be a master of sustainability. Mages are somewhere in the middle. Ice Barrier will be quite strong. WarcraftDevs 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
SCK having a chi req.. so it's no longer spammable and can't be used without first selecting a target and generating a chi?
We chose to turn SCK into a spender, so that its damage could be strong. It will not require a target. WarcraftDevs 

is Touch of Death staying around? it's pretty iconic to monks.
Touch of Death is remaining, but it works rather differently. It's more of a cooldown than an execute. WarcraftDevs 

I need clarification on storm-earth-fire,Will us the main character deal 100% of the damage while both clone deal 50% damage?
No. All three, including you, will deal 50% damage. It's not for use on one or two targets. WarcraftDevs 

will we see Chi Explosion in Legion in a new form now that chi is gone? It's one of my favorite spells!
Chi Explosion disagreed with the fantasy quite a bit, and was extremely complex. Instead, we're adding other alternatives. WarcraftDevs 

With fistweaving gone how will mistweavers do damage?
Mistweavers still have a few melee combat abilities for dealing damage. They just won't also cause healing. WarcraftDevs 

With their mastery changing, will Mistweaver monks still create healing spheres?
There will be no more Healing Spheres as a baseline. We may add them as a PvP talent, however. WarcraftDevs 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Will paladins still have seals in Legion or are they a thing in the past?
While they've been around forever, they haven't delivered on gameplay, so Seals will be a thing of the past. WarcraftDevs 

the changes to hammer of the righteous and consecration interaction effect single target damage whether consecration is down?
Yes, they do. Consecration is still worth using, even on a single target. WarcraftDevs 

With holy gone for tankadins. What's replacing it? Mana?
Gameplay-wise, Protection Paladins will treat uses of Shield of the Righteous similar to how they treated Holy Power. WarcraftDevs 
They'll still have a mana bar, which is only used for healing others and utility. WarcraftDevs 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Do Void- and Mind Blast share CD? Or can i enter Voidform with MB, and then cast VB immediately?
We're still iterating on the Shadow rotation, and looking to further differentiate gameplay in/out of Voidform. Stay tuned. WarcraftDevs 

is shadow word: death gone for spreists? it was so important for pvp tbh, will be really sad if it is gone.
Currently, it remains, as the only true execute ability other than Execute. WarcraftDevs 

With the Shadow Priest changes in Legion, will the way Clarity of Power be changing?
The new rotation is significantly different, so most talents have to be rethought. WarcraftDevs 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
The positioning window stuff will be interesting. Is "behind" a 90 or 180 degree arc?
Backstab is very generous. Anywhere in the rear 270 degrees counts back and sides. WarcraftDevs 

Shadowstrike... merging Ambush & Shadowstep... Is Shadowstep gone in Legion? Favourite sub ability next to SDance.
Shadowstrike is a merge between Ambush and Shadowstep, and replaces both. WarcraftDevs 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
is Charred Remains gone for Destruction warlocks? Please let it be gone!!And is there any hope for fel flame? Pls answer both
Definitely gone. It turned out very un-fun. Many Warlock talents are changing, and we're looking forward to feedback on them! WarcraftDevs 

is anything being done to address affliction warlocks aoe dps issues?
Yes. Multidotting will be strong again, and Seed will be strong, especially with a talent that allows AoE application of Seed. WarcraftDevs 

How will Soul Swap work in Legion, it's really bad in WoD. Perhaps no cost with a CD ??
Soul Swap will not be returning. However, there's a new talent, Soul Effigy, that may interest you... WarcraftDevs 

I noticed Rain of Fire isn't listed as an ability in the Destruction preview. Will it still exist in Legion?
RoF and FnB overlapped too much in Warlords, which is why we hotfixed RoF out of the picture until we could revise. WarcraftDevs 
In Legion, RoF is the primary AoE, and FnB is a talent which doesn't obsolete RoF. WarcraftDevs 

What weapon-type is the demo warlock artifact?
It's a very unique artifact. We're still determining exactly how it will work for e.g. transmogrification. WarcraftDevs 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Do y'all know if Fury's new rage dump, Rampage, will have its duration scale with Haste like Fists of Fury?
Haste will reduce the GCD of Rampage, along with other rotational abilities. WarcraftDevs 

In Legion, if I DS Fury & Arms, will I be able to equip Arms Artifact as Fury & Vice Versa or will the artifact itself change?
Artifacts do not swap with your spec, and are only equippable by the appropriate spec. WarcraftDevs 

Character / Items
is supreme lord Kazzak gear able to be upgraded with the new valor system?
Yep! Enjoy those item level 715 Marks of Supreme Dooooooom! WarcraftDevs 

items containing multistrike will changes with Legion?Do we have to look for new equipment if we're multistrikebased spec?
Multistrike will be replaced with other useful stats. WarcraftDevs 

PvE
the unhotfix of the 2nd boss of grimrail intentional or getting rehotfixed for Cms?
Unintended. We'll restore the pre-patch behavior. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
and then bigger rewards like mounts/titles could be at the end of every 6-8 months or whatever of mini seasons
Glad to hear people like the idea of shorter seasons. Hopefully we'll have more to share about Legion PvP soon. holinka 

With the new PvP scaling system in #Legion will managing multiple characters finally be doable? @WarcraftDevs
The fact that some players want to play many characters while others only want to play one is a very challenging design problem. holinka 

Pets and Pet Battles
Will we hear about Pet Battle news for #Legion at some point ?? I know there aren't a lot of us, but we're loyal!
Not quite ready to talk about that yet, stay tuned Muffinus
