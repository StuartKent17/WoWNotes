In order to better balance the cost of new rewards that we would like to add to the Argent Tournament, we will be changing the cost of the Argent Hippogryph flying mount in the next minor patch. These mounts will be reduced in cost from 250 Champion’s Seals to 150 Champion’s Seals. Further details regarding additional new rewards will be provided in the future.

A display issue may occur with this change, causing the Argent Hippogryph to continue to display a cost of 250 Champion’s Seals. This display issue will be resolved in a future patch. 

Hodir - Flash Freeze Hotfix
A hotfix for this issue has been deployed. Hodir Hard Mode raiders rejoice! The casting of Flash Freeze will no longer interfere with the hard mode reward timer in this encounter.

The vehicles in the Flame Leviathan encounter will now respawn faster.
Hodir will no longer shatter his Rare Cache of Winter if defeated while casting a spell, like Flash Freeze.

Armor Penetration Potential Changes
We are now considering capping armor penetration at 100%. Armor could no longer go negative. We're not sure if we would do this in a hotfix or in 3.1.2. We just wanted to let anyone know who is furiously trying to acquire every armor pen item in the game.

Note that there is not a not a cap on the amount of armor that can be reduced in WoW at the moment. Also note that capping armor penetration at 100% does not mean that you can always reduce every target's armor to 0%. The tooltip says "up to" for a reason.

Yes, we understand this stat can be a little confusing.
