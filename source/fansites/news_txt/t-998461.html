<br>
PTR Raid Testing Schedule - Oct 14<br>
Super short notice but it looks like we&apos;ll get to see the Dragon Soul raid today!! Post stream links and screenshots in comments!<br>
<br>
And so it begins...<br>
<br>
Today we&apos;re going to try and test a couple of the initial bosses in Dragon Soul.<br>
<br>
14:30 PDT - Morchok (10 Player)<br>
16:30 PDT - Yor&apos;sahj the Unsleeping (10 Player)<br>
<br>
There will be additional testing scheduled in the upcoming weeks, both in the morning and afternoon.<br>
<br>
As always, the scheduling for PTR testing will be VERY fluid. Tests can be announced, canceled, or rescheduled at a moment&apos;s notice depending on build and server status, outstanding bugs, etc. I will try to give as much advance notice about tests, but that is not always possible. Also note that these encounters are all works in progress. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Morchok<br>
<br>
Morchok<br>
The most powerful elemental still under Deathwing&apos;s sway, Morchok-once a passive guardian-is now convinced that his only respite will come with Azeroth&apos;s demise. Morchok rages against the foundation of Wyrmrest Temple, Azeroth&apos;s last beacon of hope in the Hour of Twilight.<br>
<br>
Stomp<br>
Morchok performs a massive stomp, splitting 750000 damage between all players within 30 yards. The two closest targets take a double share of the damage. In Heroic Difficulty Stomp also increases the Physical damage taken by affected players by 50% for 20 sec.<br>
<br>
&lt;img src=&quot;http://urbad.net/tmp/icons/tank.png&quot; /&gt; Crush Armor<br>
Morchok strikes his current target, inflicting 120% normal melee damage and reducing the target&apos;s armor by 10% for 20 sec. This effect stacks up to 10 times.<br>
<br>
&lt;img src=&quot;http://urbad.net/tmp/icons/deadly.png&quot; /&gt; Resonating Crystal<br>
Morchok conjures an explosive crystal onto the battlefield that explodes after 12 sec. for massive Shadow damage. The explosion splits the damage between the three closest enemies, and the total damage inflicted increases depending on the distance of each player from the crystal. In 25 Player raids, the damage splits between the five closest enemies.<br>
<br>
Furious<br>
At 20% remaining health, Morchok becomes furious and increases his attack speed by 50% and his damage inflicted by 20%.<br>
<br>
&lt;img src=&quot;http://urbad.net/tmp/icons/important.png&quot; /&gt; The Earth Consumes You!<br>
Morchok uses the power of the earth to draw all players to him, inflicting 50% of their total health as Physical damage. While the power of the earth draws the players to him, Morchok also summons Earth&apos;s Vengeance.<br>
<br>
<br>
Earth&apos;s Vengeance (&apos;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/103178/earths-vengeance/&apos;) - Shards of Earth&apos;s Vengeance erupt from the ground, inflicting 15000 Physical damage to nearby players within 2 yards and leaving behind obstacles.<br>
Black Blood of the Earth (&apos;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/103785/black-blood-of-the-earth/&apos;) - Morchok causes the Black Blood the Earth to erupt outwards from him, inflicting 5000 Nature damage and increasing Nature damage taken by 100% every sec. while a player stands within the blood. This effect stacks up to 20 times.<br>
<br>
&lt;img src=&quot;http://urbad.net/tmp/icons/heroic.png&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://urbad.net/tmp/icons/important.png&quot; /&gt; Even Morchok<br>
Upon reaching 90% health, Morchok tears himself in half, creating his twin, Even Morchok. His twin will do the same spells Morchok performs, a few seconds later.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yor&apos;sahj the Unsleeping<br>
<br>
Yor&apos;sahj the Unsleeping<br>
Since the fall of the Bastion of Twilight, Yor&apos;sahj the Unsleeping has eagerly assisted Deathwing, providing the Destroyer with the means to release more faceless ones from their prisons deep beneath the earth. Their numbers are endless and their power is beyond reckoning, and Yor&apos;sahj intends to reap a grim reward for his faithful service.<br>
<br>
Void Bolt<br>
Soulflayer Yor&apos;sahj blasts his primary target with dark energy, dealing 90000 Shadow damage and reducing the amount of healing they take by 10%.<br>
<br>
&lt;img src=&quot;http://urbad.net/tmp/icons/important.png&quot; /&gt; Call Blood of Shu&apos;ma<br>
Soulflayer Yor&apos;sahj calls to the might of Shu&apos;mas, summoning three differently colored globules of his blood. These globules path slowly towards Yor&apos;sahj, infusing him with additional powers if they reach him. In Heroic difficulty four slimes answer Yor&apos;sahj&apos;s call.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fusing Vapors (&apos;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/103635/fusing-vapors/&apos;) - The blood globules emit a vapor that fuses with all other nearby globules when attacked. The vapor heals the nearby globules for 5% of their maximum life.<br>
<br>
When one globule dies, the surviving globules completely fuse and gain immunity to all forms of damage.<br>
Glowing Globule - When a Glowing Globule reaches Yor&apos;sahj, it infuses Yor&apos;sahj with the Glowing Blood of the Shu&apos;ma.<br>
<br>
Glowing Blood of Shu&apos;ma (&apos;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/104901/glowing-blood-of-shuma/&apos;) - Yor&apos;sahj&apos;s Void Bolt now hits all nearby targets instead of one, Yor&apos;sahj uses his abilities twice as often, and his attack speed increases by 50%.<br>
<br>
Cobalt Globule - When a Cobalt Globule reaches Yor&apos;sahj, it infuses Yor&apos;sahj with the ability to summon Mana Voids.<br>
<br>
Mana Void (&apos;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/105539/mana-void/&apos;) - A Mana Void leeches all the mana from every ranged spell caster and healer, storing the mana within itself. Destroying the Mana Void evenly returns the total of the leeched mana via Mana Diffusion to players within 18 yards.<br>
<br>
Crimson Globule - When a Crimson Globule reaches Yor&apos;sahj, it infuses Yor&apos;sahj with the Searing Blood ability.<br>
<br>
Searing Blood (&apos;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/108363/searing-blood/&apos;) - Yor&apos;sahj sears the blood of three random players, inflicting a base of 35000 Fire damage. The further the target stands from Yor&apos;sahj, the greater shock received from the blast. In 25 player raids, Yor&apos;sahj sears the blood of eight random players.<br>
<br>
Dark Globule - When a Dark Globule reaches Yor&apos;sahj, the corruption of the blood seeps out into the Mouth of Shu&apos;ma. This vile corruption then periodically creates Forgotten Ones that attack the players.<br>
<br>
Forgotten One - These creatures fixate on a random target.<br>
<br>
Psychic Slice (&apos;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/108355/psychic-slice/&apos;) - The Forgotten One emits a wave of psychic force at its current target, inflicting 44000 Shadow damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acidic Globule - When an Acidic Globule reaches Yor&apos;sahj, the mouth of Shu&apos;ma infuses with the acidic blood and stimulates further Digestive Acid production.<br>
<br>
Digestive Acid (&apos;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/105573/digestive-acid/&apos;) - Digestive Acid periodically secretes from the stomach lining, inflicting 60000 Nature damage to a player and nearby allies within 4 yards.<br>
<br>
Shadowed Globule - When a Shadowed Globule reaches Yor&apos;sahj, it infuses Yor&apos;sahj with the Deep Corruption ability.<br>
<br>
Deep Corruption (&apos;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/105173/deep-corruption/&apos;) - Yor&apos;sahj&apos;s Deep Corruption spreads to every player, causing every fifth healing or absorbtion effect cast on a player to trigger a violent detonation, inflicting 50000 Shadow damage to all players.</div></div>
