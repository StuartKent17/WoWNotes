Boubouille2007-10-10, 04:57 AMPatch 2.2.3 is being deployed in Europe, 2.3 isn't on PTRs yet, blue posts aren't really interesting, and there isn't any WotLK Beta. I heard a lot of mails were sent again yesterday, they're fake and you will end up losing your account. There was a few changes to the item tooltips code on the site, if you can't see the tooltip on this : [item=35001] please report in comments the icon is missing on purpose. Stay tuned for the 2.3.

Patch Mirrors
As usual, I downloaded the patch from the downloader and it should be fairly safe, but of course you should use Blizzard Downloader if you think it's safer.

Caster meta-gem in 2.3
The new caster metagem will increase the spell critical rating by 12 and the critical strike damage by 3%. Keep in mind that it still can change.

Engineering flying mount upgradeable
You will have to buy the normal flying mount before you can upgrade it to epic, and it will look great.
You'll first have to create the non-epic, and then upgrade it to the epic version. I think we planned the mats to be around 500g in total once you complete the epic version, but I could be wrong on that. It's worth it though. I wish I had an engineer after getting to see it. Hands down, in my opinion, the best flying mount in the game.

2.3 PTR Wars : A New Hope
The 2.2.3 PTR is now closed, thank you all for participating. We will be preparing for the 2.3 PTR soon, an announcement will be made when it starts.

Until then you should all delete your wowtest folder from within the World of Warcraft directory to assure that you have no problems with the new client.

Something to replace the old Dalaran ?
At least it shouldn't change too much, Kirin Tor is still in charge. This was in a fairly humoristic post though, but it's not like it gives tons of information
The land that Dalaran currently resides on is still claimed by the Kirin Tor and they have announced that it is not for sale.

No other zones revamped
Dustwallow Marsh is the only one for the moment, I guess it will be enough to help with the leveling.
Hrm, I believe there may have been mention of a few other zones we would like to look at polishing up, but for now we have no announced plans for future zone revisions outside of Dustwallow Marsh in 2.3.

Gnomeregan on the list too
Gnomeregan level range has been retuned too, but by now I think we all understood that they retuned every single Pre-BC dungeon.
If by "fix" you mean refocusing the dungeon to fit a smaller level range like the example we gave for Shadowfang Keep, then yes, Gnomeregan is on the list too.
