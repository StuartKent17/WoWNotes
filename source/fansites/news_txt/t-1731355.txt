Bug Fixes

Fixed an issue where Character Boosting a Protection Paladin was not granting Cold Weather Flying.



Rolling on Spirit and Bonus Armor Gear
Both Spirit and Bonus Armor are intended to help restrict the number of people in a given raid who may be interested in a particular item. The OP makes a perfect argument as to why we want that distinction: he wanted the Blackiron Micro Crucible, but had resigned himself to only really having a shot at it from a bonus roll or a cache as there were so many others in his raid group who wanted it too. That's a crappy situation.

Bonus Armor is currently working well for creating that distinction. DPS specializations don't get anything from it, but it's far and away the best stat for tanks -- so much so that tanks will nearly always prefer an item that grants Bonus Armor over an item that doesn't, even if the item with no Bonus Armor is much higher in item level. 

Prior to 6.1, we were getting a ton of feedback from tanks who were extremely disappointed to receive trinkets, rings, etc. with no Bonus Armor through their bonus rolls. It felt like a waste of a seal or cache to get something that your loot spec would realistically never equip. Plus, it's a bit of a false lead for inexperienced players; if Blizzard gave me a higher item level crit/multistrike amulet via bonus rolls, it must be an upgrade, right?

We got similar feedback from many healers, which caused us to take a look at how Spirit was functioning. Ultimately, we want Spirit to work similarly: a stat that's so good, you want it everywhere you can get it. If that's not the case for you, we'd like to fix that by making Spirit more attractive, not by making you want to equip non-Spirit items and fight with half your raid over them.

We made some changes along those lines in 6.1 such as the Mistweaver changes to Mana Tea. We feel that, with those changes, we're now in a position now where healers should always prefer Spirit pieces in the ring, neck, and back slots. The nature of trinkets makes them a little less cut-and-dry: in the vast majority of situations, you should prefer the Spirit trinket, but there could conceivably be a situation in which a DPS trinket would give better performance. We're still discussing what if any changes would need to be made to prevent those niche occurrences, but again, our goal is that you don't want the DPS trinkets.

Unfortunately Lore that is not always how stat optimization works. I'll take a dps haste trinket over spirit any day for the purpose it serves me, but removing my ability to bonus roll on said item drastically hurts my gearing process.
If that's the case, then our fix would be to either make the Spirit trinket better or the DPS trinket worse for healers. We don't want DPS and healers fighting over the same trinkets.

Arena Skirmish Healer Spec Bug
There is indeed a bug with skirmish queues at the moment that's causing healers to be forced into DPS specs. We've got a hotfix on the way for it, but it won't take effect until server restarts which currently aren't planned until normal maintenance time.

Legendary Follower Abilities
I am not sure if they were trolls but apparently thie "Legendary" follower only has 2 abilities and 3 traits like an epic.
Ultimately, adding another ability didn’t feel Legendary to us especially given that most players have solid ability coverage across their existing group of followers. Instead, we put the extra “Legendary” into a trait that acts like an ability that can counter anything. This felt awesome and like the right direction to take Legendary followers.

Legacy Content Gold Changes
Historically "escort" and "breadcrumb" type quests that just ask you to talk to an NPC have always given little or no gold. There was no intended change here, and I believe that no change occurred. It's possible that there's a subtle bug, but numerous posters in this thread seem to report that gold rewards from quests while leveling are in fact unchanged. If there are specific examples of quests that used to award gold, but which no longer do, we'd be interested in hearing about them here, or on our Bug Report forum.

Gold from questing is an essential source of gold for leveling and max-level players alike, and not something we would suddenly and wordlessly remove or reduce.

If someone could provide screenshots of specific item nerfs, this would be helpful. Since they are saying no nerfs are intentional, it is beneficial to show them the nerfs that are in place so they can reverse them ASAP.
That's a separate issue from quest gold, which was not changed at all to my knowledge. Several legacy items old epic gems, and crafting reagents like Crusader Orbs, Chaos Orbs, Sulfuron Ingots, etc. were significantly reduced in vendor value in order to limit the impact of an exploit. These items honestly don't constitute a very large portion of total gold earnings from running old raids and dungeons, compared to boss gold drops and vendored weapons and armor. Because the change was exploit-oriented, it was excluded from our patch notes, but it probably should have been messaged more clearly in order to avoid surprise. 

Again, as a matter of philosophy, we find nothing at all wrong with players making a non-trivial amount of gold from something like a weekly Black Temple or Icecrown transmog run at max level.
