<br>
Holy Wrath Hotfix<br>
We just deployed a hotfix to modify Holy Wrath so this spell has the same diminishing return mechanics that other player stun spells and abilities currently have. This will prevent Undead creatures that we wish to be susceptible to stun from being permanently stunned if you include enough Paladins in your raid who then rotate their Holy Wrath casts.<br>
<br>
This will affect the difficulty of Anub&apos;arak, but we didn&apos;t want the &quot;right way&quot; to defeat this fight to involve bringing five Paladins who glyphed their Holy Wrath spell. <br>
<br>
Trial of the Grand Crusader Difficulty Hotfix<br>
We just hotfixed the following changes to the Trial of the Grand Crusader (aka Heroic mode).<br>
<br>
Northrend Beasts<br>
Fixed a bug where the flag that prevents a creature from gaining attack speed after a parry was inadvertently left off Gormok the Impaler. This bug is fixed in normal mode as well.<br>
Increased the amount of time players have to defeat the encounter before Icehowl berserks.<br>
You have an extra half second to get out of the way of a very angry charging Yeti. Players with high ping rejoice.<br>
Icehowl will become tauntable. (This particular element isn&apos;t hotfixed quite yet, but should be shortly).<br>
<br>
Lord Jaraxxus<br>
Infernal Eruption will now spawn an additional Felflame Infernal the instant the eruption occurs.<br>
Nether Portal now summons Mistresses of Pain slightly more often. <br>
<br>
Recent In-Game Fixes - September 2009 - 09/08<br>
09/08/09<br>
<br>
For both 10- and 25-player heroic modes, the Felflame Infernals and Mistresses of Pain will spawn a little quicker in the Lord Jaraxxus encounter.<br>
Gormok the Impaler no longer attacks quickly after a parry in any difficulty.<br>
Icehowl takes a bit longer to enter the arena in 10- and 25-player Heroic modes.<br>
Icehowl takes longer to berserk in both 10- and 25-player Heroic modes.<br>
Relentless Gladiator ranged weapons damage has been adjusted to the appropriate value for their item level.<br>
Holy Wrath now has diminishing returns and shares this with all other stuns.</div></div>
