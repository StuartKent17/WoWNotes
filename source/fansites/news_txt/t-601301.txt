Boubouille2007-05-20, 06:43 PMUpdate : For The Horde http://www.for-the-horde.de also had some tries on Kael'thas, and since we've got screenshots of the actual fight I guess it's one of the first if not the first glance at the fight itself. The two last ones are from the phase 2 of the fight where you fight the legendary weapons to be able to loot them. Had to blur some conversations, the annoying lvl 1 is obviously not me. *cough*

For The Horde http://www.for-the-horde.de went in Coilfang with a GM and had a try on the new Vashj .... They dropped something very interesting. It wasn't a legit kill, according to a member of the raid the encounter still needs massive tuning to be manageable with the 2.1.0 consumables changes

So you might ask ... What's the use ? Easy, you can use this scroll to attune someone to Serpentshrine Cavern instantly, no quest, nothing You use it like any other scroll, if you still can't really understand, think about a Scroll of Stamina. Kael'thas will also drop an item of the same kind.

The other loots were + Nether Vortexes, Tier 5 tokens
[Coral Band of the Revived]
[Ring of Endless Coils]
