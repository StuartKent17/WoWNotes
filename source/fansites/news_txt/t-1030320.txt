Diablo 3 - Even with the patch coming I'm still working on shiny new Diablo stuff! Today on Diablofans we have a nice Diablo 3 Mystic and Item Enhancements Preview http://www.diablofans.com/!

Patch 4.3 on live realms this week
Patch 4.3 will be deployed on live realms this week, as usual there is a 1% chance that it will not happen if something goes really wrong but you should expect to be able to enter the Dragon Soul raid and kick deathwing's ... butt? on November 29th in the US and November 30th in EU. Time for the giant recap of what to expect from this patch!

Raid Finder
The new Raid Finder tool http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/623-Patch-4.3-Raid-Finder/ is a new way to build raids similar to the Looking for Dungeon tool. You can now queue for a 25-man raid and pretty much instantly jump in the fight to get your shiny epics! It also comes with a new "Looking for Raid" difficulty that makes bosses easier and puggable.

Tier 13 Armor Sets
New raid instance means new Tier armor sets and the Tier 13 might be one of the best design we've seen in a while!

Valor Points Rewards and Raid Loot
A lot of gear has been added in this patch, you can get a lot of gear for your character from the Patch 4.3 Valor Points Rewards http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/179-Patch-4.3-Valor-Points-Rewards/ and for those of you who don't want to check individual bosses loot lists, we have a nice Dragon Soul Raid Loot List http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2556-Dragon-Soul-Raid-Loot-Compilation-Fan-Art.


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/november/valorpoint_th.jpg http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/179-Patch-4.3-Valor-Points-Rewards/ http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/november/raidlootlist_th.jpg http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2556-Dragon-Soul-Raid-Loot-Compilation-Fan-Art

Also, Valor Points are now earned at the same rate in 10 and 25-man instances now. 
We've made slight adjustments to the Valor Point VP drops on the 4.3 PTR which testers can now see. In both 10- and 25-player raids, bosses will now drop 100 VP each down from 115 and 135 respectively. We’ll also be changing Firelands raid bosses to drop 50 VP per kill upon release of the patch.

This change is being made to further emphasize the desire to kill bosses for the items they drop. In the 4.3 raid, tier sets can only be earned from boss drops, and as Raid Finder will allow for just about anyone to get a chance to kill bosses, we think there will be less need for Valor overall. We want to try to match the lower desire for VP with a slightly slower acquisition rate.

We appreciate your thoughts and constructive discussion on how these changes may affect you and your guild once 4.3 is released.


5-Man Instances - Well of Eternity, Hour of Twilight, and End Time
Three new 5-man instances are added to the game!

Season 11 Armor Sets and PvP Rewards
For all the PvPers out there we have a nice list of Season 11 Armor Sets and PvP Gear http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/659-Season-11-Armor-Sets-Patch-4.3/!


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/november/s11_th.jpg http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/659-Season-11-Armor-Sets-Patch-4.3/

Don't forget that you can also earn Conquest points from regular battlegrounds victories now, and the amount of Conquest points earned in Rated BG has been considerably increased.
In patch 4.3 we’re changing the daily battleground BG to reward 100 conquest for a win up from 25. In addition, every non-rated BG that you win will also give you 50 conquest. There is no limit to how many BGs you can run this way, up to the normal conquest cap.

Our intent is to start acting even more on our Mists of Pandaria philosophies of encouraging players to approach the content they want to, how they want to, and be able to work toward meaningful player progression. Arenas and rated battlegrounds will still earn Conquest faster, but with this change you can now work your way up by running normal BGs, if you so choose.

It no longer ramps up slowly at the beginning of a fight. Instead, the first melee attack taken by the tank generates Vengeance http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/93098/ equal to 33% of the damage taken by that attack. In addition, as it updates periodically during the fight, it's always set to at least 33% of the damage taken by the tank in the last 2 seconds.
