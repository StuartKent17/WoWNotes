Corrected an issue that prevented Assassination Rogues from queuing for Legion dungeons even after obtaining their Artifact.


Items

Rhonin's Assaulting Armwraps http://www.wowdb.com/items/132413-rhonins-assaulting-armwraps will now activate only once per cast of Arcane Missiles. Proc rate and buff duration have been adjusted to compensate. Increased to 25% chance for 6 sec, up from 10% chance and 5 sec
Sephuz's Secret http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret should now be activated by Grimoire: Felguard's Axe Toss.


Quests

Legion players who had begun the post-Broken Shore event quests, but not completed them, should now be eligible to receive “In the Blink of an Eye”.


Artifact

The Living Flames summoned by Felsoul Crushers now give appropriate levels of experience during "The Hunt".
Players should now properly receive credit for traveling to the Emerald Dreamway during "Cleansing the Mother Tree" when using the Dreamwalk ability.
Stormweaver Ingrida should no longer sometimes evade during "Stolen Thunder".


Highmountain

The Weapon Racks on Torok's Bluff can now be interacted with after their first use during the Bonus Objective "Vengeance for the Stonedark".
Credit for enemies defeated during the quest "Huln's War - Reinforcements" should now be shared among all nearby players.


Stormheim

Dread-Rider Malwick should respawn more readily, allowing for completion of “Assault and Battery”.
Players who are ready to turn in the quest “The Splintered Fleet” can now always see Dread-Rider Cullen. If she has just flown away, she will re-appear within a few minutes.
Players who abandon the quest “Dances with Ravenbears” should no longer retain the quest ability bar.
“Greymane’s Gambit” now reliably credits the player for completing the scenario.
“The Splintered Fleet” now reliably credits the player for completing the scenario.
The Skyfire Propeller should no longer become untouchable during “Signal Boost”.


Val’sharah

Pollous the Fetid is now always roaming around Dreadroot in Val’sharah and defeatable, allowing “Purging the River” to be completed.
Players who are in a group and arrive late for the final kill in “The Fate of Val’sharah” should receive credit and be able to proceed.
Fixed a number of issues with the "Defend The Temple" Bonus Objective in Val'sharah.

Smoothest Launch Ever!
Shout out to our amazing server engineers https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/770533667131133952 and the other folks who have helped make this launch a success! A lot of them worked tirelessly through long and stressful nights to make sure this went smooth. They typically live in the background of our day-to-day activities here, but I've never seen such an awesome launch since I started playing WoW, so the praise is deserved!

Another shout out to all the testers who have tirelessly supplied their feedback and notes on bugs, issues, and crashes over the course of Alpha and Beta - you guys helped create this experience as well, and we couldn't have done it without you.

Blizzard has amazing teams, and it's been awesome seeing us all come together to pull this off. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/756707-smoothest-launch-ever/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20748896027?page=1#8

Cenarion Circle Reputation and Artifact Quests
I can't do the Druid artifact quests because I'm hostile with the Cenarion Circle. Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem won't speak to me. Can you guys turn him into a neutral faction NPC please? I know this is karma for the hours spent murdering Moonglade Guards but this is literally barring me entry from WoW Legion. I'm pretty sad right now. 
This issue has been hotfixed. 

Cenarion Circle has decided to make peace with everyone. 

You should now all be able to get the quest.

If you find any remaining issues related to this issue please let us know.

Enjoy Legion! Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/756458-cant-do-artifact-quest-hated-by-moonglade/ / Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17613292097?page=5#85

Amazon Collector's Edition Delay
Just got word from Amazon today, release day, on the day I was supposed to take delivery that my Collector's Edition will not arrive until sometime between the end of September and the end of October.
We have been investigating this and learned that there was a shipping issue which impacted some players who pre-ordered their CE from select retailers. We’re currently working with these retailers to address this issue and make sure these players get their copy of the CE as quickly as possible. We hope that this will be resolved shortly for you and any others affected.
