A lot of posts have been made about classes changes in the beta, below is a list with most of them. Also included a few posts about the upcoming features.<br>
New Items Bag Types<br>
Your bags will be ok. I promise. Pets, Mounts, Heroic Badges, BG Tokens are all getting storage space. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8202616153&amp;postId=82016707206&amp;sid=1#4))<br>

A lot of the existing quests are still being tweaked. We also have plans to do a few more at the end to make the transition to good old EP a little less jarring. We even have a new Ebon Hold that is a little smaller and easier to navigate. One of the best parts of WoW should be even better by the time we go live. If you haven&apos;t spent much time in Northrend, many of the quests there are of this caliber with equally interesting mechanics. It&apos;s hard to compress as many into such a great story as the DK start zone though. The good news is that some of the plot threads started in Acherus extend up into Northrend....

We have no plans to implement a &quot;Dire Cat&quot; form at this time. &quot;Dire Bear&quot; exists for the sole purpose of upgrading the Feral Druid&apos;s armor value to match the Warrior/Paladin etc. (Druids get no shield) We do, however, intend to allow Druids to be able to use items and enchants with procs in forms, which I believe will work in the next beta build (don&apos;t hold me to it though). (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8202533456&amp;postId=82016109208&amp;sid=1#8))<br>
I think what Kalgan meant was that we intend to do different texture variances for Druid forms, including Cat form. Which is true, though not sure how soon we&apos;re going to get that. They may come from a repeatable quest, or through inscription. Regarding the &quot;Feral Range Bug,&quot; that really is not a bug. Have a Warrior, Rogue or any melee class play without using a snare and you&apos;ll encounter the same issue. The issue is that the server and client are not sync. When you try to do damage to the target, while your client shows him on your screen, the server disagree&apos;s and gives you an error. Snares help alleviate the problem, which is what we&apos;re giving Feral Druids in the form of &quot;Infected Wounds&quot; for the expansion.

I just had a chat with our programmers and we do have some new tech for WOLK intended to help solve the melee range issue. The server will try to &quot;predict&quot; the range between you and your target, which we hope will make the issue less evident. This has not yet been implemented in beta, but I&apos;ll let you know when we do finally put in the change.

When your pet gains a level, it will automatically gain a new rank of Growl if one is available at that level. The only thing you really need to manage is which talents to choose... and keeping your spore bat fed and happy. You don&apos;t learn skills from (disposable) beasts any longer, and the only thing to do at the Pet Trainer is untalent your pet. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8202274213&amp;postId=82016380798&amp;sid=1#3))<br>
We didn&apos;t want hunters to have spend a big chunk of talent points just to get pet resistance up to where it is in Burning Crusade. So pets will have some amount of inherent resistance. We&apos;re not sure how much that will be yet, but it should be enough that your pet doesn&apos;t feel fragile. If you want a truly magic-resistant pet, you can top it off with talents. For now at least the lower ranks of the old resistance skills are just free like Growl and Cower.

There are talents in all 3 pet trees that you can invest in if maintaining happiness is a problem (or just annoying) for you. We&apos;re also trying to give you a few more options to keep your pet alive, such as more Avoidance and reduced spell damage, and even more ways to heal your pet. Of course you can always choose to focus directly on more damage and hope your pet survives long enough to make good use of it.

Think of your pet bar as just shortcuts to your spellbook. It doesn&apos;t really matter if an ability is on the bar or not. It can be cast or autocast directly from the spellbook, and unfortunately all new abilities start with autocast defaulted on. This is something we might be able to fix, but in the meantime, peek at your pet&apos;s spellbook whenever it gains a level to make sure nothing has changed. Cower can surprise you, because it/si something a lot of players passed on before -- understandably, because even if effective it&apos;s not a very fun thing to spend points on, which is why we just give it away now.

We haven&apos;t done a major pass on threat generation yet for any of the classes. We realize it was very easy in BC for hunters to pull aggro off of their pets. You can probably tell from some of the pet talents (including the ones that just grant more pet dps) that we want pets to be able to hold their own threat against a hunter. This is especially true when it&apos;s just you and Bitey out on your own, but ideally a tanking pet with the proper spec will be an effective offtank for 5-player instances, or even a main tank under some circumstances (say a group quest perhaps).

In terms of Blessing of Salvation and Defiance, we&apos;re turning away from requiring talents and spells to grant threat and instead just &quot;bake&quot; it into the existing threat generation abilities.

We&apos;ll be removing the imposed cooldown on Circle of Healing in an upcoming beta build. We&apos;ll experiment with the ability having no cooldown, but it&apos;s still possible we may decide it needs it. We are indeed concerned with the impact AOE heals such as Circle of Healing, Chain Heal etc. have in endgame raiding, but we haven&apos;t decided the best way to address the issue.
