Developer Communication
If only the class balance Devs in WoW listened to the community like the Devs in Overwatch. et al are way too prideful to care.
.I'm honestly really curious where this idea comes from. What gives this impression? Is it because we talk through WarcraftDevs? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820025185201860613
As opposed to as individual developers through personal accounts Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820025310292783104

I can just see how someone might think the OW team is more responsive. I do really like their community team.
Absolutely. I agree with all of this. WoW and Overwatch are different games, and so communication styles for one... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820038428414746625
...may not work as well for the other. Like for us, the communication that our most engaged players really want... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820038674154856448
...is spec-specific, resulting in it taking 36x as long to get to everyone. Much harder to provide value to all. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820039175583870977

Truly and honestly, something is not being communicated properly to the Devs via CM's. Wh… https://t.co/hDuHQuBggm
I don't think anyone on either side disagrees that more communication is desired/needed. It's just an *extremely* hard problem. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820026571444482049
As a developer myself I don't see how hard it is to take 30 mins of your time everyday to actually read… https://t.co/JnK3Pb2zBf
You are *sorely* mistaken if you don't think we spend at least 30min of our day reading feedback. Probably between 2-10x that. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820027645307981824
Problem is, there are 36 specs, each of which have vital feedback. Just reading feedback takes time, let alone responding to it. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820027813788909568
is it too much to ask the designers to post on class forums weekly to discuss whats going on in the team?
A weekly update on every class, let alone every spec, would likely consume >20% of our dev time. Hard to justify. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820049644998664192

Lore
Hi,are Odyn's golden valkyrs made of Light since they use Light spells while the Lich King's dark valkyrs beings of Shadow?
Lich King subjugated valkyr and converted them to servants of the Scourge. As opposed to creating brand new ones. Alex_Afrasiabi https://twitter.com/Alex_Afrasiabi/status/819948739179606016
I see. Could you confirm that the Odyn's golden valkyrs are made of Light as suggested ingame by their Light spells and all?
Light is source of life on Azeroth. Safe to say that they are affected in some way by it, as are all most living things Alex_Afrasiabi https://twitter.com/Alex_Afrasiabi/status/819997216181891072

Upcoming Legendary Changes
I have thoroughly enjoyed most aspects of legion. I consider myself a top tier raider, however im not able to play at a high level because of the rng on top of rng legendary system. Ive been benched in 2 guilds because of it and ended up taking a break for 3 weeks due to frustration. Many others and myself included have had the displeasure of receiving 3 utility legendary in a row. This has to be the most terrible experience, I've had in all the years I've played wow since early vanilla.

Blizzard, id really like to stress this, ill say it again. I cant begin to explain to you how terrible it feels to players, who have received 3 non dps increase legendary in a row. How can this amount of in-game tragedy be allowed? It is disgusting. You have created an incredible expansion, don't you have any pride? Why hasn't something, anything been done about this? Please, respond! Anything!
There are a fair number of additions/tweaks in 7.2 to the legendary system. They've not been introduced on PTR yet but they are coming and this is something we will be actively seeking feedback on. Some of the issues that you highlight are things that we are hoping to ameliorate with these changes.

Please have patience with us as we roll out new quest/feature content on PTR next week and then move into rolling out the item/reward/systems changes. It is a bit of staged progressive rollout to focus testing and feedback but there are additional changes coming. 

Please continue to supply feedback throughout this process though. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/795641-blizzard-read-this-how-can-you-allow-this/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753095273?page=1#20

Frost Mage - Brain Freeze
The counter then is when you follow a frostbolt with an Ebonbolt. Right now the brain freeze proc happens quick enough to abort the cast. If it's delayed I'd be much further along and it would be a bigger dps loss to cancel.

Edit: not trying to be difficult, just want to avoid getting a new problem.
Stating again that this is not a fully-formed plan yet, but to make sure I was clear: my expectation in that case is that you would cast Frostbolt->Ebonbolt->Flurry->Ice Lance->Flurry->Ice Lance where Ebonbolt's Brain Freeze appears a split-second after the first Flurry. We would not want it to be optimal to abort the Ebonbolt cast, in any case.
