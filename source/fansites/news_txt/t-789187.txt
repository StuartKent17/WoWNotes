Boubouille2010-11-12, 08:54 AM25 vs 25 Bracket in Rated Battlegrounds Removed
After much though and deliberation, we have decided to remove the 25 v 25 bracket from rated battlegrounds. We felt that overall, it created too many logistical issues for players and that in the long run, most players would just skip that week in the rotation.

Thanks for all the feedback on this issue, we are listening.


Cataclysm Raid Markers
One of the latest beta build upgraded the raid markers to improve them visually, below is a small preview.

Cataclysm Models - Al'akir and Druid Worgen Flight Form
Apparently I forgot to post these models a while back and I couldn't miss an occasion to prove that complaining works! http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/788194-Missing-Models. Below is the in-game model of Al'akir http://www.wowpedia.org/Al%27akir and the flight form of worgen druids.

All raids open for testing on Beta Servers
I've opened up access to all the Cataclysm raid content on each of the four beta servers again.

Both normal and heroic difficulties are available.

Player vs. Player
Hitting Higher Level Players
Actually, it's already substantially easier to hit a higher level player in PvP than it is to hit an NPC of the equivalent level; though perhaps not to the extent you had in mind. On the same token, PvP is only really intended to be a reasonable challenge between characters that are within a few levels of each other.

Gaining levels should confer power, and it's not at all untoward for a higher level character to have a significant advantage over a much lower level character. If one wants to beat a higher level player in PvP, then it's in their best interest to gear up, study up, and deliver a satisfying beat down once they catch up.

Zealotry
Zealotry in Cataclysm does not consume Holy Power and is not on the GCD.

This seems to be a common misperception, probably because this is a change from how it works on live, so I wanted to clear it up and maybe nudge the theorycrafting towards some more accurate numbers. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/129673/suggestion-for-zealotry-change

Recent Discipline changes on Beta
The intent was that with the new PW:Barrier and a very strong Prayer of Healing, Disc would be good at group healing, and buffing Grace would make sure they can deliver the throughput on a single target, since they can't layer as many multiple spells on the same target the way a druid can.

We're still looking at priest base heals though Heal, Flash Heal, Greater Heal because we're concerned neither Disc nor Holy is using them enough. If we end up buffing those then both Disc and Holy will be even stronger on single targets. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/129528/disc-priest-changes-build-13277---yeah-baby
