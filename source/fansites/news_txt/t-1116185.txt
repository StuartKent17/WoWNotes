Boubouille2012-04-14, 03:33 PMUpdate #2 - Moving to temporary comments once again, hopefully we'll fix the bug for good this time. 
Update - Comments are playing hide and seek again, tech team is on it. 

Druid Symbiosis Spells
Druids get a fun new ability http://www.wowdb.com/spells/110309 in Mists of Pandaria that gives them a spell from another class and the target an ability from the druid. With the help http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1103278-MoP-Symbiosis of some of our nice forum users, Sunfyre compiled a list http://www.owlkin.org/2012/03/23/symbiosis-results/ of all of the ability swaps that take place. 

These abilities are changing every patch, so consider them a preview and not the final list of spells.

World Boss Raid - Galleon
Galleon is one of the new World Bosses in Mists of Pandaria, located in the Valley of the Four Winds. He currently spawns a few times a day on the beta servers, and our wonderful livestreamers http://www.twitch.tv/mmo_champion made an attempt http://www.twitch.tv/mmo_champion/b/314820301 2:07:48 to defeat him with 80 players that was unsuccessful down to ~65%.

This time around they are going to make another attempt with more players on Sunday April 15th at 22:00 CET / 4:00 PM EST. This will take place on the Mekkatorque-EU beta realm. The spawn timing isn't known exactly right now, so if you want to take part, be ready to spend some time waiting. For more details speak with Niklive Alliance or Longview Horde in game. 

There are multiple mobs involved in the encounter, with Galleon and Chief Salyis being the main two. Galleon has 261 Million health and Chief Salyis has 11 million health.


Fire Shot http://www.wowdb.com/spells/121673-fire-shot - Saurok Skirmishers riding on Galleon's back fire flaming crossbow bolts at random players, inflicting 15,000 Fire damage.
Stomp http://www.wowdb.com/spells/121787-stomp - Galleon stomps the ground, inflicting 92,500 to 107,500 Physical damage to players within 70 yards and knocking them down for 3 sec.
Cannon Barrage http://www.wowdb.com/spells/121600-cannon-barrage - Chief Salyis orders his minions to fire off eight powerful cannon blasts. Each blast inflicts 300,000 Fire damage to players within 10 yards and knocks them back.
Salyin Warmonger - Chief Salyis' Warmongers periodically jump down from Galleon's back to engage players.
Impaling Pull http://www.wowdb.com/spells/121747-impaling-pull - Pulls a distant target towards the Warmonger and inflicts 13,875 to 16,125 Physical damage.

Changing Talents and Specializations
Either in the next beta build or the one after that, you will be able to speak to your appropriate class trainer and they can unspec, unglyph or untalent you for a small fee.

New Spellbook Feedback
To clarify, the new spellbook has 4 tabs 5 if you have a pet or are a druid.

The first tab is general, and contains riding, armor skills, languages and guild perks.
The second tab is your current spec tab. It contains all of the spells -- class and spec, active and passive -- that apply to your character.

The other 2-3 tabs are for other specs. They contain all of the spells class and spec that those specs can use. If you want to know if e.g. both Holy and Shadow have Power Word: Shield, you can look on those tabs.

We are currently still sorting spells within a tab by active and then passive, but we may merge them back together if the active vs. passive thing proves confusing.

This design is different from the spellbook on live, which classified every spell as belonging to a spec. This made some sense for say mages, whose spells tend to all have fire, frost or arcane theming, but didn't work well for many other classes. Sinister Strike is on the Combat tab, but Eviscerate is on the Assassination tab. Garrote is Assassination, but Sap is Subtlety. Super intuitive, huh?

We understand that putting lots of spells on one tab is overwhelming, but arbitrarily dividing spells onto multiple pages is confusing. There's no clear win either way.

Demonology Direction

You aren’t intended to be a melee caster in Meta. Things like Demonic Leap, Carrion Swarm and Immolation Aura are more situational and fun toys than core rotational spells you need on a challenging raid boss. We did experiment with Demo spending more time in melee earlier on, but we have backed off of that for some of the reasons you guys mention.
The basic rotation is something like: Keep Corruption up. Use Hand of Gul’dan on cooldown. Respond to Molten Core procs with Soul Fire. Use Shadowbolt when there is nothing else to do. Fel Flame is for movement. Breath of Gul’dan is for melee.
During Meta, all of your rotational spells should cost Fury. You shouldn’t have to pay nearly any attention to mana. 
The basic mechanic of Demonic Fury is to build to 1000, go into Metamorphosis, and then pop out again when you reach 500. If you need that extra dps *right now*, you stay in Metamorphosis until you run out. 
There’s a bug right now where when you exit Metamorphosis, it drains half of your remaining Fury. It’s the same bug causing the DK spell conversion to drain all of your runic power.Use Demonic Slash and use Soul Fire when you get a Molten Core proc. The Molten Core procs will come from Wild Imps.

Wild Imps has changed so that imps consistently proc from your Shadowbolt and Demonic Slash. The Wild Imps in turn can proc Molten Core. If you like the old Wild Imps mechanic, you can recreate it with a glyph.

We are experimenting a lot with Demo, so let us know how these latest changes feel. We don't feel that the older design of Demo use both Fire and Shadow spells with lots of demon damage was super compelling. It is a spec that has wanted a home for some time. Affliction and Destruction by comparison have a stronger kit.

Black arrow Feedback
We agree with you that the redesigned Black Arrow hasn't worked out well yet, and even overlaps a little with the new Powershot talent. We are likely to revert Black Arrow to the 4.3 design.

Free BattleTag Change
When we introduced BattleTag nicknames, many of you created one to try the feature in the Diablo III beta test or simply establish your new identity in anticipation of Diablo III's release.

Today, we're releasing an update that will give everyone one opportunity to change their BattleTag nickname for free. If you picked a nickname you're not happy with, don't worry -- you can pick a new one. Even if you haven't created your BattleTag identifier yet, you'll still get one free BattleTag change to use after it's been created similar to the way character name changes for StarCraft II worked.

As we announced previously, BattleTag nicknames will be required in order to play Diablo III, and in the future, they'll be used in a variety of ways across all of Battle.net. To set or change your BattleTag, simply log in to Battle.net account management, head to the Account > Summary page, and look for the Create or Change option. BattleTags aren't unique, so you can pick any name you like as long as it adheres to the BattleTag Naming Policy.

Here's what you can expect from BattleTags when Diablo III launches:

Your BattleTag will serve as your public identity when chatting, grouping, or interacting with other players in Diablo III.
Once two players agree to become BattleTag friends, you'll automatically be able to see and interact with each of the Diablo III characters your friend plays automatically – no need to add multiple character names to your friends list individually.
Prior to the game's release, your presence on the Diablo III forums will be connected to your BattleTag, rather than any one specific character in the game. You'll transcend boundaries!

Our long-term plans include adding the ability for BattleTag friends to participate in cross-game chat in StarCraft II, Diablo III, and World of Warcraft, and future Blizzard Entertainment games, as well as offer other features similar to what's currently available via Real ID. More cool additions to BattleTag are on the horizon, but we're not quite ready to talk about those yet.

We'll continue to keep you up to date on our plans for BattleTag nicknames as more info becomes available. For more details, check out the BattleTag FAQ http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/battletagfaq.
