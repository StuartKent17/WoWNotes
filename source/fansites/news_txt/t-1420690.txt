New Game Job Listing - Lead Producer
An interesting job listing was added earlier this week for a Lead Producer http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/posting.html?id=13000JU to work on a new game. This game is apparently also using a small team, just like Hearthstone did, as the listing mentions following in the footsteps of the small and nimble game team. 

According to his most recent tweet https://twitter.com/_MikeBooth/status/410230930880466946, it looks like Michael Booth is also on this team. He was lead on Left 4 Dead and worked on Counter-Strike, but started at Blizzard in May and is currently Game Director.

Free Character Migrations
Firstly, I appreciate your efforts to remain constructive while clearly feeling frustrated by the topic. 

This time around, we opened up FCMs to the minority factions as well, so they can move away from realms with queues if they want to, as you suggested. The main reason for FCMs right now is to relieve queues, so it makes sense to allow as many people to move as possible.

Previously, we tried to help with faction balance on realms with queues by only offering FCMs to players on the dominant faction. To help with faction balance on the destination realms too, these FCMs would generally place people on a realm where they would now be in the minority faction. This wasn't working. So, to make FCMs appeal to more people, in some cases we're now opening FCMs between realms with similar faction balance, e.g. from a horde-dominant realm to another horde-dominant realm. 

We're keeping tabs on the situation, people still may not take the offer, but we'll see how it goes. As I said, our current main goal is to reduce queues so people can actually play.

There's a lot going on at the moment, what with Connected Realms happening. Populations and faction balances are fluctuating across the board. Right now, our focus is making sure as many people as possible can get online to play without having to queue. However, when things have settled, we hope to be in a position to help with other factors.

PvP
Really? Getting rid of factions is the only solution to imbalanced pvp realms I can think of.
Arenas and BGs already ignore realms and the world PvP zone in Warlords will use a partial connected realm solution. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407929525759000576

S12 community outcry "FFS LOWER PVP BURST!" A: "Okay we'll buff PvPower on all weapons", and you still wonder why we hate you?
I don't wonder. I just don't take people who hate other people because of a *video game* very seriously. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408258370395570177
Ok "hate" might be a strong word here, however those kind of nonsense decisions are the reason why people are happy you quit.
If we hadn't buffed PvP power on weapons, people would have used PvE weapons. The DPS would have been there anyway. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408301115826905088
That's why the PvP community suggested to buff resilience accordingly, you didn't listen and subs were cancelled, go figure...
Players can make stronger arguments by just arguing fun, which will resonate more with the devs you're presumably trying to reach Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408354107812872192
You can't admit those mistakes and that's another big reason why PvPers dislike you. Whatever, you finally left, take care man
We admit PvP mistakes all the time, which is why we constantly change the way gear and resilience work and are again for 6.0. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408663973873983489
We're in pretty close contact with many great PvP players. They may not agree with every call we make but they know we hear them, Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408664327994884096
But your original argument IIRC was that we didn't listen to PvP players, which just isn't true. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408664086377820160
Nothing has bene done about RMD and WMD. People want quick changes if something is broken. PvE gets hotfixes.
So does PvP, though to be fair, it is easier to test and predict the result of PvE changes. PvP ultimately needs to be played. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408752861812494336

Spirit on Items
if spirit is limited to non-armour pieces, won't it cripple healers early on before they get those somewhat rare items?
Base regen will be higher. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406137032847540224

Spirit is a buffer. More of it helps those who have no understanding of mana efficiency.
That is the intent for sure. Some healers grab Spirit the way a rogue would grab Agility, which detracts from it being a choice. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407312646023553026
so as a DK I can us all my Items for Tank and DPS, since Tank also uses Haste/Crit. But Elesham still need Healgear?
Tanks also need bonus armor and trinkets that proc on damage taken. The difference should be about the same as swapping to heal. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407619052211691520

You probably already considered this, but having Spirit "replace" Intellect as a primary stat might work?
We like Spirit being a choice though. Agility can never really be a choice. More Agi is always better. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407623226278170624

But why do this back and forth stuff? Spirit is important. Now it's not as important. Ok, now it's important again.
We have often had a problem where regen is too tough in blues and too easy in endgame epics. MoP was a big improvement though. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407928885838217218
The problem with spirit is that it's a quality of life stat at the expense of a through-put stat.
We disagree. It's not quality of life -- it's how many expensive spells you can afford to cast. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408033796152229888

Why exactly do healers get their own stat, but you refuse to make dps-only items? short of certain proc trinks
Largely because there are a lot more DPS players, both in a group and across the population as a whole. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407623894841843713

Spirit is always important to healers. We're not changing that philosophy. Important and maxxed out aren't the same thing though. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407928684259975168

Having hit on a healer set is a wasted stat. I'd even buy having your worst secondary stat on every piece might be a waste. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407928229765189632
