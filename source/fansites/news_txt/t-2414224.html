Daughter of the Sea song<br>
So Blizz, where can we download the song in the Warbringers: Jaina short? That music was really f-cking good and I want it on my phone so I can listen to it on repeat. Any plans to put it available on iTunes? Spotify? Amazon? etc?<br>
<br>
Currently at this time it&apos;s not downloadable. I&apos;ll pass on that you guys were asking for it though and ask. I know it wasn&apos;t mentioned on this thread but I&apos;ve seen it asked in a lot of places and wanted to point out that is actually Laura Bailey singing as Jaina Proudmoore and Donal Kearney sings the male lead. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1096437-daughter-of-the-sea-song/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20766016910?page=1#8))<br>

MDI All-Stars Team Selection Update<br>
The MDI All-Stars event at BlizzCon promises to be one of the most exciting moments in our extended rollout of Battle for Azeroth. To ensure the competitive integrity of the event, the WoW Esports team is disqualifying Gulch Trotters from the MDI All-Stars event.<br>
<br>
Two members of Gulch Trotters, the fourth-place finishers in the MDI competition, are no longer eligible to participate in WoW Esports events due to suspension for Terms of Use violations. Going into MDI All-Stars, teams are allowed a single substitution to keep the spirit of fair play. Because the team won&#x2019;t have the required number of eligible players, Gulch Trotters will be replaced by Free Marsy at the MDI All-Stars exhibition.<br>
<br>
More information on the Mythic Dungeon Invitational All-Stars event, including schedule and format, will be released soon.<br>
