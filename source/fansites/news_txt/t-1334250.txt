Patch 5.4 Developer Interviews
Horde for Life http://hordeforlife.com/2013/08/21/horde-for-life-special-developer-episode-marco-koegler/ had the chance to interview Marco Koegler Technical Director recently. You can find information from previous interviews on our Patch 5.4 Developer Interviews page http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1345.

Technical Aspects

Developing WoW with countries that have poor network connectivity in mind is part of the reason why you can play WoW relatively well on a poorer connection. 
Making the game feel like you are playing locally by compensating for latency on the client and server end has always been an important part of development.
Fixes that took days in the past now take a matter of hours thanks to the advancement in how patching is done. 
Whenever new features are added, people on older hardware are kept in mind to make sure the game is playable for them still. It is a painful process to maintain that kind of compatibility, but Blizzard doesn't want people to be unable to play the game due to new features.


Gameplay

The BMAH has been successful at giving players that are focused on earning gold items to purchase, such as mounts, pets, transmog sets, and other things. It was also useful in phasing in access to the Brawler's Guild. There aren't any changes to the BMAH planned. It isn't decided yet if new locations will be added outside of Pandaria in the future. 
CCP allows players to run somewhat more freely with the economy, but Blizzard is interested in making sure that no one has a severe impact on other players. 


Experiments and the Economy

The Guardian Cub was an experiment in allowing people to sell an item purchased with real currency for gold. If it would have been hugely popular, we might have seen more things like it. Playing with an established economy is dangerous though, so the devs are careful not to do anything major.
There are currently no plans to directly sell gold to players. It wouldn't be popular with players or good for the game.
The new items added to the in game store in Patch 5.4 are really only targeted at Asia as time saving conveniences. Blizzard definitely doesn't want to venture into the pay to win territory or change the current business model. It is an experiment, similar to the Guardian Cub.


Previous Expansions

At one point in developing the water effects for Cataclysm the oceans were 3D, moving up and down and side to side, but it looked odd with characters swimming in it. Having the waves move players or making them less visible under waves didn't work out well, so the team went with a 2D water surface with a ripple effect. 
Vashj'ir made it difficult to place spells in a 3D environment. There was also an underwater wave effect that gave some people motion sickness, which was addressed by making the effect less pronounced in the center of the screen.

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment.

Change to RPPM Mechanics
As an update to this, as part of our continued balancing, we're going to increase the "time since last proc" reset on boss pulls to 120 seconds.

Experience Increase Potions
Hold your horses. The in-game store items http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/103557-enduring-elixir-of-wisdom that you mentioned may be popular in Asia, but we have to see what pans out here in Europe and the US.

IMO sets that become classics are ones that embody a class in some way. T16 has coherent theme accross all sets, but doesn't -
I see what you're saying, but polls of best sets always skew towards early ones, which makes me think nostalgia plays a big role. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366721209469124609

Please rethink this RPPM change. Fun trinkets like UVLS are now having stupid low uptimes. Better yet, go to back to ICD.
ICD trinkets just feel passive. Every 10 sec, you get 1000 stats like clockwork. With RPPM we wanted to recapture fun double procs. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363743676108783617

quick q: do you guys nerf drop rates anywhere near as often as people think you do without telling us in patch notes?
No. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366010430650458112

the expansion is coming to an end and for the first time in the last 3 I don't have all classes at level cap. Alts != fun atm.
Many players got so many maxed out alts during the final patch in ICC and DS. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364605191573614594
mostly the gear hump once you ding 90. Takes so much maintenance to be current. Wish valor ot Ancients stacked
If you go Flex or Heroic Scenarios, there is no ilevel. If you want higher ilevel for that or other content try Timeless Isle Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364880183313960961
Hscenario takes ilvl I'm almost sure. 
In 5.3. Not in 5.4. We concluded that premade content generally doesn't need those requirements, Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364956775033745412
You seem to miss that many heroic scenario groups are being built using the trade chat. It's infact not premade
Premade is premade. If you invite even a stranger you have a chance to vet or kick them. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365274035350798336

will the item upgrade NPC stay with the release of 5.4?
That is what we are thinking at the moment. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364604161167339520

So, will I be able to send heirlooms to a connected realm?
The goal of connected realms is to give you folks to play with, not to give you more alts. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364601138647007232
I'm not saying it won't happen, but just keep the goal in mind -- that's our priority. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364601221220278273

Also did you play pre-reforge version of WOW? believe me no one wants it back reforge became core of wow's end game style.
Can you explain why? Nobody is making interesting decisions, except possibly healers. Everyone else follows a website or calculator. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366707503725150209
Reforging is good because it means the gap between BiS and everything else is smaller. "Interesting" isn't relevant.
Interesting decisions are much more important to the developers than the gap between BiS and not BiS. YMMV. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367368021615968257
the only real gap exists between "interesting for developers" and "interesting for players".
They are sometimes at odds since the player mindset is typically to remove obstacles and the developers' is to add them. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367373215040933888
It may be counter intuitive, but obstacles are fun. Curving tracks with hills and koopas > straight drag strips. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367373652838215680

For hardcore raiders, having highly geared "Alts" is needed.
That's a choice very competitive guilds make. I don't see why we'd need to make alts easier to level and gear just for them. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366708514263011328

Then stop adding flavor items that players can't collect. Do you expect people to farm for items then trash them?
Inventory space is a resource. It has been since vanilla. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366707307318493184

And that's different from the current legendaries how? You created the sense of entitlement by making them readily available
The cloaks are just a different cat entirely. Nearly everyone can get them. The original question was class-specific weapons. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366705752607424512
In some ways, we thought glaives worked better than daggers, when rogues could sort of know the date they would be completed. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366705886359584768
