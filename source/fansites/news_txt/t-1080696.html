Till Death Do You Part - Iron Man WoW Challenge<br>
Players across Azeroth have recently embraced a new, very personal achievement: leveling a character &quot;Iron Man&quot; style. What started out as only a small movement, this bare bones, no-frills style of play has now transformed into a community-wide call-to-arms known as the Iron Man WoW Challenge, inviting World of Warcraft enthusiasts to see how close they can get to level cap with only the barest of necessities.<br>
<br>
The goal of the Iron Man WoW challenge is simple: reach level 85. The catch, however, is that you must accomplish this task without the assistance of talents, class specialization, stat-improved gear, professions, buffs, item enhancements, or other players. And if you die? Well, then it&#x2019;s back to square one.<br>
<br>
Here are some of the latest rules (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3966606644):<br>

THE BIG ONE: If you die, EVER, that character is removed from the challenge. [...]<br>

The Most Valued Forum Posters<br>
It&#x2019;s been quite a while since we&#x2019;ve shared information regarding our forum MVP program. If you frequent Blizzard forums you&#x2019;ve no doubt seen jade text stamped across threads here and there. Those with the power to wield green words are regular players -- just like you -- who&#x2019;ve been recognized for their contributions to the forums in one way or another. And since we want to provide these player advocates with the resources they need to continue being awesome posters, MVPs have direct lines of contact with Blizzard community managers.<br>
<br>
Now the time has come to bolster the MVP ranks. Those chosen for the program aren&#x2019;t official representatives of Blizzard, and they don&#x2019;t have to agree with every decision we make. They also aren&#x2019;t expected to give up their posting personas in order to join. Our goal is to find frequent posters who are a positive influence on the gaming community in some form, whether it be through posting strategy guides or tips on various aspects of gameplay, or even just bringing a positive and constructive tone to the forums when socializing with their peers.<br>
<br>
If you or someone you know fits the description of a Most Valuable Poster as laid out in the MVP FAQ (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4038704715?page=1#2), email us at MVPs@Blizzard.com. We select MVPs based on a large set of criteria, so don&#x2019;t be discouraged from putting your name out there if you only post on, say, the Protoss Discussion or DPS Class Role forums. MVPs are welcome to post wherever they&#x2019;re comfortable, including across the Diablo III, StarCraft II, and World of Warcraft forums.<br>
<br>
But remember! The key to being a strong candidate is having a solid posting history. We&#x2019;re always on the lookout for the next shining beacon of good within the community to join the illustrious ranks of our MVPs.<br>
