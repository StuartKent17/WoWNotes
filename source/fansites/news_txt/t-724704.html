Earlier this week, a survey was sent to european players to gather data on ... tons of things related to WoW. Hidden among the general WoW questions was a fairly interesting one : <br>

<br>
Apparently, Blizzard is seriously considering offering more character slots to players but you might have to pay for that. Just keep in mind that this is just a survey for the moment and it doesn&apos;t accurately reflect what we will or will not get in the future.<br>

Access the Auction House From Almost Anywhere<br>
The beta test has ended and the Auction House is now a premium feature. <br>

Existing Currencies/Badges in Cataclysm<br>
We think it&apos;s fair to let you know what&apos;s going to happen to all of that old currency. It&apos;s not yet time for us to discuss that entire plan, but we&apos;ll do so in enough time for your to react.<br>
<br>
Overall, you can expect that there won&apos;t be much motivation to hoard and even less to go out and farm old content in preparation for the Cataclysm launch.<br>
<br>
We would definitely like to get some of that stuff out of your currency UI so you don&apos;t have to look at that lonely Badge of Justice for the rest of your character&apos;s career. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25171673754/something-we-all-deserve-to-know-before-cata/))<br>

Masteries - Investing in multiple trees<br>
Almost everyone at max level will want at least 51 / something / something to gain full benefit of their passive talent trees. A Shadow priest might be something like today&apos;s 14/0/57, (Maybe 21/0/55? Maybe 15/0/61?) because we&apos;re not giving them much reason so far to subspec Holy at all. A warlock or hunter at the moment (in Cataclysm) might choose a 51/10/15, meaning points in all 3 trees. This is all early though and sometimes players don&apos;t end up going with the builds we think they will and we want you to have more flexibility than you do today.

200% Spell Crit in Cataclysm<br>
If so, does that mean smaller crits, or does that mean 200% spell crits baseline?<br>
We&apos;re not sure yet. For the hybrid classes, having the 200% crits is a good way to distinguish the casters from the non-casters (jn terms of keeping healers or melee specs from doing quite so much damage with spells). For mages and locks there is less reason for them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25170780522/cataclysm-affliction-question-for-devs/))<br>

&quot;Chaotic&quot; world in Cataclysm<br>
For all of the zones that take a turn for the worse, I would say there&apos;s an equal number of zones which improve in the chaos. Our goal is not to make the leveling experience dreary, or show you how much we can decimate familiar places. We want to add some vigor back into the old world in the wake of cataclysmic change.<br>
<br>
[...] Just to clarify, in many cases there are different areas in each zone with different types of changes. So, maybe the Barrens has been ruptured in half and made a tumultuous place of battle between the Alliance and the Horde in the south, but there are areas of the Barrens that look more beautiful than ever before. The changes in cataclysm aren&apos;t being made to shift the scale toward ugly, unforgiving terrain. You&apos;ll find a multitude of differing environments within each zone, and within the overall world. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25171674031/new-cata-mulgore-screenshot/))<br>

Armory: Guild Bank Logs Outdated<br>
We are aware of an issue which exists presently on the World of Warcraft Armory site preventing guild bank logs from properly updating. We&#x2019;re working to apply a fix for this issue and will provide an update when we have an estimated timeframe for resolution.

European Beta Guild Contest<br>
This is pretty much the case; we&apos;ll just have to see. Obviously the EU has a lot more countries and laws to take into account. Anyhow, should we have any similar announcement to make, you won&apos;t have to ask here to find out about it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/13705421290/cataclysm-beta-guild-contest/))<br>

Arcane Missiles<br>
The idea is to keep Arcane Missiles as a core mechanic that all mages want to use when it procs, but it&apos;s possible some spec may end up not using it if their other spells are propped up enough that you don&apos;t want to spend the cast time. We&apos;ll have to see when we get a little further in beta. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25170780522/cataclysm-affliction-question-for-devs/))<br>

Warlocks in Cataclysm<br>
Sorry, we just don&apos;t agree that that is a problem. It doesn&apos;t really matter if the talents are in a tree with a different name than your spec as along as the talents are useful, and those 15 certainly are.<br>
<br>
To reiterate, we like Affliction using Shadow Bolt. We don&apos;t want Affliction to rely so much on Drain Soul because that feels a lot like a Shadow priest, and we don&apos;t like any class casting nothing but dots. So Shadow Bolt is sticking around. We also don&apos;t have a problem with Shadow Bolt being a Destruction spell and being buffed by the Destruction tree. Furthermore, we have no problem with Destro using something other than Shadow Bolt even though it&apos;s a Destruction spell. Finally, we don&apos;t mind that all of those talent points buff one spell. It&apos;s a really important spell! If you had to spend 15 points to buff a spell that was a trivial amount of your damage it would be a bigger deal, but then I&apos;m fairly sure nobody would make that talent point investment in the first place.<br>
<br>
All of those arguments seem like they offend your logic or something, which isn&apos;t enough grounds for us to want to change it. Different classes work differently. Mages focus on a school of magic while warlocks focus more on a source of damage (dots, pets and nukes) but even in that case, that doesn&apos;t mean they focus on their damage source to an extent that the mage focuses on Fire, Frost or Arcane (and in Cataclysm all mages will care a lot about Arcane Missiles in any event). We are really trying to resist class homogenization and having talent trees constructed similarly for every class works against that goal. Not similar is fine. Not functional is not fine.<br>
<br>
What does bother us is having to get both Affliction and Destruction versions of hit, threat reduction, pushback resistance and range in addition to the crit damage from Ruin. Our plan is to put generic (affects all spells) talents for hit and pushback resistance in the first tier of Demonology and then just make the spells longer range so there is no need for a range talent. We&apos;re getting rid of all threat reduction talents. With the extra Cataclysm talent points, you should have more than enough points to get some in Demo and Destro as Affliction, and in fact we&apos;re leaning towards warlocks being one of those classes that does invest a little in all three trees. (Though again, not to the extent that you have no flexibility.)<br>
<br>
If you&apos;re one of those warlocks who just really, really wants Affliction or Shadow Bolt to work differently, well, you have my apologies. No doubt if you were in our shoes you might design different talent trees. I have tried to explain our choice for the design above.<br>
