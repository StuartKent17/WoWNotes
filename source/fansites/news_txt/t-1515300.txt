Warlords of Draenor - Skies
Today we are taking a look at some of the new skies in Warlords of Draenor. Keep in mind this is still early alpha, so many of them may not be complete!

Blizzcon 2014 Tickets on Sale Saturday
Blizzcon 2014 Tickets go on sale Saturday at 10 AM PST / 1 PM EST / 7 PM CET on Eventbrite http://www.eventbrite.com/e/blizzcon-november-7-8-2014-tickets-10559318205. This year they will cost $199 plus taxes and fees for the November 7th - 8th event in Anaheim. If you aren't sure who is going, you have until June 6th http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/event-info/tickets/ticket-overview to change the name and email addresses of attendees.

BlizzCon Ticket Sales - More Information
As a reminder, the second batch of BlizzCon General Admission tickets goes on sale Saturday, May 10 at 10 a.m. PDT. If you're interested in attending, you might want to take a look at our ticket-purchasing info blog http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/blog/14003199/blizzcon%C2%AE-2014-ticket-buying-tips-5-5-2014 to find out what information you'll need to have ready, or read our detailed walkthrough http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/forum/topic/12674898378 of the process. Remember there is a 4-ticket-per-household limit for General Admission tickets, and a 2-ticket limit for Benefit Dinner tickets.

We also asked Eventbrite to provide some additional details on how their waiting-room system works to help you get a better understanding of what to expect for the upcoming sales—here’s what they had to say:

The waiting room is enabled for high-demand events such as BlizzCon to seamlessly allow the first few thousand ticket buyers to complete their transactions within the registration time window. Keep in mind that being in the waiting room doesn't necessarily mean you’re guaranteed tickets. As ticket buyers complete or abandon transactions, or if they do not complete registration in time, the same number of ticket buyers will be selected from the waiting room for a chance to purchase tickets. If your turn arrives before the initial allotment of tickets has been fully claimed, you will be moved from the waiting room directly into the checkout process.

Those who come to the site after the initial allotment of tickets has been claimed will no longer be allowed in the waiting room. For those who are still in the waiting room after this point, if your requested number of tickets becomes available because other customers abandoned their purchases, you will be moved from the waiting room directly to the checkout process. In some cases, due to a variety of factors the system may attempt to move you from the waiting room to the checkout and realize that the number of tickets you selected is not available at that moment. In that case, you’ll be moved to the event page, but you will still be able to refresh your browser to try to purchase tickets before others who were not in the waiting room, and/or change the number of tickets you’d like to request. If the quantity you requested is now available, you will proceed directly to the checkout process.

It's also worth noting that the default ticket quantity you'll see upon arriving at the page for BlizzCon is zero 0, so you'll need to make a selection before you click Order Now.

Visit the BlizzCon ticket page http://www.eventbrite.com/e/blizzcon-november-7-8-2014-tickets-10559318205 on Saturday, May 10 at 10 a.m. PDT for a chance to get tickets—good luck!

What purpose does spell pushback still serve in the game? Most players don't enjoy +1-3 sec casts with hunter pet/npc on them.
That explicitly IS its purpose. Also, it's not that long anymore. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459146902009679872
sorry, rephrase, *why do the passive pushback reductions only apply to damage spells, not healing touch, flash heal, etc?
They don't. We removed the passives, and reduced all pushback, game-wide, by 70%. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459150444720177152
In MoP? or are you talking about WoD? I remember recently being in arena and having +1 sec added to a cast by hunter pet.
Yes, I'm talking about Warlords. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459152381800763392

Does Plaguebreaker refresh Necrotic Plague on a sinlge target?
Nothing refreshes Necrotic Plague. Reapplying Necrotic Plague adds a stack instead, including from Plaguebringer. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459128072134852608

Important question on the Pestilence topic: Will it provide damage without diseases up? BB was good for snap threat w/o diseases
Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459129607283691521

Are you at least planning to allow Serpent Sting and black arrow to scale with haste or even that is out of the question?
No, that's not planned. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459401542831857664

Can i get a confimartion please?
Well, you can multidot with Serpent Sting, yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459397486579163137

How is it balanced or reasonable for hunters to have the mobility of a melee while being a ranged DPS?
Because what matters at the end of the day DPS-wise is the damage that they dealt, just as with all specs. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/460601755768606720
But isn't melee vs ranged in general balanced by the fact melee has to move out of range more often, etc?
That's why I said 'more like Melee', not 'exactly like Melee'. They can function differently from everyone else. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/460602419382976513
I fear either they will be like MoP locks -completely OP or their stationary DPS will have to be so poor to balance it
It's definitely a concern that we recognize is legitimate, and we're going to be careful about that. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/460603364695212032

The devs are happy that hunters can do belts every turn while ignoring the debuff, right? 
It was not originally intended that that be possible, but were OK with letting that stay possible. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/460603925469487104

Will anything be done about the reaction window to use Inferno Blast? Maybe lower haste, less proc stacking will be sufficient?
There actually are some special things going on under the hood to make sure that if you just trust it to work in time, it will. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459205690360221696
I'd recommend that even if you feel like it's a problem, that the window is too tight/etc, try it as fast as you can anyway; it'll work Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459205975644196864

I thought surging was going to be better in WoD - it's coefficient is now below even Mists. Change of heart?
Not a change of heart. The big picture is hard for you to see, still. Soothing is similar to Heal; Surging is similar to... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459513567025180672
... FlashHeal-Heal. Or, in other words, Soothing+Surging is similar to FlashHeal. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459513796516528128

Lots of people are having impression that it will be 100% conversion of dps to healing and just as good as MW.
No. If a Mistweaver does 100% Healing, and a Windwalker does 100% DPS, then a Fistweaver will do somewhere around 50%/50%. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459562931621863424
Fistweaving is an official term. Love it
It's widespread enough in the vernacular that we're comfortable using it, especially for more casual discussion as this Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459563871452164097
We're players of this game too, remember. For example, most of us say "BoP", even though it's been "HoP" for years. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459564410118230017

Also, some MW are wondering right now and would like this put to rest. Serpent stance - melee mechanic immune or not?
All Mistweavers, regardless of stance, will count as melee for the purposes of creature abilities that target based on that. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/461017496124805121

Care to elaborate? I am watching history repeat itself. SPriests to become "premium" class in terms of re-gemming expenses.
Most classes have to adjust their gearing focus to swap specs/playstyles; Shadow is far from unique in that. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/460600543086247936

If Shadowstep was put back to baseline, we would need a new filler? BoS is prio picked, but it isn't the solution to the problems.

Even now Elemental is middle-pack among dps specs in SoO. I wonder what drove you to apply the Lightning Bolt nerf for WOD?
Remember that a spec's location on the damage meters in Mists is basically zero indication of where they'll be in Warlords. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/460998541427482625

don't understand why EQ survived ability pruning. Isn't the idea of pruning is to lose useless spells that clunked up the class?

Bake the direct damage into the periodic & make it instant cast.
Yes, that would successfully turn Immolate into Corruption. But why? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/460602094102122496
Did making Corruption instant cast turn it into Agony? Same reason.
No, but giving it Agony-style stacking would. And what reason? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/460605883680976896

I'm sure you guys underestimated how often walorcks need Soulshatter in raids. That spell is really useful. Please, reconsider.
Everything is always under reconsideration. None of our changes are final at this point; beta raid testing will tell us more. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/460618631328841729

since Interrupting shout and pummel share the same CD, why not merge them? BAM gained a button slot
Because that's a huge buff. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/460284328283361280
i don't understand, why? you could just use interrupting shout for every interrupt even if single opponent.
They have different cooldowns. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/460285659127619586

Why u removed Shield wall ? its an iconic ability . and really Warriors dont have more def cds than others dps Wars
We buffed Die by the Sword instead. You don't need two shieldwalls. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/460285368223285249
dbts its 2 min cd and its not enough. thats why shield wall got buffed to 3 min cd instead of 5 min early in the Xpac @Celestalon
...so you're saying that Die By the Sword is better? And got buffed further? Yep... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/460286624811601920

bzrkr stance: each time you take dmg in this stance you gain 1% damage for 15 sec. stacks to 15. 3 sec cd
this is a bad design as it encourages standing in fire to increase dps holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/460588933064032256

Character / Items
Any chance of Isle Bigger Bag achieve going acct wide in 6.0 or am I stuck shunning alts for the rest of MoP?
Not likely - unfortunately a technical limitation. We have a workaround for e.g. "kill 100k players" but that won't work here. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/460087897996414976
So I'm stuck playing a character I don't like because they're further on this awful achievement. Good to know.
I'm not really going to defend that achievement - it's problematic; would be different if it were a FoS like Insane. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/460094071223377920

is the dark shamans transmog being removed from SoO in WoD along with the heirlooms?
No - the Feats of Strength and heirlooms are about it. And Heroic mount droprate reduced when Warlords is released. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/460654245520637952

Taking things away from players in old raids makes your day? There is literally no reason to remove garrosh heirlooms.
99.9% of content is permanent. The stuff we remove or scale back is the extra reward for doing it while current. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/460437287864893440

.Time to put garrosh heirlooms in lfr? They served their purpose in flex and above. Why force people back to old content in WoD?
The Garrosh heirlooms are specifically a reward for doing Flex+ while relevant. They won't be available once Draenor unlocks. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/459861202357592065
Does this mean the items will be removed or just won't be dropped anymore?
The latter - we don't remove items you've earned. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/460496198395121664

Warlords of Draenor Stats
Gems in WoD are secondary stats only, correct? And will bonus armor and spirit gems exist?
Correct. No. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/460285114157527040

PvE
Is it possible that the enrage timers in LFR will be less harsh on LFR groups?
In general, berserk timers shouldn't be a factor in LFR barring mass deaths. I'll take a look at recent Garrosh stats. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/460162781472641024
I'm not sure Berserk even has a purpose in LFR. Maybe in case of geared, unkillable tanks making a wipe last forever?
More or less. Avoids limping slowly towards a wipe that could take 15 minutes as most people lie there unable to act. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/460210065111527424

Any chance of making wands not use a GCD if I accidently right-click the target. Wish I could use wands without interupting GCD.
No, because then wands would be mandatory, and become part of your rotation. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/460606139755790336

What's your opinion of the difficulty spike at the end of Siege? Everything up to Thok were mild with the last 3 being brutal.
On Heroic? The Thok->Siegecrafter jump used to be excessive but hotfixes helped there. It starts ramping right after Nazgrim, IMO. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/460941404080844801

the first few bosses had no curve. it was if you could beat 1, you could beat em all, curve started nazgrim
A curve that you outgear/outskill tends to feel like a flat line. Doesn't mean it is one. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/460963908182765569

PvP
Will you be able to que up for 2s 3s and 5s for skirmishes or just one? Which?
We aren't having 5s skirmishes. No definitive answer on queuing for multiple right now. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/459129195046531072

have u considered solo q for Rated Arena ? arena is great but finding teamates its almost imposible .  2k cr player  ideas? @holinka
We made Arenas cross realm and we're building Group Finder to help players find each other. Players can solo queue for Skirmish. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/460831412531118080

any chance on removing conquest for RBG losses. It's ruined RBG's. Nothing but YOLO groups and unskilled players.
No & I strongly disagree it's "ruined" RBGs. Those "unskilled" players you want to shut out may grow into better players now. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/459534120335335424

Hi there will we ever see the return of elite gear for pvp with increased stats? maybe a ladder for elite gear and one for normal?

with the amount of CC being reduced, what's being done about DKs being able to have ~4 CC avoidance/removal abilities?

Thank god Any chance they'll become proactive instead of reactive?

will season to season item level jumps be reasonable in WoD?
One of the nice benefits of the dual item level design is we can set the PvP ilevels of different tiers more reasonably. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/460831617200578560
Will this in some way also help with the multiple ilvls of pve gear per tier? Like now we have 4 pve vs 2 pvp sets
Yes. So for instance, the lowest tier could get a 40 ilevel boost while the highest tiers gets a 20 ilevel boost. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/460853306873499650
By which I mean lowest/highest PvP tiers. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/460853385168576512

Any chance at locking our specs once we enter a bg so this doesn't happen?Defeats the purpose of roll check http://t.co/qnvYxC6VNJ
Yes, in Warlords, when the queue pops, you will have a role selected. You can only play specs of that role. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/460851303439007744
so you won't be able to choose 2 or all 3 like you can now? You either choose 1 or the other & then are locked into that role?
You can choose 2 or 3, but whatever the system comes back with is what you have to play. If you don't want to heal don't queue heal holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/460854455148109827
Can you be assigned a role that neither of your specs can perform? I don't think anyone should be able to queue for all 3.
you can only select roles that your specced for i.e. If you're enhance & elemental, you can't pick heals holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/461258640083525633

World
Respawn rates on the Timeless isle are just awful. Took my rogue out there and gave up 20 minutes with one tag.
I'd argue that the health scaling was inadequate for the player amount, compounding the problem. We've got better scaling now Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/459209692770615296

Garrisons
Garrisons not account wide currently. Could "found" FOLLOWERS at least be account wide? with exclusions, like achieves
Sometimes you have to choose one or another, and they have different abilities, feels meaningful per-character atm. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/459209337580572672

Can we have a few alliance vs horde skirmishes with npcs.
Would love to do this, we'll see if we have time, maybe later in the expac as a new pvp thing ??? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/459209897549115392
It's the very core of Ashran's kit holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/459210177850257409
Holinka would build his garrison in Ashran if he could. It would be perpetually on fire. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/459210842131529728

So garrisons stuck in Shadowmoon for alliance? That kind of sucks considering perpetual blue-darkness.. Especially for RP..
Aware of this concern, investigating skyboxes. We want it to be a place you feel great about, very conscious of the look. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/459208878282899456
I love it, but could garrisons have a special item/quest/vendor/reward to change the sky? Is that a lot of work?
That's a fun idea! We did weather-changing stones on Timeless Isle, could be something similar. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/459210213359230978
I think it could be neat to tie "cosmetic" ideas to certain buildings or followers. RP reasons if nothing else.
I, too, dream of a world where I can adorn each of my followers with a different fancy hat. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/459211269124284416

Will you be able to invite other players to your Garrison still, or is that idea tossed? 
You definitely will be able to. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/459562381824491520

With garrisons integrated to leveling, will i be forced to quest to unlock it? Or can i LFG level and get it eventually?
You'll get your garrison almost immediately upon arriving in Draenor. You can still develop it even if you LFG to 100. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/459787759083745280
well that sucks...will questing to 100 make it develop faster?
Tons of benefits unlocked via level-up questing, but alternate ways to get them at max level. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/459895332797964288
