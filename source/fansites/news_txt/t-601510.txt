Also, congratulations to all orc who now have very very bugged shoulders http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/shoulderbugs.jpg. We still don't know when it will be fixed, but it should give you enough time to reroll a dwarf and look pretty again

PvP Changes
Two more posts about future PvP changes, this is really starting to look like Blizzard is preparing a big PvP-Balance patch. See also this news about Rogue and Druid balancing

In the next major content patch, the combat rating, resilience, will also reduce the damage dealt by damage over time DoT effects. As it currently stands, each new tier of equipment adds to the amount of damage DoT abilities have, yet that damage is not mitigated through combat ratings found on typical equipment. This change will help ensure that DoT effects do not scale too well compared to other damage mechanics.

The amount of damage reduced will be equal to the critical chance reduction effect that resilience grants.

We do plan to disallow gear swapping other than items you can normally change while in combat once an arena battle has begun.
