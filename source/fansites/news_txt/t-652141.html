3:10 to Thunder Bluff: New Ways of Travel<br>
In the next major content patch we will be adding a few methods of improved transportation to areas of interest while leveling.<br>
<br>
It is time for the denizens of Azeroth to witness the full might of the Horde as they do what they do best: employ goblins to construct zeppelin towers and float players across vast seas using sky boats. That&apos;s right, a new zeppelin route is being added in Thunder Bluff and will transport players to Orgrimmar. Isn&apos;t technology magnificent?<br>
<br>
Also, brought to you by Azeroth&apos;s greatest users of magic, are all new portals coming to Stormwind and Orgrimmar. These portals will transport players directly to the Stair of Destiny at the Dark Portal. Travel is just so much more convenient when it&apos;s instantaneous! Players will then find that a new connecting flight path exists at the Stair of Destiny allowing players new to Outland easy and direct access to the city of Shattrath.<br>
<br>
Keep your seat backs and tray tables in a full upright and locked position, and we hope you continue to enjoy your methods of travel in Azeroth and beyond!</div></div>
