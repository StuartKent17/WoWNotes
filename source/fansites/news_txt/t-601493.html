The Yellow Gems (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=98), Blue Gems (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=96), and Red Gems (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=97) pages have (finally) been updated with the 2.1.0 gems. The Meta Gems (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=35) aren&apos;t updated yet because of a small bug, but everything should be fixed in an hour or two. <br>
