<a name="notes"></a>1. Patch notes
These notes are the official Test Realm notes modified with a few more details on spells changes, they will be updated if the patch deployed on live servers is more recent than the latest PTR build. 
General
Boat and zeppelin vendors and NPCs are are back on duty.
Reduced network latency by disabling the Nagle algorithm.
/timetest is a command that can be run to provide information on game performance. /timetest 0 turns the command off. When the command is issued, the next time a player uses a flight master to travel, certain statistics will be measured and displayed at the end of that flight. All weather effects and spawns are shutdown during the test.
Effects triggered from being critically hit: Many abilities and talents were changed in 2.3.0 to allow them to trigger from critical strikes that occurred while the player benefitting from them was sitting.
Quest givers with blue question marks no longer show up on the minimap.
NPC's who you have completed a quest for will display a question mark on mouseover rather than an exclamation point.
The bank controls for the guildmaster level of a guild is now grayed out. A guildmaster always has full access to a guild bank and this cannot be changed.
A "Withdraw-Repair Only" button has been added to the guild bank controls. If this is set for a guild rank, then that rank cannot actually withdraw funds from the guild bank, but they can still use that daily amount of money for repairs.
