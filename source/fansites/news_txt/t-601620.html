Usk.de (http://www.usk.de/65_Aktuell_geprueft.htm) (same as ESRB/PEGI in Germany) have a page up with the ratings of upcoming games ... Oh, look at the list ! There is a name we already know !<br>

Update : The &quot;GC&quot; part is probably related to the Games Convention (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_Convention) in Leipzig, held from 23 to 26/08. (Thanks to Fisker, he&apos;s smart). Or maybe they&apos;re planning to release WoW on Gamecube *cough*, but personally I&apos;d go for the Games Convention theory. <br>
<br>
Update 2 : Huh ... The Gamecube thing was a joke ... A tauren wouldn&apos;t fit in such a small box anyway.</div></div>
