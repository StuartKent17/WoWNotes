Beast Mastery

Fixed a bug with Spirit Mend https://www.wowdb.com/spells/90361-spirit-mend that caused it to heal for less than intended.




Dungeons and Raids

Uldir

Zul, Reborn

Zul's health has been reduced by 5% on Mythic difficulty.
Developers’ note: Tides of Vengeance removed the Subtlety Rogue passive Shuriken Combo, which was a core part of many guilds’ strategy on this fight. We’re reducing Zul’s health to avoid the update increasing the difficulty of the fight for guilds that were relying on Shuriken Combo.




Items

Heart of Azeroth

Synaptic Spark Capacitor https://www.wowdb.com/spells/280174-synaptic-spark-capacitor damage decreased 32%.

Cooking

Battle for Azeroth flasks and feasts now increase the primary stat for tanks was Stamina.
