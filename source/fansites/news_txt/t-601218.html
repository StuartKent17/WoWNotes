Small information about the next days<br>
The 2.1.0 madness is ending and I can finally start working on the content of the site again, I&apos;ll wait a little before I update the site with all the 2.1.0 changes but you can expect something new soon. ^^<br>
<br>
Patch Notes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=93.0)<br>
<br>
Latest update<br>
The Scale of Sands (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/factions/keepers/scale.xml) page on the official site has been updated with new 2.1.0 rewards, below is the screenshots of exalted rings stats (which are upgraded of the lower ranks). Check the official site for the full list. The Scale of Sands is the faction related to The Battle of Mount Hyjal in the Caverns of Time.<br>
According to Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=band+of+the#z0z), the Bands of Eternal Restorer and Eternal Sage have a 10% Proc rate, while the Eternal Defender has 3%. Eternal Champion is shown as 100% but it&apos;s probably a bug. <br>

<br>
Monsters of Bash&apos;ir Landing can drop epic and rare equipment token, when used with 50 Apexis Shards (Dropping from the same monsters) you can transform them into decent epics and rares items.<br>
<br>

<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/siteImages/images/news/210/ogrila/depleted.jpg<br>
<br>
In addition, there is an altar in the Bash&apos;ir landing area where you can trade Apexis Shards for flasks (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/210/ogrila/flask.jpg). The Apexis Shards are a fairly common drop off any of the Ethereals in the area.<br>
Unstable Flask of the Bandit : +20 Agi +40 AP +30 Sta<br>
Unstable Flask of the Beasts : +20 Agi +20 Str +30 Sta<br>
Unstable Flask of the Elder : +20 Int +8 MP5 +30 Sta<br>
Unstable Flask of the Physician : +20 Int +44 Healing +30 Sta<br>
Unstable Flask of the Soldier : +20 Crit Rating +20 Str +30 Sta<br>
Unstable Flask of the Sorcerer : +20 Int +23 Spl Dmg +30 Sta<br>
<br>
You can summon bosses in Bash&apos;ir landing to level your reputation (Basicaly like the Silithus ones). They can drop rare loots.<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/siteImages/images/news/210/ogrila/bossloot.jpg<br>
<br>
After a few kills of these bosses, you should be able to get a Mark of the Nexus King, unlocking a new quest (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/210/ogrila/quest_bade.jpg) (rewarded with Heroic Badges)<br>
Simple quest if you can stealth in, it&apos;s directly to the left in the room after Pandemonius. An ambassador pops out and says &apos;There&apos;s a being of immense power within these tombs&apos;.<br>
Then you can go back to Blade&apos;s Edge Mountains and get your reward.<br>
<br>
3 Quests are following up. One is a repeatable quest to turn in 5 keys, to summon a Bash&apos;ir boss.<br>
The second is for &quot;The second stasis chamber, should you choose to do so!&quot;, and it requires another Mark of the Nexus-Kings.<br>
You get a key (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/210/ogrila/) to open another stasis chamber to encounter ... Yor, Void Hound of Shaffar ! (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/210/ogrila/boss_mana.jpg). <br>

Was killed by a GM. But who cares as long as he gives epix !<br>

<br>
Supremus, second boss of the Black Temple, has been killed on the PTR by Death and Taxes (http://www.dtguilds.com/) and Vis Maior (http://www.vismaior.org/) and .... Tigole, who death touched him. But once again, we&apos;ve got loots ! They obviously killed Naj&apos;entus on the way and both Supremus and his loots have been added to the BT Loots compilation (which has been slightly modified to look nicer)<br>

Attunement<br>
We can suppose that the attunement questline will be started by Akama in Shadowmoon Valley. We can also supose that you will have to do quests for Illidan himself, to prove your allegiance to him and enter the Black Temple.<br>
You will probably have to kill Al&apos;ar (Phoenix of the Tempest Keep) and complete Serpentshrine Cavern to free Olum.<br>
patch.mpq - Creature/Illidan/BTPRLUDE_Illidan02.wav (After Akama said that Kael&apos;thas was betraying Illidan)<br>
I do not sense lies in your voice Akama. That Kael&apos;thas would betray me doesn&apos;t come as a big surprise, I&apos;m not as oblivious as some would think. That one of your own was involved with him puts your loyalty into question.<br>
patch.mpq - Creature/Illidan/BTPRLUDE_Illidan03.wav (Killing Al&apos;ar to show your allegiance)<br>
Send your Ashtongues into Tempest Keep and slay his most priced possession : The Phoenix Known as Al&apos;ar, I must know that you are not on his side. Do not think of betraying me broken, we both knows who owns your soul.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Northrend<br>
In the patch .MPQ file, there are a few terrain models, that you might have already seen. As you can see they&apos;re in the Expansion02 directory, which is quite unusual for not yet released content (most of it is in the same directory as the normal content). Obviously, the Expansion01 directory only contains Burning Crusade files. <br>
&quot;Howling Fjord (http://www.wowwiki.com/Howling_Fjord)&quot; is a region located in south-eastern Northrend. Men who were left behind by Arthas have setup the Valgarde outpost here. <br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/siteImages/images/news/210/northrend_mws.jpg<br>
<br>
There is also something else, Northrend loots. Two files of the patch are already labeled as loots from Northrend (shield_northrend_d_01.m2 and sword_1h_northrend_c_01.m2). There are multiple skins for each one of them.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/siteImages/images/news/210/northrend_loots_small.jpg (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/210/northrend_loots.jpg)<br>
<br>
This leave us with one question : Why Northrend instead of the Emerald Dream ? Some of the map files of the Emerald Dream have been in the .mpq files for ever ! <br>
There is a simple awnser to this : Why not both ? You can enter the Emerald Dream (http://www.wowwiki.com/Emerald_Dream) from 5 portals, 4 of them are already known (Ashenvale / Felwood / Hinterlands / Feralas) but the last one is in ... Northrend ! Crystalsong Forest (http://www.wowwiki.com/Crystalsong_Forest) exactly.<br>
<br>
This could lead to the release of an expansion scheduled as Burning Crusade, a new continent with an inaccessible final boss (Illidan in Burning Crusade, Arthas in the case of Northrend), but with something to keep you busy while the new dungeon is added (Emerald Dream).<br>
