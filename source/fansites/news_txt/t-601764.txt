Question
And does that include toning down Stormherald swinging, Mortal Strike Warriors, who are dominating GROUP PvP? That's where balance is supposed to be met, right? 

Answer
Yes, one of the changes is a reduction to the mace spec stun proc rate. It should still be as good as the other specs, just not clearly the favorite. 

Question
Is it acceptable to you, the game developers, where Warlocks are?

Answer
Nope. Although I could probably say that to varying degree about any class depending on what particular part of the game you're talking about. Patch 2.2 has the resilience change for starters, and patch 2.3 has more changes, including improvements to a lot of the things that were discussed at blizzcon.

This also means that the 2.3 will probably be a huge patch like what the 2.1 was, with tons of improvements for each class. as well with Guild banks and Zul'aman 

RSS feed bugs
Lately I've been getting a bunch of mails saying that the RSS feed isn't updating properly. To be honest I really don't know why people are experiencing some bugs, but the most likely reason is a wrong RSS feed URL. The RSS feed for latest news from the homepage is this one http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?type=rss;action=.xml;board=2.0;sa=news;

If you add a RSS feed from the site while you're not on the homepage like on the news forums, you'll get the feed from this forum, but not the real news feed. Let me know if you're still experiencing problems after you doubletriple-checked the URL.
