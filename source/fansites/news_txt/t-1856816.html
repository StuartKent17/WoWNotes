Blue Tweets<br>
Racials<br>
Did they forget to buff Touch of the Grave? Its still doing the same amount of damage it was before the patch.<br>
We&apos;ll look into it. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/638778180967473152))<br>
<br>
Bugs<br>
what&apos;s up with bladestorm? Animation is borked since 6.2.2. Dwarf. Spins once and then stops moving at all until it&apos;s complete.<br>
Thanks, I&apos;ll pass it on. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/638784535212261376))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
why would you nerf anything when it comes to teams that qualified already on a different state of the game? makes no sens<br>
As stated before, we will do what we feel is right for the game but try to accomodate timing when possible. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/636340716348702721))<br>
Good players adapt and overcome to shifts in a game&apos;s meta. This is the nature of esports. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/636340824276512768))<br>
<br>
to change the game a lot after the qualifiers for regionals,all the teams are locked and vulnerable to nerfs<br>
I can&apos;t speak for other games. We are only concerned about doing what is best for World of Warcraft. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/636356378626363392))<br>
Last year there was a new patch before regional&apos;s &amp; I believe they played on the old? #Blizzcon<br>
Incorrect. We stayed on Mists for Blizzcon. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/636564473071857665))<br>
you are mistaking Regionals for Blizzcon. 6.0 came out after regionals, before Blizzcon. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/636571169009700865))<br>
<br>
<br>
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Developer Communication<br>
but having something like that even once every few weeks makes a huge difference.<br>
I don&apos;t know that I agree. On WoW, it might make the paladins happy but then the shaman wondered when it was &quot;their turn.&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/635965210180718593))<br>
I can see that issue. I&apos;d still rather &apos;somebody&apos; got a turn than nobody. My view may not be consistent with forums overall<br>
If you have say 20 devs engaging it may not be an issue. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/635967340035764224))<br>
And I have been at two of the largest studios out there, which couldn&apos;t produce 20. But I can dream! (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/635967603236671488))<br>

Poll - Flying Achievement<br>
Now that flying is here, it is time to see how many of you are ready to fly! We last looked at this (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5089-Armory-Stats-Flying-Achievements-August-14-Hotfixes-Blue-Tweets-HS-TGT-Cards) a few weeks ago and it was a pretty even split.<br>
<br>
Stats on the overall number of players that have earned the achievement are coming within the next week or so.<br>
