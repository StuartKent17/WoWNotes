I didn't notice them at first but the first PTR build of Patch 3.2 was shipped with a few models of new armors. I will not claim that they are Tier 9 armors because the naming scheme of the model files was changed but it wouldn't be surprising if it was indeed the T9 models. 

Only the Plate version for the alliance is available for the moment. I know for sure that they're sets for different classes because the textures are clearly named after each class, see the file list
