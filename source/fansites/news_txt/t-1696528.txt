Armory Stats - Garrison Followers
We are taking a look at an often requested topic, garrison stats. Unfortunately the Battle.Net API doesn't give us any garrison specific information, so all we can look at is achievements. You can always give this post a thumbs up  to show your interest in having garrison data in the API though!

We are continuing with follower data today, looking at 2.7 million players and 4.4 million characters. Keep in mind that the 20 x Level 100 Follower  achievement unlocks the War Mill / Bunker blueprints.

Choluna and Thisalee Crow Followers
QA has finished testing a hotfix that will provide the Choluna or Thisalee Crow follower NPC to players who previously completed the quest "Primal Fury". If you had completed the quest last week and didn't receive the follower, you should receive the follower as soon as you login once realms have been restarted. Restarts for US realms are currently scheduled for tomorrow at 5am PST. I'm happy to announce that just like any other follower, Choluna and Thisalee Crow have a chance to roll as rare or epic when you recruit them.

Players who have not yet completed Primal Fury will receive Choluna or Thisalee Crow as soon as they complete the quest, in addition to the other rewards.

Apologies for any inconvenience caused over the last week. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Amplify Magic doesn't affect glyph of regenerative ice heals or the cold snap heal. Have reported this for about a month.
This is intended. % heals aren't increased. holinka

how do you see Seraphim ever being viable again after this tier when it doesn't scale?
This is a common misconception. It totally does scale. Check out Theck's theorycrafting. Static ratings don't "not scale". Celestalon 

Character / Items
With the new heirloom tab include BoA items, such as those from Archeology in Pandaria?
We feel like it would muddy the waters of the system. The Heirloom tab is only for items that scale with character level. WarcraftDevs 

PvE
Frustrating in progression wipes to wait for 3 minute CD's. Any chance we can get those to reset on wipe ?
This is definitely a topic of discussion on our end. Appreciate the feedback! WarcraftDevs 

PvP
Have you realised that you have basically killed any form of competitive PvP?
Quite the contrary, I expect this year to be one of the best for competitive PvP. Stay tuned! holinka 

hello friend, I am curious as to if challenger/rival/duelist/gladiator titles are still available from 5v5, I mever saw a blue post
Hello friend. Those titles will only be given out in the 3v3 bracket this season. WarcraftDevs 

Dev Communication
Just want'd to offer a late thank you for the communication you did with players while working for blizzard. Appreciated 
Talking to players is one of the most rewarding parts of my job. Wish more devs and their managers understood that. Ghostcrawler
Please pass this on to he seems to have a phobia of talking to the PvP community
Team has gone in a different direction with communication then when I originally joined Twitter. holinka 
Are we going back to BC era of communication? I really really hope not. Even on the forums you guys are quiet now. 

What happened?
just a lot of scrutiny over me using my personal Twitter as a personal Twitter account holinka 
There is some understandable frustration with the current lack of communication. Blizzard seems to have stopped the Dev twitter communication model but its not clear what the new model is.

That's great, but there is nothing on the forums. The least people ask for is a reply, even if it's "We're doing nothing yet"
Patch notes are a central location for people to find out about future changes. Don't want news spread throughout forum threads. holinka
