The site to signup for the Friend &amp; Family Alpha (https://beta.worldofwarcraft.com/expansion/) is available and I guess we can consider that the alpha officialy started. As a reminder this is restricted to Blizzard&apos;s employees and their friends/family and it&apos;s not public in any way, you won&apos;t get any mail related to this phase of the beta.<br>
