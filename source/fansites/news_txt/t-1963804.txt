Legion - Mana Cost Indicator
In Legion, the default UI will now visually show you how much mana the spell you are casting will cost, similar to how shields show up on the health bar.

Mana Tap talent looks exactly like Soulburn Haunt, Improved Soulfire 4.0. An obligatory buff to maintain.
Do you think talents are a good place for gameplay styles that some people enjoy and some people don't? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/704579767786299392

I'm gonna ask you a question anyway.Can hunters please tame rams? Something for my hunter to have along side his mount.
Usually we try to add models that have had uprezzes these days, maybe someday Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704942719215468544
Good to know. When I caught a glimpse of the PvP Ram, my Dwarf-o-meter went off and I wanted to see more of that high-rez glory.
Yaks are close! And fuzzy. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704943141976195072

Character / Items
when will blizz fix the undead model and by model I mean scaling of gear or how it looks on Undead vs other race. #SHOULDERSRSOSMALLSADFACE
are you seriously a player playing a warcraft game complaining that your shoulders are too small Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704956236567949312
on Undead, yes! On everyone else, no! Plate gear on undead looks so "spread out" and not compact.
One of them definitely hangs off of the shoulder a bit, thanks for the feedback. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704956840128356352

will T18 set bonuses be adjusted once the Legion prepatch drops? Several modify talents that won't exist or will have moved
Yes. The set bonuses for Tier 18 will be adjusted. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705190332879630337

PvP
What is AV/Wintergrasp lasted an hour or two? You'd talk with the peeps.
Ashran was a Good Experiment. Drove PvP forward, got feedback, glad we did it. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704948022283739138
And I'm not sure this is 100% true, I loved 48 hour AV Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704948408893743105

The amount of honor per level increases every 10 levels. At the moment, going from 1-50 takes 50,000 honor. 1/2 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705482012723818496
Leveling through the honor system is a point of emphasis for us right now, so we are open to feedback! 2/2 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705482094454026240

Lore
Saw General Tiras'alan in the Paladin Class Hall during an alpha Stream. Think he died during the Theramore Bombing, no?
Sounds like we have an imposter in our midst... Thanks for the heads up! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705183220225040384

Misc
or do the Devs want to make wow into a different game? What's the deal here?
Games evolve with time, the challenge is evolving with the userbase. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704943426471645186


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
then again the group finder makes it as trivial to find random group and it works. I am not getting you entirely here.
The point of group content is to work together as a group. Excellent matchmaking works against that because it's so easy to bail. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/706924287878279168
As a player, sure it's easier if you don't have to communicate and just hit a button to find another group. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/706924365691035648
But is that healthy in the long run? Why have a multiplayer game if everyone plays it as a single-player game, you know? OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/706924465037266944

Was there originally a plan for Crystalsong Forest in WOTLK? Seems to desolate...
I think it was Dalaran, which was in that zone, being too much of a resource hog. Was long ago - I may be misremembering. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/706924965099012096
