Patch 8.1.5 - Tides of Vengeance Content Update Notes
Allied Races - Kul Tiran Humans and Zandalari Trolls Now Available
Take the final steps to bring new comrades into your faction. Level 120 players who wish to create a Kul Tiran will need to reach Exalted with Proudmoore Admiralty and earn the achievements A Nation United and Tides of Vengeance. Those wanting to create a Zandalari character must be level 120, reach Exalted with Zandalari Empire and earn the Zandalar Forever! and Tides of Vengeance achievements. Once you complete the requirements, visit the Alliance embassy in Stormwind or Horde embassy in Orgrimmar to begin a quest chain to recruit these new Allied races.

Kul Tiras was founded by fearless explorers who sailed uncharted waters in search of adventure. As a key member of the Alliance of Lordaeron, the Kul Tiran navy dominated the seas of Azeroth with its legendary fleet.

The Zandalari are a proud people whose origins date back to the early days of Azeroth's history. Their fierce warriors ride dinosaurs into battle, and they possess one of the most formidable naval fleets in the known world.

Leveling your new Kul Tiran or Zandalari from 20 to 110 will earn you a unique cosmetic Heritage Armor set. You’ll also unlock a new mount—the Kul Tiran Charger or Zandalari Direhorn—for your collection at character creation.

We have increased the effect of the Sliver by 6% and the Prism by 15% to offset this change in behavior.

Destruction

During Battle for Azeroth Season 1, we identified that Warlocks were taking too much damage from physical sources during PvP. We remedied this by adding a new PvP talent, Demon Armor, which increased their physical mitigation to match characters wearing Plate Armor. As we've been monitoring Season 2, we feel that the armor increase caused Warlocks to become too tanky in the current meta.
