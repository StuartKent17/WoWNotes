Raids and Dungeons
Loot Buff for Call to Arms

Savage Satchel of Cooperation , awarded for completing a class role that's in demand through Dungeon Finder or Raid Finder received a boost to its contents.

Hellfire Citadel
Xhul'horac

Omnus's Singularity damage can now be reduced by damage reduction effects on Raid Finder difficulty.

Annihilator should no longer have a chance to trigger its on hit effect on targets that are above level 63.
Fixed an issue where Rancorbite Mail Agility 4-piece set bonus was not correctly scaling its damage down in Timewalking dungeons.



Blue Tweets
Mounts
That moose mount is great. Please say it can fly. Always wanted a flying moose.
Yea it can! The feet glow with blue-green dream dust Muffinus 


  

PvP
Another reminder that I make no announcements & answer no questions about WoW on twitter. Be wary of malicious fake accounts trolling you. holinka 

been doing alot of BGs lately and I gotta say Horde has majorly bought into a defeatist "groupthink". They don't even try anymore.
The groupthink problem is a tremendous challenge holinka 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Classes
specifically ret I was getting tuned constantly why did it need such an overhaul? What was the mindset there?D
Low skill ceiling. There wasn't a way to really get better by playing more, which was always going to keep their dps down. OccupyGStreet 

PvE
everyone thinks sun well wasn't planned and was a band-aid. Can you confirm it was part of the original BC plans or not?
I think it was added when LK ended up taking longer. I may be wrong. I don't trust my memory on that. OccupyGStreet 


World Firsts Timeline
Manaflask  released a nice feature that shows off the history of world firsts, with interviews and other articles about older raids.
