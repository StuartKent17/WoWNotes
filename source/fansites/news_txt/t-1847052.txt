Blizzcon Digital Bonuses Code
The Digital Bonuses Codes went out to Blizzcon ticket holders today. These codes give you a Virtual Ticket, access to In-Game goodies, and the online sale. So far, we know that Murkidan http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/10322-murkidan will be one of the in-game http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/85009-dwarf-gronnling rewards.

Patch 6.2 Hotfixes - August 17
Users on the forum noted this change this weekend, mentioning getting 500 - 600 gold per bag http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1844851-Savage-Satchel-of-Cooperation?p=35621521&viewfull=1#post35621521.
Raids and Dungeons
Loot Buff for Call to Arms

Savage Satchel of Cooperation http://www.wowdb.com/items/128803-savage-satchel-of-cooperation, awarded for completing a class role that's in demand through Dungeon Finder or Raid Finder received a boost to its contents.

Increased the amount of gold awarded by over 200%!
The satchel now has a chance for additional Baleful tokens, Empowered Apexis Fragment http://www.wowdb.com/items/128225-empowered-apexis-fragment, and Medallion of the Legion http://www.wowdb.com/items/128315-medallion-of-the-legion.


Hellfire Citadel
Xhul'horac

Omnus's Singularity damage can now be reduced by damage reduction effects on Raid Finder difficulty.


Items

Annihilator should no longer have a chance to trigger its on hit effect on targets that are above level 63.
Fixed an issue where Rancorbite Mail Agility 4-piece set bonus was not correctly scaling its damage down in Timewalking dungeons.

Another reminder that I make no announcements & answer no questions about WoW on twitter. Be wary of malicious fake accounts trolling you. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/631950750050988032

been doing alot of BGs lately and I gotta say Horde has majorly bought into a defeatist "groupthink". They don't even try anymore.
The groupthink problem is a tremendous challenge holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/631631845101211648


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Classes
specifically ret I was getting tuned constantly why did it need such an overhaul? What was the mindset there?D
Low skill ceiling. There wasn't a way to really get better by playing more, which was always going to keep their dps down. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/623133763233447936

PvE
everyone thinks sun well wasn't planned and was a band-aid. Can you confirm it was part of the original BC plans or not?
I think it was added when LK ended up taking longer. I may be wrong. I don't trust my memory on that. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/626544972137762816
