Item Level Boost Wednesday<br>
Bashiok let us know that the item level boost is expected to go out Wednesday. Keep in mind that isn&apos;t a guarantee. <br>

<br>
Blizzard&apos;s logic for deploying this on a Wednesday instead of a Tuesday shows how out of touch with the game you guys are.<br>
The logic is its not done yet, and providing lots of heads up let&apos;s people make the right choices. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578040982664413184))<br>
Make sure something is done and ready to go THEN announce it, instead of the other way around.. you can lawyer talk -- cont.<br>
Giving people advanced warning isn&apos;t anything but positive. You know it&apos;s coming, so you can make the right choices. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578041446827081728))<br>
Thanks for the headsup. That said, really poor communication about the intended timeframe for this.<br>
We said next week, and we intended for it to be sometime this week. Doesn&apos;t matter when it&apos;s applied. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578041585251659776))<br>
Except to the people who raid on Tuesday, I suppose.<br>
Why? (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578041870598582272))<br>
Kinda does matter to people raiding tonight...<br>
Shouldn&apos;t really. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578042008473747456))<br>
Oh you&apos;re being serious, so you actually are crying over 5 iLevels. Gotcha.<br>
Think his point is it&apos;s more the principal of the thing than ilvls. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578046622342361088))<br>
Ideally it could have been out this morning. It wasn&apos;t. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578046947161849856))<br>
For one week, on a few item levels. I think it&apos;s probably fine. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578047793949859840))<br>
Awful communication as well as releasing for European reset day &amp; screwing over the United States in the process.<br>
We&apos;re releasing when it&apos;s done. It&apos;s a somewhat complex change. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578046947161849856))<br>
any eta on the time this will be live tomorrow?<br>
No. When it&apos;s ready. I would personally suspect afternoon. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578047423848718336))<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
Classes<br>
I don&apos;t think some passives should be baked into active abilities. It hides how a spec works and newbies constanly overlook it<br>
This is definitely a point of confusion for some players that we will be taking a hard look at changing. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/575385560832811009))<br>

Moonkin Wild Charge (Disengage) not usable out of combat. Design or oversight?<br>
Original design. It was an oversight not to change this when we changed Disengage. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/575385273091026945))<br>

Art<br>
Hey lots of helms that cover the face are now broken on human females because of the 6.1 changes. Any plans to fix it?<br>
Art is constantly looking to improve helm fitting. Bug reports with specific examples/screenshots if possible always welcome. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/575431807904043008))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Regardless, may we assume that you&apos;ve seen the mountains of criticism regarding the Ashran changes? You discussing more changes?<br>
I made a forum post elaborating on the reasons for the change and our thoughts on the matter have not changed. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574915532626919424))<br>
<br>
Some feedback about bag space (some pvp related) http://t.co/axl10JB1DQ<br>
Yea we tried to reduce the amount of items you get from ashran. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574926136620118016))<br>
<br>
Constructive feedback on how to get more people into pvp. Really a great thread (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16542424647?page=1). <br>
I certainly agree personally with the premise that nurturing &quot;bad&quot; players is important for a game overall (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575102845214556160))<br>
<br>
Why is Arcane Power is dispellable and paladin&apos;s wings are not? I remember them being dispellable.<br>
Avenging Wrath used to be dispellable, but dispelling it was too punishing. No promises, but we can discuss the same for AP. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/575384986213183488))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
Is there a reason stopped answering questions and just used as an announcer of hotfixes/changes now?<br>
We haven&apos;t stopped and we&apos;re gathering a bunch right now. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/575367713087877120))<br>
<br>
Okay can you tell us who Gul&apos;dan&apos;s voice actor is? Because that dude is amazing.<br>
Troy Baker! He&apos;s great isn&apos;t he? Great to work with, too! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/575343611321020416))<br>
<br>
Thanks for the feedback and for presenting it reasonably. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/570775057150009344))<br>
While his initial tweet could use some work, I don&apos;t think your sarcasm is going to work for you in the long run.<br>
it wasn&apos;t sarcasm. It was genuine thanks. His tweet was good feedback. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574907099945177089))<br>
Your answers are either terrible and sarcastic or twitter sucks as a way to communicate with you.<br>
Twitter isn&apos;t a great for communicating tone. I&apos;m surprised people think this tweet is bad. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574907544960811008))<br>
Also to be fair the person I responded to was never unreasonable. Third parties decided it was sarcasm. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574911933272363008))<br>
Ever think that it might be time to give up twitter completely? Not saying you should, nor would I feel compelled to. Just asking.<br>
No because 99% of people on here are great (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574922024566583296))<br>
True story. We don&apos;t let the few bad eggs get us down. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/574922357220864002))<br>
<br>
Apparently this is a mean spirited sarcastic tweet on my part. If this is the worst I ever do I&apos;m succeeding. http://t.co/hUEE1u6YxK (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574909794236002304))<br>
if you think a tweet is the worst you do, try Ashran ;-)<br>
oh zing (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575004227283496960))<br>

Guild Wars 2 is getting some camera improvements in this week&apos;s patch. Among the changes are first person mode and a new collision detection system. You can see an example of how the changes affect your view here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3t4iDDj-qw&amp;t=376). Running past trees or other small things no longer zooms your camera in all the way.<br>
