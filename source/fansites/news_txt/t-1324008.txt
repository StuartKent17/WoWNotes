Overview - When the fight begins, Norushen seals all players inside a Quarantine Zone and extracts a portion of each player's corruption to form an Amalgam of Corruption. The object of the encounter is to destroy this creature. Players must reduce their personal level of Corruption in order to inflict full damage to the Amalgam. Players can accomplish this by interacting with the nodes of Purifying Light that active around the room, which will pull them into another phase where they must face a role-specific challenge. Overcoming this challenge will Purify the player and allow them to inflict full damage to the Amalgam.

<img src="" title="Important" /> Corruption  - Players start the encounter with 75 points of Corruption. The more corrupt a player is the less damage they will inflict to the Amalgam of Corruption.
Purified  - Players who reach 0 Corruption become Purified. Healers who are purified gain bonus healing.
Quarantine Measures - If the Amalgam of Corruption proves too dangerous Norushen will have no choice but to activate the zone's safety measures and destroy all life within.

<img src="" title="Tank" /> Amalgam of Corruption - 

<img src="" title="Tank" /> Unleashed Anger  - The Amalgam slashes at its current tank target, inflicting 320,000 Physical damage.
<img src="" title="Tank" /> Self Doubt  - The Amalgam inflicts doubt on its current tank target. Self Doubt increases the damage of Unleashed Anger by 50% per application.
<img src="" title="Deadly" /> Blind Hatred  - The Amalgam creates a zone of corruption that extends outward and slowly turns in place. All players caught in the path of the corruption suffer 120,000 Shadow damage every second.
<img src="" title="Deadly" /> Fusion  - Every Expelled Corruption that reaches the Amalgam of Corruption will increase the damage the Amalgam inflicts by 8% for 15 sec.
<img src="" title="Healer" /> Icy Fear  - The Amalgam inflicts 60,000 Frost damage to all players every 3 sec. This damage increases as the Amalgam loses health.
<img src="" title="Important" /> Frayed  - When the Amalgam reaches 50% health remaining, and for every 10% health lost thereafter, the Amalgam spawns an Unleashed Manifestation of Corruption.

<img src="" title="Important" /> Look Within  - Players can interact with Purifying Light to Look Within. Doing so transports the player to their own realm where they face a personal challenge based on their role. Successfully completing the challenge will return the player to the normal realm with zero Corruption.

<img src="" title="Dps" /> Test of Serenity  - Players of the DPS role face the Test of Serenity. To complete this challenge, players must defeat the elements of corruption present. Whenever one of these elements of corruption is defeated, it will be unleashed into the normal realm. 
Failure to complete the challenge will unleash all remaining elements of corruption to the normal realm at once.

Manifestation of Corruption - These sha creatures repeatedly cast Tear Reality, which inflict Shadow damage to all enemies in a cone in front of the caster.
Essence of Corruption - These lesser sha creatures repeatedly cast Expel Corruption, which fires a ball of corrupted energies in a straight line, dealing 80,000 Shadow damage to anyone it strikes.

<img src="" title="Healer" /> Test of Reliance  - Players of the Healer role face the Test of Reliance. To complete this challenge, players must defeat a Greater Corruption. Healers are aided by several allies while Looking Within. Failure to complete the challenge will unleash the Greater Corruption to the normal. Success reveals an orb of purifying light that will cleanse the player of all corruption.

Greater Corruption

Disheartening Laugh - Inflicts 44,000 Shadow damage to all enemies.
Pit of Despair - Inflicts 80,000 Shadow damage every second to all enemies within the area.

<img src="" title="Tank" /> Test of Confidence  - Players of the Tank role face the Test of Confidence. To complete this challenge, the tank must survive for 60 sec against a Titanic Corruption. Success returns the player to the normal realm with zero corruption.

Titanic Corruption

Titanic Smash  - Inflicts 400,000 Shadow damage to anyone in a cone in front of the caster.
Corruption  - Every successful strike received from the Titanic Corruption inflicts the victim with a stack of Corruption, inflicting 8,000 Shadow damage per application every second.
<img src="" title="Interruptable" /> Hurl Corruption  - The caster hurls a ball of corruption at their target, inflicting 240,000 Shadow damage.
<img src="" title="Deadly" /> Burst of Corruption  - Inflicts 160,000 Shadow damage to all enemies.
Piercing Corruption  - Inflicts 320,000 Physical damage to the target. This attack cannot be absorbed.



<img src="" title="Important" /> Unleashed Corruption - Whenever players successfully defeat an element of corruption during the Test of Serenity it will be unleashed in the normal realm.

Unleashed Manifestation of Corruption 

Tear Reality  - Inflicts Shadow damage to all enemies in a cone in front of the caster.
Burst of Anger  - Inflicts 40,000 Shadow damage to all players within the Quarantine Zone.
<img src="" title="Important" /> Residual Corruption  - When an Unleashed Manifestation of Corruption dies it leaves behind a small amount of corruption that will periodically inflict 72,000 Shadow damage to all players in the Quarantine Zone until it is picked up. Players are unable to pick up the Residual Corruption unless they have removed sufficient corruption of their own first. In LFR, Flexible, and Normal difficulties, Residual Corruption gives the player 25 Corruption. In Heroic difficulties, Residual Corruption gives the player 30 Corruption.

Unleashed Essence of Corruption 

Expel Corruption  - A ball of corrupted energy travels outward from the caster, inflicting 80,000 Shadow damage to the first enemy in its path. Every Expelled Corruption that reaches the Amalgam of Corruption will increase the damage the Amalgam inflicts by 8% for 15 sec. In Heroic difficulties, Expelled Corruption gives the victim 0 corruption.

Pressing the Attack: Assault Mode - The Iron Juggernaut is freely mobile while in Assault mode.

Borer Drill  - The Iron Juggernaut bores its drill arm into the ground, causing the earth to crack and shatter. This effect ripples out into many directions, inflicting 60,000 Physical damage to those caught within its effect.
Laser Burn  - The Iron Juggernaut's tail cannon now focuses briefly on random players. Inflicts 137,500 Fire damage to random players, and sears their flesh for an additional 75,000 Fire damage every 2 seconds.
Mortar Cannon - The Iron Juggernaut's top cannon launches shrapnel and explosives at a random player, inflicting 200,000 Fire damage to enemies within 8 yards of the blast.
Crawler Mines - The Iron Juggernaut releases several Crawler Mines that scurry in the direction of random players, burying themselves partially into the ground. Once they burrow, they begin a detonation sequence. At the end of the sequence, they will detonate for 240,000 Physical damage to all players. A particularly brave player may stomp a burrowed Mine into the ground, stifling the explosion but causing a localized detonation at their feet. This explosion inflicts 1,000,000 Physical damage and knocks the player high into the air.
<img src="" title="Heroic" /> Ricochet  - The Iron Juggernaut launches the sawblade from its arm, causing 0 Physical damage to players that come into contact with the blade as it whirls and ricochets from player to player.
<img src="" title="Tank" /> Flame Vents  - The Iron Juggernaut emits flame from its frontal vents, inflicting 240,000 Fire damage in a frontal cone. This effect applies Ignite Armor, which increases damage taken by Fire effects by 10% sears the target's flesh for for 30,000 damage every 1 second. This effect stacks.

Breaking the Defense: Siege Mode - The Iron Juggernaut plants itself in its current position, boring deep into the ground. It will no longer focus on a single target. During Siege mode, the Iron Juggernaut releases crawler mines at an increased rate.

Seismic Activity  - The Iron Juggernaut's drills deep into the earth, causing a violent earthquake. This earthquake inflicts 32,000 Nature damage every 1 second to all players. The seismic activity causes intermittent Shock Pulses.

Shock Pulse  - Shock Pulse causes a wave of force that knocks players back significantly.

Demolisher Cannons  - The shoulder-mounted turrets of the Iron Juggernaut fire high into the sky over random players, inflicting 120,000 Fire damage to players within 6 yards of each blast.
Cutter Laser  - The Iron Juggernaut's tail cannon now traces the ground as it chases each target. The laser inflicts 140,000 Fire damage every 1 sec to players with which it comes into contact.
Explosive Tar - The Iron Juggernaut spews tar in all directions. Standing in tar deals 16,000 Nature damage every 1 second and reduces movement speed by 30%. If a tar puddle comes into contact with the flames of the cutter laser, the puddle will explode, inflicting 160,000 Fire damage to all players.
<img src="" title="Heroic" /> <img src="" title="Deadly" /> Mortar Barrage - The Iron Juggernaut's top cannon rapidly fires numerous Mortar Blasts towards one of the Iron Juggernaut's sides, dealing 280,000 Fire damage to players within 15 yards of each blast.

Patch 5.4 - Celestial Tournament Testing
New adjustments and fixes have been applied to the Celestial Tournament on the PTR and we're seeking your **feedback. If you're a seasoned veteran of Pet Battles and have a robust selection of level 25 pets, head on over and speak to Master Li on the Timeless Isle. Once in the scenario, Emperor Shaohao will be your guide and instruct you on what you will need to accomplish.

As with anything still in development, please keep your comments constructive when providing us with feedback. Regardless of the extent of your experiences in Pet Battles, your thoughts are valuable to us and we look forward to hearing from you!

**Note: To be safe, we recommend you place your pets in a cage as many as you can and leave them in your bags before transferring to the PTR to avoid potential issues. There are still a few quirks with the character transfer process which we’re working on correcting, but may affect which pets will be on your PTR character once it arrives.

You REALLY should warn people that they will be facing off against 13 PETS in this tournament each day.
It's a weekly event, not daily.

I can completely understand why you have set the min amount of pets to even qualify for this, but it is likely someone is going to run through 15-20 pets in this due to the "NO HEALING' debuff you have while in this scenario.
You're catching on! And yes, it's going to be a challenge and tough to defeat so having a solid list of level 25 pets is recommended. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Patch 5.4 Frost Mastery
The feedback from the community has been extremely vital to getting this new Mastery working well. Iteration is key to us, and Icicles are a perfect example of that. 

Overall, we like the core concept of Icicles, and are refining things at this point. The next or perhaps one after that PTR build will include several revisions. The Frostbolt debuff is now “baked in” meaning the debuff no longer increases damage taken, but the spells it modified now do more baseline damage, and Waterbolt no longer generates Icicles with Mastery now increasing Waterbolt’s damage directly. We’re also speeding up the rate at which Icicles launch when triggered by Ice Lance, as well as a few other tweaks.

We look forward to more feedback from testing that next iteration on it. Thanks all. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Patch 5.4 Mana Tea Changes Reverted
After a lot of heavy discussion, we've decided not to go ahead with the Mana Tea nerfs for now. As many of you have pointed out and we’re keenly aware, solving the issues with Mistweavers’ mana regen is not a small task, and while we’re not happy with how things are working currently, it’s just a bigger problem than we’re comfortable trying to solve in 5.4. We’ll be revisiting the issue in the future.

Note: There is a possibility that the next PTR build will have a number of other changes that we were considering, but have since decided not to go ahead with. Should that happen, they will be reverted in the build after next. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Proving Grounds
is proving grounds meant to last into the future, or just a MoP feature?
we'd like for it to endure. The current one has a Pandaren theme but we could rebuild it to use a different theme. Source 

Do DPS Stand in fire the entire time in a Healer Proving Ground? That would be epic.
They also body pull adds that the tank hasn't picked up yet. Source 

Will DPS proving grounds be tuned around having a 24 sec interrupt? If so, whats the expectation for Shadow Priests w/ 45s?
Most CCs also work to interrupt in Proving Grounds. You should be fine. Source 

Proving Grounds 90 is a missed opportunity; shouldn't this be encouraged at lower levels, i.e. 30, to 'learn your roles'
If the feature proves popular, we'll certainly expand on the idea. We'd have to change the content quite a lot for low lvls. Source 

UI / Addons
Does the restriction on changing raid groups in combat still serve a purpose nowadays? "Okay, 3 minute break before Ji-Kun..."
A little concern about a mod that puts the debuff target in slot 1 and lets the dispeller spam slot 1. Source 
If we could prevent that, then it would be fine to let you switch whenever. We know it's a hassle. Source 

PTR
Presumably you still pay your QA staff?You'd get more players on the PTR if you didn't treat it like free testing.
We don't really target PTR to players for bug finding. Our QA will find nearly all bugs. It's more about feedback. Source
