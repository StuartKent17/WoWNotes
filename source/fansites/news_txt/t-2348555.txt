Mail Templates

#423 New - $n, It is through your actions and heroism that the mail continues to flow successfully throughout Azeroth and beyond. However, I must come clean - I have not been completely honest with you. The events which first brought you here were orchestrated - I knew you were the only one that could save the post office from an undue end. I cannot rely on you forever - the mail must be able to operate without your aid. I must ask you to help me orchestrate once more to guide more into these stamped halls to give me aid. Take the attached message and send it to someone you deem worthy to carry the torch forward. I trust you to the end. - The Postmaster
