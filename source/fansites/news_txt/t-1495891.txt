Warlords of Draenor Beta Invites at PAX
It looks like everyone that went to PAX and tested Warlords of Draenor was able to score an invite  to Closed Beta.


  


Launcher Update - Warlords of Draenor Alpha
Previously the Battle.Net Launcher listed Warlords of Draenor as a Beta, but a recent update renamed it to Alpha. 


  


Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons
Warlords of Draenor is adding Garrisons, which are WoW's version of Player Housing. Rather than decorating a house, you are able to build and upgrade a base, as well as collecting followers. Blizzard has previously shown off some Garrison artwork , as well as sharing some information at Blizzcon during the World of Warcraft: What's Next panel  and the World of Warcraft Raids, Gameplay, Questing, and More panel

Garrison Levels
Right now there are two different locations with plots in the files, one of which doesn't include the fishing hut.

Level 1 - 2 Small Plots, 1 Medium Plot, 1 Large Plot, Mine, Farm, and Fishing Hut
Level 2 - 3 Small Plots, 2 Medium Plots, 2 Large Plots, Mine, Farm, and Fishing Hut
Level 3 - 4 Small Plots, 3 Medium Plots, 3 Large Plots, Mine, Farm, and Fishing Hut



Buildings
A garrison is made up of plots, which are filled by buildings.


You can't have every building at once, as you are limited by the number of plots. 
Each building has a base level and two possible upgrades.
There are buildings for almost every profession, which allow you to gather reagents daily and make some of that profession's items. 
The base level profession building only can hold one day's worth of reagents, so you have to collect them every day. As you upgrade, the building can hold two and then four days worth of reagent batches. 
Each building has specializations, which gives you some kind of perk, such as portals, more reagents, or buffs to followers.
Each building sits on a different plot size, with Profession buildings requiring small plots. The Mine, Fishing Hut, Farm, and Pet Menagerie are listed as unique plot types.

PvE
Any indication of what a mythic roster looks like, role-wise? An inkling would sure help me go from 10-man to mythic.
2-3 tanks mostly 2, 4-6 healers mostly 5, ~13 DPS. WatcherDev 

I'd say that an unwritten law is that if an encounter is designed for X healers, top guilds will X-1 heal at least
It may be nearly unavoidable at the very cutting edge. It's a problem when people are still underhealing months later. WatcherDev 
When you're undergeared the first weeks, better to wipe 90% of the time to lacking heals than 100% of the time to lacking DPS WatcherDev 

Do you consider the fact that most raids 'reset' Dark Shamans so they spawn outside the room a design mistake?
Not ideal; was a band-aid late in the PTR cycle for the fact that pulling them out to begin the pull was awkward. WatcherDev 

WHY do you enable cross realm on heroic mode when there are still realm first on the table??
Realm Firsts aren't removed by this. You still need a guild group to achieve a realm first. Celestalon 
But 3 people can get to our server and help kill garrosh and the guild get the realm first?
Yes, you could have 3 xrealm people help your 25man group kill Garrosh. That's still 22 players from the guild; they earn it. Celestalon 
In my opinion that's not fair at all I have been fighting to get to the top guild... to some random people come and take it away
But that's the point; it wouldn't be some random people coming to take it away. They can't do that. Celestalon 
Some people and we have proff are selling us the kill of garrosh with our accounts. Ofcourse we didn't accept it...
That's totally against our ToS, and we are staunchly against that. And, it's completely unrelated to this change. Celestalon 
For a ToS clarification, what sort of kill/achievement sales go against it? Obviously playing other accounts would.
I believe can answer that. I was just immediately responding to the "playing others' accounts" part, which is obvious Celestalon 

Any eta on when heroic/normal no longer shares a lockout. AKA can we do both a normal and a heroic run in the same week?
The pre-Warlords patch 6.0. That's a much more fundamental change to how raids are structured. WatcherDev 

Also, what would it do if the printed to file combat log saw EVERYTHING. Including things in other phases like Norushen.
Working on getting the combat log to do exactly that - couple of issues to sort out but nothing insurmountable. WatcherDev 

PvP
did you ever test 4v4 arena games? I feel 5v5 is too much of a zerg fest, curious about how 4v4 would feel...
2 healers 2 dps is not fun holinka 
I was thinking of it as a 2heals+2dps and 1heal+3dps mix, kinda like 2s with heal+dps and double dps...
We could always enforce role compositions but that feels very heavy handed. Better when a meta emerges. holinka 

Any plans on allowing Vicious Skeletal Warhorse and other Vicious Saddle mounts account-wide ?
Nope. They are character bound to encourage repeat accomplishment. holinka 

do you think removing 2v2 could improve pool and focus of arenas more?
tricky question. I think it would improve 3v3 participation but reduce arena participation overall. holinka 

Any chance to make cross-spec gearing for Hybrids easier? Currently you're stuck with one spec until the near end of season.
In warlords, the primary stat on gear changes based in your spec. Lots of info out there about it. holinka 


Heartbleed Account Security Notice
Many news sites are reporting a vulnerability dubbed the Heartbleed bug discovered in OpenSSL, an encryption technology used by a majority of websites and online services—including banks, email providers, and social media sites—to protect sensitive data as it’s transmitted from users to web services.

We want to emphasize that Battle.net’s encryption was not affected by this vulnerability. However, if you use the same password on Battle.net that you use elsewhere, your Battle.net account could be at risk if those sites were affected by this bug.
If the above situation applies to you, we recommend changing your Battle.net password to a new, unique password. As always, we recommend that you maintain separate login credentials for each online service you use. Using the same email or password across multiple services greatly increases the potential impact of any compromise.
