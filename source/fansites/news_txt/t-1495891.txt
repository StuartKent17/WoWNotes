Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons
Warlords of Draenor is adding Garrisons, which are WoW's version of Player Housing. Rather than decorating a house, you are able to build and upgrade a base, as well as collecting followers. Blizzard has previously shown off some Garrison artwork http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3753-Artcraft-Building-a-Garrison, as well as sharing some information at Blizzcon during the World of Warcraft: What's Next panel http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3523-World-of-Warcraft-What-s-Next and the World of Warcraft Raids, Gameplay, Questing, and More panel http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3540-World-of-Warcraft-Raids-Gameplay-Questing-and-More.

Garrison Levels
Right now there are two different locations with plots in the files, one of which doesn't include the fishing hut.

PvE
Any indication of what a mythic roster looks like, role-wise? An inkling would sure help me go from 10-man to mythic.
2-3 tanks mostly 2, 4-6 healers mostly 5, ~13 DPS. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/447399563318398976

I'd say that an unwritten law is that if an encounter is designed for X healers, top guilds will X-1 heal at least
It may be nearly unavoidable at the very cutting edge. It's a problem when people are still underhealing months later. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445578299587043328
When you're undergeared the first weeks, better to wipe 90% of the time to lacking heals than 100% of the time to lacking DPS WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445578450372268033

Do you consider the fact that most raids 'reset' Dark Shamans so they spawn outside the room a design mistake?
Not ideal; was a band-aid late in the PTR cycle for the fact that pulling them out to begin the pull was awkward. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/446013373436534784

WHY do you enable cross realm on heroic mode when there are still realm first on the table??
Realm Firsts aren't removed by this. You still need a guild group to achieve a realm first. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446017700943241216
But 3 people can get to our server and help kill garrosh and the guild get the realm first?
Yes, you could have 3 xrealm people help your 25man group kill Garrosh. That's still 22 players from the guild; they earn it. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446018494811742208
In my opinion that's not fair at all I have been fighting to get to the top guild... to some random people come and take it away
But that's the point; it wouldn't be some random people coming to take it away. They can't do that. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446019596890279936
Some people and we have proff are selling us the kill of garrosh with our accounts. Ofcourse we didn't accept it...
That's totally against our ToS, and we are staunchly against that. And, it's completely unrelated to this change. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446020821752893440
For a ToS clarification, what sort of kill/achievement sales go against it? Obviously playing other accounts would.
I believe can answer that. I was just immediately responding to the "playing others' accounts" part, which is obvious Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446041078970327041

Any eta on when heroic/normal no longer shares a lockout. AKA can we do both a normal and a heroic run in the same week?
The pre-Warlords patch 6.0. That's a much more fundamental change to how raids are structured. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/446073091655888896

Also, what would it do if the printed to file combat log saw EVERYTHING. Including things in other phases like Norushen.
Working on getting the combat log to do exactly that - couple of issues to sort out but nothing insurmountable. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/446870706786033664

PvP
did you ever test 4v4 arena games? I feel 5v5 is too much of a zerg fest, curious about how 4v4 would feel...
2 healers 2 dps is not fun holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/446100497255002112
I was thinking of it as a 2heals+2dps and 1heal+3dps mix, kinda like 2s with heal+dps and double dps...
We could always enforce role compositions but that feels very heavy handed. Better when a meta emerges. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/446125002090221568

Any plans on allowing Vicious Skeletal Warhorse and other Vicious Saddle mounts account-wide ?
Nope. They are character bound to encourage repeat accomplishment. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/446210597458169856

do you think removing 2v2 could improve pool and focus of arenas more?
tricky question. I think it would improve 3v3 participation but reduce arena participation overall. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/446477201349681152

Any chance to make cross-spec gearing for Hybrids easier? Currently you're stuck with one spec until the near end of season.
In warlords, the primary stat on gear changes based in your spec. Lots of info out there about it. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/446683865969463296


Heartbleed Account Security Notice
Many news sites are reporting a vulnerability dubbed the Heartbleed bug discovered in OpenSSL, an encryption technology used by a majority of websites and online services—including banks, email providers, and social media sites—to protect sensitive data as it’s transmitted from users to web services.

We want to emphasize that Battle.net’s encryption was not affected by this vulnerability. However, if you use the same password on Battle.net that you use elsewhere, your Battle.net account could be at risk if those sites were affected by this bug.
If the above situation applies to you, we recommend changing your Battle.net password to a new, unique password. As always, we recommend that you maintain separate login credentials for each online service you use. Using the same email or password across multiple services greatly increases the potential impact of any compromise.

More information about the Heartbleed vulnerability can be found at http://heartbleed.com, and you can find additional information on how to protect your Battle.net accounts at http://www.battle.net/security.
