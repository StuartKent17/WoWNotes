Now that the community managers stopped their posting frenzy it seems that I forgot a few things in the 2.4 info list, nothing really important but it's always nice to know a bit more about the upcoming patch.

The profession UI search field has been improved and now allows for searching of more types of things. For instance you can search for items by socket color, by effect "Critical Strike" for instance or search gems by their effect "Strength" for instance. In addition, the searching of items by level has been made more intuitive. You can now search for items by level with "15-20" to search for items that you can make that have a minimum level required of 15 to 20.

These updates have been added to the original post http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=4018.0 as well, and since a lot of non-regular users have been coming to the sites for the 2.4 notes it might be a good idea to relink the Sunwell Loots leak http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/sunwell_loots.jpg, as usual nothing is confirmed by Blizzard and you should trust me at your own risks, for detailed explanations about this check the original post http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=3792.0

PTR Down ... Character copy up ?
I don't know if they decided to make the character copy available early for the 2.4 patch or if it's just an old version of the character copy page brought back online, but you are now free to copy your characters on test servers. Keep in mind that it could be a test or something like that, we can't be sure that your character will be available on 2.4 test realms if you copy them now.

Blizzard wins against Peons4hire in Court
Blizzard’s lawsuit against virtual item and power-leveling company In Game Dollar doing business as Peons4Hire has settled, resulting in a permanent injunction .pdf that essentially shuts down In Game Dollar’s entire World of Warcraft operation. Though no monetary damages are specified, the injunction represents a complete victory for Blizzard. The news is likely to be well received by the World of Warcraft player community, which voiced widespread support for Blizzard’s move when the lawsuit was filed.

The Complaint .pdf alleged that In Game Dollar violated World of Warcraft’s Terms of Use and End User License Agreement by spamming chat in World of Warcraft with advertising. Peons4Hire was not the largest virtual property dealer in World of Warcraft, but it was well known for aggressive in-game marketing via chat spam. The lawsuit could be seen as a shot across the bow of larger sellers.

The key provision of the injunction specifically prohibits In Game Dollar from “engaging in the sale of World of Warcraft® virtual assets or power leveling services.” In Game Dollar is also permanently enjoined from:

"Making any use of the World of Warcraft® in-game communication or chat system to advertise any website, business, or commercial endeavor, including any business associated with In Game Dollar, LLC or www.peons4hire.com.

Sending messages to the World of Warcraft® servers, the World of Warcraft® in-game communication or chat system or any other computer used by Blizzard in connection with the World of Warcraft® game, if such messages mention or advertise the website www.peons4hire.com, In Game Dollar LLC or any other commercial endeavor.

Making any unauthorized use, or obtaining any unauthorized access to Blizzard’s computer systems or network."

The injunction also prohibits In Game Dollar from investing in a new operation doing any of the enjoined acts, and authorizes the court to award damages in the event that the company violates any of the terms. Essentially, the injunction puts In game Dollar out of the World of Warcraft virtual item and power-leveling business. The Peons4Hire website is down.

However, this doesn't mean the end of chat spamming because as mentionned in the virtuallyblind.com http://virtuallyblind.com/2008/02/01/peons4hire-blizzard-injunction/ article "The injunction is part of a settlement, so it does not carry the precedential weight that a decision on the merits would carry."
