Azsharan Medallion Quest<br>
The Xal&apos;atath quest line won&apos;t appear for a while. <br>
So now that 8.1.5 is live I went straight to the first Naga invasion and killed like a million of em and no medallion (https://www.wowdb.com/items/165668-azsharan-medallion), is the quest live? Anyone know the drop rate? Even Wowhead doesn&#x2019;t have much to say on this. Anyone?!!! I really want the Xal Atath chain to unlock my gift of N&#x2019;Zoth<br>
Confirmed &#x2013; the beginnings of this questline will start appearing closer to the opening of the Crucible of Storms raid in April.</div></div>
