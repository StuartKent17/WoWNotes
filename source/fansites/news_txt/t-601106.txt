Welcome on MMO-Champion !

Site is finally open and we will add more contents very soon, essentially raid strategies which are still missing but hey ... these things take a tremendous amount of time and also a few more things, but you should already find a bunch of useful informations. 

If you notice an error or a bug on the website post on the forums. You can also post if you would like to see something added to the website.

Thanks to :

- A few items tooltips still don't work, but clicking them should still give you proper informations about them.
