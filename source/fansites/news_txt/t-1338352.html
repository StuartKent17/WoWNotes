Patch 5.4 - Visions of Time: Courting Destiny<br>
Patch 5.4 adds a quest line on the Timeless Isle that involves working for Kairoz (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/72870-kairoz) of the Keepers of Time (http://wowpedia.org/Keepers_of_Time). He is on the Timeless Isle because the Bronze Dragonflight is not as powerful as it once was, only being able to catch furtive glimpses through time. He has created an hourglass that will allow for a window into the timeways, but you must collect 50 x Epoch Stones (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/105715-epoch-stone) to make it usable. <br>
<br>
After collecting the stones, you embark on a series of weekly quests to use the Vision of Time (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/105930-vision-of-time) in different locations to calibrate the Vision of Time. Kairoz eventually will reveal (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/33376-seeking-fate) that there is a traitor among the Bronze Dragonflight.<br>
<br>
As the hourglass grows more powerful, he will send you (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/33378-courting-destiny) to the Temple of the White Tiger to see a glimpse of Garrosh and Anduin, which is the scene you see below. <br>

Connected Realms and Battlegroups<br>
so who is getting grouped with who then, and will it go by current battlegroups? <br>
The battlegroups is a factor for sure that needs to be taken into account, but I cannot say yet if they will be a limiting factor. Also, we are still in the process of determining which realms to connect, so we it will be a little while still before we can announce a list of the realms that will be connected.

Darker Nights<br>
&quot;Patch 5.4 will have a test case for darker nights in Orgrimmar, Stormwind, and Vale of Eternal Blossoms.&quot;<br>
Blue-tagged! Sleep tight and enjoy the night, don&apos;t let the Sha of Nightmares bite! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/267618-suggestion-bring-back-the-night-part-three/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7860907601?page=8#155))<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
Flex Raiding<br>
Sure, makes total sense, but btw three raid lockouts per week may be overkill. H Raiders seem not excited about Flex.<br>
Not sure why heroic raiders would run flex more than once or twice unless their progression in heroic was really slow. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/371353516469530624))<br>
You&apos;re not sure why..? because of ridiculous trinkets, set bonuses, and weapons if they&apos;ve been RNG-screwed in ToT.<br>
Set bonuses are a problem if you&apos;ve just been very unlucky. Trinkets are a problem if we screw up the balance. Wpns should not be. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372094786309586944))<br>
If you rerolled or something, maybe, but if you have a N or H weapon from the previous tier, you should be good to go. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372094889883734016))<br>
<br>
Raid Finder<br>
Getting bored of people moaning about LFR. Take it away and I may as well cancel my sub.<br>
We like LFR. It&apos;s not going anywhere. Just trying to provide additional features on top of it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373888227750334464))<br>
<br>
you never put in the tools like a good voice communication system for LFR to succeed as organized gameplay. ur fault<br>
I don&apos;t think difficult + voice forces random groups to coordinate, but it&apos;s a fair criticism that our voice sucks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373886798969044992))<br>
<br>
i will not use flex on principle its an attempt to kill lfr.<br>
It is not an attempt to kill LFR. It&apos;s an attempt to provide a more casual alternative to N for social groups who don&apos;t enjoy LFR. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373885346028605440))<br>
<br>
the thing is...LFR Takes away the epic experience. dont believe me? look at every raid since 4.3.<br>
Another POV is LFR provides an epic experience for players who otherwise never would have had it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372559242659500033))<br>
100% agree that LFR is less epic than normal (or flex). But it is more epic than a YouTube of the fight. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372559557500760064))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Is the normal mode still all open on the first week?Tom Chilton says the normal will just open wing 1 on the first week.<br>
The plan is normal will all open on the first week. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373511798147653632))<br>
<br>
Out of curiosity, will in the Siege raid. Will the Horde have a time where a npc clear out a portion of the mobs?<br>
We are trying to give both H and A cool moments in the raid without just mirroring each other. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/371354927429189633))<br>
<br>
Does this mean it will take four lockouts for the cloak quest? Or will you be able to kill he last three in week 1?<br>
The latter. You just only get loot for the first &quot;kill&quot; that week. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373888079641063424))<br>
wiait, so position has changed that legendary cloak could be unlocked in first week? Now it will take at least 4 weeks?<br>
You can &quot;kill&quot; all the celestials on day one. You only get loot from the first one you defeat every week. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373886137518923776))<br>
<br>
so the next xpac will be another cataclysm, you had this talk before that launch about difficulty and need to change<br>
No, the problem with Cat was there was no alternatives to HC dungeons. As I said, exclusive is fine as long as alternative exist. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373886468952817666))<br>

Another developer interview:<br>
<br>
The Horde version of the cinematic after Garrosh will show the process of the Warchief selection. The Alliance version will be slightly different.<br>
The technology for scaling up old content is mostly in place now, but the devs haven&apos;t come up with a good rewards scheme for scaled up old dungeons and raids yet.<br>
<br>
DiabloFans posted a nice recap for the Reaper of Souls (http://www.diablofans.com/news/1984-the-massive-expansion-recap-everything-we-know-so-far/) expansion.<br>

<br>
Blizzard isn&apos;t ready to show off any of the new player models yet, but hopefully will have an announcement soon.<br>
