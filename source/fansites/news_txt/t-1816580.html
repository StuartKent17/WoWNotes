Arena Skirmishes Bonus Event July 10 &#x2013; 13<br>
Service Update July 10, 12:05 p.m. PDT - We are aware of an issue preventing the quest The Arena Calls from properly displaying your number of wins. Arena Skirmish wins are being correctly counted, and you will be able to complete the quest after your tenth win.<br>
<br>
Through the end of the day on Monday, Arena Skirmishes award triple bonus honor. There&#x2019;s never been a better time to queue up for the Arena and crack some skulls. Keep an eye out for the event-only quest The Arena Calls. When you win 10 Arena matches, the quest awards 500 Conquest Points which do not count against your weekly Conquest Point maximum.<br>
<br>
In case you&#x2019;ve never participated in an Arena Skirmish, here&#x2019;s an easy how-to guide:<br>
<br>
From anywhere in-game, open the Group Finder (default hotkey: i)<br>
Select the Player vs. Player tab on the bottom of the window.<br>
Under Arena Battles, choose either 2v2 or 3v3.<br>
Click the Join Battle button to be matched up with teammates.<br>
<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s Arena PvP! Rush in and bash your opponents.<br>
<br>
Will you answer the call to battle?<br>

Thanks for making Ashran impossible for people who play at night.<br>
Definitely concerned about the off peak experience. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/617741860476452864))<br>

Lore<br>
And if Warlocks can control/manipulate souls, which are undead, to haunt people, then they are technically practicing necromancy..<br>
I suppose that depends on your definition of necromancy, and it&apos;s ok to have your own. Control of souls vs. raising soulless UD. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/617753692859666432))<br>
Not really...necromancy extends to controlling souls/ghosts/banshees and Gul&apos;dan used a variation of the Soulstone ability to<br>
I don&apos;t think I&apos;m going to convince you, nor should I Cool to see someone so passionate about their toon! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/617755222472048640))<br>
<br>
abilities are non-canon?<br>
Of course you use souls, you have soul shards. You dont use them to raise the dead though. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/617748069967249408))<br>

Totally agree. Will work on fixing. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/617559646082088960))<br>
