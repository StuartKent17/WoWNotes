The Demon Hunter was considered for the Burning Crusade, but the team wasn't ready to add another class to the game at that point.
Distinguishing the Demon Hunter from Monks and Rogues will be important. Rogues are about stealth and crowd control, whereas the Demon Hunter is about in your face mobility and getting out when they are in trouble. Monks are a little more of a hybrid, with some self healing. 
The Eye Beam for Demon Hunter is a skillshot, as it is a narrow cone attack. 
Dalaran has some modifications for the storyline, changes to the center area, changes to the Underbelly, as well as updated textures.
The current plan is for Dalaran is to have a free for all PvP area in the Underbelly. You can bribe the guards to make them go away for a while.
It would be hard to eliminate existing talent trees, as some players would be upset of the removal of a spec they really liked. If the team could go back in time, there might have been a few that never got added, but now that those trees exist they will try to make them more distinct. 
Subtlety Rogues will keep doing down the ninja route, Combat will be a little more like a Pirate Swashbuckler, and Assassination will be about poisons and Damage over Time.
The Honor system is changing from a currency style system to an experience style system. You get benefits from the honor levels such as opportunities to get loot or gold.
The Prestige system will give hardcore players a reason to keep playing, even if their power doesn't increase. 
Gear will have less of an impact in PvP. There is no such thing as PvP gear anymore, so no Resilience,PvP specific stats, or sets. Beyond a commonly available item level, you will get drastically diminishing returns from increasing your item level. Somewhere between 5 to 1 and 10 to 1 diminishing returns. The best raider in the game might have a 7% advantage over a player that just hit the level cap.
The team is considering allowing players to transmog their Mists of Pandaria legendary cloak and Warlords legendary ring, as they were available for a limited time. They want to avoid a situation like everyone farming Warglaives for transmog.
It is possible that in a future expansion more races could become Demon Hunters, but for now it is only Blood Elves and Night Elves. 
You can use the double jump in battlegrounds and dungeons. The team will be careful to avoid breaking the game with Demon Hunters using double jump current content, such as groups that only want Demon Hunters to skip things in dungeons.
Tanaan is a big and awesome zone with a lot of cool spawns. It has generated a lot of engagement with the player base. There are a lot of players doing it every day. The team wants to continue to evolve the endgame world content model though, as they aren't happy with the combination of daily quests and bonus objectives. They are two pieces of the puzzle, but larger ongoing story development is also important, similar to what was in Patch 5.1. Other mechanics to add more replayability and variation would also be good additions and there are plans for Legion to make better endgame world content. 
Gul'dan is the instigator in Legion, but not the big bad guy. He is a raid boss in the raids at launch, but not the final boss of the expansion.


Millenium http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x30y5is

Legion may be shorter than other expansion names, but it describes the expansion perfectly, especially if you understand the context of the word in Warcraft history.
Azeroth is the only world that we know of that the Legion hasn't conquered yet. 
We will discover the motivations of the Burning Legion. They aren't just going throughout the universe causing chaos.
The Broken Isles has been pretty quiet as of late, until the Tomb of Sargeras was activated. People knew it was there before, but there was no real motivation to go there. 
Tension between the Horde and Alliance is an important part of the game and this expansion. 


Tweakers.net http://tweakers.net/reviews/4144/2/world-of-warcraft-legion-in-gesprek-met-de-makers-artifacts.html

The team hasn't decided if Blacksmiths or Jewelcrafters will be able to make items that modify your Artifact.

All Druid forms connected with the Artifact weapon will be updated. Keep in mind this is a translated summary, Moonkin was not specifically mentioned



Legion Trademark
It appears that we didn't see the trademark early this time because it wasn't filed until the day of the announcement. Blizzard also trademarked "World of Warcraft Legion" rather than just the expansion name on its own this time.

Rogue Order Hall
Some Rogues were more enthusiastic about Ravenholdt as an Order Hall rather than Dalaran Sewers. 
As a rogue, #RavenholdtOrRiot
no riot pls. the feedback has definitely been heard, and is something we'll discuss back at the office WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/630587454341414912
dalaran sewers has no essence for me as a rogue, im sure others feel the same.
If I call it "a hidden rogues' guild in the Dalaran underground" is that any cooler? Sewer was not the greatest shorthand. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/630602817166815232
Let me guess: you guys already did put some work into it, right? Don't want to start over?
Or, less cynically, I just want to make sure that feedback isn't being biased by "eww, sewer." WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/630732442689740800
"Seedy underground thieves' lair, right under the public's noses" vs "mansion out in the mountains in the middle of nowhere"? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/630603373595615233
Light's Hope Chapel is just as "middle of nowhere" as Ravenholdt.
It's a strong Rogue theme to be 'hiding right behind you'. Not so much for Paladins. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/630604577499262977
The fact is, players *aren't* lowly thieves. They are the best of the best. And those folks like mansions!
Who said you were lowly? There are obviously preconceptions here, and any place can be portrayed poorly or greatly with copious use of adjectives with good/bad connotations. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/630633035612844032

This is the kind of thing you should put out innocent-looking blog polls for well in advance. A "what location feels most iconic to your class?" blog would tell you exactly where to put them.
That would limit choices to existing locations. What if there's a cooler *new* place? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/630603871405015040

Blue Posts
PvP Gear
What Tom said was that someone wearing the absolute best PvE gear in the game might have a 7% advantage over someone who had just hit level 100 -- and thus, had not collected any gear at all. There was nothing about his statement at all that could be taken as "the best gear for PvP comes from PvE." I have no idea how you could have gotten that from what he said, unless you're purposefully trying to stir up trouble.

Our intent -- as it has been for several expansions now, and as it is currently in Warlords -- is for PvP gear to be the best available in PvP. That has not changed in Legion.

I'm curious how you guys will accomplish that with the complete removal of "pvp gear." Hopefully more info soon to clarify this gray area.
Yep, definitely something that needs clarifying. At the moment, we're just waiting for developers to get back from gamescom so we can be sure we have all of our facts straight.

World PvP and PvP Talents
The intent is that PvP talents activate in world PvP, similar to how PvP item levels currently activate in Warlords. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/383162-active-world-pvp-realists-pvp-talents/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18300628406?page=23#452

Flying in Legion
Judging by this quote, it would seem we are basically not going to be getting flying until long after the final patch in Legion.

Intentional or not, the wording from Blizzard on this issue is deceptive. They would be better off just out and saying "We feel the expansion is experienced better with no flying, but we will add it a while after the final patch".
The quote is in reference to how you are able to earn flying for Draenor via an Achievement. If you read some of the interviews out there and we'll try to make sure we gather them up for people, it's mentioned that you should be able to start working on the Achievement as of the start of the expansion. Again, it's very early and we only just announced the expansion, so we'll have a lot more information to share on this and many other things announced during gamescom. 

Flying for Draenor is coming and anyone who is able to help test it on the PTR is very appreciated. We want to make sure we have people in the air versus falling through the world.

Thanks for posting. Whether I agree with your sentiments or not, I understand you're trying to put a positive spin on a situation you did not create.
I'm just trying to add some balance where I can. I understand passion and understand people expressing that passion on a variety of topics regarding the game. But, expressing that passion can be done without resorting to hyperbole and code of conduct violations on the forums.

You are so about to be rushed by angry fly-babies. It was nice knowing you though.
People have been twisting my words or using them as "promises" for many years now. I'm not going anywhere. I also don't like the trend of calling people or groups of people names just because they have something they feel strongly about. It's not worthy of anyone who wants to have their thoughts taken seriously.

Pre-Order for Legion
When World of Warcraft Legion will be available for pre order ? Im so excited I want to pre order it right now lol.
We'll let you know when pre-orders become available. Don't worry. 

I know people have a lot of questions about what will be included in the pre-order, but I don't have those answers to share just yet. We'll make sure we cover as much as possible when we announce them though.

Legion
Artifact's stats will still improve as you defeat BOSSES, Relics: completing major quest lines, DUNGEONS, & RAIDS...
The more difficult the content you do, the higher your weapon's DPS will be. That's been true since 2004, no? WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/630609754210103296

Character / Items
Did you just nerf Felblight x5 drop rates a couple hours ago? Was getting them ALL the time the past 5 days, now i get none.
This was hotfixed yesterday. It wasn't intended for 5x Felblight to drop so frequently from profession resources in Tanaan. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/628683488883929088

Events
There are three tents still marked as Under Construction at the Darkmoon Faire. What mini-games would you put there? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/628057043488772096
Had some real ideas for an Darkmoon faire but its been a while. Ill get back to you with them when I remember
Already have plans for two of them so you'd better hurry >=] Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/628058374077157377
Hammer and bell is kinda boring though... if there were no constraints, what would you wanna implement? 
No constraints at all? Darkmoon DDR. Like Flash Flash Revolution but with techno carnival music. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/628094099707396096
