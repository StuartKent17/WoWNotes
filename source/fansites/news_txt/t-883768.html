As promised in earlier blue posts, Patch 4.1 adds a couple of Archaeology rewards to the game. The Fossile and Troll branches are getting some love and you should be able to find these new rare items after the patches. <br>

Patch 4.1 Public Test Realm Notes - April 8 #2<br>
The Patch 4.1 PTR notes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/160430/patch-41-public-test-realm-notes-april-8) have been updated slightly after Blizzard published the update on their blog yesterday. The change to allow player to use flying mounts in Ghostlands was removed and Sinestra is being slightly tweaked. <br>
General<br>
<br>
Flying mounts can now be used in Ghostlands.<br>
Several persistent ground effects now display different visuals for hostile and friendly players. The following spells have the same visual effects for friendly players, but new alternate visuals for hostile players: Ring of Frost, Consecration, Desecration, Wild Mushroom, Flare, Ice Trap, Power Word: Barrier, Smoke Bomb, and Hand of Gul&apos;dan. As a general rule, the alternate effects have a red tint or hue indicating they are created by an enemy player. There are currently some issues with this new change which are affecting several of these abilities and is not working as intended at this time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br>
Sinestra<br>
<br>
Twilight Slicer is now less likely to target two helers at once.<br>
Wrack will avoid jumping to tanks.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guilds<br>
Guild Challenges<br>
<br>
Gold rewards require the qualified guild members of the group to be honored with their guild, and the guild must be are now deposited into the guild bank once the guild reaches level 5. The text for the Cash Flow guild perk has been updated appropriately. <br>

Blue posts outside of announcements almost feel like christmas lately, I wonder if anyone is going to bring cookies. <br>
Making WoW Easier<br>
I understand and respect gaming masochism. But, I think that changing mechanics to be more reasonable and less punishing is an improvement, not a detriment, to games in general. Many of us Original Gamers pine for the days of D&amp;D-based yore when games were seemingly intended to break us down into sobbing masses created by an uncaring necromancer of pain and suffering, or at least didn&apos;t try to avoid it. Overcoming all of the obstacles (I CHOOSE NOT TO SHOOT HER WITH THE SILVER ARROW... NOOOOO) was a big part of what gaming (I HAVE 1 LIFE!?), and especially PC gaming (HOW DO I LOAD MOUSE DRIVERS?), were about. But, I feel we&apos;re lucky to now be in an age where those ideals (intended or not) are giving way to actual fun, actual challenge, and not fabricating it through high-reach requirements (I NEED A FAIRY MONK WITH A MAGIC LOCKPICK?).<br>
<br>
What we&apos;ve always been trying to do, what WoW has always been about (and to which much of its success is due) is to make an accessible MMO. Anyone that looks back at the game at launch and wishes it was as challenging now as it was then is not aware of the painstaking effort put into making this game accessible as compared to its predecessors. Since release we&apos;ve refined that intent, eventually evolving the very few masochistic designs WoW actually ever started with, but ideally still offering those same prestige goals that give that feeling of achieving something great if you&apos;re able to pull it off. We&apos;ve made a lot of progress toward striking that balance and continuing to evolve the game, but it&apos;s not something we&apos;re ever likely to perfect, and we&apos;ll be constantly working to hit that elusive goal. Hopefully it&apos;s to the benefit of everyone playing and enjoying the game, and they&apos;ll continue to enjoy the journey that a living, breathing, persistent universe will take us on.
