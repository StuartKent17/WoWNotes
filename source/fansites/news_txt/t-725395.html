The site was down during the night again, this isn&apos;t an effect of the vBulletin migration, it&apos;s just a lot of problems with the servers. I don&apos;t have access to that and ... well, phone calls in the middle of the night don&apos;t always work.<br>
<br>
Hopefully this won&apos;t happen again, I sincerely apologize for the downtime. I&apos;m as disappointed as you are but sadly this kind of stuff doesn&apos;t depend on me. <br>
<br>
News for the day will be up in a few minutes.</div></div>
