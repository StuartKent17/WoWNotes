World of Warcraft Now Includes Warlords
Warlords of Draenor was added to World of Warcraft on Tuesday. We took a similar approach with the previous expansion prior to the launch of Warlords of Draenor, and the response was very positive. This makes it easier than ever for new players interested in the upcoming Legion expansion to get into the game, and gives returning players a chance to catch up on content prior to the new expansion’s launch.

Level 90 character boosts are no longer available though players who purchased Warlords of Draenor prior to this change this will still be able to claim the included boost. Players who want to boost a character can either pre-purchase Legion, which includes a level 100 boost, or purchase a standalone level 100 boost.

Forgive me if this sounds dense, but I purchased the chest, including all games up to Pandaria. Does this mean that I can now continue into Draenor, or does it mean that anyone that NOW buys the chest gets WoD as well?
You should be able to continue into Draenor and to 100. You just won't have a 90 boost to use.


Recent Actions Against Botting in WoW
We’ve recently taken action against thousands of World of Warcraft accounts that were found to be using third-party programs that automate gameplay, known as “bots.” We’re committed to providing an equal and fair playing field for everyone in World of Warcraft, and will continue to take action against those found in violation of our Terms of Use. Cheating of any form will not be tolerated.

If you believe that you’ve encountered a player abusing a bot, exploit, or cheat, please let us know! You can do so by using the right-click report functionality in the game, and/or by emailing information to hacks@blizzard.com. 


Free BattleTag Change
As we prepare for the launch of Overwatch next week, we have refreshed the free BattleTag update for all Battle.net accounts! We often see feedback with requests to update your BattleTag, and as we move into a new universe filled with soldiers, scientists, adventurers and oddities it’s important that you have a nickname that represents you!

Like your current moniker? No problem! You will continue to keep and use your existing BattleTag without needing to take any action. Want to change it up? Visit your Account Management Dashboard http://battle.net/account/, and click the Change link under your Account Details to the right of your existing BattleTag! Players on your Battle.net Friends List, Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone, and Overwatch will see the update soon after the change.

In addition to the above update, requests for an option to update BattleTags more frequently is something we hear often from players. We’re exploring the possibilities, and will be sure to let you know of any updates! Keep an eye on our game sites and forums for announcements.

It won’t be long before the agents of Overwatch are recalled to active duty, and we hope that this update helps you get ready!

Flaskataur - Legendary Items
Did they remove Flaskataur from beta? Been spamming a target macro in SW and Dalaran and have yet to find him.
Yes, the Flaskataurs are taking a break to avoid skewing tuning and rewards feedback across the game as a whole. They'll be returning later on in the beta.

Restoration Druid -- Legion Beta Feedback
Resto's feral affinity needs help in the form of letting us hit more buttons more often. A straight up energy regen buff would do wonders for this.
We added this recently--you'll see it in either this build or next build. It may not be in the tooltip, so mentioning it now in case people want to try it out. The Feral Affinity version of Swipe was also buffed.

A cap on mastery stacking is a possibility for eventual tuning, but is not added in this build. The discussion about it is still germane.

Followup on this--beta has a bug where the bonus Agility that Resto and Balance Druids get in Cat Form Killer Instinct isn't applying. So if you try to use Feral Affinity right now your damage might be very low; we'll hotfix this to beta.

Is Void Storage being removed at the same time as Wardrobe arrives, do we need to empty it into our bags before the pre patch?
Void Storage is not being removed. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/730558691619938304

Do I need to stockpile brawler's guild shirts, or will there be a window when the brawler's guild and transmog system overlap?
You don’t have to keep them. If you dispose of them today, they’ll be in Wardrobe, since they're quest rewards. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/730933652083740672

Actually, I hope all Demon Hunter Arena comp names are bad Illidan puns. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/730864555379687425

Pets and Pet Battles
Did we ever determine if Pet Battle World Quests are account-wide or not? Can I complete set of 3 on toon A and then do it again on toon B?
Currently, they are not. Subject to change based on feedback. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/731216614297718784
