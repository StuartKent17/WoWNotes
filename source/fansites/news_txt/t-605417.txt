We're still waiting for most of the item stats but it's a good time for a recap. This time I also included screenshots of the arena weapons, keep in mind that they're not confirmed yet and only based on information we can find in the game files, however they should be fairly accurate. By popular demand, I also added a female version of armor screenshots.

Armor models
The following screenshots are all the armor models added in the game in the 2.4 Patch, they're armor sets from the Sunwell and Season 4 gear. Both gear use the same models, only the color is different

Season 4 ETA
It looks like we won't get the Season 4 as soon as the patch is released, we might have to wait a few weeks/months before it starts.
Not very soon. S3 rewards have quite a bit of life left in them before they start to feel obsoleted by pve gear.


Sunwell Plateau temporarily closed on PTRs
Sunwell Plateau is once again closed for a short amount of time because of a bug on Lady Sacrolash and Grand Warlock Alythess.
We discovered a pretty obnoxious bug with the Lady Sacrolash and Grand Warlock Alythess encounter that is making the encounter much more difficult than intended. Until we get that bug resolved, we're going to bring down the Sunwell Raid instance on the PTR. I have no ETA on the fix at this time.


Tournament Test Realm testing
Tuesday and Wednesday means maintenance on US and EU realms, why don't you use this time to help the testing on Tournament Test Realm ?

What's the Tournament Test Realm ?
This realm is used to test "Tournament" type realms, any character created on these realms will be level 70 and NPCs are selling PvP Armors/Weapons as well as enchantments and gems in all the starting zones. For more information about the tournament please check the following pages.
2008 World of Warcraft Arena tournament  page on the official site.
2008 World of Warcraft Arena tournament FAQ  on the official site.
List of items  available from NPCs on the Tournament realms.
If you plan to play on test realms, you should also read the TTR/PTR FAQ  on the official forums.

The Blizzard Downloader is fairly fast, but if you're still looking for a direct download link to download the first PTR patch, here you go. This is only the first "big" PTR patch, you will still have to download multiple "small" patches to get the latest build from PTRs

Focused testing
You might be able to help devs resolving these issues, if you see something strange run to your closest test realm forum and report the bug !
In Preparation of the arena realms we have made a number of fixes to various aspects of the area system. There are several issues that are very difficult to reproduce in controlled situations we believe these issues are fixed in 2.4 but we would like feedback from players to be sure.

Please if you see any of the following issues occurring while playing on the TTR report it in this thread.
Please post screenshots if able, this is a great help to us in tracking these issues down.

The Arena Teams can sometimes enter a state so that leaving a team can result in leaving a different team than intended.
Arena team win-loss statistics and individual team member win-loss statistics do not always match each other or the teams' gains/losses in rating.
It appears that sometimes a rated arena team can get matched up against a skirmish "team" in rated arena matches.
At the conclusion of an arena match sometimes there will be no arena team names displayed, the rating change column will display either "---" or a large random number, and the team that won will often report losing rating points several minutes after they have exited the match.
