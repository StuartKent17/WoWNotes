Extended downtime for May 6th & Patch 2.4.2
Let's start with the beginning, Patch 2.4.2 probably won't be deployed today. However US realms do have an extended maintenance from 03:00 AM to 11:00 AM PDT.
May 5th, 2008 8:10pm PDT
We will be performing extended maintenance for all realms on Tuesday, May 6th. The downtime will begin at 3:00am PDT and end at approximately 11:00am PDT.
About Patch 2.4.2, Hortus posted a message to inform people that the testing of the patch was complete ...
We will be taking the 2.4.2 PTR down shortly and ending the 2.4.2 PTR phase. 
... followed by a post to explain that 2.4.2 testing on PTR would be extended, this was probably caused by a serious bug found at the last minute and there is pretty much no chance to see the patch deployed on live servers this week.
We have decided to put the 2.4.2 PTR up for some additional testing. The realms should once again be available for play. 
It also means that the patch is almost complete, and it wouldn't be surprising to see it on live servers next week. Anyway, we do have a long maintenance in front of us and you might want to read the 2.4.2 related posts to be ready for the patch once it's ready.
