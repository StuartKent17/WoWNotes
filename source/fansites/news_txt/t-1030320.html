Update: Now we have official confirmation (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/207233/43-patch-release-and-maintenance-11-29) that Patch 4.3 will be released on 11/29, as well as a Season 10 ending reminder (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/207241/pvp-season-10-ending-soon). <br>
<br>
Diablo 3 - Even with the patch coming I&apos;m still working on shiny new Diablo stuff! Today on Diablofans we have a nice Diablo 3 Mystic and Item Enhancements Preview (http://www.diablofans.com/)!<br>
<br>
Patch 4.3 on live realms this week<br>
Patch 4.3 will be deployed on live realms this week, as usual there is a 1% chance that it will not happen if something goes really wrong but you should expect to be able to enter the Dragon Soul raid and kick deathwing&apos;s ... butt? on November 29th in the US and November 30th in EU. Time for the giant recap of what to expect from this patch!<br>
<br>
Raid Finder<br>
The new Raid Finder tool (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/623-Patch-4.3-Raid-Finder/) is a new way to build raids similar to the Looking for Dungeon tool. You can now queue for a 25-man raid and pretty much instantly jump in the fight to get your shiny epics! It also comes with a new &quot;Looking for Raid&quot; difficulty that makes bosses easier and puggable. <br>

Tier 13 Armor Sets<br>
New raid instance means new Tier armor sets and the Tier 13 might be one of the best design we&apos;ve seen in a while! <br>

Valor Points Rewards and Raid Loot<br>
A lot of gear has been added in this patch, you can get a lot of gear for your character from the Patch 4.3 Valor Points Rewards (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/179-Patch-4.3-Valor-Points-Rewards/) and for those of you who don&apos;t want to check individual bosses loot lists, we have a nice Dragon Soul Raid Loot List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2556-Dragon-Soul-Raid-Loot-Compilation-Fan-Art).<br>
<br>
<br>
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/november/valorpoint_th.jpg (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/179-Patch-4.3-Valor-Points-Rewards/) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/november/raidlootlist_th.jpg (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2556-Dragon-Soul-Raid-Loot-Compilation-Fan-Art)<br>
<br>
Also, Valor Points are now earned at the same rate in 10 and 25-man instances now. <br>
We&apos;ve made slight adjustments to the Valor Point (VP) drops on the 4.3 PTR which testers can now see. In both 10- and 25-player raids, bosses will now drop 100 VP each (down from 115 and 135 respectively). We&#x2019;ll also be changing Firelands raid bosses to drop 50 VP per kill upon release of the patch.<br>
<br>
This change is being made to further emphasize the desire to kill bosses for the items they drop. In the 4.3 raid, tier sets can only be earned from boss drops, and as Raid Finder will allow for just about anyone to get a chance to kill bosses, we think there will be less need for Valor overall. We want to try to match the lower desire for VP with a slightly slower acquisition rate.<br>
<br>
We appreciate your thoughts and constructive discussion on how these changes may affect you and your guild once 4.3 is released.<br>
<br>
<br>
5-Man Instances - Well of Eternity, Hour of Twilight, and End Time<br>
Three new 5-man instances are added to the game!

This patch adds almost 20 mounts to the game, and we already have the drop locations for more than 10 of them! Check out the Patch 4.3 Mounts (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/655-Patch-4.3-Mounts)!<br>

<br>
Patch 4.3 Companion Pets<br>
15 new companion pets have been added to the game in Patch 4.3, a lot of them are from the new Darkmoon Faire but there&apos;s also a couple of collector mounts, and even a Sea Pony! Check out the Patch 4.3 Companion Pets (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/654-Patch-4.3-Companion-Pets/). <br>

Darkmoon Faire Reworked - Darkmoon Faire Island!<br>
The Darkmoon Faire has been completely reworked and got its own zone, it&apos;s now MUCH bigger and is located on the Darkmoon Faire Island! Feel free to read Patch 4.3 Darkmoon Faire (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2543-Patch-4.3-The-New-Darkmoon-Faire-is-on-Test-Realms!/). <br>

Season 11 Armor Sets and PvP Rewards<br>
For all the PvPers out there we have a nice list of Season 11 Armor Sets and PvP Gear (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/659-Season-11-Armor-Sets-Patch-4.3/)!<br>
<br>
<br>
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/november/s11_th.jpg (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/659-Season-11-Armor-Sets-Patch-4.3/)<br>
<br>
Don&apos;t forget that you can also earn Conquest points from regular battlegrounds victories now, and the amount of Conquest points earned in Rated BG has been considerably increased.<br>
In patch 4.3 we&#x2019;re changing the daily battleground (BG) to reward 100 conquest for a win (up from 25). In addition, every non-rated BG that you win will also give you 50 conquest. There is no limit to how many BGs you can run this way, up to the normal conquest cap.<br>
<br>
Our intent is to start acting even more on our Mists of Pandaria philosophies of encouraging players to approach the content they want to, how they want to, and be able to work toward meaningful player progression. Arenas and rated battlegrounds will still earn Conquest faster, but with this change you can now work your way up by running normal BGs, if you so choose.<br>
<br>
<br>
Patch Notes<br>
This is not the final version of the patch notes, only the latest update of the test realm notes. There might be a few changes in the final version but most of the changes are here. <br>
&lt;script&gt;$(function () { ttlib.init(); })&lt;/script&gt; &lt;b&gt;World of Warcraft PTR Patch 4.3.0&lt;/b&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;General&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;New Dungeon &amp;amp; Raid Content<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;End Time (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1030253-End-Time-Strategy-Loot-Discussions?p=14391266#post14391266) is now available.<br>
&lt;li&gt;Hour of Twilight (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1030251-Hour-of-Twilight-Strategy-Loot-Discussions?p=14391261#post14391261) is now available.<br>
&lt;li&gt;Well of Eternity (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1030252-Well-of-Eternity-Strategy-Loot-Discussions?p=14391262#post14391262) is now available.<br>
&lt;li&gt;The new Baradin Hold boss, Alizabal, is now available.<br>
&lt;li&gt;Dragon Soul is now available.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/623-Patch-4.3-Raid-Finder/&quot;&gt;Raid Finder&lt;/a&gt;<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;This new grouping feature allows players to quickly and easily form a pick-up raid for a specially tuned version of the current tier of endgame content: the Dragon Soul raid. Raid Finder is now available.<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/622-Patch-4.3-Transmogrification/&quot;&gt;Transmogrification&lt;/a&gt;<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;This new feature allows players to customize their gear like never before. You&apos;ll find Transmogrification, Void Storage, and Reforging vendors in Cathedral Square, Stormwind and The Drag, Orgrimmar. The costs associated with this service are not yet final.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/621-Patch-4.3-Void-Storage/&quot;&gt;Void Storage&lt;/a&gt;<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;In addition to the bank, players will now have access to a new &quot;deep storage&quot; system, allowing characters to free bag space by setting aside coveted gear. You&apos;ll find Transmogrification, Void Storage, and Reforging vendors in Cathedral Square, Stormwind and The Drag, Orgrimmar. The costs associated with this service are not yet final.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Reforging<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;The former Reforging vendors have been... retired. The ethereals have chosen to take over the business and joined their Transmogrification and Void Storage service providers. You&apos;ll find them in Cathedral Square, Stormwind and The Drag, Orgrimmar.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Outland &amp;amp; Northrend Quest Flow<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;The amount of experience needed to gain levels 71 through 80 has been reduced by approximately 33%.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Many Group quests in Outland and Northrend have been re-tuned to allow players to complete them solo. They are no longer labeled as Group quests.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Relevant questgivers have been moved into Outland and Northrend dungeons. The majority of dungeon quests for these zones are now available from within their respective dungeons.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;North American realms (excluding Brazilian, Latin American, and Oceanic realms) no longer permit letters with accents in character or guild names. Existing character and guild names with special characters will be unaffected by this change.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;br /&gt;<br>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Achievements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;The achievement Master of Alterac Valley (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/1168/) no longer requires the Alterac Valley Blitz (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/226/the-alterac-blitz/) achievement.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;li&gt;<br>
&lt;p&gt;The achievement Tol Barad Veteran (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5418/) now requires 25 victories in Tol Barad, down from 100.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;br /&gt;<br>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Classes: General&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;All raid and party buffs which grant group members 10% increased attack power have been changed slightly. They continue to provide 10% increased ranged attack power, but now provide 20% increased melee attack power.<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Abomination&apos;s Might (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53138/): The melee attack power bonus from this raid buff has been increased to 10/20%, up from 5/10%. The ranged attack power bonus remains 5/10%.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Blessing of Might (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/19740/): The melee attack power bonus from this raid buff has been increased to 20%, up from 10%. The ranged attack power bonus remains 10%.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Runescroll of Might (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/67231/): The melee attack power bonus from this consumable has been increased to 16%, up from 8%. The ranged attack power bonus remains 8%.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Trueshot Aura (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/19506/): The melee attack power bonus from this raid buff has been increased to 20%, up from 10%. The ranged attack power bonus remains 10%.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Unleashed Rage (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/30808/): The melee attack power bonus from this raid buff has been increased to 10/20%, up from 5/10%. The ranged attack power bonus remains 5/10%.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Vengeance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/93098/) for Protection warriors, Protection paladins, Blood death knights, and Feral druids has been redesigned slightly. It no longer ramps up slowly at the beginning of a fight. Instead, the first melee attack taken by the tank generates Vengeance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/93098/) equal to 33% of the damage taken by that attack. In addition, as it updates periodically during the fight, it&apos;s always set to at least 33% of the damage taken by the tank in the last 2 seconds. It still climbs from that point at the rate it did previously, still decays when damage is not taken, and still cannot exceed a maximum based on the health and Stamina of the tank.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Threat generated by classes in active tanking modes has been increased to 500% damage done, up from 300%. This applies to druids in Bear Form (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/5487/), death knights in Blood Presence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48263/), warriors in Defensive Stance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/71/), and paladins with Righteous Fury (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/25781/) active.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Spells which have an effect broken by taking damage past a threshold (Entangling Roots (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/339/), Fear (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/5782/), Frost Nova (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/122/), etc.) now count damage that was prevented by damage absorbs or other damage reducing effects.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;br /&gt;<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..deathknight) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1116-Death-Knight-Cataclysm))<br>
<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Death Strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/45470/) now heals the death knight whether or not the attack misses, or is dodged/parried. As a result of this change, Death Strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/45470/) no longer refunds its rune cost if it fails to hit the target, as the death knight will still receive the healing effect.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Blood Presence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48263/) now provides an armor bonus of 55%, up from 30%.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;<br>
&lt;p&gt;Death Knight pets now properly inherit their master&#x2019;s crit and spell penetration stats.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;br /&gt;<br>
Blood<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Blade Barrier (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/49501/) has been redesigned. It now passively reduces damage taken.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Bone Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/49222/) now has 6 charges, up from 4.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Veteran of the Third War (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/50029/) now reduces the cooldown of Outbreak (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77575/) by 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;br /&gt;<br>

&lt;li&gt;Dungeon Journal entries have been added for the new dungeons: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1030253-End-Time-Strategy-Loot-Discussions?p=14391266#post14391266&quot;&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1030252-Well-of-Eternity-Strategy-Loot-Discussions?p=14391262#post14391262&quot;&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1030251-Hour-of-Twilight-Strategy-Loot-Discussions&quot;&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3516572/Patch_43_Raid_Preview_Dragon_Soul-9_19_2011&quot;&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;li&gt;Players who use Dungeon Finder for a random Heroic dungeon will no longer be locked to that instance. Previously, players who entered an instance via the Random Dungeon option were then prohibited from queuing for that dungeon or entering the instance manually via the portal. Players should now always be able to complete a specific Heroic dungeon once per day regardless of any random dungeons completed.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Ruins of Ahn&apos;qiraj<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Bosses in Ruins of Ahn&apos;qiraj now drop a rare-quality Scarab Coffer Key (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/76401/) which can be used to open the Scarab Coffers found within. These keys are zone-bound to Ruins of Ahn&apos;qiraj and have a 17-hour expiration. This change also applies to Greater Scarab Coffer Key (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/76402/)s used to open Large Scarab Coffers.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Zul&#x2019;Gurub<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Players now only have to kill two of the four initial dungeon bosses (High Priest Venoxis, Broodlord Mandokir, High Priestess Kilnara, and Zanzil) to face Jin&#x2019;do the Godbreaker.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Zul&#x2019;Aman<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Players now only have to kill two of the four Troll avatars before they may face Hex Lord Malacrass.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;br /&gt;<br>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guilds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Guild Standards are again useable in Firelands. Duration has been increased to 15 minutes, the effect has a 100 yard radius, and now affects dead players.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;br /&gt;<br>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa&apos;s Rest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71086/dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest/): The chance for this item&#x2019;s effect to be triggered has been reduced.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;br /&gt;<br>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Races&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;The orc racial Blood Fury (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/33697/) now increases spell power rather than only spell damage.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;br /&gt;<br>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;User Interface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Archaeology areas of interest will now show on the mini-map, in addition to the World Map.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Bag Search<br>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;A search field has been added to allow players to search bag, bank, guild bank, and Void Storage inventories for specific items.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Guilds with inactive guild leaders can now usurp the leader under specific conditions. More information on this coming soon.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;The Reforging interface has been updated and improved.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Quest Tracking areas or points of interest will now show on the mini-map, in addition to the World Map.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;The World Map now displays the expected character levels for each zone.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Added a &#x201C;promote everyone&#x201D; checkbox that will automatically make all raid members, Raid assistants. This checkbox can be found in the Raid Frame and the Unit Frame &#x201C;pull-out&#x201D; tab.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;li&gt;There are now commands for world markers &amp;amp; unit markers.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Added new rotation, zoom, and pan controls are now available in all windows with player models in UI frames.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Players can now unlearn profession specialization without unlearning the profession (Engineering &amp;amp; Alchemy).&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;[Mac] Added functionality to allow using the Command key instead of the Control key on Apple keyboards. This can be enabled in Mac Options.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;[Mac] Added functionality to disable Mac OS system keyboard shortcuts so that they do not interfere with keyboard shortcuts in WoW. This can be enabled in Mac Options.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Added a feature to interact with NPCs, game objects (mailbox, mining nodes, etc.), and corpses on left-click as well as right-click. There is now an option under Interface:Controls to turn this feature off.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;</div></div>
