Patch 4.0.3a Hotfixes - December 2<br>
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a. While many have already been deployed on all realms, some may not be implemented until the next time your realm is restarted. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.<br>

<br>
Rake is now dealing the same damage outside of Cat Form when the druid has the Razor Claws mastery. Rake damage also stays consistent when modified by Mangle as a druid shifts out of Cat Form.<br>
The proc buff from the talent Shooting Stars should no longer be consumed without providing its benefits if the druid is already casting Starsurge.<br>

<br>
Silithid Swarmers are now tamable by hunters.<br>
Hunter pets that changed pet families prior to patch 4.0.3 will no longer retain their previous talents on top of the new Cataclysm pet talents. Hunters will have to untalent their pets to pick up this correction.<br>

<br>
Smite&apos;s scaling coefficient has been increased. The damage of Smite is now very similar to Heal in value. This change has been made to ensure the Archangel Discipline sub-specialization remains viable.<br>
The presence of the Word of Glory effect from the paladin talent Guarded by the Light will no longer prevent casting or get overwritten by Power Word: Shield.<br>

City Tabards<br>
If you are wearing one of the new faction tabards (e.g. Thunder Bluff, Stormwind, Orgrimmar, Ironforge, etc.), you will only receive reputation gains for that city/faction when in Classic (1-60), Northrend (70-80), and Cataclysm (80-85) dungeons. Outland dungeons will not currently provide reputation gains for the &quot;home city&quot; faction you are championing; this is intended.<br>
<br>
Also, just as a heads up, if dungeon mobs and bosses are trivial to you, you will receive less reputation than if they are within your level range. This is just to ensure that players who exceed the dungeon&apos;s intended level range can still benefit from championing a specific faction, but aren&apos;t given a distinct advantage over those who are of the appropriate level and are unable to solo the content. This should also help encourage players to improve their reputation in dungeons more appropriate for their level, rather than running lower level content solely for the reputation (which isn&apos;t a bad thing by any means; we just want you to enjoy the content designed for your level range, too). :)<br>
<br>
[...] For a period of time after patch 4.0.3a launched, Wrath of the Lich King dungeons did not provide reputation gains if a new faction tabard was worn. This was hotfixed, however, shortly after Sapperwix&apos;s post on November 24: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/1232869#blog<br>
<br>
After speaking with our designers further (as promised earlier in this thread) and reexamining how our hotfix was applied together, Inushi was indeed correct and new faction tabards will only provide reputation gains for the championed city in Northrend if the dungeon is Heroic or otherwise level 80. This is how the current tabard system works for Wrath of the Lich King, but we may consider revising the system to include all dungeons, regardless of level, in a future patch.<br>
<br>
Apologies for the confusion! I&apos;ve already amended my first post to ensure it reflects this information. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/138803/city-tabards-and-bc-dungeons))<br>
<br>
This still doesn&apos;t answer why no rep with regular non 80 wrath instances while wearing the city tabard.<br>
Similar to Outland dungeons, there are technical limitations which we must first overcome for this to be possible. It&apos;s a bit complicated, but hopefully I can explain.<br>
<br>
In Wrath of the Lich King, we implemented a system that allowed players to champion factions by wearing a corresponding tabard; however, that system was limited and only supported level 80 dungeons (including Heroics). Fortunately, we were able to incorporate the new city tabards into this system through a hotfix, but the same rules and restrictions still apply. If we want to allow the new city tabards to provide reputations gains in all Northrend dungeons, we&apos;ll have to completely retrofit the entire Wrath of the Lich King tabard system -- which is something we may consider tackling in a future patch.

Disconnected in Battlegrounds / Deserter debuff<br>
This is a bug for which we have developed a hotfix. Unless you type &quot;/logout&quot; while in a Battleground, you should be given a three-minute grace period when disconnected to log back in without the Deserter debuff.<br>
<br>
This hotfix is not yet active on live realms as it will require cross-realm restarts. It should be fixed by tomorrow. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/139489/please-do-something-about-the-battlegrounds))<br>

Beginner Tooltips<br>
For a veteran gamer like yourself, it&apos;s understandable that the Beginner Tooltips might be a bit jarring. But, before you write them off as an embarassment, think back to when you first began playing World of Warcraft. Or, if you were already familiar with MMORPGs at the time, think back instead to when you were initially introduced to another complex gaming environment. It was likely a bit overwhelming.<br>
<br>
Between clicking all the interface buttons, discovering how the combat system operates, learning how to move your character, adjusting those complex camera angles, and figuring out why that knight over there is wearing an exclamation point as a hat, there&apos;s a lot of data for new players to process -- and those first few minutes of playing, prior to our most recent improvements, could sometimes feel like you were getting shot in the face. In the face.<br>
<br>
You may have had a different experience, of course -- and if you did, that&apos;s awesome! -- but for a number of new players, their introduction to World of Warcraft was a bit disorienting. No bueno! To help combat that early game confusion, we streamlined a lot of beginning content including tooltips, ensuring that the first set you see when you log in clearly describes what a specific type of spell or ability actually does. In combination with other quest and UI enhancements, the entire new player experience is now more meaningful and better at introducing game mechanics to those who are otherwise unfamiliar with them.<br>
<br>
Now, if you&apos;re wondering why Beginner Tooltips is selected by default, this is because new players -- those who would most thoroughly benefit from this feature -- probably aren&apos;t going to know how or where to turn them on. While this may sometimes catch our more seasoned adventurers off-guard, we know you guys have an understanding of how to modify in-game settings and can likely deduce how to disable them on your own, either by poking around the interface menu or by asking for assistance on our community forums. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/139578/spell-skill-and-ability-descriptions))<br>

Glyphs and new players<br>
(Perhaps one suggestion I could make would be for a class trainer to give you a set of 3 glyphs appropriate to your spec - but make these new, weaker glyphs - worth using but also worth replacing as soon as you can afford to.)<br>
I think that&apos;s actually a pretty kickass suggestion, and one I will bring up. I don&apos;t doubt it&apos;s something that&apos;s been thought of already, but may bear repeating. (repeating bear says *rawr*)<br>
<br>
Having a character customization/power system dependent on the market means there is going to be a rub when asking new players to spend their new-player amounts of cash on well-aged-game inflation rates. I also don&apos;t think it&apos;s realistic to think that new players are going to make inscription buddies or choose inscription (or maybe any profession) themselves.<br>
<br>
Of course the use of glyphs is really not going to make or break the game for you while leveling, and really maybe even at late levels/end-game to varying degrees. It&apos;s potentially also a stretch to think that it will be completely forgotten. BUT! fundamentally, good idea. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/139575/glyphs-at-25-a-cruel-joke))<br>
