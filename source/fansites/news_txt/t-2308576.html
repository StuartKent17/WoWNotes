If I have 2 relics both with the Torment of the weak passive, do I get 2 separate stacks or more uptime on 1?<br>
When you have multiple relics with that trait, it&apos;s the damage that is increased. There should still only be one debuff on the target. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/909867754768891908))<br>

Game Developer Tweets<br>
Do you think there is a direct correlation between power without gameplay and lowered satisfaction?<br>
Absolutely, but it won&#x2019;t manifest immediately. In the short term, being overpowered and hard to counter feels great. You&#x2019;re winning a lot without having to work as hard at it. It&#x2019;s a rush. But it&#x2019;s a temporary sugar rush. Later you start to lose interest and aren&#x2019;t sure why. <br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s the same feeling the first time you turn on god mode on any game. I ran through Contra once with invincibility on and sort of lost interest. When I first went to work on WoW, I poked around in all of the raid instances to see how the bosses were actually built (like how did Deep Breath actually work), but it wasn&#x2019;t fun to go around and one-shot them all with dev tools. Wooo. I&#x2019;m so powerful. Crickets.<br>
<br>
I should also add that it&#x2019;s possible to have abilities or mechanics that can still feel satisfying to use even if the champion overall has too much power without gameplay. Abilities that are responsive, that have good visuals and audio that match your expectations, and have good feedback, can be satisfying. That doesn&#x2019;t mean the whole character package is though. (Source (https://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/162959906368/do-you-think-there-is-a-direct-correlation))<br>
