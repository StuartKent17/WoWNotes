Unholy Determination Feat of Strength Removed
Unholy Determination Removed
This Feat of Strength http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11669-unholy-determination wasn’t actually intended to go live. We’d decided some time ago that it didn’t really fit in line with our philosophies regarding achievements, particularly due to the non-repeatable nature of the Class Mount questline. Once 7.2.5 is released, it will no longer be granted, and will be removed from players who had already received it.

I can appreciate that no-one likes having something taken away from them. To try and clarify a little bit why we came to this decision; during the course of the PTR testing feedback from the community overwhelmingly pointed out that a missable achievement was both unfun for players that missed it, and unfun for players that felt compelled to slaughter innocent red dragons to achieve it.

I do also want to mention that, while the Feat of Strength will be removed, the special voice line from Bolvar will still play if players choose to follow this particular route.

Are you going to remove Black Harvest FoS too because you can no longer get it?
This isn't really an appropriate comparison.

The Breaker of the Black Harvest FoS was awarded to players who managed to earn green fire during Mists of Pandaria before the Warlords of Draenor pre-patch. Like all the other similar Feats of Strength, it is a reward for accomplishing such feats.

The Unholy Determination FoS which was awarded for doing an optional objective in the Death Knight Class Mount campaign was not supposed to go live for the reasons already mentioned in this thread, it was a mistake that it did go live which is why it's now being removed.

The actual content will still remain in the game, the optional objective is still there and you will still get the additional dialogue if you choose to complete it. Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17615664181?page=4#67

Unholy Determination FoS Removed in 7.2.5
Feedback from the community noted that a missable achievement was unfun for the players that missed it. While we've chosen to remove the Feats of Strength granted in the questlines overall, the voice line from Bolvar will still play if players do choose to go down this path as Death Knights.

As was alluded to, these Feats were not meant to go live, as we had previously decided that they were misaligned with our general look towards achievements, namely that they were unobtainable if missed in a non-repeatable quest area. Again, these will no longer be obtainable in 7.2.5, and for players who did obtain the achievement it will be removed.

Hidden Wyrmtongue Cache Campaign Quest Hotfix
Yep, to confirm this was indeed hotfixed to only require 5 caches. The ? above Khadgar's head will be grey but you should still be able to turn the quest in.

As to the why: A client side patch is needed to update the quest text and the turn-in indicator. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1063762-hidden-wyrmtongue-cache-no-credit/ / Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17615684434?page=1#5

7.2.5 Enhancement Class Discussion
It's ambiguous whether SS should attempt to proc Stormbringer once or twice. While we normally try to be generous with things that could go either way--one of the specific concerns driving the Enhancement changes in this patch is that Stormbringer's mechanics caused "feast-or-famine" proc outcomes. That is, because Stormstrike itself was one of the few spells that procced Stormbringer, a proc made more upcoming procs likely, and lack of a proc made upcoming procs less likely. This sort of positive feedback in a proc chance essentially the opposite of bad luck protection is something that should generally be avoided.

Stormstrike having twice the proc chance of any other button would have a similar concern. I understand that, viewed in isolation, adding it would be a welcome power increase--but that's neither here nor there. As always, the spec can be tuned with either proc mechanic, so the important question is what's better for pacing long-term. If it turns out more total DPS is needed or even if, for example, more frequent procs would be an improvement, there are likely better ways to accomplish it.

If by happenstance some talent rows might be better balanced right now if we doubled Stormstrike's chance to proc Stormbringer I assume this means L75 and/or L100, that's something to look into if needed. But similarly, it's not a good reason to make a change that has other ramifications longer-term.
