Marksmanship Hunters,<br>
<br>
Hello again, a few notes this morning.<br>
<br>
- Aimed Shot should still be a 12 second recharge time before Haste, I&apos;m unsure why some people are reporting it is showing up as 10 seconds for them. Is this still happening after the build that went up yesterday?<br>
<br>
- After lots of discussion and reading feedback and many dungeon runs and raid testing and questing, we have decided that we&apos;re going to changed Aimed Shot to 2.5 second cast time, and Steady Shot to 1.75 second cast time. <br>
<br>
- Regarding Lone Wolf and Pet Utility, if you have your active pet out, the Command Pet button in your spellbook should change into whatever your pet&apos;s special ability is, such as Primal Rage. If you dismiss your pet as a Marksmanship Hunter and opt into Lone Wolf, Command Pet should change into Survival of the Fittest as a cooldown you can use that reduces damage taken on you and your pet by 20%. This looks to have some issues currently, and will be resolved in a future build.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the continued feedback on this thread and others.<br>

Epic Battlegrounds Plans in Battle for Azeroth<br>
If Epic Battlegrounds do not have a good reward to encourage sign ups and are not adjusted to last longer, we risk sitting in queue for longer than games last. That sucks from a game play perspective. I personally would be very unhappy to have a game last 12 minutes after being in queue for 20.<br>
We&apos;ll be changing the rewards for Epic Battlegrounds to be better than normal battlegrounds. There is also going to be a weekly quest for Conquest to do a Epic Battleground. (Blue Tracker[/b] (]Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20762238127?page=3#46))<br>
<br>
Pre-patch AVs are the best. Basically when all the NPCs are tuned for 10 levels higher. Pre-patch BfA you will see guards and bosses tuned to 120 so we will have the nice, long AVs.<br>
We just placed scaling tech on the creatures in Alterac Valley so that their difficulty scales with your character power. This should cause the creatures to retain their difficulty throughout the expansion cycle. Let us know how this feels!

Blizzard&apos;s Nazmir Official Preview<br>
Once the shining heart of troll civilization, Nazmir is now a bleak swamp riddled with ruined reminders of its former greatness. In the current troll capital of Zuldazar, stories are passed down from generation to generation cautioning children to behave, lest Nazmir&#x2019;s twisted practioners of blood magic come to snatch them from their beds. And those who dare brave the swamp have a terrible habit of disappearing, never to return. The blood trolls of Nazmir are the monsters that haunt every Zandalari child&#x2019;s nightmares&#x2014;and for good reason.<br>
<br>
Welcome to Nazmir.<br>
<br>
Nazmir is a primordial swampland, replete with a diverse ecology of insects and dangerous beasts. Many of the once grand temples and buildings now lay in ruins, scattered throughout the region like broken teeth. Vegetation has encroached upon the stone walls and buildings, reclaiming the land piece by piece. Your treacherous journey alongside Princess Talanji begins along one of Nazmir&#x2019;s many broken and waterlogged pathways.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
It is here that the blood trolls perform vile rituals in tribute to their blood god G&#x2019;Huun. While the Zandalari King Rastakhan and his advisors have ignored this threat for too long, his daughter, Princess Talanji, is prepared to take this menace head-on&#x2014;and aligning with the four loa in Nazmir may be the only answer.<br>
<br>
Your first mission: seek out the bat loa Hi&#x2019;reek, the loa of death Bwonsamdi, the turtle loa Torga, and the frog loa Krag&#x2019;wa, and appeal to them for help&#x2014;if they can give it.<br>
<br>
The blood trolls present a serious threat to the Zandalari. With the power of their blood god, they seek to destroy the great troll nation&#x2014;and potentially spread beyond their island borders. They fuel their voodoo with profane blood rituals, harnessing undead monstrosities to do their bidding. Many who enter the swamps do not leave, instead becoming a sacrifice to G&#x2019;huun.<br>
<br>
Sodden marshes and tributaries mark the landscape of Nazmir, fed by the grand waterfalls spilling from the cliffs of Zuldazar high above. The Razorjaw River and Shattered River both wind through Nazmir as well, contributing to the marshes and wetlands that dominate the region.<br>
<br>
Things to Try: Feel Free to Forage<br>
Keep a keen eye out for edible plants and other items throughout the region which can provide a small boost to your powers as you travel. You may need all the help you can get as you make your way deeper into the swamp.<br>
<br>
Each step in your search for the loa of this region will take you further into the heart of blood troll territory&#x2014;and provide an opportunity to demonstrate to the Zandalari the value of the Horde as their allies. <br>
<br>
LOA DO CALL TO YOU<br>
Allying with Bwonsamdi, the Loa of Death, comes with advantages. But as with any deal with death, it also comes at a steep price. <br>
<br>
In the area surrouding Bwonsamdi&#x2019;s temple, blood troll strongholds and villages burble with the blood of their victims, and evidence of their depravities mar the landscape. These signs serve as a warning and declaration that the blood trolls are to be feared&#x2014;that they are the ultimate power within Nazmir, and that those who do not bend to their will will be destroyed.<br>
<br>

<br>
Did you know?<br>
&#x201C;Ma&#x2019;da&#x201D; in Zandali means &#x201C;mother.&#x201D; Though not a term distinct to the blood trolls, the males of the tribe use it as a term of respect for the females of their society.<br>
<br>
You won&#x2019;t be the only one braving the fury of the blood trolls, however. Always in search of a good story, the tortollans make a regular pilgrimage to visit the turtle loa Torga despite the omnipresent danger the blood trolls pose. Don&#x2019;t let their enthusiasm for a rousing yarn fool you, though; they are able allies in the fight against the blood trolls&#x2014;especially if they think they&#x2019;ll emerge with a worthwhile tale to tell.<br>
<br>
Blessings of the loa be upon you as you make your way ultimately into the Underrot (a 5-player dungeon in Nazmir)&#x2014;you&#x2019;re going to need it as you take on the horrors that fester within.<br>
<br>

<br>
A vast coastline surrounds Nazmir to the north and east, with the Shattered River demarking the southern border along Zuldazar, all offering bountiful opportunities for fishing, hunting, swimming, and treasure hunting. To the west you&#x2019;ll find the bubbling Shoaljai Tar Pits, where the cloying scent of smoke drifts up from vents within the earth, choking the air with a haze of ash and dust. Just west of the tar pits on the westernmost border, the pathway into the arid desert of Vol&#x2019;dun awaits, offering even more opportunities to earn your way into the good graces of the Zandalari.<br>

Tune In June 9&#x2013;10 for the WoW Arena World Championship: European Qualifier Cup 3<br>
The Arena World Championship Summer Season continues on Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/warcraft) this weekend with the European Cup Qualifier #3. We&#x2019;ve got all the information you need on where to watch and which teams to keep an eye on this weekend.<br>
<br>
Ascending Victory: Interview with Akrololz of Ascendant<br>
In the second European Cup of the summer, Ascendant denied Method Black their fourth consecutive cup win. We caught up with Ascendant&#x2019;s Rogue player &#x2018;Akrololz&#x2019; to discuss the thrilling seven-game grand final series of Rogue/Mage/Priest mirrors.<br>
<br>
What do you look for as a Rogue to win in an RMP [Rogue/Mage/Priest] mirror match?<br>
Akrololz: In mirrors, Rogue is required to do a lot&#x2014;you have to stop enemies&#x2019; goes*, and at the same time Rogues have to lead a lot, and do goes. It&#x2019;s important to make the game sometimes by going from defense to offense, so I have to force my Priest or Mage to push for Kidney Shot into Polymorph or Psychic Scream. As a Rogue, you can also reverse games by stopping enemy Priest fears [Psychic Screams] with Kidney Shot, which can sometimes enable your Priest to fear and instantly reverse a go. You can also win the game with unpredictable Smoke Bombs, and flawless Kicks on enemy mage including his frost school to deny Ice Block.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
*A &#x201C;go&#x201D; refers to an offensive setup in which team uses their crowd control to prevent the healer from healing. This can only happen occassionally in Rogue/Mage/Priest mirrors because of Kidney Shot&#x2019;s cooldown and diminishing returns on crowd control.<br>
<br>
How is it to play against a Rogue as good as Whaazz on the opposition?<br>
Akrololz: It&#x2019;s really hard to play against Whaazz in mirrors. His team members all play it really well, and Whaazz knows exactly what he has to do, so the challenge is always really high between me and him. Every time when we lose a game to each other, we also learn something new from each other. We&#x2019;re both trying to do our best to win the game.<br>
<br>
How confident are you going into the Summer Finals?<br>
Akrololz: We are ready and prepared for the Summer Finals; if meta doesn&#x2019;t change, I think we have really good chances to win this LAN.<br>
<br>
With their victory in European Cup 2, Ascendant are all but assured to qualify for their 2nd seasonal finals of the year.<br>

Blue Posts<br>
Remember PvP weekends?<br>
If you have played this game long enough you remember AB, AV, WSG weekends where you earned bonus rep with those pvp factions. I envision something similar but to earn the bonus you actually need to go to the original post for AB, AV, and WSG. The rep needs to be updated and can include pvp posts, flasks, food, and recipies. I know that it isn&apos;t a perfect idea but with enough positive support this idea could work for almost all the battle grounds. I would exclude the 40 man ones, 100%. This idea might work with the proper incentives and would invigorate old content.<br>
Our thought was that the Brawls feature provides some of that gameplay, where a battleground is in the spotlight for a bit. Granted, not all battlegrounds have a brawl but we still plan on adding more as time goes on.<br>
<br>
One thing we&apos;ve added in Battle for Azeroth is &quot;Call to Arms&quot; for War Mode. Each week will be a different zone quest to kill a number of the opposing faction for a conquest reward (both Horde and Alliance are sent to the same zone). You can find it in the hubs in Boralus and Zuldazar. (Blue Tracker[/b] (]Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20765027479?page=1#6))<br>
