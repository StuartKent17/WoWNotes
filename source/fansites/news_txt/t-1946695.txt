So... how can there be three major land based civs and multiple land based races on a few isles that was raised only 20/30y ago?
The Tomb of Sargeras was raised. Other parts of the Broken Isles in Legion expansion have been around since the Sundering. DaveKosak 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
I feel that the class homogenization, "bring the player, not class" policy, LFR and Norm/Hero/Mythic difficulties Blizzard had all the good intentions, but they backfired, hard, causing more harm than good, changing the community's mindset in a way difficult to undo. Do you have a similar sentiment? 
I agree that offering multiple difficulty levels for end-game PVE content has been challenging. It's not okay for some players to just not have an endgame. On the other hand, it's possible to make something epic feel not epic if you can reduce it to punching bag status with a slider. I don't have a good solution here, and to be fair, I haven't thought about it a lot in some time.

I still think "bring the player" was the right call. We were in a world where many specs and some classes just couldn't argue for a raid spot and others were brought just for their fabulous buffs or utility. I don't think some kind of group buff arms race is the right call either. Would you rather have Blessing of Kings or Might? Probably Kings. Sorry paladin number 2, but we need to sit you and bring a hunter.

In terms of role, maybe there was a way to keep Paladins as the AE tanks and single target healers. Maybe if there had been multiple endgames then there could be more variety. It sounds like the current devs are trying to differentiate the classes more without making any unviable which is a great goal. But I do think letting more classes do dungeons and raids was the right call at the time. Thoughts?
For me it meant that having a good, reliable person at your side should be more important than the class that they play.
That was the goal. My first guild had 5 highly skilled rogues. It was lame to exclude them just because of their class choice. OccupyGStreet 


Computers - Setup of the Month
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices  are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. New GPUs may be coming towards the middle of this year

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 6700K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions!
