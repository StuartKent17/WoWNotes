Items<br>
<br>

<br>
Developers&#x2019; note: We like fun holiday buffs adding flavor to the game and we don&#x2019;t want to prevent them from being used in raids and dungeons. We also don&#x2019;t like unusable items taking up inventory space the rest of the year. We expect to make future holiday buff items follow the same pattern.<br>
