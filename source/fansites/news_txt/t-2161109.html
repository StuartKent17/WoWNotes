Kirin Tor Tavern Crawl Disabled<br>
The Kirin Tor Tavern Crawl micro-holiday is unfortunately suffering from some issues that didn&#x2019;t come up in PTR testing, and we have been unable to correct via hotfix. As such, we&apos;ve had to disable it. Apologies for the inconvenience!<br>
<br>
<br>
PvP Brawls With The Blues!<br>
Over the next few weeks, we&#x2019;ll be jumping into 7.2&#x2019;s new PvP Brawls on the Public Test Realm, and you&#x2019;re invited to join us!<br>
<br>
Several members of the World of Warcraft development, quality assurance, and community teams will be queuing for PvP Brawls between 3 PM and 5 PM Pacific (6 PM and 8 PM Eastern) every Friday, starting on February 3rd and continuing through February 17th. If you&#x2019;d like to join, simply log into the PTR and queue for a Brawl during that time.<br>
<br>
Blizzard employees will be identified in game by their guild (either &lt;Blizzard Alliance&gt; or &lt;Blizzard Horde&gt;). We&#x2019;re looking forward to having you fighting alongside us -- or sending us to the graveyard -- in the Brawls!<br>
<br>

Crafted Legendary Items in 7.2<br>
Crafted legendary items (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6297-Mythic-Nighthold-Patch-7-2-Quests-and-Crafted-Legendary-Items-Heroes-of-the-Dorm) are coming in Patch 7.2, but they aren&apos;t ready to be previewed just yet. <br>
What you&apos;re seeing through datamining regarding these items right now is EXTREMELY unfinished -- that&apos;s why we haven&apos;t enabled them for testing on the PTR yet, and currently don&apos;t plan to for at least a couple weeks. I wouldn&apos;t take their current state as anything more than &quot;there will probably be some Legendary items obtainable through crafting.&quot;<br>
<br>
They should make a lot more sense once they&apos;re in a more fleshed-out state. I&apos;d love to be able to share more details now but, frankly, they&apos;re so early in the design process that most of the details don&apos;t yet exist.<br>

Artifact Power in Patch 7.2<br>
You mention that &quot;Completing this quest chain will consume any ranks beyond 35, increase the overall power of your Artifact Weapon (to ensure that losing ranks 35+ isn&#x2019;t a downgrade)&quot;. How will this work for players with rank between 35 and 54? Will they never be able to get as strong a weapon as those who got to Rank 54 before the refund? Or will it be just a flat increase to the power of everyone&apos;s artifact weapon, regardless of the rank they had? (Ie. a player with Rank 37 will get just as much of an increase than a player with Rank 54, the only difference being how much AP they have due to the refunded Ranks).<br>
It will be a flat increase.<br>
<br>
The person who currently has Rank 54 will still have a stronger overall weapon though due to the fact that they will receive more refunded Artifact Power, thus immediately being able to purchase more of the new traits than someone who was at Rank 37 before 7.2. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/795220-maxed-out-weapon-on-ap-what-to-do-with-ap/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17614784157?page=3#42))<br>

Artifact Power in Patch 7.2<br>
if i use AP-items and save up points on an artifact without using them, will i be able to put them into the new talents when they are available?Yes, but there&apos;s no benefit in doing this:<br>
<br>
You&apos;ll need to have reached the 35th trait in order to unlock the new traits Any AP you&apos;ve spent on traits 35-54 will be refunded when you unlock the new traits (as the 35th trait is consumed in order to unlock them), so you&apos;ll be able to re-spend that AP immediately<br>
This week&apos;s build should have the 7.2 traits available, should hopefully be a lot more clear once you can see how it works in-game.<br>
<br>
2 issues:<br>
- Before 7.1.5 players were at rank 54 and put more AP into the weapon<br>
- Players can stay at rank 53 and keep adding AP to the weapon<br>
<br>
So players have more AP in the weapon than 54 ranks require. What&apos;ll happen to this &quot;extra&quot; AP? Will it also be refunded or &quot;deleted&quot;?<br>
The current Artifact Power cap is based on total amount of AP, not on number of ranks purchased. Once you have enough AP to buy your 54th rank, you&apos;ll no longer be able to add additional AP, regardless of whether you actually buy that final rank or not.<br>
<br>
Any additional AP beyond 54 will not be refunded. The core intent here is that you cannot farm Artifact Power beyond what is useful in Patch 7.1.5 until Patch 7.2 releases.

Class Mounts<br>
does the druid mount replace the flight form or is it a seperate button?<br>
separate button but acts a lot like flight form (instant cast, etc) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/822284475639828480))<br>
<br>
Ok, actually the Blazing Disc looks great. Though I was hoping it&apos;d be made entirely of fire! XD Still! Will it leave a trail?<br>
.each of the little fiery balls leaves a trail, also each mount of each class has custom summon and dismiss spell effects (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/822283849564450817))<br>
what about the frost mage mount? Does it leave a frosty trail?<br>
yes (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/822292195956772865))<br>
<br>
With this in mind, will the shaman mounts have different element variants?<br>
yes (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/822285238940246016))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
Did you change or remove PvP Templates yet? I&apos;m still waiting for it!<br>
Templates have been good for balance/accessibility, bad for feeling of customization. Gear/AP/Honor still provide progression. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/822497847085920256))<br>
Some things we can improve with templates but overall happy with direction. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/822498281800417280))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
Are there any requirements for the &quot;challenge mode&quot; version of the Pet Battle Dungeon?<br>
3 max level pets (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/822670880316669952))<br>
Over 3 level pets and don&apos;t have access to it. Thanks for all the work you put forward for the pet battle community!<br>
shoot I think I&apos;m wrong, what did the Celestial Tourney require? 10? Maybe that? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/822679423841275905))<br>

ffxGlow still doesnt turn off invis effect, which is the one that makes me vomit (this one)Glad to&#x2026; https://t.co/4rOXpJ8HcO<br>
