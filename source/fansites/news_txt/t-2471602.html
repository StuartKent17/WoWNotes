Patch 8.1.5 - Tides of Vengeance Content Update Notes<br>
Allied Races - Kul Tiran Humans and Zandalari Trolls Now Available<br>
Take the final steps to bring new comrades into your faction. Level 120 players who wish to create a Kul Tiran will need to reach Exalted with Proudmoore Admiralty and earn the achievements A Nation United and Tides of Vengeance. Those wanting to create a Zandalari character must be level 120, reach Exalted with Zandalari Empire and earn the Zandalar Forever! and Tides of Vengeance achievements. Once you complete the requirements, visit the Alliance embassy in Stormwind or Horde embassy in Orgrimmar to begin a quest chain to recruit these new Allied races.<br>
<br>
Kul Tiras was founded by fearless explorers who sailed uncharted waters in search of adventure. As a key member of the Alliance of Lordaeron, the Kul Tiran navy dominated the seas of Azeroth with its legendary fleet.<br>
<br>
The Zandalari are a proud people whose origins date back to the early days of Azeroth&apos;s history. Their fierce warriors ride dinosaurs into battle, and they possess one of the most formidable naval fleets in the known world.<br>
<br>
Leveling your new Kul Tiran or Zandalari from 20 to 110 will earn you a unique cosmetic Heritage Armor set. You&#x2019;ll also unlock a new mount&#x2014;the Kul Tiran Charger or Zandalari Direhorn&#x2014;for your collection at character creation.<br>

Enemies of the opposite faction in Zandalar and Kul Tiras now drop invitations, and a new vendor named A. Shady occasionally has them for sale in Orgrimmar and Stormwind. Brawler&#x2019;s Guild has new bosses, a new questline, new transmog gear to be won, and a new mount: Bruce! He&#x2019;s a good boy.<br>

Creatures<br>

<br>

<br>
Added Island Expedition armor tokens to the Seafarer&apos;s Dubloon vendor for players leveling through islands to create gear for their item level. The tokens are Bind on Account so players with excess Dubloons can buy them and send them to their alts. <br>
Updated Seafarer&apos;s Dubloon bags so that at least one will always drop from an Island Expedition victory. This change significantly increases the amount of Dubloons a player will get as they complete their weekly islands.<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Krom Stoutarm in Ironforge&#x2019;s Hall of Explorers and Estelle Gendry on Orgrimmar&#x2019;s main gate now offer new Battle-Hardened Heirloom upgrade tokens that will allow your Heirlooms to scale to level 120.<br>

Incandescent Sliver and Diamond-Laced Refracting Prism trinket buffs are now cleared consistently on encounter, arena, and battleground start.<br>
<br>
<br>
Developers&apos; notes: It was not our intention that these items require extra preparation prior to a boss pull. The Diamond-Laced Refracting Prism&#x2019;s effect was already cleared at the start of a rated PvP match, so this change makes them both consistent between PvP and non-PvP encounters. We have increased the effect of the Sliver by 6% and the Prism by 15% to offset this change in behavior.<br>
<br>

<br>
Warlock<br>
<br>
Destruction<br>
<br>
Demon Armor now increases Armor by 150% (was 275%).<br>
<br>
<br>
During Battle for Azeroth Season 1, we identified that Warlocks were taking too much damage from physical sources during PvP. We remedied this by adding a new PvP talent, Demon Armor, which increased their physical mitigation to match characters wearing Plate Armor. As we&apos;ve been monitoring Season 2, we feel that the armor increase caused Warlocks to become too tanky in the current meta. This change effectively brings their physical mitigation close to that of Mail Armor (about 36% at ilvl 415), when it was previously similar to Plate Armor (about 45% at ilvl 415).<br>
<br>
