Some issues with the servers were fixed during the night, loading times should be much better than in the last two days. If you want to compare, you can check the CPU Load graph (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/june/cpu.jpg), I think you&apos;ll understand when the problem was solved. ^^<br>

New features are being developed nicely, I think I used that twice in the last two weeks, but the new big thing should be available &quot;soon&quot; (and hopefully next week if I can find a few more whips).</div></div>
