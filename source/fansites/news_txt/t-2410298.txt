A new Hearthstone expansion is on the way, featuring Dr. Boom https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dr._Boom! It'll be ready on August 7 2018.


Magnetic Minions can be played on their own, but if you have a mech on the board you can play a Magnetic minion and fuse it to the mech to add to its health, attack, and add an ability. 
Projects are new spell cards with extremely powerful effects, but they help both players.
Omega Project - These cards are normal, but have a Battlecry that works when you have 10 Mana Crystals.
There will be legendary spells, such as one that draws your entire deck!
