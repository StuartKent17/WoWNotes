<br>
Small update tonight, just like any other friday night we might see a new patch on beta servers. Stay tuned !<br>
<br>
Beta Realms - Maintenance 9/5/08<br>
We will be taking down the Beta realms at 10:30AM Pacific time today September 5th 2008 for maintenance.<br>
<br>
We expect this process to take from six to eight hours.<br>
We&apos;re going to try to patch today. <br>
Icecrown, the exterior zone, will be shipped out with the expansion. Icecrown Citadel, the dungeon/raid experience, will be part of a future patch. <br>
Storm Peaks will be in this patch. If it continues to crash the server, we&apos;ll have to turn it off again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Premade Characters<br>
Premades weren&apos;t supposed to be active today<br>
Actually, the premades being available on the existing realms was a mistake. They are being removed. There will be a specific premade realm. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/9641624570-beta-concerns-regarding-premades.html))<br>
<br>
Premade Realm<br>
Murmur will be the new Premade realm. Premades will be removed from &quot;Northrend&quot; and &quot;Lich King&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/9658135792-murmer.html))<br>
<br>
XP Tuning<br>
The XP tuning is getting closer. We&apos;re going to do a minor adjustment in today&apos;s patch. 10% faster.</div></div>
