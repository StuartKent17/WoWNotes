The PTR testing schedule has been updated. The Flame Leviathan encounter was heavily bugged when it was tested on PTR yesterday and it wouldn&apos;t be surprising to see a new build deployed on PTRs tonight or early tomorrow to fix the issues before the testing. Stay tuned? <br>
Here&apos;s the current schedule for Ulduar PTR testing:<br>
<br>
On the North American test realms:<br>
<br>
Flame Leviathan - Tuesday Night, March 24, starting at 7pm EDT/4pm PDT.<br>
Hodir (Hard Mode) - Wednesday Night, March 25, starting at 7pm EDT/4pm PDT.<br>
<br>
On the European test realms:<br>
<br>
Flame Leviathan - Tuesday Night, March 24 at 19:00 CET.<br>
General Vezax (Hard Mode) - Wednesday Night, March 25 at 19:00 CET.<br>
<br>
Emalon the Storm Watcher is also available to be tested in the Vault of Archavon depending on PTR Wintergrasp status. Test Patchwerks will also be available on Wednesday.<br>
<br>
For Hard Mode testing, Shirts of Uber (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?item=45280) will be available on Ursula McWeaksauce to help simulate a raid having obtained Ulduar gear. Check the entrance area of Ulduar for the vendor.<br>
<br>
This schedule could change at a moment&apos;s notice due to server, bug, or patch status. I&apos;ll try to keep everyone informed as much as possible. Ulduar and the bosses to be tested will remain also open a variable length of time. How long they stay open depends upon a host of factors including designer availability, bug status, etc. We&apos;re very interested in seeing combat logs and parses for all raid testing on the PTR.<br>
<br>

Emalon the Stormwatcher<br>
It&apos;s probably a good time to talk about Emalon, a new wing has been added to the Vault of Archavon with Patch 3.1. The end boss is Emalon the Stormwatcher (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/emalon.jpg).<br>
