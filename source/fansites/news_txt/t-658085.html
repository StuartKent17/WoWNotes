LOS ANGELES, Calif. &#x2013; July 22, 2009 -- Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. and Legendary Pictures announced today that Sam Raimi has signed on to direct the eagerly-anticipated major motion picture based on Blizzard Entertainment&#xAE;&#x2019;s award-winning Warcraft&#xAE; universe. Raimi has, in the course of his career, clearly demonstrated a genius for developing and adapting existing fictional universes for mainstream audiences while staying true to the spirit of the original content.<br>
<br>
Raimi directed the Spider-Man trilogy, which has broken box-office records around the world and garnered five Academy Award&#xAE; nominations. Known for his imaginative filmmaking style, richly drawn characters and offbeat humor, Raimi wrote and directed the cult classic, The Evil Dead and produced 30 Days Of Night. He most recently wrote and directed the supernatural thriller, Drag Me To Hell.<br>
<br>
&quot;At its core, Warcraft is a fantastic, action-packed story,&quot; said Raimi. &quot;I am thrilled to work with such a dynamite production team to bring this project to the big screen.&quot;<br>
<br>
Charles Roven&#x2019;s producing talents were recently seen with last summer&#x2019;s blockbuster The Dark Knight, which grossed in excess of $1 billion, was nominated for eight Academy Awards&#xAE; and won two. His body of work also includes the widely acclaimed Batman Begins and the sci-fi classic 12 Monkeys. Roven, with Atlas producing partner Alex Gartner, will be producing with Legendary Pictures CEO Thomas Tull, Legendary&#x2019;s Chief Creative Officer Jon Jashni, Raimi and Raimi&#x2019;s producing partner Joshua Donen. Raimi&#x2019;s partner, Robert Tapert, will be an Executive Producer and Blizzard Entertainment&#x2019;s Senior Vice President of Creative Development, Chris Metzen, a Co-Producer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Partnering with Sam Raimi exemplifies Legendary&apos;s mandate of marrying the highest quality intellectual property to world-class filmmakers&quot; said Legendary&#x2019;s Tull. &quot;Sam&apos;s passion for &apos;Warcraft&apos; is undeniable and we know that he will create an incredible film worthy of Blizzard&apos;s phenomenal franchise. We look forward to collaborating with our partners at Warner Bros. and continuing our successful relationship with Chuck in bringing this rich new world to the screen.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Blizzard Entertainment and Legendary Pictures have a shared vision for this film and we searched at length to find the very best director to bring that vision to life,&quot; said Paul Sams, chief operating officer of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;From our first conversation with Sam, we could tell he was the perfect choice. Sam knows how to simultaneously satisfy the enthusiasts and the mainstream audience that might be experiencing that content for the first time. We&apos;re looking forward to working with him to achieve that here.&quot;<br>

Class Q&amp;A Series: Warrior (Part 2)<br>
Aside from some of the other questions that we have been able to answer throughout this thread, we have also gotten additional feedback on what we have observed as being very pressing issues to the Warrior community. Those questions and their answers can be found below.<br>
<br>
Follow up Question:<br>
<br>
Community Team: Some players feel that, while tanking, having to continually hit Heroic Strike to match your weapon&#x2019;s swing can become somewhat tedious.<br>
<br>
Q: Do we currently have any plans to change Heroic Strike to make it no longer necessary to hit that button on every weapon swing?<br>
<br>
A: Yes, we really don&#x2019;t like way Heroic Strike works. On-next-swing attacks just don&#x2019;t feel right and for tanks especially you can convert every white attack into a Heroic Strike. Unfortunately, they do the job, which is why we haven&#x2019;t changed it yet. It&#x2019;s job is to let warriors bleed off excess rage by converting it to damage and / or threat. It&#x2019;s possible to fix this in other ways, such as perhaps the hit consuming more rage the more you have Execute-style.<br>
<br>
Community Team: It appears that many players who enjoy the Warrior class for its damage aspects continue to feel that, without best in-slot items, their class&#x2019;s performance is very truncated.<br>
<br>
Q: Is this an issue that we have seen in the Warrior class? If so, do we have any plans to accommodate those players who do not have best in-slot items, while still keeping those with the very best equipment from being too powerful?<br>
<br>
A: This really just gets back to the way rage works, which is that damage leads to rage so you have to pick a point at which you balance warriors. High damage and high rage? Low damage and low rage? The way to fix it is to normalize rage even more so that you always get X rage per second regardless of gear. But once you always get X rage per second you essentially just have rogue energy. So, as with the previous question, we don&#x2019;t like the way it is working and want to change it but we don&#x2019;t have a perfect substitute in the can just yet.</div></div>
