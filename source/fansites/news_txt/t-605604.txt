I think it's not a big surprise if I say that the 2.4 Patch introduced a lot of new item models in the game, most of them aren't used more than once but there is actually tons of different skins available for all the weapons added in each patch. Patch 2.4 items aren't an exception and Blizzard added a few color variations for each weapons added to the game, you probably won't see most of them in game, recolors are mostly here for :
New items using old models Arena weapons, or just loot from future dungeons/encounters 
Weapons used by NPCs and recolored to fit their style. 
Nothing, 90% of the recolors are here "just in case", you'll never see them in game but they still look nice. 



Thanks a lot to endarion for all his work on the screenshots.

Darkmoon faire hotfix
There was a "bug" with the Darkmoon Faire this month and it spawned one week early. According to the calendar on the official site, it should have been this week but it seems that 
I apologize greatly for the miscommunication between my team and the web team who maintains the event calendar. The March Darkmoon Faire was listed a week later than it actually occurred.
However, after a very long talk http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5103878682&postId=52356034524&sid=1#0 on the official forums, Blizzard decided to hotfix it and the Darkmoon faire will be active for one more week, starting after the next maintenance.
A hotfix has been applied that will start Darkmoon Faire after the next realm restart or maintenance, which are currently scheduled to conclude at 11:00 AM PDT, March 11.

This will resolve the issue with the Faire running one week earlier than expected and will match the dates of the Faire to those listed on the event calender.


Uldum
It's been a while since the last time we heard anything about Uldum, but Drysc decided to post a little something about it. 
No, it's definitely a dungeon we're keen on opening at some point. Whether that can actually happen or not, or when, hasn't had any final decisions announced. It's a location rich in Titan lore so it's of course something everyone is excited to see come to fruition.

I find the door still interesting as something has obviously broken out. Was there something meant to be contained within Uldum, to be forgotten, that's escaped? Possibly something we don't even associate with the Titans or their creations. Maybe something we take for granted, I don't know, but I like that idea.


Arena season 4 reminder
A small post to explain once again how sets are going to change with the season 4, Drysc also confirms that the Season 4 won't start anytime soon.
We've only stated that Season 2 is moving to honor, Season 1 is being removed, and Season 3 prices will be lowered. Whether Season 4 or Season 2 prices will change from the Season 1 and Season 3 sets they're replacing has not yet been stated.

One thing that's more certain is that Season 4 isn't going to start for quite a while.


Sunwell Plateau still closed on PTRs
The Sunwell Plateau needs more fixing and is still closed for public testing.
The Sunwell Raid instance on the PTR is still closed for public testing at this time. Check back here for updates on future testing opportunities during this week.


No more changes to socket bonuses in the future
I didn't say we can't change socket bonuses, clearly we have in the past, and when we did it caused problems that required hotfixes. These problems may not have affected you personally but they did affect many players. We will not be making changes to socket bonuses in the future to avoid these problems. That is the end of discussion on this topic.


Tabards/Robes bugs
Sometimes wearing a tabard over a robe will only show the top half of the tabard, it's a known issue but sadly it can't really be fixed and you'll have to live with it.
t's been a while since this was asked of the designers/artists but if I remember correctly the reasoning given at the time was that it was not a bug or oversight, but a decision based on technical limitations. The way our armor and animation systems work, of which I will not pretend I have any knowledge of, would make it extremely difficult and labor intensive to have the tabards show properly over the robes and actually look right/good. Something like having to change the entire system as well as remodel every piece or robe armor or some-such, I can't recall the details. So anyway, the decision was made to just hide the bottom portion.
