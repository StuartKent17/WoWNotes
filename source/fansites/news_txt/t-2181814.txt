Patch 7.2 - The Great Akazamzarak
New Order Hall champions are coming in Patch 7.2 and today we are taking a look at The Great Akazamzarak http://ptr.wowdb.com/garrison/followers/995-the-great-akazamzarak. 

If you aren't a fan of his speech in Dalaran, in Patch 7.2 you can ask him to stop!

Throw Down in Dalaran This Friday!
In this week's PTR Development Notes, we mentioned that we were planning to stress test some new server technology we're rolling out in Patch 7.2. Initially, our plan was to have everyone fight Withered J'im, but we wanted to come up with something a little more exciting to make it more fun to participate in.

So, this Friday March 10th, we'll be turning Dalaran into a free-for-all PvP zone on the 7.2 PTR. You'll be able to attack anyone and anything you want - both players and NPCs alike. Oh, and you'll have the same buff mechanic used in the Black Rook Rumble world quest: every time you kill a player, you'll get a stacking increase to your health and damage but reduced healing taken.

We're expecting this to be absolute mayhem... which is great, because we need to put our servers through the ringer! And since events like this are the sort of thing we can only do on the PTR, we're really hoping to have as many players participating as possible.

This event will run from 3 PM to 5 PM Pacific time on Friday. If you'd like to join us, please make sure you have the PTR downloaded and your character copied over ahead of time - while we want to stress test as much as possible, the PTR character copy system is likely to break in the process, so make sure you have a character ready to go!


Recent Action Against Real-Money Raid Clears
As some players have pointed out, we were indeed very conservative with this initial round of actions, and only issued penalties to a handful of the most egregious offenders who had blatantly and openly violated our terms of service. These are meant to serve as a warning to all players who participate in such activities, as we intend for future actions to be much more comprehensive, and the punishments more severe.


Raid Testing Schedule - March 9-10
On Thursday and Friday, March 9-10, we will be conducting raid testing of Tomb of Sargeras bosses.

Thursday, March 9

Demonic Inquisition - Heroic Tomb of Sargeras
13:00 PST 16:00 EST, 22:00 CET

Fallen Avatar - Heroic Tomb of Sargeras
14:00 PST 17:00 EST, 23:00 CET

Friday, March 10

The Desolate Host - Mythic Tomb of Sargeras
13:00 PST 16:00 EST, 22:00 CET

Harjatan - Mythic Tomb of Sargeras
14:00 PST 17:00 EST, 23:00 CET

After testing concludes on Friday, we plan to open Raid Finder Tomb of Sargeras over the weekend.

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.


Patch 7.2 - Druid Class Mount Changes
Note that today's build was made while we were in the middle of making these changes, so it's in somewhat of an incomplete state. In the next build, here's how it'll function:

- Completing the questline unlocks the form for all Druids on your account, but only enables it for that character.
- Once unlocked, you can enable/disable it at will by talking to an NPC that's in the Dreamgrove if you've completed the questline and in Moonglade always, for the alts.
- When enabled, Travel Form will use the form of a Lunarwing Owl instead of a Storm Crow, and it will be rideable by party members. You won't need any additional keybindings or macros.
- Glyph of the Sentinel takes priority over Lunarwing Form being enabled. If you have that glyph applied, you'll appear as a Sentinel.

Hope that helps clarify what to expect!
