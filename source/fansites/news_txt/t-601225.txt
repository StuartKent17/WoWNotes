Boubouille2007-04-25, 02:00 AMOk, it's not really useful to keep the 2.1.0 post on top of the homepage now, I'll keep it linked on the top of the menu. This also means we're back to the old news system and you can all start using the RSS Feed http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?type=rss;action=.xml;board=2.0;sa=news; again to get the latest news. 

We'll start with a first look at Illidan, brought to you by a sneaky warlock of Ropetown http://www.ropetown.com.
