Beta Realm Maintenance - 8/11/14
It looks like we may get a new beta build today!
Greetings All!

The Beta realms will be coming down for maintenance tonight order to deploy a new build. I'll be updating this thread with information and time estimates as I receive them. I don't have an ETA at this time, but I will update this post if I receive one.

I'll be leaving this thread open for general discussion as long as people remain civil and follow forum rules.
