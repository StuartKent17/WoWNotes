Updated PTR Schedule - 31/03<br>
Here&apos;s the current schedule for Ulduar PTR testing:<br>
<br>
On the North American test realms:<br>
[b]Hodir (Hard Mode) - Tuesday Night, March 31, starting at 7pm EDT/4pm PDT.<br>
We&apos;ve made some adjustments to the NPC mechanics in an effort to better balance the ability for melee and ranged players to do damage.<br>
<br>
Iron Council (Hard Mode) - Wednesday Night, April 1, starting at 7pm EDT/4pm PDT.<br>
We&apos;d like Steelbreaker last tested again, we have Static Disruption working again.<br>
<br>
On the European test realms:<br>
General Vezax (Hard Mode) - Wednesday Night, April 1 at 19:00 CET.<br>
We&apos;ve made further adjustments to try and balance the the effectiveness of ranged DPS casters and melee in the fight.<br>
<br>
For Hard Mode testing, Shirts of Uber will be available on Ursula McWeaksauce to help simulate a raid having obtained Ulduar gear. Check the entrance area of Ulduar for the vendor.<br>
<br>
This schedule could change at a moment&apos;s notice due to server, bug, or patch status. I&apos;ll try to keep everyone informed as much as possible. Ulduar and the bosses to be tested will remain also open a variable length of time. How long they stay open depends upon a host of factors including designer availability, bug status, etc.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re very interested in seeing combat logs and parses for all raid testing on the PTR.</div></div>
