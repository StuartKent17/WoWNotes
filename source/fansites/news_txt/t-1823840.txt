Arms Nerf Justification
Prior to the nerf earlier this week, Arms was outperforming most specs by a considerable margin on virtually every fight in Hellfire Citadel. Our intent with the reduction of the 4-piece bonus this week wasn't to drastically reduce the viability of Arms Warriors, but rather to tone their DPS down just a bit and bring them more in-line with other damage dealers, while also fixing a bug that exacerbated the issue. 

The nerf has only been in effect for a little over 24 hours, but so far Arms still seems to be doing very well. We'll continue to monitor how this change -- along with the changes we made to other DPS specs this week -- play out in Hellfire Citadel. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

The only reason I play Horde PVP in WoD is for the faster ques, same reason I played Alliance in MoP. Dont take my fast ques away.
Why do you think it will make your queues longer? holinka 
Competition for spots, beforehand the horde would go straight in the spot, now loads of ally are contending for it
It is based on queue times. Currently, it would only be available when there are a lot of Alliance waiting. holinka 
If it ever got to the point where the other faction was waiting too, it would turn off. holinka 

If mercenary system get approved from the community on unranked pvp is there any chance to bring it to ranked arenas/rbgs? 
The intent of Mercenary mode is to fix long queue times caused by faction populations. Doesn't apply to Ranked PvP. holinka 

Why merc mode over, say, this: 
A number of reasons. First, assuming the proposal as a non-optional thing: Sometimes Alliance just end up on Horde side. holinka 
It is very jarring to suddenly be on the opposite side in starting area themed around the other faction. holinka 
Second, it doesn't benefit the less represented faction in any way. Merc allows savvy players to switch sides to help. holinka 
Third, we want to preserve the faction conflict in our unrated battlegrounds. holinka 

In Mercenary Mode mode will players who are placed on opposite side wear the mask or is that a blog element only?
The NPCs have masks. holinka 

Misc
It's just funny, Darkmoon firewater stacking, hotfixed in 2 days. PvP gear hotfixed in two months. Fun nerf > PvP
Bugs and design changes are not created equal. WarcraftDevs 

Mount size nerf, undocumented in 6.2 notes. Can I get clarification on this please?
The change in 6.2 was too severe. We're currently discussing how to find a happy medium. We don't hate fun. WarcraftDevs
