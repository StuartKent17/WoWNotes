Hellfire High Council

Fixed a situation where Mark of the Necromancer http://www.wowdb.com/spells/184676-mark-of-the-necromancer could stop dealing damage to players.


PvP
Ashran

Winning events in Ashran should now always award a Dented Ashmaul Strongbox http://www.wowdb.com/items/128214-dented-ashmaul-strongbox#related:contains-item.


Items

Etheralus, the Eternal Reward http://www.wowdb.com/items/124638-etheralus-the-eternal-reward absorption effect should now correctly factor in Multistrikes from Healing Stream Totem and Healing Tide Totem. Additionally, healing dealt by Spirit Link's health redistribution no longer counts towards the absorption effect.

Prophecy of Fear http://www.wowdb.com/items/124230-prophecy-of-fear Doom Nova effect should no longer be incorrectly triggered by Sunfall.

Fixed an issue where Venom Rush http://www.wowdb.com/spells/152152-venom-rush could incorrectly persist indefinitely.



Paragon - Mythic Mannoroth Kill Video
We looked at Method's Mythic Mannoroth video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ACk8B-ZMhw recently, so today we are taking a look at Paragon's video while we wait for more guilds to clear Mythic Hellfire Citadel.

Arms Nerf Justification
Prior to the nerf earlier this week, Arms was outperforming most specs by a considerable margin on virtually every fight in Hellfire Citadel. Our intent with the reduction of the 4-piece bonus this week wasn't to drastically reduce the viability of Arms Warriors, but rather to tone their DPS down just a bit and bring them more in-line with other damage dealers, while also fixing a bug that exacerbated the issue. 

The nerf has only been in effect for a little over 24 hours, but so far Arms still seems to be doing very well. We'll continue to monitor how this change -- along with the changes we made to other DPS specs this week -- play out in Hellfire Citadel.

The only reason I play Horde PVP in WoD is for the faster ques, same reason I played Alliance in MoP. Dont take my fast ques away.
Why do you think it will make your queues longer? holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621476125697376256
Competition for spots, beforehand the horde would go straight in the spot, now loads of ally are contending for it
It is based on queue times. Currently, it would only be available when there are a lot of Alliance waiting. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621478118356750336
If it ever got to the point where the other faction was waiting too, it would turn off. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621478204360921088

If mercenary system get approved from the community on unranked pvp is there any chance to bring it to ranked arenas/rbgs? 
The intent of Mercenary mode is to fix long queue times caused by faction populations. Doesn't apply to Ranked PvP. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621480718481252352

Why merc mode over, say, this: http://t.co/489d3Sxca7
A number of reasons. First, assuming the proposal as a non-optional thing: Sometimes Alliance just end up on Horde side. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621532630467526656
It is very jarring to suddenly be on the opposite side in starting area themed around the other faction. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621533017249460224
Second, it doesn't benefit the less represented faction in any way. Merc allows savvy players to switch sides to help. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621533392765476865
Third, we want to preserve the faction conflict in our unrated battlegrounds. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621534412509843456

In Mercenary Mode mode will players who are placed on opposite side wear the mask or is that a blog element only?
The NPCs have masks. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621534578168061953

Misc
It's just funny, Darkmoon firewater stacking, hotfixed in 2 days. PvP gear hotfixed in two months. Fun nerf > PvP
Bugs and design changes are not created equal. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/621798605070819328

Mount size nerf, undocumented in 6.2 notes. Can I get clarification on this please?
The change in 6.2 was too severe. We're currently discussing how to find a happy medium. We don't hate fun. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/621814186495078401
