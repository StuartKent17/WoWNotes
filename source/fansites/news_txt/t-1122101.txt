I want to be the very best!
Picking up Pet Battle Training on the beta is pretty easy, all you need to do is visit the trainer in your capital city and pick up the 2 abilities.

Update - Almost forgot about those, added something about the Pet Battle Masters. 

Tracking Pets
The pet tracking changed slightly since our first preview, you now track 2 types of pets: the ones that you can't capture and are only here to let you gain XPs will show up as a small yellow dot on your map. The ones you can actually capture will show up with an easily noticeable green icon and will be flagged as capturable in their tooltip.

Fight!
The fight is started by right clicking a pet creature when you're in range approximately 30 yards. The camera will rotate around your character and the game will switch to Pet Battle mode. From this screen you can:


See the status of all your pets at the top left of your screen.
Control the abilities of your active pet at the bottom.
Switch between pets and see them by clicking the 4th icon on the bar. 
Capture pets when they're low on life! 
You can also surrender but that sounds pretty wimpy to be honest. 

The battle is pretty simple, weaknesses and strengths are already implemented and if you pick the wrong type of pet you will get your ass kicked pretty fast. It ends whenever the enemy is defeated or captured.

Finding New Pets
How are you going to know where to find new pets for your collection? Easy, Blizzard is going to integrate a full encyclopedia directly in the game. Maps aren't implemented yet but currently, the info page of any pet will already tell you where you can find it!
