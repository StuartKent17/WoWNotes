Potential New Book - Troll Wars
A listing appeared on the French version of Amazon https://www.amazon.fr/World-Warcraft-Trollkriege-Paul-Kemp/dp/3833235373/ for "World of Warcraft: Die Trollkriege https://www.amazon.fr/World-Warcraft-Trollkriege-Paul-Kemp/dp/3833235373/" by Paul Kemp. Keep in mind that this is not an official announcement. 

Following the legendary War of the Ancients, a group of Night Elven magi were banished from their homeland. They looked for new land to settle on the coast of Lordaeron. At this time, the area was already settled by several loosely-allied weak tribes, while the Troll race had an advanced civilization. The arrival of the foreign Magi and their alliance with the Human race lay the foundation to one of the most serious conflicts Azeroth had ever witnessed, a conflict that would be known throughout history as the Troll Wars http://wow.gamepedia.com/Troll_Wars.
