Let&apos;s confirm this, yes, Patch 4.0.3a will be deployed on live servers this week and will change the world of Azeroth forever. You only have a few hours left to say good bye to the old world (and farm try to get that stupid mount in Zul&apos;gurub) before Deathwing decides that it needs a new look. All the information and the official patch notes are available below. <br>
<br>
Get ready for the biggest change you ever witnessed in World of Warcraft, and enjoy! <br>
<br>
<br>
What&apos;s in Patch 4.0.3a<br>
Sammew posted an interesting list of the features you should and should not expect in Patch 4.0.3a on the official forums (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/134406/403a-what-is-in-it-what-is-not). Zarhym also jumped in, and announced a 20% reduction to the XP required to gain levels from 71 to 80. <br>

<br>
<br>
What is in:<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Beta Build 13066 - Portals removed from Shattrath and Dalaran<br>
Blizzard doesn&apos;t want you to use Shattrath and Dalaran as portal hubs anymore, the latest beta update removed all the portal to the cities and replaced them with class trainers. <br>

<br>
Cataclysm / Patch 4.0.3a - The Shattering<br>
I went through all the old zones pages and updated all of them with screenshots from the latest build of the beta (if you&apos;re wondering, that&apos;s a little more than 1400 screenshots). All these zones will be changed when Patch 4.0.3a is deployed on live servers this week. I also included links to Wowpedia (http://www.wowpedia.org/) for people who are looking for a few extra lore informations, etc ...<br>
<br>
With the expansion getting closer, expect a lot of similar updates to Cataclysm articles in the next few days. <br>

Mounts and Items Removed in 4.0.3<br>
As stated in the Under Dev page (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/), patch 4.0.3 brings about The Shattering, a cataclysmic event that will forever change the face of Azeroth. As we prepare to raise the level cap and introduce two new races with the Cataclysm expansion, it&apos;s important to keep in mind that the game world is going through tremendous changes that will affect the availability of certain rare mounts and items.<br>
<br>
Swift Zulian Tiger<br>
Zul&apos;Gurub is changing from a raid to a leveling zone in 4.0.3, and this mount will no longer be obtainable.<br>
<br>
Swift Razzashi Raptor<br>
This mount will also no longer be obtainable after the change to Zul&apos;Gurub.<br>
<br>
Razzashi Hatchling<br>
With the change to Zul&apos;Gurub this non-combat pet will no longer be obtainable. (Update - The Razzashi Hatchling is [b]still obtainable in Patch 4.0.3a (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/129029/is-the-razzashi-hatchling-item-to-be-removed))<br>
<br>
Tome of Polymorph: Turtle http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage<br>
This tome will continue to be available through other means.<br>
<br>
Crusader&apos;s White/Black Warhorse and Swift Alliance Steed/Swift Horde Wolf<br>
As the attempt-based tribute system is being removed from Heroic Trial of the Crusader, the Argent Crusade Tribute Chest will no longer spawn, and these mounts will no longer be obtainable<br>
<br>
Reins of the Blue Drake<br>
This mount will once again be available from defeating 10-player Malygos without needing to use the Dungeon Finder. The Reins of the Azure Drake will only be available on 25-player Malygos.<br>
<br>
Mimiron&apos;s Head<br>
This mount will change to be a very low drop chance when defeating 25-player Yogg&apos;Saron with no Keepers assisting you<br>
<br>
Invincible<br>
This mount will change to be a very low drop chance when defeating Heroic 25-player Lich King<br>
<br>
Although we have no current plans to introduce new ways to obtain the Zul&apos;Gurub mounts, pets, and the tribute mounts, they may return should we find a place where they fit in the future. <br>

The Shattering of Azeroth<br>
In the frigid wastes of Northrend, the final battle against the merciless Lich King ended in victory for Azeroth&apos;s defenders. Upon returning home, veterans of the unforgiving conflict against the Scourge were showered with praise for their valiant sacrifices, while the honorable dead were mourned. Yet as hope flared anew in the wake of the Lich King&apos;s fall, Azeroth&apos;s native elemental spirits grew confused and erratic, setting off a series of deadly natural disasters. Horde and Alliance leaders scrambled for clues about the troubling state of the world, but nothing could have prepared them for what was to come.<br>
<br>
Without warning, the corrupted Dragon Aspect, Deathwing, erupted from the stone heart of Deepholm, the domain of earth within the Elemental Plane. Jagged fissures were torn across the earth, and monstrous waves pummeled coastal regions. From Thousand Needles to the Blasted Lands, the surface of Azeroth was reforged through violent upheavals. Now, the Horde and the Alliance must defend their homes against Deathwing and his minions, burdened by the unsettling fact that the world as they know it has changed... forever.<br>
<br>
Azeroth Shattered<br>
<br>
Deathwing&apos;s return has had an immeasurable impact throughout the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor. Players will notice drastically altered terrain, thousands of new quests from levels 1-55, and updated level ranges for some zones to improve the questing flow.<br>
<br>
<br>
New Race/Class Combinations<br>
<br>
In the wake of a world on the brink of destruction, members of the Horde and Alliance have taken to new cultures and studies, mastering crafts previously foreign to them. Many existing playable races now have new class combinations. Check the official World of Warcraft: Cataclysm website for a breakdown of the new combinations.<br>
<br>
<br>
General<br>
<br>
The World of Warcraft: Cataclysm cinematic trailer and login screen have been added to the game.<br>
Experience required to gain levels 71 through 80 has been reduced by 20%, which increases leveling rate by 25%.<br>
<br>
<br>
Classes: General<br>
<br>
Due to several talent revisions for select classes, druids, paladins, priests, and shaman have had their talent trees reset.<br>
The damage and healing done by players from levels 1-79 has been retuned, with the base points of almost all spells and abilities reduced. This was done to bring combat times at low levels to a more reasonable length. For most abilities that deal weapon damage, the weapon damage percent now rises per level until level 80, and starts at a lower percent.<br>
Healing Rain, Efflorescence, Holy Radiance, Holy Word: Sanctuary now have a diminished effect when healing more than 6 players at once.<br>
Mortal Strike, Furious Attacks, Wound Poison, Widow Venom, Permafrost, Improved Mind Blast, Monstrous Bite, and Legion Strike now reduce healing by 10%, down from 25%.<br>
Effects which are broken from taking too much damage (Fear, Frost Nova, Entangling Roots, etc.) now break automatically from about half as much damage taken as before.<br>

Swift Rejuvenation is now a 1-point talent, down from 2. The global cooldown reduction this talent provides to Rejuvenation remains 0.5 seconds.<br>
Symbiosis: heal-over-time spells (Rejuvenation, Regrowth, Lifebloom) can no longer benefit from this Mastery merely by refreshing themselves. A different heal-over-time spell must be present.<br>
<br>
<br>
Glyphs<br>
<br>
Glyph of Healing Touch now reduces the cooldown on Nature&apos;s Swiftness by 10 seconds after using Healing Touch, up from 5 seconds.<br>
