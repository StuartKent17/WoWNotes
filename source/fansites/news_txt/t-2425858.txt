Complete the War Campaign in Kul Tiras and Zandalar and earn the Achievement Ready for War earnable on both Horde and Alliance.


Two paths lay before you. Which will you take?

Expulsom Sources
I am trying to level jewelcrafting but it requires 2 expulsom to craft a single gem. It is a long way to 150 when expulsum is, seemingly, so rare. How do you guys manage to gather larger amounts of this stuff? I've scrapped a ton of gear with only a few expulsom as a result.
Personally I've managed to obtain, most of the Expulsom from scrapping gear, especially trinkets, that I would not use or were a downgrade for my character. If you see a world quest that offers a trinket, go for it, as it may offer you an Expulsom material - that excludes crafted trinkets. You can also manufacture it if you have the Alchemy profession. So maybe level that profession up, along with your Jewelcrafting?
