New Allied Races Ready to Recruit
Have you unlocked Dark Iron Dwarves  or Mag'har Orcs 


<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src=""></script><noscript><a href="">Are you working on unlocking the new Allied Races?</a></noscript>

With the war between the Horde and the Alliance in full swing, you’ll need every ally you can get to help ensure victory for your faction. The journey to bring two new Allied Races—Mag’har orcs  and Dark Iron dwarves —into the fold has begun in Kul Tiras and Zandalar.

You can earn the loyalty of these two Allied Races and add their might to your faction by meeting the following requirements:


Reach level 120
Become Exalted with the key subfaction from your side’s War Campaign:

Alliance: 7th Legion
Horde: The Honorbound


Complete the War Campaign in Kul Tiras and Zandalar and earn the Achievement Ready for War earnable on both Horde and Alliance.


Two paths lay before you. Which will you take?

Expulsom Sources
I am trying to level jewelcrafting but it requires 2 expulsom to craft a single gem. It is a long way to 150 when expulsum is, seemingly, so rare. How do you guys manage to gather larger amounts of this stuff? I've scrapped a ton of gear with only a few expulsom as a result.
Personally I've managed to obtain, most of the Expulsom from scrapping gear, especially trinkets, that I would not use or were a downgrade for my character. If you see a world quest that offers a trinket, go for it, as it may offer you an Expulsom material - that excludes crafted trinkets. You can also manufacture it if you have the Alchemy profession. So maybe level that profession up, along with your Jewelcrafting? Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
