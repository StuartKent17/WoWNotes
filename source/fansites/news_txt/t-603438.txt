Boubouille2007-11-25, 08:19 AMFeast of Winter Veil : New gift ?
The Feast of Winter Veil will start soon in 2 weeks and 6 days actually and it didn't look like we could expect something new. Wrong ! If you read carefully the 2.3.2 patch notes you will notice this line :
Clockwork Rocket Bots will no longer attack each other in Shattrath City.
Good news, the item is now linkable on PTRs and the ItemID is right after a new [Winter Veil Gift] item Basically, it means that they probably were added at the same time during the development process. The following is pure speculation but we can assume they're both additions to the Winter Veil Feast rewards, and we can go further by supposing that these bots will use the new Holidayrobot model introduced in the 2.3 patch. Keep in mind that nothing is confirmed yet.

Update : It seems that this item on the US PvE server, the only one I never join, obviously. New screenshot added, at least it means that I'm still good at speculating. even when it's useless

Thottbot / WoWHead new scripts
While we're talking about useful things, both Thottbot http://thottbot.com/x/power and Wowhead http://www.wowhead.com/?forums&topic=3464&p=35822 released new scripts that let you link any item without installing anything on your site. 

Thottbot
<script src="http://i.thottbot.com/power.js"></script>
<a href="http&#58;//thottbot.com/i30987">Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker</a>

Wowhead
<script src="http://www.wowhead.com/widgets/power.js"></script>
<a class="q5" href="http&#58;//www.wowhead.com/?item=19019">Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker</a>

In both case, you will get the tooltip of the item you want, the script from wowhead comes with an additional "class" features that let you color item links 0 = Gray, 1 = White, 2 = Green, 3 = Rare, 4 = Epic, 5 = Legendary. You can also add it easily to thottbot links just by setting a font color on your link.

Both sites are currently developping this feature and we'll probably see more cool things from it soon. Thottbot already let you set up your own tooltip and add a search box to your page. Feel free to read the dedicated page on Thottbot http://thottbot.com/x/power and Wowhead http://www.wowhead.com/?forums&topic=3464&p=35822 to see what's best for you.
