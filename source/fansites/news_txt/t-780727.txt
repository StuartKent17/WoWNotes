Ex-WoWWiki Admins Join Curse to Create Wowpedia
You probably saw a couple of forum posts about it, most of the team behind WoWWiki left the website and created a new site: Wowpedia.org  On a personal level, I'm glad that the team decided to pick Curse for this new project and I'm sure we have a great opportunity to build something really nice with that new site. 

From Curse.com 
We're extremely excited to announce that the administrators and contributors previously from WoWWiki have now joined the Curse family of websites and have created a new wiki for World of Warcraft !, Wowpedia.org 

This free-to-use, community-driven wiki is the latest in our efforts to provide World of Warcraft players with premiere content and resources to help make your experiences better both in and out of the game.

Wowpedia is already booming, but it will need the help of the community to continue to thrive. Head over and make it the best wiki for World of Warcraft !

A few of the stats for Wowpedia, so far:



More than 218,000 pages have been created, with over 84,000 content pages
Over 72,000 users have registered to contribute to the wiki and its community
15 administrators , all focused on building the premiere information resource for World of Warcraft
330,000 visits since Wowpedia went live last week


We're also pleased to announce that for the next two months, Wowpedia will operate completely ad-free. And while we'll need to have advertising on the website eventually to cover hosting fees, those ads will never be obtrusive or affect the flow of content on a page.

As always, it's our goal here at Curse to provide gamers with the best possible tools, and the Wowpedia team is a great addition to the family.

Cho'gall 25 Multi-PoV and Nefarian/Onyxia Sneak Peek Videos
Paragon  released another video of Cho'gall 25, this one has multiple point of views and might give you a few more details on the fight! Also, the french guild Millenium  managed to activate the first part of the Onyxia/Nefarian encounter in Blackwing Descent. Currently, you cannot finish the fight and Onyxia will be stuck at 1 HP.

The Sunken Temple in Cataclysm
If you watched/attended Blizzcon you probably heard that the size of the Sunken Temple/Temple of Atal'hakkar is greatly reduced now that the top portion of the instance is gone. Basically the only thing left is a quest NPC at the entrance, some trash, and 4 easily accessable bosses, more than enough to make your rerolls very happy to run the instance!

"Insane in the Membrane" in Cataclysm
Insane in the Membrane is a feat of strength, not an achievement. Feats are things that you can't be guaranteed to complete, which is why they're feats and not achievements. Most of them are actually now impossible to complete, and this feat will join a long list of "you had to be there" moments in WoW time.

The feat isn't being removed of course, those who have it will retain it, however; some of the requirements are, so it will no longer be able to be completed by anyone who has not already done so.

It's possible that in some very specific situations where someone has completed the reputations which are being removed, but not others that will still be in the game, that it can still be completed. But it's something we're waiting for clarity on, and will let you know as soon as we do. Source
