Boubouille2007-03-21, 02:26 AMThe kill of the final boss of Serpentshrine Cavern, Lady Vashj, seems to be very near. Today Nihilum  reached 25% health on her. 
If the hotfix made it easier, can we expect a kill soon from Death and Taxes if they manage to clean the whole instance after their downtime ? Stay tuned, i'm sure we'll hear about a world first kill soon.

Update : This isn't officially confirmed but it seems that Lady Vashj's adds have been nerfed from 340 000 HP to 145 000. The hotfix is already applied to EU servers.
