Warlords of Draenor Theorycraft Discussion
Another question I've seen asked...

Baseline healer mana regen with no Spirit
0.8%/sec for level 1-90.
Drops by 0.04%/sec per level past 90.
0.4%/sec at level 100.

Is the radius of lava lash's flame shock spread centered on the shaman or on the target that's being lava lashed with flame shock on it?
Centered on the target that's being Lava Lashed.

Could you elaborate on this?

-Say I have 0 stacks of SoB, and am about to begin AoEing. My main target has BP/FF at 20s, while another nearby target has them at 28 seconds. Pestilence, in this case, will take the 28 second DoTs and apply them to everything?
Still a bit murky about how 0 stack SoB works with NP, since on Alpha it starts by spreading at 1 stack/30s and then adds stacks after- is this all intended?

-Now say I have 2 stacks of SoB- instead of looking for a target with longer diseases, Pestilence will automatically refresh BP/FF on all nearby targets or spread them at full duration. In addition, it will add one stack to existing Necrotic Plague infections OR spread 1 stack/30 second Necrotic Plague to any targets without the disease.

I was referring to Scent of Blood, the passive, not the stacks. The SoB passive is what says the "your Pestilence refreshes your diseases" effect.

Vereesa Verestrasz has noticed that Pestilence for Unholy/Frost DKs seems to be spreading diseases at current durations instead of spreading them at new durations- is this intended, or a bug? If it's intended, could you elaborate on Pestilence's functionality for both DPS specs- assuming BP/FF and Necrotic Plague?

Also, will Pestilence behave better with big boss models and adds from now on? Thinking ones like Ragnaros, Al'Akir and Immerseus here.
Yes, intended. That's why I said it *clones* the diseases to the other targets.

Pestilence hits all units who have any part of their hit box within 10yd of you.

Related to your multistrike conversation with Collision, Shining Protector is also acting in an anomalous way. It's not really a theorycrafting issue though, so no point in discussing the details here. Bug thread thisaway: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13183868324

Yep, Shining Protector was bugged, still using the old 2x X/2% style. Fixed, for the build after next.

Does the cloned dot include the current ongoing time-to-tick on the new target?
Yup.

What is the spirit regen formula/scaling at level 100?
It's 0.412207024 Mana per second, per Spirit.

What's the mana regen rate of arcane mages now that the 90 tier is decoupled from mana?
1+Haste*1.8% of base max mana per second.
EDIT: Fixed. Originally said 0.4%, but forgot that Mages have a hidden passive which gives them 4.5x.

Can multistrike melee hits proc "on melee hit" procs like killing machine and sudden doom?
No. Multistrikes cannot proc other things, unless those other things specifically call out that they proc from Multistrikes.

How will Blood in the Water feral execute, rip refresh on FB work with the panedmic mechanic. Will it grant a longer 130% duration Rip, or will it always reset to the base duration like it does now?
Fixed Blood in the Water and Touch of Chaos to be able to refresh up to 1.3x base duration. That'll be in the build after next.

Reminder for anyone working on Recount, Skada, etc... Filter out damage done to Prismatic Crystal. The Mage will cast an additional spell that does damage to enemies based on damage they deal to Prismatic Crystal, so if you include both, you'll be double-counting them.

Please confirm this. My current level 92 fire mage on alpha has 1.8% mana per second, which is almost an order of magnitude higher. My template 90 arcane mage also has much higher mana regen than this quoted number.

EDIT: 3330 combat regen mp5 according to tooltip on naked template 90 orc arcane mage. Mana pool is 37000, which gives 1.8% mana per second. Is the quoted mana regen implemented yet?

EDIT2: Fix numbers and here's a screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/Gz5oH0C.jpg
3330 mp5 over 37000 mana pool, 3330/5 = 666, 666/37000 = 1.8%. This does not agree with quoted 0.4% figure.
Whoops. There's a passive that gives them 4.5x Mana regen, but I forgot that it's hidden, you don't see it. Yes, it's 1.8%, not 0.4%. Fixed the post above.

Thanks. Does this mana regen rate decay from level 90 to 100?
It does not.

#2 and #3 are currently not working. Sweeping strikes never multistrike, and multistrikes are not added to the ignite.
Yep, I fixed those late last week; check next build.

What is the mechanical philosophy behind Eminence and Atonement?
It varies. All stats benefit healing, but it's alright if only some stats benefit Atonement/Eminence, or only competitively benefit Atonement/Eminence. But lets keep this thread about theorycrafting, and leave the "why" and philosophy for other threads. Feel free to state what the values of each stat are based on theorycraft are to Atonement/Eminence though here, that's good data.

noticed that if Blood Craze is procced on consecutive autoattacks, it seems to become an ignite? It looked like it was adding the leftover dot into the next 3 ticks. Does that sound right?
Yep.

I noticed Resolve isn't meant to affect life% heals,but it affects Empowered Seals-->Insightwhich is op anyway at 5%hp/2 secs
Resolve will actually affect % heals, in most cases. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476271279448662016
Ok, the thread just said Resolve does not affect percent-based heals i.e. "heals you for 20% of your life" would be unaffected
Oh, it does say that. I wrote that a bit ago; we're still discussing, and think it's worth trying if it does work on % heals. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476284789037621248

Why do tanks need vengeance/resolve? Can't you just get rid of it?
It's so % reduction abilities ie Shield Block and flat reduction abilities ie Shield Barrier stay competitive with each other. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476298667800801280
From a healer point of view, it makes them NPC that don't require much attention unless they have no idea what they're doing :/
That's not Resolve; that's the overall defensive power of tanks, which was too strong in Mists, and is coming way down in Warlords. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476307689643835394

Still 2.5% chance to proc? Seems farily low compared to 30% chance on crit live version.
No, 5%. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476307292195782656

is there a way to recalculate, so that mastery procs doesnt count? it would be a shame if snapshot going away bc this
Yeah, we're working on a change to make it snapshot Balance Energy, and then dynamically turn that into Eclipse per tick Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476327535689490432

Do you have any plans of capping the amount you can extend MF/SF with Balance of Power like the old Starfire glyph?
You can extend it an infinite number of times, but the debuffs can never have a duration longer than 1.3x their normal duration. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476293018312380416

carrion swarm & supernova both could be used as an interrupt, yet the former is something you dont want warlocks to have, why?
Supernova is an alternate of Frost Nova; giving up Frost Nova is a big deal. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476183806316007425

And on the back end of that, why not for arcane either, shouldn't arcane multis gain dmg from mastery and/or arcane charges?
Arcane's multistrikes do benefit from Mastery and Arcane Charges. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476230372359815169

Are frosts frostbolt multistrikes supposed to proc the icicles? If so why do they work for ignite but not frost.
Multistrikes will be create Icicles and Ignites in the build after next. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476230237982707713

Could you explain what the Supernova is supposed to do exactly? The knock-up looks tiny and doesn't seem to serve much purpose.
It may be on the weak side still. It's a short CC, but doesn't break on damage like freezes do, always interrupts, etc. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476248878480498689
Not a bad idea though its going to need a pretty sizable shot in the arm to be useful. Thanks for the reply.

Ah, that's not range, that's the low ceiling; it's failing to path to the point in the air it's trying to get to. Will fix that. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476207732261797889
Aye my bad. There's something to fix though, so I guess uploading the clip wasn't so useless after all. Thanks anyway.
No, not useless at all, good testing. Still a bug, just wasn't the cause you thought it was. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476210458727153667

Saw Death from above on yt. Any chance we get a cool anim with it? Right now it's the plain jump anim with pull to trg
It has a unique visual; it's not even remotely the plain jump anim. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476307450191036416

Sudden Death: will it proc from white only going forward, or is there a chance for Multistrike to replace SoO's contribution?
White only, and tuned accordingly. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476191211867226113

Any thought what might replace Anger Management talent for warriors since Readiness isn't going to be put in the game?
It's staying for now, anyway, we'll just list the abilities on its tooltip, instead of saying to reference Readiness. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476327376343683072

Character / Items
will the proc chance of WoD RPPM trinkets scale with haste? Or case by case basis?
General rule is that either the proc rate or the proc benefit scales with haste, not both. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476268967179190273

Warlords of Draenor Stats
I thought the dps pots were still primary stat
Yeah, potions are primaries. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476150700712288256

Also, does multi-strike trigger "on hit" effects, like killing machine proc off white hit or DK T75rune regen tier?
Not unless specifically called out as such. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476222406793515008
is there an example spell that does call out for "on multistrike hit" you can give me? Thanks for the quick replies.
Blood Craze http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/159362-blood-craze is one. Few more in next build. Plans to add some to a few more specs. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476227513870327808

Does that mean 66 ms rating will give two 1% chances to do an additional 30% dmg? And 80 haste rating = 1% haste?
Yes. Versatility undecided yet, but I'd guess somewhere around 130. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476290377154977792

is armor mitigation going to be 75% or 85% in 6.0?
The cap will be 85%. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476425109310169089
so using armor/armor+k_value means we'll see 29650 being the 85% cap?
Armor/Armor+K, but yeah. And it'd be 29660 with rounding. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476439188997300225

PvP
Arent you afraid, that ne new sec. Stats will have a huge Impact in PvP? Even if these Stats are low? If not, why?
That's not a fear, that's an expectation. They most certainly will have an effect on PvP. That's not a bad thing, though. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476432214943473664
Ah ok, you seems to be very relaxed. Why are you bringing these Stats in the Game, if you know, these can be "bad" for PvP?
It's a good thing when we add new content and systems to the game, especially in expansions. It keeps the game from getting stale Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476435092085030912
For sure! But doesent some Speccs sacle more with these stats than other? I think of "bursty" classes, which benefit too much.
We're tuning with these stats in mind. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476441138228764672

World
I bet it's not tuned yet. per post on spell damage tuning.
No, it's tuned and consciously deadlier. Going for a leisurely swim in lava is silly. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/476260449756135424

Misc
GC's Law: In social games, players fear the perception that they are uninformed more than the perception that they play badly.
Sort of an aside, but once I bought a recommended item and my friends busted my balls. That was a bad experience. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/476147848665243648
We will see win rates increase when we change recommended items.
It contributes to the original point that even though the choice was fine, the social element made it feel bad. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/476149243451686912
We see high ban rates for champions with low win rates, we assume because the pros are doing it.
This legit confuses the crap out of me. What makes people think the meta is the same at every skill level?
Back to Greg's original point, the fear of picking the "wrong champ" as defined by "the best" drives behavior holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/476150564128952322
