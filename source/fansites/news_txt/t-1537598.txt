Warlords of Draenor Theorycraft Discussion
Another question I've seen asked...

Baseline healer mana regen with no Spirit
0.8%/sec for level 1-90.
Drops by 0.04%/sec per level past 90.
0.4%/sec at level 100.

Is the radius of lava lash's flame shock spread centered on the shaman or on the target that's being lava lashed with flame shock on it?
Centered on the target that's being Lava Lashed.

Could you elaborate on this?

-Say I have 0 stacks of SoB, and am about to begin AoEing. My main target has BP/FF at 20s, while another nearby target has them at 28 seconds. Pestilence, in this case, will take the 28 second DoTs and apply them to everything?
Still a bit murky about how 0 stack SoB works with NP, since on Alpha it starts by spreading at 1 stack/30s and then adds stacks after- is this all intended?

-Now say I have 2 stacks of SoB- instead of looking for a target with longer diseases, Pestilence will automatically refresh BP/FF on all nearby targets or spread them at full duration. In addition, it will add one stack to existing Necrotic Plague infections OR spread 1 stack/30 second Necrotic Plague to any targets without the disease.

I was referring to Scent of Blood, the passive, not the stacks. The SoB passive is what says the "your Pestilence refreshes your diseases" effect.

Vereesa Verestrasz has noticed that Pestilence for Unholy/Frost DKs seems to be spreading diseases at current durations instead of spreading them at new durations- is this intended, or a bug? If it's intended, could you elaborate on Pestilence's functionality for both DPS specs- assuming BP/FF and Necrotic Plague?

Also, will Pestilence behave better with big boss models and adds from now on? Thinking ones like Ragnaros, Al'Akir and Immerseus here.
Yes, intended. That's why I said it *clones* the diseases to the other targets.

Pestilence hits all units who have any part of their hit box within 10yd of you.

Related to your multistrike conversation with Collision, Shining Protector is also acting in an anomalous way. It's not really a theorycrafting issue though, so no point in discussing the details here. Bug thread thisaway: 

Yep, Shining Protector was bugged, still using the old 2x X/2% style. Fixed, for the build after next.

Does the cloned dot include the current ongoing time-to-tick on the new target?
Yup.

What is the spirit regen formula/scaling at level 100?
It's 0.412207024 Mana per second, per Spirit.

What's the mana regen rate of arcane mages now that the 90 tier is decoupled from mana?
1+Haste*1.8% of base max mana per second.
EDIT: Fixed. Originally said 0.4%, but forgot that Mages have a hidden passive which gives them 4.5x.

Can multistrike melee hits proc "on melee hit" procs like killing machine and sudden doom?
No. Multistrikes cannot proc other things, unless those other things specifically call out that they proc from Multistrikes.

How will Blood in the Water feral execute, rip refresh on FB work with the panedmic mechanic. Will it grant a longer 130% duration Rip, or will it always reset to the base duration like it does now?
Fixed Blood in the Water and Touch of Chaos to be able to refresh up to 1.3x base duration. That'll be in the build after next.

Reminder for anyone working on Recount, Skada, etc... Filter out damage done to Prismatic Crystal. The Mage will cast an additional spell that does damage to enemies based on damage they deal to Prismatic Crystal, so if you include both, you'll be double-counting them.

Please confirm this. My current level 92 fire mage on alpha has 1.8% mana per second, which is almost an order of magnitude higher. My template 90 arcane mage also has much higher mana regen than this quoted number.

EDIT: 3330 combat regen mp5 according to tooltip on naked template 90 orc arcane mage. Mana pool is 37000, which gives 1.8% mana per second. Is the quoted mana regen implemented yet?

EDIT2: Fix numbers and here's a screenshot: 
3330 mp5 over 37000 mana pool, 3330/5 = 666, 666/37000 = 1.8%. This does not agree with quoted 0.4% figure.
Whoops. There's a passive that gives them 4.5x Mana regen, but I forgot that it's hidden, you don't see it. Yes, it's 1.8%, not 0.4%. Fixed the post above.

Thanks. Does this mana regen rate decay from level 90 to 100?
It does not.

#2 and #3 are currently not working. Sweeping strikes never multistrike, and multistrikes are not added to the ignite.
Yep, I fixed those late last week; check next build.

What is the mechanical philosophy behind Eminence and Atonement?
It varies. All stats benefit healing, but it's alright if only some stats benefit Atonement/Eminence, or only competitively benefit Atonement/Eminence. But lets keep this thread about theorycrafting, and leave the "why" and philosophy for other threads. Feel free to state what the values of each stat are based on theorycraft are to Atonement/Eminence though here, that's good data.

noticed that if Blood Craze is procced on consecutive autoattacks, it seems to become an ignite? It looked like it was adding the leftover dot into the next 3 ticks. Does that sound right?
Yep.

I noticed Resolve isn't meant to affect life% heals,but it affects Empowered Seals-->Insightwhich is op anyway at 5%hp/2 secs
Resolve will actually affect % heals, in most cases. Celestalon 
Ok, the thread just said Resolve does not affect percent-based heals i.e. "heals you for 20% of your life" would be unaffected
Oh, it does say that. I wrote that a bit ago; we're still discussing, and think it's worth trying if it does work on % heals. Celestalon 

Why do tanks need vengeance/resolve? Can't you just get rid of it?
It's so % reduction abilities ie Shield Block and flat reduction abilities ie Shield Barrier stay competitive with each other. Celestalon 
From a healer point of view, it makes them NPC that don't require much attention unless they have no idea what they're doing :/
That's not Resolve; that's the overall defensive power of tanks, which was too strong in Mists, and is coming way down in Warlords. Celestalon 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
is sunfire + astral showers getting a graphical update to reflect it's aoe effect?
It will not drop a beam on each target, just the center one; it does an impact visual on each other hit target though. Celestalon 

Can't post on us forum. What's the shooting stars chance for multiple moonfires? Still: base_chance * sqrtx/x ?
No, Shooting Stars is only the most recent Moonfire and Sunfire now. Celestalon 
Still 2.5% chance to proc? Seems farily low compared to 30% chance on crit live version.
No, 5%. Celestalon 

is there a way to recalculate, so that mastery procs doesnt count? it would be a shame if snapshot going away bc this
Yeah, we're working on a change to make it snapshot Balance Energy, and then dynamically turn that into Eclipse per tick Celestalon 

Do you have any plans of capping the amount you can extend MF/SF with Balance of Power like the old Starfire glyph?
You can extend it an infinite number of times, but the debuffs can never have a duration longer than 1.3x their normal duration. Celestalon 
These Q's confuse me. Lots of boomkin chatter but I can probably count the # of boomies I've seen in randoms on my fingers. WTH?
Seems like these changes will help the problem, no? Celestalon 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Possible to add a combatlog entry with the name of who Misdirection was cast on? Impossible to track with WeakAuras and others.
I believe it does in 6.0; test it when you get access and let me know if it doesn't. Celestalon 

Can we talk less about pets and more about why Bear Trap is such a terrible idea for a 2 minute cooldown?
I don't think it was a terrible idea, but its big reason for existing was removed, so we cut it. Celestalon 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
carrion swarm & supernova both could be used as an interrupt, yet the former is something you dont want warlocks to have, why?
Supernova is an alternate of Frost Nova; giving up Frost Nova is a big deal. Celestalon 

And on the back end of that, why not for arcane either, shouldn't arcane multis gain dmg from mastery and/or arcane charges?
Arcane's multistrikes do benefit from Mastery and Arcane Charges. Celestalon 

Are frosts frostbolt multistrikes supposed to proc the icicles? If so why do they work for ignite but not frost.
Multistrikes will be create Icicles and Ignites in the build after next. Celestalon 

Could you explain what the Supernova is supposed to do exactly? The knock-up looks tiny and doesn't seem to serve much purpose.
It may be on the weak side still. It's a short CC, but doesn't break on damage like freezes do, always interrupts, etc. Celestalon 
Not a bad idea though its going to need a pretty sizable shot in the arm to be useful. Thanks for the reply.
Ah, there's one change coming soon that I don't think has been mentioned yet: Supernova/Ice Nova/Blast Wave all have 2 charges now. Celestalon 

Nether Tempest appears to snapshot arcane charges, but update with mana and SP changes, tooltip confirms, intended?
Intended. Celestalon 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Will monk's +20% Blackout Kick perk work with Chi Explosion?
I believe so, though it doesn't really matter in practice; it'll be tuned around whichever way it is. Always have the perk. Celestalon 

Versatility: Will fistweaving double dip? How will it work for heals based on damage?
No; it affects them exactly once. 100dmg->100healing. With 10% Versatility, 110dmg->110healing. Celestalon 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Cant you make the talent gives the effects of Readiness without it being a stat?
Without the stat to support it, that's a significant amount of additional complexity. Celestalon 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Should Devouring Plague's duration decrease with Haste? Bonus orb talents and more DPs vs. smaller MF:I window.
No, Haste reduces the period and duration of Devouring Plague. Results in a consistent number of GCDs in each DP. Celestalon 
I thought haste wasn't going to be reducing dot durations, only moding the period? That not a thing?
Devouring Plague changed; it's not that kind of DoT anymore. Celestalon 
so its a nice nerf to shadow. Another one.
No, it's not a nerf. That's a change, not a nerf. Celestalon 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Currently, Death from Above sometimes only works when you're 10y away or so. Isn't it supposed to be used while in melee?
Ah, that's not range, that's the low ceiling; it's failing to path to the point in the air it's trying to get to. Will fix that. Celestalon 
Aye my bad. There's something to fix though, so I guess uploading the clip wasn't so useless after all. Thanks anyway.
No, not useless at all, good testing. Still a bug, just wasn't the cause you thought it was. Celestalon 

Saw Death from above on yt. Any chance we get a cool anim with it? Right now it's the plain jump anim with pull to trg
It has a unique visual; it's not even remotely the plain jump anim. Celestalon 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Sudden Death: will it proc from white only going forward, or is there a chance for Multistrike to replace SoO's contribution?
White only, and tuned accordingly. Celestalon 

Any thought what might replace Anger Management talent for warriors since Readiness isn't going to be put in the game?
It's staying for now, anyway, we'll just list the abilities on its tooltip, instead of saying to reference Readiness. Celestalon 

Character / Items
will the proc chance of WoD RPPM trinkets scale with haste? Or case by case basis?
General rule is that either the proc rate or the proc benefit scales with haste, not both. Celestalon 

Warlords of Draenor Stats
I thought the dps pots were still primary stat
Yeah, potions are primaries. Celestalon 

Also, does multi-strike trigger "on hit" effects, like killing machine proc off white hit or DK T75rune regen tier?
Not unless specifically called out as such. Celestalon 
is there an example spell that does call out for "on multistrike hit" you can give me? Thanks for the quick replies.
Blood Craze  is one. Few more in next build. Plans to add some to a few more specs. Celestalon 

Does that mean 66 ms rating will give two 1% chances to do an additional 30% dmg? And 80 haste rating = 1% haste?
Yes. Versatility undecided yet, but I'd guess somewhere around 130. Celestalon 

is armor mitigation going to be 75% or 85% in 6.0?
The cap will be 85%. Celestalon 
so using armor/armor+k_value means we'll see 29650 being the 85% cap?
Armor/Armor+K, but yeah. And it'd be 29660 with rounding. Celestalon 

PvP
Arent you afraid, that ne new sec. Stats will have a huge Impact in PvP? Even if these Stats are low? If not, why?
That's not a fear, that's an expectation. They most certainly will have an effect on PvP. That's not a bad thing, though. Celestalon 
Ah ok, you seems to be very relaxed. Why are you bringing these Stats in the Game, if you know, these can be "bad" for PvP?
It's a good thing when we add new content and systems to the game, especially in expansions. It keeps the game from getting stale Celestalon 
For sure! But doesent some Speccs sacle more with these stats than other? I think of "bursty" classes, which benefit too much.
We're tuning with these stats in mind. Celestalon 

World
I bet it's not tuned yet. per post on spell damage tuning.
No, it's tuned and consciously deadlier. Going for a leisurely swim in lava is silly. WatcherDev 

Misc
GC's Law: In social games, players fear the perception that they are uninformed more than the perception that they play badly.
Sort of an aside, but once I bought a recommended item and my friends busted my balls. That was a bad experience. holinka 
We will see win rates increase when we change recommended items.
It contributes to the original point that even though the choice was fine, the social element made it feel bad. holinka 
We see high ban rates for champions with low win rates, we assume because the pros are doing it.
This legit confuses the crap out of me. What makes people think the meta is the same at every skill level?
Back to Greg's original point, the fear of picking the "wrong champ" as defined by "the best" drives behavior holinka
