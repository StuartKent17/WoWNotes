IMO only cast times and nearly nothing else is just as bad as spam-instants. Neither make interesting situations.<br>
Well, philospohically, all-cast-times would be better than all-instants. However, we&apos;re at neither of those extremes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458325358488469504))<br>

Any changes to death knight presences? They are pretty much just passive aura buttons and do nothing to gameplay.<br>
They&apos;re exclusive passive bonuses. Some gameplay, though not a lot. But doesn&apos;t need to be a lot. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458701760693932032))<br>

Why was tranq made resto only? Some of my favorite moments through the years were clutch tranq saves as a feral<br>
Because we&apos;re reducing stackable raid utility like that. Want to return raid survival to being the healers&apos; job. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458702924974022656))<br>
But yet Mage raid CD is stackable with any throughput healer CD, how do you not see that as a potential issue?<br>
Errr... That&apos;s the point? Perhaps a misunderstanding of the goal? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458711466657329152))<br>

http://t.co/gw9GjjjVjl This thread basically sums up most thoughts on KS. The second charge is terrible and unreliable.<br>

how is the pandemic effect on dots going to effect Living Bomb explosion?<br>
Just like it works today, except with a 3.6sec overlap time, instead of [3/Haste]sec. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458306722596016128))<br>
Would this lead to situation where you always want to refresh LB at that point throughout a fight to get more explosions?<br>
No... That&apos;s the point. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458309958769983488))<br>
<br>
You said there are too many raid cooldowns and now you make a new one for mages. Why?<br>
Because we want to reduce them overall, but also balance them better. That means giving a small one to specs that have none. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/457974663818137600))<br>
6 raid cds at 100% effectiveness vs. 12 raid cds at 50% seems like no change besides more logistical headaches.<br>
Yes, but how about against 8 raid CDs at 50%? That&apos;s more accurately comparable to what we&apos;re doing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458447290592546816))<br>
Why not just give them to healers/tanks? That way nobody stacks certain DPSers due to raid CDs?<br>
A fair question. The answer is that we don&apos;t feel it&apos;s reasonable to completely remove them all. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458451218616954881))<br>
Do we cut Safeguard? Stampeding Roar? Demonic Portal? Sacred Shield? How many new talents would we have to create to fill holes? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458451696390131712))<br>

Are you taking away the snare from Fists of Fury for Windwalkers?<br>
You mean the stun? Nope. You can glyph it to trade the stun for the ability to move during it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/457682636052258816))<br>
<br>
Can all eminence healing be tied to statue?<br>
No, you don&apos;t want that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458073948748406784))<br>
Also, can the cd be removed from statue? Is there any -real- reason it has a cd to begin with?<br>
Well, it&apos;s so that you care about the position you choose, and don&apos;t feel like you&apos;re expected to constantly move it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458074463825711104))<br>
However, a decent argument could be made that 30sec is more restrictive than is needed for that purpose. We&apos;ll discuss it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458074624366874624))<br>
Removing the global would be a step, 30 seconds would be fine if it didn&apos;t cost a global.<br>
No, that&apos;d be terrible. Not being on the global would imply that you are absolutely supposed to min/max its placement on every CD. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458075314459918336))<br>
<br>
Or just like... make the statue do something else. It&apos;s pretty boring.<br>

seems we could ignore the current twisting talent as prot will only have two seals.<br>
Prot will indeed likely not use Seal of Insight much, without Empowered Seals. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458323249537884160))<br>
confused; if insight doesn&apos;t give prot haste or heal procs what would it do?<br>
Increased healing done. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458323876972228608))<br>
<br>
Warriors getting defensive benefits from crit; Paladins nothing? Insight loosing 10% haste, Righteous still to little dmg to use<br>
Yeah, this is all confusion. A) There&apos;s no more spell haste, just full haste. B) Holy Shield is likely undertuned; haven&apos;t tuned... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458311634662862848))<br>
...yet. C) Paladins get the exact same defensive benefit from Crit that Warriors do. D) Spell Haste from Insight didn&apos;t benefit... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458311963240431616))<br>
...you as Prot anyway. E) Righteousness will be worth using in the next build. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458312305663418368))<br>
thank you for responses. How did insight haste not help EF ticks? Seems like we have no good tanking seal now?<br>
We&apos;re moving the heal-on-hit proc from Seal of Insight to a Prot passive. We&apos;ll expect Prot and Ret to use Truth and Rightousness. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458319161442050048))<br>
On that topic, what sort of gameplay can we expect from Paladin seals in general? (for all specs)<br>
Ret/Prot will swap Seals more than Holy will. Seal of Righteousness will convert Crusader Strike into Hammer of the Righteousness (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458323127643021312))<br>
Curious. Wonder if Righteous will apply the Truth DoT now? That would be a welcome addition!<br>
No, it won&apos;t. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458328947873165312))<br>
<br>
concerning emp seals, any chance you guys are taking seals off of gcd and they share their own? Would feel clunky otherwise<br>
While it&apos;s an option, continue down that line of thinking. Where does it lead? What happens to your rotation? What buttons are used? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458823779850788864))<br>

.I assume a POM from the SAME priest will overwrite, and POM has &apos;weird&apos; bouncing rules... some protection might be warranted<br>
I don&apos;t believe there&apos;s anything to protect it from bouncing to a target that already has your PoM (overwriting), but it goes to... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459017988071358465))<br>
...a random injured target now, not the most injured, so that will be unlikely. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459018058980265984))<br>
well there wouldn&apos;t be anything now, you can&apos;t have more than 1 out. I would assume you could have more than 1 out with WOMPOM<br>
We&apos;re actually trying letting you have more than one out, anyway. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459021017449373696))<br>
<br>
Since casting POM on a DI proc, could both be your final WOMPOM stack.... and both overwrite/cancel at the same time. No?<br>
OK, we&apos;re going to try making it not bounce to targets you already have a PoM on. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459023766723387392))<br>

No current plans, but I can definitely see the appeal, especially for various cloth transmog looks. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/457679980013449216))<br>
<br>
Can we have new spell visual for melee (Rogue/War) that are concerned? SS/Ambush/RvS have the same visual to not mention others.<br>
Yeah, melee abilities tend to rely on animation more than visual effects, but we can definitely do more to make them feel epic. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/459010507622469632))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
have you guys thought about set bonuses for making gear be best for PVE or PVP?<br>
Past set bonuses made an effort to do that. It was never enough. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/459108865611558914))<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br>
Yea, it&apos;s a bit odd for tanks too. Stack Readiness to get another shield wall for a boss special or why get any?<br>
Luckily, it affects more than just 3min cooldowns. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458365064764854272))<br>
<br>
Gladstance going to disable Bonus Armor on gear? also does the armor factor into ilvl? I.E. Armor item on fury = less crit stat?<br>
Bonus Armor will actually provide DPS value for tanks. Yes, it&apos;s part of the item&apos;s budget. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458378387044564992))<br>
any tidbits about how? Thorns? Armored to the teeth? some new fangled quirky thing?<br>
A passive, Bladed Armor. Increases Attack Power by 100% of your Bonus Armor. (NOTE: Just *Bonus* Armor, not ALL Armor) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458387044905938945))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Will reincarnation consume a combat ress charge?<br>
No, just like with today&apos;s system, Reincarnation is a personal benefit that is outside the raid-level rules. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/457683115951935488))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
what is your opinion on the reflect meta-gem that is picked by almost 80% of all healer &amp; even some dps classes in arena<br>
It&apos;s a bit curious as the chance is small. What are your thoughts about it? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458648434975584256))<br>
<br>
if someone is pvp tagged in wod, and i heal them, will my ilevel increase too?<br>
yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458658769627787264))<br>
<br>
Regarding gear having 2 ilvls... If an Ally raid is fighting a World Boss and 1 Horde AoEs them, the raid gets their ilvls buffed?<br>
Yes, people could get into PvP to buff their DPS against world boss. It&apos;s a downside we can live with due to the upsides. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458681432618315776))<br>
I&apos;m just afraid it will be abused by people going for world 1st leveling, since they usually take a friend from another faction...<br>
I really don&apos;t think we should not do the right thing for PvP because of a concern about world first leveling. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458682584244183041))<br>
<br>
Don&apos;t you fear that some might exploit the ilvl activation on PvP in PvE (e.g. world bosses) for dps boost to the boss?<br>
It might happen but we&apos;re not concerned about it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458684862543974401))<br>
<br>
did you say solo queue skirmishes?<br>
I did (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458682742516244482))<br>
<br>
will there be hidden MMR in WoD skirmishes? please say yes <br>
Yes..but the matchmaking will be more focused on speed (i.e. we&apos;ll expand the search faster than say Rated Arenas) (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458688608988172289))<br>
<br>
can&apos;t wait to try out wod! Pvp is looking solid. Only concern is will pve gear still scale down in pvp instance?<br>
only mythic (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458676971514634240))<br>
my fear would mainly be legendaries, that would not be mythic. Would legendaries scale down in pvp instances too?<br>
The ilevel ceiling will work similar to now. PvP gear will ignore it but Mythic gear (&amp; Legendaries if it applies) will be reduced. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458683820561010688))<br>
<br>
I am curious about this as well, how can we see/compare the PVP stats when not in PVP?<br>
Hm, I see, so you&apos;re saying the ability to see what the stats will be when PvP, not just the ilevel. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458685517849034752))<br>
We haven&apos;t developed final solution for tooltip, but added this to video to illustrate the intent. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458685617883205632))<br>
Certainly good to get feedback on initial reaction. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458685711315501056))<br>
<br>
If my HP is 80k/100k; Horde hits me and max HP becomes 120k, does my HP stay at 80k or go to 96k (80%)?<br>
It stays relative so 96k. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458729906214408192))<br>
<br>
Why does PvE and PvP gear have to be different? Why can&apos;t they be the same item just obtained from different means?<br>
Conquest gear needs to at least match the best available raid gear for PvP, but is much more accessible by design. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/459033275629989888))<br>
<br>
we want this a lot but our UI time is heavily constrained so we can&apos;t promise it. (Russ Petersen (https://twitter.com/nite_moogle/status/458686334710722560))<br>
Yes, unfortunately a &quot;PvP mode&quot; on the character pane is a big technical challenge. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458686525979377664))<br>
[i]Also: you&apos;ll always be in &quot;PvP mode&quot; on Ashran, where gear vendors are.<br>
And there will be a PvP dummy to put yourself in combat. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458687515621216257))<br>
But still, gear tooltips can be improved. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458687574198849536))<br>
<br>
How about everyone can join the PvP Beta realm for better PvP testing? Other content is deactivated so no spoilers.. consider it!<br>
That will be the case. Anyone will be able to join the PvP Beta realm and all non-PvP content will be inaccessible. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458684289240940544))<br>
Just to clarify, that&apos;s anyone in beta. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458690092765179904))<br>
<br>
Professions<br>
quick question, with glyphs been gained as one levels, is it a waste to have inscription now compared to other professions?<br>
Not at all; it&apos;s just a handful of level-up glyphs to ease new players into the system. Most glyphs still come from scribes. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/458352829183172608))<br>
<br>
Lore<br>
You do realize that timetravel to the past is impossible because of closedform timecurves?Hawking &amp;Carroll are isomorphic on this<br>
yeah I don&apos;t get worked up about stuff like that. I&apos;m more about the fiction than the science. But can understand why some ppl do (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/457917334078754817))<br>
