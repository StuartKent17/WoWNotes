Warcraft Movie Interview
Entertainment Weekly  and Collider  both had interviews about the Warcraft movie recently.

Collider 

The original script just told the story from the Alliance point of view. Duncan Jones came on and wrote the script to include both the Alliance and Horde points of view.
The latest screenings of the movie have been extremely well received. 
The team is very satisfied with most of the movie, but they are still tinkering with it and going through the final process. 


Entertainment Weekly 

Fans will get a unique enjoyment from the movies, as they will be able to identify the Easter eggs.
The movie needed to be something you could watch even if you don't know anything about Warcraft while still making the players feel like it was their world. This is part of why the movie took so long. 
The BlizzCon crowd is the hardcore crowd, as they know the stories and world and are looking for a reflection of things they;ve experienced being in that world themselves.
Comic book movies used to have a stigma associated with them too, but eventually filmmakers made movies that you actually cared about and felt something for. The same thing is going on with videogame movies now. 
The first trailer has to do a lot introducing, as the movie shows a new world and characters that people aren't familiar with yet.



Blizzard Hiring for Classic Games
Blizzard posted a new position recently, hiring software engineers to fix up older games. This is likely related to the side project mentioned at Blizzcon 2013  that was updating older games to run on current versions of Windows.
Compelling stories. Intense multiplayer. Endless replayability. Qualities that made StarCraft, Warcraft III, and Diablo II the titans of their day. Evolving operating systems, hardware, and online services have made them more difficult to be experienced by their loyal followers or reaching a new generation.

We’re restoring them to glory, and we need your engineering talents, your passion, and your ability to get tough jobs done.

So if you like wearing many hats, know small teams are the most effective, and look forward to challenges that will create millions of new adventures for our players: we would love to hear from you.


Make gameplay first again on modern operating systems.
Create conditions for experiences that look as good as they play.
Own implementation and curation of features new and old.
Combat hacking to improve multiplayer.
Diagnose and fix all the things: crashes, deadlocks, overflows, heap corruptions, etc. 



Blizzcon - Community Amphitheater
There are several discussions going on at the Community Amphitheater at Blizzcon that won't be on the Virtual Ticket. We hope to be able to provide coverage of them, but it may not be live.
Saturday, November 7, 12:15 p.m.
Quick updates on Engineering discussion. First, it's a Q&A discussion in the Darkmoon Faire area, not a panel on one of the panel stages. Second, it's gonna be at 12:15 on Saturday, and last for an hour. We'll be doing some of the questions we got from Twitter, and polling the audience. The engineers involved are myself, @ben_deane from  , Timothy Ford from Overwatch, and Grant Mark from SC2/HOTS. We're super excited to do this, and we have a lot of good questions you've submitted. Thanks for your involvement. kurtismcc 

Friday, November 6, 2:45 p.m.
Scott Johnson, host of The Instance Podcast , will be kicking off casual conversation with lead narrative designer Dave Kosak and lead quest designer Craig Amai about how the rich fantasy of the Warcraft universe informs their design approach to Legion, from quest flow to artifact weapons and beyond.

Blue Tweets
PvP
Do you think after Legion the WOW PVP Scene will be a major contender in the eSports Arena?
No idea. Primarily focused on making it fun to play. holinka 

Lore
From what I got from you, demons are soulless right? How would they be animate then=[This is kinda confusing.
That I have no idea about, some like Xavius had their souls torn apart by Sargeras right? But does every demonic being have one? Muffinus 
Well, according to some sources fel consumes souls. Then we have sources stating fel energy also burns life.
Seems to be both, right? Some things consume soul shards, others use life to create mana, others use mana to kill life. Muffinus 

And if IIRC, the Nether is the realm of the dead?
No idea, man. What is the Light? Where did that one dude in Icecrown go when he ascended? Do the Naaru live there? Deep stuff. Muffinus 
I have no idea lol =] Maybe there's two realm of the dead. Heaven and Hell-opps
That's kind of the fun of Warcraft mysteries... Muffinus 
I love mysteries=] I can't help but think that the Observers are related to Old Gods tho. Dem tentacles
Old Gods are still super mysterious to me, I love their mythos and the creepy stained glass vibe. Muffinus 

Hey Dave, could we ever see a return of the Aspects?
The dragonflights will continue to have a big influence on Azeroth! DaveKosak 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
was there ever discussion during your tenure to add housing to WoW?
Concern was always that players stay in their houses and don't see other players. OccupyGStreet 

One thing that I always wanted to ask I would really like an answer to: why do blizz nerfs always with the hammer? no scappel
It can also be demoralizing to have a scalpel cut patch after patch after patch. OccupyGStreet 

why do you think Blizzard abandoned their core Vanilla/BC/SC1/D1 and D2 player base in favour of 'accessibility'?
I think "abandoned" is a very strong word. Blizzard has always strived for accessibility. OccupyGStreet 


Blizzard - Japanese Game Localizations
Blizzard updated the WoW, Diablo III, Overwatch, and Hearthstone websites to have a link to a Japanese version of the website. Obviously only Hearthstone has been released in Japanese  so far, so it is the only one that works. Blizzard has also been hiring for Japanese localization this year, along with two newer postings for a Project Manager  and Senior Marketing Manager  Keep in mind that none of this means that any other games are getting Japanese localizations.
