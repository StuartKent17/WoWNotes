The Lorewalker Stories
In Mists of Pandaria there are several extra lore related achievements  to go with the regular zone exploration achievements. 

For example, to complete Fish Tails  you must find small statues or other objects hidden around Pandaria and read the lore. Once you have found all of the objects for an achievement, Lorewalker Cho will send you mail that asks you to meet him at the Seat of Knowledge. Once there he will narrate a small story that gives you some more information about Pandaria lore. 

In the video below, the Fish Tails  and Ballad of Liu Lang  stories are told to you.

<img src="" style="margin-bottom:-2px; margin-right:0px; vertical-align:bottom" /> Cheating in Diablo III
Blizzard Entertainment has always taken cheating in any form in Blizzard games very seriously, and that's no different for Diablo® III. If a Diablo III player is found to be cheating or using hacks, bots, or modifications in any form, then as outlined in the Diablo III end user license agreement , that player can be permanently banned from the game. This means that the player will be permanently unable to log in to Battle.net® to play Diablo III with his or her account.

Playing Diablo III legitimately means playing with an unaltered game client. Doing otherwise violates our policies for Battle.net and Diablo III , and it goes against the spirit of fair play that all of our games are based on. We strongly recommend that you avoid using any hacks, cheats, bots, or exploits. Suspensions and bans of players that have used or start using cheats and hacks will begin in the near future.

Warden has been. Monitoring what's being tracked by the system is an important part of the process before banning in waves. We need to be sure the detections are accurate. It's a reminder of the rules and a promise that ban waves will commence shortly. Nothing more.

Achievements have been granted to players who previously completed their objectives, but were not correctly awarded completion credit.
