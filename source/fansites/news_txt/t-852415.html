Blizzard deployed another round of hotfixes today, the arcane mage changes are going live and Blizzard decided that it was time to increase the guild XP gains from raid bosses! <br>
Here you&apos;ll find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the recently released World of Warcraft: Cataclysm patch 4.0.6. Hotfixes are updates we make on our end without requiring you to download a new patch. Some of the hotfixes below will go live the moment they are implemented, while others may require your realm to be restarted to go into effect. Please keep in mind that some issues cannot be addressed without a client-side patch update. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied. Visit our Bug Report forum for a list of 4.0.6 known issues.<br>
<br>
February 15<br>
General<br>
<br>
The amount of guild reputation and guild experience gained from killing a raid boss has been dramatically increased, as the previous rate felt too low compared to the difficulty of progressing through raid content. This change will require a realm restart to take effect, which will be next Tuesday&apos;s weekly scheduled maintenance at the latest.<br>
<br>
Shield of Velen guards in The Exodar are now consistent with other &quot;royal&quot; city guards in terms of health, level, and damage.<br>

Epilepsy and elementals flashing death effect<br>
We&apos;ve actually seen a number of forum posts, and received a few letters on the elemental death effects. We have a task set to remove the flashes from the death effect, although as the work hasn&apos;t begun I couldn&apos;t accurately state when the change might make it in.<br>
<br>
In any case, we agree and we&apos;re going to be changing them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/158478/dear-blizepileptics-vs-elementals))<br>
<br>
Lag in 4.0.6<br>
To address these directly, we can&apos;t say what any individual ISP may look at when performing any sort of Quality of Service traffic management. There are numerous factors that a traffic management console can monitor and consider as an indicator that throttling a subscriber is required. Those settings and thresholds are between the ISP and, if they choose to divulge it, their subscribers. Blizzard is not directly privy to that information. All we can truly proffer is generic information regarding the technologies involved and how it may impact our users. (Source (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1965992365?page=20#400))<br>

Bandwidth requirements in the future<br>
As far as increased bandwidth requirements, nothing &apos;new&apos; is coming in the works, as far as I am aware, that will require enhanced bandwidth. Our published minimum system requirements can change at any time, depending on what improvements and innovations we introduce. What I am saying is that some issues people have been reporting have indeed been traced to their current throughput limitations. This isn&apos;t true across the board, but this is the root cause of some of the reports. (Source (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1965992365?page=20#400))<br>
