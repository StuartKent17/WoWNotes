Mist of Pandaria Talent Calculator Updated
The official Mists of Pandaria Talent Calculator has been updated and a couple of classes got major updates to their skills. http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage, http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest, http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior apparently all got significant updates and other classes got minor updates. 

We trust you’ve all had ample time to plug away on the Mists of Pandaria Talent Calculator. You may have even found a few mind-bottling class changes in the works you know, when things are so crazy it gets your thoughts all trapped, like in a bottle?.

To that end, we’re pleased to announce we’ve just released an update to the calculator! In addition to bug fixes, we've made some changes as a result of your feedback.

Keep in mind this is still a very early preview of the Mists of Pandaria talent system, which will likely continue to evolve during development of the expansion. We also don’t plan on making further updates to the calculator until we get much closer to our testing phase, but rest assured we’ll still be considering your feedback throughout the development process.
