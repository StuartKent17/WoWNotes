Legion Developer Interviews
Some other sites interviewed the developers about Demon Hunters and got a few answers that haven't been covered in other interviews.

There are still parts of the Dark Whispers event that players didn't figure out during the time it was active on beta. 
When you turn into a Dreadlord you get 6,666% additional health and raid boss power level abilities. 
Vengeance is probably a mid-tier tank when it comes to complexity. They have a lot utility in Mythic+ dungeons which makes them a little more complex, but a little less complex in raid tanking.

Legion invasion events will scale from Level 10 to 100.
Garrison building tech saved the day and allowed for the invasions to spawn in large buildings and really take over the zones.
The team didn't spend enough time in Warlords or make use of the assets and story there well. 
Legion is going to be a longer expansion with more patches so that the story is told well 
The Warlords quests that just required you to fill a bar with no story weren't great. 
The last two expansions together have taught the team where they need to spend their time and effort in terms of evolving WoW.
Not doing Demon Hunters until now means that their mobility and other things that weren't possible with Burning Crusade tech could be realized well.
