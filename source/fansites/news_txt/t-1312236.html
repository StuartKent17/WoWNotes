Casting While Moving<br>
I think the concept largely stems from the idea that casting a spell takes an extreme amount of concentration. Imagine, for example, a chef preparing a meal and chopping up a bunch of potatoes or something. Now imagine him doing it at a brisk jog. Somehow that seems... unsafe, at best.<br>
<br>
Obviously there are gameplay reasons why a spell would be castable while moving, but even then, one could argue that part of the &quot;strength&quot; of that spell is the ability to do so. Maybe a Lightning Bolt is fairly easy for a Shaman to cast while standing still, but it takes a lot of focus to be able to fire one off while running.

Patch 5.4 Holy Paladin Changes<br>
Hi there Jmax, I&apos;m here with more information from our developers to provide more context behind some of the recent changes to Holy Paladins on the 5.4 PTR.<br>
<br>
Intent behind the Eternal Flame change<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ve made some changes to Eternal Flame because we feel the talent was being overrepresented within the Holy Paladin population.<br>
<br>
Our intent for was for Holy Paladins to pick Selfless Healer if they like to Judge, Eternal Flame if they like heal-over-time spells, and Sacred Shield if they liked damage absorb shields. As it worked out, most every Holy paladin chose Eternal Flame, and we don&#x2019;t want every Holy paladin to be a heal-over-time machine. (That&#x2019;s a niche best served by Restoration Druids and Holy Priests.)<br>
<br>
We don&#x2019;t think Holy Paladin&#x2019;s healing throughput is too high overall (though we&#x2019;ll gather more information from testing on the 5.4 PTR), so our intent is not to nerf but to reduce reliance on Eternal Flame. One of the biggest problem with Eternal Flame is the way it interacts with the Illuminated Healing mastery, which turns the heal-over-time spell into a potent shield as well. If needed, we will compensate by buffing healing elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Our plans for now, are to revert the nerf that was done to the initial healing component of Eternal Flame, but we are unlikely to change the Illuminated Healing back to the way it was. <br>
<br>
Sacred Shield<br>
<br>
Regarding Sacred Shield, we tried giving the talent as a baseline ability to Protection, but we&#x2019;re unhappy with that experiment and are likely to revert the change. We agree that the current (old) version of Sacred Shield is more attractive to Holy than the (new) version. We also would likely have to nerf Protection to compensate for getting Holy Shield in addition to another talent. Overall, we think the current (old) version of Sacred Shield is a better design. Perhaps we can still make Sacred Shield more attractive for Holy and Retribution, and make the other two talents (Selfless Healer, Eternal Flame) more attractive to Protection. <br>
<br>
Our goal<br>
<br>
We understand that Selfless Healer requires a certain playstyle that not every Holy paladin will find attractive. So we want to make Eternal Flame and Sacred Shield feel like viable talent choices as well.<br>
<br>
Mastery not benefiting from Execution Sentence or Light&#x2019;s Hammer isn&#x2019;t intended and probably just got caught in the change to make Eternal Flame&#x2019;s heal-over-time not benefit with mastery. We will correct that.<br>
<br>
Remember, at this early stage in the PTR, our designers&#x2019; focus are on implementation changes (mechanics) first, and tuning changes (numbers) later. Your feedback at this stage will be more helpful to be focusing on the mechanics (e.g. &#x201C;I liked using hots&#x201D; or &#x201C;I like to Judge and wish I could use Selfless Healer more&#x201D;) and less on &#x201C;OMG 30% nerf.&#x201D; (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/262957-54-holy-paladin-opinions-feedback-and-ideas/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9344634569?page=1#2))<br>

Patch 5.4 Kil&apos;Jaeden&apos;s Cunning Update<br>
There&apos;s been a lot of discussion on the topic of Kil&apos;Jaeden&apos;s Cunning in 5.4 but we&apos;ve got some new info, and since that thread is growing rather large I think it&apos;s best to start up a new one.<br>
<br>
We&apos;ve been following all of your feedback very closely, and we&apos;re going to try a different approach to Kil&apos;Jaeden&apos;s Cunning in 5.4.<br>
<br>
In a future PTR build, Kil&apos;Jaeden&apos;s Cunning will once again be a passive effect. Selecting it will allow the Warlock to cast Malefic Grasp, Shadow Bolt, and Incinerate while moving. There is no penalty, so you&apos;ll be able to move at full speed.<br>
<br>
We still feel that the 5.3 version of Kil&apos;Jaeden&apos;s Cunning isn&apos;t working out, but we don&apos;t want to &quot;nerf fun&quot; either. It&apos;s clear that many Warlocks simply enjoy the feel of being able to cast on the move, and we&apos;d like to be able to preserve as much of that feeling if possible.<br>
<br>
With this change, we can make the &quot;penalty&quot; of taking KJC that you don&apos;t have Mannoroth&apos;s Fury or Archimonde&apos;s Vengeance, which should result in more damage output in cases where movement is less critical (and we&apos;re working on some changes to Archimonde&apos;s Vengeance that should help with that). We&apos;re also still planning on buffing Fel Flame in a way that helps lower the impact to mobility caused by choosing one of those talents over Kil&apos;Jaeden&apos;s Cunning, without nerfing it for PvP purposes.<br>
<br>
Remember, we&apos;re still extremely early in the PTR process. There will be many more changes to the game before the patch goes live.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the update. So just to be clear, Mannoroth&apos;s Fury is still on track to be 10 secs up, 60 sec CD with the increase to range and damage? <br>
Yes. Again, PTR is PTR and anything can change, but we do like how the new Mannoroth&apos;s Fury makes it a clear DPS boost in AoE situations.

<br>
<br>
Patch 5.4 Pet Battle PvP Timer Changes<br>
We have received feedback where players said that their opponent ran out the whole 30 seconds every turn, which made him wait too long in the battle. Therefore, we are ready to add a new feature in Patch 5.4: In a PvP pet battle, if one side doesn&apos;t take action within 15 seconds, the system will reduce the time that player can use in the next turn as a penalty. This change is intended to accelerate the pet battle and make it more compact.<br>
<br>
Currently, the system works as follows (numbers below are subject to change):<br>
<br>
Each side has 30 seconds for each turn in the initial state, but if one side doesn&apos;t do anything in one turn within 15 seconds, then the time that player can use in the next turn will be reduced by (time used in the last turn - 15) / 2 seconds and the total time that player can use in all turns will be reduced by (time used in the last turn - 15) / 10 seconds.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
If one player uses 25 seconds in one turn, then the time that player can use in the next turn will be reduced by (25 - 15) / 2 = 5 seconds, which only affects the next turn. The total time that player can use in all turns will be reduced by (25 - 15) / 10 = 1 second, which affects the whole battle and stacks, but it will reduce the time that can be used in one turn by 15 seconds at most. Therefore, he has 29 - 5 = 24 seconds to decide in the next turn.<br>
