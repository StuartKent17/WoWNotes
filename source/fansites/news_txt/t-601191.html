<br>
Because 2.1.0 is not yet on the PTR&apos;s (we&apos;re hoping by tomorrow or early next week), we&apos;re going to hotfix the base creature respawn in Serpentshrine and TK Raid to be 2 hours. We&apos;re also going to fix the bug that&apos;s causing the creatures to respawn after the boss for the corresponding section has been killed.<br>
<br>
These aren&apos;t all of the changes that we have for 2.1.0, just two of the ones that we will be able to hotfix. There are more changes coming in 2.1.0 that include creature tuning, better loot etc...<br>
<br>
Some examples:<br>
<br>
Lots of the creatures have fewer hitpoints<br>
Lots of the creatures are no longer immune to CC (The female naga in SSC can be poly&apos;d, Skeletal Ushers in KZ can be shackled)<br>
Lots of bug fixes<br>
