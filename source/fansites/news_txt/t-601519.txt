Boubouille2007-07-11, 08:43 PMA new expansion for WoW Trading Card Game named "Fires of Outland" will be released in late August. As usual with new expansions it will include new loots cards, and amongst them is a new mount : the spectral tiger. 

Goblin Gumbo : Allows your character to occasionally burp outlandish gas on your friends !
Fishing Chair : Lets you relax under your own personal umbrella while you fish for those big lunkers that add powerful attributes to your character when cooked! Players will love this!
The Spectral Tiger Mount : No need to comment on this one....absolute coolness factor!
