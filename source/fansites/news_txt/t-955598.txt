World first Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest by Siiz US-Senjin / Premonition
Siiz http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/senjin/Siiz/advanced from Premonition http://premoguild.com/forums/portal.php US - Sen'jin was the first player in the world to acquire Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71086/dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest/! Congratulations to him.

And to answer the top 2 questions about the mount portion of the staff: 



The mount has a 1.5 sec cast time just like any other mount.
People can't ride on your back. 
The giant dragon in the 2nd screenshot isn't the mount, it's Tarecgosa during the end event of the questline.
