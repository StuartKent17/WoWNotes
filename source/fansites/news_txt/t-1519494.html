Is Necrotic Strike really absorbing 100% of attack power in WOD instead of 225% on live ? Or is the tooltip still bugged in WOD<br>
What &quot;100% of Attack Power&quot; means has changed. Formulae aren&apos;t comparably like that between 5.4 and 6.0. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464700143095144448))<br>
Yep, I know, 100% in WOD is like 50% on live. So 100% NS comared to 225% on live is like a 4/5 nerf !<br>
It&apos;s simply not that simple. Rest assured, it won&apos;t be a useless button, as you fear. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464702035112116224))<br>
<br>
still feel like the level 75 (soon 60) dk talents are the worst in game. No other class requires talents for resource generation<br>
Why does it matter to you whether a core part of your gameplay comes from talents or from baseline skills? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464709556539363328))<br>
it&apos;s not as much that as it is that the dk talents aren&apos;t compelling in any way. No choices that add depth to our gameplay.<br>
Not sure what you&apos;re talking about. Which rune regen talent you take has a big impact on your gameplay, and adds depth. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464719209381912576))<br>
yes, they have a big impact on how we play. In that they&apos;re required in order for us to not have obscene amounts of downtime.<br>
Curious; I hear talking like this thrown around often, but I&apos;m dubious of how many people even try playing without for comparison. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464720600515104768))<br>
you ever tried leveling a dk now from scratch? The difference is immediate, noticeable, and immense.<br>
Yes, and that has a ton to do with gear and abilities available as well. Fact is, that row accounts for about 10-15% of your GCDs. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464721558942912513))<br>
And that&apos;s big, certainly, especially feeling-wise, which is why we moved it down to lvl 60 for 6.0. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464721850077937665))<br>
I don&apos;t think you truly understand DK&apos;s. If you don&apos;t choose BT you&apos;re doing it wrong.<br>
I think you may be confusing &quot;Unholy DKs in PvP&quot; for &quot;All DKs&quot;. BT is not used by the majority of DKs, and they&apos;re not wrong. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464805151572639744))<br>
<br>
Will the new Pestilence be usable without a target, like current Blood Boil? A very useful counter against stealth in PvP!<br>
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465617474751180800))<br>
<br>
am I going to have to actually use army or us it going back to being a cosmetic thing?<br>

Raidwide healing recieved is way too big raid utility (when other dps healing utility gone). Raids will stack mages<br>
Why would they stack Mages? Where&apos;s the logic? Your &quot;way too big&quot; seems to be based on hyperbole, not fact. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464833699595313152))<br>
Thats my point - stacking Mages will save heal. therefore I take 5-6 Mages as dps and can afford less healer<br>
A 12% increase to healing received is minor. Same as Smoke Bomb. Or Rallying Cry. Or all the others competing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464806186089316352))<br>
<br>
But mages already have bloodlust, iceblock, frost ring, etc. Why do they need another?<br>
Bloodlust is not stackable raid utility. It&apos;s like being able to give a crit buff. Ice Block and Ring of Frost are... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464832577434431488))<br>
...extremely small, in the grand scheme of things, as far as raid utility goes, in most situations. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464832900978847744))<br>
With that logic why not give every class a bloodlust? Don&apos;t get why mages get love over rogues (who need it)<br>
Because you have raid buffs and debuffs in order to make you stronger in a group, and diversify compositions. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464833942084788224))<br>
<br>
The problem is that you give a DPS a stackable raidwide &quot;Heal-Support&quot; skill like Amplify Magic for Mages...<br>
Yes, we give them a small one, because they had none, and lower everyone else down to equally small. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464718088965873665))<br>
<br>
The mirror images will get their spell power increase but will they get health/resist as well? For more survivability.<br>
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465617534398365697))<br>
<br>
Any chance we see a variation of Cone of Cold for arcane? Maybe &quot;Arcane Pulse&quot; - Push back and increased dmg?<br>
Arcane&apos;s AoE is naturally a short range instant; too much overlap. Supernova is somewhat similar to what you describe. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465618301704364032))<br>

Is there any chance for Glyph of Touch of Death and Glyph of Touch of Karma to become baseline in WoD? They kinda feel mandatory<br>
Glyph of Touch of Death is a kiss/curse; definitely not mandatory, at all. Glyph of Touch of Karma is strong, especially in Arenas. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464708053946740736))<br>
Also i don&apos;t see how to use Karma while being slowed, rooted or feared to china. That Glyph is a must have, no room for decision<br>
In many cases, those are bad times to use ToK anyway. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464710276537778176))<br>
How should i get off a ToK against a ranged then? I&apos;d like to set it on my target not some rnd pet standing next to me.<br>
Presumably, the same way you punch that ranged. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464718271069945858))<br>
<br>
any chance that chi torpedo be changed for ww to be something competitive with rjw and xuen?<br>
Chi Torpedo is lacking for everyone, since RJW was changed to its current version. We&apos;re considering potential changes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464725840077393920))<br>

Why does BrM taunt have 10y longer range and have the movement on application?<br>
Why not? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/464903346566881281))<br>
Taunt is simple ability. Why would 1 out of 5 taunts be better in every way?<br>
Brewmasters have the best taunt (though I could see someone saying DKs do). Doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re the best tank. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/464910274311372801))<br>
<br>
Problem with that is it takes 2 globals for monks to do as much ST healing as other healers do in 1.<br>
Not actually. Soothing only has a 0.5sec GCD. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465275510969217024))<br>
well this is new, it will still take longer to switch targets after a surging though<br>
If you&apos;re only doing 1 Surging, perhaps. It also is more front loaded. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465276707885174786))<br>
Won&apos;t just 1 surging be fairly common though in world where spot healing is necessary and encouraged?<br>
Soothing would be better in this case. Surging on top if you really have to. And of course Renewing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465617439649050625))<br>

Any changes being discussed about AoW for Rets? Worried that if exo is low priority again that it&apos;ll be an unused proc again.<br>
Kinda confused about why people focus on AoW; it&apos;s just Exo that&apos;s weak, nothing specific to AoW. Just a tuning issue. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464827354297024512))<br>
If it&apos;s just a tuning issue why wasn&apos;t there a hotfix on it?<br>
Because we didn&apos;t want to change Ret&apos;s rotation through a hotfix. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464879498169577472))<br>
Not rebalancing classes through hotfixes &quot;mid xpack&quot; feels lazy from your part. Hello Disc... zzzZzzZz<br>

I agree to some extent, I believe if ShadowStep was on a 15-16 second cd it would on par with BoS and more competitive<br>

<br>
The current numbers imply BS will be much more superior to Hemo in WoD compared to now.<br>
