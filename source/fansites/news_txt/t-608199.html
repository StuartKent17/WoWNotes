Kil&apos;jaeden Soul Flay Hotfix<br>
Soul Flay now targets the player with the highest threat against Kil&apos;jaeden, regardless of the distance between the player and Kil&apos;jaeden.<br>
We&apos;ve just deployed a hotfix to all regions that changes the targeting behavior of Kil&apos;jaeden&apos;s Soul Flay ability. The ability now has a much simpler rule to determine who will be targeted.<br>
<br>
Soul Flay now targets the player with the highest threat against Kil&apos;jaeden, regardless of the distance between the player and Kil&apos;jaeden. The normal threat buffer that prevents a creature from changing targets to someone outside of melee range does not exist with Soul Flay. Soul Flay will still not target a player who is immune, however.<br>
<br>
This change will likely change some of the strategies currently used by players against Kil&apos;jaeden, but our intention is not to make the encounter any more or less difficult. This change should result in a more consistent, more understandable, and more enjoyable Kil&apos;jaeden fight.<br>

Carrot on a stick stacking / getting it back<br>
I think it&apos;s been well established that the riding crop does not stack with the carrot on a stick/spurs/enchant, as well as the proper way to request an item restoration by petitioning our in-game support.<br>
<br>
That aside, we wouldn&apos;t make an item obtained in the 30&apos;s level range work with any future speed increases, either now or in the foreseeable future. We would effectively be requiring people to either go back and complete the quest if they hadn&apos;t, or doom our in-game support to hundreds of thousands of petitions for item restorations which could probably not be met. Save yourself the hassle, all you need is the riding crop. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=6762241485&amp;pageNo=3&amp;sid=1#54))<br>

Naxxramas-80 in WotLK<br>
It will be an entry raid dungeon, yes, but if you are in the same group that was able to complete it at level 60, I doubt you will be in there too long, so it will work out for the more experienced raiders as well. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=6760111649&amp;pageNo=2&amp;sid=1#25))<br>
While some groups will blaze through that version as well, there will be a number of them that struggle on it as well, it won&apos;t be a cakewalk from one version to the other really. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=6760111649&amp;pageNo=2&amp;sid=1#29))<br>

Multiple alternatives to the Amani War Bear after its removal from the game<br>
Not an Amani Warbear, but we plan to have other bears out there at some point. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=6760111595&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#9))<br>

Long quest chains and rewards<br>
It depends on what you consider &quot;end-game content&quot;, there is already a lot of quests that can be complete solo that are the end-game of solo play - some of them are a fairly long series as well and they will reward players with gear appropriate for the level of difficulty (like the blue item rewards). Some of these series in The Burning Crusade required players to go through the 5 person dungeons, so these things already exist to a degree.<br>
<br>
We have always put a lot of quests into our new zones and Northrend will be no exception. As players hit the new level cap, the challenges will grow and that is what leads players to focus on the 5 person dungeons, then the heroic dungeons, then on into raiding. If players were able to complete a long quest chain while solo-ing and it provided end-game gear, then it would be like removing raiding (as I previously brought up) because this would allow players who play a lot to race through it all and get things very quickly. So the rewards for any series of quests or dungeons will always need to be on par for the challenge and not automatically end-game gear.
