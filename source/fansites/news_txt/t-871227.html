New Valor Points and Daily Dungeons gains in Patch 4.1<br>
We finally have a blue posts about the changes to daily quests!<br>
Right now, you receive 70 VP for the first random Cataclysm Heroic dungeon you complete each day. In 4.1, you&apos;ll receive 70 VP for the first seven random Cataclysm Heroic dungeons you complete each week. Similarly, you&apos;ll receive 140 VP for the first seven random Rise of the Zandalari Heroic dungeons (the new Zul&apos;Aman and Zul&apos;Gurub instances) you complete in the week, too. Collectively, you&apos;ll be able to earn up to 980 VP exclusively from Heroic dungeons, which in turn will count towards your weekly 1250 VP cap.<br>
<br>
By transitioning random Heroic dungeon rewards from a daily format to a weekly one, we&apos;ll be able to give players more control and flexibility over how they can earn VP -- which is cool! -- but this also means that we&apos;ve a lot more bookkeeping to do in terms of where those points are coming from. To help with that, we&apos;re adding a &quot;Valor Point bar&quot; (similar to an XP bar) to the top of Dungeon Finder UI that will track your weekly cap, as well as how many Heroics you can still run for VP during the week.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re going to be writing up a pretty big blog about that system since it&apos;s somewhat complicated, but here&apos;s what you can take away right now:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In 4.1, running random Heroic dungeons for VP is now something you can do on your own schedule. Feel like spending your entire Saturday queuing up as random? No problem!<br>
<br>
<br>
The first seven random Rise of the Zandalari Heroics you run for the week will award 140 VP each. This is double the VP that you&#x2019;ll receive from your first seven random &quot;tier 1&quot; Cataclysm Heroics, since the dungeons are considered a &quot;step up&quot; in difficulty.<br>
<br>
<br>
You&apos;ll be able to randomly queue for the Rise of the Zandalari Heroics separately from the tier 1 Cataclysm Heroic dungeons.<br>
<br>
<br>
Each week you can earn up to 980 VP just by running random Heroic dungeons. If you want to maximize your VP gains, you can still reach the overall weekly cap of 1250 by defeating raid level content.<br>
<br>
<br>
This isn&apos;t yet on the PTR for testing. We&apos;ll let you know when it is, though, and will continue to provide more information as the development of 4.1 progresses.<br>

RSA Vulnerability and Blizzard Authenticators<br>
The Blizzard Authenticators are based off modified Vasco tokens. I&apos;m sorry to hear about RSA&apos;s troubles, but it will not affect the Blizzard Authenticator. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/164619/rsa-compromise-concerns-about-authenticators))<br>

People blocking mailboxes with flying mounts<br>
You may have noticed that a number of mailboxes were added to the capital cities so that, if you happen to find one blocked, it should be relatively easy to walk a few steps and find another one that remains unobstructed. Most vendors are located inside buildings where mounts aren&apos;t allowed too.<br>
<br>
Having the option to use one&apos;s flying mounts within the capital cities is ultimately more convenient than removing them to ensure access to services which should be reasonably accessible to begin with. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/164703/take-away-the-dragons))<br>
<br>
<br>
Heroic Instance Tiers<br>
But, yes. The Rise of the Zandalari Heroics are considered a tier above the current Cataclysm Heroics. You can randomly queue for them separately, but you&apos;ll still only be able to earn at most 980 VP per week from running Heroics, period (no matter what tier they are).

Reasons behind the change to daily dungeon<br>
Some people don&apos;t have time to log in every day, but have, for instance, a lot of time on the weekend to play.<br>
We hear you, and we agree that asking players log in every day (or night) just to keep pace with their VP is a bit unreasonable and can sometimes lead to World of Warcraft feeling less like a game and more like a job. That&apos;s ultimately why we&apos;re making these changes. We want you to log in because you enjoy raiding, or questing, or -- in this case -- running dungeons, not because you feel like you need to complete a specific chore every day in order to stay viable/competitive.

Amount of instances in a week<br>
It sounds like you meant that you could do 7 total heroics; not 7 tier 1 AND 7 ZG/ZA... so its possible to get a TOTAL of 980 VP (Source (It sounds like you meant that you could do 7 total heroics; not 7 tier 1 AND 7 ZG/ZA... so its possible to get a TOTAL of 980 VP))<br>
<br>
<br>
Hitting the cap with the new dungeon dailies<br>
Even with only doing the dungeons (both types), you&apos;ll hit the cap before the week is over, without stepping foot into a raid.<br>
Nah, you won&apos;t. You&apos;ll only be able to earn up to 980 VP per week from running random Heroics, not 1470 VP (we&apos;re purposefully placing a soft cap on VP from Heroics). If you want to reach the 1250 weekly cap, you&apos;ll still need to run raid content.<br>
<br>
Again, I know it&apos;s a bit complicated, so let me give you some examples:<br>
<br>
Example 1:<br>
Player A has a blast on a Friday with his friends and runs seven Rise of the Zandalari Heroics, earning 980 VP (7 x 140 VP). The next day, he helps a friend with a random tier 1 Cataclysm Heroic -- let&apos;s say Heroic Deadmines. Because player A has already earned 980 VP from random Heroics, he won&apos;t receive any VP from the Saturday&apos;s Deadmines run.<br>
<br>
Example 2:<br>
Player B kills 25-man Argaloth, Council of Wind, and Halfus Wyrmbreaker, earning 270 VP on Tuesday night. She then runs three random tier 1 Cataclysm Heroics during the workweek for 210 VP. Come Saturday, player B wants to kill LOTS of trolls and decides to chain-run a few random Rise of the Zandalari Heroics. At this point, player B has 770 VP available to be earned from Heroic dungeons (980 VP - 210 VP). This means she can run six of those dungeons -- for the first five, she&apos;ll get 140 VP; for the sixth, only 70 VP.<br>
<br>
Example 3:<br>
Player C raids a lot of bosses, killing 10 of them with 24 of his peers on Tuesday/Wednesday, earning 900 VP. He can still earn 350 VP before hitting the weekly cap. The 980 VP Heroic dungeon cap won&apos;t affect him at this point. He can do five tier 1 Heroics -- or three Rise of the Zandalari Heroics, or two Rise of the Zandalari Heroic + one tier 1 Heroic -- to earn those 350 VP.<br>
<br>
This is all much easier to understand with pictures (which we&apos;ll be sure include in spades in the blog post), but I hope the above makes sense for now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/164622/abolish-the-daily-valor-points-from-heroics))<br>
