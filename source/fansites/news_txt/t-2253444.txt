Black Temple Added to Burning Crusade Timewalking
During the Burning Crusade Timewalking week, you can head to Black Temple with a 10-30 player group to take on the bosses that drop item level 900 loot. The difficulty has been set a little bit below Normal difficulty and the raid will require a premade group.


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/june/btTimewalkingBanner.png http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6690-Black-Temple-Timewalking 

What’s New?
Head to Outland to face Illidan and his cohorts once more in our first Timewalking raid: The Black Temple!

The Black Temple raid will be available throughout the Burning Crusade Timewalking event. The difficulty is set to Normal and, like any Normal-level raid, will not be available through Raid Finder. To take on this challenge, you’ll need to get your guild or a group of friends together, or head to Group Finder > Premade Groups. The raid scales for your group size between 10 — 30 players and your level and gear will be scaled back to match the raid’s challenges.

Want to relive the time you first defeated Teron Gorefiend? Face face, face the Reliquary of Souls once more? Witness the showdown between Maiev and Illidan before the final fight? Now’s your chance. Inside you can earn transmog sets, the pets you need for Raiding With Leashes III, a Music Roll: The Burning Legion, and gear drops of ilvl 900. And for Demon Hunters, there’s the enticing possibility of obtaining the legendary Warglaives of Azzinoth. Are you, this time, prepared?


Jump Into PvP Brawls: Deep Six– July 11-July 18
Who has your six in this six vs. six brawl? Deep Six will put you and your group to the test — running July 11-July 18.

Every other week, a new PvP Brawl will be available to players looking for something just a little different. Each Brawl will offer a variety of modes, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay, and you’ll find them in the Group Finder tool hotkey “I” in the Player vs. Player tab. Just like Random Battlegrounds, you’ll receive a reward for achieving victory. Here are just a few of the Brawls you can look forward to:

Deep Six pits teams of six players against each other in three iconic Battlegrounds: Warsong Gulch, Silvershard Mines, and Temple of Kotmogu. Each Battleground offers a little variation on the traditional format, such as flags that are a bit closer in Warsong Gulch, less carts to keep track of in Silvershard Mines, and only two orbs within the Temple of Kotmogu.


Blue Posts
Forum Downvote Button Removed
Yes, we’ve recently pushed an update to the WoW forums that removes the ability to downvote posts made by other players.

We originally added this feature as a means for players to assist with forum moderation by upvoting helpful posts and downvoting inappropriate or toxic posts. In practice, however, we found that it was primarily being used for things like downvoting a post simply because they disagreed with it, which was not the intent, and too often led to different opinions getting unfairly buried. Moving to an upvotes-only environment will remove this unintended abuse, while still allowing players to give recognition to posts that have a positive impact on the World of Warcraft community.

As a reminder, you can still report inappropriate or abusive posts to the moderation team by selecting the “Report Post” option located in the dropdown menu on the right of the offending post.

Really? I don't like a post, I hit the button labeled DISLIKE... Remove like as well or you blizzard as a whole is just doing this to make it look like there are no issues. Cover-ups never go well.
Covering up what exactly?... Posts that disagree with design, for example, can still be liked by players which can indicate to us its something to look into, etc.

The ability to troll threads with downvotes, or downvoting for the sake of disagreement was the prime reason for removal here, and it nay make some increase in workload on the moderation side, but nothing we can't handle.

Let's take off our tin foil hats here.

I don't think this will work like you think it will ...
A good example of the reason for this fall to specific examples, and there are many, but one we see often that ends up pushing people away from the forums is...

For example, if a Paladin posts in the Paladin class forum about something the 'general' Paladin community doesn't feel is important, they were just downvoted to oblivion, often with no context. We'd much rather people engage in meaningful conversation with each other to convey those kind of things, and, even if they don't, the poster of the thread doesn't feel worthless for posting a thread that ended up with -70 votes for no reason.

There's not really a bad outcome here, but we will keep an eye on the change going forward, and we encourage posters to report posts that are toxic or against our Forums Code of Conduct.

We built a much larger, scaled moderation team since the downvote feature was implemented, and they are typically quick to react to these types of things to remove them entirely, and we will work with our moderation team to adjust to react to this as well.

Downvoting doesn't really serve a purpose with that kind of thread in the bigger picture, as people can still read it.

Clicking the button that said "Dislike" on a post we didn't like was now, according to a blue, trolling?

Covering up quite a bit actually. If there's a lot of disliked comments on a topic, good chance it's not popular of the forum population opinion. By only allowing the like button to continue you're pushing any opinions that are not +1 out of the game. If someone can add a +1, someone else should be able to add a -1, or you're promoting a false utopia of upvotes...

Many of the downvoted threads did not warrant a full reply. The dislike button was enough to say "I don't like this".
*puts on tin foil hat*

It wasn't the *original* intention. I wasn't here when it was implemented, and maybe there was a poor word choice on the button, but we're a bit past that now.

And now if there's not a lot likes, then it's still not popular? 

I think your concern is how do we know x is popular versus y and z wheras x may be a disagreement about game design and y may be a thread about Illidan lore. Things will be compared on the bigger picture now instead of thread by thread, which is how we've been doing it for a long, long time to be honest.
