MMO-Champion Forums Moderator Recruitment<br>
Good news everyone! We&apos;re recruiting moderators for the forums again! The amount of users and posts keeps increasing at a very fast pace and we reached the point where we need some help before the trolls take over and play Whack-a-Mod in the new Darkmoon Faire. I know it sounds fun, but I&apos;m going to assume we don&apos;t want that. <br>
<br>
This time around we especially need people to mods for our forums for other games such as the SWTOR forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/339-Star-Wars-The-Old-Republic). We are always up for adding nice new mods though, so feel free to apply for the other forums as well.<br>

A Day in the Life of a Web Content Manager<br>
&lt;div style=&quot;float:left;width:190px;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/december/GeoffTheWebContentMan.jpg&quot; width=&quot;172px&quot; height=&quot;117px&quot;/&gt; (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/b20/interviews.html#fourthInterview)&lt;/div&gt;His bicycle tires don&apos;t run flat; they explode. When news breaks, he fixes it. His collection of vintage Blizzard memorabilia could fill a garage... and it does. They made a Diablo creature in his honor, but it was deemed too frightening to include in the game. The people of Orgrimmar love him, even though he plays Alliance. He is the most interesting web content manager in the world. He doesn&apos;t always like to be in the spotlight, but when he does, Geoff prefers to be featured in a Day in the Life article.<br>

Deathwing should not have been in LFR<br>
I don&apos;t agree at all with a couple months. I think maybe it could have maybe been delayed to the week after Heroic and still been pretty awesome though.<br>
<br>
There&apos;s a lot of prestige and reward that goes with the Heroic kills that simply just aren&apos;t matched by any kills in the Raid Finder version. If someone is comparing the two or getting confused by the kills between them then I think their opinion is already flawed.<br>
<br>
Kills happened in Normal before Raid Finder. You could argue those were &quot;real&quot; kills.<br>
<br>
Our goal with Raid Finder is not to hold people back for months just to make sure the Heroic kills feel even more elite and special than they already do. Those players were probably already responsible for world or server first Normal kills, and then the rewards from Heroic speak for themselves as being fairly substantial.<br>
<br>
In any case, as a first go with the Raid Finder I think we learned a lot and we&apos;ll be taking feedback to future raids. Overall though we&apos;ve found Raid Finder to be very successful, the amount of people able to experience the content is huge, the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and we hope to only continue forward with that momentum.

Druid Gear in Shapshifted Forms<br>
Just coming back to this briefly; There are some big technical limitations preventing us from allowing gear to show on Feral/Moonkin druid forms, and currently we have no immediate plans of working to overcome them. However, we could potentially start with something like the shoulders. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/209794-druid-gear-should-show-in-some-way-in-feral-forms/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3061867041?page=1#9))<br>

Four Specs for Other Classes?<br>
I just wanted to pop in and say that the reason that we gave a fourth spec to druids was simply because it always felt as though they had four specs, but two of them were built into the one tree. This change was made to make the tank spec into a tree of its own instead of in a tree with their DPS build.<br>
<br>
At this current point, we do not plan to implement a fourth spec for other classes because no other class feels like it has four specializations already. You can always be hopeful that this could change, but for now we appreciate the awesome feedback that you have given [...] (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/209788-a-new-paladin-dps-specc-vanguard/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3061859970?page=2#29))</div></div>
