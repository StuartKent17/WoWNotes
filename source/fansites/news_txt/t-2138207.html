Achievement - The Rat Pack<br>
The Rat Pack (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11431-the-rat-pack) has proven challenging to figure out, but Tzhaa (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/935642-Tzhaa) and other group members have done it!<br>
<br>
<br>
There are several rats that spawn between between Curator and Shade of Medivh<br>
These rats are lootable and will give you a Rodent of Usual Size (http://www.wowdb.com/items/143664-rodent-of-usual-size)<br>
Once you have mounted the rat, you can defeat the Mana Devourer and will earn the achievement!<br>
