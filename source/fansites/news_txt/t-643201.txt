Boubouille2009-04-13, 04:32 PMPatch 3.1 - Compiled PvE Loot List
The old Ulduar Loot Summary http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=853 page has been removed from the menu and replaced with the Compiled PvE Loot List http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=861. This list include:

All the items discovered in Ulduar during the PTR testing
Emblems of Conquest http://ptr.wowhead.com/?item=45624 Rewards
Items crafted from plans dropped in Ulduar
Argent Tournament Rewards

About 30 items have been added to the Ulduar loot list since the last update, the Ulduar-only lists will be available again very shortly.
