Raid Finder Highmaul - Arcane Sanctum Bosses Missing Loot
We wanted to let you know that we are aware of reports that neither Tectus nor Ko'ragh are dropping loot in the second wing of Highmaul. We are currently looking into those reports and hope to have the issue resolved as quickly as possible.

We're monitoring the situation and will provide details as they become available. 

Update
It looks like we were able to implement a resolution for the issue that should allow any new instances of the raid to function correctly. Going forward bosses will drop loot normally.

We are looking into possible resolutions for those impacted by the issue prior to the fix and will provide an update as soon as we know more. 

Update 2 12/17 6:30 pm
We had hoped that we would be able to implement a resolution to those impacted by the earlier boss loot issue so that additional contact would not be necessary but unfortunately it seems that will not be possible.

If you killed the first and/or third boss in the Arcane Sanctum 2nd Wing of Highmaul this morning and did not receive any loot, neither gold nor items, please submit a ticket though our Support Site  and our In-Game Support staff will work to address the issue.

Thank you all for your patience.

The satchel will remain Bind on Account and we'll continue to monitor Dungeon Finder queues and iterate as needed to ensure a great experience for everyone.
