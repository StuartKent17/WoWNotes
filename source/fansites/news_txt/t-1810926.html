Flying Patch Delay<br>
I agree with OP flying is just flipping a switch. all the BS about this and that is just them stretching out the fact they don&apos;t want people flying around tannan and just blowing thru the content in 24 hours.<br>
It&apos;s a compelling narrative for the cynical among us, but it&apos;s simply not true. We gain nothing by trying to be intentionally deceptive in the way we design and release content. I wish more people could understand that, even when they disagree with some of our design decisions.<br>
<br>
think of it like the Belf and goat zones. you can fly in BC but sot these areas because the building don&apos;t have finished tops. in WoD all the building are finished and the feather shoots you up max height before starting the fall. its not exactly flying but it shows that everything is finished. also its not like the land is coded in a different way from the rest of the game that would make flying difficult.<br>
That doesn&apos;t mean every inch of the terrain is bug free and there are no invisible walls in certain locations. People who have gotten really creative with the feather and glider can attest to this. While Draenor wasn&apos;t built with 2D backdrops and such for buildings, the way some areas in vanilla WoW were built, that doesn&apos;t mean a simple toggle will allow everyone to fly anywhere they want without running into any issues.<br>
<br>
We weren&apos;t sure at the outset of designing Draenor whether or not flying would be enabled at some point, but that doesn&apos;t mean every art and design team ensured from day one that every bit of the world was designed with flying in mind. WoW is a very big game with a lot of programming under the hood. Changes need to be made and testing needs to be done before characters are able to explore everywhere from the skies.<br>
<br>
Any small bug or environment quirk could lead to any number of issues that we want to make sure are addressed before we flip &quot;the toggle.&quot; In other words, there is no toggle.<br>
<br>
I imagine its not so much unlocking flight for that character as much as it is coding it to unlock for all of your 90+ characters on your account and making sure that aspect works correctly that&apos;s cause them to delay it to a patch after 6.2 rather than in it.<br>
This is also correct. It&apos;s not just about the environment, but also the systems in place to make sure flying is appropriately rewarded to each character based on the criteria.

Salty Crew - Garrison Ability<br>
The Salty Crew (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/abilities/274-salty-crew) ship modifier was tested in the public test realm, but was not added to the game with patch 6.2.<br>
<br>
Is there anyway to counter &quot;Expert Captain&quot;?<br>
Yes. Use ships that have modifiers that increase success chance (Undead Crew (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/abilities/293-undead-crew), Human Crew (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/abilities/292-human-crew), Pandaren Crew (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/abilities/294-pandaren-crew) if it&apos;s a long mission), or sail under a buff like Air Superiority (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/abilities/318-air-superiority), or combine ships that modify each other. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/379211-salty-crew-garrison-ability/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18300180296?page=1#8))<br>

Naval Mission Changes<br>
We didn&apos;t nerf the building. Its effectiveness remains unchanged. We DID nerf many of the naval mission times and buffed the rewards.<br>
<br>
All of this should be relatively good news as far as shipyards are concerned.<br>
<br>
What about instances of the Mission Completion Orders drastically increasing the time to complete existing naval missions? I applied a few completion orders about an hour ago, and they added anywhere between 5 and 18 hours to the missions they were used on.<br>
<br>
Normally I wouldn&apos;t be fussing about something like this, but this pushes back my ability to continue the Legendary quest chain by another day.<br>
For anyone who wasted Mission Completion Orders while this hotfix was applied, wherein the order didn&apos;t work as intended by instantly completing the mission, you can contact Customer Support and request a refund of the item.<br>
<br>
So. The fix doesn&apos;t seem to affect missions already in progress which means the better part of my fleet will still be gone for three days.<br>
That&apos;s something we couldn&apos;t really make happen via hotfix for in-progress missions. Sorry. <br>
<br>
Edit: However, any gold and Apexis Crystal rewards for those in-progress missions should properly be increased when the missions are completed.<br>
<br>
And how do I go about doing that? Call them? Send an in-game ticket?<br>
Yea, open up an in-game ticket and let them know that your Mission Completion Order didn&apos;t work as a result of the hotfix to naval missions today, and that you were instructed by a community manager on the forums to request to have that item restored for you.<br>
<br>
This added the original duration of a mission to my remaining time. A two day mission with 11 hours left, now has 2 days and 11 hours remaining. Thanks.<br>
It&apos;s absolutely an unfortunate bug that came out of applying this hotfix, and for that we apologize. Going forward though this change will be very helpful.<br>
<br>
This is nice but the issue isn&apos;t really the item itself. It is the time lost. Unless the item is refunded almost immediately (opening a ticket will probably take longer than the mission anyway) and will work on the affected missions it doesn&apos;t really help anything. You are still out 2-3 days on your ships because of this bug.<br>
I&apos;ve been told Customer Support is unable to reset the mission for you. Getting the item back to use again on another mission still has some value. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/379193-did-theydid-they-nerf-mission-completion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18300170255?page=2#38))<br>
<br>
Rated Battleground Rewards<br>
We&apos;ve isolated the issue and have a working fix. However, due to the nature of the bug itself, the fix will not take effect until our next maintenance period.<br>
<br>
To provide some additional detail on the fix: we&apos;ve had to slightly restructure how the box is awarded. Once the fix is in place, you&apos;ll be automatically given a quest to win three Rated Battlegrounds when you enter one (unless you already have the quest, or have already completed it, of course).<br>
<br>
This also has the benefit of making the process a lot more transparent to the player, so you can know for certain once the fix is live: if you&apos;re not getting the quest, it hasn&apos;t been fixed yet. You will need to make sure you have space in your quest log to receive the quest.

Any chance on letting queuing in raids back in for Ashran? Was a fun experience w/group finder, sad to see them go.<br>
No because it caused a litany of problems. I&apos;ll try to elaborate in a future forum post. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/614075409563410432))<br>

Lore<br>
What is twilight magic? Is it a branch of Fel magic?<br>
Old god magic, void I think? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613961991162564608))<br>
<br>
Isn&apos;t fel magic chaos and chaos kinda combines all schools?<br>
Void and Fel are definitely different things. Entropy vs. absolute 0. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613967868070350848))<br>
Doesn&apos;t fel energy combine all types of energies since it&apos;s chaos magic? The chaos school in-game combines all schools.<br>
In the editor, yes. Lore-wise? Up in the air. May be further defined in the future. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613970368022380544))<br>
<br>
term used interchangeably with life energy and life essence, as a power source. A source states blood (which was called life<br>
IMO, not really. Life uses life energy, emerald dream stuff. Fel uses souls as energy, erasing them from existence. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613971643464032256))<br>
IMO Imagine you believe in heaven, and you go there, and then suddenly you are wrenched back to Azeroth, and consumed for fuel. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613971816298713088))<br>
Then, neverending blackness. And Sargeras calls to you. Do you want to end this? Serve him. Eternally. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613972039007895552))<br>
Just my opinion though (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613972209435021312))<br>
<br>
Fel magic is a form of life magic.<br>
There is a difference between using the elements in harmony (shaman) and using them through force (twilight) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613972364230049793))<br>
<br>
Using souls and harmonizing with the life energy of Azeroth are polar opposites. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613972670313578496))<br>
Souls are undead and if warlocks drain and channel souls against their will wouldn&apos;t that make them necromancers?<br>
Controlling demons is one thing, understanding Dreadlord rezzing magic and undead is entirely another area of study. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613973540493201408))<br>
But doesn&apos;t necromancy extend to controlling souls/spirits/ghosts?<br>
Draining a soul and rezzing it are not the same. Death Knights use a different branch of magic than you. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613974191000432640))<br>
But if you are draining and channeling a soul against its will and souls are undead aren&apos;t you controlling undead, thus performing<br>
You&apos;re not controlling it, you&apos;re stealing it. You can enslave demon, you can&apos;t enslave undead. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613975337626677248))<br>
Draining a soul and channeling it like a puppet is basically the same as controlling a soul lol<br>
Similar schools, different magical academies. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613976714495062016))<br>

Road to BlizzCon: WoW North American Arena Qualifiers<br>
If you are looking for more arena action, take a look at ESL&apos;s new tournaments (http://play.eslgaming.com/worldofwarcraft/europe/news/256301). <br>
The march down the road to BlizzCon 2015 is about to commence! Arena teams across North America can now sign up for the online North American Qualifiers and fight to become one of six teams that will continue on to the North American Regionals later this year. There, they&#x2019;ll battle against one team from Latin America and one team from Australia &amp; New Zealand (http://wowarena2015.aclpro.com.au/) to find out who&#x2019;s heading to the World Championships at BlizzCon 2015.<br>
<br>
Schedule<br>
Teams will have the opportunity to compete for their place at the NA Regionals over three online cups, produced in partnership with GCDTV (http://twitch.tv/gcdtv):<br>
<br>
Cup 1: July 14 &#x2013; July 18 (one team qualifies)<br>
Cup 2: July 28 &#x2013; August 1 (two teams qualify)<br>
Cup 3: August 11 &#x2013; August 15 (three teams qualify)<br>
<br>
<br>
These cups will use a single-elimination tournament structure. Matches will be best of 3 up until the semifinals, which will be best of 5, with a best of 7 series at the finals. Because of this, we highly encourage teams to make use of the 4-player team roster (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/19803852/the-road-to-blizzcon-2015-wow-arena-world-championship-6-19-2015) we&#x2019;re allowing in this year&#x2019;s tournament, to allow for some extra flexibility in their team&#x2019;s class composition.<br>
<br>
Brackets will be seeded according to the average Arena Ladder rating (CR) of the three highest-rated players on the team&#x2019;s roster. Teams who qualify for the North American Regionals will not be allowed to compete again in the online NA Qualifiers. Teams who do not qualify may continue to compete in any remaining cups.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll have more details on these qualifier cups&#x2014;including when you&#x2019;ll be able to watch the action live on Twitch.tv/WoW (http://twitch.tv/wow)&#x2014;in the coming weeks.<br>
<br>
Rules<br>
Below, you&#x2019;ll find links to everything you need to know to compete, including official rules and sign-up instructions, so please read everything carefully before you get started.<br>
<br>
One notable addition this year is the Macro and Script Whitelist. To help ensure that everyone is on an even playing field, we&#x2019;ve assembled a list of macros and scripts that we&#x2019;ve determined are acceptable for players to use in our in-person events, starting with the Regionals through BlizzCon itself. Anything not listed will be disallowed from use during these live competitions.<br>
<br>
This restriction will not be in place for the online NA Qualifier cups, but we wanted to present it now to make sure teams have time to prepare. If you feel a vital macro or script has been omitted from the list, you can submit it for consideration by emailing eSportsTeam@blizzard.com (be sure to include &#x201C;WoW&#x201D; in the subject line).<br>

Eligibility<br>
In order for an Arena team to be able to compete in the North American Qualifiers, they must fulfill some basic eligibility requirements:<br>
<br>
<br>
The average Arena Ladder rating of the three highest-rated players on the team&#x2019;s roster must be at least 2000 by July 9th, 2015 to be eligible for Online Cup 1.<br>
<br>
This rating requirement will be updated for subsequent cups.<br>
<br>
All players must have appropriate residency:<br>
<br>
Must be from an eligible country (see the complete legal rules (https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_folder_media/86/869ASW2O63WJ1435708734745.pdf))<br>
Must not be excluded by local law<br>
<br>
See below for complete details on proof of residency verification<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: Although players from Australia/New Zealand and some Latin American countries are eligible to compete in the North American Arena Qualifiers, we encourage those players to consider competing at their respective regional qualifiers instead. Players who compete in the Australia &amp; New Zealand or Latin American qualifiers will not be eligible to compete in the NA qualifiers, and vice versa.<br>
