Boubouille2011-06-10, 11:15 PMUpdate - Zarhym clarified who the "Molten Lords" required to start the legendary questline are.
Molten Lords are mobs in the Firelands. Killing one will unlock the quest for you, after which you need to visit Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar or the Wizard's Sanctum in Stormwind to pick up the quest.

You do not have to have defeated any bosses from the previous tier. That was a requirement we ultimately decided to get rid of.

For more information, check the preview posted a couple of weeks ago!

General
New Quest Chain: Elemental Bonds

A New quest line is now available to level-85 Horde and Alliance characters, bringing brave adventurers to Thrall's aid. The Call of the World-Shaman, the quest which will point players toward Thrall and The Nordrassil Summit, can be obtained in Stormwind or Orgrimmar. 


New Raid: The Firelands

Battle-hardened veterans of the Horde and Alliance now have an opportunity to strike at Ragnaros the Firelord and his loyal servants by venturing into their domain via Sulfuron Spire in Mount Hyjal.


New Legendary Item: Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest

Steadfast raiders have an opportunity to embark on a series of quests to create an all-new legendary caster staff. In order to begin the process of assembling the staff, players must first kill a Molten Lord in the Firelands. Once a Molten Lord is killed, players can accept the quest A Legendary Engagement from Ziradormi or Coridormi in Orgrimmar or Stormwind.


New User Interface Feature: Dungeon Journal

A host of dungeon information is now built into the user interface via the all-new Dungeon Journal. This feature can be accessed via a new button in the Navigation tray from anywhere in the world. Boss background story, encounter details, abilities, and loot can be viewed with the Dungeon Journal for all bosses which have been integrated into the new system this includes bosses for all Cataclysm dungeons and raids. Additional dungeons are planned to be incorporated in future updates.


Dungeons & Raids

Raid Profiles have been added which allow players to save the raid window user interface layout based on type of content i.e. 10-player raids, 25-player raids, Battlegrounds, etc. for future use. 

Players can select PvE, PvP, specialization, and group size. Each Raid Profile type will then automatically setup going forward. 
The pullout panel will be available for 5-player content as well when Show Raid Frames is selected. 
Raid Profiles can list groups horizontally as well as vertically. 

A Raid button has been added to the Navigation tray which will bring players straight to the Raid window in the Social pane. 


Valor Points 

The maximum number of Valor Points which can be earned in a week from any and all applicable dungeons and raids is now 980, down from 1250. 
The maximum number of Valor Points awarded for completing Rise of the Zandalari dungeons remains at 980.
The maximum number of Valor Points awarded for completing Heroic dungeons remains at 490.
The number of Valor Points awarded for killing a boss in the Firelands is 70 in 10-player mode, and 90 in 25-player mode.
The number of Valor Points awarded for killing Occu'thar in Baradin Hold is 35 in 10-player mode, and 45 in 25-player mode.
The number of Valor Points awarded for killing a boss on Heroic difficulty in The Bastion of Twilight, Blackwing Descent, and Throne of the Four winds is 35 in 10-player mode, and 45 in 25-player mode.


Baradin Hold 

Occu'thar has broken free from his cage and presents an all-new boss challenge to players in 10- and 25-player arrangements who control Tol Barad.


PvP
Battlegrounds

New PvP ground mounts, the Vicious War Wolf Horde and Vicious War Steed Alliance, will be awarded to players for completing achievements to win 75, 150, and 300 Rated Battlegrounds respectively, rather than for being in the top .5% of the ladder at the end of each season as with Arenas. This award system is to better compliment the spirit of Battlegrounds. One account-bound mount will be awarded for each achievement unlocked, allowing players who obtain 150 and 300 Rated Battleground wins to earn this mount a second and third time. The additional mounts earned can then be sent to alt characters, given they’re account-bound. These mounts are awarded as soon as an associated achievement is unlocked and do not correspond with end-of-season rewards.
The individual Matchmaking Rating column has been removed from the Rated Battleground scoreboard and replaced with a team Matchmaking Rating.


War Games

Many improvements have been made to the War Games interface. It now has its own panel for ease of use and raid/group leaders are the only ones who can challenge another group to War Games.

Feral

Druids now gain 1 attack power per point of Strength, down from 2. They continue to gain 2 attack power per point of Agility while in Cat Form or Bear Form. In addition, Cat Form’s scaling rate from gear upgrades was slower than other classes, which was causing them to fall behind in damage with higher item levels. To counter the Strength change and improve scaling, the following changes have been made. All numbers cited are for level-85 druids.

Mangle Cat damage at level 80 and above has been increased to 530% 540% weapon damage, up from 460%, and bonus damage has been lowered to 302.
Rake initial damage on hit now deals the same damage as each periodic tick and is treated the same for all combat calculations. Periodic damage now gains 14.7% of attack power per tick, up from 12.6%, and base damage per tick has been lowered from 557 to 56. There is a known issue with Rake’s tooltip being incorrect from this change will be corrected in a future patch.
Ravage damage at level 80 and above has been increased to 975% 950% weapon damage, up from 850%, and bonus damage has been lowered to 532.
Savage Roar now grants 80% increased damage to melee auto attacks, up from 50%. The Glyph of Savage Roar remains an unchanged bonus of 5% to that total.
Shred damage at level 80 and above has been increased to 520% 540% weapon damage, up from 450%, and bonus damage has been lowered to 302.



Balance

Starfire damage has been increased by approximately 23%.
Wrath damage has been increased by approximately 23%.


Set Bonuses

The 4-piece Balance druid tier 11 PvE set bonus, Astral Alignment, now provides a total of 15% critical strike chance with 3 charges, decreasing by 5% per charge, instead of 99% decreasing by 33% per charge. This change was made because the set bonus proved so valuable it was not possible to upgrade out of the set into tier 12. To compensate, changes have been made to Starfire and Wrath listed at the top of the druid class section.
