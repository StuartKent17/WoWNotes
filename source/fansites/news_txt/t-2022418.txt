Legion Beta Build Deploy - 7/5/2016
Hi Friends,

Beta realms are being brought down for another new build. ETA is 1-3 hours, if it ends up going long I'll provide updates.

As usual I'll leave this thread open for discussion so long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines. 

Thanks for your patience everyone!
