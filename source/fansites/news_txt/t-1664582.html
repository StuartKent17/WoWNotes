MMO-Champion Forums Moderator Recruitment<br>
Good news everyone! We&apos;re recruiting moderators for the forums again! The amount of users and posts keeps increasing and we reached the point where we need some help before the trolls take over and play Whack-a-Mod in the Darkmoon Faire. I know it sounds fun, but I&apos;m going to assume we don&apos;t want that. <br>
<br>
Please be sure to read the entire post before applying!<br>
