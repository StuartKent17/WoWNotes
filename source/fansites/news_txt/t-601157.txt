Magtheridon got nerfed too. Didn't take long.

The Magtheridon encounter has been rebalanced to be somewhat easier and should now better keep to proper raid progression.

Yup, nerfs are everywhere tonight.

Gruul's health has been lowered, and the damage from his shatter ability has been reduced.

Grull should now correctly use his hurtful strike ability.

Karazhan got its share too.

Nightbane's melee damage has been reduced.
Nightbane's breath attack and rain of bones now target those players attempting to avoid his attacks.
The Romulo and Julianne encounter has been retuned to be less difficult.

Also a note about Magtheridon


We still plan to look into improving the Magtheridon encounter, but no adjustments have been put into motion yet.

As a reminder, Hydross got nerfed too

Hydross the Unstable no longer deals a crushing blow.
