Warlords of Draenor - The Everbloom<br>
Today we are taking a look at The Everbloom, a dungeon located mostly in Gorgrond with the final boss near Stormwind. You can see the Stormwind area (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4173-Priest-Tier-17-Armor-Sets-New-Area-in-Stormwind-Blue-Posts-Curse-of-Naxxramas) in the outside world as well.<br>

Warlords of Draenor - Dwarf Male Faces<br>
The latest beta build also added some more variation to Dwarf Male faces. It appears we got a snapshot of work in progress, as the faces in this build are somewhere between the old and new faces from the Artcraft example (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/august/facesInProgress.jpg).<br>

Warlords of Draenor - Troll Artcraft<br>
We might see the Troll Artcraft this week, as this is the week after referenced in the tweet.<br>

Right now resolve seems to be a lot weaker than vengeance in terms of healing, is that cause of the gear or is it intentional?<br>
Intentional. Tanks were way too self-sustainable in Mists. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495006799884341248))<br>
<br>
Ok cool, I&apos;m a fan of changes. On another note, will we see icon update to old abilities? Some seem outdated compared to new one<br>
Unlikely. Changing icons on people can be really jarring. Example: The icon for Presence of Mind (mage spell to make your next... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496002090087370752))<br>
...spell instant cast) has been an icon of a plate helmet, since launch. That makes *no* sense whatesoever. We tried changing it... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496002248447496192))<br>
...to this in Mists beta, and everyone was furious, despite being objectively more sensical. http://t.co/SBX5wWmkx2 (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496002693580611584))<br>

Breath of Sindragosa should not have a 1min cd. It should be like Conversion (toggled on/off as desired for RP dump). #WoD<br>
Do you want to lose the pooling gameplay that it creates? Is that just too much complication? It&apos;s supposed to be complicated one (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494994192221757440))<br>
And does that not just devolve it into being your sole RP dump? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494994436175044608))<br>
i guess it could be considered a &apos;big CD&apos;, but the dmg output needs to be much higher.<br>
Dmg output is intended that it&apos;s a single target gain. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495006384031662082))<br>
<br>
&quot;Dual-Wielders favor blasting their foes with frost damage&quot;. Does this mean that DW is gonna use HB outside Rime too?<br>
Absolutely. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495343986060443648))<br>
<br>
I thought Rune of Cinderglacier was going to be the new thing in WoD. Why was it removed? Just sticking to boring RFC again?<br>
Yeah, we tried it out and found that it wasn&apos;t compelling at all, just added complication. FC did what we wanted it to do. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495384117937065984))<br>
<br>
With cinderglacier out of the picture, is the intent still for frost to use different runeforges? Ie 2x razorice vs FC+RI<br>
FC+RI. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495616772100194304))<br>
<br>
Wouldn&apos;t you agree that it&apos;d be better to put Obliterate on Frost&apos;s Mastery instead of buffing it&apos;s damage outright?<br>
No, that would not achieve the intended rotations. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495643695623184386))<br>
I just want to make sure I got this right. So as 2H we want to stall KM to use it on Obliterate? Make us care about KM again?<br>
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495649919899025408))<br>

Just wondering, is Sunfall and Insect swarm still coming for moonkins or are the current abilities set in stone?<br>
Sunfall is available via a glyph. Insect Swarm is not coming. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495011480681447424))<br>
<br>
Does Astral Communion work with haste? Cast time gets lower and the bar moves quicker? Or is it considered a channel spell?<br>
It does get shorted with haste (consistent with all channels), but that doesn&apos;t matter since it&apos;s spammable. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495741357973983232))<br>

Have you thought about let Hunter pet Birds fly while the Huinter is flying liek flyable companions can already?<br>
This would involve some tech work, not likely for WoD launch but it&apos;s on my wishlist. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/495242452073472000))<br>
<br>
how will the SV rotation work? Will we want to pool focus above a certain number? Is there still an ICD on lock and load?<br>
No ICD on LnL. You may want to pool in order to burst. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495384308563984385))<br>
<br>
Quick MM question. Any chance Sniper Training will have a quicker activation while the ticking buff is active?<br>
Nope. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495633723451125760))<br>

multistrike doesn&apos;t proc of icicle intended or bug?<br>
That&apos;s not true. Multistrikes can Icicle, but Icicles cannot Multistrike. It fully benefits once, but doesn&apos;t get to double-dip. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494994864975527939))<br>
<br>
Will Mirror Image snapshot the mage&apos;s SP in WoD or change dynamically over duration?<br>
Dynamic. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495987419313741825))<br>

Any plans to make seal swapping feel less punishing (forsaking a gcd for each buff)? Making a swap generate 1HP maybe?<br>
The talent is meant to be more difficult to use but offer added benefits. It&apos;s a talent built around seal-swapping. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495334094629109760))<br>
<br>
But you are fine with Paladin Seal dancing?<br>
For a talent that specifically does that, and just that? Yes. Or for AoE vs single target? Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495625459338465280))<br>

With the recent change to tremor, could we see an increase to totem health made baseline to offset? Even a critter could kill em<br>
That&apos;s what the glyph is for. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495622894622240768))<br>
<br>
Why did you make Flame Shock spreads only do base damage? Defeats the purpose of Fusion talent and Unleash Flame snapshoting.<br>
It definitely does not defeat the purpose of either of those things. It&apos;s a limit on their power. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495633079969394689))<br>

Any Sudden Death tweaks inc? Eg: double proc chance but executes only deal half the damage of a regular execute?<br>
Executes from Sudden Death won&apos;t use additional rage. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495703041819959297))<br>

How are things looking for the quivers etc that were in the customization artcraft?<br>
awesome, we&apos;ve built some of the models. No eta for seeing them in-game but we&apos;ll probably update in Artcraft periodically (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/495772918677504000))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
i find it awkward after leveling to 100 that im still wearing legendary cloak and a few pieces of raid gear from SoO<br>
The alternative is &quot;I replaced my hard-earned legendary with a quest green, thanks Bliz.&quot; Dungeon gear should beat all of that. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/495046610649243648))<br>
<br>
Do tier pieces change from spec to spec with repecs (including set bonuses) similar to other head/shoulders/chest/gloves/legs?<br>
Set bonuses change between specs. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495300902656282624))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Since heroic and mythic don&apos;t share lockout, does this mean you can do mythic same week as heroic highmaul becomes available?<br>
Mythic will be locked for an additional week, so you cannot. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/495045585502617600))<br>
<br>
I didn&apos;t care for that design, personally, but oh, well.<br>
Curious - what about it? Worth noting that in retrospect we feel HoF came too soon; most weren&apos;t done with MSV. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/495282692968046592))<br>
wouldn&apos;t a simple attunement(IE kill end boss) to enter the next raid instance solve these issues?<br>
But also psychology of &quot;aaaaa I&apos;m behind, there&apos;s another raid? I&apos;m not even done with the last one!&quot; (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/495326391420723200))<br>
<br>
Curious, Why aren&apos;t you planning to give us the old raid soloable buff for MoP raids/dungeons? Wont they be impossible at 100?<br>
No, your damage and damage reduction are much stronger against significantly lower level opponents in Warlords. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495631341619122176))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Are there still new BG&apos;s planned for warlords? We haven&apos;t heard anything about them since Blizzcon.<br>
For expansion release, our efforts are focused on Ashran. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495049110873849859))<br>
<br>
IIRC there was talk about making new &quot;War&quot; category for BGs with Wingergrasp, AV, etc. (or new BGs like them). Still on table?<br>
We like the idea but not a high priority right now. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495225191346479104))<br>
<br>
Will unobtainable Wotlk pvp gear be available for transmog in WoD?<br>
.All previous seasons should be available on beta. If you find something is missing, let us know. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495225588542894080))<br>
which vendors would I find them at? And does that include the old weapons too?<br>
Includes weapons. Should be Netherstorm/Tanaris right ? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495227097414385664))<br>
<br>
Vehicles yes. But why not destructible buildings (using dynamite, etc)? Destroy a bridge, force a change of assault approach e.g.<br>
We didn&apos;t want Ashran to be about siege and fortress warfare. We wanted it to be about exploration and world pvp. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495332145460547584))<br>
<br>
have you guys ever considered allowing players to transfer CP to alts? i have 22.6k on my main, and my alt has a 22k cap<br>
No, we greatly dislike the idea of simply transferring Honor/Conquest from one character to another. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495333604965101569))<br>
<br>
Why is rated arena being disabled for twinks?I know we are the minority,but how does taking rated from us benefit lvl100s<br>
Without a good sized population the rating system is easily exploited. It was never intended for low levels. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495224813561331712))<br>
Getting rid of arenas for levels under 100 = Lots of twinks will quit wow = less people paying for wow = dead game<br>
Low level players can still do arenas using skirmishes, but they will not receive a rating or achievements. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495392783419453440))<br>
But low levels do it for the ratings so they can boast about it Why not give us rating but no chievements?<br>
At that population level, ratings are easily exploited and pretty much meaningless. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495393335796715522))<br>
It means something to the people that like to brag about rating <br>
They can do it at max level. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495394585175003137))<br>
Well you&apos;ve just made a lot of twinkers angry, lots of them are quitting so rip subscribers in WoD.<br>
Definitely willing to hear complaints, but unsub threats are not effective feedback. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495397225535528960))<br>
We&apos;re still providing the ability to do arenas, but a rating system at that level with so few people is broken (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495397469899870208))<br>

Reputation / Questing<br>
If my friend and I build different buildings at our outposts in each zone, can we still quest together<br>
Yes, it will only cause minor changes in most zones (1 quest line maybe). Gorgrond is an exception. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/495334733451374592))<br>
However, in Gorgrond, you&apos;ll get bonus objectives in the areas for which you don&apos;t have quests. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/495334899055067136))<br>
