Boubouille2009-04-06, 12:06 PMPatch 3.1 Companion Pets
A few pets will be added with the upcoming patch, most of them are from the Argent Tournament and a few were added for holiday events. The good news about the Argent Tournament pets is that all the pets you can buy for 40 x 
Champion's Seal  Sen'jin Fetish , Elwynn Lamb , etc ... are NOT bind on pick up, which means that you will be able to sell them at the AH and get the pets from the other faction at the neutral AH as well. 

Keep in mind that this is from the TEST realms and it could be changed before the live release.

Naxxramas Speed Runs
The Sartharion speed-run video  was quite popular and I got a few mails about it, now is the time for 2 Naxxramas speed run! The first one is from Loke's List  EU-Mazrigos, these guys managed to clear Naxxramas-25 in ... 1 hour and 12 minutes. 

Even if Naxxramas isn't really hard in Wrath of the Lich King, it's always impressive to see 15 bosses and their trash killed in such a short amount of time. That's a boss every 5 minute

The 2nd speed-run is a from Showdown  EU-Vek'nilash and shows them cleaning the Naxxramas-10 instance in 59 minutes and 27 seconds. One boss every 4 minute!

The growing interest in speed-runs could be a good thing, even if we probably won't see as many of them after the release of Ulduar. I'm not really sure we could turn that into a competition though, logs and videos are easily edited and it would become a problem when people start fighting for a few seconds to get a world record ... but it definitely would be interesting to see it tracked in-game as part of the Achievements statistics.
