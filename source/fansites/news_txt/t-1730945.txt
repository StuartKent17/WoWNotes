Patch 6.1 - Legendary Quests
Patch 6.1 added several new legendary quests to lead up to the cinematic above. There are several spoilers in the quest text, so check the quest pages to see it. 

The Final Assault  is the final quest that asks us to wait for Patch 6.2: 

Prepare your garrison and await further instructions from Archmage Khadgar. [Coming in Patch 6.2!]

Our campaign in Draenor has taken an unexpected turn. With Gul'dan assuming power over the Iron Horde, history is poised to repeat itself - our world is in more peril than ever.

It's time to bring the full might of your garrison to bear against Tanaan Jungle. Marshal your forces, <name>, and for my part I will research ways to counter Gul'dan's magic.

I will be in contact with you soon.

Patch 6.1.2 PTR Patch Notes
Patch 6.1.2 is now available for testing on the Public Test Realms PTR! Participating on the Public Test Realms lets you test patches before it has been released on live realms. If you'd like to help test and provide feedback, you can start by copying your character and downloading the PTR client. Once you've had a chance to try things out, visit our PTR Discussion 6.1.2 forum to discuss the patch. To report issues or errors, use the in-game Submit Bug feature found under Game Menu -> Help -> Submit Bug or by visiting the PTR Bug Report 6.1.2 forum.

Introducing the WoW Token
Coming soon to an Azeroth near you: the WoW Token, a new in-game item that allows players to simply and securely exchange gold and game time between each other.

Players will be able to purchase a WoW Token through the in-game Shop for real money, and then sell it on the Auction House for gold at the current market price. When a player buys a WoW Token from the Auction House for gold, the Token becomes Soulbound, and the player can then redeem it for 30 days of game time.


The WoW Token feature will be enabled at a future date. Patch 6.1.2 adds in the framework needed for the WoW Token feature in the game client and is not active at this time. In the meantime, check out this FAQ  for details on how the feature works.

New World of Warcraft Comic: Blood and Thunder
Fenris Wolfbrother’s bravery and strength is matched only by his desire to prove himself a capable warrior at any cost. While his father Garad, chieftain of the Frostwolves, warns Fenris of the perils of putting one’s own whims before the needs of the family, the neighboring Thunderlord clan hunts and slays the dangerous Gronn without restriction or remorse.

Envious of the Thunderlord and dismissive of his father’s teachings, Fenris begins a double life. During the day, he will be a tame, obedient Frostwolf… at night, under a different name, he becomes something else entirely.

But Fenris must still bear responsibility for both his actions and those of the “Iron Wolf.”


  

We invite you to read and download  the free comic, “Blood and Thunder ,” written by Raphael Ahad and illustrated by Alex Horley.
