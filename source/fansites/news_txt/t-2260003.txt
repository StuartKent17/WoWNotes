Obtain 300 toys and you’ll receive the Mechanized Lumber Extractor http://www.wowdb.com/items/140500-mechanized-lumber-extractor mount, which is very similar to the Sky Golem http://www.wowdb.com/spells/134359-sky-golem.

Kalytha’s Haunted Locket http://www.wowdb.com/items/68806-kalythas-haunted-locket
