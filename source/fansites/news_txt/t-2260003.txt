Toy Box - Spooky Toys
Today we are taking a look at three different spooky toys and how to obtain them. Obtain 300 toys and you’ll receive the Mechanized Lumber Extractor  mount, which is very similar to the Sky Golem 

Kalytha’s Haunted Locket 
If you’re interested in playing as a ghostly female night elf, Kalytha's Haunted Locket  is for you!


Features a 30 minute duration and only a 15 minute cooldown, making it one of the few toys that will allow you to chain transformations and stay disguised for as long as you’d like!
Transformation isn’t broken by combat or mounting, and your character can still show off its awesome Artifact appearance.


As long as you have the Flight Master’s License , obtaining Kalytha’s Haunted Locket is quite simple!


Head out to Azshara  and find Tex Vortacoil , a goblin vendor located inside Archmage Xylem’s tower.
He'll sell you Kalytha's Haunted Locket  for 5,000 gold.



      


Death’s Door Charm 
If you’d rather be a ghostly version of your own character’s appearance, the Death's Door Charm  is the perfect choice.


This transformation has a 30 minute duration, and the Charm’s cooldown is 1 hour.
Requires Revered reputation with Legion’s Valarjar faction.
Once Revered, simply head over to Valdemar Stormseeker , the Valarjar Emissary located at Valdisdall in Stormheim  to purchase the Charm for 425 gold.



  


Haunting Memento 
If you’re in the market for something a bit more unpredictable, the Haunting Memento  is a fun little toy that can be used to “haunt” yourself or another player. 


The Haunting Memento  can be purchased from Chester  on Darkmoon Island  at a cost of 90 Darkmoon Prize Ticket 
Every three minutes, the afflicted player will fall victim to a haunting effect.
There are over ten different Haunted effects, including:

The sky turns into a ghostly blue stream of souls
The player is swarmed by giant spiders
The player is transformed into a skeleton or hideous beast
