Earlier today VANQUISH (http://www.vqguild.net/) (US-Cho&apos;gall) killed XT-002 in Hard Mode. As announced earlier today the achievement was nerfed in patch 3.1.2 (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/17222905211-ulduar-tuning-may-19-2009.html) and I&apos;d rather not call it world first to start another discussion on US/EU servers getting patched first/last. (Note: Still a world first, technically)<br>

Extra Champion&apos;s Seals in 3.1.2<br>
Small update on the Argent Tournament rewards, the Champion&apos;s Purse (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45724) now has a chance to drop a Champion&apos;s Seal (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44990). It will probably help you get your Argent Hippogryph (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzyHw7bt37k) faster, especially with the lowered price (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17163477135-argent-hippogryph-cost-update.html).<br>

Nitro Boots Shut Down in Arena<br>
After several attempts to balance the Nitro Boots ability in the arena, we have decided that we currently do not have an acceptable solution. Until we are able to better balance this ability it has been shut down in the arenas. We fully plan to continue working on this item and we intend to adjust it in upcoming patches. <br>
<br>
We have plans to make certain that this item is still worth the investment made in it. So don&apos;t vendor it just yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/15/17223045345-nitro-boots-shut-down-in-arena.html))<br>

Buffs to Fury and Arms<br>
We do have buffs planned for Arms and Fury. We&apos;ll announce them when they are a little closer to going live. I don&apos;t want to oversell them because players sometimes get notions of seeing their dps go up by 25%.<br>
<br>
It&apos;s also entirely possible dps buffs might come with PvP nerfs. Warrior representation in Arena went from very low to very high. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17223174426-fury-a-simple-fix.html))<br>

Arms and Fury in PvE/PVP<br>
I should have found the original quote, but someone above thought that I was saying we needed to nerf Fury for PvP. We&apos;re not worried that Fury is overpowered in PvP. We are worried that Arms might be overpowered in PvP.<br>
<br>
Arms PvE -- dps too low<br>
Fury PvE -- dps too low<br>
Arms PvP -- possibly too good (but we&apos;ll see how 3.1.2 goes)<br>
Fury PvP -- not concerned about it being too good (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17223174426-fury-a-simple-fix.html))</div></div>
