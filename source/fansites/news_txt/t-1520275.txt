Warlords of Draenor - UI Improvements
Today we are taking a look at a few of the UI improvements coming in Warlords of Draenor. 


The Dungeon Journal now includes short overviews of the fight for each role, which should help players that don't know the fights. 
The Key Binding UI has also been improved to a tabbed list rather than a very long list you have to scroll through. 
You are now able to manage addons in game without having to log out. The Simple Addon Control http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/simple-addon-control or Addon Control Panel http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/acp addons will do the same thing now.

I don't mean to be a pain, but it seems Scent of Blood "requires" multistrike, is this meant to be the case? or just in addition
Yes, it is. Blood gets some Multistrike baseline though. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466009570683265024

Two questions I'd love public clarification on. 1. Do you intend to fix the bug with Reaping and DeathFrost Runes?
It's on our list, but I don't know when it'll get fixed. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466093125501337600
2. Using Icy Touch to convert Frost Runes to Death Runes for AoE feels awkward. Anything being done there?
No, we designed it such that that only comes into play if you AoE for long periods, or don't prepare so are encouraged to. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466093485074812928
But do you feel that will still apply in a WoD world where we're also slowed down considerably and transition and out and AE?
What are you thinking of when you say "slowed down considerably", or referring to faster AoE/ST transitions? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466098340384362496
I think you solved ST well in 5.2 with the PS change. Just feel that WoD's slowed down style won't mesh well with this AoE.
How long you need to prepare for only relates to rune regen speed, which I don't recall any changes to, offhand. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466100195973799936

I'm almost to the point where I think you should just make all runes into permanent Death Runes. And then go from there.
A very fair criticism of Death Knights would be that their resource system is overly complex. No changes currently planned tho. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466141102500626432

My apologies if this has been asked but what will the new Hunter Bear Trap do exactly? Bleed/snare, I'd imagine?
Very large bleed + Root. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466098416750047232
By very large does it means we want it in our rotation?
"Rotational" usually refers to something that's part of your rotation; this is more of a DPS cooldown. Like Stampede or Shadowfiend. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466140562282663936
Yes. Sorry I missed some tweets. Can you tell us if Lone Wolf is planned to be a DPS increase ~= to l100 row or neutral?
It'll be an increase, along with the rest of the row. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466146357791567872

Frost bomb has cast time the others don't. Why? It's one of the biggest factors of myself never using it.

Any chance the delay in BrM's Power Guard buff from Tiger Palm will be removed or significantly shortened going into WoD?
Power Guard is gone, actually. It was pointless; it was always up. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465966835288924161

are there concerns that chi explosion won't be used by Mythic BrM tanks due to the loss of chi pooling?
Not really. You pool mostly for Purifying, which that still preserves. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466004879475896321
I'm talking about the ability to pool chi for timed Guard uptimes.With CE, the ability to due so is made more difficult,it seems
Right, that's why I said 'mostly'. Guard is the other one you can pool for, but it's much less of the time. Can just pool CE too. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466008909828743168
But with that I can hold 2 chi and with ascension, us the other 3 chi for blackout kick/Purify. With CE, it seems more about...
But how long/often are you going to do that? You never need to time Blackout Kicks, just Purifies. So it's just Purify vs Guard... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466009780536868864
...in competition. With Chi Explosion, it's Chi Explosion vs Guard. A little harder, but not much. Besides, you still have Purify. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466009943263281152

But can we really plan ahead with CE? We need the Shuffle buff, don't want to cap energy. CE 'll suck out all our Chi.
Shuffle is a natural pool itself; you never pool for BoK/Shuffle. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466024666830602240
Which may turn mythic tanks off from the talent, due to complexity that essentially can be avoided.
It definitely adds the most complexity of any talent on the row. But that's cool for many players. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466139577506615296

How is Soothing Mist going to work fluidly when all efficient Chi builders require you to break the channel constantly?
We may different definitions of 'constantly'. Especially when those efficient Chi builds are great for movement so couldn't Sooth Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466098846355828736
Any heal on another target or any chi building will break it. Based on my current knowledge that happens a lot, even now
Surging will be a significant source of your chi generation. Soothing different targets requires swapping, of course. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466101967412936704
That would require the WoD version of Surging to be mana efficient. Last report indicates that it's not in that category
There's your misunderstanding. It does *not* require Surging to be mana efficient. You absolutely can use some inefficient spells. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466103216556367872

are you guys looking to make ret more about sustained dmg and less reliant on CDs for dmg and pressure in WoD?
We're looking to do that for *everyone*. Cooldown stacking is a huge problem on live that we want to solve. Moreso in PvE than PvP Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466102370435215360

Seal of Justice doesn't procc if i do a Judgement. Seal of Truth does. Is this Intended?

35% weapon damage on slam... WTF you just ruined Arms. Slam is our biggest source of damage, slam offsets the lack of crit
Perhaps you should wait until you see the full picture before deciding that a spec is 'ruined'. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465939462715748352

Why the priority rotation of CS>MS>OP>Slam is what makes the spec fun, if your just swapping the spell priority then fine.
The goal of the changes we're working on is to simultaneously A Remove useless complexity, and B Add gameplay depth. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465955591911776256

to be buffed to 200% otherwise, Arms is about hard single hits fury is the small multi hit spec.
There are significant changes to Arms coming, which you don't know about. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465945800208424960
Can we please get some details? O hope your not changing the rotation or making it RNG dependent like fury
We are changing the rotation. Details will be coming soon. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465947160433811456
please don't turn it into a button spamfest like fury. Having one or two slower specs in the game is not a bad thing
We're planning to play up the differences between Arms and Fury. Arms should be the 'fewer hits but bigger hits' type. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465955294753734656
oh no Please not another Warrior pvp expac
And C Not increase PvP burst. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465956233858408448

Character / Items
If gear changes with spec, what happens with gems/chants? We re-gem/re-chant every time we spec swap? Two gear sets seems better..?
Warlords has less gems/enchants. Anyone compelled to have multiple sets of gear will need duplicates in far less slots. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/465649341555048449

Are there any plans 2 fix the issue of: Tier Bonus so good I can't swap my NMode gear for HNonTier drops? Hgear rusting=NoFun
That doesn't make gear get DE'd any more than it would anyway. If you're eventually going to use it, keep it. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466092987361939457

Warlords of Draenor Stats
So they intend my Boomkin to off spec run with agility gems/chants? Concept is almost good, but not yet.
there will be no primary stat gems or enchants. Secondaries only. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/465889532479430657

Cataclysm PvE
Cata dungeons at release were some of the only fun dungeons I played. You can disagree, but I liked the difficulty.
So did many people. But for entry-level content with few alternatives at the time, it was a problem. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/465871248183291904

Raids weren't over-tuned in Cata, period. Half my raid was "below average" and were knocking out bosses steadily. If they could do it ..
Then you're misperceiving what "average" is; I assure you, if you were clearing 4.0 raids steadily, your group was above average. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/465873187797213184

Mist of Pandaria PvE
Any plans to get rid of debuffs remaining on MC'd targets after player regains control in Garrosh fight? i.e. Slows @Celestalon
No, that's part of the intended challenge of mind controls. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466139728874446848

Empowered adds on Flex need less HP. Normal-geared grps ignore entirely, burn Garry thru P3. Not a viable strat for 540 ilvl ppl
Reducing add health is double-edged; makes it easier for them to accidentally die before being split, which is worse. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/465869923097796608

This is in response to new MMOC number showing lower % of people who do Flex have killed Garry than normal groups.
Different populations; Flex encompasses a much wider audience. In any case, we did make some Flex Garrosh adjustments last week. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/465870042253766657

Warlords of Draenor PvE
Any chance that "invite group" would be a thing? Like.. Group merging? Pugging with my SO is.. troublesome 
You'll be able to register in Group Finder as a party. So you could list yourselves together and would be invited together. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466257422298783744

What about people who want raid exp and insane ilvl? That's the main problem with joining a pug.
Group leaders are free to ask for whatever they want. But reasonable ones will have a much easier time finding people. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466303994705367040

hows that going to work for LFR, bosses just wont spawn that arent in your wing?
That's how we've done it before. Close some doors, open others, etc. Like Downfall, where door to Spoils is locked. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/465872231495921665

No tier gear for LFR is a great incentive to make casuals go flex/normal. But if we cannot find raids now - how will we in #WOD?
Our new Group Finder tool will assist with just that question. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465938923395371008

PersLoot gear in Normal/Heroic/Mythic be trade-able? Ex: 2 hunters, 1 gets bow it doesn't need.
No, personal loot and tradeable are two concepts that don't/can't mix; it would open the door to all kinds of abuse. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466041583528198144

Can you expound on why Mythic can't be loot locked? I want to be in a mythic guild but still progress with more casual friends.
Flexible lockouts allow for split main/alt raids to funnel loot to mains, while keeping the ability to unify for progression WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466306814661767168
Basically, much higher likelihood for abuse in Mythic, compared with lower demand for flexibility for the "right" reasons. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466307089610969088

PvP
Why in the world would a Mythic raider be high-lvl pvp rdy? Will a 2200 pvp'er be Mythic rdy? Apples/Oranges...
Misinterpreting this. Mythic raider won't need gear from honor but will definitely need gear from conquest. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/465653072232865792

Doesn't that have "abusive" potential with bringing 40 man raids to stomp the other faction?
It does. We have to weigh the edge case of large groups against the more common "I want to play with my friend" case holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/465672207231123456

Garrisons
Then why are the garrisons always themed human/orc? Not a very great look for any of the Elven races.
Some buildings have influences, peons are from SW tho, know how to work stone. Cool idea for future content. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/465751878748631041


Computers - Setup of the Month
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/ssdgraph.gif are stable, with all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. 

The Haswell refresh is here for non-overclockable CPUs, with the overclockable versions likely coming in the next few months. These may offer somewhat better overclocking performance, which may worth waiting for if you are overclocking to the limits of air cooling.

The Haswell CPUs http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1 run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&tag=mmochamp-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A. 

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx and Nvidia http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/290-Computer for any extra questions!
