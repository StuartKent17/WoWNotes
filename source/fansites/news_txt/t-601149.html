The hotfix entails a slight adjustment to the hitpoints of some of the adds that spawn during the encounter. The fix should go live in the next 24 hours.<br>
<br>
So ... Death and Taxes getting the patch first during the downtime and killing her ? Or will it be a fix without downtime, allowing Nihilum and Curse to work on her one more day than Death and Taxes before their instance resets ?<br>
