Arena Improvement Suggestions<br>
Hey guys, this thread looks great, but I wanted to just jump in and comment on a few things.<br>
<br>
There needs to be a large overhaul of the Arena system.<br>
We can see some reasons here why you feel this, but what is the over-arching reason for why you feel that the arena system currently does not function optimally and needs to undergo such dramatic changes? As of right now, I feel that the arena system works quite well. I am enjoying myself when I enter arena because of the competition side of it, as well as looking forward to both upgrading my gear more and &#x2026;hopefully&#x2026;winning a title and mount at the end of the season<br>
<br>
So what should happen is that when you join Arena you get a full set of Gear and when you leave it, you no longer have that set<br>
So you would like to see standardized stats and gear for all who enter arena so that the gear you have earned does not affect your performance? This could cause a large number of the PvP community to stop arena as they would no longer see a result of earning their new shiny gear, I agree that the standardized gear would make the playing-field more even but where would I be able to let loose with all of my awesome new gear? :&#x2019;( How could such a problem be remedied?<br>
<br>
Thirdly, you have to start giving our desire-able rewards.<br>
The reason I see that players aim to receive the title and mount is for the prestige that can be displayed with them. However if you feel that this can be done better through different types of rewards, what type of prizes for the seasons winners would you like to see?<br>
<br>
You could give rating based gear that has different colors? Just give it no stats so you can transmog into it to show off your rating you&apos;ve achieved?<br>
So, you do not want your Arena gear to give any stats &#x2014; just something you can transmog the gear you get from other sources into for the looks and your stats are standardized in your arena matches?

<br>
Ironman Challenge Achievement<br>
Considering people can start Death Knights at level 55, stack up on heirlooms to level much quicker, use RAF to level up without leaving a city, and now we have the SoR feature which grants a level 80 character, the achievement would be much easier for some to get than others. You could rule out people that used some of these services I suppose, but where would you draw the line?

Let&#x2019;s Talk Updated Scroll of Resurrection<br>
We recently re-launched the World of Warcraft Scroll of Resurrection (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/services/scroll-of-resurrection/) with new mounts, instant character boosts to level 80, free upgrades to Cataclysm for players who don&#x2019;t own all the expansions, and much more. Today, we&#x2019;d like to take a look at some of the finer points of this powerful new way to reconnect with your friends in Azeroth.<br>
<br>
First steps <br>
If your friend hasn&#x2019;t played since December 2009 (or earlier), he or she will first need to upgrade to a free Battle.net account before you can send a Scroll. Just have your friend log in to Battle.net and follow the instructions to merge a World of Warcraft account to a free Battle.net account. Returning players may want to add an authenticator (http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/adding-and-removing-authenticators) to their Battle.net accounts while they&#x2019;re at it. Attaching an authenticator isn&#x2019;t required for the Scroll of Resurrection promotion, but it&#x2019;s always a good idea.<br>
<br>
Eligibility<br>
To be eligible to receive a Scroll, your friend must have previously subscribed to World of Warcraft for at least 30 days, and your friend&#x2019;s account must have been inactive since March 4, 2012 or earlier. You can send a maximum of two Scrolls of Resurrection per day (one from within game, and one from within Battle.net), so choose your recipients carefully. Aside from this daily limit, there is no limit to the total number of Scrolls you can send, but all Scroll invitations expire if not claimed within 30 days.<br>
<br>
The Scroll of Resurrection is for previous World of Warcraft subscribers. If you&#x2019;re looking to recruit someone who has never played before, check out our Recruit a Friend (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/services/recruit-a-friend/) program.<br>
<br>
A little patience at first<br>
Scrolls of Resurrection are sent out once a day in large batches, so it can take some time for your friend to receive it. Be patient!<br>
<br>
How the rewards work<br>
The Scroll of Resurrection provides your returning friends with an upgrade to World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, a single character immediately boosted all the way to level 80, and seven days of free play time. Your friend also gains access to a free realm/faction transfer so the two of you can play together.<br>
<br>
As a reward for inviting your friend back to the game, we are offering a free Spectral Gryphon for Alliance characters or a Spectral Wind Rider for Horde characters, which you&#x2019;ll receive once your resurrected friend purchases at least 30 days of game time. You&#x2019;ll find your beautifully translucent reward mount(s) waiting for you in the Battle.net Account Management site, under &#x201C;Referrals &amp; Rewards -- History/Status.&#x201D; (https://us.battle.net/account/management/wow/services/raf-status.html)<br>
<br>
Get &#x2018;em while they&#x2019;re hot<br>
The Scroll of Resurrection is a limited promotion. We&#x2019;ll let you know well in advance of its expiration, but don&#x2019;t wait to take advantage of this opportunity. Click here (https://us.battle.net/account/management/wow/services/sor-invite.html?locale=en-us) to start sending Scrolls of Resurrection and bring your friends back to Azeroth! <br>
