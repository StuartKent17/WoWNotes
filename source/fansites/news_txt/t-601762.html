I don&apos;t have time to answer all my mails lately (and if you think I forgot to answer something important, just mail again). This week end was a problem because I had to answer 17 mails about Diablo 3, it&apos;s not that I don&apos;t like the game, but I don&apos;t really see why everyone went berserk in the middle of august with absolutely nothing new about the game in the last month. I guess it&apos;s time for a short explanation.<br>
<br>
Box art<br>
A lot of site used a potential box art to announce that it would be shown at the Games Convention. This box art is a 2 years old fake and was first posted on a korean website in 2005. (And was reported on a lot of sites like kotaku.com (http://kotaku.com/gaming/pc/diablo-3-art-and-details-115953.php))<br>

<br>
Recruitment<br>
A month ago, Blizzard confirmed (http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14691) that they were working on a secret project and updated the job application page with tons of things. Well ... It shows that they&apos;re working on a new game, which isn&apos;t very surprising since it&apos;s what they did for the past fifteen years, but I doubt they created enough content on Diablo 3 to show anything one month later at the Game Convention.<br>
<br>
Registered domains<br>
www.diablo3.eu (http://www.diablo3.eu) is probably the most popular, because it is registered by Blizzard and shows a 403 error (like the WotLK page before the release). The only problem with that is the fact that www.diablo4.eu (http://www.diablo4.eu), www.starcraft3.eu (http://www.starcraft3.eu), www.worldofwarcraft2.eu (http://www.worldofwarcraft2.eu), and www.warcraft4.eu (http://www.warcraft4.eu) are also registered by Blizzard and shows a 403 error. <br>
<br>
Hints from various artists<br>
Richard A. Knaak hinted (http://www.blizzplanet.com/content/601/) that he &quot;wasn&apos;t writing for a dead game&quot; when asked if his book could have an impact on Diablo 3 storyline.<br>
There is a 2007 artwork of Diablo on Sonsofthestorms.com (http://www.sonsofthestorm.com/viewer_raneman.php?cat=diablo&amp;art=4) (Samwise Didier&apos;s site). If you check the previous artworks, you&apos;ll see covers from the books written by Knaak, we can assume it was made later. (And it was actually used on the Blizzcon brochure)<br>

<br>
Conclusion<br>
Diablo 3 is under development, of course. Why the hell wouldn&apos;t they use something as popular (and great) as Diablo to create new games ? But I don&apos;t see any reason to announce anything about an online game one month after WotLK, they&apos;ll probably just do it during one of the next Blizzcon. (and by the way, keep in mind that the Games Convention will have a WotLK trailer) <br>
<br>
No more mails about it, please, however you&apos;re free to mail me to tell me that I&apos;m nice.<br>
