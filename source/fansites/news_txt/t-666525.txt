They are now working on Twin Valkyrs and still have 32 attempts left, we will probably see more first kills on US realms soon.

Koralon will drop loot for slots similar to Emalon, which includes both raiding tier items and PvP gear. Both 10- and 25-player versions will drop Emblems of Triumph as well.

Combustion
There are two slightly entwined problems here. One is Combustion just not keeping up with other mage talents. That's a problem we want to fix. While there are plenty of examples of talents that aren't as popular as they should be, we consider Combustion to be a pretty core talent to the Fire mage experience, and thus we consider it a bigger problem. And no, we aren't ready to announce a change yet.

The other is that character stats are much higher than we originally predicted. This is less of a big deal for things like Str and Sta that can just keep growing, but it gets messy with the ratings like crit and avoidance. While more crit is generally always better, you do run into weird scenarios when players can realistically think about 100% crit chances if not now, perhaps in Icecrown.

The reason the stats got so high is that the Ulduar model of gear where hard modes offer higher ilevel was something we added after ship and therefore after the core combat mechanics of Lich King were already in place. We designed the system with lower numbers from gear than we are ultimately going to end up offering. You might be able to guess at the highest ilevels in Icecrown and those are higher than we originally planned on them being. The alternative was that hard modes didn't offer better loot. :

Anyway, we can tweak the combat formulae to some extent, but short of "Icecrown Radiance" that drops your crit by 10%, some of these issues aren't going to go away until the level cap increases and we can adjust all of the combat ratings again.
