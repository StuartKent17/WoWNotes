It also means that the shamans will get some tier 10 love really soon (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/november/shamanlove.jpg). Also, the blue posters will most likely be back today!<br>

Shadowmourne - Legendary Axe<br>
The end of the PTR is near and it&apos;s time for a new preview of Shadowmourne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49623/shadowmourne/), mostly to give you a much more interesting video of the weapon. <br>
<br>
Keep in mind that you will have to defeat Sindragosa to claim the weapon and it will take months before the encounter is unlocked on live servers. <br>

<br>
The first quest is given by Darion Mograine in the Icecrown Citadel, the only prerequisite is to be friendly with the Ashen Verdict (http://db.mmo-champion.com/f/1156/the-ashen-verdict/). Of course it&apos;s not that simple and the very first quest will require you to obtain Primordial Saronite (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49908/primordial-saronite/) x 25 along with quest items from Festergut (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=892) and Rotface (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=899). Primordial Saronite (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49908/primordial-saronite/) is the new rare reagent from raid bosses (The new Crusader&apos;s Orb (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/47556/crusader-orb/) basically) and it won&apos;t be easy to get 25 of them ... <br>
<br>
The Sacred and the Corrupt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24545/the-sacred-and-the-corrupt/)<br>
It is against my judgment that I present you this errand, &lt;race&gt;, as it will likely end in your undoing. Ignore my counsel and embark on the endeavor, and I shall provide you with the knowledge and resources to see it through.<br>
<br>
You must return to Frostmourne Cavern and recover Light&apos;s Vengeance, Arthas&apos; discarded hammer. Reforged with saronite and etched with the acidic blood of the Lich King&apos;s abominations, it will provide the foundation for our work. <br>
<br>
Unholy Infusion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24749/unholy-infusion/)<br>
Before your weapon can reach its full potential it must be endowed with its signature powers. First among them is unholiness. You must seek out and defeat the one called Professor Putricide, but his death is not your only goal. You must use his resources against him.<br>
<br>
Find a way to absorb his mutated slime. Use the foul substance to infuse your weapon with the power of the unholy. Only when this has been done shall I reveal your next task. <br>
<br>
Blood Infusion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24756/blood-infusion/)<br>
Your weapon is now prepared to be endowed with the power of blood. You are to face Queen Lana&apos;thel in battle and bathe the axe in her Blood Mirror power. When it has been fully infused, you must slay her unmercifully.<br>
<br>
May her screams pierce the ears of the Lich King as he awaits his fate. <br>
<br>
Frost Infusion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24757/frost-infusion/)<br>
Shadow&apos;s Edge is prepared to receive its final infusion of power. Sindragosa, the enemy&apos;s own mount, must fall. But before she is brought down, you must sustain three of her frozen breath attacks without tasting death. <br>
<br>
Without his dragon, nothing shall stand between you and the Lich King. <br>
<br>
The Splintered Throne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24548/the-splintered-throne/)<br>
The Lich King&apos;s throne once served as his prison. Kil&apos;jaeden himself crafted the vessel of icy crystals from the twisting nether. Its sole purpose was to hold Ner&apos;zhul&apos;s vengeful spirit. When Arthas struck the crystal with Frostmourne, he released Ner&apos;zhul&apos;s soul, allowing it to merge with with his own. Splinters from that impact are now scattered throughout the citadel.<br>
<br>
I shall require those shards, held only by the Lich King&apos;s most powerful servants, to seal the power contained in your blade. <br>
<br>
A Feast of Souls (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24547/a-feast-of-souls/)<br>
Shadow&apos;s Edge is among the greatest weapons a &lt;class&gt; could hope to obtain. Is your lust for power sated, &lt;race&gt;? &lt;You feel Mograine&apos;s penetrating gaze.&gt;<br>
<br>
I thought not. A final warning then... You now embark on the most treacherous leg of your quest. Bridle your aspirations, for if your aims are impure then your life, your very soul, is forfeit.<br>
<br>
The weapon you hold is but an empty husk, a mere shadow of what it may become. Only the devouring of a thousand souls will unlock its true potential. <br>
<br>
Shadowmourne ... (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24549/shadowmourne/)<br>
Highlord Darion Mograine wants you to bring him Shadow&apos;s Edge.<br>
<br>
This quest isn&apos;t fully implemented yet but already rewards you with Shadowmourne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49623/shadowmourne/) ... <br>
<br>
The Lich King&apos;s Last Stand (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24748/the-lich-kings-last-stand/)<br>
Shadowmourne; a newly forged weapon already steeped in this world&apos;s history, reborn into an unrivaled destiny. With this weapon you bear a solemn responsibility, and the time to carry out that charge is at hand. <br>
<br>
Take this weapon of myth and legend and march on the enemy. Avenge the countless heroes lost in his merciless campaign. Bring rest to their tortured souls. <br>
<br>
Steel yourself, &lt;class&gt;, and guide Shadowmourne to fulfill the purpose of its creation. <br>
