I'll make sure to write an extensive review of this wonderful tool as soon as Apple offers to send me a free iPhone. 
Ever wanted to check your raid schedule, look up a piece of PvP gear, or concoct a new talent spec while on the go? The new World of Warcraft Mobile Armory app for iPhone and iPod touch lets you access the official Armory database from anywhere you have a mobile connection, and features much of the same functionality as the Armory website www.wowarmory.com , including:

* Search for and view any character, item, guild, or Arena team in World of Warcraft.
* Seamlessly import your own character, guild, and Arena team profiles.
* Access your in-game calendar of events.
* View achievement-point leaderboards.
* Plan out talent specs using the fully functional talent calculator.

The World of Warcraft Mobile Armory is available now as a free download from the App Store on iPhone and iPod touch or at www.itunes.com/appstore/
