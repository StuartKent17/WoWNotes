Patch 7.2.5 - Blight Boar<br>
The new band is finished setting up at the Darkmoon Faire in Patch 7.2.5! Their name? Blight Boar.<br>
<br>
Baby, baby, baby! This is the illest, realest, deadest band you&apos;ve ever seen! They will melt your face, figuratively and literally! Before I met these guys, I was alive and had all my skin! Now I&apos;m dead and filthy rich!<br>
Catch Blight Boar here, every hour on the half hour!<br>
Or you could come see a GOOD band! The Blight Boar concert will begin in thirty minutes!<br>
If you&apos;re interested in gettin&apos; down, the Blight Boar concert starts in twenty!<br>
Blight Boar is playing their underground show on the east side of the island! Your headliner Blight Boar goes on in ten minutes!<br>
My rockin&apos; and rollin&apos; beauties! You&apos;re in the right place to melt your face! Allow me to humbly introduce... Blight Booooar!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I will prove once and for all that only a knight from the grave can rule heavy metal.<br>
Though you fight to stay alive, your bodies freeze and shatter!<br>
Darkness falls across the land, the rocking hour is close at hand!<br>
Grisly ghouls from every tomb are closing in to seal your doom.<br>
Another soul for getting down.<br>
Another soul for my armies!<br>
You have failed Blight Boar, your fans now serve my armies of the dead!<br>
