Blizzcast - Episode 1<br>
It seems that Blizzplanet (http://www.blizzplanet.com/news/1954/) got a few more details on the Blizzcast we talked about a few days ago. Don&apos;t take it as an official statement but I doubt it&apos;s gonna change a lot anyway. <br>
The first BlizzCast episode will air online through Blizzard&apos;s website the first week of January. Fans will be able to submit questions to the developers through the fansites, who will forward the feedback to community managers: Karune and Nethaera. Fans may win some juicy Swag at the end of each BlizzCast episode. Again, this ongoing video podcast series is produced by Blizzard.<br>
<br>
This is an amazing effort that will bring the developers and the community closer. The best of it all is that each BlizzCast (video podcast) transcript will be fully localized to many supported languages reaching hundreds of thousands of Blizzard fans across the globe. This is basically a monthly BlizzCon presentation broadcasted directly to you via hot-download. The audience of BlizzCast Episode 1 and upcoming episodes will be monitored. These is an experimental in-house project. The more fan audience supporting these BlizzCast episodes, the better it will get, as more resources will be put to produce future episodes with full coverage of the development cycles of Starcraft 2, future World of Warcraft expansions and content patches, as well as the two unannounced games. Spread the word across forums online, and share the hype to encourage production of BlizzCast episodes for years to come. Tell all your friends online, at work or school to download episode one the first week of January.<br>

Addon - Cartographer_Route<br>
It&apos;s been huh ... A very long time since the last addon review, but considering how slow the news are lately it looks like a good idea to bring them back to life !<br>
<br>
Today we&apos;ll talk about a module of the well-known Cartographer addon : Cartographer_Route<br>
<br>
What does it do ? In a few words, it &quot;links&quot; all the mining nodes on your map and minimap and shows the shortest route between them. That&apos;s VERY useful if you want to mine efficiently, especially in Outland with an epic flying mount. <br>
<br>
What do you need ?<br>
1. Cartographer (http://files.wowace.com/Cartographer/Cartographer.zip)<br>
2. Cartographer_Mining (http://files.wowace.com/Cartographer_Mining/Cartographer_Mining.zip) / Cartographer_Herbalism (http://files.wowace.com/Cartographer_Herbalism/Cartographer_Herbalism.zip) / Cartographer_Fishing (http://files.wowace.com/Cartographer_Fishing/Cartographer_Fishing.zip) / Cartographer_ExtractGas (http://files.wowace.com/Cartographer_ExtractGas/Cartographer_ExtractGas.zip) depending on what you want to gather.<br>
3. Cartographer_Routes (http://files.wowace.com/Cartographer_Routes/Cartographer_Routes.zip)<br>
4. Anything else (http://files.wowace.com/sw-c.html) you need on wowace.com (http://files.wowace.com/sw-c.html)<br>
<br>
Setup<br>
It&apos;s fairly easy to get it working if you don&apos;t really want to tweak it. <br>
1. Extract everything in your /Interface/Addons folder as usual<br>
2. Launch the game, open your map, and go in the Cartographer menu<br>
3. Pick the route submenu and select add. Chose all the nodes you want to &quot;track&quot; on your map and minimap, and create the route. (Screenshot #1 (http://azeroth.mmo-champion.com/media/carto1.jpg)<br>
4. Voila ! You&apos;ve got an impressive path between each node ! Impressive isn&apos;t it ? Yeah, not really because it&apos;s not readable in its current state. (Screenshot #2 (http://azeroth.mmo-champion.com/media/carto2.jpg))<br>
5. Hopefully, you can optimize everything, select the route you just created in the submenu and take a look at the &quot;Optimize route&quot; part. Depending on how you want to spend your resources (read the tooltips in game) you can select Background/Foreground optimization, and even add a few extra optimizations.

6. Get yourself a coffee while it&apos;s working.<br>
7. Enjoy your easy gathering ! (Screenshot #4 (http://azeroth.mmo-champion.com/media/carto4.jpg))<br>

You might want to disable the minimap notes (Notes submenu) and lower the opacity of the route to make it easier to spot nodes on the minimap.</div></div>
