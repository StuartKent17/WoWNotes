Who has your six in this six vs. six brawl? Deep Six will put you and your group to the test.<br>

Every other week, a new PvP Brawl will be available to players looking for something just a little different. Each Brawl will offer a variety of modes, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay, and you&#x2019;ll find them in the Group Finder tool (hotkey &#x201C;I&#x201D;) in the Player vs. Player tab.

Deep Six pits teams of six players against each other in three iconic Battlegrounds: Warsong Gulch, Silvershard Mines, and Temple of Kotmogu. Each Battleground offers a little variation on the traditional format, such as flags that are a bit closer in Warsong Gulch, less carts to keep track of in Silvershard Mines, and only two orbs within the Temple of Kotmogu.</div></div>
