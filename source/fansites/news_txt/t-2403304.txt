General feeling seems to be that Legion had solid content drip, but maybe 7.1 was a little too fast. That said, is there anything you'd change about the content per patch? If you could swap X for Y. I.e. "7.X could have used a ___, I would have swapped that for ___." Muffinus 

Which legendary is your favorite re: acquisition? We've had a lot of them, from a hammer and sword and staff to a bow and glaive to a hammer again and an axe to a cloak etc. Muffinus 

Will completing the campaign with both an Alliance and Horde character be required for Pathfinder Part 1 achievement?
No. In Battle for Azeroth, you'll only need to complete one of either the Horde or the Alliance campaigns to earn the Pathfinder Part 1 Achievement. WarcraftDevs 

you mentioned in an interview awhile back that you guys were looking at what to do with pet stables. Any news?
Nothing to share yet, sorry! Realize this is a big deal to hunters though. Muffinus
