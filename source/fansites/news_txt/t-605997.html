[anchor=swplat]Sunwell Plateau (25 Players)<br>
Note on Kil&apos;jaeden loot : Nobody killed him yet, however he will most likely be the only one dropping ilvl 164 items. You can already check a few of them at the Sunwell vendor but I&apos;ll only list the 3 that really look like they drop from Kil&apos;jaeden himself (based on their itemID mostly). <br>
Note on the &quot;Pre-PTR Leak&quot; : A lot of weapons stats have been leaked through this Sunwell Loot screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/sunwell_loots.jpg) released before the PTR, so far nothing changed and you probably want to check it for items that aren&apos;t listed below yet. <br>
Note: Not all these items drop directly. Some of them are gained by exchanging one of the drops and a [item=34664] for a new item from the Shattered Sun Offensive vendor on the Sunwell Isle. These items are tagged with a (*).<br>

Very important note : Most of these items have &quot;outdated&quot; stats, the armor on the sets should be slightly higher. The only armor set up-to-date with the latest version of the PTR is the Paladin one.<br>

&lt;font face=arial size=2&gt;Fury of the Sunwell&lt;ul&gt; The glorious fount of arcane energy known as the Sunwell empowered the high elves for millennia, until the death knight Arthas laid siege to the elven kingdom and corrupted its sacred energies. Seeing no other alternative, a band of survivors led by Prince Kael&#x2019;thas destroyed the ancient fount. Over time the surviving elves fell pray to a crippling magical withdrawal.<br>
<br>
Now, promising salvation for his people, Kael&#x2019;thas has returned. Soon the Sunwell will shine once again, but whether the sacred fount will usher in deliverance or destruction remains to be seen.<br>
<br>
[/list]<br>
<br>
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=arial size=2&gt;In Memoriam: Gary Gygax&lt;ul&gt; Blizzard Entertainment would like to dedicate the patch in memory of Gary Gygax. His work on D&amp;D was an inspiration to us in many ways and helped spark our passion for creating games of our own. As avid D&amp;D players and fellow game developers, we were all saddened by the news of his passing; we feel we&#x2019;ve lost a true adventuring companion. &amp;#32;Thanks for everything and farewell, Gary. You will be missed.[/list]<br>
