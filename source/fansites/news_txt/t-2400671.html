With Legion coming to a close we thought we might try something a little different and collect some specific feedback on things. While we normally are reading tons of posts you guys make and sharing the details internally, we want to try collecting focused feedback to ensure your opinions are being heard. We&apos;re still doing our usual methods but want to see if this can be something we use going forward. <br>
<br>
For the first one we&apos;re going to try one focused on Mythic+! We want to hear everything you guys have on this feature we introduced in Legion. What you think it does well, what you think it doesn&apos;t, ways you&apos;d like to see it go, how did it work throughout the course of the expansion, etc. <br>
<br>
Also a friendly note that just because you see it here doesn&apos;t mean it will be changed or added - and this topic is not an indication of future feature development.</div></div>
