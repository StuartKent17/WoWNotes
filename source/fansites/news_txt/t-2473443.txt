Crucible of Storms Drop Tuning
When Crucible of Storms was originally added to the 8.1.5 PTR a few weeks ago, we included full drop tables for both Restless Cabal and Uu’nat. We designed Crucible of Storms drops to be somewhat different than items that have been dropping thus far in Uldir and Battle of Dazar’alor – this is a new chapter in the story that takes us to a different, stranger place.

We’ve recently gone through those items and tuned them up to fit closer to expectations, and in most cases, to power up their bonus effects. Here are some examples of changes we’ve made since the items first hit the PTR:


Fa'thuul's Floodguards https://www.wowdb.com/items/167842-fathuuls-floodguards?bonusIDs=1517

Damage increased by ~25%
Healing increased by ~25%

Abyssal Speaker's Gauntlets https://www.wowdb.com/items/167841-abyssal-speakers-gauntlets?bonusIDs=1517

Shield increased by ~200%

Mindthief's Eldritch Clasp https://www.wowdb.com/items/167840-mindthiefs-eldritch-clasp?bonusIDs=1517

Health restored and consumed increased by ~35%

Grips of Forsaken Sanity https://www.wowdb.com/items/167839-grips-of-forsaken-sanity?bonusIDs=1517

Damage increased by ~25%

Legplates of Unbound Anguish https://www.wowdb.com/items/167217-legplates-of-unbound-anguish?bonusIDs=1517

Damage increased by ~25%



We’ve been making these adjustments via hotfix to the PTR since Friday, and we don’t expect that you’re going to see them via datamining immediately, but know that these are intended changes, and hopefully they’re now quite close to final values.



Tiger's Peak Temporarily Closing
In order to fix some issues with Tiger’s Peak, we’re removing it from the pool of Arena maps. This should take place during our next scheduled maintenance. We expect to re-open this Arena in a future update to the game.
