Boubouille2007-10-29, 08:15 PMUpdate : Added a small recap of the less important blue post at the end of the post.

Anticipated news post because we just had 3 very interesting blue posts, will update in a few hours with the "minor" blue posts. 

Season 2 Team Qualification
A few days ago, Blizzard announced that they will "filter" inactive arena teams before giving out arena season 2 rewards, Drysc posted an explanation about this.
While the date for the end of Season 2 has not yet been announced, we wanted to let everyone know beforehand about a change to the requirements for a team to be counted towards the total teams considered for the end of season rewards.

Our goal with this change is to remove teams from being counted that could not already be eligible for the end of season rewards. By not counting them weâ€™re effectively limiting the pool of teams that are added up before calculating the final 0.5% for the end of season rewards.

The requirements for a team to be counted both requirements must be met:
The team must have played at least 20 games during the season.
The team must have at least one player that has played in 20% or more of the total games for that team.



As the requirement to be eligible for the end of season rewards is also 20% participation for the entire season, this overlap merely ensures that teams that have active and eligible members will be counted.

Focused Will changes
Focused Will http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/focusedwill.jpg is being changed.
We wanted you to know that we're going to be redesigning the new discipline talent, focused will, so please hold off on providing further feedback on the ability until the new version is announced and/or it's pushed to the public test realms. The goal of the talent will still focus on survivability.

The intention of this talent is provide an alternative to the holy talent, blessed resilience, so the priest who desires a talent of this nature has more than one option, adding more flexibility to the talent choices they make leading up to either.

BG Daily quests will reward 400 honor, not 4000
This will probably make a lot of people sad, but it seems that the BG Daily quests rewards are totally wrong, they're supposed to reward 400 honor points, not 2000 or 4000 like what we saw in previous builds. 
It's off by a factor of 10. Battleground Daily quest bonus honor is supposed to be equivalent to 20 player kills at your level, ie 400 honor at level 70.

It's more or less a free battleground worth of honor, and that's what we've intended it to be. A bonus for hopping in that day's battleground.

There's a lot of concern that AV isn't providing as much honor as it is on live due to the changes on the PTR. Some changes have already gone in but we're still keeping track of and willing to make additional changes. We want the time/honor ratio of AV to be as close to what it is now as possible, and if it looks like that's not the case even after bumping the honor and decreasing the amount of resources then we'll make additional changes.

Other Blueposts
Guild Banks
If leadership of a guild is transfered the new leader now has full access to the guild bank. If the guild is disbanded the current guild leader gets all the items in the bank via his mailbox. If the guild leader was banned, you would most likely need to contact a GM to get leadership transfered.
