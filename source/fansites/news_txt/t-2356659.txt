Unholy

Dreadwake Armor 4-piece set bonus can now proc from its own bonus Death Coil. Proc chance reduced to 16% was 20%.

Developers’ notes: This fix addresses a bug that prevented the bonus from activating as often as intended, and should average a small increase in throughput for the Unholy 4-piece.

Fixed a bug preventing some Mages from progressing through the steps to obtain their hidden Artifact weapon appearance.




Items

Golganneth's Vitality should no longer break stealth when it procs.



Blue Tweets
What is the reason of the Antorus restriction for the Pantheon secondary proc ?
A mix of theming—the power of the Pantheon looms over Antorus—and worry that the trinkets could force awkwardly specific dungeon compositions for high-end Mythic Keystone dungeons. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/940655045481152512

After the release of patch 7.3.5 will the appearances of the artifacts be obtainable for characters who have just climbed to the maximum level?
Nothing is changing about artifact appearances in 7.3.5. After the Battle for Azeroth launches, you can earn all appearances except the Mage Tower weapon and Mythic Keystone 15 variant. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/940654728031059968


This Week in WoW History
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.

Cataclysm Midnight Launch
The midnight launch event for the third expansion of the game was celebrated around the world. A short clip put together by blizzard shows fans from all over Europe, as North America. The launch event featured live music, cosplayers, and lots of WoW fans.

Subraces in WoW
In 2013 Shoc put together quite a few subrace mockups and shared them on the forums. This Fan Art was received very well by the community, and caught the attention of the Art Director, Chris Robinson. Several years later, Allied Races were announced and they are expected to be added to the game in the near future.

World of Warcraft Global Offensive
Ivan Kuzkin released another WoW Machinima, this time combining the popular FPS game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with World of Warcraft characters. The video featured the famous Dust II map, as the Alliance faction played the role of the Counter-Terrorists, and the Horde playing the role of the Terrorists.
