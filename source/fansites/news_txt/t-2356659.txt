Unholy

Dreadwake Armor 4-piece set bonus can now proc from its own bonus Death Coil. Proc chance reduced to 16% was 20%.

Developers’ notes: This fix addresses a bug that prevented the bonus from activating as often as intended, and should average a small increase in throughput for the Unholy 4-piece.

Arcane

Fixed a bug preventing some Mages from progressing through the steps to obtain their hidden Artifact weapon appearance.




Items

Golganneth's Vitality should no longer break stealth when it procs.

After the release of patch 7.3.5 will the appearances of the artifacts be obtainable for characters who have just climbed to the maximum level?
Nothing is changing about artifact appearances in 7.3.5. After the Battle for Azeroth launches, you can earn all appearances except the Mage Tower weapon and Mythic Keystone 15 variant. WarcraftDevs

In 2013 Shoc put together quite a few subrace mockups and shared them on the forums. This Fan Art was received very well by the community, and caught the attention of the Art Director, Chris Robinson. Several years later, Allied Races were announced and they are expected to be added to the game in the near future.


  

World of Warcraft Global Offensive
Ivan Kuzkin released another WoW Machinima, this time combining the popular FPS game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with World of Warcraft characters.
