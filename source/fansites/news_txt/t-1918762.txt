Any chance we will see a better prot warrior soloing in legion? Gladiator Stance was awesome, and I'm sad to see it go.
All tanks will be excellent at solo play in Legion, and deal respectable damage on top of their great survivability. WarcraftDevs 

What's the intended route for tanks and healers leveling? Grab their artifact then level dps?
Nope! Tanking and Healing specializations are being adjusted to be suitable for leveling as well. WarcraftDevs

Any word yet if Demon Hunters will be expected to use Fel Rush rotationally in raids for aoe damage? Could create problems tbh
We're currently experimenting with a few different options. Possibly only part of sustained AoE via a talent. Feedback welcome! WarcraftDevs

Please do not remove presences. They serve a key role in giving DKs choices in combat, and is a big utility they will miss
We can provide even better ways to make the same defensive choices in combat, and ensure DKs provide enough utility. WarcraftDevs

Any plans to Look at maybe tuning down Savage Roar to ensure the rest of the Feral 100 tier isn't overshadowed by it?
Yes. We're still experimenting with exactly where Savage Roar will go in the talent grid, and will tune accordingly. WarcraftDevs 

I love tree of life form but not the talent, any minor glyphs in the works for treant form model swap or something?
Treant form is sticking around, though it may be via a spell you learn instead of a glyph. WarcraftDevs 

Affinity: as a Guardian with Affinity Owl switching to Owl, can I be targeted by bossabilities only affecting ranged DDs?
None of the Affinities will change the targeting rules that affect you. WarcraftDevs

Hey boss can we get clarification? Will ALL Mech pets be difficult to tame, or just the "Rare" ones Inquireing Gnomes want to know
Currently there are only a few that arent hidden away, we will see how that plays out. Muffinus

Invisibility pruned from Mages in #Legion? If yes, why? Epecially in light of the Arcane PvP talent.
Nope, Invisibility is sticking around. Arcane even gets Greater Invisibility baseline. WarcraftDevs

can outlaw rogues get cheap shot back? playing my rogue in legion alpha feels really terrible without it as an opener
CC is being reduced across the board. Outlaws focus on in-combat CC. Instead of Cheap Shot, they use Bribe, Blind, and Gouge. WarcraftDevs 

Character / Items
. Is there any chance of reverting the mount size cap? Even a small one? If the answer is NO then just tell me I'm wasting my time
It was partially reverted in 6.2.3 i think? To allow you to still be like 50% bigger. Don't quote me on that number. Muffinus 

Any chance we can see crystallized fel being purchasable for all the excess valor that we all have now? 40weeks for 2 rings 
That's an interesting idea. Thanks for the suggestion! WarcraftDevs 

PvE
please tell me augment runes are a thing of the past
We haven't made a final decision yet, but we think they worked well as a luxury consumable and market commodity. WarcraftDevs 

Lore
Has there been a time skip between WoD and Legion? DH says BC was 10 years ago, but Wrath was only 4 years ago?
The Demon hunters in beta have a /silly joke line that shouldn't be taken as canon, if that's what you mean. DaveKosak 
They also say mention being imprisoned for 10 years in some of the quest text though?
Quest name? DaveKosak 

UI / Addons
will the new transmog system come with the prelaunch event or at launch of Legion?
In general, systems and UI improvements are tied to the pre-launch patch. WarcraftDevs
