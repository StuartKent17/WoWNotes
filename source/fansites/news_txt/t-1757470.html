Get Your BlizzCon Tickets This Week<br>
You can see what was in the Goody Bag last year (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4474-Blizzcon-2014-Day-0-Goody-Bag) to get an idea of what to expect this year.<br>
Just a reminder to set your alarms and sync up with your traveling companions: BlizzCon 2015 general admission tickets go on sale this week (http://www.eventbrite.com/e/blizzcon-november-6-7-2015-tickets-15752495137) in two batches&#x2014;one on Wednesday, April 15 at 7 p.m. PDT, and a second on Saturday, April 18 at 10 a.m. PDT. When the time comes, head to the BlizzCon ticketing page at the link below to try for tickets, and check out our original announcement (http://blizz.ly/BlizzCon2015) for all the details.<br>

A Bit o&#x2019; Good Goody Bag News<br>
If you can&#x2019;t make it to the show in person, this year there&#x2019;ll be a whole new way to bring a piece of the BlizzCon experience home: For the first time ever, Virtual Ticket buyers will have the option to purchase a BlizzCon Goody Bag of their own. Supplies will be limited, and some regional restrictions will apply&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll share additional information closer to the Virtual Ticket&#x2019;s launch, so keep an eye on BlizzCon.com in the months ahead.<br>
<br>
*NEW FOR 2015* Ticket Delivery and Making Name Changes<br>
Keep in mind that ticket buyers have until August 14 to change the names on each ticket they&#x2019;ve purchased. That means:<br>
<br>
<br>
For ticket buyers: If you bought tickets through Eventbrite and reassign them to someone else, make sure you tell the person you assigned it to previously that their ticket has been reassigned and will no longer grant entry to the show.<br>
For people who received tickets: If someone else bought tickets for you, double-check with them that your ticket is still in your name after the name-change deadline rolls around (August 14). <br>
<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT: In order to pick up a badge at BlizzCon, the name on your ticket must match the name on your photo ID, as well as the name assigned to the ticket in the ticketing system.<br>
<br>
That means if the ticket was reassigned to someone else without your knowledge and you show up to BlizzCon anyway, we won&#x2019;t be able to give you a badge&#x2014;so be careful when acquiring a ticket from a source you don&#x2019;t know and trust.<br>
<br>
One other important change for ticket buyers: This year, you&#x2019;ll be able to access and reprint your tickets at any time through your Eventbrite account. That means no more waiting around for us to send out a badge email, and no need to worry if you or your attendees lose that email or they get caught in your Spam filter.<br>
<br>
