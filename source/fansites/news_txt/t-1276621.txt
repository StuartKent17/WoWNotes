Patch 5.2 Dev Interviews
Let's take a look at another one of the dev interviews today, the MMORPG interview with Ghostcrawler http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game/15/feature/7216/Ghostcrawler-on-Thunder-King-and-Azeroths-Future.html.


New character models are still actively being worked on.
Pandaren are a good example of how detailed the new models will be. They have facial animations with moving eyes and mouths, fingers that are all individual and not just a mitten, as well as new animations. 
"MMORPG: As long as my Dwarf looks prettier. That’s a good thing. Greg: It is coming, and the new dwarf is very pretty."
Defense of the Alehouse is an experiment right now, with no definite release date. 
Blizzard is working on other battlegrounds that we likely will see sooner. 
Patch 5.3 will tell the story that leads up to the Siege of Orgrimmar. Varian will bring the Alliance together and push the Horde apart. 
Work had started on Patch 5.2 and 5.3 before 5.0 even launched. 
Blizzard can now plan for the next expansion far enough ahead to put some seeds of what is to come in the current story. 
On Blizzcon: "I think we’re going to have a lot to talk about."
Moving to free to play would require it to be more successful than the current business model, which isn't the case right now.

Automatic Flight Path Discovery Unintended
It looks like we can look forward to a post in the coming week about why automatic flight path discovery was unintended and is not coming back.

Blue Tweets
Character
Where's character progression for nonraiders when new valor gear requires raid rep? "Playing my way" was nice while it lasted.
There is gear on the non-raid reps Sunreaver and Kirin Tor, just not the best gear. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301570651767066624

A lot of post on fixing 25M raiding. I don't think it's broken, but we need some hlp with logistics and management. Any plans?
What would help with logistics and management? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/310467522480726016
We rely on third party websites and/or making endless level 1 alts to make contact with players.
Yeah, we need to come up with a communication system players can use for legit needs without opening up new ways for spam. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/310476911094685696

We got your stance about PlayerHousing it's a no-go for now, but what about GuildHousing?
We worry that guild housing is only content for the guild leaders. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301555364380422146

Are the new legendary meta gems replacing our normal meta gems or is it in addition to them?
They are just meta gems, so they replace the one you normally use. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302528896648224768

Why can't your team keep upgrades in for 5.0/5.1 gear only? Make them upgrade through Justice...
There is no technically simple way to do so. We agree upgrading the ilevel of blues in general feels good. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/306778036525731841

Why can't Fist-Weapons and daggers be interchangeable like every other 1h weapon for transmog now?
Animation technical limitation. Maybe someday. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/308787003435151361
Why doesnt that limitation apply to Guns/Bows/Crossbows, which all use different animations yet can be mogged?
Originally coded that way since the gun sounds bug some players so much. Not an unsolvable problem but it does take some code. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/308791798841630722

Hey Greg, I was just wondering: is there any posiblity that in the close future we will see cross realm herilooms?
Yeah, the possibility exists. We have no design objection. Mail wasn't set up to work that way. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/308739022925230080
couldn't uou change heirlooms to something like mounts? Scroll down ui that would help keep track. A lot better
Yeah I said last Blizzcon that I'd love to see that. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/308788577951690752

Hey guys, is the "Appear offline" feature going to be implemented tomorrow in 5.2? Thanks! 
Pretty sure it is not in 5.2. Ran into some technical limitations. Still like the design idea. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/308738071325728768

No interviewer has asked this past week about it so here goes: Update on model revamps? Last update was last year iirc
Any answer just tends to build excitement to a scary level so it's best just to keep quiet for now. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/307655034940841985

Are you going to fix the proc rate on the 5.2 trinkets? Currently they are way too unreliable.
We're considering some pseudo randomization in players' favor. E.g. if no proc, increase chance next time. Avoids bad streaks. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/310467406013296640
I really hope some action is taken on this quickly i'm going to be passing on trinkets in ToT on my shaman until then.
We think we're going to apply the pseudo random thing. We'll write up details somewhere players can see it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/311276270354853888

“Getting new gear is annoying. Cost of reforging, enchanting/gemming, transmogging void storage all add up. Blah.” @Ghostcrawler
We agree. Too much post-modification takes the fun out of getting a new piece. Need to work on that. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/312364499887865857

We also added some protection to the ToT RPPM trinkets to avoid streaks of bad luck and buffed some to boot. Details soon. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/311562675836551168
Do you think you may be setting a bad precedent? Soothing Mist and now trinkets have streak protection. Might become expected.
Would that be a bad thing? Quest drops have had it for years and we want to add it to bonus rolls as well. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/311946673381326848
Just worried you might be painting yourself into a corner. Precedents have come back to bite you before.
Funny you mention that, because I feel like precedents have become a big part of this job. Like being on a supreme court at times. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/312364161315266562

The new system will prevent unlucky streaks, but not lucky ones. Why not a ramping up proc chance from t=0 ? less variance
Lucky streaks were what we were trying to deliver. Otherwise, procs might as well be passives since they're so predictable. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/312360191289081856

twizzcast: playing alts is just something for times youve got nothing to do? What if people just like to play multiple classes
But, making a main take 100% and all of the alts 0% means you're not actually playing an alt. Needs to be somewhere in the middle. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/312363571789058049
The point was that we can't offer mains 20% of the content so that folks with 5 characters would have 100% of the content. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/312363354436034560

Doesn't it seem like Valor of the Ancients should trigger when you achieve 1000VP on a realm in a week? Not a specific toon?
Debated that, but it makes you e.g. want to do first dungeon with every alt before playing your main. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/311994309295620097

Professions
Odds on a revamp for fishing and lw? Fishing is slow, tedious, uninteractive; LW requires too many mats for how fast you level
Odds are high, but not for 5.2. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301564257915510786

GC, w/ the recent revamps to leveling profs. I want to level a JC. But should I wait? Any plans to revamp leveling JC?
Not for 5.2 and we haven't decided what profs to focus on for 5.3 yet. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301560030187114496

Are we going to get our filters back in Profession windows? Or new filters? I'd like to separate swords from all weapons.
They need much better filtering overall. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302524147756564481

I don't like the Blacksmithing changes, because it dumbs down another aspect of the game. Farming old ore was easy anyway
Usually players use "dumbing down" to mean less skill required not less time commitment. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/306785893170151427

That new engineering mount, the sky claw. Is it still in there? No mention of it in patch notes.
It's not. We had to pull it at the last second. Hopefully we can fix it and it will return. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/309314696777973761
What about the other engineering items from the 5.2 PTR like the fridge? Are they ever coming out?
We'd like to put them all out together rather than trickling a recipe in here and there. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/309738514419961857

An interesting post popped up this week that demonstrates a solution for game performance during large scale PvP battles. Previously, in large scale PvP, players that were farther away from you were hidden to reduce the load on your client. This led to people that you couldn't see attacking you for several seconds before they became visible. 

Under the changed system, the client can render characters using the normal high res models, low res and much more generic model, and the just nameplates only. Players can set the number of characters to render with a model vs nameplates, as well as the quality of models to be used.
