Dark Iron Dwarf Capital - Shadowforge City
Shadowforge City is now a teleport option when using the Dark Iron Dwarf racial ability, Mole Machine https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/265225-mole-machine in the Battle for Azeroth beta! Upon teleporting to Shadowforge City you will find yourself in an instanced friendly version of Blackrock Depths in the Hall of Crafting. Only a small portion of the instance is utilized for the city including the Grim Guzzler and portions of the upper city. 

Moira Thaurissan https://beta.wowdb.com/npcs/70279-moira-thaurissan is located by the Black Anvil where Lord Incendius https://beta.wowdb.com/npcs/9017-lord-incendius is in the dungeon version. She has a quest called Fer the Alliance https://beta.wowdb.com/quests/51486-fer-the-alliance, which is similar to the other Allied Race quests that give the racial tabards. There is also a mole machine near where you spawn in that can take you right to the Stormwind Embassy which also has a mole machine back to the capital city.

The Story So Far
The Summer Season has bought a mixed bag of continuing dominance and potential redemption stories. In Europe, Method Black & Ascendant have been tussling for the top spot all year long, with Method Black edging ahead with their superior all-round multiclassing ability. Meanwhile the surging Tempo Storm, featuring champion-tier players Alec and Niksi, have found their way back into Europe’s top tier after struggling in the Spring Season. The appropriately named The Move has been to North America what Method Black has been to Europe: ruthless in picking up 480 points out of a possible 540. They’ve blossomed from a Spring Season of missing the cut for the seasonal finals to overcoming close rivals Super Frogs and Method Orange to clinching the top spot for the Summer Finals. We’re half way through the year and BlizzCon looms for all eight of these teams. With Spring Finals winners Reformed out of the running for the Summer Finals, all eight teams in this event are eyeing that BlizzCon qualification spot and a chance to lock themselves in for the Battle for Azeroth.
