Legion - Doomsayers Are Live
One of the smaller parts of the events leading up to Legion is live! You can visit the Doomsayer NPCs located in Stormwind and Orgrimmar to collect their pamphlets to earn the It All Makes Sense Now http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/11065-it-all-makes-sense-now achievement. The Doomsayers only hand out pamphlets every 20 minutes and you can get duplicates, so it may take a while!

Master Loot & Guild Master Loot
Just to clarify, there are more than two loot options here. No one's forcing raids to use Personal Loot, just because Master is off the table. Though I am requesting that people give it a try and let us know what you think, since there have been significant improvements. Or don't. Your choice.

As a player, in my own guild raids, we've used Need/Greed for as long as I can remember, sometimes just passing on contested stuff, figuring out who should get it, and then having them loot it. Uncontested stuff just gets Needed and ends up in the player's hands immediately. It always seemed simpler than manually assigning each piece. But maybe we're weird.

If you aren't a guild group, other Group-Loot-based methods remain available for your use in raids both Need/Greed and FFA. Obviously that opens the door to ninja-looting, which is why I asked about that concern in my first post. But if you aren't worried that one of your friends/guildmates is going to steal something and vanish, then the only loss is the slight of inconvenience people needing to loot items off a corpse, or having someone trade items around to whoever's awarded them. I of course understand the desire to avoid any inconvenience, and we've tried to minimize the impact on static raiding groups, but we feel that curbing harmful uses and abuses of Master Loot in pickup groups is a benefit that offsets those costs.

Update on Ashran
Thanks for making this thread. We're working on getting Ashran back up and running properly and I want to give you an update on some of the issues you mentioned.

1 Maps are not working - mini map and the big map are bugged. if you press M you will see stormshield and not ashran, you will need to click to see the ashran map even then it doesn't always work.
We're working on a fix for this.

2 Rares are like raid bosses now, takes long to kill them, so you cant solo it or with 2-3 people because that can take you 30+ minutes lol
The target item level for PvP templates was set too low. Players were given stats on par with someone in 700 item level gear. We've already bumped that up to 740. This change should help a bit with this problem.

4 When you join, you will need to enable pvp by clicking on ur portrait, everyone will need to do this or healers cant heal you. they can only heal the people who have pvp enabled.
We have a fix in testing for this problem.

5 You cannot bring any premades in, if you try to join someone by grouping up with them you will be thrown in another ashran
We'll investigate this one. It should follow the same behavior as battlegrounds. You should be able to enter with a party of up to 5 people.

6 Legendary rings/Trinkets/Gliders no longer work in Ashran but nukes still work for some weird reason
Engineering toys like gliders will have their functionality restored in a future patch. Sorry no ETA on that. It is a complicated fix. The other items you mentioned are not intended to work.

Not sure how long it will stay this way, but for now this is what is going on in Ashran, you can still play in Ashran the rewards are 200 honor, gold & a box, but you don't really get honor.
We have a fix in testing to change the rewards to a strongbox similar to what you get from a battleground and a Mark of Honor useful for buying old PvP gear sets.

Collecting Appearances
So it seems not all the items you have equipped in the past are showing in the appearances tab. My warrior raided through out wrath, yet not all the sets I collected or weapons I had are showing on him. Also some of the old PvP sets from that era are missing.
You'll only have those appearances unlocked if your Warrior still has those items in their inventory, bank or void storage. If you've long since vendored those items, then their appearances won't have been unlocked.

What was the point in mentioning old quest rewards then? I can't imagine many held onto those? So we can't use them? not good.
Quest rewards should be unlocked as we can track what quests you have completed.

While historically we can see which bosses you've killed and how many times you've killed them, the period of time for which we can check which items dropped, and who got what, is not something we track indefinitely. The same goes for items purchased from vendors.

He got whirlwind axe back though
Yep, because that weapon is a quest reward.

I heard that rewards from removed quests would be added as well. However when I logged my other hunter who's here from vanilla times, it doesn't seem to be the case. Is it the way it should be or they will be added in the near future?
We are aware that some appearances haven't been added, this is something we're working on. If you can remember any specific items you're missing then the best thing to do would be to submit a Bug Report detailing the missing items.

Note: you won't get a reply to bug reports but it will help us hone in on the items. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/417762-appearances-can-be-deceiving/ / Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17612791226?page=2#31

Wardrobe Fill Throttling
Is anyone else having an issue with several items not populating in the wardrobe?
You may have to wait a few minutes upon logging in for things to populate. If all else fails, log out and back in after a few minutes.

If it's gear you had at one point, but no longer have in your Void Storage, bank, etc., then that gear won't be added - those you would need to find again. If it's gear across multiple characters, make sure to log in to every character.

Mythic Dungeon Cap
What is the highest amount of mythic that you can do? I thought it was like Eight, but Im seeing youtube videos of like 10-11?
The system is virtually endless ok, technically there's a cap, but if you somehow reach it we're probably banning you.... Achievements currently go up to +15. Loot currently stops improving past +10, and everything past that is for bragging rights or cosmetic unlocks.

Transport Issues
We've received a few reports about the zepellins and boats not arriving or functioning as they should. We're looking into this now and would like to apologise for any inconvenience this is causing.

For the time-being, please seek portals from friendly neighborhood mages or if you have them unlocked utilise the portals available to some destinations from Orgrimmar/Stormwind.

Blue Tweets
Character / Items
idk if this was answered, but are primal spirits becoming boa/ non bop in legion? 
Not immediately, but we plan to make some changes in a later patch to simplify Draenor crafting. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/752588270429564928

Is it intended that me as a enchant/jeweler are supposed to get scribe recips from bosses as loot? Just got that!
Some recipes are unbound and drop for everyone. Give it to an alt, drop it in the guild bank, or sell it! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/752588108617510912

What's the intent behind Potion of Deadly Grace? It seems to do nothing at all for casters...
Rather than granting stats, it grants a proc that deals extra damage. Numbers will be buffed in the next Beta build. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/752587965650481152

PvE
Will we be able to access the LFR versions of Warlord's raids in Legion like we can with Pandaria's?
Yep, once you level past 100. That will be Seer Kazal's new purpose once Weekly Events move to Legion. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/753347764155711488

a lot of the current nerfs/buffs do not reflect the reality of the power of each class, what data is this based upon?
.Internal and external testing. Remember that during beta, individuals' views of the overall state of things is very limited. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/753116346968408064
Is it fair to balance a spec based on gear they won't have until well over a year into the expansion though?
No; we are not doing that. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/753117247867121664

Will there be a Mistwalker achievment equivalent for Warlords?
No, as mentioned in the original announcement of the Mistwalker title: WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/752603296125194242

Mobs in Legion zones scale just by character level and not item level correct? Some misnformation has been going around.
Legion's world scaling is only based on player level. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/752603588791152640
