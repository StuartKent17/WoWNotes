Mission Complete Addon
If you enjoy Breeze  but want to click even less to go through completed missions, the Mission Complete  addon will go through all of your missions and complete them as fast as possible, outputting the rewards to chat. A similar feature was also added to Master Plan  yesterday.

Class Balance Changes
Blizzard let us know that class balance changes are coming, even for Shaman !
We're aware that shaman DPS is low and are planning to buff it. Source 

Re: class balance - yes, we're planning to make adjustments. Currently gathering data to help us make the right changes. Don't want to under/overdo changes and have to buff/nerf again after.
Honestly hope you aren't just relying on 5ms? Some classes look amazing in 5mans, but won't be margins ahead in raids.
Definitely not. We're looking forward to getting raid data.
PvE or PvP side ?
Both Source 
Will the changes be prior or after initial progression though? choosing which spec to gear is kinda important.
Depends on what you're considering "initial progression." Likely to be after Normal raids open. Need that raid data. Source 
Why do you need that data? You've got MC data, you've got simulations that you guys bragged on at BlizzCon.
A class can have amazing patchwerk DPS and completely suck on raid encounters with actual mechanics. MC data is a tool. Simulations are a tool. We'd like to make use of every tool available. Source 

Now I have another question: are you saying that because you actually got updates on it or is it just to quell us?
They're still in testing and not yet ready to be communicated. Class tuning changes will only be included as a whole package after being tested. Posting half of it will invariably cause unneeded distress. Check back tomorrow. Source 


Patch 6.0.3 Hotfixes - November 24
World Environment

[Requires a realm restart.] The time that corpses persist in the world has been restored back to their former durations.


Dungeons, Raids, and Scenarios

Dungeons

[Requires a realm restart.] Resolved an issue where players were unable to queue through Dungeon Finder while in Warspear or Stormshield.
Upper Blackrock Spire

During the Commander Tharbek encounter, Black Iron Guards no longer join in the fight when he is at 10% health.
Commander Tharbek should no longer be using Iron Axe, Imbued Iron Axe, and Iron Reaver within 4 seconds of each other.
Orebender Gor'ashan's Electric Pulse should now correctly hit players that are standing on a Rune Conduit.
Son of the Beast's Fiery Trail should no longer persist and continue to damaging pets after being defeated.


Items

Miner's Coffee  should no longer be incorrectly applying its speed buff outside of the Garrison's mine.
Swapblaster  should no longer be incorrectly swapping locations with targets other than another party member.



Enchanting - Lack of Draenic Dust
Please fix this profession. It is the only building in my garrison that sits with zero work being done. 

Dust is far too rare, and much to valuable to use on work orders, when the daily cool downs are so important.
As a personal anecdote, my character's Enchanter's Study is experiencing a similar issue with a lack of work orders submitted when the other buildings are humming along with a constant stream of work orders. We feel that Enchanting Dust can be a bit too scarce to come by and are looking at ways to ease those supply concerns.


Blue Tweets
PvP
81,000 Honor Points farmed and not a single Warforged Dagger are they even real? People have them...
Very rare holinka
