Patch notes
Final patch notes are available ! Check them out here  Please note that they are the notes provided with the patch and it doesn't necessarily means that they're accurate, Blizzard already released content patches with unaccurate patch notes in the past and you might want to check in game before complaining about anything.



Existing content changes
Before any question, please read the Patch 3.0.2 FAQ on official forums 

Once this patch is deployed, the following content will be disabled or removed :
The Atiesh quest-chain will not be completable anymore.
The Bear Mount from Zul'aman will no longer drop.
The Onyxia quest-chain has been removed from the game.
Naxxramas is "removed" from the game and moved to Dragonblight. Unreachable until WotLK, obviously
The ability to get titles related to Tier 4 or Tier 5 content is being removed. Of course, players who got them before the patch keep them. Hand of A'dal, Champion of the Naaru

Also, a few things are being changed or added :
Barbershops are now available in capital cities !
Achievements are being added to the game !
The amount of experience needed to level from 60 to 70 has been lowered.
New graphical effects are being added to the game, including the new shadow engine
The Stormwind Harbor will be available, but you won't be able to travel to Northrend until the release of WotLK. However it does have a working boat travelling between Auberdine and Stormwind.
The Caverns of Time have been slightly modified to add an entrance for CoT: Stratholme. The instance itself won't be available before WotLK, only the entrance is being added.
Mounts and Vanity Pets are now trainable spells and the old items will be used to teach you these spells. Once a mount or pet is learned you can access it through the Character Panel. 
Various tokens like Badges of Justice or Honor Points are all merged in the new Token Interface. It will also remove the Badges of Justice and PvP Tokens from your bags to free up even more space !
The in-game Calendar used to schedule raids or events between your friends and guildmate will be available by typing /calendar

Item changes
+Healing and +Spell damage stats are being merged into a single +Spell power stat. Healers' talents and spells have been updated accordingly to compensate this change.
Items with magic school-specific damage like +shadow or +nature have been converted to +spell power as well. This include most of the TBC items except for some enchantments like Sunfire or Soulfrost.
Protection Paladin and Tanking Warrior sets to reflect changes on the new mechanics. A lot of non set items are also being changed. See this post  

Raid changes
Raids buffs, debuffs, and auras stacking have been revamped, please check this post  for more information and our raid composition simulation tool  to see how it works now.
All TBC raid monsters will have their health reduced by about 30%. see this post 
The standard melee damage output will be reduced as well.
Boss abilities remain unchanged, except for Illidan who won't use Shear anymore.
To coincide with the upcoming new talents and mechanic changes for classes in the next patch, we are making some adjustments in existing raid content to provide a smooth transition when the upcoming patch is released. The creatures and bosses in raid dungeons that were introduced in The Burning Crusade will have their health reduced, and most will have their standard melee damage output reduced as well, but their spell and ability damage are not being changed. These changes are being made in all raid dungeons from Karazhan to Sunwell Plateau as well as the outdoor encounters of Doom Lord Kazzak and Doomwalker. On top of this Illidan is also doing his part and will stop casting Shear on players. 



Class changes
Of course, most of the classes spells and talents have been reworked, official patch notes aren't available yet and the latest PTR 3.0.2 Patch Notes haven't been updated in weeks and aren't accurate anymore. Right now your best chance is to check the updated skills and talents list for your class, you can also check the talent calculator

PvP
End of Season 4
We’re currently planning to end the fourth Arena season on October 14, 2008, and as always -- this date could easily change. This Arena Season is only ending in respect to the ladder, meaning we'll be taking a snapshot of the season's ladder and then go through our normal process to determine who is eligible for the end-of-season rewards. This process should take approximately one week. It's very important for players who feel that they may be eligible for the arena-specific title and/or Armored Nether Drake to refrain from transferring their character to another realm between the date outlined above, and when the end-of-season rewards are physically awarded.

Upon the end of this Arena Season, teams and ratings will not be wiped, and will carry forward allowing players to earn points each week and purchase gear until the launch of the expansion November 13, 2008. 


New Arenas
Two new arenas are being added to the game, the Dalaran Arena and the Orgrimmar Arena.

Dalaran Arena
The main feature of the Sewers is a huge pillar of water at the center of the main platform of the arena. The water is activated periodically and will knockback anyone in its way. As long as it's activated you will be able to fight very close to it but you will get knockbacked again as soon as you touch it. Players starts in pipes above the level of the room, to prevent people from staying in these pipes players are automatically "pushed" out of these pipes at the beginning of the match. 


       

Short video preview ;11829470;/fileinfo.html

Orgrimmar Arena
Orgrimmar Arena also has a bunch of interesting mechanics. The first one are elevated platform in various places of the arena, they will go up and down on a non-random timer and will let players fight on higher grounds than their enemies. Also, a strip of fire will be periodically activated at the sides of the arena and will debuff anyone going through it with a DOT inflicting 10% HP damage each tick, lasts 3 ticks. If you ever get crowd controlled in the fire you won't get chain dotted and the dot won't reinitialize itself after the first 3 ticks. Also, please note that teams are starting very close to each other in this map : teams enter the arena by using the two elevators at the center. 


       

Short video preview ;11825799;/fileinfo.html


Honor Rewards
All of the gems that can be purchased with honor will have the Bind on Pickup and Unique-Equipped tags removed so multiples of them can be equipped and they can be traded or auctioned. Also, new epic items are being added to the game :

Cloaks
Spell - Cloak of Certain Reprieve 
Spell - Sergeant's Reinforced Cape  
Spell - Volanthius Shroud 
Melee - The Gladiator's Resolution 

Trinkets
Battlemaster's Courage 
Battlemaster's Resolve 
Battlemaster's Aggression 
Battlemaster's Celerity 

Please note that your honor points or battlegrounds marks are NOT being reset with the patch or even WotLK. 
We had hoped that the introduction of some new Honor rewards in the upcoming patch would give players a great opportunity to spend any of their remaining Honor. However, many players would still be surprised by an Honor and token reset as it isn’t something we’ve done in the past. As such, we've decided to not reset Honor or tokens upon the release of Wrath of the Lich King. Players who save their Honor will be able to spend it on level 80 rewards, although those rewards will be significantly more expensive than their level 70 counterparts. 



Achievements
Achievements are here ! We've got a list of all achievements available for all categories, but if you want to go in depths I guess you can always check Wowhead. Note that Feats of Strength aren't real achievements they won't reward any Achievement point or title / tabard and are only here to reward your for your past success ! 

Most of the achievements completed will award Achievement Points, they are only used as ranking purposes and you're probably going to spend a lot of your free time completing all of them just to have more points than your guildmates.

Inscription
A new profession is being introduced to the game, the Inscription. they can of course create the class glyphs used to improve the spells of all classes see below, but there are also a few more things they can do.

They can create Vellums  used by enchanters to store their enchantments for later use. Basically, this is the item used to sell enchantments at the Auction House.
Inscribers can also make Stats enhancement scrolls  like the Scroll of Strength IV  or any other scroll. They can also create Scroll of Recall  but its use will be restricted to other inscribers. 
And well, Class Glyphs, obviously. 
For more information check the full list of inscription recipes

To create most of their items, Inscribers will need a parchment bought from NPC vendors and Inks. The inks are created with pigments obtained by milling herbs gathered by herbalists. It works the same way as prospecting for jewelcrafters

Alabaster Pigment  - Peacebloom, Silverleaf, Earthroot
Dusky Pigment  / Verdant Pigment  - Mageroyal, Briarthorn, Swiftthistle, Bruiseweed, Stranglekelp
Golden Pigment  / Burnt Pigment  - Wild Steelbloom, Grave Moss, Kingsbloom, Liferoot
Emerald Pigment  / Indigo Pigment  - Fadeleaf, Goldthorn, Khadgar's Wiskher, Wintersbite
Violet Pigment  / Ruby Pigment  - Firebloom, Purple Lotus, Arthas' Tears, Sungrass, Blindweed, Ghost Mushroom, Gromsbloom
Silvery Pigment  / Sapphire Pigment  - Golden Sansam, Dreamfoil, Mountain Silversage, Plaguebloom, Icecap
Nether Pigment  / Ebon Pigment  - Outland herbs
Azure Pigment  / Icy Pigment  - Northrend herbs

Again, for more information check the full list of inscription recipes. If you're in need of a leveling guide I guess you can always check this one  or this one  or even this one 



Class Glyphs
Class Glyphs are a new type of items created through the new Inscription profession, they allow you to change the stats or mechanics of your spells by slightly modifying their stats.

In your spell book, you will find the new Glyphs interface allowing you to access 6 Glyphs :

3 Major Glyphs - Major Glyphs will most of the time modify your spell with powerful upgrades like a damage or range increase, or even additional effects to your existing spells. 
3 Minor Glyphs - Minor Glyphs will mostly provide cost reductions for spells Mana or Reagents and also a few cosmetic changes. 

After buying your Glyph at the Auction House or from an inscriber, you will have to be near a Lexicon of Power to use it this is a forge-like item available near most of the Inscriptions trainer.

When you use a Glyph on a slot, the Glyph is destroyed and the effect added to this slot. You can also overwrite old inscriptions and replace your old effect with a new one whenever you want.

Glyphs are unlocked through leveling and if the Live 3.0.2 version match the Beta one, you should be able to use 2 Major Glyphs and 3 Minor Glyphs at level 70 on live servers, this is still unconfirmed though :

Level 15 : 1 Major / 1 Minor
Level 30 : 2 Major / 1 Minor
Level 50 : 2 Major / 2 Minor
Level 70 : 2 Major / 3 Minor
Level 80 : 3 Major / 3 Minor
