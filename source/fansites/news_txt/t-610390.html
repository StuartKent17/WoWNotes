Hunter - Pet Talent Trees<br>
I don&apos;t think we talked about the new talent trees for the hunter&apos;s pet, but here they are ! Thanks to Axolia for all the work she did on these articles. They&apos;ll be added to the Hunter class pages as soon as possible, for the moment please use the link below.<br>
Cunning (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=808)<br>

Cunning (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=808) | Ferocity (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=809) | Tenacity (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=810)<br>
<br>
Also, Wryxian made a small post about exotic pets on the official forums. <br>
The developers are currently working on the exotic pet talent. Exotic pets are exactly that, exotic and not the average run of the mill pet. But whether this name will stick or not, is uncertain at this point. But these will be a range of new pets with unique abilities, that only those with the talent will be able to tame and train. Where do you get them, well, we&apos;ve not got news on that right now -- perhaps somewhere, exotic! ;-)<br>
<br>
These pets are different from normal pets, but they&apos;re not necessarily more &quot;uber&quot; than others. However they will have access to unique abilities not available to the normal pets that every Hunter can train. A Hunter with this talent will get extra power, but from the talent&apos;s associated additional pet talent points and not necessarily from the exotic pet. <br>
