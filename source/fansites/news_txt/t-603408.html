Blizzard at Dreamhack Winter 2007<br>
We might be covering the dreamhack depending on how successfuly we can get info from people here. I&apos;d say 80% chances that we post something about it. Anyway it&apos;s nice to see some PvP tournaments again ^^<br>
Blizzard will be attending Dreamhack Winter 2007, in J&#xF6;nk&#xF6;ping, Sweden, one of the world&apos;s largest computer festivals. Dreamhack runs from November 29th to December 2nd.<br>

Team changes<br>
Even if the blue post says that 8 US teams will be here, it seems that 4 of these teams declined the offer to participate in the tournaments. European teams have been invited instead and it&apos;s confirmed that mYm.WoW (http://www.mymym.com/wow/) and SK-Gaming (http://www.sk-gaming.com/scene/13527) will be here. (Thanks to Mackelina from mYm (http://www.mymym.com/wow/) for the information)<br>

Reminder : PCNC available in Europe<br>
2 days ago the news got flooded by the tons of 2.3.2 information and I&apos;d say that 80% of the readers didn&apos;t see it. Didn&apos;t change much during the last two days except that there is now a news on the official site, it&apos;s still 8 euros.<br>
Things to Know Before You Start!<br>
The Character Name Change process is not immediate and may take several hours to complete because of the approval process involved. Your character will NOT be available for play during this time.<br>
Each Character Name Change costs 8,00&#x20AC; (&#xA3;6.00). This covers a single name change for a single character.<br>
A character&apos;s name may only be changed once every 90 days.<br>
The name you choose must be available on the character&apos;s realm, and must be within the World of Warcraft Naming Policy.<br>
A Character Name Change cannot be reversed once completed, except by a second name change operation (subject to the above costs and limitations).<br>
Once the name change is completed, your character&apos;s old name will be locked from use on the realm for 90 days. After that time, the old name becomes available again and can be claimed by anyone on its realm on a first-come, first-served basis.<br>
Please review the Character Name Change FAQ for answers to common questions about this service.<br>
The Character Name Change service only allows one change per transaction. If you would like to change multiple character names, you will need to pay for each one separately.</div></div>
