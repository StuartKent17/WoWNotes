Boubouille2007-05-04, 03:41 AMLatest update
Recipes using Jaggal pearl added.

 

Added updated epic faction rewards. I also changed the font I use to make screenshots of item tooltips, it should be a lot easier to read now.
Screenshot of the new stats on Lady Vashj gloves , actually the change was here before today's patch but I forgot to post it ^^
Added major healing glow, not sure if I will do more items changes updates on armor sets/heroic loots, they aren't complete for the moment and it's quite stupid to list tons of items without knowing if they changed or not it would take for ever to check them one by one



Christmas is early this year. New PTR patch changed items, a lot of items, and it's not finished !


The current build has about a third of a soon-to-be very large number of item changes nearly every level 70 epic item in the game is in the process of being updated. Don't base much off of what you see there this weekend.
