2.3 Daily quests<br>
Earlier in the day I noticed that I didn&apos;t post about the new 2.3 daily quests, that&apos;s a big error because this is probably one of the main feature of the 2.3 (You&apos;ll be running them every day !). <br>
<br>
The battleground quests gives marks, gold, and honor.<br>
The dungeon quests give [item=29460] used in Netherstorm to get &quot;free&quot; reputation with one of the following faction (random) : Cenarion Expedition / Consortium / Keepers of Time / Lower City / The Sha&apos;tar / Sporeggar (and people will laugh at you for this one)<br>
The cooking quests give you various cooking reagents and also has a chance to give you one of the new recipe. (See the list in the craft section of the 2.3 information post)<br>
<br>
Update : The 2k honor reward might be wrong, if anyone can confirm/deny in comments I&apos;d be very happy.<br>
Update 2 : 2k honor for the AV daily confirmed, not sure if it changes with the other BGs (but I doubt it). http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/siteImages/images/news/2007/october/pvpconfirm.jpg<br>
Update 3 : The reward still shows up a 209 for some people ... possible PTR bug ? <br>

Season 3 weapon model change / recolor preview<br>
I forgot to update the new skin of the [item=33766] yesterday, so here it is. Also included another recolor preview from Endarion, showing recolored Hyjal blades and ZA guns. (Note that most of this recolor aren&apos;t used in game yet and they don&apos;t mean tons of new weapons, most of the probably won&apos;t even be used, the original model isn&apos;t even used yet)<br>
