Mythic Keystone Dungeons at 7.2 Launch
With the release of Patch 7.2, we’re increasing the difficulty of and rewards from Mythic Keystone Dungeons. To help you prepare, we’d like to provide some clarity on what those changes entail.

After Patch 7.2 has been released, the minimum item level of the rewards found in the end-of-run chests will be as follows:


Mythic 2-3: 870
Mythic 4-5: 875
Mythic 6-7: 880
Mythic 8-9: 885
Mythic 10+: 890


Note: bosses in Mythic Dungeons run with no Keystone active will drop item level 865 gear.

The minimum item level of the rewards in the weekly Challenger’s Bounty chest found in your Order Hall will be based on the highest difficulty Mythic Keystone dungeon you cleared that week, as follows:


Mythic 2: 875
Mythic 3: 880
Mythic 4: 885
Mythic 5: 890
Mythic 6: 890
Mythic 7: 895
Mythic 8: 895
Mythic 9: 900
Mythic 10+: 905


So, if you clear a Mythic dungeon using a level 6 Keystone after the patch is released, you’ll see gear of at least item level 880 at the end of the run, and will get a piece of gear with an item level of at least 890 in your weekly chest. Keep in mind that the difficulty of the dungeons themselves is increasing to match these rewards.

As we transition from Patch 7.1.5 to Patch 7.2, you’ll get a lower-level Keystone with the reset this week than you may otherwise be expecting. This is due to the increase in difficulty of these dungeons in Patch 7.2. For example, if you completed a level 9 Keystone in patch 7.1.5 and then were given the usual level 6 Keystone next week, that’d actually be an increase in difficulty. To avoid this, we’re making these adjustments for this week only to reduce the level of Keystone you receive based on what you’ve completed this week:


Mythic 2-8: level 2 Keystone
Mythic 9-10: level 3 
Mythic 11: level 4
Mythic 12: level 5
Mythic 13-14: level 6
Mythic 15: level 7


each difficulty level above 15 increases next week’s Keystone level by 1

As to the gear you’ll find in your weekly chest, its item level will still be based on the highest dungeon you complete this week, but the rewards will be based on the new 7.2 scaling. To put it more directly: completing a Keystone dungeon of difficulty 10 or higher this week will result in a reward with a minimum item level of 905 in your next weekly chest, which is the current maximum reward in Patch 7.2.

We hope this helps clear the air on what you can expect from Mythic Keystone dungeons next week, as well as what you’ll find waiting for you in your Challenger’s Bounty chest. Good luck!

Could you clarify whether this starts on Tuesday eg. no point in pushing a +15 key this week if +10 is the cap again or the Tuesday after?
This coming Tuesday, the 28th.

Preparing for the Dungeon

Once inside the scenario, you cannot leave or you'll have to start over.
The scenario is somewhat time-consuming, so be prepared to spend at least a half hour inside.
Most battles are against Beast type pets, so Mechanical pets will have a clear advantage.
You should bring an Aquatic pet for the final boss, Budding Everliving Spore http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/116795-budding-everliving-spore, due to his Elemental type.


Consider adding these pets to your team:

Iron Starlette http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/77221-iron-starlette, Darkmoon Tonk http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/55356-darkmoon-tonk or Darkmoon Zeppelin http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/55367-darkmoon-zeppelin - All solid mechanical pets with excellent movesets.
Mechanical Pandaren Dragonling http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/64899-mechanical-pandaren-dragonling - A great Mechanical pet that will be useful versus the Growing Ectoplasm http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/116794-growing-ectoplasm, which uses Magic type moves and is weak to Dragonkin moves.
Anubisath Idol http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/68659-anubisath-idol - This pet's dominant stall strategy with a decent Mechanical attack is effective against most pets.
Emerald Proto-Whelp http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/68850-emerald-proto-whelp - It can outlast pretty much any other pet.
Zandalari Anklerender http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/70451-zandalari-anklerender - Its Black Claw http://www.wowdb.com/pet-abilities/919-black-claw + Swarm http://www.wowdb.com/pet-abilities/706-swarm combo is effective against most low-quality pets, but the Anklerender may struggle against Son of Skum http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/116789-son-of-skum.
Pandaren Water Spirit http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/66950-pandaren-water-spirit - A great pick for its high aquatic damage and valuable stun versus the final boss, Budding Everliving Spore http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/116795-budding-everliving-spore.


Getting to the Dungeon

Visit Breanni http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/96479-breanni’s Magical Menagerie in Dalaran http://www.wowdb.com/zones/7502-dalaran Broken Isles and speak with either Lio the Lioness http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/98725-lio-the-lioness Alliance or Serr’ah http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/115287-serrah Horde.
Pick up A Call from the Caverns http://www.wowdb.com/quests/45540-a-call-from-the-caverns and head to the skull-shaped rock above Wailing Caverns to find Muyani.
Alliance players can get to Ratchet by taking the portal in Dalaran to the Shrine of the Seven Stars http://www.wowdb.com/zones/6142-shrine-of-seven-stars and then speaking to Gleep Chatterswitch http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/71336-gleep-chatterswitch and paying her 10g. She is located outside on the Summer Terrace, near a teleporter.
Horde players can take the Orgrimmar http://www.wowdb.com/zones/1637-orgrimmar or Thunder Bluff http://www.wowdb.com/zones/1638-thunder-bluff portal from Dalaran and fly over.
Once you’ve arrived at Wailing Caverns, fly up into the left eye of the dungeon's skull. Talk to Muyani, Disciple of Naralex http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/116781-muyani and accept Wailing Critters http://www.wowdb.com/quests/45423-wailing-critters.
Speak with her again to be teleported into the scenario. You will not be able to start the scenario by zoning in to Wailing Caverns.

Stage 7 - Defeat the Budding Everliving Spore http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/116795-budding-everliving-spore Elemental, Legendary, Boss. His Acid Rain http://ptr.wowdb.com/pet-abilities/1051-acid-rain + Dreadful Breath http://ptr.wowdb.com/pet-abilities/668-dreadful-breath combination will do a high amount of damage if the fight goes on too long. Acid Rain will also cause Aquatic abilities to do more damage, so with a quality Aquatic pet you’ll be able to dispatch him relatively quickly.
With the successful defeat of the Budding Everliving Spore http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/116795-budding-everliving-spore, return to Muyani to turn in the quest and receive your reward: Ultimate Battle Training Stone http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/122457-ultimate-battle-training-stone.
