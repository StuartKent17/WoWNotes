Classes

Developers’ notes: All of the damage increases below are a combination of buffing specs that don't benefit from the Netherlight Crucible's item level increase as much as other specs, as well as tuning the specs relative to each other.

Vault of the Wardens

Fixed a bug preventing Inquisitor Tormentorum’s associates from automatically engaging players.



Tomb of Sargeras

Demonic Inquisition

The number of Echoing Anguish debuffs has been reduced to 2 was 3 on Raid Finder, Normal, and Heroic difficulties.

Kil’jaeden

[Hotfix in testing] Reduced the health of Kil’jaeden, Erupting Reflection, and Shadowsoul by 5% on all difficulties.
[Hotfix in testing] The maximum distance from the center of the platform that Armageddon can spawn has been reduced on all difficulties.
[Hotfix in testing] The radius of the explosion from Bursting Dreadflame has been reduced on all difficulties.
[Hotfix in testing] Chaotic Eruption damage and knockup has been reduced on Mythic difficulty.



Player versus Player

All specs that received general damage increases above have been reduced by an equivalent amount in PvP, as the Netherlight Crucible’s item-level increases to the player’s Artifact weapon have very little impact on PvP.
