Patch 5.4 - Timeless Isle<br>
The Timeless Isle was opened today and we took a quick look around tonight: <br>
<br>
<br>
You will receive an item in the mail that will teleport you to the Isle, allowing you to learn the flightpath there.<br>
Next there is a one time quest (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/33161-a-timeless-tour) that sends you all over the Isle to explore it, before heading back (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/33156-time-keeper-kairoz) to the Celestial Court in the center.<br>
The Celestial Court has the four Aspects world bosses in the center, with many of the NPCs from Mists of Pandaria around the outside.<br>
You can purchase the new aspect pets (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/battle-pets?filter-patch=3388&amp;filter-search=Aspect&amp;filter-bp-source=4) here for 3 x http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/101529.jpg Celestial Coin (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/101529-celestial-coin), which are a reward of the tournament that requires 30 level 25 pets to enter.<br>
There are no flying mounts (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/145389-temporal-anomaly) on the isle!<br>
Most NPCs, objects, and gathering nodes scattered around the isle drop Timeless Coins (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/777-timeless-coin), as well as the pet battle (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/33222-little-tommy-newcomer) and lore daily quests (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/33211-a-timeless-question). <br>
Timeless Coins (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/777-timeless-coin) are used to purchase Timeless Caches (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=3388&amp;filter-search=cache&amp;filter-ilvl-min=496&amp;filter-ilvl-max=496&amp;filter-quality=16) for 7500 x Timeless Coin (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/777-timeless-coin), which reward item level 496 gear (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/armor?filter-patch=3388&amp;filter-ilvl-min=496&amp;filter-ilvl-max=496&amp;filter-quality=16), similar to Battlefield: Barrens. You can also buy Mogu Runes (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/752-mogu-rune-of-fate) for 2500 x Timeless Coin (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/777-timeless-coin).<br>
You can also buy http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/101538.jpg Kukuru&apos;s Cache Key (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/101538-kukurus-cache-key) for 500 x Timeless Coin (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/777-timeless-coin), which will open any chest in Master Kukuru&apos;s cave. These chests contain Timeless Coins and other minor loot. <br>
There is a http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/104014.jpg Pouch of Timeless Coins (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/104014-pouch-of-timeless-coins) that costs 500 Valor Points as well, presumably rewarding you with even more Timeless Coins. <br>

Patch 5.5<br>
It sounds like Patch 5.5 is still a possibility, with Dave Kosak mentioning that future changes to Orgrimmar will happen in another patch before the next expansion.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Raid Testing Schedule - July 19<br>
On Friday, July 19, we will continue testing raid encounters in the Siege of Orgrimmar raid. We&apos;re proceeding with 10-player Normal testing, and will then move on to Heroic and then 25-player mode as the PTR cycle progresses.<br>
<br>
Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below for all Public Test Realms.<br>
<br>
Friday, July 19<br>
<br>
Spoils of Pandaria - 10 Player Normal - 10:30 PDT (13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST)<br>
Thok the Bloodthirsty* - 10 Player Normal - 16:00 PDT (19:00 EDT, 01:00 CEST)<br>
<br>
<br>
*Depending on the status of a couple of bugs, we may test another encounter in place of Thok.<br>
<br>
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br>

Patch 5.4 PTR Patch Notes - July 18<br>
General<br>
New Area: Timeless Isle<br>
<br>
A mysterious island, lost for millennia to the currents of time, has emerged from the mists off the eastern coast of Jade Forest.<br>
Players seeking to explore the Timeless Isle should check their mailboxes, where a Curious Ticking Parcel awaits. Unwrapping it will set you on the first step of your new adventure.<br>
The Timeless Isle is inhabited by all manner of strange and powerful creatures that will test the mettle of solo explorers, but great rewards await the brave and skillful: epic loot, bind-to-account gear, Mogu Runes of Fate, pets, mounts, fun toys, and much more.<br>
The Isle is filled with secrets and mysteries, many of which dynamically become available to explorers. Keep an eye on your minimap while on the Isle for information on nearby events!<br>
The Timeless Isle is home to five new world raid bosses! Players may face each of the four Celestials in a trial of combat. <br>
Heroes who have earned the legendary cloak from Wrathion may access the sanctum of the fiery Yaungol demigod Ordos, atop the Timeless Isle.<br>

Legendary Cloak and Ordos<br>
Just as an update to this:<br>
<br>
We&apos;re planning to change the restriction for access to Ordos to be account-wide. Basically, as long as at least one of your characters has a legendary cloak, all of them should be able to access the encounter.

Timeless Isle Feedback<br>
No more quests after the first one to explore.<br>
Note that the Timeless Isle is largely a self-directed experience, which diverges somewhat from our recent practice. You aren&apos;t going to find a hub of daily questgivers or NPCs who will assign you specific tasks to complete. There is a ton to do on the Timeless Isle, and countless secrets to discover, so go explore!

PvP Gear vs PvE Gear<br>
The problem with that approach is that whenever there is an alternative way to get the same or similar gear, players will generally always choose the easiest/fastest route, even if that goes against their own personal enjoyment of the game; obviously that is something we would like to avoid and should be able to avoid with good design.<br>
<br>
If you&#x2019;re a serious raider and you dislike doing PvP, you&#x2019;ll probably feel left behind if the rest of your guildmates go into arena to complement their PvE gear, and vice versa in case you&#x2019;re into PvP and dislike PvE.<br>
<br>
I think these two groups are different enough to warrant a gear distinction, I believe that is good design. Can the current system be improved? Certainly, there are many things that are far from ideal, we&#x2019;ve tried quite a lot of new ideas for PvP in MoP, some of those ideas were quite radical and we know that there&#x2019;s always some risk attached to anything that&#x2019;s drastically different and new. We made some mistakes, and we learned a lot from them, we&#x2019;ve reverted some changes and we&#x2019;ve tried a few new approaches and as time goes on the system will keep on maturing.<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s also important to remember that new expansions will always give us much more leeway when it comes to design shifts. It&#x2019;s very important to keep a certain level of consistency during the course of an expansion, even when you have a great new idea, if that idea is too radical, sometimes it will be better to wait for a new expansion before deploying it in order to avoid alienating and confusing the players. <br>
There are certainly some things that we would do differently if MoP were to launch today. But frankly, I think MoP had (and will have) some of the most drastic changes I&#x2019;ve seen during the course of any expansion, and 5.4 is really really packed! <br>
I must say I&#x2019;m quite excited and curious to see how 5.4 will play out on live and see how players will take some of the new features.<br>
<br>
simple fixes like even ilevel balance?<br>
Fixing ilvls is super simple, fixing everything that depends on those ilvls however is not. That&#x2019;s where the complexity begins, the whole game is like an intrinsic vast web of connections, every change that you apply will send out a wave of repercussions that we have to &#x201C;fix&#x201D; somehow. Some of these will be easy, others hard, and some we won&#x2019;t even be expecting.
