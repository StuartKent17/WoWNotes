Mists of Pandaria Talent Calculator Unofficial Patch Notes
What kind of site MMO-Champion would be if we left you with a bunch of picture and a couple of "ok, shit changed, go figure it out!"? Not a very good site, I tell you. 

That's why my wonderful and slightly crazy moderators worked all day to bring you an almost complete list of changes since what we've seen at Blizzcon! But before we jump aboard the class changes train, a word of warning from the best safety advisor out there, Bashiok. 
We wanted to take a moment to give some context to why the calculators were posted, and the permanence of the data shown. A lot of times we say things like "not final" and "may change" as verbal wiggle room should we decide we need to go a different direction, or are unable to complete something in time. In this case of the Mists of Pandaria calculator data is essentially pre-alpha, and will absolutely change in many ways.

It was important for us to get this stuff in front of you as soon as possible though and as a work in progress as it is to get your feedback, which will in no small part influence that change. We also wanted to present everything on a single page to give you a fuller context for the initial talent changes we announced at BlizzCon, and to see how the overall structure of core abilities, spec abilities, and talents will function, with concrete examples.

The calculator contains elements that are experimental, still in the process of implementation, or in some cases outright failed experiments that we already intend to revise or replace. Odds are good that if it looks like we’ve forgotten some critical piece of a particular class toolkit, it’s either accounted for elsewhere, or simply a data glitch e.g., Prayer of Healing is currently absent from the calculator – we are not taking Prayer of Healing away from priests, and Devastate for warriors probably won't sunder armor 453%. Our hope is that revealing the calculator in this state will shed light on the philosophy behind our talent overhaul, and let you get a sense of how pieces of your core rotational gameplay, such as Hot Streak, Riptide, or Sudden Doom, fit into the new system.

The different classes are also at very different stages of design and implementation, and the fact that some mechanics changes we discussed at BlizzCon and in recent Q&As are not yet present does not mean that we have abandoned those ideas.

Any and all feedback is very welcome, but please keep all of the above in mind when considering the information in the talent calculator, and please keep feedback consolidated in the Mists of Pandaria forum: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/2592425/

And now, the super awesome list of compiled changes, thanks to all the moderators who worked on that including Simca http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/545200-Simca, Malefic http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/525040-Malefic, Madgod http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/559801-The-Madgod, Migari http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/546785-Migari, Radux http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/546665-Radux, and many others who are going to hate me because I forgot to mention them!
