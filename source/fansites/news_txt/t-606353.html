A nice change has been made to the official site, http://beta.worldofwarcraft.com (http://beta.worldofwarcraft.com/) is now working ! Well it&apos;s not really working, but it&apos;s effectively redirecting people to http://beta.worldofwarcraft.com/game/character-copy.html (http://beta.worldofwarcraft.com/game/character-copy.html) on the server. Before yesterday it was only showing a 404 error, this could be the sign of an imminent opening of beta signups and it wouldn&apos;t be the first time something like this happens, the Wrath of the Lich King website was &quot;detected&quot; a few days before the Blizzcon using the same method.<br>

Frostmourne Replica auction closed - Highest bid reaches $20,700!<br>
A few days ago the Frostmourne Replica Auction (http://www.weaponmasters.com/auction/) has been closed, and the two highest bid were respectively ... $20,700 and $20,600 ! The 3rd bid only reached the ridiculous amount of $12,000. I personally find it a bit overpriced for a sword, even if it&apos;s Frostmourne, but that&apos;s probably because I&apos;m a hunter and I don&apos;t really use my melee weapons right ? <br>
<br>
You can see the top 100 bidders on Blizzplanet.com (http://blizzplanet.com/news/2256/)<br>

US-Proudmoore (http://us.gorgonnash.info/realm/Proudmoore) players are the first to reach the Phase 3 of the offensive on Quel&apos;Danas ! This will let them rebuild the anvil and access the new heroic badges rewards (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=5548.0#post_swisle) ! Congratulations to them.<br>
Watching the realm progress and wanted to give a shout out to all the Proudmoorians and their success thus far in taking back Quel&apos;Danas! The Shattered Sun Offensive is surely impressed by your efforts.<br>

02/04 Spotlight - BattleHeat<br>
The focus of our latest World of Warcraft Spotlight is Blacksmithing, not the profession in-game, but one of the oldest crafts and a major cornerstone in building our modern world. While the profession has been around for a long time it still has much to offer us and a small dedicated group of &#x201C;real life&#x201D; armor blacksmiths inspired by the World of Warcraft universe were eager to show the community just how much.<br>
<br>
We interviewed a member of the German workshop group BattleHeat, and talked about the creation of a paladin armor set, the challenges they face and their ideas for the future. Discover the heat of the battle and the ancient art of blacksmithing!<br>
