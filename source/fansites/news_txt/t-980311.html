Continued from part two: Well of Eternity.<br>
<br>
Hour of Twilight<br>
<br>
Having shattered the infinite dragonflight and recovered the fabled Dragon Soul, Thrall and his allies must now journey to Wyrmrest Temple and rendezvous with the green, blue, red, and bronze dragonflights. Reaching their destination will be an arduous endeavor: the Twilight&apos;s Hammer has amassed its forces near the temple, determined to intercept the Dragon Soul at any cost.<br>
<br>
The final stage in this series of dungeons is set in the present-day Dragonblight, now under a full invasion by the Twilight&apos;s Hammer. Players must escort Thrall and the Dragon Soul safely to Wyrmrest Temple, where the assault on Deathwing is to commence. But the Twilight&apos;s Hammer forces are numerous, and their leadership remains strong. Those attacking the temple are commanded by a man known very well for the strength of will he&apos;s offered Alliance citizens. Now with his own will broken, he preaches only Deathwing&apos;s cataclysmic vision for all life on Azeroth.<br>

Excerpts from the Dungeon Journal<br>
<br>
Arcurion: Horde and Alliance assaults against the Twilight&apos;s Hammer have slaughtered many of the cult&apos;s fearsome elemental ascendants. One exception is Arcurion, a formidable water ascendant tasked to slay Thrall and retrieve the Dragon Soul. Should this twisted elemental being succeed, nothing will be able to stop Deathwing from ushering in the Hour of Twilight.<br>
<br>
Asira Dawnslayer: Former blade-for-hire Asira Sunbright was initially leery of working for the Twilight&apos;s Hammer, but the cult&apos;s generous payments quickly won her over. In time, she succumbed to the corruptive influence of her dark employers, even going so far as to take on the name Dawnslayer. As one of the cult&apos;s deadliest assassins, Asira has been called upon to exterminate Thrall and his comrades.<br>
<br>
Archbishop Benedictus: Archbishop Benedictus is the revered leader of the Church of the Holy Light. For years, his wise guidance has been instrumental in seeing humanity through bleak times. Yet beneath his apparent benevolence lies the shocking truth that Benedictus has pledged himself to the eradication of all life on Azeroth through the agency of his dark master... Deathwing.<br>
<br>
This world has already lost too many good people. While inhabitants of Azeroth have been betrayed by their most trusted leaders and advisors, others have betrayed their own ideals and morals in search of a higher, albeit calamitous, cause. The time has come. You must act on behalf of the Dragon Aspects as a minister of war, battling the twisted future echoes of today&apos;s greatest leaders, subverting ancient armies of the Highborne and Burning Legion, and risking your very life to make certain the Twilight&apos;s Hammer doesn&apos;t intercept Thrall&apos;s most coveted possession. Your mission will take you beyond the bounds of time. You&apos;ll see Deathwing&apos;s preferred outcome for Azeroth -- an outcome through which even he won&apos;t survive. You&apos;ll witness the event that began the first Sundering of the world, 10,000 years prior to the Cataclysm.<br>
<br>
All of this you&apos;ll do to bring back into existence what would appear to be a simple disk&#x2026; an object all but forgotten over the ages. This is the beginning of the last stand against Deathwing.<br>
<br>
Stay tuned for a preview of the patch 4.3 raid: Dragon Soul.<br>
