Patch 6.1.2 Hotfixes - May 7
Raids and Dungeons
Blackrock Foundry

Blackhand

Blackhand's Demolition http://www.wowdb.com/spells/156425-demolition ability now deals 20% less damage and his Massive Demolition http://www.wowdb.com/spells/156479-massive-demolition ability now deals 5% less damage on Normal, Heroic, and Mythic difficulties.



Patch 6.2 - PvP Trinket Cooldown Reduction
We're currently planning to change the on-use PvP trinkets back to a 1-minute cooldown and reducing their effects in patch 6.2. This is effectively reverting the change made to these trinkets in patch 6.1, which was a heavy contributor to the overall strength of the Human racial.

This essentially buffs sub rogues in addition to the buffs they are receiving, along with BM hunters who will now just run 1 on use and 1 proc again.
It does mean that classes with burst abilities on shorter cooldowns will be able to line them up with trinkets more regularly, yes. However, it substantially lowers the maximum potential for that burst of damage. We expect it will be significantly easier to survive through the maximum burst output of e.g. a Beast Mastery Hunter or Combat Rogue who is able to run with double trinkets. That was the case prior to the change in Patch 6.1 that changed them to their current 2-minute versions.


Patch 6.2 Preview - Bonus Events and Adventure Guide
Blizzard posted a list of the bonus events from last week's PTR build http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4865-Patch-6-2-PTR-Build-19953-April-28th-Hotfixes-Upcoming-Raid-Testing-Blue-Posts. It looks like many of the rewards have been changed since then.
As development continues on Patch 6.2, we’re excited to share some additional information on two new upcoming features—Bonus Events and the new Adventure Guide.

Bonus Events
The Bonus Events system consists of a rotating schedule of seven different activities, currently scheduled to run from Friday through Monday of each week. Each Bonus Event grants a passive bonus to a particular game activity and offers a once-per-event quest with a noteworthy reward for accomplishing a related goal. The in-game calendar located in the upper right-hand corner of the mini-map can serve as your one-stop reference for the event schedule. The Adventure Guide—discussed in detail below—will also offer a direct link to active Bonus Events, allowing you to easily accept any associated quests.

Timewalking—The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King
The schedule will feature two different Timewalking Bonus Events, each themed around an expansion: The Burning Crusade or Wrath of the Lich King. Your character’s level and gear scales down to the dungeon at Heroic difficulty, but the loot you receive is scaled back up, making it a great way to gear up characters as well as receive cool items for transmogrification. Completing three Timewalking dungeons as a part of a quest during the event awards a Seal for an extra bonus roll, which isn’t counted toward the weekly cap of three seals. Learn more about the Timewalking Bonus Event in our Patch 6.2 Preview – Timewalking http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/18710308/.

Draenor Dungeons
While this Bonus Event is active, defeating enemies in any Draenor dungeon will award reputation with an appropriate faction. Completing two Mythic-difficulty Warlords dungeons as a part of a quest during the event awards a Heroic Hellfire Citadel Raid cache.

Battlegrounds
During the Battlegrounds Bonus Event, you’ll earn triple Honor points from random Battlegrounds. Completing the event quest by winning a few random Battlegrounds awards 500 Conquest Points, which do not count toward the weekly Conquest cap.

Arena Skirmishes
You’ll earn triple Honor points from random Arena Skirmish matches during this event. A quest to win several random Arena Skirmish matches will award 500 Conquest Points, which do not count toward the weekly Conquest cap.

Apexis
If you’re trying to stock up on Apexis Crystals, you’ll be able to gain triple the amount from eligible creatures during this Bonus Event. Completing three area assault objectives during the event awards a sizable amount of Oil to fuel new Naval Missions as a part of your Shipyard. More information on this new resource will be covered in a future Shipyards and Naval Missions preview.

Pet Battles
During Pet Battle Bonus Events, you’ll be able to take your pets out for a little exercise and earn triple pet experience from battles. Winning five PvP Pet Battles as a part of a quest during the event awards the player with an Ultimate Battle-Training Stone that instantly levels a pet to 25.

Adventure Guide
Patch 6.2 also introduces the Adventure Guide, which acts as a landing page of sorts for our other in-game Journals, and makes it easier than ever to find content and activities that are relevant to your character.

The Adventure Guide suggests content based on a number of factors, such as character level, item level, quest progress, achievements, and more. The Guide is fully interactive, allowing players to accept relevant quests or search for a group via Group Finder with a single click.
