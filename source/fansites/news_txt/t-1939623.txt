Is it intended to have multiple Power Word: shields on a player at the same time? i.e. I have PW:S from myself on me. and I have PW:s from a different disc priest on me.
That's intended. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Why did you take heat as a ret paladin nerfer? They were so faceroll OP in WOTLK pvp.
I often joked about nerfing them and somehow that started being taken seriously. OccupyGStreet 

As worlds in games get bigger, it seems they also become more empty, What can we as players and devs do about this?
Maybe devs have to give players more tools to create their own content. OccupyGStreet 
Doesn't even need to be new art or dungeons. Being able to offer other players quests could be huge. OccupyGStreet 

not sure if you have had a chance to see proposed tank changes to Legion alpha but ur take on it would be appreciated
They make sense to me. Defeating a boss should be a team affair. OccupyGStreet 


Legion - Waywatcher's Boon
If you have ever wanted to become a moose, Waywatcher's Boon  is your chance. It grants increased movement speed for 15 seconds, but only in Val'sharah.
