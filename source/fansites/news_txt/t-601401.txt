Important : If you're getting virus alerts from the patch from the Blizzard downloader or from here, it doesn't matter, please read this post https://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=110636194&sid=1 on the official forums.
We've been in the process of investigating this issue and we have been able to confirm that this is indeed a false-positive detection by a few anti-viruses in regards to the Blizzard Downloader. The Blizzard Downloader, which is used to download patches, does not contain a trojan, virus, or other malicious code.

We have been working directly with many anti-virus companies to resolve this, some of which have already deployed updated virus definitions that resolve this error. We recommend updating your definitions if you've received this false positive related to the Blizzard Downloader, and that you continue to check for updates as a resolution should be available soon if it is not already.

Don't forget that even if this warning is false, it doesn't mean that all of them are. Don't go retarded with your antivirus thinking that you're safe. You're never safe on the interweb, the bad guys, they're watching us, everywhere.
