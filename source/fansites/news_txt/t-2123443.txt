PTR Build Deploy - 11/28/2016
Greetings all,

In a few moments, the PTR realms will be coming down in order to deploy a new 7.1.5 build. No ETA for today's push however I'll update the thread if things look like they're going to take longer than usual >6 hours. 

I'll leave this thread open for discussion so long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines.

Thanks for your patience!

Greetings PTR friends,
Things are taking a bit longer than expected with this push. Realms are still up with the previous build, so expect some downtime tomorrow when the deploy starts up again. 

Thanks again for your patience!


Kirin Tor Emissary Quests
Just a quick note to say that there was indeed an issue over the weekend with Kirin Tor Emissary being active, but not enough Kirin Tor quests being available.

We deployed a hotfix yesterday that automatically gives completion credit for the Kirin Tor Emissary upon logging in.

This a temporary fix, we're resolving the underlying problem so that next time the Kirin Tor Emissary is active there will be enough Kirin Tor quests available to complete the Emissary Quest.

Apologies for the understandable confusion and frustration this caused.


Blue Tweets

Did they? Not that I'd seen. But regardless, not fixing the bug or realizing its severity is on us. WatcherDev 
None of us is happy with this outcome; but our mistake doesn't excuse or justify others'. WatcherDev 

Hey, is the TCG considered canon to WoW?
Nope! It's more like a mini-game played within WoW, hence the Innkeeper telling you all of these great stories Muffinus
