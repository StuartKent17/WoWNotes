Kirin Tor Tavern Crawl Micro-Holidaykttc<br>
The Kirin Tor Tavern Crawl (http://ptr.wowdb.com/world-events/646-kirin-tor-tavern-crawl) is a micro-holiday that sends players to different taverns around the world. <br>
<br>
<br>
You can join the currently active tavern from a new NPC in Dalaran (Tipsi Wobblerune (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119045-tipsi-wobblerune) or Anebria Sunwine (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119088-anebria-sunwine))<br>
After some time the group moves along to the next Tavern. You can press the last call button or take the portal to move on.<br>
If you get left behind on the tavern tour, you can catch up by speaking to the mage in the current tavern you are in. <br>
Each location has drink and food that you can interact with. The food will grant a well fed buff.<br>
There are also additional NPCs in each tavern enjoying the holiday.<br>
You can click on the discarded packages to apply one of many unique hat models for four hours. <br>
