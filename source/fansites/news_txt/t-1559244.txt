Get to Your Choppa! - Claiming Your Mount
The Horde chopper is on its way, and you need to log in now to claim it!


 

Your votes for Azeroth Choppers were counted, and one factionâ€™s war cry roared loudest: the Horde bike will now be turned into a mount in World of Warcraft! Anyone who logs in to the game between now and September 30, 2014 will automatically have their account flagged to receive the Horde chopper upon the release of the upcoming Warlords of Draenor expansion. Everyone can and should! claim their chopper by logging in now, but as a reminder, only your Horde characters will be able to mount up and take it for a ride.
