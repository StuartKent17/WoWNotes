Spells Being Taken off the Global Cooldownglobal
Several abilities are being removed from the global cooldown!
I believe it was Ion that said in a dev chat movement abilities were coming back off the GCD. So is this actually happening?
This is something that is still happening. Here is the list I have so far of abilities that are for sure coming off the GCD:

Havoc - Vengeful Retreat
All Druids - Wild Charge
Arms - Charge
Fury - Charge
Protection Warrior - Ignore Pain
Protection Warrior – Intercept
Protection Warrior PvP – Dragon Charge
Survival – Harpoon Source https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/37795/8


Well that’s nice I guess, what about all the other categories?
This is just what we have confirmed so far. There could potentially be more added to the list, but I personally just don’t know of any others yet.

We’d love to hear from you guys on more examples of abilities that you feel should be off the GCD and why. Source https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/37795/17


New Warfront - Battle for Darkshoredarkshore
A new warfront is being introduced to go alongside with the Battle for Stromgarde. This warfront continues the story of the Night Elves after the loss of Teldrassil and their fight to reclaim Darkshore from Horde control. Check out our preview below and for more information on how the cycle will work, refer to Blizzard's official preview https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8194-Patch-8-1-Background-Downloader-Preview-Battle-for-Darkshore-Blue-Posts!

Warfront Rewards Vendorwarfrontvendor
Patch 8.1 adds a new currency called 7th Legion Service Medal https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1717-7th-legion-service-medal / Honorbound Service Medal https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1716-honorbound-service-medal. These are acquired from Warfronts as well as Incursion World quests and can be spent at a vendor near your Warfront table in your capital city.

Warfront World Questswarfrontwq
Arathi Highlands now has a variety of world quests added to it instead of just the world boss quest. In addition, Darkshore also has many world quests. These are most likely available to the faction in control of the map.

Night Warrior Scenarionightwarrior
The Night Warrior scenario is a new series of quests that advances the story of the Night Elves after the events of the Burning of Teldrassil. Both Horde and Alliance have separate scenarios to tell the sides to the story. Alliance venture into Darkshore with Tyrande while the Horde attempt to resurrect fallen Night Elves with Nathanos, culminating in a showdown that leads to the Darkshore Warfront.

Faction Assaultsfassaults
Much like the Legion Invasions from the Legion expansion, Tides of Vengeance adds new limited time world quests that cycle between each faction defending or attacking an area of Zuldazar or Kul Tiras. If your faction is defending, you finish the Faction Assault by completing four of the world quests and then attacking the opposing faction's air ship. These are also a new way to level alts as characters 110 or above can complete a Faction Assault and receive the Taste of Victory https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/166792-taste-of-victory buff for an hour after completion.

Paragon Reputations for Battle for Azeroth Factionsprep
The Paragon Reputation reward system is returning from Legion for the Battle for Azeroth factions. Every 10,000 reputation you earn past exalted will now reward you with a container that can contain fun rewards!

Island Expedition Rewards Update
Patch 8.1 will change Island Expedition rewards from being based on the NPCs you kill to the NPCs that are on the island. 
In Tides of Vengeance, in addition to two new Island Expeditions, we’re making a number of adjustments and improvements to Islands. One of those changes will alter how various cosmetic rewards are determined, and we’d like to explain that further, as we promised here: https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1065080683058487297

Currently in Battle for Azeroth, Island Expeditions have a chance to reward cosmetic items based on which type of creatures you and your team defeated. For example, if the island theme of the week was Hozen, there’s a chance to receive one of the Banana toys. If the invaders were Nerubian, you could have a chance to receive the Voru’kar Leecher companion pet among other things. They way this has worked is by means of a hidden scorecard that counted your group’s efforts against anything on the island that was part of the invaders’ ecology. So if anyone in the group earned some Azerite from killing invaders or mining Azerite near the invaders, everyone in the group had a chance at the cosmetic rewards. That chance grew based on how much invaders’ Azerite was obtained, and was also a higher chance in Heroic and even higher in Mythic difficulty Islands. We set the maximum chance you could earn at a reasonable threshold, in the hopes that players wouldn’t feel that they needed to only kill invaders and not complete the islands in a natural way.

Of course, that’s not how it worked out. Confusion around the best way to get cosmetics led to a divergence in playstyles, with some players wishing to focus exclusively on hunting specific creatures, while others wished to win the island efficiently to get Azerite. This caused a significant amount of tension between players who had differing goals.

In Tides of Vengeance, all players on an Expedition will have a chance to receive cosmetic rewards based on the island’s inhabitants, rather than which enemies were specifically defeated. That chance will again be higher on higher difficulties, but there will be no need to strategize around invaders. The most efficient way to receive cosmetic rewards will be whatever tactics cause you to complete the Island quickly, on the highest difficulty that you’re comfortable.

Thanks to everyone who has stormed our high seas with feedback on this. We really appreciate it.

It’s time to martial your menagerie and put your best battle pets forward within the halls of Gnomeregan.

To get started on your journey, you’ll need to have earned the achievement All Growns Up! https://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/6570-all-growns-up, which requires you to raise a pet to level 25. This will make a new quest available to you from Radek Fuselock https://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/147641-radek-fuselock, who is located near the pet battle trainers in Dazar’alor, or Tizzy Gearjolt, who is located just outside of Dana Pull’s shop in Hook Point in Boralus. You won’t need to complete the Wailing Caverns or Deadmines pet battle dungeons to gain access, and with the release of the Tides of Vengeance content update, you’ll be able to play the three pet battle dungeons in any order.

Completing the quest and pet battle dungeon the first time earns you an Ultimate Battle-Training Stone https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/122457-ultimate-battle-training-stone. You’ll also be able to avail yourself of Manapoof’s aid to teleport directly to Gnomeregan’s dungeon entrance as a part of the quest reward.

For those daring to push your team, you can take on the Challenge Mode version of the dungeon, which requires you to have at least 15 maximum-level battle pets. This will open an account-wide weekly quest that you can pick up from Micro Zoox, who’s waiting outside the Gnomeregan instance portal.

Completing the Challenge Mode the first time will grant the achievement Pet Battle Challenge: Gnomeregan https://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/13269-pet-battle-challenge-gnomeregan, which rewards a Mini Spider Tank https://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/147838-mini-spider-tank battle pet. Return each week to complete the quest and you’ll earn the reward Pristine Gizmo, which can be exchanged for items from Micro Zoox including an Unopened Gnomeregan Supply Box https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/165839-unopened-gnomeregan-supply-box, Mechanical Cockroach https://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/147671-mechanical-cockroach, Schematic: Mechantula https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/165844-schematic-mechantula, Leper Rat Tail https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/165855-leper-rat-tail, and Rechargeable Alarm-O-Dog Battery https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/165857-rechargeable-alarm-o-dog-battery.

Whether you’re new to pet battle dungeons or a companion-combat veteran, you’ll want to get in on the ongoing story as it unfolds. Who are the shadowy figures that keep appearing? What do they want? What are their nefarious plans? Discover what awaits your critter pals next in Gnomeregan!
