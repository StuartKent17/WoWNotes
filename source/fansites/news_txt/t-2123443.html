PTR Build Deploy - 11/28/2016<br>
Greetings all,<br>
<br>
In a few moments, the PTR realms will be coming down in order to deploy a new 7.1.5 build. No ETA for today&apos;s push however I&apos;ll update the thread if things look like they&apos;re going to take longer than usual (&gt;6 hours). <br>
<br>
I&apos;ll leave this thread open for discussion so long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your patience!<br>
<br>
Greetings PTR friends,<br>
Things are taking a bit longer than expected with this push. Realms are still up with the previous build, so expect some downtime tomorrow when the deploy starts up again. <br>
<br>
Thanks again for your patience!<br>

Kirin Tor Emissary Quests<br>
Just a quick note to say that there was indeed an issue over the weekend with Kirin Tor Emissary being active, but not enough Kirin Tor quests being available.<br>
<br>
We deployed a hotfix yesterday that automatically gives completion credit for the Kirin Tor Emissary upon logging in.<br>
<br>
This a temporary fix, we&apos;re resolving the underlying problem so that next time the Kirin Tor Emissary is active there will be enough Kirin Tor quests available to complete the Emissary Quest.<br>
<br>
Apologies for the understandable confusion and frustration this caused.<br>
<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
was mentioned, as well as numerous bug reports from our guild. Exorsus and From Scratch reported as well and reported as well<br>
Did they? Not that I&apos;d seen. But regardless, not fixing the bug or realizing its severity is on us. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/802918311583330304))<br>
None of us is happy with this outcome; but our mistake doesn&apos;t excuse or justify others&apos;. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/802918544526561281))<br>

Hey, is the TCG considered canon to WoW?<br>
Nope! It&apos;s more like a mini-game played within WoW, hence the Innkeeper telling you all of these great stories (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/803014841870917632))<br>
