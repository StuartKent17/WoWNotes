Heroic Loots<br>
Added the location on the Gauntlets of Dissension. The list should be fairly complete now based on what&apos;s available on Wowhead, but there will probably be more on the next update.<br>

Ogri&apos;la<br>
Did an edit on the last news, but will re-add it here too. The Ogri&apos;la (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=233) page now look like ... Ogri&apos;la. <br>
<br>
The webmaster sucks<br>
Sorry for the late update today, I managed to crash a power supply and explode another one in the same day. If I forgot to answer a mail or a MP about something just send it again, it&apos;s kinda hard to keep tracks of what I&apos;ve done today.</div></div>
