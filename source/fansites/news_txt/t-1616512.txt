Warlords of Draenor - Vicious War Ram
Today we are taking a look at the Vicious War Ram  This is the new Alliance PvP mount in Patch 6.0.2, sold by Necrolord Sipe  for Vicious Saddle  If you don't already have a saddle, you can get one from the Primal Combatant  achievement when Warlords of Draenor launches.

Group Finder Listing Cap Increased
One of the bigger complaints about the group finder was the cap of 25 groups visible at once. This was increased in a hotfix to 100 groups. Right now that still won't cover the ~150-200 groups listed during the evening, but you can refresh the list or search to narrow down the results.


  


Free Game Time Promotion
If you are thinking about coming back for Warlords of Draenor, a free week of game time went out today. It appears to work for many players right now, even adding a week of game time to active accounts.

EU players may need to try twice or look under the Referrals & Rewards section in their WoW account in account management.

Alliance and the Wickerman
I asked one of our designers @Muffinus if he knew why it was set up this way. The original designer that worked on it isn't here any more so we're not sure if more changes were planned but didn't get made, or what, but he agreed there's some obvious inconsistency with it versus the Alliance Wickerman. It's not something we can hotfix or get changes into a patch that would release before this year's holiday is over, but in the future, guard rage will be significantly reduced, and it will no longer flag you for PvP when entering the area.

Brown Orc Skin
We do think offering some other skin options is a pretty cool idea Dark Iron dwarves? Brown orcs? but our priority is still the updates to the features that already exist--the blood elf update is in-progress--as well as prioritizing some tasks based on feedback to all the model updates that went out in 6.0.2.

PvE
With the current situation with UBRS being level 100 only, is there any way to get attuned to BWL for those who weren't?
You should be able to just use the orb no matter what. Inability to do as a ghost is a bug that's being fixed. WatcherDev 

PvP
when forming pvp group finder cannot que while still looking. Bug or working as intended?
This is intended. holinka 
hmm sad face. I spent 20 minutes with a terribad today without the ability to find a replacement.
Perhaps something we'll consider in the future but didn't want people joining groups but looking for another one. holinka 

does the trinket bonus even do anything for you anymore? resilience is out of the game right?
We just aren't putting it on new gear holinka 
so getting it right now is worth it? the res still works?
Yes holinka

Why do Alliance players have to flag for pvp and face level ?? guards to do the wickerman quest?
Because it is a PvP quest. Horde players have one as well. _DonAdams 
Horde players don't have to flag because the Alliance wickerman is outside the city. Going in ruins of lordaeron forces flag.
Hm... that's an oversight. On a PvP realm you're flagged either way. Sadly, I don't see a fix for PvE realms this year. _DonAdams 


The Horde Chopper is Here
Patch 6.0.2 added the Horde Chopper, but no word on when the Alliance Chopper is going to show up yet.
With the recent release of Patch 6.0.2, players who logged in to claim their Horde chopper between July 24, 2014 through September 30, 2014 can now get on their bike and ride. The Warlord's Deathwheel can be found within the Mounts tabShift-P in collections and can be ridden by Horde characters with the appropriate riding skill.
