Onyxia solo-kill ... again
A few days ago I posted about a video showing a solo-kill http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=8012.0 of Onyxia. We had a lot of reactions in comments about it, people complained how it could be staged and about the hunter used as a safety net during the encounter. 

Well good news, a new video has been published on Warcraftmovies http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=77021, this time from a paladin, and we definitely have the full length video of a solo kill here. I know that's 2 onyxia-related news in the same week, but I'm sure we all love to revive old memories http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvIYRrgZ04.

Leveling in WotLK
As you know we made changes for the 20-60 experience, and more changes could happen, but until we see how things play out a bit more with the addition of the expansion, there isn't anything specific I can tell you in regard to more changes just yet.

Death Knight Creation
As long as you have a level 55 character on a server, you will be able to unlock the death knight create one. There will be a questline associated with the death knight, however, so that you may learn how to play it and get into the storyline associated with them.

Adding new classes to the game / Death Knights
Nethaera made a fairly long post explaining why Blizzard picked the Death Knight as the first class to be added in the game. She also mentions that Blizzard is definitely not going to rush the addition of more classes. 
Here's the skinny, the lowdown, the 411 etc on the death knight choice.

First off, it fits in with Northrend extremely well for obvious reasons.

Second off, many people tend to have this strange belief that adding a new class is simple, easy as pie, and a cakewalk all on a Sunday afternoon, but it's not. There is a lot of work that goes into it and many considerations for how it will work, how it will work with other classes, how the lore ties in, how quests and npcs also can tie in to this new class, itemization, and a whole lot more. It takes a lot of forethought, testing, and care to add something this major to the game and for each new class that is added to the game, come the concerns about not maintaining the uniqueness of each class that already exists.

I'm not saying that the possibility of more classes being added in the future isn't a possibility. We had many ideas of what class we'd add in for Wrath of the Lich King prior to settling on the death knight. There are many more possibilities for classes we'd consider in the future as well, but we aren't going to rush to add them in and risk creating a situation where other classes lose their uniqueness and their value within the game.
