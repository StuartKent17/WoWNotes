We are currently planning to end Arena Season 6 as early as August 25. At that point we will go through our normal process to determine who is eligible for the end-of-season rewards. This process should take approximately one week. It&apos;s very important for players who feel that they may be eligible for the arena-specific titles and/or Furious Gladiator&#x2019;s Frostwyrm to refrain from transferring their character to another realm until after Arena Season 6 ends.<br>
<br>
The following Arena Season will not begin for at least one week after the current season ends. During this time between seasons, all rated matches will be turned off and only skirmishes will be available. When Arena Season 7 begins, all team ratings, personal rating, and arena points will be wiped, but matchmaking rating and honor points will remain. <br>

Ozzy Osbourne: Live on Stage at BlizzCon<br>
Ozzy Osbourne, the only mortal to openly challenge the Lich King&#x2019;s claim to the title &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; and survive, will take the stage live at Anaheim Convention Center to rock the closing ceremonies of BlizzCon 2009.<br>
<br>
Although tickets to the convention sold out in minutes, you can still join in with the &apos;BlizzCon Virtual Ticket&apos; live Internet stream or via DIRECTV Pay Per View. The Virtual Ticket will feature 18 hours of BlizzCon coverage, including Ozzy&#x2019;s live performance, as well as the BlizzCon 2009 exclusive in-game pet: Grunty the Murloc Marine.<br>
