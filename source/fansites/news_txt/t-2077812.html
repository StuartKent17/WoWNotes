Patch 7.1 - Trial of Valor: Guarm<br>
Guarm is the second boss in the Trial of Valor raid. <br>

Helya&apos;s vicious three-headed hound stands guard at the gates of Helheim. Bred to require neither comfort nor sleep, Guarm remains ever-watchful for any invaders who come to challenge the reign of his cruel mistress.<br>
<br>
<br>
Overview - Guarm&apos;s Guardian&apos;s Breath (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227573-guardians-breath) unleashes three elements: Fire, Nature and Shadow. Guarm gains a stack of Frothing Rage (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/228174-frothing-rage) for every player not hit by one of his breath attacks.<br>

World Quests<br>
World quests in dungeons. Yay: a different dung this wk, they drop loot even if you are not on WQ. Having trouble getting people to do them? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/777695719847137280))<br>
Asking because we have had problems in the past with incentivizing side bosses and quests. If not enough incentive, what needs to be added? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/777696076983709700))<br>
usually if you have higher Ilvl tank/healer in the group I&apos;ve found it hard &quot;don&apos;t need it so not doing it want speed&quot;<br>
what do you think would incentivize that player? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/777697631556374529))<br>
<br>
I&apos;m down to do these but cmon don&apos;t have them come out in the middle of the week when we&apos;ve done them. Tuesdays only please?<br>
I think a better fix is to make it less painful to do the dungeon again, e.g. more rewarding. Dungeons are fun! IMO. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/777697241628745728))<br>
<br>
Did you do the weekly raid quest in WOTLK? E.G. Kill the extra giant before the gunship in ICC. How would you improve on this concept? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/777698808708739072))<br>

PvP<br>
Is there a way to find out exactly how gear works now in PvP? I&apos;d really appreciate it good sir!<br>
Sure! In battlegrounds, arenas and Ashran, we set everyone&apos;s stats like they are wearing 850 gear. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/777028445918208002))<br>
We look at your average item level and for everyone 1 point above 800, we increase your stats by 0.1%. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/777028693461839872))<br>
<br>
is Mercenary Mode meant to not be up all the time for Horde? I got it once, queued 2 BGs then the vendor disappeared<br>
If queue times get low enough it goes away. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/777368467779354624))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
We resisted adding herd animals for hunters for a long time because there was no &quot;grass&quot; food. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/771084185821782017))<br>
We considered just letting them &quot;graze&quot; wherever without you having to feed them. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/771084271171743744))<br>
<br>
Do you think Legion or the intended purpose of Legion can fix the problems that Blizzard had in WoD like content drought<br>
I have no insider knowledge or anything. I think the biggest difference is they are saying they are no longer trying to do the expansion a year thing, so hopefully they can put all of their effort into making sure players never go too long without something new.<br>
<br>
Even back when I was there, we tried to ship expansions faster, which sometimes meant focusing less on the current expansion in order to shift all resources to the newer one. But then when we missed our dates, it just meant players had those long droughts. I think it&apos;s great that rather than being stubborn, the team is trying a different, and very player-focused strategy. I hope it works for them.
