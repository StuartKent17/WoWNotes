Warlords of Draenor - No Realm First Achievements<br>
As mentioned in the Patch 5.4 Dev Interviews (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1345), realm first leveling and profession achievements won&apos;t be added for Warlords of Draenor.<br>

Battleground Honor Increases Coming Tuesday<br>
We now have a date for the battleground honor increases (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3809-Battleground-Honor-Increase-Stat-Squish-System-Changes-Blue-Posts-Tweets-Fan-Art).<br>

Battle.Net Desktop App Chat<br>
We recently got some updates on chat in the Battle.Net Desktop App (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3273-Battle-net-Desktop-Client-Services-Activated-and-Beta-Test-Opt-in) and the Appear Offline mode (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/236762-appear-offline-option-coming-soon-to-battlenet/) from a while back. <br>
<br>
A recent update to the client removed one of the older chat display styles, added and tweaked avatars, modified some chat related things, and removed the Beta label.<br>
<br>

<br>
If you&apos;re an astute observer, you&apos;ll note from various postings on the internet that there is indeed chat functionality inside the client, but it is disabled.<br>
<br>
The reason why it isn&apos;t enabled is simple. The servers aren&apos;t ready to handle it yet.<br>
<br>
Having said that, chat will be ready soon(tm)<br>
<br>
Better answer would be &quot;chat is not ready yet&quot; than &quot;servers can&apos;t handle it&quot;<br>
You&apos;re right, poor choice of words. Chat was definitely not ready, but it is closer now.<br>
<br>
The problem with the chat system was related to when you&apos;re logged into multiple games at the same time. For purposes of this discussion, Battle.net app is considered another game. <br>
<br>
See who is online (You&apos;ll need friends for this). In a future update (coming soon) you&apos;ll be able to chat with them too. (Source (http://us.battle.net/en/forum/topic/11882868485?page=3#55))<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
Classes<br>
&quot;We want to reduce the amount of buttons required to play and make the game easier for players who come back.&quot; WHY DUMB IT DOWN?<br>
Reducing the number of buttons required is not the same as dumbing it down. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438159423291154433))<br>
<br>
More behind the scenes of class design:There are hard many parts of designing a spell, but most people wouldn&apos;t guess one of the hardest. Naming it. Giving a spell a good name is paramount. It has to be representative, awesome sounding, appropriate, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438547225858154496))<br>
One of the most difficult things is resisting the urge to use &quot;Divine&quot; or &quot;Holy&quot; on a Paladin/Priest spell, *again*. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438549783825772544))<br>
<br>
Keeping 100% uptime on DOTs and performing a filler rotation is not engaging. Intelligently using procs is<br>
Intelligently using procs isn&apos;t going away. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438432424498716672))<br>
Don&apos;t mistake snapshotting&apos;s removal for procs not benefitting you. Procs&apos; effects are just restricted to their duration now. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438432720398462976))<br>
if that is the case are we looking at dynamic updating of DOTs in Warlord&apos;s?<br>
Yes, that&apos;s what removing snapshotting is. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438435463133556736))<br>
Since it Dynamically updates there&apos;s no other point. Basically DoT classes are boring now?<br>
No, pretty sure you&apos;re misunderstanding something fundamental. DoTs are updated on every tick, not when they wear off. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438542098623504384))<br>

Art<br>
will you update the character login backgrounds along with the new models? The UD one is very outdated. Thanks!<br>
I agree those need some love, maybe not at same time as characters but its something we&apos;ve wanted to do for a while now. (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/431843557784047616))<br>
<br>
Hello good sir, with the new character model updates in WoD i was hoping to see an option for long beards for my casters!<br>
cool idea, not adding extra options with this pass, hope to do so in the future. (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/431842694055198720))<br>
<br>
Proving Grounds<br>
Any plans for handling scaling of CMs/PGs different in WoD? Scaling down 120 ilvls makes classes play very differently.<br>
We&apos;re investigating the potential of scaling PGs up to your ilvl. Not a guarantee, just an investigation. Has Pros/Cons. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438039015468437504))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Will most classes only have one viable spec for pvp (like warriors) in WoD? would be easier to balance?<br>
It is a decent goal for classes that only have one role, but not for classes that have multiple. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/433439167754694657))<br>
<br>
Can you implement the SotA bomb extra action button in IoC as well?<br>
Yes eventually. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/431843409372790784))<br>
<br>
you know why resi should be in gear? Smooth resi scaling. Suddenly added big resi feels bad. Takes time for gear to fix.<br>
Certainly true. But the whole player base doesn&apos;t gear at the same rate, specifically ungeared players entering the game. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438796918185938944))<br>
<br>
Was leaving resilience on heirlooms an oversight? Maybe it could be replaced with something more useful?<br>
Resilience is on all lower level gear (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438796576505335808))<br>
<br>
why didnt you reset mmr?<br>
We don&apos;t reset MMR because it is system designed to match up players of equal skill. We do reset inflation however. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438429905701720064))<br>
