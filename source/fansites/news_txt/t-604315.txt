Boubouille2008-01-16, 09:29 AMNothing really new today, but a few interesting things to check if you've got some free time. Yes, I'm aware that there is a screenshot with supposed Sunwell loots screenshot fake http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/sunwellfake.jpg Link added because of the tons of requests I got in mail :/, but they're a fake from private servers, you can stop mailing it to me. We're still accepting mails if cookies are included though

2.4 News ... soon.
Blue posters are surprisingly inactive lately, however we got our weekly "2.4 news are coming soon" post. 
The Blizzcast is now out and we are working on compiling information on the Under Development for patch 2.4 to give everyone updates. It takes some time to do, but we will be updating before long. I'm sure what everyone is really waiting for are the actual patch notes, but you'll have to wait for those to hit the test realm.

Today's posts aren't really informative, but they might answers questions that people are asking themselves.

Incgamers' UICentral Trojan Infected
Update : Rushster has since moved the file to a separate server to avoid this happening again. If you'd like to read more about the issue, see the thread on Incgamers here: http://wowui.incgamers.com/?p=mod&m=2106 http://wowui.incgamers.com/?p=mod&m=2106.

Cairenn, an admin of WoWInterface.com http://www.wowinterface.com posted this thread http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3881821845&postId=38813235984&sid=1#0 on the official forums to warn users about a potential trojan in the latest version of incgamers'UICentral the tool used to auto update your mods.

4:07:58 PM Shirik: So here's the deal. UI Central is packaged with a program "patcher.exe" which has code in it to go download an "update.exe" from a non-incgamers site
4:08:05 PM Shirik: update.exe is then immediately run
4:08:51 PM Shirik: update.exe proceeds to install itself as wzcsvbc.dll
4:10:01 PM Shirik: It installs that from a remote site if possible, and if that fails it will instead use its own copy
4:10:26 PM Shirik: It then registers itself with lsass.exe so that it can be resident at every startup while remaining hidden
4:10:43 PM Shirik: After all that's complete, update.exe attempts to delete itself and shut down

Now luckily for everyone in one sense it is the same one as showed up previously. Therefore, we already know how to get rid of it. 

If you're using this software, I suggest that you read the whole thread http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3881821845&postId=38813235984&sid=1#0 and check your system to make sure it's not infected.
