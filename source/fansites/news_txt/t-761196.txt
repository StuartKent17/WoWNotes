Boubouille2010-09-18, 07:34 AMUpdate
07:00PM CEST - Someone very smart pointed out something very disturbing. Worgens already had Darkflight http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/68992/darkflight/, a temporary speed spell applying a Mod Speed to the character. So, why did Blizzard add that spell in this build?



Running Wild http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/87840/running-wild/ - Drop to all fours to run as fast as a wild animal.


This spell doesn't apply a mod speed, and applies a "Mounted" aura to the player. It's a racial, and it's apparently a Level 20 spell. I don't want to say it yet, but that would explain why we never saw a model for the Worgen Mount.

12:00PM CEST - Added Maelstrom continent map.
11:25AM CEST - All classes changes are now available.
10:00AM CEST - Added Racial changes, added Mounts & Companion Pets.
09:35AM CEST - Added Player and Guild Achievements
