Mythic Blackrock Foundry Progression
Four guilds are already at 7/10 bosses down, with just a little over a day of progress. You can find lots of discussion in our Raids and Dungeons forum progression thread 


  


Argi Raises More Than $1.9 Million
It looks like Argi  didn't sell quite as well as the Cinder Kitten  $2.3 million or Alterac Brew Pup  $2 million.


  



  

Thanks to the overwhelming generosity of World of Warcraft players around the world who purchased the Argi pet, weâ€™ve raised a total of more than 1.9 million USD to support the ongoing Ebola relief efforts in Africa by the Red Cross. In December, we announced that for every Argi  purchased by December 31, 2014, 100% of the adoption fee would be going to assist in aiding in the fight against this deadly disease -- and the community embraced this cute little intergalactic nibbler, helping out a great cause in the process. Thanks again to everyone who helped make a difference.

Tab Targeting Issues
I want to tab to the nearest enemy and instead it picks a target off in the middle of nowhere
Hrm. That sounds like a bug to me. We can take a look. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Raid Loot Itemization
Itemization isn't necessarily a science of providing the absolute optimal stats at all times for your character, but usually as an art of creating a progression path throughout the game. In any case though once you've bested Highmaul you'll want to move on to Foundry, and to your point, progress by equipping new items and becoming more powerful. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Solo Boss Testing
So if you are not familiar with X-Men, the danger room is a room where they simulate fights. Wouldn't it be cool if we could test our specs/talents on individual bosses without having to get an entire group and, instead, have something like the proving grounds but we could select which boss we wanted to fight. I think that would be nice.
That's kiiiiind of what Brawler's Guild is though, right? Not that you get to select the boss, but seems like it offers that same gameplay. Or do you mean actual raid bosses? Hrm, being able to practice against real raid bosses might pose some issues, specifically for world first kill races, but ... y'know also that seems like it'd kind of cheapen the bosses a bit to me. Might be a lot of work just to be able to sim a fight when it'd probably be a better experience to just be improving and progressing in the raid itself. I don't know, interesting idea to chew on at least. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Character / Items
will there be another change wave to BRF trinkets like there was for any 6.0 trinket or are they final?
No changes are currently planned but we will be watching out for any that may need adjustments. WarcraftDevs 

Will Stage 3 crafted items retain their color shift if an iLvl 680 upgrade token is used?
There are currently no plans to visually change items that go from stage 3 to stage 4. WarcraftDevs 

PvE
What are the requirments to get into mythic BRF will the raid need to have killed heroic blackhand ? Thanks
No boss kill requirements necessary. Mythic will be locked for the first week, then open to anyone after; same as Highmaul. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
Just did an AB, 5 healers horde vs 0 alliance. Thought this was supposed to be impossible within the WoD system.
seeing uptick in reports on this. Should be rare. Will investigate. holinka 

Holy Prism often breaks my Polymorph in arena, since it bounces to nearby enemies. Is this intended or a design flaw?
Intended. It's designed to do damage to other enemies in the immediate area. WarcraftDevs 

Garrisons
Are the BRF garrison missions going to be available on Tue/Wed this week? Or only when 6.1 goes live?
Blackrock Foundry missions will become available after Patch 6.1 goes live. WarcraftDevs 

does deactivating a follower strip the gear?
As others have said, follower upgrades will remain after being deactivated/activated. WarcraftDevs 
We should also mention you can upgrade followers who are currently deactivated. = WarcraftDevs
