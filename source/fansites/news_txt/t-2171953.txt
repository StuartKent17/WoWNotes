Warlock and Paladin Class Mount Quest Requirements
I posted this in the main thread, but cross-posting it here for visibility - we'll be re-examining the rare material requirement for the Paladin and Warlock class mounts, we don't want the gate for these to be an expensive tradeskill material. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

FEEDBACK: Class Mount Questlines + Flying
Reposting this from my other thread in here, so hopefully the blues can see it: 

So, as an avid lore junkie, I couldn't help myself, and decided to do as many of the mount campaigns as I could on the PTR. I've been loving them so far. But then I stumbled on the Death Knight one. It's very engaging, from a fantasy stand point it's my favorite, but there are a few gleaming lore inconsistencies that go against the main plotline of Cataclym.

-The Ruby Sanctum is perfectly fine: This is the big thing, that the red dragonflight, and probably by extension all the others, have their sanctums. In the book Twilight of the Aspects, Korialstrasz sacrifices himself to destroy all of the sanctums, because the Twilight's Hammer was using their eggs to create more twilight dragons. I could maybe understand if it were another sanctum, but the Ruby Sanctum was specifically the one that Korialstrasz saw, which prompted his decision to blow it up. 

-Vyrastrasza has whelps: If we get past the fact that we're in a Sanctum that shouldn't exist, there's another glaring problem. The large wyrm in the middle, Vyrastrasza, has whelps. If we go by the provided timelines by Blizzard in Legion and other expansions, dragons are in their whelp stage for around two years. However, the end of the Cataclysm heralded the Age of Mortals, causing the dragonflights to lose not only their titanic powers, but also their ability to reproduce. This was highlighted in the Dawn of the Aspects novel, where Alexstrasza is in a deep depression as the last of her eggs hatch. Now, suddenly, there's a newly created brood mother making eggs! Problem solved? Only it goes against all established lore.

Hope I don't sound like too much of a nut here, but these problems seriously trouble me, I am really hoping that there is someone who is actively checking storylines for continuity. Thanks for reading!
Thanks for your interest in the Death Knight story! The new Lich King certainly has some... unique requests.

To answer your lore questions, the whelps you see here, as Senegos mentioned, are likely the last whelps we will see, unless the dragons figure out a way to make more eggs. Some dragons are still in whelp form, though, as they have not matured yet.

The Ruby Sanctum itself was destroyed by Krasus, but some of the dragonflights have chosen to rebuild their sanctums. As you see in the Death Knight quest, the Ruby Sanctum has been completely regrown, and has no traces of any lingering twilight influence. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Marksman Hunter Tier 19 Set Bonus
I'd like to highlight to the Dev team that currently, on live, the Marksman hunter T19 4pc tier bonus has the effect of decreasing the damage done by Piercing Shot by 15%. 
This is a bug. Piercing Shot should be affected similarly to other spells, where the cost is changed by the bonus but the damage isn't. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

MW Monks and Mythic Raiding
Much like the Disc post in the other thread, Mistweaver is more in a state of thinking ahead for possible refinements, but no immediate shake-ups. This is preliminary, but a possible direction is that some things could be smoothed out by reducing the emphasis on Essence Font. That could help with, for example, drawing out more of a regular ongoing decision between Enveloping Mist, Vivify, and Effuse, rather than having that so often pushed out by Essence Font. Also, making the value of mastery more stable, and reducing the importance of churning as much mana into Essence Fonts as possible. For fair warning, a cooldown on EF is not out of the question after seeing how it's played out, but that would come alongside seeing how other heals might have to be strengthened.

Rising Thunder has wound up underperforming which we would likely look at at the same time. It would likely be helped regardless by changes that made it easier to spend mana and GCDs on Rising Sun Kick, without always taking away from something like an Essence Font.

Assassination T20 Set Bonus Feedback
The 2-piece will get some single-target benefit. That said, part of the benefit of the bonus is the improved multi-target capability that Garrote has with a shorter cooldown. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Shaman Class Mount Feedback
Thanks for the feedback! In the next PTR build, elemental will be fiery, and enhancement will be stormy.

We are also making changes to the resto version to make it more watery, and remove the strobe effects.

Is anything going to be done to reduce the movement of the mount? Looks like I won't be able to use it due to the same sea sickness effect the sky golem causes.
Will investigate, thanks for mentioning it! Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 


Build of the Month - February 2017
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

All of the parts on this page are Amazon affiliate links. When you purchase your parts through them it helps support the site!

This month
The current SSD prices  are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale.

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 7700K and would get more performance from spending that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions!
