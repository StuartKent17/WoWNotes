Updated Features

Artifact Knowledge and Class Hall Updates
New Bind-on-Account items are available from the Artifact Researcher in your Class Order Hall. These items can be sent to alternate characters to immediately get them to higher Artifact Knowledge levels.

For new players just reaching 110, there is a new set of repeatable quests that will allow you to immediately exchange Order Hall Resources for Artifact Knowledge up to Artifact Knowledge level 15.

The time it takes to complete Class Hall research has been reduced. A shorter time to complete Class Hall research for Tiers 3, 4, 5, and 6 will make it easier to upgrade your Class Halls on alts and new characters.

Find Premade Groups from the Quest Tracker
When you’re looking for players that are doing the same World Quest, you can now easily search for groups in the Quest Tracker. For group quests, a small button will appear next to the quest name. For all other quests, right click the quest name and then click “Find Group.” This will automatically launch a search for groups of players who are doing that quest. If none are found, you can start a group with one click – all the details will be filled in for you.

More Group Finder updates:

A new option allows you to make groups only visible to friends and guildmates of people in the group.
When searching for groups, groups who need your role based on your active specialization are sorted to the top of the list.
You will receive a more descriptive message when you are declined when attempting to join a group that is full.
