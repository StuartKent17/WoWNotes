Upcoming "The Crowd Chose You" Hotfix
We're going to take another look at Necrotic Strike's healing absorb and whether or not we feel it should be affected by Dampening. We get that the absorb is the bulk of the ability's "damage", but there is still some concern that it would be too strong. We're also discussing double Rogue. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Cata dungeons and heroics were not difficult... I don't understand this idea that they were.
For matchmade groups, some like Stonecore and Grim Batol were deadly. Very low success rates. That's data, not an opinion. Source 
It's funny. Early Cata heroics are why me and my whole guild came back. Catas launch raids and heroics were so much fun!
There is a place for hard content for organized groups of friends. The Cata problem was that was the only content. Source 

World Firsts aren't accurate representations of avg. play experience; better to look at more breadth.
In fact world firsts are specifically fights while severely undergeared, which nobody else will be. Source 

people who come out saying they are clearing raids too fast/easy. whats your thoughts on dbm helping push through faster?
I'm sure it helps, but so do videos and strategy guides in general. Overall, we're happy with SoO balance at the moment. Source 

Game used to avoid caling "damage" role silly illetirate "DPS", but it crept in in Norushen DJ and Wrathion's challenge. How?
It's tough. At some point you're using different terminology than most players actually use, so it gets awkward. Source 
I think about this problem a lot. Source 

Tank queue abuse is getting bad, can people queued with tanks who leave immediately be kicked automatically?
That should happen today overall. If you don't abuse it often, the system is more forgiving. Source

I know people are looking forward to character models, but I just wish night time was actually night 
The artists are aware of this feedback and want to try and address it in the future. Too dark is hard to play of course. Source

It's funny you say this. I am not participating in Shaohao rep grinding because the return for the effort invested is horrible
It is intended to be optional. Source 


Crowd Control & Diminishing Returns
We've seen some confusion recently about exactly which crowd control effects share diminishing returns. To hopefully clear that up, we're providing the following, categorized lists of all of the CC effects in the game. 

For those who may be unaware of how the Diminishing Returns system works, here's a brief explanation: After you've been affected by a crowd control effect in PvP, there's a 15 second window for diminishing returns. The second effect of the same category as listed below that is used on you will only last for 50% of its normal duration, and the 15 second window will be restarted. Should you be affected by a third effect from the same category inside that window, it will only last for 25% of its initial duration. The 15 second window will once again be restarted, and you will be immune to any further effects of that category for the duration.

The lists below have been separated out into their specific diminishing returns categories. Each ability shares diminishing returns with the other abilities it has been listed with, and no others.
