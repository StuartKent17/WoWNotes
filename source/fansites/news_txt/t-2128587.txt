Class Halls

Players who were unable to submit Artifact Knowledge Work Orders should now be able to again.


Dungeons and Raids

Players in a dungeon during a server shutdown should no longer receive the Deserter debuff.


Throne of Tides

Fixed a bug that was causing Mindbender Ghur’sha to be non-interactable.


Trial of Valor

The Patient Zero achievement should now be obtainable, as intended.


Guarm

Increased the radius of Guarm's Multi-Headed from 8 yards to 30 yards on Mythic difficulty.
Decreased Guarm's health by 5% on Mythic difficulty.


Developers’ Notes: The Mythic difficulty change to the Multi-Headed mechanic is intended to require the use of 2 tanks on the encounter. We also slightly reduced Guarm’s health alongside this change in order to minimize the effect on groups that were accustomed to only using 1 tank. This is already active in the NA/ANZ region, and will take effect in other regions with their weekly restarts.

Helya

The magnitude of Corrupted Axion's healing absorb now properly scales down as the size of a raid decreases from 30 players to 10 players.
Resolved an issue that would cause Fetid Rot from targeting more players than intended on non-Mythic difficulties.
Reduced the health of several enemies in the Helya encounter on Normal and Heroic difficulties.
On non-Mythic difficulties, Adjusted Orb of Corrosion no longer targets Helya's tank targets, similar to its behavior in Mythic difficulty.


Odyn

Fixed an issue that could cause Odyn to sometimes cast a lethal Unerring Blast during the final phase of the encounter.


Items

Many trinkets available from Timewalking holiday dungeons and vendors have had their effects adjusted to more closely match the power level of Legion trinkets.


Player versus Player

Mass Invisibility can no longer be cast on allies holding battleground flags and orbs.


Quests

Havi's message when a player completes "Now That's Just Clawful" will no longer be displayed to all players in the area.
World Quest map markers for Kirin Tor World Quests should now function correctly.
During “Barrels o’ Fun”, a swirling holy light now radiates from the barrel that needs to be tracked.
Players no longer get roadblocked if they teleport out of Well of the Forgotten after interacting with the Bone Pile for the quest "The Rite of the Executioner".



Patch 7.1.5 - Emerald Dreamcatcher Changes
We want to reduce the overall strength of the The Emerald Dreamcatcher , but agree that removing the “Surgeweaving” playstyle it allows isn’t ideal. So, we’re going to take a different approach. Instead of adjusting the buff’s duration, we’re going to reduce the Astral Power cost reduction to 7 per stack down from 10. This should allow you to continue the playstyle of weaving spells in-between Starsurges, but still lower the gap between players who have the Emerald Dreamcatcher and those who don’t.


Patch 7.1.5 - Shadow Priest Changes
To clarify on the 18 seconds thing: The changes to Insanity drain are obviously an overall nerf to Surrender to Madness. That's intentional. We just disagree that it is proportionately more of a problem for lower-skilled players. If you weren't pushing Surrender past 100 stacks already anyway, the difference for you won't be as substantial. If anything, those players are likely to see an increase in duration of their non-Surrender Voidforms.

That said, there's obviously a lot changing for Shadow in 7.1.5, and once things stabilize, we intend to take another look at the rate of Insanity drain to make sure things end up where they should be.

Couple other notes for you:

We're planning to increase Void Bolt's DoT extension to 3 seconds, up from 2.
We're also increasing Shadow's damage across the board in the next build.


Having to recast dots in void form wouldn't be SO still awful but meh bad if we didn't have to die during STM lol.
The intent is that, within reason e.g. you didn't go into Voidform with 1 second left on your DoTs, or forget to actually cast Voidbolt, you can keep your DoTs active during Voidform without having to re-cast them.
