August 26, 2019 10:00 AM PST, We will remove the limitation on only creating a total of three WoW Classic characters per WoW account. Thereafter, players will be able to create up to 10 characters per Classic realm, for a total of 50 characters across all Classic realms per WoW account.<br>
<br>
Additionally, at August 26, 2019 10:00 AM PST, we will open the following new realms in this region:<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
At this time, all realms that have a Full or High population tag are expected to experience extended queues. We urge players on realms marked Full or High to plan to play on one of these new realms to avoid the longest queues, and to help spread the player population as evenly as possible and provide the best play experience for everyone.<br>
Thank you!<br>

Leviathan&apos;s Eye Nerf Blizzard Clarification<br>
Leviathan&apos;s Eye Nerfs show a clear misunderstanding on how WEAK main stats are<br>
The change being discussed here was the first of two changes in this patch that are together related to a cleanup of how stats are calculated for some gems. After the second fix is implemented in the next build of 8.2.5, there should be no overall changes to their stats.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the confusion!<br>

Overcrowded Realm Update &#x2013; August 21<br>
Since our last update, we have continued to see the community create new characters in preparation for the launch of WoW&#xAE; Classic next week. During this process, we have seen a regular trend where characters keep being made on Full realms. Each of the Full realms has a LOT of characters to the extent that it may be more than can fit into the queue system. As a result, you may not be able to get into the queue when you want to play and even if you do, it will likely be a very long wait. For a better play experience, we highly recommend that players avoid creating characters on any realm marked as Full.<br>
<br>
Additionally, at this time, based on their expected population and queues, we strongly advise people to move off the following realms:<br>
<br>
<br>
NA<br>
<br>
Herod &#x2013; PvP<br>
Faerlina &#x2013; PvP<br>
Whitemane &#x2013; PvP<br>
<br>
EU<br>
<br>
Shazzrah &#x2013; PvP<br>
Golemagg &#x2013; PvP<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are currently planning to play on one of these realms, you should expect extremely long queue times that take several hours to get through. In order to have a better play experience, we urge players on these realms to consider moving to the Blaumeux (Pacific Time Zone) and Skeram (Eastern Time Zone) realms.<br>
<br>
All of the existing realms have a healthy population. Even a Full realm in 2006 would be Low by our current metrics. Any realm that is listed above Medium should expect queues at launch, with increasing severity from High to Full.<br>
