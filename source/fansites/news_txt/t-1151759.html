Mists of Pandaria Box Art<br>
Someone over on Reddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/vh3vo/and_so_it_begins_the_mists_of_pandaria_dissipate/) posted an image that looks like it could be the Mists of Pandaria box! As expected, it mentions that you need the Wrath of the Lich King and Cataclysm expansions to play. The Burning Crusade is not mentioned because it is free for anyone who owns WoW as of last year (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/183116-world-of-warcraft-and-the-burning-crusade-%E2%80%93-together-at-last/).<br>

Dual core CPU, up from a single core at 1.4 Ghz. It looks like it may mention a Intel Pentium D rather than Intel Pentium 4.<br>
2GB RAM (or 1GB for Windows XP), up from 1GB RAM.<br>
The X1800 Pro (2005) is now the minimum required GPU, up from the 9500 (2002), which may no longer be supported. <br>
The GeForce FX 5000 series (2003) also has been dropped from the minimum requirements, replaced by the 6800 (2004).<br>
The minimum hard drive space is still 25GB.<br>
The minimum resolution is 1024x768.<br>
<br>
<br>

South Korean players who were unhappy with the stability problems during the Diablo III launch will be able to apply for a refund! This was prompted in part by the Korea Fair Trade Commission investigation into denied refunds, which resulted in a raid on their office (http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2012/05/123_111971.html). South Korean Law allows a customer to receive a refund within seven days of purchasing something if the problems with the product are not caused by the consumer. <br>
<br>
The number of Korean players connected peaked at 430,000, which prompted the installation of more server capacity. The peak for all of Asia was 640,000.<br>
<br>
A player must have not played past level 40 in order to obtain a refund, which will be given out from June 25th to July 3rd. If you purchase the game from now on and want a refund, you will be able to get it as long as you have not played past level 20 and are within 14 days of the purchase date.<br>
<br>
Players who do not apply for a refund will get a free month of Starcraft 2 access, which can be gifted to a friend if the player already has a copy. <br>
