The Zandalari Troll racial ability Embrace of the Loa (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/292752-embrace-of-the-loa) now requires your Zandalari troll to use the ability in front of one of the Zandalari loa shrines around Dazar&apos;alor. This grants you the buff of the loa and will remain until you replace it with another loa shrine. This activates a 5 day cooldown during which you cannot change the buff. You can talk to guards in Dazar&apos;alor to get the specific shrine marked on the map.<br>
