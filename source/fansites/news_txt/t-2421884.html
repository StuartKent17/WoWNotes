<br>
Unintended Conquest for PvP<br>
With the Battle for Azeroth Pre-Patch, we incurred a bug that caused some PvP activities to reward Conquest. Conquest was never intended to be accessible while the season is not active, and while Conquest did appear for some players on their Character Currency tab, it wasn&#x2019;t useable. There aren&#x2019;t any items that can be exchanged for it in-game right now.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll be deploying a hotfix soon that will change any activities that are currently awarding Conquest to award Honor instead.<br>
<br>
When BFA Season 1 begins, players will start earning Conquest as planned. At the same time, we&#x2019;ll convert any unintended Conquest that players earned during the post-season to Honor or gold.<br>
<br>
Additionally, new one-time PvP quests will get reset when BFA Season 1 begins. We want to make sure you can complete those quests to earn Conquest from them as intended. These quests are located in the same place where you turn in Conquest quests, so they should be easy to spot.<br>
<br>
We apologize for any confusion this may have caused, and we&#x2019;re working to make the fixes and conversions as seamless as possible.<br>
<br>
We look forward to everyone engaging with the new Conquest System upcoming in Season 1 of Battle for Azeroth! Click here to learn more.<br>
