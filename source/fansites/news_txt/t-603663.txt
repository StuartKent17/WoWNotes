Boubouille2007-12-06, 07:11 AMToday we've got a few details about the already known 2.3.2 PTR changes, the 2.3.2 PTR Patch notes http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=2506.0 on the site have been updated as well to reflect the new classes changes.

Update : Added something about free character transfers 30 minutes after posting the news, sorry for the early readers. ^^

Season 2 Titles & Mounts
A lot of people have been waiting for an official post about this, yup season 2 rewards are still bugged for some players all over the world, and they're aware of the issue.
The investigation into the incorrect awarding of Season 2 titles and mounts is still ongoing across all regions Europe, the US and Korea.

Though we are aware of your concerns over the delay to resolving this issue, due to the scale and intricacies involved implementing a full solution requires further time and attention. We ask for your patience while the investigation continues, and assure you that it is still a top priority.

Rogues
Hemorrhage is being changed because frontload damages were too high, more group utility is being added instead. Increased damage from debuff Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3271118469&postId=32341764696&sid=1#4



Warlocks
Doomguard and Infernal pets will be improved at some point in the future, quite possibly in Wrath of the Lich King. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3271119029&postId=32344970719&sid=1#10



PvP
Blizzard is definitely aware of the concern and wait times especially in 2vs2 arena as they stand, and are looking into what our options are to help. However, it won't be done immediately because the devs are waiting to see the broader pidcutres, outside of the 2.3/S3/Holidays playing spike.

Developpers are aware that players want the ability to join AV as a group, but they're being careful about how this could affect the queue times and they didn't make any final decision yet. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3269178173&postId=32333466141&sid=1#4



Wrath of the Lich King
You shouldn't see any "old" faction providing rewards in Wrath of the Lich King. From a design philosophy Blizzard prefers to NOT give more experienced players a distinct advantage over new ones. Based on this example the Argent Dawn faction will probably not be re-used for Northrend. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3272958310&postId=32358264827&sid=1#6

The respawns of gas clouds are confirmed to not work properly for the moment, it will be fixed in 2.3.2. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3168509508&postId=32358271391&sid=1#31

Oceanic servers - Internode WoW Gateway trial
Australian players are lagging, this isn't new. Good news for players using Internode, a temporary fix has been published and seems to works well for most of the players. Ping lowered from 450ms to 250ms

- You can check the Howto on Internode forums http://games.internode.on.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=132915
- There are also a lot of feedback posts on Whirlpool.net.au forums http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=872425&p=1, as well as a few Internode representatives posting here. Like this post from Simon Hackett http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=872425#r14 giving some details about it

Keep in mind that this isn't an official fix from Blizzard, and you should read both posts carefully before using it.
