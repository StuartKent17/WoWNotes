With the release of Battle for Azeroth on August 14, players will begin their journey toward bringing two new Allied Races to the fold: Mag&#x2019;har orcs and Dark Iron dwarves (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21701413).

<br>
Complete the War Campaign in Kul Tiras and Zandalar and earn the Achievement Ready for War (Ready for War) (both Horde and Alliance).<br>
<br>
<br>
There&#x2019;s plenty of ground to cover in Battle for Azeroth, and it all comes down to where you&#x2019;ll focus your efforts first.<br>

Uldir Awaits<br>
<br>
Millenia ago, seeking to understand the nature of their eternal foe, the titans constructed this sprawling underground facility to research and quarantine captured specimens. They hoped that by studying the void energy that bound the Old Gods, probing it for weaknesses and reactions, they could find some way to neutralize it. They were horribly, horribly wrong. The facility was sealed away so that the horrors within would never be unleashed upon Azeroth. But now those seals have broken. . . .<br>

Battle for Azeroth: Mythic Keystone Dungeon Season 1 &#x2013; September 4<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re adding a new layer to Mythic Keystone Dungeons with the introduction of Mythic Dungeon seasons that align with the latest content and rewards. As a part of Season 1, we will be introducing using a new seasonal affix&#x2014;Infested&#x2014;which will appear on level 10 or higher Keystones. The Infested affix reflects the extent of the corruption of the blood god G&#x2019;huun as it seeps out into Azeroth to infect select denizens of each dungeon. With each new season, we&#x2019;ll be changing out this third affix to keep players on their toes. How will you deal with these new dangers?</div></div>
