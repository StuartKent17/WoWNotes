With Patch 6.0.2 only a couple of weeks away, now is the time to finish up the Brawler&apos;s Guild! Our friends at Icy Veins have a handy guide (http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/brawlers-guild-guide) to help.<br>
<br>
A few changes aren&apos;t mentioned in the post, such as the new potions (http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Brawler+draenic) being added or the removal of Brawler&apos;s Bladed Claws (http://www.wowdb.com/items/93858-brawlers-bladed-claws).<br>
You&#x2019;ve been beaten and bloodied, laser beamed and chomped, and you&#x2019;ve certainly earned the opportunity to take a breather. The current season of Brawler&#x2019;s Guild is coming to a close once Patch 6.0.2 goes live, but you&#x2019;ll be back in action before you know it. Here&#x2019;s what you can look forward to as we get ready to launch Warlords of Draenor.<br>
<br>

<br>
First, all members of the Brawler&#x2019;s Guild will keep their membership after the patch goes live, so don&#x2019;t worry about having to rejoin. For those who still seek to join the Brawler&#x2019;s Guild, you&#x2019;ll have some opportunities to find a Blood-Soaked Invitation once you arrive on Draenor.<br>
<br>
There are quite a few changes, so let&#x2019;s break &#x2019;em down:<br>
<br>
<br>
All Brawler&#x2019;s Guild achievements earned prior to Patch 6.0.2&#x2014;Season One&#x2014;will become legacy achievements (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/character/legacy?filter-search=brawl). New achievements for Season Two (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/character/world-events/brawlers-guild) will take their place.<br>
Rewards earned based on progression will remain available for purchase. The ring reward (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/118907-pit-fighters-punching-ring) will be updated in Patch 6.0.2 so that it will have valuable stats for all specializations.<br>
The next patch will introduce boss encounters that will be adjusted for level 100 members.<br>
Progression has been reverted back to 8 tiers.<br>
Bosses that are being removed from previous tiers will be added to the challenge card vendor and become available as you progress.<br>
All tiers have had their boss line-ups remixed&#x2014;for example, Bruce is now a rank 5 boss instead of rank 1.<br>

<br>
While we won&#x2019;t be adding new bosses or challenge cards, you will be able to take Meatball (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/followers/203-meatball-meatball) back to your Garrison as a new follower&#x2014;that is, once you&#x2019;ve defeated him. As for the future, who knows what developments Bizmo and Boss Bazzelflange might have planned? For now, get in there, rough up a few bad guys, and get ready for Brawler&#x2019;s Guild to come back with a vengeance!</div></div>
