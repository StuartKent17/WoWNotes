I didn&apos;t have much time to talk about everything last week, we had already way too many things on the site. <br>
For all the warriors still wondering where they can get [item=33174], it drops from Enraged Air Spirits (http://www.wowhead.com/n21060), Enraged Earth Spirits (http://www.wowhead.com/n21050), Enraged Water Spirits (http://www.wowhead.com/n21059) and Enraged Fire Spirits (http://www.wowhead.com/n21061) in Shadowmoon Valley.<br>
Terokk now drops [item=32782], it transforms you into an Arakkoa for 5 minutes and the best part is ... it doesn&apos;t fade when you change zone, take damage, fight, or anything like that. (but you can&apos;t mount while transformed like any other transformation)<br>
I forgot to one loot from the Headless Horseman (added in 2.2.2 during the halloween event, see the other loots in this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=1390.0)), you can get an awesome pet from him called Sinister Squashling. It&apos;s a walking pumpkin that will dig itself in the earth when you don&apos;t move. (Thanks to Beeble for the screenshots)<br>

Season 1 gear for honor at the beginning of Season 3<br>
If you read this site often, you know that the Season 1 arena gear will be available from honor points vendor when the season 3 starts. However I missed a blue post written before the week end with a very interesting detail. I also added this to the list of PvP changes in the 2.3 &quot;unofficial patch notes&quot; just below. <br>
Update 12:00 : I should really sleep more, weapons will indeed be included, post was from 08.28 not 09.28 (not my fault, blame Wildhorn)<br>
We&apos;ve stated on numerous occasions that Season 1 items will be available from honor vendors, and this does include weapons.<br>
<br>
<br>
Patch 2.2.2 and 2.3<br>
Small reminder for the beginning of the week.<br>
2.2.2 Patch<br>
According to this blue post on french official forums (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=1016342728&amp;sid=2), the brewfest should start on October 3rd. The 2.2.2 patch should be deployed on live servers tuesday and <br>
2.3 Patch<br>
If you read this post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1778517774&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=16#317) from Tigole, you will see that Blizzard plans to release the 2.3 on PTR this week, which means Zul&apos;aman, new items everywhere, official patch notes for the classes changes, and more. <br>
<br>
This week will probably be a very busy one, if you&apos;re a member (if you&apos;re not, go register ! (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?action=register)) you might experience some problem logging in while the site is in &quot;omg server is burning mode&quot;. <br>
