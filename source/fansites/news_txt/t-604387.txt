Boubouille2008-01-21, 05:34 AMThe week is starting slowly as usual, it looks like the 2.3.3 patch testing is running flawlessly on the PTRs and it wouldn't be surprising to see it deployed this week on live servers, after that we'll be able to start once again our "When will Blizzard start testing the 2.4 patch on PTR ?" speculations. While you're waiting you can still read the 2.4 Changes compilation 

Raid encounters randomness
Drysc said a few words about randomness in raid encounters.
The need for some amount of randomness was gone over at BlizzCon in the Raid & Dungeons panel, I would recommend looking up some of those shakey-cams on youtube if you've never seen them. Some good insight on design of the encounters.

I would agree that the light-heartedness of the Opera is a really refreshing change, and it was great there's a place for it in Karazhan. In a world of demon-infested castles, dungeons, and dark caves it's not every one you can create such an event and have it fit and make sense. So, I think the Opera event was more a product of location than of the desire to make something a bit more whimsical.

As for Prince Malchezaar and that fight, yeah it's got the whole random thing going on with the infernals. However; you can mitigate the randomness of their drops any number of ways. By being over-geared you can certainly deal with the problems better as they crop up, but then really why are you fighting Prince? You can also track the fall of the infernals, have a barker that's good at watching them and able to anticipate their placement. Or, use one of a couple different placement strategies that make it almost impossible for an infernal to interfere. The last one being the most popular these days I suspect.

Encounters need randomness, as small as miraculously dodging that one hit, all the way up to a fight randomly dropping green meteors on your face. There has to be some amount of randomness, or there's no human element, no need for you and your group to adapt and react, which doesn't make for a fun and engaging fight.


Wowhead/Thottbot model viewer Beta
Wowhead  got updated once again with a very interesting feature : a web model viewer that let you preview the model of any weapon in your browser. It's a beta and there are a few bugs most of the particle effects won't show up but still, it's really useful if you don't really like to rely on screenshots. There is also a high quality viewer using Java instead of flash, and if you've got it installed you should really use this version instead of the flash one. 


 

Thottbot  has been updated as well with the same feature and is probably running on the same engine actually, you won't find the high quality option available on wowhead here, however you'll be able to embed the model of the item to any webpage by using the provided HTML code. You can rotate the following item with your mouse, it's that easy. 



<object width="550" height="366"><param name="movie" value=""></param><param name="FlashVars" value="did=29698&zn=6&iid=17182"></param><embed src="" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="550" height="366" FlashVars="did=29698&zn=6&iid=17182" bgcolor="#000000"></embed></object>

There are a few bugs like items textures not showing properly and items models replaced by NPC models, most of these bugs should be fixed this week.
