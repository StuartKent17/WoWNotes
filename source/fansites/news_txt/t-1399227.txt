Patch 5.4.2 - Karazhan Cleanup
You might have noticed the addition of a new phase, "Karazhan Restoration" in the latest PTR build http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3559-Patch-5-4-2-PTR-Build-17585. It is unclear what that phase will be used for, but the regular version of Karazhan has seen some cleanup in 5.4.2. Most of the spiderwebs, skeletons, and overturned chairs have been removed. All other signs of abandonment and age remain untouched.

Warlords of Draenor Beta
Yes, No or IDK interview question time! Will we see WoD Beta before the end of February?
IDK Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400804590674657280

Warlords' preview looked great but pretty raw compared to how polished everything was for the Pandaria announcement.
That's odd. Feels like we are farther along for WoD than we were for MoP. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400803652366893056

Classes
Will tank dps be looked at for WoD, It's just not right that they are top on so many encounters. They should NEVER be
We are planning on changing Vengeance to only affect defenses and just making tank abilities hit harder. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401044593958854656
That should let tank DPS be relevant, without it being absurd. They may still win meters on big AE fights. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401044728927354882

DoT snapshotting existed before MoP and it's a skill differentiator. The balance issue is Pandemic.
The real issue is temp stat boosts. We just can't do them in class CDs, trinkets etc. when snapshotting is so prominent Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401036505897914368

Spirit won't matter as long as you have varied regen mechanics, mindbender vs innervate? rofl. 600kmana/9min vs 180k/9min...
You can't compare spells in a vacuum. Who runs out of mana first, the Holy priest or Resto druid? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400805202107699200

Hey.. speaking of the new character models.. will druid forms get some love aswell?
I doubt it. They were redone fairly recently in the grand scheme of things. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400807820733321217

You say you want hunters to fill the role of mobile ranged, then give us Snipe. I don't get it. 1of2
The intent is someone who is willing to deal with the challenge of non 100% movement can perhaps benefit from DPS. It's optional. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400806955393884160

Will fire mages get a revamp in 6.0? You remarked before they need work but was not essential in 5.4.
in what way do you think that combustion is hard to understand?
It's not hard to understand per se it's the insane decision tree that Combustion + Alter Time creates & the penalty for failing Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400812351617638400

Is slice and dice deleted for Warlords of draenor for sub and combat?
Not at the moment. We just want to distinguish rotations a bit more by not having all rogues have to manage it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401043581600677888

Warlords of Draenor Flying
I was wondering if Blizzard was planning to cut flying altogether from WoD? The forums can be a scary place sometimes. :|
No. We like no flying when content is relevant. In 6.1 the Draenor zones won't be current, but there will be a new no-fly zone. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400811014708408321

No Flying till 6.1 = Awesome. Will we have FelReaver-esque SAVAGE things to look out for and remember for years to come?
Yes. It is a world of giants. There are gronn and even larger things stomping about. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401041402043170816

We have to quest to fly in 6.1? Why is Blizzard so in love with grinds? I just want to pvp.
The soul of the game is progression. You overcome challenges to earn things. Rewards for free don't feel like rewards. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401037108996866048

Put a compelling, interesting, or fun activity in that encourages people not to fly. Don’t force it
Is there anything fun or compelling about raid trash? Repair costs? Earning lesser charms? Yet those still have value... Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400811733515653120

Name one thing that barring flight gives you that you couldn't do with a little bit of ingenuity without barring flight.
Swoop down, kill quest target, fly away without fighting anything else. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400065798229594112
It seems a lot of the dislike for flying is from pvp? Would I be correct in that assumption?
A small part of it, but we also hate the way folks quest with flying mounts. Swoop down, unlock prison cage, swoop away. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400364941405728768
Questing is boring and tedious as hell at this point. I'd rather just be done with it ASAP.
We don't want it to be an endless slog, but we do view questing as a core component of the experience. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400804467236302848

Can’t wait to see the end of WoD when “No flying” is written off as a mistake after all your defending. Same as dailies were
It's always possible, but we were happy with no flying until 90 and no flying on Timeless Isle or Isle of Thunder. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400804130421104640

PvE
Quick question: what's your favourite class/spec & raid boss? I know you work in a lot of those, but pick one of each 
It wouldn't be prudent to answer the first. For the second, tie between new Ragnaros and Lei Shen. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400807585147658240
Lich King was amazing fav by miles, rag was sick too though. Lei Shen has been one of the best balanced bosses tho
I liked LK a lot, but if I'm being honest, too much of the fight was burning adds or Defile lightning reflexes. Still great. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401045019005431808

can we please have CD reset on ICD effects on boss pull?
We are going to work very hard to make lining up everything on the pull less of a thing. It causes bad gameplay overall. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401042945798717440

Are we supposed to clear Normal *and* Heroic before getting to Mythic?
Just heroic. If you are a mythic prone guild mythic curious? then normal is probably too easy and unrewarding for you. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400811259227959296

Delay the start of raiding in WoD for 1 ~ 2 weeks please! Nice to be able to level without having to rush.
We think that worked out well for MoP. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401041481277771776

Plus, the word Mythic sounds pretty awesome, in my opinion. That matters to people, right?
But everyone at Blizzcon called it MYSTIC. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400373036508925952
Avoid the Mythic/Mystic confusion. Use a word you already use. Legendary Raid!
When we debated that, the fear was the immediate assumption that it dropped all orange loot. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400810703671402497

While there are more 10h than 25h raiders, both groups are still very small. We support heroic raiding, but let's keep the in perspective. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400285801142964224
This is going to be like 5.0 dailies. Wrong solution to the right problem. The ICC system is preferable to a single size.
The problem with ICC is the 10-player raiders felt like second class citizens since the ilevels were lower. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400370489115160576
So how does returning ten mans to second class status make sense now? That is where they are going back to.
Ten player raiding is extremely popular and we are going to continue to support it. Ten player heroic raiding is much less popular. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400809474455130112

For the much larger population of 10n players, flex in 6.0 will only help them. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400286091405570048
The problem with flex is, people stop at 13-14 players because mechanics switch to 25m mode. People dont want to fill up.
There are some break points today, but we've fixed most of those for 6.0. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400416876309647360

Will Mythic mode have to be unlocked by completing Heroic mode? Much like going from Normal mode > Heroic mode is now.
Not sure yet, but it will definitely unlock a week later like it does today. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400365947539570688
but we can start in heroic mode right?Two clears before we can "start" would kinda kill the excitement IMO
Current plan could change is N and H on week two, Mythic on week three if you've beaten H and LFR after that. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400809187627638784

It looks like it's an RL option, like today it's just another option on the list.
Correct. In LFR it's always personal. Else, raid leader can choose. You can argue he or she should go personal in a pug. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400421070324248576
Can you tell if the groups made from the new Browsing Raid will be able to change Loot Specialization middle raid?
Sure. We'll likely still have bonus rolls, and those are always personal even if your loot system is not. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400425732792262656
Would you consider keeping all mount/pet drops as personal even if loot system is not?
I'd worry that some groups like to decide who gets the mount. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400801858941247488


Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
New GPUs from AMD are on the way, so if you are only upgrading your GPU it might be worth it to wait a month or two.

The current SSD prices http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/november/ssdgraph.gif are stable, with most SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. RAM prices are remaining high. 

The Haswell CPUs http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1 run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&tag=mmochamp-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A or H90 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4OCWDE?ie=UTF8&tag=mmochamp-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00B4OCWDE. 

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx and Nvidia http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us drivers up to date.
