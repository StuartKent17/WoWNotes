Ion Hazzikostas Interview
Today's interview is with Ion Hazzikostas Lead Encounter Designer on ConvertToRaid http://converttoraid.com/home/m/2780615/article/1156167. A summary of the main points is below, but listening to the full interview is worth it if you want to hear the full answers!


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/december/ctr.jpg http://converttoraid.com/home/m/2780615/article/1156167 


Looking back at the daily quests, anything that rewards player power feels mandatory to raiders, but this has to be balanced with giving purely cosmetic rewards. There has to be enough of a reward to encourage players to do some quests, but not so much that it feels mandatory for everyone.
The Patch 5.1 daily quests took in to account the Golden Lotus daily quests that rewarded you with more daily quests and kept the number being added this time more reasonable. 
Blizzard wants to keep delivering content and storyline progression through daily quests, because it gives you a better understanding and connection to the faction you are assisting. Tabards ended up with the player running dungeons for rep and never learning anything about the faction whose tabard they had on.
Valor Points being necessary for raiders due to item upgrades feels better than daily quests because of all of the different sources for earning Valor Points versus only being able to do daily quests for reputation. 
Brawler's Guild is working out well, with the limited invites keeping queues reasonable.
Showing the number of LFR bosses that are dead was making it very slow to fill groups. 
The addition of LFR has allowed Blizzard to target Normal difficulty more towards organized guilds that play together regularly and use voice chat. Previously, Normal difficulty was used by both organized guilds and PuGs, which made it somewhat easier than intended.
Staggering the release of the raids worked out well. 
Heroic Sha of Fear was a worthy end boss in terms of the amount of time it took to defeat. It is almost impossible to make encounters that the best guilds won't be able to beat in a matter of days when they are spending so much time raiding. Only 28 guilds http://www.wowprogress.com/encounter/sha-of-fear-heroic have killed Heroic Sha of Fear so far.
Larger patches in the past needed everything to be complete before shipping, which sometimes caused delays. With separate patches for raids and the other content, we are able to see more frequent patches.
Patch 5.2 is coming Soon™ http://www.wowpedia.org/Soon and will include a large and more traditional raid tier. It has been a while since we had a raid zone that was as large as Ulduar or Icecrown Citadel. Blizzard will talking about what will be in it and how many bosses soon! 


Method Interview
Manaflask http://www.manaflask.com/en/article/2115/the-tier-14-king-method-triumphant had the opportunity to speak with members of Method http://www.manaflask.com/en/article/2115/the-tier-14-king-method-triumphant about their thoughts on the first set of Mists of Pandaria raids. They seemed happy with the staggered raid releases, pointing out that it worked as promised by allowing them to not have to try and do all of the bosses at once. 

Method agreed with what Ion said in the interview above, saying "In my opinion the difficulty of these encounters are harder than ever, people are judging the content on the speed in which top guilds are beating these encounters when they shouldn't be. The quality of the guilds in the Top 10 now are so high it's impossible for an encounter to stay alive more than 1 reset unless its either bugged or impossible".

Patch 5.2 Monk Changes
The following changes are currently on the table for 5.2:

Life Cocoon http://www.wowdb.com/spells/116849 will be undispellable and won’t interrupt the cast at the end of the effect and players will also be able to jump as well.
We’re working to resolve the issues with Renewing Mist http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115151 not being able to be used while mounted, though it will dismount the caster after it is cast.
Soothing Mist http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115175 will no longer be able to be Purged, so it will work in a manner similar to the Priest's Penance http://www.wowdb.com/spells/47666. It will still be considered a periodic Heal http://www.wowdb.com/spells/2050.

CC in PvP
CC in general is totally out of control, too much instant !@#$ going on
We would very much like to make it so that more crowd controls start going back to having a cast time. We feel that instant cast spells should be something that's rare to see and we admit that they have become far too common.

LFR Boss Counter Removal Feedback
"oh no someone decided they didn't want to chaperone the mouth-breathing astounding idiots, we better penalise them for valuing their own time." Your logic, and apparently Blizzard's too.
One of the reasons why the counter was removed was to reduce the amount of players fishing for a fresh instance. It was something that was becoming an issue for all the players that were stuck in on-going groups waiting for new players to join. 

When those groups were waiting at, say 2/3, the queue would start looking for new replacements, those replacements would see the queue and decided to skip it in favor of a fresh instance, creating and endless loop for the guys inside the instance where more people would leave as they grew impatient, making it harder to complete the run.

As it is right now, if you enter an on-going run, you're pretty much guaranteed a fresh instance on your next visit. In addition, the developers are considering adding a buff that players in LFR might receive if they wipe on a boss that would boost their stats, which they also hope it might help those impatient players that will leave their current LFR run after a wipe.

Future Challenge Modes
Will you guys ever consider adding more CMs, perhaps old dungeons like Ragefire Chasm/Wailing Caverns?
Actually, the developers would like to add Challenge Modes to existing dungeons from previous expansions. No timelines or anything, though, but it's definitely something they're considering.

Bonus Roll Feedback
While I understand that getting an item that you already have can be somewhat frustrating, this is actually nothing new, since the very beginning of WoW that players have been killing bosses and getting completely randomized loot.

The Elder Charms of Good Fortune are supposed to be an extra chance at getting loot, if anything, having this option the way it currently is, might be already too loot “friendly” in my opinion. 

This option was added because we understand that sometimes players can be after a specific item remember those Dragonspine Trophy hunting days…, this way they get to decide which bosses are the most important for their characters and have a higher chance of grabbing a specific item that they’re so anxious to get their hands on.

RE: Player Model Upgrade difficulty; Greg, can you elaborate for laymen what makes the project "huge"? Implies more than skin.
Look at the Pandaren as an example. New textures need new models which need new animations. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273166112781369344

I would say overall "too little to do" has not been feedback we have heard often for MoP. For Cataclysm, yes. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273179487598952448

Can a new 90 alt catch up gear-wise this arena season with conquest being usable for item upgrades? MoP seems alt-unfriendly.
We agree we need more alt solutions. MoP was designed to be compelling without alts. That means if you have alts, there's too much Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270995686827360256

Hey can we get an option to mail guild invites to alts?
Would love to see that with some kind of guildmaster control. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270700729054920704

Yes that may be true but did you guys ever stop to think and listen to people saying gating isn't fun.
Yes. The opposite of gating tends to be epic grinding followed by nothing to do. We try to strike a balance. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272792552640495617

"There was no alternative to the head enchant. There are plenty of alternatives to valor gear." what are they?
Killing raid bosses for one. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273178341874466816

UI / Addons
The new item tooltips are a mess. Whoever though this looked or conveyed information better was wrong. Please revert.
We like it. Can you elaborate? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273552106974236672

The addon that let us paint the world? That could've been fun, but you engineered the game to stop that.
it wasn't to nerf fun. It took all the individual responsibility out of raiding. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/271386351784587264

Talent/Glyph + D.Journal taint bug is starting to drive me nuts. Reload UI 2-3 times to use stuff Bliz pushed as key features?
Taint bugs are almost certainly caused by mods trying to access stuff they shouldn't. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273167027043180544

Hey will WoW's taint detection be worked on? I am pretty fed up of my addons being blamed for things they don't even look at.
If the addon goes after a protected feature, it gets the taint. It's pretty cut and dried as far as I know. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270595501202755584
75% of my raid has to /reloadui to change glyphs/talents. Taint spreads like defile! Very difficult to debug.
I am sympathetic, but we can't debug all of the addons players develop. There are great sites out there that attempt to do so. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270624444458868736

Why are UX /UI changes slow in WoW vs. system changes?
Depends on the change, but UI often involves code changes while many class changes can be done through data by designers. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270633823224594433

Can we have a UI feature to show how much of an enemy absorb we have left to break through? Absorb Absorb Absorb isn't helpful
Yes that's definitely on our wish list. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272427001686654976
