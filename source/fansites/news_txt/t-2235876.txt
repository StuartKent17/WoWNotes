Brawl - Packed House
The Packed House brawl is now available!
Up to 30 players clash in this packed Arena match


Crafted Item Scaling
Crafted items seem to be scaling to 900 ilvl instead of 885 like the patch notes say - intended?
Correct. We'll have a complete hotfixes update later today with new hotfixes such as this one.


Gul'dan Health Adjustment
Any word on when we are going to know what the Guldan changes are? Would love to know before raid tonight.
These hotfixes are not live yet, but they're mainly a small decrease to Gul'dan's health to offset changes to some items and set bonuses.


Legion PvP Season 4 Begins!
Legion PvP season 4 is here, and the Arenas and Battlegrounds await the clash and clamor of weaponry and magic once more.

Season 3 Rewards Reminder
If you participated in Season 3, please keep the following in mind to ensure you receive the rewards that you’re due:


Refrain from transferring your characters to another realm or faction until after Legion Season 3 rewards have been distributed.
Legion Season 3 titles and mounts will be awarded approximately two weeks after the season ends.


Faction-Based Rewards
Don’t forget—end-of-season rewards are based on your faction. If you transfer your character to the other faction, you must have 50 wins after your transfer to receive the reward. Please note that you must have 150 wins for Gladiator and Cruel Gladiator.

The Arenas and Battlegrounds await!


Artifact Power Reward Changes
The official notes were updated with some additional artifact power changes.

Legion Raid bosses now have a new Artifact Power item that drops 100% of the time, once per week, on all difficulties except Raid Finder. Bosses in the newest Raid drop more Artifact Power than older Raids.
On Raid Finder difficulty, bosses no longer drop Artifact Power items. Artifact Power is now rewarded once per week at the completion of each Raid Finder wing.



Order Hall Mission Bonus Reputation Rewards
Scuuuu on Reddit  noticed that missions now reward Greater tokens, such as Greater Tribute of the Broken Isles , that award 1500 reputation.
