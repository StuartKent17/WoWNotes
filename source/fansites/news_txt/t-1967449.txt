Legion PvP Testing
This morning, a wave of invites was sent out with a focus on PvP experience. We'll continue to monitor participation. Thanks! Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/405780-accurate-testing/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743015132?page=1#3

Item Level Scaling in PvP
Can we get any confirmation how it trickles down to lower level PvP? Still static 0.1%?
Low levels are currently set to the same scaling values as level 110. The baseline item level is different for each bracket. It is approximately the ilevel of an heirloom item at the max level for each bracket.

Grove Warden
Will they ever fix Grove warden? The camera bug is making me so dizzy, I love the looks of the mount but can't stand using it.
Just a... heads-up... this is something that we are aware of and it's being tracked for a fix in an upcoming patch. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/405630-groove-warden/ / Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17610891710?page=1#9

Classes
doesn't matter when often one "style" is too good not to play over the other talent. i often choose my gameplay style by class.
During alpha, you should pretty much ignore tuning. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/709792052326703104

happy with the state of balance druid gameplay on #legion? Would love to hear design goal, spec seems a bit... lost atm
Balance is looking solid, especially after the latest Artifact revisions. Any specific feedback or questions? https://t.co/hyt0g0EJ7q WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/709558212911964160
Our issues are here in this post, but no Dev gave us an answer.https://t.co/DvhMjCUogp
That feedback is almost exclusively about tuning, which hasn't happened yet. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/709567924017754112

Art
Will male-BE in #legion eventually get ALL the updated melee animations? i.e. Bloodthirst upwards swing instead of old spin
This is an interesting question. They have the animations, but some iconic race-specific animations are still... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/709464102666522624
...used for a few things, since players found them iconic. Don't want to lose all the soul of the race. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/709464670193717248

Character / Items
Will the Warglaives of Azzinoth be recoded as "warglaives" with new warglaive animations? Or still swords and old animation?
It's important that Warriors and Rogues continue to be able to use them, so they will likely remain as swords. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/709558649702625280

The shapeshift camera bug is there with ghost wolf form, too
We are aware of this issue across many transformations on the Alpha. We're working on fixing it soon. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/709558961939177473

Artifact based abilities seem to act like Artifact is a separate mob - critless DotS, only 5% Crit, no benefits from Mastery
They should act like you casting them, using your stats. It's a bug if not. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/709816076243107840

PvP
Curious if WarcraftDevs are seeing anyone use Adaptation or Relentless in #PVP. Everyone I've seen uses Medallion. 
We would be interested in hearing feedback from players who have tried Adaptation or Relentless in PvP. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/709552349438545920

Will we get an option to see our PvP Prestige progress on a bar like our Xp and Artifact Power?
Yes, this will be an option! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/709552558860140544


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
LFD was a choice between doing content or not doing it at all. Could take hours to find dungeon groups.
I'll argue that's a false dichotomy. I agree with the problem but maybe there were other solutions. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/709431161114591233

I dont get why you think matchmaking is no valid group setup mechanism if most of the players prefer it over organization.
I think they are valuing convenience though. It's like being surprised that players like free loot. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/709466072739479552
In BC, Mechanar was the most popular dungeon by far. I don't think it was for the encounters. It was for quick badges. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/709466531550244865
So you just have to be careful when you measure participation that you don't mis-conclude they love the content they are doing. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/709466737628975110
