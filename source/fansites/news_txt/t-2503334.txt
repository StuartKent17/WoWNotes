chaud2019-08-14, 10:56 PMNew WoW Classic Realm Opening Today
Due to very high demand, we will open a new WoW Classic realm for name reservations at 5:00 p.m PDT 8:00 p.m. EDT today, Wednesday, August 14:

Stalagg – PvP – Eastern Time

We suggest that players, especially those on the Herod realm, consider creating characters on Stalagg. We expect that other PvP realms in this region will otherwise experience significant login queues when Classic launches.

Thank you!


Extended Queues Expected on Select Realms
As of now, a large number of WoW Classic characters have been created on the following realms. Players with characters on this realm are likely to experience severe queues at release.


Herod - PvP
Whitemane - PvP


We have updated the algorithm for the realm population tags so they more accurately reflect the expected population for that realm. The realms that are listed as “Full” are where we expect to see extended queues. If you’re concerned about long queue times affecting your play experience, you may want to consider creating characters on a lower population realm before the game releases on August 26 at 3:00 p.m. PDT.
