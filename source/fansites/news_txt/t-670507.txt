We have released a minor bug fix patch to version 3.2.2a. This sort of patch is very small in size, and we use them to fix specific issues that canâ€™t be hot-fixed. Issues addressed with this patch: 

Fixed an issue players were having with ESC key causing the Battleground queue window to close.
Fixed an issue players were having with entering Battlegrounds while dead or in combat, while already in a Battleground.
Fixed the Wintergrasp zone map so it now shows the status of all walls correctly.
Fixed a crash Mac clients were experiencing with ATI driver.
Fixed the performance of certain spells that have transparent components.
