During one of the latest PTR Build I don't know how old this is to be honest, but I don't think it's been reported yet, items from the season 4 got their stats changed. 
The ilvl of the only known weapon, the Brutal Gladiator's Greatsword http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/brutalgladgreatswordv2.jpg Old stats http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/brutalgladiatorgreatsword.jpg had its ilvl reduced from 159 to 154. The DPS and a few stats have been lowered. 
The armor on the only known set, the Brutal Gladiator's Vindication http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/brutalgladvindicationv2.jpg Old stats http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/brutalgladiatorvindication.jpg has been increased !

Rogues - Shiv bug
I've spoken with the devs and shiv not being missed or dodged is a bug and was never intended. The changes to the combat log revealed some problems with how this spell is coded and it is being worked on.
