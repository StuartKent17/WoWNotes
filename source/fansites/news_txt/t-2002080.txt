In Russia, the movie had the second biggest opening, with 65% market share.

Talent Changing Bug and Tome of the Tranquil Mind
I would also like to point out that a Demon Hunter can't select a new talent while leveling without going back to town. Its like old school class trainers!!!
This is a bug. You should always be able to select a talent if you have none currently chosen for a given row.

In today's build, players may notice a new Inscription recipe for a single-player consumable, Tome of the Tranquil Mind , that can be consumed to allow an individual player to freely swap talents for a period of time. The materials needed to craft a Tome are vastly lower than those needed to craft the group-oriented Codex formerly Wartome of the Tranquil Mind , which remains as a solution for larger raid groups or guild banks that want to centralize the process, similar to the relationship between Feasts and individual food.

Legion Beta Disconnection Bug
And this was suppose to be a build fix? It was better before this build.
Yes, the build contains thousands of bug fixes. Unfortunately there is one new one that is causing the disconnects you guys are experiencing. We are working to have it resolved soon™ so you can stay in-game long enough to experience other new bugs and report them too! Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Legion Minimum GCD
This build does have a 750ms minimum GCD in all cases. This is something we're trying out provisionally to see how it works on beta. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Blood Death Knight Feedback -- Legion Beta Feedback
The 20% healing was tested on alpha and it proved to be too low, why the hell change it back? So we have the most underwhelming active mitigation ever?
The 'nerf' to Death Strike was mostly a misnomer. Bone Shield is an absorb now, so counts towards Death Strike. It also effectively stacks additively with self-healing from other sources, which there are much more of now, such as from the artifact. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
