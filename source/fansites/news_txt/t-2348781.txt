Items

Carafe of Searing Light now correctly shares a short cooldown with other "Use" trinkets.
Convergence of Fates primary stat increased by 13%. Effect reduced to 3 seconds of cooldown reduction was 4 seconds.

Developers’ notes: This change is aimed at changing how Convergence of Fate scales with item level – or rather, how it doesn’t. For some specializations, the cooldown reduction effect is so powerful that the item level of the trinket is all but irrelevant. We’re shifting more of the item’s power to primary stat and less in the base proc to cause the trinket’s scaling with item level to be more similar to other trinkets in Legion.

Garothi Feedback Conduit Haste amount increased by 10%.
