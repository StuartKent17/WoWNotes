Preview: Demon Invasions
Blizzard posted their Demon Invasion preview today! We previously covered this part of the pre-expansion patch here. 


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/invasionBanner.jpg http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5754-Legion-Features-Update-Demon-Invasion-Event-Warcraft-Movie-Updates-Shadow-Preview#demoninvasion 

There’s a World of Warcraft: Legion pre-expansion patch coming soon, and that means a great number of changes and improvements will be finding their way into the game. We’ve recently outlined several reasons to get ready for it all here http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/20176410/the-legion-pre-expansion-patch-is-nearly-here-7-8-2016 and here http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/20175675/time%E2%80%99s-running-out-7-11-2016.

Today, we’d like to take a closer look at the some of the content that will be coming to Azeroth in the weeks after the pre-expansion patch.

Incursions and Diversions
Around the second or third week of August no later than August 17 globally, after you’ve had time to play around with the patch and get a feel for the changes, some angry invaders are going to start dropping out of the skies over Azeroth.


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/thumb/invasionPreview01.jpg http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/invasionPreview01.jpg 

You’ll be able to identify where the invasions are currently happening by looking at your world map. As quickly as you can, head out to the zone that’s under attack and lend your aid to the defense of Azeroth.

Each demon invasion takes place in four stages, and each stage ends with a reward of Nethershards http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/1226-nethershard#related:currency-for;_!—and sometimes a chest. That means it’s always a good time to rush out and fight the Legion.

A week after the invasions begin, the Legion’s assault will begin to intensify. Then, a week after that, the demonic onslaught will intensify even more, increasing your chances to complete the event-only achievements Stand Against The Legion http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/11200-stand-against-the-legion for completing one invasion and Defender of Azeroth: Legion Invasions http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/11201-defender-of-azeroth-legion-invasions for completing invasions in all six locations.

Loot Intensifies
When you participate in demon invasions and receive Nethershards, you’ll want to hold on to them. Collect enough, and you can spend them on all sorts of transmogrification armor there will be four ensembles available: cloth, leather, mail, and plate, new pieces for your neck, fingers, back, and trinket slots, as well as the event-only Felbat Pup battle pet, among and other useful items.


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/thumb/invasionPreview02.jpg http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/invasionPreview02.jpg 

Speaking of weapons, you’ll always want to open the chests http://beta.wowdb.com/items/139049-large-legion-chest you obtain from demon invasions, as they have a chance to drop one of 16 event-only weapons http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-expansion=7&filter-ilvl-min=700&filter-ilvl-max=700&filter-quality=8&filter-slot=2285568, such as Niskaran Morning Star http://beta.wowdb.com/items/138762-niskaran-morning-star or Staff of the Inquisiton http://beta.wowdb.com/items/141608-staff-of-the-inquisiton. At item level 700, these weapons might be more than a transmogrification collection item for you—they might be the perfect thing to pick up and swing at the face of the nearest demon!

Remember to Share
One more item that we’d like to tell you about is a new toy that will be available during the Demon Invasions: the Pocket Fel Spreader http://beta.wowdb.com/items/140363-pocket-fel-spreader. It’s not actually a good idea to leave it in your pocket, but it is a great idea to figure out how to obtain one of these tainted trifles—because this may be your only chance.

For Azeroth!

Havoc Demon Hunter Feedback -- Legion Beta Feedback
Demon Blades is much stronger than intended in this build; this will be corrected before live. The intended change was to increase the Fury generation to allow Demon Blades builds to use Chaos Strike more often than they had been. But the damage done by Demon Blades itself is in line with the old amount of Fury generation, and too high for the current amount. We also agree the talent shouldn't be the highest stationary DPS option on its row due to its passivity, and it will be brought into line for the row.

Assassination Rogue -- Legion Beta Feedback
There is no change to Mutilate damage at level 110 in this build. Some data changed under the hood, but tooltips should still be showing the correct damage in-game. This applies to a number of other weapondamage-based attacks on various specs.

Outlaw Rogue -- Legion Beta Feedback
An upcoming build will be shifting a noticeable amount of damage from Saber Slash to Run Through and Between the Eyes. Between the Eyes is getting a slightly higher proportionate increase in order to make it more of a gain to swap to it during Shark Infested Waters. In addition, the bonus on a number of artifact traits is being increased to bring the total damage increase more in line with other artifacts. Expect a few offsetting changes, such as having to reduce Quick Draw's bonus to account for a large buff to Blunderbuss.

We'll keep an eye on the spec's energy economy, and it is improved slightly due to a buffed version of Fatebringer. But particularly due to the high uptime of either Buried Treasure or Grand Melee or alternatively, Slice and Dice the spec has significant periods where overcapping energy is more of a risk than having long droughts. Not to mention the short cooldown on Adrenaline Rush compared to the past. So we're not planning at the moment to speed up the spec's pace further.

Elemental Shaman -- Legion Beta Feedback
Just noticed Alpha Wolves has been way overpowered--had missed that and it probably contributed to artifact doing too much damage.

Did something recently make Tempest a lot more popular or overpowered?

Earthquake Totem should be fixed in the next build. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/411810-elemental-shaman-legion-beta-feedback/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743726123?page=28#550

Enhancement Shaman Feedback -- Legion Beta Feedback
An upcoming build will be increasing the baseline damage of Feral Spirits. Alpha Wolf and Doom Wolves will be tuned down somewhat, partially to account for the increased attack power on Feral Spirits, and also because they are already an overly high portion of single-target damage particularly since Alpha Wolves is AoE-focused, as was correctly noted above. We're okay with wanting to press Crash Lightning 1-2 times during the Feral Spirits duration due to an artifact trait, so long as it's not a gain to use Crash Lightning at other times against a single target except with Crashing Storm.

Damage of various core abilities is being increased as noted before, as well as a few talents particularly Windsong and Lightning Shield. Boulderfist should be brought more into line with its row, since it's still somewhat strong even after the various recent changes to Maelstrom pacing.

Will you guys be putting the pvp multipliers in the tooltip of abilities? It's hard to tell without looking it up. #LegionQA
In the future, we hope too. There are technical reasons we haven't done it yet client memory. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/748639630380122112

To clarify from QA, do i have to prestige 12 times or 4 times if i want a S3 Reward but didnt prestiege S1 and S2?
12 times. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/748642285940768768

Is their gonig to be different PvP Multipliers in RBG's as opposed to Rated arena's?
No holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/748736969581010944

Reputation / Questing
will Archivist Elysiana allow us to play the scenarios once #Legion launches, or will it only show cutscenes? Huge concern 4me
You will play out the full quests, no different than playing them during prelaunch. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/750916528900493312

At what rep level can Arcway and Court of Stars be unlocked? Been doing WQs for weeks now and still can't test them.
What's your rep level currently? WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/751127714963136512
I'm 6k into Honoured next rep level being Revered.
2k to go then. But we're adjusting upwards the rate at which Nightfallen rep rate is gained. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/751264479552253952
