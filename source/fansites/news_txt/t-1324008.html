<br>
Overview - When the fight begins, Norushen seals all players inside a Quarantine Zone and extracts a portion of each player&apos;s corruption to form an Amalgam of Corruption. The object of the encounter is to destroy this creature. Players must reduce their personal level of Corruption in order to inflict full damage to the Amalgam. Players can accomplish this by interacting with the nodes of Purifying Light that active around the room, which will pull them into another phase where they must face a role-specific challenge. Overcoming this challenge will Purify the player and allow them to inflict full damage to the Amalgam.<br>

Patch 5.4 - Celestial Tournament Testing<br>
New adjustments and fixes have been applied to the Celestial Tournament on the PTR and we&apos;re seeking your **feedback. If you&apos;re a seasoned veteran of Pet Battles and have a robust selection of level 25 pets, head on over and speak to Master Li on the Timeless Isle. Once in the scenario, Emperor Shaohao will be your guide and instruct you on what you will need to accomplish.<br>
<br>
As with anything still in development, please keep your comments constructive when providing us with feedback. Regardless of the extent of your experiences in Pet Battles, your thoughts are valuable to us and we look forward to hearing from you!<br>
<br>
**Note: To be safe, we recommend you place your pets in a cage (as many as you can) and leave them in your bags before transferring to the PTR to avoid potential issues. There are still a few quirks with the character transfer process which we&#x2019;re working on correcting, but may affect which pets will be on your PTR character once it arrives.<br>
<br>
You REALLY should warn people that they will be facing off against 13 PETS in this tournament each day.<br>
It&apos;s a weekly event, not daily.<br>
<br>
I can completely understand why you have set the min amount of pets to even qualify for this, but it is likely someone is going to run through 15-20 pets in this due to the &quot;NO HEALING&apos; debuff you have while in this scenario.<br>
You&apos;re catching on! And yes, it&apos;s going to be a challenge and tough to defeat so having a solid list of level 25 pets is recommended.

Patch 5.4 Frost Mastery<br>
The feedback from the community has been extremely vital to getting this new Mastery working well. Iteration is key to us, and Icicles are a perfect example of that. <br>
<br>
Overall, we like the core concept of Icicles, and are refining things at this point. The next (or perhaps one after that) PTR build will include several revisions. The Frostbolt debuff is now &#x201C;baked in&#x201D; (meaning the debuff no longer increases damage taken, but the spells it modified now do more baseline damage), and Waterbolt no longer generates Icicles (with Mastery now increasing Waterbolt&#x2019;s damage directly). We&#x2019;re also speeding up the rate at which Icicles launch when triggered by Ice Lance, as well as a few other tweaks.<br>
<br>
We look forward to more feedback from testing that next iteration on it. Thanks all. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/264859-icicles/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9499690327?page=35#698))<br>

Patch 5.4 Mana Tea Changes Reverted<br>
After a lot of heavy discussion, we&apos;ve decided not to go ahead with the Mana Tea nerfs for now. As many of you have pointed out (and we&#x2019;re keenly aware), solving the issues with Mistweavers&#x2019; mana regen is not a small task, and while we&#x2019;re not happy with how things are working currently, it&#x2019;s just a bigger problem than we&#x2019;re comfortable trying to solve in 5.4. We&#x2019;ll be revisiting the issue in the future.<br>
<br>
Note: There is a possibility that the next PTR build will have a number of other changes that we were considering, but have since decided not to go ahead with. Should that happen, they will be reverted in the build after next.

Proving Grounds<br>
is proving grounds meant to last into the future, or just a MoP feature?<br>
we&apos;d like for it to endure. The current one has a Pandaren theme but we could rebuild it to use a different theme. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357145779485421568))<br>
<br>
Do DPS Stand in fire the entire time in a Healer Proving Ground? That would be epic.<br>
They also body pull adds that the tank hasn&apos;t picked up yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357144790028128256))<br>
<br>
Will DPS proving grounds be tuned around having a 24 sec interrupt? If so, whats the expectation for Shadow Priests w/ 45s?<br>
Most CCs also work to interrupt in Proving Grounds. You should be fine. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356892534586347522))<br>
<br>
Proving Grounds 90 is a missed opportunity; shouldn&apos;t this be encouraged at lower levels, i.e. 30, to &apos;learn your role(s)&apos;<br>
If the feature proves popular, we&apos;ll certainly expand on the idea. We&apos;d have to change the content quite a lot for low lvls. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356890927610068994))<br>

UI / Addons<br>
Does the restriction on changing raid groups in combat still serve a purpose nowadays? &quot;Okay, 3 minute break before Ji-Kun...&quot;<br>
A little concern about a mod that puts the debuff target in slot 1 and lets the dispeller spam slot 1. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352113555270668288))<br>
If we could prevent that, then it would be fine to let you switch whenever. We know it&apos;s a hassle. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352113691279360001))<br>
<br>
PTR<br>
Presumably you still pay your QA staff?You&apos;d get more players on the PTR if you didn&apos;t treat it like free testing.<br>
We don&apos;t really target PTR to players for bug finding. Our QA will find nearly all bugs. It&apos;s more about feedback. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357515057480994816))<br>
