Method  killed Kael'thas for the first time tonight, despite the fact that they're nice ... why would you care ?
Easy, they dropped the Ashes of Al'ar, the phoenix mount is now confirmed to be a drop from Kael'thas. 


   

Itemstats
If you checked Method  website, you'll notice that they're using itemstats, which is a nice module for EQDkp and tons of PHP Portal to show item tooltips.
Good news for all the itemstats users and I'm sure there are many of them, a Wowhead parser  is now available, it's still a beta but it seems to work fine for most of the people who tried it. 

Website
Xavalia posted a Sha'tari Skyguards Reputation Guide  on the forums, check it, it's nice. 
I'm done updating most of the item pages with the new 1 month old-new item tooltips, only the consumables and the jewelcraft list aren't updated yet and should be updated soon. You probably don't care but this update alone explain why I didn't release new content in the past weeks, had to change a few thousand itemID on the site. Basically, it means more interesting update, soon.
