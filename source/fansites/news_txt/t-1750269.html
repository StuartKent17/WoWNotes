Racials and Faction Balance in PvP<br>
There&apos;s an interesting social phenomenon surrounding racial balance in highly rated PvP. I don&apos;t think that equal representation (or even close) is actually possible at the top end of the rankings.<br>
<br>
Let me preface this by saying that I&apos;m not going to make the argument that racials are perfectly balanced. I honestly don&apos;t have much info to share in terms of actual racial balance other than it&apos;s something we talk about fairly regularly. So, don&apos;t take this as me saying &quot;racials are fine,&quot; just providing a secondary viewpoint on racial distribution at the highest skill levels in PvP. Racial balance is something we constantly investigate and it&apos;s entirely possible we will make further adjustments in the future.<br>
<br>
Now that we&apos;ve got that out of the way: top-rated PvP&apos;ers like to be able to play with each other. If we&apos;re looking at the top 500 PvP&apos;ers, 500 people is a small enough community that, if I want to be sure I can always find a solid teammate, I&apos;m going to want to pick whichever faction other people are playing.<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough, in Mists of Pandaria, the vast majority of top-rated PvP&apos;ers in the North American region were Horde, while the opposite was true in Europe, where most of the top-rated PvP&apos;ers were Alliance. In NA, we saw a ton of feedback that Alliance racials (other than Human) were weak and needed buffs. In EU, we saw the same feedback, but for the Horde races. Both regions were playing the exact same game, but were giving opposing feedback -- and overwhelmingly so.<br>
<br>
Then, Warlords released, and we made a few balance tweaks to racials that ended up being mostly buffs on the Alliance side (most notably to Stoneform), and nerfs for Horde (some of which were later reverted, e.g. Will of the Forsaken). In the wake of this, a ton of top-end North American PvP&apos;ers faction changed to Alliance.<br>
<br>
Now, you could make the argument that all of those players independently decided that Alliance racials were buffed so much that they should faction transfer. It&apos;s certainly possible. I think that at least some number of those players weren&apos;t faction transferring over racials, though. I think they were faction transferring because their friends and teammates were.<br>
<br>
I guess the points I&apos;m trying to make here are:<br>
People want to play with their friends, which is pretty obvious but also has interesting social effects. When you&apos;re looking at a sample size as small as 500, those social effects will amplify game balance issues, even if the actual difference is minor (or heavily influenced by perception, as the MoP example shows).<br>
<br>
All that being said, I&apos;ll bring up racials to the design team again. Can&apos;t guarantee I&apos;ll have any info to share, just that I&apos;ll ask about it. I just think that the extreme top end is always going to skew towards one faction, even if racials are perfectly balanced.

<br>
PvP Issues<br>
Ultimately, I think we&apos;d rather people be able to use their actual characters (who they&apos;ve put the effort into leveling, collecting achievements, earning fancy titles, etc) for something like this, instead of requiring you to access a separate realm and make a new character that you probably don&apos;t care about as much.<br>
<br>
That said, we&apos;ve certainly experimented with some ideas along these lines. For example, you may remember the Trial of the Gladiator concept we were considering for Warlords of Draenor, which would have been a scheduled period of ladder matches that required the use of Tournament gear. There were several, very valid, concerns about what the actual implementation of that idea would have done to the normal ladders, but I think the core concept is smart, and it&apos;s possible we&apos;ll revisit that idea in the future.<br>
<br>
Standard caveat applies that I am not a designer and am not a direct part of those decisions, so I&apos;m mostly just spitballin&apos; here, but I think it&apos;s a cool idea.<br>
<br>
(Side note: although the discussion itself is fine, please avoid referring to third-party hacks by name, as it only encourages others to use them.)<br>
<br>
A separate realm would solve a lot and make things easier as far as balance.<br>
Realistically, I don&apos;t think we&apos;d want to put up a separate realm that has individual balance changes that only apply there. If it&apos;s a good change, it makes sense that it should be applied to PvP on live realms as well. In cases where a change has potentially negative effects in PvE but positive ones for PvP, I think we&apos;d rather make the change only apply in PvP situations (and have done so on several occasions).<br>
<br>
So, in the most vaguest, hypothetical terms, if there&apos;s an ability that is ridiculously broken in PvP, like Hunter Murder of Crows, but nerfing it would hurt PVE, what are the steps taken to decide whether to nerf it or how such changes are made?<br>
So long as we can agree we&apos;re speaking in hypotheticals here (reminder once again that I am not a designer):<br>
<br>
We&apos;ve actually done PvP-only nerfs to damage abilities many times in the past. Colossus Smash and Chaos Bolt are examples that immediately come to mind. Colossus Smash&apos;s armor reduction is lower on players, and until very recently, Chaos Bolt&apos;s damage was lowered against players.<br>
<br>
So, using your example, if the design team were to decide that Murder of Crows needed a PvP-only nerf, they could easily make it deal less damage to players without affecting PvE in the slightest. The reason such a nerf hasn&apos;t happened isn&apos;t because the designers have decided that &quot;PvE is more important&quot; or anything like that, it&apos;s just because they haven&apos;t decided to make that change.<br>
<br>
Specifically looking at Hunters -- and it&apos;s possible I&apos;m reading into your question a little too much here -- I think a lot of people have misunderstood the intentions of the recent Tranq Shot nerf. Obviously, increasing the Focus cost will have a small impact on Hunter damage when facing comps where dispelling is important. So, it&apos;s understandable why a player upset about Hunter damage would come to the conclusion that increasing the Focus cost of Tranq Shot was intended as a PvP-specific damage nerf.<br>
<br>
However, the potential (and minor at most) damage loss in PvP wasn&apos;t really the point of the change. Tranq Shot was nerfed because the design team felt that Tranq Shot was too powerful. The potential impact to PvP damage is just an acceptable side effect. If the goal was to reduce Hunter damage in PvP, they would have done something else entirely (possibly even the Murder of Crows nerf you&apos;ve suggested).<br>
<br>
That got a lot wordier than I was expecting, but hopefully I was at least able to answer your question.<br>
<br>
Really, you&apos;re claiming they nerfed tranq shot for PVE reasons? It was already a lost global and 20 focus of lost dps. If PVE is truly why it was nerfed it was a nonsensical change to an already balanced ability.<br>
Er, no. It was nerfed primarily because the designers felt it was too easy for Hunters to dispel in PvP. It just wasn&apos;t nerfed for damage reasons.<br>
<br>
It does have an extremely minor effect in PvE, but that wasn&apos;t the focus (pun not intended). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/367194-lore-i-have-an-idea/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16859936094?page=3#41))<br>
<br>
CC Consolidation in PvP<br>
This suggestion comes up a lot, and I know there are other games that have experimented with the idea. We don&apos;t think it&apos;s necessarily the right choice for WoW PvP though. Coordinating and maximizing CC is a huge part of PvP gameplay, especially in Arenas. <br>
<br>
While there have certainly been cases of CC chains getting out of control, and it&apos;s possible that some comps still have a little too much potential for non-stop CC, we don&apos;t think removing the interaction between different CC categories entirely is the right way to resolve that.
