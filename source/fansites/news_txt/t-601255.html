<br>
First, the Twin Blades of Azzinoth Glow animation was fixed and I realized that I never took the time to post the final version. I also realized that my Shaman tier 5 weapons screenshot wasn&apos;t accurate in the tier 5 weapons post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=152.0), weapons were in the wrong hands. <br>
Also added a few unreleased bows, the one to the left is from Mount Hyjal (notice the head of Archimonde on it), the one to the right is from the Black Temple. I don&apos;t know where the two others drop, but they weren&apos;t tagged as Hyjal or Black Temple. <br>

<br>
I also wanted to write something about an impressive fan art posted on CGSociety (http://features.cgsociety.org/story_custom.php?story_id=4006&amp;page=1) a few days ago. You can see the making off on their article (http://features.cgsociety.org/story_custom.php?story_id=4006&amp;page=1).<br>

<br>
And while we&apos;re talking about fanarts, I&apos;ll post two more, the first one is from Dan Scott, you can check his other works on Conceptart.org forums (http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=78672)<br>
The 2nd one is from M.C. Barrett and was also posted on Conceptart.org forums (http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=77582). This one is definitely not related to WoW, but I thought it might be a good idea to post it with all the hype going around the Blizzard secret project (OMG STARCRAFT 2 !) ^^<br>
