Druid Artifact Transmog in Battle for Azeroth
The latest beta build added the Artifact transmog system:


When transmogging your weapon, there is an option under the weapon type drop down menu called "Artifact Pair." 
When you select this, you see your basic artifact weapon and the different versions of each weapon.
When you right click the version, a list of the different forms and color options is able to be selected to apply to your character.
The form is still linked to your artifact weapon and so your weapon will appear as the claws or daggers based on spec regardless of what weapon you have equipped. ex - your equipped polearm would still turn into the dual daggers.
A similar system is in place for other classes.
