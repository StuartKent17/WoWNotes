<br>
If you want early access to this year&#x2019;s sale, just order a BlizzCon 2018 Virtual Ticket (https://www.battle.net/shop/product/blizzcon-virtual-ticket). Once you purchase your Virtual Ticket, your Blizzard account will automatically be flagged to purchase BlizzCon items from the Blizzard Gear Store beginning with the early access period on October 11.<br>
<br>
If you&#x2019;re attending the show in person, you should have already received a code to redeem this year&#x2019;s digital bonuses&#x2014;including a Virtual Ticket, which grants on Blizzard account early access to the BlizzCon merch sale. These codes were emailed directly to ticket buyers, so if a friend purchased a ticket for you, check with them for your code.<br>
<br>
If you&#x2019;re in Europe or the Americas, your order will ship out from the Europe or North America Gear Stores respectively. Not all countries may be eligible to participate, and international shipping rates and other fees may apply. For more information, including how to find out if the Gear Store ships to your region, see the Blizzard Gear Store Shipping (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/131888) article on our support site.<br>

*Not all items may be available for purchase from the EU Gear Store when the sale begins.</div></div>
