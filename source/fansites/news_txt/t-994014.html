I would also like to mention that it is scientifically proven that people wearing MMO-Champion T-Shirts are 137% more likely to end up in awkward pictures on the front page if they wear them during the Blizzcon. <br>

Patch 4.3 - Chromatic Dragon Pet<br>
A &quot;ChromaticDragonPet&quot; model was added to the PTR with the latest build, it looks pretty cool for the moment but it might be a work in progress. It&apos;s also incredibly big for a companion pet, I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s because the model was just implemented or if it&apos;s intended, wait &amp; see! <br>

Fahrad<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_COMPLETE1_01 - Huh, a lucky blow against an unprepared opponent.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_COMPLETE2_01 - She allowed herself to be defeated. The others will not be so weak.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_COMPLETE3_01 - Indeed, my prince. Hidden in plain sight.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_COMPLETE4_01 - Don&apos;t trust this one, your highness. Disguises, lies, flawless assassinations. No one is that good.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE1_01 - Your highness, we caught this beast snooping around the caves just outside the compound.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE1_02 - Shall we execute him, my prince?<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE1_03 - Yes, sir.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE1_04 - Your first target is here, in the ruins of Gilneas. I&apos;ve lost some of my best men already. Let&apos;s see if you can fare any better.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE1_05 - If he succeeds in looting the whole of Gilneas, there is no telling where he&apos;ll hide next. Now is the time to strike.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE2_01 - We&apos;ve just located her here, in the caverns beneath Karazhan. (Laughs) Fearful for her life, she is researching arcane secrets buried beneath the foundation.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE2_02 - She surrounded herself with a small army of deranged dragon cultists. They may not be right in the head, but they&apos;re well armed and dangerous.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE3_01 - This one? Mingle with the arch-mages of Dalaran? Hah, I&apos;d pay to see that.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE4_01 - My prince, we should leave this place in case they come back to finish the job!<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE4_02 - Your highness! I have never tried to conceal what I am from you.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE4_03 - That is not true.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE4_04 - No, no, I am in control of the voices! They&apos;re here to help me!<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE4_05 - Kill.. they want me to kill you now! Why did you have to go and anger them?!<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE4_06 - You have proven too difficult to control!<br>
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE4_07 - (Death scream.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Mostrasz<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_CUTSCENE_01 - I&apos;m not afraid of you! Wait... who are you?<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_CUTSCENE_02 - But.. but.. Deathwing&apos;s minions may have you killed!<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_CUTSCENE_03 - (screams)<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT01 - Let&apos;s move out, friend. There&apos;s no time to lose.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT02 - Aurastrasza is understandably upset. Under her care was the one black dragon egg that we believe was free of the taint of Deathwing&apos;s corruption.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT03 - And it was stolen away from us by thieves in the night.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT04 - You found for us our only lead. The rogues from Ravenholdt are behind this!<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT05 - Ravenholdt; it just doesn&apos;t make sense! A mongrel band of petty thieves? How did they even know about the egg?<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT06 - We&apos;ll get to the bottom of this. Someone with your skills is exactly what we need.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT07 - What&apos;s the expression? To catch a thief, they say? Hmm?<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT08 - Look at this devastation. These foothills have never recovered from the campaigns of the second and third wars.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT09 - Ruins and debris litter the landscape, and I consider the thieves and assassins of Ravenholdt to be part of that debris.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT10 - Without a state, without a cause.. What drives them, do you wonder?<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT11 - And what posessed them to strike out against the red dragonflight? Madness. We must learn more!<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT12 - We&apos;re almost to Ravenholdt manor.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT13 - If they have the egg, it&apos;s too dangerous to risk an all out assault. You&apos;ll need to sneak in there, find out what they&apos;re up to, and retrieve the egg at any cost.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT14 - Quiet now. We&apos;ll form up a plan within this cave.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_Greeting01 - Let us spring into action.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_Greeting02 - Hello friend.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_Greeting03 - Any news?<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_Greeting04 - What do you have for me?<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH01 - Stay on the ground and stay hidden. I&apos;ll port you back here if you get into any trouble.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH02 - Don&apos;t forget to use your stealth!<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH03 - That&apos;s it, you&apos;ve got this. Keep it up.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH04 - Careful. The front door is too heavily guarded. Hmm. Circle around the back of the manor and maybe we can find another way in.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH05 - Where are you going? The manor is in the other direction!<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH06 - Hmm, it doesn&apos;t look like there&apos;s anything over here. Try circling around to the back of the manor.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH07 - Hah, there are no guards back here. Maybe you can find a way up onto the roof.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH08 - Nice work. Is there a window up there? Look around.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH09 - You did it; you&apos;re in! Now, where would they be keeping the egg? Some place dark, I would imagine. Be careful!<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH_FAIL01 - I&apos;ve got you! That was close.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH_FAIL02 - You need to be careful! They&apos;re on full alert.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH_FAIL03 - Well, that got ugly. You&apos;re lucky I&apos;m here.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH_FAIL04 - You weren&apos;t trying to pick their pockets, were you?<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH_FAIL05 - Gotcha! Let&apos;s try that again.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH_FAIL06 - Are you crazy? They&apos;ll see you if you go flying around in there!<br>
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH_FAIL07 - You can&apos;t fly here! You&apos;ll be spotted for sure!<br>
<br>
<br>
Wrathion<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_COMPLETE1_01 - Excellent work, friend. You&apos;ve proven that a single skilled assassin can strike a decisive blow where a whole army may fail.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_COMPLETE1_02 - If you wish to continue our work, we will need some additional supplies.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_COMPLETE2_01 - Incredible. Few assassins would be clever enough to infiltrate Nalice&apos;s wards and use her own magic against her.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_COMPLETE2_02 - Perhaps. For that reason, we will need to gather more supplies.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_COMPLETE3_01 - Dalaran? He&apos;s been hidden there this whole time.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_COMPLETE4_01 - You slew him right in the purple parlor? Incredible, simply incredible!<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_COMPLETE4_02 - There&apos;s no need to worry, Fahrad. This next mission is quite likely suicide.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_FINAL_QUEST_01 - Don&apos;t underestimate my father. Even if you were to crush his body, the core of his madness and rage will still struggle to destroy you.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_FINAL_QUEST_02 - He will not be defeated until he is utterly annihilated.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_FINAL_QUEST_03 - I wish I could help, but my father is the one dragon I fear.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_FINAL_QUEST_04 - Best of luck, rogue. Whatever the outcome, you are truly a champion.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_01 - That&apos;s right, mortal. The prize you seek no longer sleeps within a shell. Here I am, in the flesh.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_02 - I&apos;m not some trophy for a red dragon&apos;s mantlepiece, and I&apos;m never going back.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_03 - Don&apos;t look so surprised. We dragons are conscious, even within our shells. As I grew, I could hear the plotting and scheming. I was to be born a prisoner. <br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_04 - But I&apos;m one of a kind. A black dragon, raised free from the taint of my father&apos;s corruption. And that&apos;s how I intend to stay -- free.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_05 - Somehow, you managed to elude all of my guards. You slipped in here like a ghost. That makes you valuable to me. Let&apos;s talk.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_06 - You don&apos;t recognize your former prisoner?<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_07 - No, I want him to deliver a message to the red dragonflight.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_08 - Tell them that I am free of my father&apos;s madness, and I will be free of them as well. I am to be left alone. This will be my first and only warning.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_09 - Deathwing&apos;s minions should be afraid of me. Get him out of here!<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_10 - And Fahrad?<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_11 - Break his legs.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_12 - Now then, my new friend. We have much to talk about.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_13 - As you know, black dragons frequently disguise themselves as humanoids in order to tamper with mortal affairs.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_14 - While the house of my mad father collapses around him, the few remaining black dragons have gone into hiding.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_15 - But I can still sense them. My cowardly brothers and sisters will cause untold suffering if we allow them to stay in the shadows.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_16 - Moreover, they are a threat to me.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_17 - That is where you come in. Help us to slay them all, and I will reward you handsomely.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_18 - The dragon you&apos;re looking for goes by the name Creed.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_19 - He&apos;s deluded a group of diseased humans into thinking they can take their land back. He&apos;s poisoned their blood with his own draconic essence.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_20 - If you live through this, I assure you it will be worth it.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE2_01 - The gems you collected will be able to augment the power of the weapons I gave you. But I require another ingredient. It will come from your next target.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE2_02 - Her name is Nalice. And until recently, she stood at Wyrmrest Temple as the representative of the black dragonflight. Now, she&apos;s on the run.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE2_03 - I hope to see you back from this mission alive, but if I do not, I want to say I&apos;ve enjoyed seeing you work. You&apos;re a credit to your race. Good luck.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE3_01 - Fermion is a crafty one, my friend. To flush him out, you&apos;ll have to operate in disguise and hobnob with the elite of Dalaran society.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE3_02 - Succeed here, and our work is nearly done. Good luck, hero.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_01 - Your eyes do not deceive you. The trecherous red dragonflight sought to kill me off. I hope now you see the truth about them.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_02 - I can feel it, as if a dark shadow has been lifted from the land. Dead! My father is dead.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_03 - Champion, you have your reward. But there is one final dragon we need to slay.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_04 - Fahrad! I was just talking about you. The final black dragon. The one who&apos;s been more hidden than any of them.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_05 - Yes, you rescued me while I was still within my egg. And I owe you my life.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_06 - But you are a black dragon, and you share the corruption of all my brothers and sisters.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_07 - Do you deny it? The dark visions, the voices in your head?<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_08 - And what are they telling you now, Fahrad? What do your dark masters whisper?<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_09 - I will never be controlled! The red dragonflight has no idea what they unleashed when they experimented on my egg.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_10 - Hero, strike now! Use your newfound power to finish him!<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_11 - It is done, friend. To my knowledge, I am the only black dragon who remains.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_12 - A new age for mortals has dawned, and heroes like you are among the vanguard.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_13 - I must go now, disappear.<br>
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_14 - Perhaps we will meet again. I hope we find ourselves on the same side.<br>
VO_Wrathion_Greeting01 - I do not share my father&apos;s madness.<br>
VO_Wrathion_Greeting02 - A new era is beginning.<br>
VO_Wrathion_Greeting03 - I must remain hidden so that I remain free.<br>
VO_Wrathion_Greeting04 - I believe an individual can have an enormous impact on the world.<br>
VO_Wrathion_Greeting05 - You do not want to make it on to my list.</div></div>
