Patch 7.1.5 - Volunteer Guard Day<br>
Volunteer Guard Day (http://ptr.wowdb.com/world-events/635-volunteer-guard-day) allows you to help defend your faction&apos;s city and take on the appearance of a guard.<br>
<br>
<br>
Approach any guard in your faction&apos;s city and /salute them<br>
<br>
Alliance: Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, The Exodar, Stormshield<br>
Horde: Orgrimmar, Thunder Bluff, Undercity, Silvermoon, or Warspear<br>
<br>
You will take on the appearance of the guard you interacted with, along with a 24H Volunteer City Guard (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/231193-volunteer-city-guard) buff.<br>
While you have the buff, City Invaders will spawn when you are in town and attack you. Defeat them to increase your kill count.<br>
 Killing 10 attackers adds the &quot;Defender of X&quot; to your buff, 50 for &quot;Heroic Defender&quot;, and 250 for &quot;Mythic Defender&quot;. This doesn&apos;t appear to have any actual effect.<br>
This buff persists through death and changing of zones, but will be lost when entering an instance.<br>
You can get the buff back again by saluting a guard. Losing the buff will not reset your kill counter.<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
PvP<br>
probably a silly question. But will my honor talents reset at the end of season? Will I have to grind them again?<br>
Honor talents will not be reset. There will, however, be new Prestige levels to earn! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/805848099444772864))<br>
<br>
Are the Prestige PvP mounts going away with the season?<br>
Nope! The current Prestige mounts will still be obtainable in Season 2. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/805848400641961984))<br>
<br>
Someone said that in PvP only the first 34 weap ranks unlocked count, not the bonus ranks but don&apos;t see that in blue post? T or F?<br>
This is correct. Ranks 35+ do not apply in PvP instances. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/805848633434214400))<br>
<br>
When you switch factions, is it 50 wins in the bracket you want the title in or 50 wins in either 2v2 3v3 or RBGs<br>
50 wins in the specific bracket. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/805848813843857409))<br>
<br>
Will your current prestige rank reset, or will you just continue prestiging the new levels?<br>
Prestige ranks will not reset. If you&apos;re already at max Prestige, you&apos;ll be able to immediately move on to the new ranks. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/805851612002459648))<br>
<br>
Lore<br>
Can Fel Magic be used to Heal as well as Corrupt? Like Shivarra Priestesses who Heal?<br>
definitely. If your a fel based creature. Otherwise it&apos;s going to leave a mark. (Alex_Afrasiabi (https://twitter.com/Alex_Afrasiabi/status/804857577183973376))<br>

Death Knights: what makes you feel like a DK? Do you consider yourself kind of evil? Would you raise a soul against its will? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/805228118105436160))<br>
<br>
Priests: how does shadow fit in with the Light for you? Are shadow priests corrupted? What IS discipline? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/805233291557146624))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
How do you think players should provide feedback on games that&#x2019;s useful for developers? Do you find player change suggestions useful, or should they focus more on explaining their problems instead?<br>
So there is this (somewhat insulting) maxim that gets floated around that players are supposedly great at identifying problems and terrible at suggesting solutions. I don&#x2019;t like repeating it, because it has this unhelpful implication that players are stupid. <br>
<br>
Players aren&#x2019;t stupid. They just don&#x2019;t know the whole code base. I don&#x2019;t know the whole code base. The tech director probably doesn&#x2019;t know the whole code base.<br>
<br>
Usually, the actual issue is that in software development, it&#x2019;s often really hard for people not intimately familiar with a specific part of the code to predict how easy or hard an idea will be to implement. You get better at it of course, but I&#x2019;ve been doing this for almost 20 years now, and I still get surprised when solution X takes 4 months to implement and nearly-identical solution Y takes 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
Players are about as far removed from the code base as one can be, so often the solutions they come up with aren&#x2019;t feasible, sometimes for very pedantic reasons.<br>
<br>
There are other reasons the suggestion won&#x2019;t work. Maybe it just feels wildly inconsistent to the rest of the game. Maybe it would cause a lot of bugs. Maybe it would be easy to exploit. Maybe it would cause weird player behavior.<br>
<br>
So, yes, strictly speaking if you want to be as efficient as possible in your feedback, focus on explaining the problem. State the problem very clearly. Don&#x2019;t assume the reader, even a dev, understands your shorthand. You might end up talking about two totally different things. Then state the consequences for the problem. That&#x2019;s it. Suggestions on how to fix it are probably most useful as a way for us to reverse engineer what the specific problem is, but again, it&#x2019;s more efficient just to state that clearly in the first place.<br>
<br>
As an aside, I&#x2019;ll risk making another sweeping generalization here and opine that player feedback is nearly always too long. There must be this other maxim somewhere that the length of a post is somehow proportional to the strength of the post, but that&#x2019;s just not true in my experience. Players love bullets. Posts with lots of bullets get upvoted, as if the writer must certainly be an authority on a topic if they can come up with so many things that are busted or so many reasons why something being busted is bad. But longer isn&#x2019;t automatically better. Longer is automatically less efficient however. You are probably burying your good stuff in a sea of words.<br>
<br>
We are busy. You don&#x2019;t want to make us digest a wall of text just to distill out the really critical information. You want to write like Hemingway: use just enough words to get your point across, and no more.
