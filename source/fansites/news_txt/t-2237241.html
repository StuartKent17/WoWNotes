Five years ago, I received a phone call from Blizzard offering me the chance of a lifetime&#x2014;a position on the World of Warcraft team.<br>
<br>
Simply put, this is my favorite game of all time, and working on it these past five years has been a dream come true. I have learned so much from the women and men who make it and everyone who plays it. I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to work on a game that so many people around the world are so passionate about.<br>
<br>
A few weeks ago, I was offered a new opportunity at Blizzard that I&#x2019;m really excited about. Tomorrow is my last day working on World of Warcraft.<br>
<br>
As a longtime player, I couldn&apos;t be more excited about what the future has in store for World of Warcraft. In particular, the PvP team remains hard at work on some incredible plans. I fully expect that the best years of World of Warcraft PvP are ahead of us.<br>
<br>
Thank you to everyone involved with World of Warcraft, from the development team to the players, for letting me be a part of this game&apos;s community. I consider it a great privilege.<br>
