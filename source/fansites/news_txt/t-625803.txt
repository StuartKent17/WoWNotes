The Mounts page http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=824 has been updated once again and the Grand Black War Mammoth is now properly flagged as a rare drop from Archavon http://www.wowwiki.com/Archavon_the_Stone_Watcher in Lake Wintergrasp.

MMO-Champion - Now Recruiting!

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/november/MMO-Champ-Logo-207px.pngMMO-Champion is recruiting again! The first phase of recruitment wasn't as successful as expected, mostly because the timing was pretty bad asking people to work on WotLK content right after the end of the alpha probably wasn't the best idea. We're looking for the following people:

Moderators
Most of the time the forums are a warzone, and we definitely need a lot more moderators. There are just a few requirements if you want to apply:

Decent English writing skills
Your forum account must be older than one month. 
Preferably, a post count above 50 would be nice. Mostly to check your personality on forums, having 1000+ posts won't help 
Don't be stupid.

And that's it, depending on the amount of answers I get I might add a few requirements but I don't want to scare anyone for the moment. 


News writers
This one is a bit complicated, technically I'm just looking for people to bring additional content to the site, but I wouldn't mind having a few people as a backup just in case. Let's say that if you're very good previous experience on a WoW News site would be a great thing we're also interested in regular front page newsers. Including the easy blue posts! 

We're not interested in blog-like posts, there are tons of WoW blogs and the objective isn't to compete with them. 
No, you can't apply just to list blue posts once a day and pretend that you're working hard. I already do that. 
Having a decent experience in datamining/MPQ Browsing/etc... will help.
I'm also looking for people willing to write articles on interesting videos, addons, and all that kind of "side-news". 

I can't really go further into details because your job is also to find interesting stuff by yourself. Basically, if you think you can contribute regularly to the front page, we need you!


Content updaters
This one is easy to explain, your job is to work update and create the pages any dungeon, items, factions pages after each content patch as of today, it also includes all the outdated WotLK pages I still have on the site. You will need:

Basic understanding of HTML is necessary, that's something you can learn very easily and it won't take long to have someone explain it to you.
Basic understanding of SVN http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_software Again, that's something we can explain in less than 10 lines 
Decent English writing skills, autonomy, etc ...

There aren't many requirements I can add here, again if you think you can contribute to the site just apply. Obviously, a sample of your work will be necessary


How to apply
That's easy, send a mail to 
mmoc.recruit@gmail.com with: 

A few RL information about you, nothing too detailed. 
The position you're applying for in the subject of the mail, please also include your nickname Like "[Content updater] - AwesomeDwarf"
A sample of your work, update something on the site, write an article, anything else ... You're going to start working on it sooner or later, better start with your application to avoid wasting time. Of course it doesn't apply to forum moderators

Only the sample of your work is important here, I got hundred of answers for the first recruitment phase and sending non-WoW related articles just doesn't work.
