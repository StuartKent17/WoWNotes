Personal Loot in Dungeons Restored<br>
Thanks for all the feedback on these changes. As a team, we do prefer personal loot as a solution for Dungeon Finder groups, which is why we modified and extended the system we&#x2019;ve had in place for Raid Finder. We heard from sources both within our team and the community that the experience of defeating a boss and no ceremony beyond three gold on its corpse, or the possibility of finishing an entire dungeon without seeing any items, felt flat and even a bit broken. Based on those concerns, we decided to roll back a system that had been in place for a week to a system that had been in use for years, while we continued to polish and refine the personal loot system to deliver an optimal experience to players. However, we underestimated the impact and positive elements of personal loot, in terms of reducing contention and drama in random match made groups.<br>
<br>
We now have a hotfix in the works that will do two things:<br>
<br>
The default loot system for Dungeon Finder groups will once again be Personal, instead of Need Before Greed. Full premade groups that prefer the latter system will be able to select it manually, as always. We&apos;re increasing loot yield from the final boss of each dungeon.<br>
With Personal loot active, each player in a group will now always receive an item from the final boss. With Need Before Greed active, the boss will now drop 3 items to be shared among the group as desired, up from 2 previously.<br>
<br>
<br>

Game Time Being Applied<br>
The 5 days of free game time mentioned in the letter from J. Allen Brack is on its way out. As a reminder this is for players in the Americas, Oceania, and Europe who had active subscriptions as of Friday, November 14. We expect the process to take a full day to apply to all accounts that met the requirement. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/351189-game-time-being-applied/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15353875589?page=1#1))<br>
<br>
Teaching Followers New Traits<br>
There&apos;s been some confusion regarding the various items you can use that allow you to change a trait on one of your Garrisons followers, so we wanted to clarify how these items work.<br>
<br>
If you use an item such as the Supreme Manual of Dance (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118474-supreme-manual-of-dance) or the Hearthstone Strategy Guide (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118475-hearthstone-strategy-guide), the targeted follower will gain the trait associated with the on-use item, and lose a random trait which cannot be selected or changed after the fact. Currently, the tooltips for these items are not specific enough about the randomness associated with their outcome, and we&apos;re working on getting them adjusted.<br>
<br>
So if you&apos;re now missing a follower with a specific trait you want or need, remember that you can level your Inn or Tavern to tier 2 to gain access to an NPC who will hunt down new followers. When one becomes available, you can then limit your search based on the traits you desire.
