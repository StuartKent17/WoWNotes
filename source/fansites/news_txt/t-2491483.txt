MagicFind2019-06-11, 10:56 PMAn Update on the Future of MMO-Champion
We’re excited to welcome MMO-Champion to the Magic Find family and are excited to work together! We're a small independent team of people who worked on gaming websites in the past including MMO-Champion and are teaming up to build up new communities together.

Over the next few months we will do our best to ramp up work on the website and work together with all of you to improve performance and work on developing new ideas. 

Acquisitions are always a bit strange and come with a lot of questions, so we'll do our best to answer them and we hope we’ll build trust over time and improve MMO-Champion together. 

If you have any suggestions or issues you’ve identified on the website, now is definitely a great time to let us know about them!
