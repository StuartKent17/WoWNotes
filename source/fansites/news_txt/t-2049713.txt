Quests

The item Gods and Monsters has been restored to its proper function, and will now be sent to players who complete the Gods and Monsters Achievement, allowing them to start the quest “Gods and Monsters”.




Invasion Experience Changes
We see that this has been noticed already, but for more clarity - the frequency of invasions has been tripled, and you will have more invasions to participate in throughout the day. To compensate for this, we have reduced XP awarded for each individual invasion.

Remember that as we move closer to the launch of Legion, you can expect an increased Legion presence in both numbers and cadence as their invasion grows stronger.

See you on the battlefield!
