Patch 5.3 - Blood in the Snow Scenario Intro<br>
Some of the new scenarios in Patch 5.3 will have an intro by Lorewalker Cho, starting with Blood in the Snow. Unfortunately the new scenarios are still not open for testing, so you cannot progress further than this one yet. <br>

Ask the Devs - Upcoming PvP changes<br>
Current Status<br>
LOCKED &#x2014; Questions and voting will begin soon. <br>
<br>
Topic<br>
The topic for this Ask the Devs is, &#x201C;PvP changes on the PTR&#x201D;. <br>
Be sure to stay on topic, as questions that stray from this won&apos;t be answered.<br>
<br>
How it works:<br>
Voting will begin on 09/04/13 and end on 11/04/13. The thread will be open for 48 hours, after which time it will be locked and you&#x2019;ll no longer be able to post or vote for questions to be sent to the developers. Once the thread has been locked, we&#x2019;ll tally up the votes and send the top questions off to the World of Warcraft developers. We&#x2019;ll provide answers directly from the developers during the following week. Watch the blog for their responses!<br>
<br>
The Rules:<br>
There&#x2019;s a limit of one question per post. Stay on topic. Questions that are not related to the chosen topic will not be sent to the developers, even if they&#x2019;re rated highly. Only post questions in the Ask the Devs thread &#x2013; discussions are not permitted. If you would like to discuss the questions or a related matter, please do so in another thread. A question being highly rated does not guarantee that it will be answered. We will, however, try to get as many questions answered as possible. &#x201C;Disliking&#x201D; a post will not count toward its tally. Only &#x201C;likes&#x201D; will be counted.<br>
<br>
Some Tips:<br>
Don&#x2019;t post or vote for questions that you know we cannot or will not answer. This Q&amp;A is designed to give you more insight into the changes that are happening on the PTR, not to make announcements about future projects, expansions, or release dates. This includes questions not related to the Ask the Devs topic. Make your questions as short and concise as possible so that they&#x2019;re easy to understand for us and other players. &#x201C;Like&#x201D; a post if you&#x2019;d like to vote for it. Don&#x2019;t bother &#x201C;disliking&#x201D; a post, as this will not influence our decision on which questions are sent to the developers. Vote for any of the questions you&#x2019;d like to see answered, but keep in mind the above tips.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Small Client Patches<br>
As you may have noticed there have been a few small patches being downloaded and installed by the World of Warcraft launcher. These are part of a new bit of tech we&#x2019;ve been testing that allows us to quickly release small client-side patches without needing to build and release a large scale patch. These allow us to now make client-side changes quickly and easily, very similar to the server-side hotfixes we&#x2019;ve become used to for all these years. We treat them the same as server-side hotfixes, so they&#x2019;ll be noted in the usual hotfix blog as it&#x2019;s updated.<br>

UI / Addons<br>
Hey Greg! Any chance you guys are going to break Feat of Strengths into subcategories? I currently have 55 and It overwhelms.<br>
Gratz! We think our achievement UI needs some work, including filtering. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301563639318593536))<br>
<br>
need to make ui able to see absorbs from ss,da, &amp; pws to let me know when they are capped to make sure I dont overuse.<br>
You can see absorbs in 5.2. You can&apos;t see their caps because we couldn&apos;t solve that to our liking but mods might. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/304336625247322112))<br>
<br>
Yo GC, would love to see a in game tabard u.i similar to titles. Drop down menu &gt; tabard &gt; check to equip or display none.<br>
Agree. We just have to solve a few that have a clicky effect like teleports. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/304337185031745537))<br>
<br>
If you can redesign WoW from scratch, do you still think it&apos;s good to support custom addons?<br>
Yes, though we might have aimed more for supporting more customization and less automation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315490212098764800))<br>
