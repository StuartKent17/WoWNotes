Boubouille2008-09-06, 01:32 PMReminder - Team Passes for MLG Dallas WoW 3v3 Tournament  on October 3rd - 5th are now available ! You can buy them here  !

I guess we can't really update the main 8905 post with new items for the next few days, just like for the last build this post will be dedicated to new items found in dungeons. Stay tuned for more updates. 

Updates - Sunday 7th
00:00 CET - Naxxramas 10 Players - 8 More items, including 3 weapons from Kel'thuzad.
11:00 CET - Changed the layout of the list, added specs, moved subtypes to the beginning of the line. It should be much more readable now.
10:00 CET - Naxxramas 10 Players - 25 Items added, items tagged with a K drop from Kel'thuzad, items tagged with a T are buyable with the badges dropping from bosses here. 

Premonition  managed to clear Naxxramas 10 Players, congratulations to them ! Also, a group of members of Premonition  and Vis Maior  completed the 25 Players version of the instance ! 


   

In its current state, Naxxramas 25 Players is only itemized with loot from the 10 Players version, that's why you didn't see any updates on them. However the achievement works perfectly and the guilds getting the Realm First kill on Kel'thuzad will see their achievement broadcasted to the world. Including players not in the same zone/continent


 

Updates - Saturday 6th
23:00 CET - Racial Skills - Racial Skills are getting changed in an upcoming build. See the full preview of new racial skills in this post by Kalgan
