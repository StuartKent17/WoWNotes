The two last ones are from the phase 2 of the fight where you fight the legendary weapons to be able to loot them. (Had to blur some conversations, the annoying lvl 1 is obviously not me. *cough*)<br>

For The Horde (http://www.for-the-horde.de) went in Coilfang with a GM and had a try on the new Vashj .... They dropped something very interesting. (It wasn&apos;t a legit kill, according to a member of the raid the encounter still needs massive tuning to be manageable with the 2.1.0 consumables changes)<br>

So you might ask ... What&apos;s the use ? Easy, you can use this scroll to attune someone to Serpentshrine Cavern instantly, no quest, nothing (You use it like any other scroll, if you still can&apos;t really understand, think about a Scroll of Stamina). Kael&apos;thas will also drop an item of the same kind.<br>

The other loots were (+ Nether Vortexes, Tier 5 tokens)<br>
[Coral Band of the Revived]<br>
[Ring of Endless Coils]</div></div>
