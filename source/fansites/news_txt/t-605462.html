&lt;a name=&quot;noteupdate&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Update #2 - Patch notes have been updated on both EU and US official sites and Kalgan made an interesting blue post regarding class balance in Arena. <br>
In Memoriam: Gary Gygax<br>
Blizzard Entertainment would like to dedicate the patch in memory of Gary Gygax. His work on D&amp;D was an inspiration to us in many ways and helped spark our passion for creating games of our own. As avid D&amp;D players and fellow game developers, we were all saddened by the news of his passing; we feel we&#x2019;ve lost a true adventuring companion. Thanks for everything and farewell, Gary. You will be missed.<br>

Class balance in Arenas<br>
No other warlock nerfs are planned for 2.4. One of the things we look at is class representation in arenas (although normalized for class popularity). In this particular chart, a value of 100% means the class is represented as we&apos;d expect, a value over 100% means the class is represented that much more often than we&apos;d expect, a value below 100% means they&apos;re represented less than we&apos;d want (obviously this chart doesn&apos;t include a spec breakdown in any way).<br>
<br>
<br>
one other detail regarding the chart, this one is set at 2200+ rating.<br>
<br>

Locks are doing pretty well overall, but what had us worried was that it appeared to us a month ago or so as though warlocks were on an uptrend. However, the evidence is strong that that trend is reversing, which means significant nerfs aren&apos;t really what we want right now (we really don&apos;t know where those numbers will settle down).<br>
<br>
Update - The Twin Eredars are killable again, and we&apos;ll probably see a few new items from them ! The first of them is [Book of Highborne Hymns] (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/bookofhighbornehymns.jpg)<br>
