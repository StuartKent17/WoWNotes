Armory Stats - Legendary Quest Line Achievements
Today we are taking a look at the legendary quest achievement completion rate of players. Now that achievements are account wide, we can group characters by account and get an idea of what percentage of players not characters have completed an achievement.

In this case, the final achievement requires you to obtain a legendary cloak, kill Garrosh, and finally complete a quest. This means that the number of players who have the legendary cloak is slightly higher than the number who have the final achievement, as some players have killed Garrosh, have the cloak, but never did the quest. 

The data used today is a sample of 5.7 million characters from 2 million accounts, with at least one character on the account that was active after Nov 15. The sample is slightly biased, as players who are not in a guild are much less likely to appear in our sample. You can leave suggestions for future stat posts in the comments!

Armory Stats - Legendary Weapon Feat of Strength Achievements

Blue Tweets
We have finally gone through all of the tweets made by Ghostcrawler https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/ while he was still a developer. Now he is off on a beach somewhere https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412692088895983616/photo/1/large, but still offering his opinion https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/414819543597334528 on Twitter. 


<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="http://static.polldaddy.com/p/7666760.js"></script>
<noscript><a href="http://polldaddy.com/poll/7666760/">Would you like to see Ghostcrawler tweets? Not mixed in with the Blue Tweets, but in their own section</a></noscript>

If you want to follow or contact the developers on Twitter, take a look at Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon PvE, Holinka https://twitter.com/holinka PvP, Chris Robinson https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson Art, Dave Kosak https://twitter.com/davekosak Story, Dave Maldonado https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo Game Design.

Classes 
Base damage/healing on spells is removed too. All from scaling. Equal scaling for all! Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407642737664483328
Curious, naked casters have 0 spellpower now; will base intellect give spellpower in 6.0?
Likely, yes. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407985649023582208

How do you decide which spells to remove from classes? Consecration and auras were core features to paladins. Totems to shamans
It's tough; every ability is special to somebody. Generally, cut what takes up keybinds, but isn't needed to make it fun. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407973492550688768
I realize that's rather vague. It's a very subjective question. Preserving and improving gameplay is the primary goal here. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407973701498322944

Would you gentleman be willing to touch on what abilities, or types of abilities you've looking at removing in WoD?
We're currently exploring removing CC abilities and redundant DPS/healing cooldowns. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407588872864808960
if you remove cc abilities it's gonna take 95% of coordination out of the game.. just run in and do dmg..
He didn't mean *all* CC abilities. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407593422715764736
Yeah "some CC abilities" Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407595446740074496
Care to give one example you guys are discussing?
Not really :-D This is a case where if you only see one class's changes, that class will freak. Whole picture needed Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407655696268681217
Can you give us the whole picture? 
Soonâ„¢. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407656872594784256
Really looking forward to what you come up with nevertheless.
It will be iterative and obviously balance won't be perfect from the start. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407659455258456064
Hoping for an agile beta testing phase! 
It will be important for us to get a lot of testing & feedback during beta. Want to encourage alot of participation Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407690134969020417

removing any CC is a design shift away from strategic dungeon gameplay. Warlords of Faceroll
I think you misunderstood what Holinka was saying. See further tweets with clarification. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407632059180388353
how else can 'removing some CC abilities' be interpreted? Are there just too many?
Yes, most definitely. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407632870929219584
Jumping from [Removing some of the tons of CC] to [Dungeons no longer require strategy] is a humongous incorrect leap. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407634070944743424
this would impact both pve and pvp, yes? Will dungeons require CC? Strategy?
There will still be CC, and it will still be just as strategically valuable in dungeons. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407634289765797889
as a prot warrior feeling marginalized in my role, removing CC only exacerbates those feelings. Like tanks only matter 4 raiding
Not at all the case. Tanks are definitely needed for dungeons. Not sure how this affects that at all. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407635301029273601
tanks in 5 mans are only relevant in the beginning, gear overtakes and healing and dps survivability reign.
A I'd disagree with that until there's an absolutely massive gear difference. B What does removing some CC have to do with that? Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407636103093444608

What do you think about squishing mana to a solid 1000? Huge numbers make no sense when it's static anyway!
It'll be squished to something comparable to health. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407608379981299712

Note that rogues don't have redundant dps cooldowns, that is all!
We actually like DPS cooldowns that have gameplay changes e.g. Shadowdance than "Moar damage" Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407656752532836352

Absolutely, we saw that in Mists but I'm just cautioning that I'm afraid of where it may lead. I really like AM.
We really like Active Mitigation as well; it's turned out quite well. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407603572029665280

a while back mr said hunters / rogues would get an overhaul next x-pac, just wondering if still happening? Thanks!
"Overhaul", no. We want to better distinguish their different specs. That's not an "overhaul" at all, though. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407602399398752256

Why does encounter design come first, rather than class balance?Encounters don't require insane dmg> players don't need insane dmg
They are pretty interwoven and there's a lot of back and forth between the two teams. The class team has a lot of customers. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407589134400634880

I never want to go back to Jab Jab Uplift, I just like how the two styles integrate easily.
The problem is cherrypicking. Don't want to allow you to pick the best parts of both. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407609885275078656
Thus, we need to have some cost to switching modes. Doesn't take much; 1 GCD may suffice. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407610171888660480
Would FW still maintain the "DPS healer" model that we were sold on? Will it be "viable?"
Yes. Separate stance allows us to balance it separately. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407610884203114496
Is this going to make mistweaving gimped w/o stance swapping to fist?
Gimped? At what? Maximum HPS is purely Mistweaving, no Fistweaving. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407611435053613056

So to clarify... If I want to heal I have to channel?
If you want to do maximum HPS, yes, Mistweavers gameplay involves channeling. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407610571354165248

Just to add to this, what do you plan on doing with fistweaving?
Both are large concerns that we intend to address. Preserving Fistweaving, but it'll be a separate stance. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407606761344868353
Wait wait wait, by seperate stance do you mean SotFT? Will FW be energy based?
No, new stance. No, still mana. No, not at all like Chakra. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407608081556582400
Are you aiming to keep the same seamless fusion between DPS and healing. I miss 5.0 fw. 
What do you mean by 'seamless fusion'? If you mean Jab-Jab-Uplift, no. No cherrypicking. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407608846828326912

Hiya! Quick Question, so you have fistweaving, and atonement. Any plans for a paladin seems a natch or druid version in WoD?
Druids already have it in Dream of Cenarius. Seal of Faith is doing that for Paladins, though in a different way. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407985137645666304
Seal of Faith=terrible talent, scrap it
I suppose that's better feedback than none at all, but reasoning and thoughts would be even better. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408005167259217920
Unless you give holy a reliable baseline dps HP generator. /4
Assume you have access to all of the spec's builders/finishers that you want. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408009266130190336
Holy does not have a reliable dps builder.We have to spec SH for Judgment to grant HP&crusader strike is not reliable
How is Crusader Strike not reliable? Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408010230014816256
We don't have melee mechanics immunity for one.
OK, what if you did, with Seal of Faith? Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408010898716901377
I'd spec the talent to gain said immunity and use Insight anyway.
I sincerely doubt that you'd give up your other lvl 100 talents for that. Could make it only work while active. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408011760776400896
Can seal swap dance if required on dangerous mechanic. Besides lvl 100 talents for H Pala = bad/situational
Let's try to back up a step. Don't get stuck in 'how' nitpicking. Feedback on the general intent of the talent? Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408015942384234496
The biggest issue is that, as a paladin, DPS-based healing doesn't feeling natural.
How so? It'd be new functionality that you're not used to, but that could be said for anything. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408012379369115648
Talenting into Stance Dancing just sounds horrible period in both feel and power.
The intent is no dancing. It's a committed thing. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408018020800270336
You can't really expect a healer not to dance, too many variables in a fight
You can expect them not to dance if they aren't able to. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408018252023885824
