Patch 7.0.3 Hotfixes - September 26
Additional class tuning changes were added to the hotfix notes:
Classes
Developer’s Notes: After carefully considering the constructive feedback we’ve received over the weekend, we’ve made some revisions to this week’s tuning. The class changes listed in this hotfix update, as well as those from the previous update will be applied during weekly maintenance in each region. Note that several changes from the previous update have been altered or removed, which is indicated by a strikethrough in the notes below.

 Demon Hunter Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Havoc

Bloodlet Talent now deals 150% of initial Throw Glaive damage.



 Mage Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Arcane

Quickening Talent’s maximum stacks are now 50, and it will not refresh its duration once at 50 stacks.



 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Shadow

Mind Sear damage increased by 80% and Insanity generation increased by 50%.
Mind Flay damage increased by 20%.
Mind Spike damage increased by 28%.
Void Ray maximum stacks reduced to 4.

Developers’ Notes: Given the damage increase to Mind Sear, Mind Flay, and Mind Spike, this still results in an overall increase to the value of the talent.

Voidform stacks no longer increase while Dispersion is active.

Developers’ Notes: We would prefer that Surrender to Madness not be as dominant as it is, and that it can’t be extended for quite so long. However, addressing this further would require significant changes to the spec beyond what we want to do in a tuning pass at this time. We will look for an opportunity to take a more comprehensive look at this issue in a future patch.




 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Queen Ascendant Artifact trait is no longer consumed when a queued healing spell is immediately triggered.


 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Fixed a bug that prevented Rain of Fire from always doing all 8 ticks of damage on PvE and PvP targets.


 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Arms

Tactician proc rate increased by 15%.
Hamstring no longer procs Tactician.
Exploit the Weakness Artifact Trait bonus reduced to 4% per point.



NPCs

Suramar NPCs should no longer remove a player’s stealth at the start of their Arcane Investigation casting.
Interacting with Nomi should now take priority when his area is crowded.


Professions

Engineering: The Reaves version of the Failure Detection Pylon should now work properly.


PvP

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Strike from the Shadows is now a snare, instead of a daze.




Patch 7.0.3 Hotfixes - September 23
Several of the previously listed hotfixes were altered or removed. The rest of the original hotfixes still will be applied. 
Classes
 Demon Hunter Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Havoc

Throw Glaive damage reduced by 30%.
Bloodlet Talent now deals 100% of initial Throw Glaive damage.



 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Shadow

Mind Sear damage and Insanity generation increased by 50%.
Voidform stacks no longer increase while Dispersion and Void Torrent are active. 

Note: These abilities prevent Insanity drain from increasing while active, which effectively reduces the Insanity drain for the entire remainder the current Voidform. This was proving to be too powerful, so we’re now making sure that the damage bonus and Insanity drain from Voidform remain in sync.

The benefit of Mass Hysteria Artifact Trait is now capped at 100%. 

Note: We want it to be rewarding when you’re able to maintain Surrender to Madness for an extremely long time, but the amount of damage this trait was contributing in those circumstances was excessive.

Arms

Exploit the Weakness Artifact Trait bonus reduced to 3% per point.

Skinning and Mob Tapping
We agree that the way this works at present isn't ideal and can be quite frustrating. It's something we want to fix, but it's quite a complicated issue to tackle so we don't have a good estimate on when any fix might happen. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Legion Reception
I appreciate the post, but I don't think there's a point for this discussion to continue.

If you pay attention to the majority of our community, on these forums, on social media, on our fansites, and in-game, reaction to Legion is overwhelmingly positive and a large majority of the player-base is having a pretty great time. In fact, I haven't seen so many people happy with such large aspects of the game since mid-Wrath.

We appreciate people's feedback, but there's a point where we disagree - and this is it.

Closing.

Edit: I'm the first to admit the our game isn't perfect, and that therein, Legion isn't either, but that does not herald the death of WoW/Legion, and talking in circles about that doesn't help the community. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
