If you're in Ashran, we think it's okay to bring 4 friends along with you. But bringing 39 creates an unfair environment. holinka 
Certainly happy that new communities have sprung up and new friendships have been formed. But not at the expense of fairplay. holinka 
Unfortunately, a few people have circumvented those restrictions and we've had to create additional measures. holinka 
I am not sure I understand. So working together as a team is frowned upon in an MMO?
Seems like you're twisting my words. holinka 

Why no just remove the Ashran debuff from the game? take less code hrs, Please?
We think it's important that all players that enter Ashran have an equal opportunity to compete. holinka 
idk if you've been to ashran but they all seem extremely one sided, mostly in favor of alliance
I receive an equal number of "Horde always wins" and "Alliance always wins" complaints. holinka 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
which is sad. Player insight into the the why's of development is great, makes the decisions feel less arbitrary
Exactly. So maybe let's give up on the whole petition to get someone fired strategy. Autocorrect said "furred" lol. OccupyGStreet 

If you aren’t controversial, either you’re a puppet or you do nothing important.
That may be the case, but some companies view social media as a distraction, so being controversial is a net loss. OccupyGStreet
