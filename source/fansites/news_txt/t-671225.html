Abyssal Shatter Hotfixed to Live Servers!<br>
A very interesting change was hotfixed to live servers today, Enchanting: Abyssal Shatter (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69412/abyssal-shatter/) is now available from your local Enchanting Trainer!!<br>

I won&apos;t try to link it to my enchanting AH guide released 2 days ago (it&apos;s all a conspiracy against me, I know it!) and I will post the results I got from a few shatters I did on live servers. <br>
