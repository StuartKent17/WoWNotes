PvP<br>
How large will the 6.1 Ashran teams be? (40v40?etc) If too big, everyone going for one event will DESTROY fps due to server lag.<br>
yup something we&apos;ll keep an eye on (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/568246654081454081))<br>
<br>
Wargame Battlegrounds currently can only be entered with EXP-ON. Can we address this bug?<br>
we&apos;ll investigate it. We have to ensure that nothing in wargames grants you XP. Need to be thorough. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/568548974149238784))<br>
And to clarify, wargame arenas with XP-off is fine. It&apos;s just the wargame bgs that bug.<br>
thanks for the information (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/568551718041964544))<br>
