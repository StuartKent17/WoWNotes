Warcraft Movie Cast Announcement<br>
Legendary announced (https://twitter.com/Legendary/status/413461860550070272) that Daniel Wu (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0943079/) and Clancy Brown (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000317/) will also be joining the Warcraft movie cast. Daniel Wu recently appeared in Europa Report and Clancy Brown regularly appears in and does voices for TV shows. It isn&apos;t his first time working on a Warcraft project though, as he was Thrall (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ6tg1Id6-c&amp;list=PL780265A4FFFD41E8#t=3) in the cancelled Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_Adventures:_Lord_of_the_Clans) game.<br>

Warlords of Draenor Music<br>
Is there going to be any new music in WoD? I find it surprising that nobody has asked this question. I love the music in the game and wondering if they&apos;ve kept up to the scale and quality of previous expansions. <br>
As always, you can expect some new music in the expansion. I couldn&apos;t answer as to how much yet, but if you look back over the years, you&apos;ll see that we&apos;ve added many hours of music on a fairly consistent basis. Also, being able to see the Draenei and Karabor in a new light should be illuminating to the auditory system. We&apos;ll do what we can to provide any sneak listens or insights we can along the path to the release of the expansion.

Warlords of Draenor Timeline<br>
I guess im bothered that actions in this past, wont affect present day. it&apos;s considered &quot;separate&quot;.<br>
Iron Horde orcs are pouring through the Dark Portal into your home. It will absolutely be affecting your present day... and you were just starting to make a sandwich. Jerks.

Legendary Cloak Effort<br>
The point of this thread is to state.... this is by far the most complcated time consuming Legendary ever in this game.<br>
Hah, well thanks for laying it out visually. I think we like how it worked out in essence, ultimately having something for even the LFR player to work toward over a long period of time is a great goal to have for people. Definitely a lot of lessons learned on how we can make steps feel less grindy, and maybe make the experience more cohesive. But having that kind of Legendary doesn&apos;t necessarily preclude us from also having a Legendary that&apos;s maybe class specific and more of a personal challenge like Fangs, or something like the Warlock green fire quest. We don&apos;t think it necessarily has to be one or the other.

Character / Items<br>
That&apos;s an answer to a different question. Currently spirit does nothing for mage, but something for SPriest.<br>
We allowed the Shadow conversion in a weak moment, but they had alternatives. Balance and Elemental did not. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403952196883972096))<br>
<br>
Why the sweeping itemization changes for WoD? Lack of Agi/Str on secondary pieces halves the power.<br>
So we double the amount of attack power on an item? That&apos;s an easy tweak, not a reason to dislike the system IMO. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405462190561308672))<br>
AGI also increases crit. Without AGI on 1/3 of equipment this a major loss in effectiveness.<br>
Or we could just boost crit chance. Again, these seem to be easily solved details and not a reason to reject the design. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405498738749108224))<br>
<br>
Unsure you&apos;re best to ask this, but: Will all of Draenor be explorable (achievement-wise) at expansion launch? Or not til 6.1?<br>
All at launch. Is this related to flying? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405464558090739712))<br>
<br>
So since healer armour will be shared with dps, will the &quot;Bonus&quot; random stats affect healers too? Multistrike, cleave, etc.<br>
Yes. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407313720138690561))<br>
is the cleave stat going to affect healers and the way they heal?<br>
The idea is it could heal nearby targets like the SoO trinket. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407313167367168000))<br>
<br>
Simple question. Will secondary stats be random on gear in WoD too? Chest of Awesome always has haste + mastery off 1st boss?<br> 
For a raid boss drop, the secondary stats will likely be the same every time. May not be the case of other sources of loot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405460435609976832))<br>
<br>
Are Dodge and Parry getting rolled into Armor specifically as a stat?<br>
No. Tanks will have a fixed amount of dodge and parry, perhaps with CDs or procs that buff it temporarily. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405461435594969089))<br>
