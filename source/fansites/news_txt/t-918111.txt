Boubouille2011-06-06, 02:39 PMPatch 4.2 - PTR Build 14241
A new build is being deployed on test realms.

Update - Murkablo - Preview #2 Now with Animations
Murkablo got a couple of animations in this patch, half of them are new and half of them are from the Deathwing mini-pet because, well, you know, it kinda makes sense for the Murloc/Diablo mini-pet to breath fire

Engineering

Engineering: Flintlocke's Woodchucker  is now restricted to hunters.


Mechanics - Mounted

Tarecgosa's Visage  has been added to the "mounted" spells, but not to the actual mounts. Most likely confirms the theory that the "Tarecgosa Mount" datamined is just a transformation during the questline and not an actual mount.

Unleash Flame , Unleash Frost , and Unleash Wind  no longer have a cooldowns but Unleash Elements  still has one. I'm going to assume it's just a fix to prevent bugs.
