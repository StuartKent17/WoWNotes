Boubouille2011-06-06, 02:39 PMPatch 4.2 - PTR Build 14241
A new build is being deployed on test realms.

Update - Murkablo - Preview #2 Now with Animations
Murkablo got a couple of animations in this patch, half of them are new and half of them are from the Deathwing mini-pet because, well, you know, it kinda makes sense for the Murloc/Diablo mini-pet to breath fire

Spell Changes

Cooking

Cooking: Kibler's Bits http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/43772/kiblers-bits/#14199/14241 now makes your pet bigger for 5 minutes. 


Engineering

Engineering: Flintlocke's Woodchucker http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/100587/flintlockes-woodchucker/#14199/14241 is now restricted to hunters.


Mechanics - Mounted

Tarecgosa's Visage http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/101641/tarecgosas-visage/#14199/14241 has been added to the "mounted" spells, but not to the actual mounts. Most likely confirms the theory that the "Tarecgosa Mount" datamined is just a transformation during the questline and not an actual mount.
