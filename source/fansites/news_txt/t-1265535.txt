Patch 5.2 - Troves of the Thunder King
Patch 5.2 makes use of solo scenarios for several storytelling purposes, but one of the scenarios http://ptr.wowdb.com/zones/6716-troves-of-the-thunder-king is purely to give you loot! To enter the scenario, you need to acquire a Key to the Palace of Lei Shen http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94222-key-to-the-palace-of-lei-shen. This key drops very rarely from mobs on the Isle of Thunder, more often from rare spawns on the Isle of Thunder, and in the rare spawn chests that appear on the isle.

Once inside, you can purchase various items http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=16408&filter-ilvl-min=90&filter-ilvl-max=90&filter-quality=2&filter-source=16384 for one to three Elder Charms to make the scenario easier. These allow you to do things like sleep a target for 25 seconds http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/97154-sleep-dust, walk on water and over tile traps http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/97157-potion-of-light-steps, open a single locked gate http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/97155-polymorphic-key, distract http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/97158-a-common-rock or trap a mob http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/97156-frost-rune-trap, and a quick forward jump http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/97159-arcane-propellant. Most of these items require a reputation level higher than friendly, so you will want to earn reputation with the new daily quest factions to take advantage of these items. 

When you are ready you can speak to Taoshi http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/70320-taoshi to begin. Once the doors open, you have five minutes to loot as many chests as you can. The only thing standing in your way are hostile NPCs, doors locked by levers, and lots of traps. There are columns of lightning that slow you down and cause damage, spiders that web you to the ground, tile traps on the floor that will stun, throw, or damage you, statues that will stun and damage you, or sentries that will damage you. 

The hostile NPCs consist of patrolling trolls, lions that wake up when you enter combat near them, and a final boss http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/70400-god-hulk-gulkan#related:criteria-of. The final boss is carrying one of the Golden Treasure Chests http://ptr.wowdb.com/objects/218772-golden-treasure-chest and guarding three others. 

While looting the chests, you will come across the smaller Mogu Treasure Chests http://ptr.wowdb.com/objects/218757-mogu-treasure-chest that contain 5-10 gold, Mote of Harmony http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/89112-mote-of-harmony, Spirit of Harmony http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/76061-spirit-of-harmony, Shan'ze Ritual Stones http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94221-shanze-ritual-stone, Elder Charm of Good Fortune http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/697-elder-charm-of-good-fortune, a Tattered Historical Parchments http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/95491-tattered-historical-parchments, and Burial Trove Keys http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/95497-burial-trove-key. 

The chest you are really interested in are the Golden Treasure Chests http://ptr.wowdb.com/objects/218772-golden-treasure-chest, as they contain greater amounts of the items from the other chest, as well as higher drop rates and more gold.

After the five minutes has elapsed, Taoshi pulls you out to a safe room with several of Lei Shen's Burial Troves http://ptr.wowdb.com/objects/218949-lei-shens-burial-trove, which require the Burial Trove Key http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/95497-burial-trove-key to open. Inside these chests you will find the same loot as the previous chests, but even more of it, along with 10 Justice Points and roughly 60 gold.

One well executed run can earn several hundred gold, 10+ Elder Charms, some Shan'ze Ritual Stones http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94221-shanze-ritual-stone, 20-30+ Tattered Historical Parchments http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/95491-tattered-historical-parchments, and many Motes and Spirit of Harmony. It is unlikey you will earn this much on your first few runs, as it takes time to learn where all of the chests are.

Throne of Thunder has received some significant improvements since we last previewed it Indoor http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azPDC7Gbnws / Outdoor http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLW6u1H_f9A. One of the bigger changes is the improvement made to Ra-den's room.

Normal Difficulty Learning Curve
How are we expected to gear up to iLevel 500 for 5.2 when the 5.0 Raids are tuned so horribly? There is no learning curve at all for the first 8 Bosses. They can all be beaten on the first few pulls with the exception of Elegon who might take an hour or two. Then comes Garalon who is so tightly tuned it feels like pre-nerf Spine HC. 
Patch 5.2 will reduce the damage and health of bosses on Patch 5.0 raids by 10%. And The 5.0 Raid Finders will have their droprate upped as well. Pair that with Patch 5.2's upcoming Raid Finder which requires item level 480 and hopefully you'll have more than enough gear in a timely manner to finish whichever bosses you have still left in 5.0 and move on to the Throne of Thunder.

Unfortunately Draztal the game doesn't work like that as much as Blizzard would like it too. When 5.2 comes out, even those players that didn't get around to completing T14 raids will enter ToT and forget all about T14 raids. Granted there is not "catch up" system this time like other tiers which is good and bad  good from a new player PoV, bad from an alt PoV. I hope this doesn't lead to normal modes gettign hit hard with nerf bats like firelands was
If they have enough gear to push through ToT certainly they have it to clear the remainder bosses of 5.0 raids once 5.2 has been released. Of course, it's up to each individual guild to do whatever they consider better. If they don't feel like finishing MV/HoF/TES... more power to them? Those that clear it before current content on normal will get a Feat of Strength called "Ahead of the Curve" for each of the end bosses in these three raids, too.

Of all professions, which one could need the most work to be better in the next expansion?
I'd say Leatherworking, but would be interested in other opinions. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/292390814754160641

When you make acc wid proffessions i close my account sorry this idea is Bullshit .
Why? Do you think it's a badge of honor for folks who have done it? Or do you just like the diversity? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294105533663825920

PTR Changes to Blacksmith leveling are inspired. Can we see Tailoring & Leatherworking getting the same treatment?
If the Blacksmithing and Engingeering ones are popular, we'll keep expanding it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/298906029033418752

Future
How many more major content patches should we expect out of MoP?
How many would you like ideally? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294620737946386432

Please don't let space issues get pushed past 5.2. Add a 2nd expensive void storage page. Should be trivial to implement.
Void Storage wasn't designed to let players keep every piece of gear ever or we wouldn't have capped it at all. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/296428985779376128

Any plans w/LFR loot to allow passing on loot you already have? Or allowing players to choose the type of loot they get?
Letting players choose to e.g. raid as Ret but choose Holy gear is something we plan on doing though unlikely to make 5.2. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/296428417484742656
We don't like passing in LFR. The entire point of the new system is to remove the social element of loot among strangers. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/296428265835474944

hey, remember the Battle for Undercity quest chain, and how it was removed. It would make a great scenario!
We agree. If only we had scenario tech back then. A good wish list feature for someday. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/296422817472319489

Warlock class mount fire should be green too! I like green. I just love it. I like every kind of green...
Class mount change requires different artists than the spells, but we can try and get it for 5.3. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/300000377867210753

what are the chances of a tabard list like pets and mounts? like to keep my 25 or so keepers but need that bank space.

UI / Addons
Have you guys ever though on getting rid of all 3rd party add-ons in WoW? I think it would add & fix a lot of problems @Ghostcrawler
Not really. It's a ton of work to support them, but many if not most players use some. The customization is cool and valuable. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293082013886476289

Do you think that the AH needs an overhaul? From a gold maker's point of view this default AH UI is entirely insufficient.
We understand that folks who play lots of AH want additional functionality. Seems like a fine roll for add-ons though, no? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/296436343972708356

Ever considered adding a UI element for players to track important buffs/cooldowns? Just icons/bars, with minor customization.
We've considered it. Players are very specific about what / how they want info displayed though, so it's tough to design. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/298896525411631104

Misc
and your solution was adding a bunch of crap to the game pet battles, LFR, transmog, challenge... when we just wanted raids
I think it's a dangerous use of "we" to assume a lot of players prefer raiding to pet battles or transmog. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/296431573295845376

Not true. Having nothing to do in Cata started in 4.1 with months of only two dungeons. Very few complaints in 4.0

It would seem though loud and angry mobs motivate more change then civil and intelligent posts. Sadly, that is how it appears.
It's not true. I think anger is what you insert in an argument when you don't have anything else. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/296640973600088064

No. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/297796847915917312
