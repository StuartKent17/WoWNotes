Taeshalach And Scythe of the Unmaker<br>
If your class can equip the respective weapon, you&apos;ll have a chance of earning it from Agrammar and Argus respectively. It doesn&apos;t matter what your loot specialization or active class specialization is at the time.<br>

arena ladders are only updating every 3-4 hours.....they use to update instantly...any plans for a fix?<br>
This was a deliberate change to stop abuse that could come from monitoring real-time queue activity. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/932787600124911617))<br>

This Week in WoW History<br>
We&apos;re taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br>
<br>
Cataclysm Live<br>
The third expansion of WoW hit the live servers in 2010, bringing new raids, dungeons, zones, professions, and races to the game. The new raids were Blackwing Descent, Bastion of Twilight, Throne of the Four Winds, along with Baradin Hold, which was the raid which had a chance at rewarding players with some PvP loot as well. This expansion brought five leveling zones, and two introductory zones for the new races. PvP lovers got to enjoy Tol Barad, the new outdoor PvP zone, along with two new battlegrounds, Twin Peaks, and Battle for Gilneas.<br>

<br>
Heroic Dragon Soul<br>
The race is on! With the opening of Heroic Dragon Soul, guilds set off to kill Deathwing and claim the World 1st title. However, the introduction of LFR brought an unforeseen exploitable bug which some guilds took advantage of. A few of the top guilds, most notably Paragon, were banned for exploiting this buff preventing them from progressing Heroic until their suspension was over.<br>

<br>
Cinder Kitten<br>
In 2012 the newest addition to the Pet Store was the Cinder Kitten. As always, during the holiday season Blizzard donated 100% of the adoption fee to the American Red to help with the Hurricane Sandy relief efforts. This battle pet has Rare quality stats and is part of the Elemental family. <br>

<br>
Black Market Auction House Items<br>
Patch 5.1 brought a few new items to the BMAH, with the addition of the Sun-Lute of the Phoenix King, which turned the wearer into Sig Nicious on use. For players who missed out on their Ulduar and Naxxramas Glory achievements, the Reins of the Plagued Proto-Drake and Reins of the Rusted-Proto Drake were added as well.<br>

Warcraft Movie Cast<br>
Legendary sent out two tweets in 2013, revealing the cast and production date of the new Warcraft movie. Roles were not announced quite yet, but Ben Foster, Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Toby Kebbell, and Rob Kazinsky would star in the new movie. Production was scheduled to begin in Vancouver, during January 2014.<br>

<br>
Alliance Chopper<br>
Warlords of Draenor brought the newest gold-sink mount, with the addition of the Alliance Chopper. This mount is purchasable in Stormwind for 100,000 gold. The community had mixed reactions to this addition, especially because of its very high price, compared to other mounts. <br>

<br>
American Red Cross Bundle<br>
In 2014, Argi the Inter-goat-lactic pet and the Grinning Reaver mounts were added to the Blizzard Store. All proceeds from pet purchases directly benefited the American Red Cross to help with Ebola relief efforts in Africa. The pet and mount was also sold in a bundle, with discounted price, with the full price of the pet still going to charity. <br>

<br>
Micro Holidays<br>
Call of the Scarab and Kirin Tor Tavern Crawl were discovered on the PTR, along with the announcement of many other Micro-Holidays. These new events only lasted a short time, and celebrate small things we love in the game. Currently there are eight micro-holidays in the game, such as the Hatching of the Hippogryphs, Un&#x2019;goro Madness, Volunteer Guard Day, and the Thousand Boat Bash.<br>

Ronda Rousey and Vin Diesel are WoW Friends<br>
During her appearance on The Tonight Show, Ronda talked a little about her adventures in WoW. While working on the production of Fast 7, she became friends with Vin Diesel and they played WoW together as a Druid and a Hunter.<br>
