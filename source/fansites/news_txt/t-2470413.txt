The Seafarer's Dubloon vendors https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8099-Seafarer-s-Doubloon-Vendors-Diablo-3-BlizzCon-Reward-MDI-All-Stars-at-BlizzCon?page= now sell several bind on account gear tokens for 20 x Seafarer's Dubloons https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1710-seafarers-dubloon each. These can be used or mailed to alts that are Level 111+. 

These work much like the gear tokens from Tanaan Jungle and Argus, providing a piece of gear appropriate for the level of the character that utilizes it. The item level starts at 214 for level 111's and increases up to 282 for a level 120. The tokens can proc higher item levels, much like previous iterations.
