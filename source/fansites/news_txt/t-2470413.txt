Patch 8.1.5 PTR - Island Expedition BoA Gear Tokens
The Seafarer's Dubloon vendors  now sell several bind on account gear tokens for 20 x Seafarer's Dubloons  each. These can be used or mailed to alts that are Level 111+. 

These work much like the gear tokens from Tanaan Jungle and Argus, providing a piece of gear appropriate for the level of the character that utilizes it. The item level starts at 214 for level 111's and increases up to 282 for a level 120. The tokens can proc higher item levels, much like previous iterations.
