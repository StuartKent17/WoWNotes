WotLK scheduled to be released in second half of 2008
Vivendi's released a press release  with their earnings for the first quarter of 2008. Even if that's probably not interesting for the average WoW player, there is a very, very instructive comment related to WoW. 


 

According to this press release, Wrath of the Lich King will be released before the end of 2008. You've probably been reading it for the last few days, but if you didn't check it yet you can read the WotLK preview released during the weekend.

Archimonde & Eredar Twins Hotfix
We just implemented a hotfix for all realms that makes Archimonde's doomfires no longer be able to move right through him after they spawn. Their movement should now be much more consistent with the previous patch's behavior, and melee should have a bit easier time dodging the doomfires as a result of the change. There have been other reports of odd behavior in the encounter since the 2.4.2 patch, but this is the only problem we've been able to verify locally. We'll continue to monitor reports of unusual behavior in this encounter, and investigate further as needed.

We also hotfixed a bug in the Eredar Twins encounter that prevent a Hunter's Feign Death ability from working if Lady Sacrolash was alive.


2 New M'uru Drops
2 new items have been added to the M'uru loot table, the Vicious Hawkstrider Hauberk  Mail and the Fel Conqueror's Raiments  Cloth.

Polar bear mount confirmed in WotLK
Some accomplishments will have a limited time in where you can get them, yes, but generally speaking there are quite few of them in the game. For players who are focused on romping around on a bear, there will be another one in Wrath of the Lich King. Source 
As Tigole put it, does a polar bear sound cool? Source 

There is no plan to tune outdoor bosses for 25 players instead of 40
If only 25 people were needed to take down Kazzak, then you could just fill the last 15 spots with nothing but DPS players and likely simplify the encounter. So the next step would be limiting raid sizes to 25 players instead of 40, but this would likely have a negative impact on things like Alterac Valley, city raids for those that do them, and rotating players in raids I know guilds that use the extra slots to track names. I understand that it's rough to suddenly need 40 people instead of 25 for an encounter, so if your guild is doing it, hopefully the loot rules can be explained clearly to all extra people - if you are going to another guild's, hopefully they explain them to you so you know what you are getting into. Source 

Is there any plan to give Seal of Blood to the Alliance ?
There are currently no plans for any changes in this regard, but we will of course let you know if it is ever decided to make any such changes. Source
