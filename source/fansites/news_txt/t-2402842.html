Hey all,<br>
<br>
Since the first round of changes to Retribution early on in alpha, we&apos;ve been letting the spec settle into a steady-state, but have been very much keeping it in mind. Like many have suggested, the spec is almost all the way there, but is missing a little bit baseline.<br>
<br>
Blade of Wrath <br>
Blade of Wrath&apos;s mechanic is becoming baseline, named Art of War: Your auto attacks have a chance to reset the cooldown of Blade of Justice. Any many correctly pointed out, this is a sort of unpredictability that the spec needed in its baseline rotation.<br>
<br>
Blade of Wrath, the talent, will now increase the frequency of Art of War resets and cause its proc to also increase the damage of the next Blade of Justice by 25%. Numbers are pending tuning, but the gameplay is there.<br>
<br>
Divine Purpose<br>
Divine Purpose&apos;s proc chance has been reduced to 15% (down from 20%), but it now also increases the damage and healing of that free Holy Power spender by 20%.<br>
<br>
The entire value of this talent was in the free Holy Power proc, which is a huge swing on button presses and pacing, but which neither of its talent match-ups provide. This change reduces that difference slightly and gives Divine Purpose a little more nuance to its gameplay &#x2013; now you may consider saving or waiting for that proc to use on a different Holy Power spender from usual.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the patience and continued feedback.</div></div>
