Boubouille2009-04-26, 01:00 AMNoblegarden Comes to Azeroth
The Noblegarden is now live on european servers and will be available in the US in a few hours. Before you read the "guide" you have to keep in mind that this event is very simple. 

1. Brightly Colored Eggs are hidden in the starting town of each races: Bloodhoof Village, Brill, Falcowing Square, and Razor Hill for the Horde. Azure Watch, Goldshire, Dolanaar, and Kharanos for the Alliance. The eggs are only in this town and will respawn in a few seconds/minutes, it probably won't be enough during the first days of the event because a LOT of players will be camping them. They're hidden in different spots of the town and might be a little hard to find at first, but it becomes very easy when you know what you're looking for. 


     

2. Looting the eggs will give you a 
 Chocolate  or one of the rare item from the event, you can also buy all of them with the chocolates if you're lucky enough with your eggs. Please note that 
Dressed for the Occasion  and Sunday's Finest  will not work if you buy the items from the NPC, you have to find the items in an egg to complete the achievement. These 2 achievements are NOT part of the Noble Gardener  meta-achievement.

3. When you've got enough chocolate to buy all the items you need for the achievements, the only thing left to do is to complete the achievements that require you to travel in other zones/continents : 
Desert Rose , 
Spring Fling  / Spring Fling  and 
Noble Garden  / Noble Garden  

The Noblegarden Vendors  will let you buy the items you want if you can't find them in eggs.
