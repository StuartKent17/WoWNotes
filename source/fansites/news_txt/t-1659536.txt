Winter Veil 2014
The Feast of Winter Veil  is here and brings new gifts this year! When you unwrap your present this year, you will find a Crashin' Thrashin' Shredder Controller  inside. If you missed last year's gift, the Crashin' Thrashin' Flyer Controller , you can find it in Stolen Present  from the daily quest.

This year once again adds an updated version of the Miniature Winter Veil Tree  The Stolen Present  can also contain the new Scroll of Storytelling , which gives your camera an old time sepia effect. 


  


Garrison Addon - Bulkie
Today we are taking a look at a simple addon that saves you from repeated clicking. Bulkie  will queue up the maximum number of work orders with just one click! If you want to press one less button, take a look at BulkOrder , which will start adding work orders as soon as you talk to the NPC.


  


Patch 6.0.3 Hotfixes - December 16
Garrisons, Followers, and Outposts

Garrison Buildings

A hotfix in testing from December 11 for the Inn has been implemented. The achievement, Stay Awhile and Listen now only requires the character to complete 10 of the 20 Inn quests down from all 20.


Creatures and NPCs

Shadowmoon Valley

Yggdrel now deals less damage with the Entangling Vine ability.


Dungeons, Raids, and Scenarios

[Hotfix currently in-testing] Messages for obtaining an Augment Rune are no longer broadcasting to the party or raid group.
Raids

Highmaul

Tectus' health has been reduced by about 15% when the raid is scaled to 10 players on Raid Finder, Normal, and Heroic difficulties. As the raid scales up to a maximum of 30 players, Tectus' health for 30 players remains roughly unchanged from before this hotfix.


Professions

Enchanting

[Hotfix currently in-testing] Mark of Blackrock can no longer trigger its effect for the first 40 seconds after equipping the weapon.


UI

Resolved an issue where having a player join the Dungeon Finder or Raid Finder group just as another player was leaving could cause the button to queue up for additional players to remain greyed out for the rest of the group.
Resolved an issue where the Darkmoon Faire was not showing up in the in-game calendar past December 2014.



Garrison Outpost Hotfixes
These changes  went live with today’s restarts. In addition, players who had already switched their outpost buildings prior to today should now be able to access the quests and follower associated with the new building.

Just a quick update: we're working on a fix for the issues with buildings reverting as well as being unable to actually pick up the follower. I don't have a solid ETA just yet on when that will apply.


Blue Tweets
PvP
glad sanctum conquest goes towards the Ashran bonus, right? I put in a ticket and got a super canned answer 
it does not holinka 

~100% of Top 100 in 3v3 arena EU and US = Alliance. "Ah well, it is time for the alliance to shine." - Holinka 2014
I never said that holinka 

A lot of ppl are wondering how many times a week you can get an epic drop from a daily Ashran win?
Once per week holinka 

Neither faction nor class representation is anywhere close to balanced.. Sad to see the game in such state.
Many players are overly fixated on representation but probably because it is the only metric to look at. holinka
