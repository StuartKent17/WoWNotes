Yes, the expansion is World of Warcraft : Wrath of the Lich King. You can stop posting fakes. See you on August 3rd. 

Of course this information isn't backed up by any official source, etc, etc, etc. And I personally don't have informations about the Deathknight, I can only confirm the expansion name. 

Update : See this post for confirmation.
