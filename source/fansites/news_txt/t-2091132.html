Frost<br>
<br>
Ice Form (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198144) now has a 60 second cooldown (was 45 seconds).<br>
Ice Form (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198144) can no longer be cast while stunned.<br>
Ice Form (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198144) will now cause the Mage to be immune to only stuns, instead of other unintended crowd-control effects, such as Paralysis.<br>
Frostbolt no longer deals increased damage in PvP (was a multiplier of +10%).<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; Notes: Frost Mages are intended to create burst windows with Shatter and Glacial Spike, but have been reaching unintended levels of damage. By reducing Frostbolt damage, we&#x2019;re reducing the potential size of Icicles and Glacial Spike burst. The Ice Form fixes should reduce its uptime, which was too high.<br>

Beast Mastery<br>
<br>
Beast Mastery Agility reduced by 10% in PvP.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; Notes: We&#x2019;ve found Beast Mastery damage to be too high, but we don&#x2019;t feel that it&#x2019;s due to any specific ability or mechanic, so we&#x2019;re reducing the overall PvP template.<br>
<br>

Mistweaver<br>
<br>
Mistwalk can no longer be cast while silenced.<br>
<br>
<br>
Soothing Mist healing reduced by 10% in PvP. (Soothing Mist version of Ancient Mistweaver Arts is unaffected.)<br>
Soothing Mist healing cast by Summon Jade Serpent Statue reduced by 10% in PvP.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; Notes: Mistweavers been one of our strongest healers. We feel Soothing Mist is doing too much healing per second on its own, making it so that the Mistweaver doesn&#x2019;t have to use cast-time healing spells as much as other healers, even when their target is taking high amounts of damage. We&#x2019;re reducing Soothing Mist slightly to address this. Mistwalk was never intended to be used while the Mistweaver was silenced or locked out of Nature, so we&#x2019;ve fixed that as a bug.<br>

<br>
Pure of Heart (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199424) no longer causes Cleanse to incur a cooldown when it removes poisons and diseases.<br>
Pure of Heart (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199424) no longer triggers when healed by a periodic heal effect, but will trigger when a spell such as Rejuvenation is initially cast.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; Notes: Retribution Paladins are designed to be a formidable damage dealer and also have a protective, counter-control kit for their allies. Pure of Heart is intended to &#x201C;soft-counter&#x201D; poisons and diseases, but we feel it&#x2019;s too strong currently when the Paladin is paired with a healing-over-time healer. Pure of Heart will now only trigger when a healing spell is applied, but not periodically during the spell.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Retribution<br>
<br>
Blessing of Sanctuary (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/210256) now has a 30 second cooldown, up from 25 seconds.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; Notes: Blessing of Sanctuary has proven to be a strong, signature Honor Talent, but we feel its cooldown is too short.<br>
<br>

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/rogue) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Q) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#RAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#Q))<br>
Assassination<br>
<br>
System Shock (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198145) now properly requires an Envenom cast with 5 or more combo points.<br>
System Shock (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198145)&#x2019;s damage has been reduced by 20%.<br>
Assassination&#x2019;s Agility has been reduced by 5% in PvP.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; Notes: The Assassination Rogue is intended to be a strong, persistent damage dealer that pressures targets but lacks the utility that Outlaw excels in or the mobility that Subtlety provides. We&#x2019;ve been monitoring their damage and feel its higher than intended, and we&#x2019;ve found some bugs with System Shock contributed to this. We&#x2019;ve also altered their PvP template to effectively reduce their damage. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Outlaw<br>
<br>
Control is King (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/212217) will no longer stack Adrenaline Rush above a 3 second duration.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; Notes: Control is King is intended to be an attractive choice for the Outlaw Rogue when within a control oriented team composition. This has worked out a bit too well. Now, subsequent procs of Control of King will no longer add to the duration, and instead will just refresh itself.<br>

Enhancement<br>
<br>
Stormstrike (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/32175)&#x2019;s damage is reduced by 15% in PvP.<br>
Heroism (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/32182) and Bloodlust now have a 60 second cooldown when modified by Shamanism (was 45 seconds).<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; Notes: The Enhancement Shaman is intended to be a formidable damage dealer who also provides offensive group utility through totems and buffs. Shamanism has been a popular choice for the Enhancement Shaman, allowing them to use Bloodlust/Heroism frequently and also in Arena combat. We like the utility this gives the Shaman, but feel its uptime is too high. Further, we feel the Enhancement Shaman&#x2019;s burst damage with Stormstrike has been reaching unintended levels.</div></div>
