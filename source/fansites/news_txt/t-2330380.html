A quick outline of what to expect in the future of Overwatch!<br>
<br>
New Hero: Development of Moira<br>
<br>
Moira is the new Support Healer<br>
The geneticist of the team<br>
Moira doesn&apos;t allow morals to come in the way of science<br>
Recruited by Reyes to join Blackwatch<br>
Allied herself with Talon, after Overwatch was gone<br>
<br>
<br>
The Art of Moira<br>
<br>
Concept art weapons included syringes, and a two handed cannon, and tentacles<br>
Her duality between doing damage and healing indicated by the liquid in the tubes<br>
Drains energy from her enemies<br>
Ultimate Ability: Coalescence, which is a frontal beam<br>
<br>
<br>
Skins<br>
<br>
Oasis: She was invited to be the minister of Genetics in Oasis<br>
Glam: A tribute to Glam Rock in from the 70s<br>
<br>
<br>
Gameplay<br>
<br>
Biotic Grasp: Primary fire is Regeneration, which is a healing throughput. Controlled by a meter<br>
Secondary fire is Decay, which does damage and fills the meter back up. Small amount of Leech<br>
Fade (Shift): A small dash, making her invisible, which also grants movement speed<br>
Biotic Orb (E): Pulls out two orbs, then the healing one can be activated by Primary fire, or damage orb by Secondary fire<br>
This orb does AOE healing, bounces around, slows down when it is close to a friendly target<br>
Coalescence (Q): Long range frontal beam that heals allies and damages enemies affected by it<br>
This ultimate pierces barriers<br>
<br>
<br>
New Map: Blizzard World<br>
<br>
The idea has been around since before last BlizzCon<br>
BlizzardWorld is an amusement park, celebrating the worlds and places of Blizzard Ent.<br>
There is no Overwatch part of the Park<br>
Hybrid Map<br>
First is a Control Point<br>
Two main paths to the first point<br>
The first choke is a mini-arena, with multiple routes<br>
Several Healthpacks to gain a foothold<br>
After capturing the first point, it is time to move the payload<br>
Circular arena, with abundance of high-ground<br>
Multiple flanking routes, Mega healthpacks and corridors<br>
Push the payload to the Throne of the Skeleton King, in Leoric&apos;s Manor<br>
Hidden lore in the area<br>
The park was designed by artists from all Blizzard Games<br>
Lots of easter eggs, including special voicelines<br>
Coming to the PTR soon, and will go live early next year<br>
<br>
<br>
