Boubouille2011-02-02, 08:45 AMThings aren't getting better and community managers literally disappeared from the surface of the Earth. The good news is that at this rate, I'll probably be desperate enough to post pictures of naked gnomes by the end of the week don't worry, as far as I know everyone will be back to work today. 

Halfus Wyrmbreaker spawn cycle
Ever since the release of Cataclysm, people have been posting on the Raids & Dungeons forums each week to ask what the spawns are for Halfus Wyrmbreaker. Our lovely and awesome Simca  eventually started Theory: Halfus is not random  to see if we can predict the encounters for the upcoming weeks. 

The answer is yes, the add rotation is fully known and verified and unless Blizzard hotfixes something, you should now be able to plan your raids accordingly. The naming scheme is the one from the original post, that's why the week # aren't in the right order
