Check the PTR - Mimiron Testing (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=43968.0) thread for more info on this boss! <br>
<br>
Also, some of the trinkets posted a few days ago have been updated with their Ulduar stats! Flare of the Heavens (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/flareoftheheavensv2.jpg) (Spell DPS), Living Flame (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/livingflamev2.jpg) (Spell DPS), Heart of Iron (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/heartofironv2.jpg) (Tanking), The General&apos;s Heart (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/thegeneralsheartv2.jpg) (Tanking), Wrathstone (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/wrathstonev2.jpg). <br>
<br>
One last thing, the background downloader is now downloading the first part of Patch 3.1. This isn&apos;t very surprising, according to this official post (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/15660807859-long-strange-trip-noblegarden-and-31.html), the current goal is to have the patch released at the beginning of April, however nothing is sure and devs are already thinking about the possibility to postpone the Noblegarden event if they can&apos;t make it on time. <br>
