Items

Twin-Pipe Buster Cannon https://www.wowdb.com/items/165600-twin-pipe-buster-cannon bonus effect damage has been increased by 83%.

Developers’ notes: While iterating on itemization feedback, we discovered that the Buster Cannon’s effect had been tuned low. This should make it more competitive with other ranged weapons at similar item levels. Should you wish to restore a deleted Twin-Pipe Buster Cannon, please use our Item Restoration website: https://battle.net/support/restoration
