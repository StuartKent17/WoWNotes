Armory Stats - Legendary Quest Line Achievements
Today we are taking a look at the legendary quest achievement completion rate of players. The data used today is a sample of 6.1 million characters from 3.1 million accounts. We also did this at the end of 2013 for Mists of Pandaria, which you can see here http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3644-Armory-Stats-Legendary-Quest-Achievements-Blue-Tweets-IV-Contest-Voting.

Archaeology Tab Progress Fix
It looks like the Archaeology fix isn't done just yet. 
Thank you for your reports so far guys, they have all been forwarded on for further investigation. We'll post back here once we have updates to share. In the meantime, please remember to submit the following information if your Archaeology progress has NOT been fixed:


Character name and realm
Did you recently perform a character service on the affected character? If so, what was the character service and when was it performed?
What progress are you missing?
What skill level did you lose?


Thanks!

Class Changes
Hotfixes continue to make minor to moderate class changes where appropriate. Depending on what you're referring to it could be a change we'd need to make in a patch, and patch schedules are set pretty far in advance. We're not quite ready yet to begin discussing changes for 6.2, but certainly you can follow along for the hotfixes that are being made, look forward to future patch announcements, and share your feedback here in the appropriate forum.

.Why does the Windwalker movespeed aura not stack with the passive portion of Pursuit of Justice?
It's by design. From the Pursuit of Justice tooltip: “This does not stack with most other movement speed increasing effects.” WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578337646260330497

the rogue talent Shuriken Toss' auto-attacks only apply lethal poisens? Is this intended?
Yes, only lethal poisons. This was inadvertently left out of the tooltip. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578334625535115264

I still haven't seen any response about the Codex of Xerrath not applying to Glyph of Metamorphosis! On the radar?
We don’t currently have plans to support this particular combination of visual options. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578336170767060993

Character / Items
thx for all the heirloom upgrades/tab. Any plans to convert existing plate to str/int like wod add int plate for pallys?
We don’t currently have plans to do that. We like heirlooms being targeted to specific roles. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578334442877423616

PvE
is crit chance reduced versus raid bosses?
Crit chance is affected by the target’s level, yes. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578333770459185152

PvP
When does the 18sec window start? At the beginning of first cc, end of the 3rd cc? It'd be awesome, if that was specified.
It starts each time the crowd control effect is applied e.g. the moment the target becomes stunned. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578252494360326144

Misc
Any Chance on Seeing 6.1 Legendary Questline Cinematic on our Garisson like other important Cinematics during lvling ?
We're going to shoot for Patch 6.2 to get this added onto the list. Thanks for the suggestion! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578311461732114432

My bank is getting filled up with in-game books, any plans on implementing a library?
Hmmm, I could see turning all of them into toys at some point, that might be neat. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/578697708006821888
