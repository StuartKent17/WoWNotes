Patch 4.3: Deathwing Brings Raid to You!<br>
On the PTR, Deathwing lets you know he is ready to fight in Dragon Soul by visiting Orgrimmar and Stormwind and trying to burn them down! Keep in mind that this event took place early in testing and could turn out to be a PTR only event.<br>

MoP Intellect Change<br>
The way we see it, Intellect increases the power of your heals. Spirit (and other regeneration mechanics) replenishes your mana. Having Intellect also increase the size of your mana pool complicates things. It&apos;s harder to balance, and feels worse for players trying to balance their character.<br>
<br>
While we think the healer mana model for Cataclysm is sound and ultimately accomplished what we wanted, it was still a little too difficult for a on fresh level 85 just going into dungeons, and a little too easy for raiders. Part of that comes from what improved stats do for healers: they get bigger heals (from Intellect), the ability to cast more heals (larger mana pool), and the ability to cast those heals for a longer period of time without running out of mana (as a result of regen). Along the way, the tank and the group are take more damage from tougher bosses, but also have higher damage and higher survivability from improvements to their own gear.<br>
<br>
Please remember, the goal isn&#x2019;t to make healers so resource-starved that they can&#x2019;t heal. That isn&#x2019;t fun. The goal is to reward healers who limit how much overhealing they do (in other words, play smarter) for their efforts. You limit your overhealing by doing things like casting a smaller heal when a smaller heal is sufficient, or casting a slower heal when death isn&#x2019;t imminent, or casting a single-target heal when the group isn&#x2019;t all taking damage at once. Skillful healers should prosper. When players feel like increasing their skill doesn&#x2019;t increase their success, they tend to get bored or frustrated.

Stampede<br>
So, would it use our pets we have on hand or would it be more like the group of npc&apos;s we get when you do the Firelands daily at Sethria&apos;s Roost? Just some random animals. Would it use any of our pet&apos;s special abilities?<br>
<br>
We&apos;re talking about something that is completely hypothetical, so anything is possible. I personally would want the ability to call the five pets that I actually have on hand at the time, since that would give me control over what everyone sees when I send out the stampede.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, it makes a lot of sense for the spell effects to not vary much from hunter to hunter, so special abilities would be right out, *but* I wouldn&apos;t mind seeing the pets going through their best motions.

Glyph of Inquisition feedback<br>
The intent is that it is not damage neutral. Yes, managing Inquisition should mean higher DPS, if you are exceptional at managing it. However, a lot of players find that they can&#x2019;t operate their class at full effectiveness when they are actually in an encounter with all of the running around, target switching and other encounter mechanics that aren&#x2019;t present when blasting away at a target dummy. One of the biggest differences we see between good guilds and best-in-the-world guilds is that the latter can maintain maximum DPS in almost any situation.<br>
<br>
The hope by implementing a glyph like this (and we aren&#x2019;t sure we will, which is why we want feedback) is that your empirical DPS with the glyph may be higher than your theoretical DPS without it. Players who ignored the glyph might do lower DPS (because they are mortal and sometimes fumble with Inquisition) than if they just used the glyph.<br>
<br>
This is the kind of idea that, if it works, would be something we could do it for most classes and specs: trade off higher theoretical damage / tanking / healing for an easier rotation that might just mean higher effectiveness for some players.
