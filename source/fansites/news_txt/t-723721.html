Cataclysm Beta<br>
We&apos;ll make it very clear when the time comes that the beta has started and what to expect if you are selected. Currently, with the StarCraft II beta, players who were selected were sent an email and were asked to log into their Battle.net account to access the beta download. Cataclysm beta should work similarly. We&apos;ll do our best to be as clear in the process as we can so that everyone can hopefully avoid the more unscrupulous schemers who attempt to phish for accounts.<br>
<br>
Just to be clear now, we have not started any beta invites at this time. Please be cautious of any emails you may receive until we say otherwise. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25171671130/common-give-us-cata-news/))</div></div>
