Boubouille2008-02-22, 01:51 AMRaid testing has been disabled on PTR for a few days, it gives us some time to cover the most important points of the last two weeks. There was a few important announcements that I didn't report because of the tons of 2.4 information but I guess it's a good time to do it now. 

Season 4 Armor - Slight update

Don't get your hopes too high, there isn't any new item. I just re-did the screenshot on a human player because a few items look nicer on him and it prevents clipping on helms.

Shifting Tanzanite nerfed
A lot of melee DPS classes will be very sad about this, but the good old [item=30549] got nerfed from +5 Strength +4 Agility to +5 Agility and +6 Stamina. It's been added to the list of undocumented changes from the latest PTR Build 


 


Sunwell raid testing disabled on PTR until next build
It looks like Blizzard had enough raid testing, the Sunwell Plateau raid instance will be disabled until the next PTR Build.
I wanted to give everyone a head's up that we'll be disabling the Sunwell Raid zone on the PTR until we our next PTR patch which will be very soon!. We're applying a hotfix right now that will accomplish this.

The testing on the PTR has been excellent and we greatly appreciate all of the hard work you guys are doing. You're going to help us to make the zone great!

Kalecgos is close enough that we can finish off testing him internally at this point. Brutallus will get a minor change next patch stomp removes burn. We'll do brief testing on him next patch and then disable him. Felmyst and the Eredar Twins both get major changes next patch. The oh-so-compelling, non-boss mobs also get a good deal of tuning in the next patch.

Thanks again and we'll see the Sunwell Raiding folks in a day or two!


Midsummer Festival in 2.4
The Midsummer is getting a full revamp in 2.4 and it's already available for testing on PTRs.
The World Event Team has activated the revamped Midsummer Fire Festival on the PTR. The primary focus of the PTR testing is still on the content of the Isle of Quel'Danas, but if you could spare some testing time to review the holiday, we'd greatly appreciate it!

You can visit any capital city -- including Shattrath -- to begin most quests involving the holiday.

Some focus points for feedback:
The boss fight similar to the Headless Horseman located in the Slave Pens of Coilfang Reservoir;
The Torch Tossing and Torch Catching quests located in the capitals;
The lead-in quests offered by the Earthen Ring elders and the daily summon quests that result;
The various camps in the wilderness and the buffs that result from activities there honoring the flame, dancing around the ribbon pole with multiple people.



We'll also gladly take any other feedback you may have regarding the holiday.

Here are the known issues that have been fixed on our end and should be fixed soon on the PTR:
The Glacial Lieutenants from the Ice Stones in Silithus are not able to be attacked.
More Torch Tossing and More Torch Catching are unable to be completed for Horde players.
The Flame Keepers and Flame Wardens are hostile; this will be changed.



Drinking nerfed in PvP
First "old" post of the day, I never posted about it and it's one of the major PvP changes in 2.4 : Drinking in arenas has been nerfed ! It's briefly mentionned in the patch notes and you'd probably like some details. 
There is indeed a change in 2.4 intended to offset some of the mana regen from drinking away from the very beginning of the duration.

However, we specifically made sure the water would not change the amount of mana regenerated by players who drink between pulls or during gauntlet runs. You should see little to no difference in the amount of mana yielded if you sit to drink for at least 4 seconds, which most players do.

So right now you get a tick roughly every two seconds. After the change the first tick will give you nothing, second tick will give you normal tick+66% extra, the third tick normal+33% extra, and then it levels back off after that. So, at the ~6 second mark or after three ticks you've made as much as you would have before.

The change has to be consistent across all water as this fix applies to Arenas, battlegrounds, and world PvP, which will have specific emphasis in the upcoming expansion.

However, according to one of the latest blue posts, this rule will only apply in Arenas, but keep in mind that we're on test servers and everything is subject to change. 
You haven't read it wrong, but we've decided to have that rule only apply inside arenas. It's an inconsistency, but one we're ok with to prevent water from feeling unnecessarily weird everywhere else.


Global Arena Tournament
Last but not least, the global arena tournament announced last week with entry fees and 120,000$ in cash prizes. I know it's a week old but I'll assume you've only been reading this site for the past two weeks. ^^
IRVINE, Calif. - February 14, 2008 - Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. today announced plans to launch a new type of tournament competition using the Arena system in World of Warcraft®, its popular subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game. The tournaments will take place on special realms that allow competitors to instantly create level-70 characters with epic equipment, placing the focus on tactics and execution rather than normal adventuring.

The tournaments are scheduled to start in April with two rounds of online qualifiers in Europe, South Korea, North America, and the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. Each qualifier round will have a per-competitor entry fee -- €15/£12 in Europe; 20,000 won in South Korea; $20 in North America; and NT$450 in the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau -- and will run for six weeks. During this time, teams will play 3-vs.-3 matches on the tournament realm in their region, with the top four teams from each round advancing to the regional finals to compete for more than $27,000 in cash prizes. Winners from each regional will then be invited to a global championship event to compete for $120,000 in cash prizes, including a $75,000 grand prize.

There is also a FAQ on the official site, here are the most interesting questions : 
[b] Can I have more than three people on my team roster?
Yes. You can have up to six players on your 3v3 Arena team for the online qualifiers. The additional players will act as "bench" players in case one of your starting three cannot play, or if you want to change the makeup of your team. If your team advances to the live events, however, you will have to choose three players to represent your team. These players can choose which characters they wish to play at the live event and may switch characters as needed.

How many games do I have to play to be eligible to qualify?
Each team must play a minimum of 200 games per qualifier. Each player, including "bench players," must participate in at least 30% of the team's total games to be eligible to advance to the regional finals. If a team were to play the minimum of 200 games, then each player on the team would have to have played in at least 60 of those games.

How do the qualifiers work?
There will be two online qualifiers that will run for six weeks each. The top four teams from each qualifier will advance to the regional finals. Each team will only be eligible to qualify for the regional finals once. If a team has already qualified during the first qualifier and places in the top four of the second qualifier, the next-highest-ranked eligible team will advance. The first two weeks of each qualifier will be used for practice. After the practice period, ratings will be reset and the tournament will continue for four weeks. To encourage team stability, there will be a 150 team rating penalty for any player additions to your team during the first two weeks after the practice period. Player rosters will be locked down during the final two weeks of the tournament, and no changes may be made to your team during that time. Please make any adjustments to your final team roster prior to the roster lockdown.

How will the live events work?
The top four teams from each qualifier will make up the eight teams that will compete at a live regional event time and date to be announced in the near future. The top teams from each regional final will be invited to represent their respective region at the global world championship.

What are the prizes?
The grand prize for the global invitational world championship will be $75,000 for the top team. The top team of each regional final will receive $15,000. For more information, check the complete breakdown of prizes

Why is there an entry fee to join the 2008 World of Warcraft Arena Tournament?
There are several reasons for the entry fee, one of which being that, as with most professional tournaments, the fee helps ensure that participants are invested in the competition and remain dedicated to it for the duration of the tournament. In addition, the stakes are higher for this tournament than for standard Arena play, with a total prize pool of more than $200,000 in cash prizes up for grabs. Furthermore, this new format should help provide professional-level players with a highly competitive, even playing field on the tournament realms.
