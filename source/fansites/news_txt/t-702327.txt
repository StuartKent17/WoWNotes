A few minutes ago, Modk , a Death Knight Juggernaut  US-Mal'ganis was the first player to complete the questline to rebuild the legendary Shadowmourne  Congratulations to one lucky DK, and a very supportive guild!


 

According to Modk, the axe behaves exactly like in the video I posted a while back, except that the proc was slightly changed in a later version of the game, see Item - Shadowmourne Legendary
