Dev Interviews
BlizzPlanet http://warcraft.blizzplanet.com/blog/comments/gamescom-2015-legion-interview-with-tom-chilton-ion-hazzikostas had the chance to talk to the developers about Legion. New information that wasn't in other interviews is below:


There won't be another filler patch between Warlords and the Legion invasion, other than the flying patch.
Ruby Sanctum didn't work out well. It was entertaining for a week or so, as there was one boss to kill and then you were done. 
In Warlords, the team didn't do enough to express the story through in-game content. The garrison campaign wasn't enough. 
One more character slot is being added.
Having one artifact per spec will help to focus the specs. Right now Frost Death Knights can use a two-hand weapon or dual wield, but their artifact is two runeblades, so they will focus on dual-wielding in Legion and Unholy will focus on two-hand weapons.
The new Honor system allows for some new abilities to be added that would have been cut in the past, as they were PvP only.
Draenor's forces are busy rebuilding Draenor, so they are not going to come and help with the Burning Legion.
Illidan's storyline will span the entire expansion.
Only allowing elves to be Demon Hunters fits the lore and is the right choice for Legion.
One of the social features under development is notifying you when friends join a queue and allowing you to queue with them.
The team would also like to improve communication across groups. If you have a group of friends you raid with or PvP with there should be a better way to communicate with them.
Older time limited legendary items, such as the Mists of Pandaria cape, may become transmogable.
The sewers of Dalaran were mention as an Order Hall for Rogues again.
Champions will unlock or complement content rather than doing content for you.
