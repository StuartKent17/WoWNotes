Blue Tweets

We have been, and are continuing to make, significant widespread changes to damage and healing amounts. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464701906430865409
.On a related note, everyone, when you see datamining of the next build, DON'T FREAK OUT. We're doing things to adjust... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464703086703828992
....damage across the board for the 6.0 numbers, and that includes reducing a *ton* of numbers. Fear not, we'll balance it. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464703267599970305
Will such datamining be "soon" or today? 
I have no idea when the next dataminable build will go up; could be any day. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464709955040198656

Are classes being reviewed holistically or round-robin? Are their any still on the to-do list? What are you working on atm?
It's actually rather free-form. Some things are a "Go down the list and make sure this is good for every spec." Some are... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464548287446798337
...more like "We're getting a lot of feedback about this spell/passive/rotation/whatever. Lets discuss potential changes." Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464548464714862593
Things I'm actively working on atm include mostly the spell visual filtering, along with design and implementation of... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464548630230499328
...a couple potential changes to Ursa Major, Blood AM, and Moonkin rotation. We work very collaboratively as a team, too. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464549374622978048
NOTE: Emphasis on *potential*. We try out ideas for potential changes all the time, and don't always go with them. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464550165874233345

And will we get your fancy new spell effect filtering in 6.0, or we have to wait for WoD? :3 Swapping 10 -> 25 really hurts atm!
6.0. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464718455648694272

i have aa high end, i dont need any visual reduction.
A You do, for gameplay clarity reasons, not FPS performance reasons. B Yes, it'll be an option. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464722068441800705

totally agree."hybrid" used to mean something.now raid cds are taken away from hybrids and given to pure dps?
The way you're wording it makes it sound like we're removing all of it. That's not the case. If you imagine each spec's... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465115154233823232
...stackable raid utility as a digit, we're changing the world from "1122334444555555566" to "2222222222222222222". Make sense? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465115402788302849

Is Necrotic Strike really absorbing 100% of attack power in WOD instead of 225% on live ? Or is the tooltip still bugged in WOD
What "100% of Attack Power" means has changed. Formulae aren't comparably like that between 5.4 and 6.0. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464700143095144448
Yep, I know, 100% in WOD is like 50% on live. So 100% NS comared to 225% on live is like a 4/5 nerf !
It's simply not that simple. Rest assured, it won't be a useless button, as you fear. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464702035112116224

still feel like the level 75 soon 60 dk talents are the worst in game. No other class requires talents for resource generation
Why does it matter to you whether a core part of your gameplay comes from talents or from baseline skills? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464709556539363328
it's not as much that as it is that the dk talents aren't compelling in any way. No choices that add depth to our gameplay.
Not sure what you're talking about. Which rune regen talent you take has a big impact on your gameplay, and adds depth. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464719209381912576
yes, they have a big impact on how we play. In that they're required in order for us to not have obscene amounts of downtime.
Curious; I hear talking like this thrown around often, but I'm dubious of how many people even try playing without for comparison. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464720600515104768
you ever tried leveling a dk now from scratch? The difference is immediate, noticeable, and immense.
Yes, and that has a ton to do with gear and abilities available as well. Fact is, that row accounts for about 10-15% of your GCDs. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464721558942912513
And that's big, certainly, especially feeling-wise, which is why we moved it down to lvl 60 for 6.0. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464721850077937665
I don't think you truly understand DK's. If you don't choose BT you're doing it wrong.
I think you may be confusing "Unholy DKs in PvP" for "All DKs". BT is not used by the majority of DKs, and they're not wrong. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464805151572639744

Will the new Pestilence be usable without a target, like current Blood Boil? A very useful counter against stealth in PvP!
Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465617474751180800

am I going to have to actually use army or us it going back to being a cosmetic thing?
It'll be instant, and worth using, at least on the pull. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465629937123090432

Raidwide healing recieved is way too big raid utility when other dps healing utility gone. Raids will stack mages
Why would they stack Mages? Where's the logic? Your "way too big" seems to be based on hyperbole, not fact. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464833699595313152
Thats my point - stacking Mages will save heal. therefore I take 5-6 Mages as dps and can afford less healer
A 12% increase to healing received is minor. Same as Smoke Bomb. Or Rallying Cry. Or all the others competing. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464806186089316352

But mages already have bloodlust, iceblock, frost ring, etc. Why do they need another?
Bloodlust is not stackable raid utility. It's like being able to give a crit buff. Ice Block and Ring of Frost are... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464832577434431488
...extremely small, in the grand scheme of things, as far as raid utility goes, in most situations. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464832900978847744
With that logic why not give every class a bloodlust? Don't get why mages get love over rogues who need it
Because you have raid buffs and debuffs in order to make you stronger in a group, and diversify compositions. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464833942084788224

The problem is that you give a DPS a stackable raidwide "Heal-Support" skill like Amplify Magic for Mages...
Yes, we give them a small one, because they had none, and lower everyone else down to equally small. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464718088965873665

The mirror images will get their spell power increase but will they get health/resist as well? For more survivability.
Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465617534398365697

Any chance we see a variation of Cone of Cold for arcane? Maybe "Arcane Pulse" - Push back and increased dmg?
Arcane's AoE is naturally a short range instant; too much overlap. Supernova is somewhat similar to what you describe. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465618301704364032

Is there any chance for Glyph of Touch of Death and Glyph of Touch of Karma to become baseline in WoD? They kinda feel mandatory
Glyph of Touch of Death is a kiss/curse; definitely not mandatory, at all. Glyph of Touch of Karma is strong, especially in Arenas. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464708053946740736
Also i don't see how to use Karma while being slowed, rooted or feared to china. That Glyph is a must have, no room for decision
In many cases, those are bad times to use ToK anyway. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464710276537778176
How should i get off a ToK against a ranged then? I'd like to set it on my target not some rnd pet standing next to me.
Presumably, the same way you punch that ranged. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464718271069945858

any chance that chi torpedo be changed for ww to be something competitive with rjw and xuen?
Chi Torpedo is lacking for everyone, since RJW was changed to its current version. We're considering potential changes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464725840077393920

Why does BrM taunt have 10y longer range and have the movement on application?
Why not? WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/464903346566881281
Taunt is simple ability. Why would 1 out of 5 taunts be better in every way?
Brewmasters have the best taunt though I could see someone saying DKs do. Doesn't mean they're the best tank. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/464910274311372801

Problem with that is it takes 2 globals for monks to do as much ST healing as other healers do in 1.
Not actually. Soothing only has a 0.5sec GCD. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465275510969217024
well this is new, it will still take longer to switch targets after a surging though
If you're only doing 1 Surging, perhaps. It also is more front loaded. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465276707885174786
Won't just 1 surging be fairly common though in world where spot healing is necessary and encouraged?
Soothing would be better in this case. Surging on top if you really have to. And of course Renewing. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465617439649050625

Any changes being discussed about AoW for Rets? Worried that if exo is low priority again that it'll be an unused proc again.
Kinda confused about why people focus on AoW; it's just Exo that's weak, nothing specific to AoW. Just a tuning issue. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464827354297024512
If it's just a tuning issue why wasn't there a hotfix on it?
Because we didn't want to change Ret's rotation through a hotfix. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464879498169577472
Not rebalancing classes through hotfixes "mid xpack" feels lazy from your part. Hello Disc... zzzZzzZz
Mid-expansion is different from mid-patch. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464903214639230976
You changed Kil'jaeden's cunning. Sure it's a talent but it affected their rotation. I know exo...

spriest Halo fix? Specific addon + guess work isn't nice. Against blizz spell design as well? Make it more forgiving pls?
It's actually extremely forgiving. We've never found the addon to be mandatory or even a noticeable gain. You get ~max effect... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464827730555441152

Or do you really think that removing the DR cap on the L90 talents was a good move?
We've talked about this previously. I've said that uncapping Priest L90 talents was a huge mistake. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464907339053543424

I agree to some extent, I believe if ShadowStep was on a 15-16 second cd it would on par with BoS and more competitive
it's ironic as BoS was buffed to keep up with Shadowstep...which used to be a 24 second cooldown holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/465185361874800640

The current numbers imply BS will be much more superior to Hemo in WoD compared to now.
