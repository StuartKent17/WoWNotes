Warlords of Draenor - Gathering Professions
Today we are taking a look at the changes to Mining, Herbalism, and Skinning in Warlords of Draenor, as well as the garrison buildings that accompany them.

Mining

Two new types of ore: Blackrock Ore  and True Iron Ore  
Warlords of Draenor removes the smelting step and uses ores directly. 
No need to go to a trainer to increase your Mining cap, just go to Draenor and start playing, A Treatise on Mining in Draenor  will drop from a mob or appear when gathering something.
You can now mine any node at any level and you will receive Nuggets  instead of the normal ore if your skill level is too low. Nuggets can be combined  to form ore.
You will also receive Draenic Stone  when mining in Draenor, which is used for work orders at your garrison's mine 
Ore is acquired in several ways:

Drops from Goren Protector  while mining. 
Mined from deposits  found in the world.
Everyone can collect some ore daily from their garrison's mine  
Purchased ;_! with Garrison Resources  from the Trading Post  in your garrison.
Contained in salvage containers  from your garrison's Salvage Yard.

The Goren Protector  that will occasionally spawn and attack you has a low chance to drop the Red Goren Egg  Ore Eater  pet.



Herbalism

Seven new herbs: Talador Orchid , Starflower , Nagrand Arrowbloom , Gorgrond Flytrap , Frostweed , Fireweed , Chameleon Lotus 
No need to go to a trainer to increase your Herbalism cap, just go to Draenor and start playing, A Compendium of the Herbs of Draenor  will drop from a mob or appear when gathering something.
You can now herb any node at any level and you will receive fragments  instead of the normal herb if your skill level is too low. Fragments can be combined  to form herbs.
You will also receive Draenic Seeds  when gathering herbs in Draenor, which is used for work orders and purchasing items at your garrison's herb garden 
Herbs are acquired in several ways:

Drops from Disturbed Podling  while gathering herbs. 
Gathered from nodes  found in the world.
Everyone can collect some herbs daily from their garrison's herb garden  
Purchased www.wowdb.com/items/109129-talador-orchid#related:sold-by;_! with Garrison Resources  from the Trading Post  in your garrison.
Contained in salvage containers  from your garrison's Salvage Yard.

The Disturbed Podlings  that will occasionally spawn and attack you have a low chance to drop the Nightshade Sproutling  Nightshade Sproutling  pet.



Skinning

One new skin: Raw Beast Hide 
No need to go to a trainer to increase your Skinning cap, just go to Draenor and start playing, A Guide to Skinning in Draenor  will drop from a mob or appear when gathering something.
You can now skin any skinnable animal at any level and you will receive fragments  instead of the normal skin if your skill level is too low. Fragments can be combined  to form useful skins.
You can also obtain skins from your garrison's barn  
Skins are also contained in salvage containers  from your garrison's Salvage Yard.



Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons: Herb Garden
The Herb Garden  has its own plot that no other buildings can be placed upon. Everyone with a garrison has access to this building and is able to gather from the nodes, even without the Herbalism profession.

Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons: Mines
The Lunarfall Excavation / Frostwall Mines  has its own plot that no other buildings can be placed upon. Everyone with a garrison has access to this building and is able to mine the nodes inside, even without the Mining profession.

EU Feedback Thread Comment in Documentary
We do get valuable feedback from the EU forums, both directly from the English forums and translated/summarized by members of our Community team from the other language forums. I winced a little bit at that quote in the documentary as well, just because I knew it might be taken the wrong way.

For full context, for those who weren't participating or around during the early days of our Warlords beta testing, the first day of raid testing was a mess. We scheduled a Butcher test as our first raid test of the expansion and the massive number of people trying to zone in at once was chain-crashing our instance servers due to a bug that we found and fixed within a few hours, thanks to the data obtained from monitoring testers. I had made specific feedback threads on both the NA and EU forums as I always do for the boss, and unsurprisingly the threads ended up being dominated by comments about server stability with little useful info about the bosses themselves. That's why I said "there is actually some genuine feedback..." - we'd written off the test as something that wasn't likely to yield anything constructive at all.

In general, we get and use tons of useful feedback from our EU raid tests. As I said on Twitter, that brief clip was about this one specific thread, and was not a general statement.

You have to admit scrolling past the Picard facepalm ASCII made for some fine comic timing alongside my comments, though - kudos to the editing team for that pairing. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 


Warlords Launch Q&A, Live Wednesday Nov 12th!
This Wednesday, I’ll be joining World of Warcraft Lead Game Designer Ion Hazzikostas and Lead Class Designer Kris Zierhut to answer your questions live on Twitch.TV! With Warlords of Draenor’s launch only a couple of days away, we’re sure there’s plenty of questions we weren’t able to answer at BlizzCon, and now is your chance to ask them!

When: Wednesday, November 12th, 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM Pacific Standard Time see this handy tool  to find when that is in your local time!
Where: The World of Warcraft channel on Twitch.TV/WoW 

There are two ways to submit questions. If you’re using Twitter, simply tweet your question using the hashtag #WarlordsQA. You can also ask it as a reply to this forum thread; however, as we’d like to get to as many questions as possible, we will only consider questions using 40 words or less. Make them count! In order to be considered, your question must be submitted before 12:01 AM PST on Wednesday, November 12th.

See you there!

Classes
could you maybe make it so you don't have to glyph something random first before you can swap two incompatible glyphs?
Yes we'd like to improve that. In the mean time, you can just right-click a glyph to remove it. holinka 

Character / Items
I just got Gromloc & added him & got no Achievement. I hope this is a bug.
Fixed in 6.1, our apologies, you will retroactively achieve your FoS. Muffinus 

Blazing Wings have a minor graphical glitch on some models like the legendary cloak did, hangs out to the side w/Magical Ogre Idol
Global art fix, tasked, not likely to make it in a hotfix, but we'll make these attachment points consistent for all items. Muffinus 

Blazing Wings buff disappearing on Druid shapeshift while other transformation buffs don't disappear. Bug or intended?
Need to fix some attachment points, they'll make a return as will other back-attached items. Muffinus 

PvE
If a raid ignores Highmaul optional bosses and kills Imperator, will the optional bosses still be there later?
Yes. WatcherDev 

PvP
When does season 16 will start? I can't find it on the internet. Thanks for answering
December 2nd holinka 
is it gonna be season 16 or WoD Season 1?
WoD Season 1 holinka 
so wait is anything going to change on the system how I get HP and CP or you guysjust trying names?
just names holinka 

when does honor gear get released?
It releases with Warlords holinka 

Color of arena flags annoy me. IMO They are hard to identify too faint? which is yellow and which is green. Consider change them?
Yes considering it. holinka 

Have you guys ever tested objective-based 5v5? I loved how GW2 did it in SPvP, so I'm wondering how well it'd work in WoW.
think it might play pretty well but where does it fit in the broader PVP picture. We have a lot already. We'll see. holinka 
Also nothing stopping people from trying some 5v5 war games. I recommend 2 orb ToK. holinka 

I thought you weren't going to be allowed to switch specs in a BG? Just watched a DK switch from his dps spec to blood. Intended?
it only prevents switching from healer to non-healer specs. System intent is balancing healers on each team. holinka 

with crafted pvp sets I felt like I had a fighting chance coming in late but now I'll have to suffer to get bags, how is that fun?
Instead of contenders sets we just level up the gear in battlegrounds and arenas holinka 

Will levelling through PvP ever be as equal-speed to PvE levelling? I want to PvP to 100 on my main and wondering how fast it'd be?
Questing is intended to be the fastest way to level and gear up for an expansion. holinka 

if you guys could give the option to hide your zone or queue inside a rbg it will be huge so players don't spend hours dodging
yeah the hidden presence one is certainly something to consider holinka 

Reputation / Questing
but its irrelevant content on chars that are boosted, no challange, and natural play can miss the bulk of 1-90 via speed
Absolutely don't disagree. I think "any zone at any level" could be a lot of fun at some point in the future. Muffinus 

Garrisons
I mean daily quests that we're currently holding in our quest log. Rumors that they'll be reset so people don't get a jump on lvln
Not 100% sure, but with no concept of realm first 100, I'd suggest exploring Draenor. Lots of rares, garrison stuff, etc. Muffinus 
I've experienced the zones plenty ! I'm more concerned with min/maxing my route and time to get ahead of the crowd,
Worth thinking about: garrison resources are finite and very important for garrison progression. Suggest min-maxing that. Muffinus
