There are teleport stations that lead to Dalaran (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/7502-dalaran) and Orgrimmar (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/1637-orgrimmar) usable by the Horde as well as all of your favorite characters from the Suramar campaign, such as Thalyssra (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/98312-first-arcanist-thalyssra) and Theryn (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/104618-theryn). Pandaren monks have also arrived to teach the Nightborne the ways of the http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk class.<br>
