Blue Posts
Tanking
Swipe Nerf / Thunderclap and Tank Threat boost
We had already nerfed Swipe before I saw this conversation, because it was pretty far out in front of other tank AE dps. Thunder Clap's coefficient is something like 0.10 and that could probably be 0.20, which would bring it more in line.

We are also talking a lot about just buffing tank threat across the board, because we've heard a lot recently that it's still too twitchy. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026377623/thunderclap-is-too-weak/

Tanking classes cannot AE Tank anymore
That actually isn't an intended change. We don't want AE healing to be trivial. I'll use some examples:

A Pile of 20 whelps. Go ahead and AE tank this and ask your dps to AE too. You probably don't even need Shield Slam.

B One giant. I wouldn't use Thunder Clap at all on this, except as needed to keep the debuff up. We want Thunder Clap to be terrible for holding single targets. I don't think many tanks would argue this point.

C A pack of 4 targets that you plan to burn down one at a time. Here is the biggest point of contention. Thunder Clap should be fine for establishing initial aggro though Shockwave will be better, and it should be fine for keeping add #3 off of the healer. But you should feel like you have to go to town with single target abilities on add #1 that the dps are all focused on. Then you should switch attention to add #2. In Lich King, it was too easy to just hold this whole group with Thunder Clap spam, and to be fair, the dps would just AE as well.

D The same pack as in C, but this time you decide to CC add #3 and #4. In this case, you should be able to live fine without Thunder Clap at all unless you really need the debuff. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026377623/thunderclap-is-too-weak/

[...] Right. If you are trying to AE tank and a bad dps is attacking the wrong target and dies, we call that justice. If you are trying to AE tank and a healer pulls aggo, then threat generation is just too low and we need to buff it. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026377623/thunderclap-is-too-weak/

Cannot macro Lifebloom while in Tree of Life on Beta
This is a dumb limitation of our macro system, where it gets confused if you have two spells with the same name. In this case, the Tree of Life Lifebloom is actually a different spell than normal Lifebloom. The macro tries to cast normal Lifebloom, sees that you can't because it isn't allowed in Tree of Life, and just bails. Lifebloom is not the only spell in this category.

We understand why this is bad and are working on a fix. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026396849/druids-heals-need-help/
