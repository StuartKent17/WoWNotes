<br>
New tech is being used in the Kil&apos;jaeden encounter, called Fog of War internally. You have limited vision, so you have to use the help of your allies to make your way through that phase. <br>
On lower difficulties, the team just may remove mechanics if they will have to be tuned down to a point where players won&apos;t care about them anymore.<br>
There will be a shortcut once you defeat Maiden four times. <br>
Raid tuning isn&apos;t done with specific legendary items in mind, just the power increase that comes from two legendary items. <br>
Mythic is tuned around the power increase from players having the Concordance trait. <br>
Normal or Heroic aren&apos;t tuned around having a specific class or spec. In Mythic the team tries to come up with multiple ways to complete a mechanic rather than requiring one class or spec. For example, adding a mechanic that requires either a spellsteal or mind control.<br>
Mythic only phases aren&apos;t required when designing final raid bosses. The team just does it when it fits. <br>
Titanforged and Warforged do give players a rare chance to get nicer loot, but if you compare a Mythic group and Heroic group, the Mythic group will have a higher item level. <br>
The team doesn&apos;t have plans to add a spectator mode for raids right now. There is a concern that guilds would recruit a coach and their role is to watch and direct the raid rather than play the game.<br>

Patch 7.2.5 - New Legendary Item Sources<br>
Blizzard shared some information about the source of the new legendary items (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=23910&amp;filter-ilvl-min=910&amp;filter-quality=32) coming in Patch 7.2.5.<br>
Are the new ring legendaries a quest reward or just random drop?<br>
The new legendaries added in Patch 7.2.5 will be new drops, available through the existing system. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/869611706799882240))<br>
<br>
Is there a point in hoarding nethershards right now? Will they be usable for tomb gear once the tomb releases?<br>
Relinquished items purchased with Nethershards are not being updated with Tomb of Sargeras or Patch 7.2.5 and there&apos;s no need to hoard them. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/870700747427504128))<br>
But they will be able to proc the new legendaries right?<br>
Legendary items that are being added to the game in Patch 7.2.5 will not be obtainable from Relinquished tokens. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/870704885234139137))<br>

7.2.5 Enhancement Class Discussion<br>
Windstrike should correctly proc Unleash Doom in this PTR build.<br>
<br>
Windstrike&apos;s cooldown should correctly be reduced to 15s (i.e. 3s during Ascendance) in the next PTR build.<br>
<br>
Stormflurry incorrectly proccing T20 should be fixed in the next PTR build. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1058152-725-enhancement-class-discussion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753747916?page=31#616))<br>

Elemental Discussions - 7.2.5<br>
Hey guys.<br>
<br>
So, part of the reason we haven&apos;t had much to share about Elemental is that we don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything fundamentally wrong with the spec. Most of the changes you&apos;ve seen to other specs in 7.2.5 thus far have been focused around addressing core mechanical issues. We&apos;ve only recently begun the process of making changes intended to bring each spec&apos;s performance more in line with the others.<br>
<br>
The bulk of the feedback we&apos;re seeing (in this thread and others) is that Elemental is fun to play, it just doesn&apos;t deal enough damage in certain situations. That&apos;s the sort of situation that we&apos;ll solve through what we generally refer to as &quot;tuning&quot; - e.g, adjusting things like how much damage a spell does, the chance for an effect to activate, and so on. Based on the feedback, those sound like the sort of changes we&apos;d consider for Elemental.<br>
<br>
Note that how we define a &quot;mechanical change&quot; vs &quot;tuning&quot; can be a bit blurry, which makes it difficult for us to communicate things like this sometimes. Suffice it to say that changes intended to alter the way you play your class are generally considered mechanical, while changes that simply adjust how effective your class is in certain situations are generally considered tuning. That&apos;s still not a perfect explanation but hopefully it helps.<br>
<br>
Moreover, tuning isn&apos;t a process that&apos;s ever really &quot;complete.&quot; We constantly monitor class performance and make adjustments where we think they&apos;ll help, and fully expect to continue that in the weeks after Patch 7.2.5 releases. Additionally, it&apos;s important to remember that the effectiveness of your spec is measured comparatively to other specs; in other words, tuning down an overpowered spec is an indirect buff to everyone else. Sometimes - and I&apos;m not saying this is the case for Elemental, because I&apos;m honestly not certain off the top of my head - we&apos;ll decide that it&apos;s better to bring an outlier down than it is to buff everyone else.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the core of what I&apos;m trying to get across here is that Elemental is definitely on our radar as a spec to pay close attention to as we continue class tuning for 7.2.5. We&apos;ll be keeping an eye on Elemental&apos;s performance as we continue the tuning process.<br>
<br>
However do you not think earthshock damage relative to our other spells and substituting earthquake in single target are possible design flaws?<br>
I can&apos;t speak to it personally (I just finished leveling my Shaman a couple weeks ago and I mostly stick to Enhance or Resto) but these are the sorts of things we&apos;d generally look to address via tuning.

Blue Tweets<br>
What will happen with mithyc guldan mount? will still be 100% until expansion ends? or only until ToS goes up?<br>
The mount is a guaranteed drop until the end of the Legion expansion, and will then be treated like similar mounts from previous expansions. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/867790018428911617))<br>
<br>
Will we be able to cross realm Mythic ToV and Nighthold when 7.2.5 launches?<br>
Yes, you&apos;ll be able to form cross-realm groups for Mythic difficulty ToV and Nighthold in Patch 7.2.5. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/867788773303607296))<br>
