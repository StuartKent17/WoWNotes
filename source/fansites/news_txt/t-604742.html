Tigole posting something about the PTR being online &quot;very soon&quot; on friday could mean something very good, I suggest that you stay online a few more minutes/hours just in case. ^^<br>
There are some changes coming to WSG in patch 2.4. The patch will be on the PTR very soon. Please be sure to check out Warsong once the PTR is up.<br>
