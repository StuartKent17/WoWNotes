New items in 2.2
13 New gems  have been added to the game. We still don't know where the one without a plan drop Hyjal Trash ?

[item=33173] plans now drop from an unknown creature in Shadowmoon Valley. Mostly to replace the overnerfed [item=31436], see below

Patch Notes
General
Voice Chat - The new Voice Chat feature is now available in game. Players will need to go into the options menu under Sound & Voice to activate it. Volume sliders are available for the microphone, speakers, and game-audio fade which automatically lowers the game audio when a voice communication is received, as is a “push-to-talk” setting. Right-clicking on a player’s name now includes the option to mute or unmute that player. Muting another player blocks all voice chat from him or her; the ignore feature now blocks both voice chat and text chat from that player.
Chat Channels- New Chat Channel controls and functionality are now available under the chat tab in the Social Window of the interface. The interface will now show the channels players are in or are available, depending on the area of the world they are in, along with new private channel controls.
A new feature for reporting players as being AFK in battlegrounds by right clicking has been added. When enough reports are registered, a 30 second debuff will begin to count down. Once the timer is up a new debuff will appear that will prevent the player from gaining any honor while it is on. This debuff can be negated as soon as the player engages in combat.
Haste: Haste has been rebalanced. It has returned to the ratios from the launch of Burning Crusade. Melee attacks and spell casts will now benefit at identical rates from haste. This change results in a reduction in the benefit of haste for melee attacks and an increase in the benefit for spellcasters.
Troll Berserk: The spell haste on this ability was incorrectly too high and has been corrected.
Resilience Rating: The reduction to the percent chance to get a critical strike now also reduces the damage dealt by damage over time effects by the same percentage.
Area Spells: In some cases guards in neutral areas would not aggro against pvp attacks from area spells. That is now fixed.
Corrected the damage modifier calculation for Resilience when the attacker has bonus critical strike damage.
Power Regeneration: Any effect which triggers a change in your rate of power regeneration Mana, Rage, Energy, Focus will now cause an immediate reward of some power at the old rate of increase, and then begin new “ticks” of power at the new rate approximately 2 seconds later. This was done to improve functionality of abilities such as Evocation and Innervate so that they did not have wasted “ticks”.
Mac Movie Capture: the Mac client can now capture in-game video to QuickTime movie files using a configurable choice of codec, resolution, and frame rate. Two new entries have been added to the Key Bindings dialog for start/stop recording and for cancellation of a recording. For more detailed configuration options please see the Mac Options panel in game. Mac OS X 10.4.9 and QuickTime 7.1.6 or better are required. Not all machines have enough performance to smoothly capture video at high frame rates; end user experimentation will be required to find appropriate settings for each system.
Pets are now affected by Paladin greater blessings.
Kill Triggered Effects: Effects that trigger from killing your target will no longer trigger from killing your pet.
Non-combat pets may not be selected as the target for spells or abilities.
Non-combat pets now have the tag "Companion" instead of "Minion".

Meeting Stones can no longer be used to summon players that do not meet the level requirements.

The mana regained never drops below 10% of intellect every 5 sec. or goes above 50% of intellect every 5 sec.
