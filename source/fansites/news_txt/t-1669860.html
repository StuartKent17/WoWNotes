Happy New Year!<br>
As we mark the end of 2014, it&#x2019;s time to ring in 2015 all across Azeroth. Beginning today, December 31, the skies above all the major cities will be filled with glorious fireworks!<br>
<br>

<br>
Every hour on the hour, look to the skies for a dazzling display of explosions as you&apos;re sipping brews and tasting delicious foodstuffs.<br>
<br>
Join the festivities and say hello to the new year! One word of caution, though&#x2014;if you&#x2019;re planning to enjoy the fireworks in Booty Bay, word has it the guards there have been celebrating a bit too hard and aren&#x2019;t likely to enforce the town rules.<br>

So thank you, to the overwhelming majority that are genuinely good gracious people. Jerks are the exception so they often stand out. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/547938331842334722))<br>
