chaud2019-01-08, 08:23 PMPatch 8.1.5 PTR Developers Notes
We’re underway with the deployment of our first build of WoW 8.1.5 to our Public Test Realms. We expect it to be playable soon, and we want to start discussions about the features of the update that we’ll be testing:


The Kul Tiran Allied Race unlock
The Zandalari Allied Race unlock
Naga invasion World Quests
New portal rooms in faction capitals
The next chapter of pet battle Raiding with Leashes
Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin visual improvements


Our testing in this first build will be primarily technical, so some 8.1.5 features will be locked/unavailable for the first few days while we work on initial concerns:


New War Campaign quests
New quests and questlines focused on Magni, Hati, and the eight non-gathering primary Professions
Warlords of Draenor Timewalking dungeons
New Brawl in Arathi Basin vs. AI
Wintergrasp coming to the Epic Battleground list
New Brawler’s Guild update
New Darkmoon Faire roller coaster
New Micro-holidays and updates to Children’s Week


Additionally, you may see some features referenced in this PTR such as Ashran as an Epic Battleground that are not part of 8.1.5, but may be introduced in a later update. We’ll keep an eye out for such things and make sure to let you know what we aren’t testing in this PTR.
As always, thank you for your testing and feedback.
