Boubouille2012-11-01, 06:01 PMGoogle Alert when visiting MMO-Champion - Final Update
Earlier today MMO-Champion got flagged as "unsafe" by Google, resulting in a big ass http://xkcd.com/37/ warning message every time you tried to access the site explaining that MMO-Champion will eat your soul. Well good news, MMO-Champion doesn't eat souls!

This is what happened in a nutshell.

In the morning an ad network got compromised and ended up serving a malware. This is a pretty popular/high-end ad network and I'm not sure if I can give away the name without getting my ass kicked. I'll let them do their own communication 
We disabled ads as soon as the first warning appeared.
MMO-Champion or any of our infrastructure wasn't compromised, this was entirely 3rd party. 
Since it's 3rd party and it's always better to be safe than sorry, take this as an opportunity to run a good old Malwarebytes Anti Malware www.malwarebytes.org scan on your computer. 


Obviously we apologize for the inconvenience.
