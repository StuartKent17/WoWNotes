<br>
The BlizzCon 2016 online merchandise sale for attendees and Virtual Ticket holders is now scheduled to kick off October 12!<br>
<br>
While you wait for the store to open, check out the preview below for a sneak peek at just a sample of what&#x2019;s coming to the store.<br>
<br>
If you&#x2019;d like to participate in this year&#x2019;s BlizzCon sale, simply order a BlizzCon 2016 Virtual Ticket (https://us.battle.net/shop/en/product/blizzcon-virtual-ticket). Once you purchase your Virtual Ticket, your Battle.net account will automatically be flagged to purchase BlizzCon items from the Blizzard Gear Store during the sale, from October 12 to November 6.<br>
<br>
If you&#x2019;re attending the show in person, you should have already received a code to redeem this year&#x2019;s digital bonuses&#x2014;including a Virtual Ticket and access to the BlizzCon merch sale&#x2014;on one Battle.net account. These codes were emailed directly to ticket buyers, so if you received a ticket through a friend or family member, check with them for your code.<br>
<br>
<br>
Patch 7.1 Reputation Changes<br>
Reputation will not be made account-wide, no, but we will be easing a couple of linked features with 7.1.<br>
<br>
First, Court of Stars and The Arcway will now unlock account-wide once each individual dungeon is completed once on an account.<br>
<br>
Second, World Quests will no longer have the &quot;friendly&quot; reputation unlock requirement for secondary/alt characters. Once you hit 110 on an alt, you will immediately receive a quest to speak with Khadgar to receive your Flight Master&apos;s Whistle and unlock World Quests, as long as you&apos;ve already unlocked World Quests on your main.<br>
<br>
Hope this answers your concerns!<br>
<br>

Hunter Feedback<br>
Popping in to say we&apos;ve been reading all the feedback here, and we have really appreciated everything posted so far.<br>
<br>
We&apos;ve already made some changes based off feedback we&apos;ve received in this thread and others, and we will continue to iterate and tune classes as needed. I don&apos;t have any direct updates on what changes will be coming when for Hunters, but the class is definitely on our radar.

Hi, is Fury of the Eagle meant to be on the GCD? It was off GCD initially, but there has been no official response post hotfix<br>
Yes. Fury of the Eagle (a standard damage ability) bypassing the GCD was incorrect, and we hotfixed it to be on the GCD as intended. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/781977927265103872))<br>
