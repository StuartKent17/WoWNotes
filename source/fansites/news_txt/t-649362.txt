Boubouille2009-05-20, 08:17 AMXT-002 Hard Mode US First Kill by VANQUISH
Earlier today VANQUISH  US-Cho'gall killed XT-002 in Hard Mode. As announced earlier today the achievement was nerfed in patch 3.1.2  and I'd rather not call it world first to start another discussion on US/EU servers getting patched first/last. Note: Still a world first, technically


 

Extra Champion's Seals in 3.1.2
Small update on the Argent Tournament rewards, the Champion's Purse  now has a chance to drop a Champion's Seal  It will probably help you get your Argent Hippogryph  faster, especially with the lowered price

Nitro Boots Shut Down in Arena
After several attempts to balance the Nitro Boots ability in the arena, we have decided that we currently do not have an acceptable solution. Until we are able to better balance this ability it has been shut down in the arenas. We fully plan to continue working on this item and we intend to adjust it in upcoming patches. 

We have plans to make certain that this item is still worth the investment made in it. So don't vendor it just yet. Source

Buffs to Fury and Arms
We do have buffs planned for Arms and Fury. We'll announce them when they are a little closer to going live. I don't want to oversell them because players sometimes get notions of seeing their dps go up by 25%.

It's also entirely possible dps buffs might come with PvP nerfs. Warrior representation in Arena went from very low to very high. Source 

Arms and Fury in PvE/PVP
I should have found the original quote, but someone above thought that I was saying we needed to nerf Fury for PvP. We're not worried that Fury is overpowered in PvP. We are worried that Arms might be overpowered in PvP.

Arms PvE -- dps too low
Fury PvE -- dps too low
Arms PvP -- possibly too good but we'll see how 3.1.2 goes
Fury PvP -- not concerned about it being too good Source
