WoW Classic Live in One Hour
The much anticipated release of World of Warcraft Classic is almost here! Realm populations are High almost across the board and a new French realm was just opened 

Q: Will I need to pay for access to WoW Classic?
A: Everyone with active game time or a subscription to World of Warcraft will have access to WoW Classic.

Q. Can I use WoW Tokens in WoW Classic?
A. You won’t be able to buy and sell WoW Tokens in WoW Classic, but you can buy and sell them in World of Warcraft and use them toward your game time.

Q. Will my computer be able to run WoW Classic?
A. You can find a complete list of minimum system specifications for both Windows and Mac in our WoW Classic Primer post here  The recommended requirements are the same for WoW Classic as they are for World of Warcraft.

Q: How do I access WoW Classic?
A: You’ll need to access the game through the Battle.net desktop app.



Open the Battle.net desktop app and select World of Warcraft from the side menu.
Under the Version menu, select World of Warcraft Classic. If you have more than one World of Warcraft account, you’ll see a second dropdown for Account. Select the active account you wish to play on from that column.
Click the Install button. The progress bar will show you when the game is available to play.
Once the installation is complete, click the Play button.

Classic PvP Content Plan
As was the case when World of Warcraft originally launched in 2004, there won’t be a formal PvP system in WoW Classic at the outset. You’ll still be able to PvP, of course, and there will be no Dishonorable Kills, so you’ll be free to repeatedly hunt down every player and NPC in, say, Stranglethorn Vale to your stealthy heart’s content.

That’ll change once phase 2 rolls around and we add the Honor System, which will introduce Honorable Kills, Dishonorable Kills, and PvP Rank Rewards. The items you earn from the PvP Rank Rewards will be the versions from patch 1.12. Keep in mind though, just as it did originally, it will require a substantial time investment to rank up through the Honor System. For those interested in the Rank Rewards, earning epic gear will require consistent dedication over a long period of time as a top contributor on your realm. We don’t expect to see many people running around with these items early on, but we’re certain Hillsbrad Foothills will still see its fair share of action!

In the third phase, we’ll introduce the first Battlegrounds: Alterac Valley version 1.12  and Warsong Gulch, alongside with their associated vendors. One thing to note is that there were a couple of updates to these vendors over the course of the original patch releases, so some items won’t be available right away. For example, the Spell Penetration trinkets available from the Warsong Gulch vendor weren’t introduced until Patch 1.9, so we’re currently thinking that we’ll add these in phase 5.

The Arathi Basin Battleground will follow in phase 4, along with its specific vendor. It’ll be interesting to see how many people stay behind to guard the flag. 

Finally, in phase 6, we’ll have the world PvP objectives in Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands, which will come out at the same time as Naxxramas.

Here’s what the PvP content looks like mapped to the phases we recently posted about:

Phase 1 WoW Classic Launch

You can PvP one another in the world, but there is no tracking, and no formal rewards for doing so.

Honor System including Dishonorable Kills
PvP Rank Rewards


Phase 3

Alterac Valley version 1.12
Warsong Gulch


Phase 4

Arathi Basin


Phase 6

World PvP objectives in Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands



Layering
Layers are used to make the population in a zone more reasonable at launch, creating multiple versions of the same zone on the same realm.


They are not cross-realm
Layers are only used so that an entire realm population isn't competing in one area at a time
The only way to shift into a different layer is through party invites from others on your server who are in a different layer
The layering tech tries to sticky you to a layer so that you see familiar names often.
Layering only exists to control population at launch and will not continue once numbers are stable
Blizzard is committed only having one layer per realm before the 2nd content phase goes live due to world bosses
