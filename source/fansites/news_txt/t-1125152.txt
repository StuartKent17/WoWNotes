Today we're continuing the armor sets preview with the Mists of Pandaria dungeon sets! Those armor models will be used on the rare gear you get in 5-man and heroic instances and they will most likely be the armor your characters will wear for a while before you actually clear raids and gear up! It's also a very nice opportunity to try something new on the website! 

New website feature - Image Gallery I'm giving another try at the whole image gallery thing! Clicking an image in this post will bring you to a very nice gallery that will let you browse through pictures easily. 


You can click the top right icon for a very fancy full screen mode. 
The original picture in full resolution is still available through the "Original" link at the bottom right. 
Using your left/right arrows keys to navigate between pictures should work, if you don't like clicking.
It should work fairly well, but don't hesitate to post bugs in comments.


And because I know you're going to ask. No mail dungeon set for the moment in the game files.

If you can read this, you're probably already too late to play one last time and you will have to wait for the May 15th release before you can try the game again! I'm sure you're already aware of it by now, but we'll be covering all your Diablo needs at Diablofans !
