Let&apos;s post something new today! The Throne of the Four Winds is the raid instance in Skywall, the elemental plane of Air. It will feature 2 encounters:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A fight against the &quot;Conclave of Wind&quot;, a Djinn council. (The Djinn model in the game files is the one used by Siamat (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/august/djinn2.jpg))<br>
A fight against Al&apos;akir, the Elemental Lord of Air. (No models yet)<br>
<br>
<br>
The instance looks similar to the Vortex Pinnacle (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1061-Skywall), the 5-man dungeon of Skywall and players will move between platforms with their flying mounts. <br>

Volley removed<br>
I know I&apos;m going to regret posting in this thread again, but I think it&apos;s the right thing to do so I&apos;ll take one for the team. :)<br>
<br>
We think Multi-Shot is a more interesting ability and can fill the hunter AE niche (along with Explosive Trap). We&apos;ll have to change Multi-Shot from the current version to get it there. I&apos;m very sorry if for some unusual reason Volley was your favorite spell as a hunter. We&apos;ve been trying to consolidate abilities and free up some bar space and having multiple AEs that competed with each other seems like a good area to hit up. The Volley and Multi-Shot niches were very similar, which resulted in the latter being dead. We wanted to pick one and we though Multi-Shot felt more huntery and less &quot;clunky&quot; (to use a favorite Wow forums term).<br>
<br>
Do consider that you won&apos;t be AE&apos;ing yourselves through Cataclysm content the way you do currently. When you do need to AE, hunters will have the tools to do so. In situations where you do have to AE, you are probably not also trying to CC. When you&apos;re back to the level of trivializing lower level content, nobody is going to say &quot;Don&apos;t bring a hunter. Their AE spam isn&apos;t spammy enough.&quot; We don&apos;t consider easily breaking rogues out of stealth a good reason to keep Volley around.<br>
<br>
I think that hits most of the reasonable concerns. I care much less about addressing the unreasonable ones. :)<br>

One Man Army<br>
Yes. Many of the problems we&apos;ve had with Ret are of the &quot;one man army&quot; category, where a paladin can do a lot of damage, then go defensive and heal themselves up. We love the kit of the paladin who can heal as well as do damage, but it needs to be tightly controlled. Word of Glory gives us that control. We have the room to make the spell really powerful because we know its on a tight cooldown and you sacrifice dps to use it. We can&apos;t do that today with say Flash of Light, because once you can cast one strong FoL, you can cast a bunch of them until you go OOM (at which point you Judge or Divine Plea, and you&apos;re going again). Similarly, we can make Selfless Healer nearly overpowered because you can&apos;t use it on yourself and because even with it you&apos;re not going to out compete a Holy paladin in healing. If you can occasionally contribute to group healing in tight spots, then that&apos;s great. That&apos;s some utility you can provide. (Note: Don&apos;t oversell this as &quot;I&apos;ll get brought to raids because of my healing.&quot;) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560848132/ret-primary-problems-with-build-12803/))<br>
<br>
Class balance and RNG<br>
That&apos;s the wrong view to take though. The equivalent would be &quot;I&apos;m balanced around getting a crit every swing, so when that doesn&apos;t happen, RNG screws me.&quot; You get a Templar&apos;s Verdict every 3 Crusader Strikes. Sometimes you get lucky and need fewer. You of course need to pay attention for when that happens and be able to react to it and alter your immediate plans. That right there is the element we think is most missing from today&apos;s Ret paladin. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560848132/ret-primary-problems-with-build-12803/))<br>
<br>
Words of Glory<br>
The amount it heals is most definitely balanced around how good it will be for Holy. <br>
Those numbers don&apos;t have to be the same though. The new talent tree design affords us a lot more flexibility in that regard. Part of the reason Word of Glory is so useful to Holy is because it costs no mana. Ret doesn&apos;t really care about mana, because it comes and goes easily, but a Ret generally won&apos;t be able to sit there and queue up several Holy Lights in a row. They will be able to sometimes use a Word of Glory though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560848132/ret-primary-problems-with-build-12803/))<br>
