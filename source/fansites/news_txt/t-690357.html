Just wanted to update players on the hotfixes that have been applied recently to Icecrown Citadel...<br>
<br>
Blood Prince Council<br>
<br>
Prince Keleseth will no longer melee players. So if you get knocked into Keleseth or happen to move by him, he won&apos;t swipe in between his casts and kill a non-tank.<br>
<br>
The first Shadow Resonance should appear earlier in the fight, which will allow the Keleseth tank to have more orbs on him or her if Keleseth is empowered second instead of third. We didn&apos;t want which Blood Prince was empowered second to be a major element of the difficulty in the fight.<br>
<br>
We reduced the melee damage for the Princes by 10% for the 10 player difficulty. They were doing less damage than the 25 player before the hotfix, but this change lowers the damage further.<br>
<br>
Empowered Flames will now run out of power after shooting fewer firebolts in the 10 player difficulty. We did not change the initial impact damage.<br>
<br>
Blood-Queen Lana&apos;thel<br>
<br>
The Blood-Queen is no longer spawned until the Blood Princes dies. This will prevent any unfortunate entry of her highness while a raid is fighting the Blood Princes. The initial hotfix for this causes the Blood-Queen to not spawn at all in a particular circumstance, but this was also fixed last night.<br>
<br>
We increased the duration of Essence of the Blood Queen to 60 seconds in 25 player difficulty, and 75 seconds in 10 player difficulty. A strategy developed for managing the Essences throughout the fight that involved intentionally killing a player, and this change addresses that strategy. The new timing does interact with some of her other abilities in new ways, but there are methods that players have to lessen that impact.</div></div>
