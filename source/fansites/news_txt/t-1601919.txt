Upcoming Tank Squish
Changes to mob damage are still ongoing, and it's something we're hand-tuning on a dungeon-by-dungeon and boss-by-boss basis. 

One issue that has likely been significantly impacting the feel of tanking in dungeons and in multi-mob scenarios, is some legacy logic from 5.4 Vengeance that is no longer needed or applicable in the current tanking environment. 

On live in Mists, Vengeance has diminishing returns with respect to damage taken from multiple targets, because such damage proved to be much less deadly in practice than the same amount from a single source. See this post for details: 

However, with the general increase in tank health with respect to incoming damage, and the move away from "spiky" damage intake, tanks spend much more time partly injured. In Mists, what killed tanks was sudden bursts of damage. In Warlords, what kills tanks is sustained damage that exceeds incoming healing and self-healing. And when it comes to sustained damage, it is immaterial whether you're being attacked by one huge enemy or many smaller enemies. 

Thus, we're removing any diminishing returns from Resolve when tanking multiple targets. A hotfix that makes this change should be in effect on beta within the next day. This should significantly improve survivability in dungeons and other multi-mob situations.

Thanks Watcher! Is there anything the community can do further to help with the tuning? i.e. run older dungeons at level appropriate
Being specific with your feedback, mainly. "My self-healing feels weak and healers can't keep me up, this feels terrible!" is valid feedback, but it's hard for us to address directly. On the other hand, "I was tanking Heroic Slag Mines on my premade DK and I couldn't survive the two-ogron pull before the last boss if I didn't have all my cooldowns up. They did way more damage than any boss in the dungeon." is very actionable.

Charhounds! Those firehounds from the Firelands. Flamewalkers and Dark Shamans tame them. Why not us? Would love one
I hate to say it, but man that would make a cool shaman glyph right? Spirit wolves -> fire wolves! Muffinus 

Art
Will we see "more paladin-like" Sets in WoD PvP&PvE? T17 is a good start 
We'll be continuing to find cool looks for tier sets that fit both class and context. Glad you enjoy T17! olandgren 

Character / Items
Tertiary Stats, Warforged, and Socket are random. 3 independent chances, max 1 of each. olandgren 

is Salvage yard intended to give the "Character Screen armours and weapons?
It is. They've rescued it from less... fortunate adventurers. olandgren 
Can we get them for any class or just our own? 
Just your own class.

Are you putting CM gear on the BMAH later on? That would be a slap in the face. Please don't. Hope it's just a rumor.
We have no plans to do so, but the BMAH does acquire some skill-based rewards so no promises either way. olandgren 

PvP
Skirmishes require a group queue? Or will solo queueing work on release?
Solo queueing works on release. holinka 

Can that meta gem please not make it to WoD? Please? Pretty please?
It is holinka 
But it's so random. The game should be about skill, not random reflects =
If I wasn't clear, it is gone in Warlords. holinka
