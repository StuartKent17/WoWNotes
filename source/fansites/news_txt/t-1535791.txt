Warlords of Draenor - Mage and Monk Tier 17 Armor Sets
The latest alpha build added the Mythic version of the Mage and Monk Tier 17 Armor sets. 

Warlords of Draenor changes things up slightly by using one set of art for Raid Finder, one set of art for Normal and Heroic, and one set of art for Mythic difficulty. You can find the Raid Finder armor sets in our Raid Finder armor sets preview http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3940-Warlords-of-Draenor-Raid-Finder-Armor-Sets-Draenei-Guard-Armor-Set-Blue-Tweets-Art.

Bloody Coin Hotfix Clarifications
Recently, several changes http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/319653-recent-bloody-coins-hotfixes/ have been made to how Bloody Coins are acquired. Lore provided some more information on the changes recently.
"more atractive" reads higher rate of acquiring them or chance to gain on HK as well as KB? And could you share the actual chances?
Previously, there was a 10 second ICD on getting a coin from a killing blow. That's been reduced significantly.
You'll only hit the ICD now if you're up to some serious exploit-y shenanigans. Source https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/477485547259449344
But will there be any chance of getting one on a HK? Healers would like to get coins too you know
Spoke with dev: not technically feasible atm. Opens up a ton of potential exploits ie: AFK farming coins
Would have to significantly rework the entire Bloody Coin mechanic to avoid those issues.
BUT: We recognize that healers got the short end here, and it's a lesson learned for the future.
So....besides Ashran then, any hope for us getting those coin rewards then short of pew pew? 
Not for Bloody Coins, unfortunately. But we'll do better in future mechanics. Source https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/477514500199813120


Patch 5.4.8 Hotfixes - June 13
Items

Censer of Eternal Agony http://www.wowdb.com/items/102467-censer-of-eternal-agony now has a cooldown of 1 hour when used up from 10 minutes.
Fire-Watcher's Oath http://www.wowdb.com/items/102463-fire-watchers-oath now has a cooldown of 10 minutes down from 1 hour and costs 100 Timeless Coins to purchase costs 50 Bloody Coins previously. The Ordon Fire-Watcher transformation now allows mount usage and Druid shapeshifting and significantly reduced the internal cooldown on earning Bloody Coins.


Timeless Isle

Non-rare creatures and NPCs on lower areas of Timeless Isle should now respawn more frequently.

Does resolve have reduced gains when tanking multiple targets? Or is that done since it isn't cheesing DPS?
Currently, yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474747892926668801

Any chance you could allow potions to not break stealth so it is easier to pre-pot and get an opener?
Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/475159103522615296

Aside from the passive fx of blood, using Pest and Death Strike, and filling with Death Coil doesn't really seem dif from UH
Death Coil is similar. Pestilence is shared but used in completely different ways. Everything else is completely different. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474723211364409346

are you taking out the warlock green fire quest in 6.0?
Nope. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/475395439642951680
And you get a Feat of Strength in 6.0 for having completed it before then?
Before Draenor unlocks, yes. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/475398935331086336

Art
With Garrosh gone, why are most of Horde buildings still following this horrendous "Ten thousand iron spike" idea?
Garrosh didn't invent spikes, WC3 orc farm was spiky before it was cool. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/475069494377725952
But, not iron buildings, steel spikes, dried molten rooftops.. It was made with tents, wooden spikes... Tribal - not metallic.
Consider it the industrial revolution for the horde Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/475072337927086082

Warlords of Draenor Stats
Is Versatility not the best stat for fistweavers?
Not the best healing throughput stat; it doesn't double-dip. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474720353227259906

1/2 If an ability critically hits and procs MS, does MS do 30% of crit or 30% of normal hit dmg. Seems that crit is the only
The damage including crit or not of the initial hit has no impact of the damage of the multistrike hit. Separate damage roll Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/475043018374803456

How will haste effect our GCDs in WoD? With OP gone our quick filler at 1 sec will make us feel clunky =/
Haste reduces your GCD. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/475057905847517184

PvE
what gets me is, JP acquisition is TOO LOW pre nerf, wtf?
When is the last time either of you direct-queued NOT random for a Normal mode scenario? WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/474741856819879936

when i tried grinding JP for heirlooms, I gave up quickly because of high costs, and low JP rates.
How long ago was that? Nowadays you get 100 JP per individual dungeon boss. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/474744430990082048

is it me or doesn't the tentacle showing up mean its part of the old gods
The Twilight's Hammer cultists are deeply connected to the Old Gods, and they're the ones who occupy BFD. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/475294289896144896

Will revamped BFD/RFD/RFK have level 100 H/CM versions, or just their existing low-level ones?
Low-level only; just showing some love to a few dungeons that felt a bit dated. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/475295194964041728

PvP
With all the requests for skirmishes through the years you all better play the ever loving crap out of them now that they're in game. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475096853671718913

Thought you guys were looking to improve PvP participation. Making the sets identical feels really lazy.
I love how people throw the word "lazy" around without any insight into how hard people are working. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/474956963176919040

are we really going back to where the PvP gear is the same exact model as the PvE gear in WoD? If so why?
Armor sets have lost a lot of aspirational value at the high end. We want higher tier content to reward cooler looking gear. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/474957916726763520
So to clarify the tier 17 armor sets are also the season 16 PvP armor sets?
Yes, but Mythic looks better than Normal/Heroic and Elite looks better than normal conquest. Also, it's Warlords Season 1. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/474960380704223232

Any plan to add some missing old school pvp stuff? first cata set, boot belt bracers,LK pvp and MoP weapon?thx for answr
We'd like to, just a lot of other work that feels more important. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/474960784745709569

.since it's been a bit over a week, any news on how the free faction changed has been working so far?
My understanding is that there hasn't been any significant problems with the process. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475006866875899904

So because Mythic difficulty gets different models, PvP gets gimped with re-used PvE models now? Come on
By your logic, you could say because Elite gear gets different models, PvE gets gimped with re-used PvP models. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475006245020000256
PvP is not getting the short end of the stick. Higher skill/commitment is being further rewarded in PvP & PvE. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475008499684880384
Mythic difficulty AND Elite PvP gear gets different models. This is a really strange attitude you're coming from holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475006031387316224
I would rather see PvP get different models and Elite get a recolor of those models instead of PvE>PvP recolor.
that's what we have now and it's underwhelming. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475010905517076482
Better rewards for top players is awesome and i applaud it, but recolored PvE sets for 95%> of all PvPers is also underwhelming.
Calling them "recolored PvE sets" is a huge mis-characterization. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475013818091700225
I feel like this could use some clarification. Mythic and elite pvp use same model/different color or no?
different color holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475403857527201792

is Ashran playable in the alpha yet? If not will you let us know when it is? WTB Ashran blog!!!
It isn't ready for public testing yet...but we're about to do our largest internal test to date. Does that help? holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475012870564884480

I mean, do you plan to squish the entire thing more if necessary ?
We wanted to shrink base resilience down to 0% which meant inflating health pools more than originally expected. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475094603628949504

Is pvp power necessary with different pvp and pve ilvls?
Nope holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475318980195143680

when my pet kills a mob on its own, I don't get loot.. will this ever be changed? really annoying when soloing old stuff
Unlikely to change that; it'd expose exploits. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/475377463816491014
is that the same reason it happens with other "non active" sources; lightning shield, etc?
Yes. Damage that you can do with no input should not count for loot rights. Prevents afk farming. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/475384985990356992

World
Yes there are rare spawns, lots of them, more than ever before! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/475154934389039104
If they are common, can they be rare?
Levelup rares are meant to be encountered, endgame are more rare. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/475159584882298880
Currently in alpha once a rare is killed its respawn isnt rare to that character anymore. Is this what you meant by "encountered"?
Yep! You always get the reward the first time, no need to farm it for loot/XP plenty others to hunt, visually represented. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/475194836099031040
A lot of the alpha rares need their "no-tap" flag set, they should all operate like Timeless Isle rares. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/475199305528393728
