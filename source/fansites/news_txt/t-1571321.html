<br>
Hey again&#x2014;Chris Robinson here with a new Artcraft, and today we&#x2019;re showing off the female and male Troll models. We&#x2019;re wrapping up work on both of their models, and we thought it&#x2019;d be cool for you to see them side-by-side. Showing both genders together gives you a more cohesive visual story and a more complete picture of the Trolls&#x2019; character, who they are, and where they come from.<br>
<br>
One of the unique challenges for the Troll models were their tusks. In the character customization options, you have the ability to select from a number of tusk &#x201C;styles.&#x201D; While other race models (like the Tauren) have similar customization options, the additional modeling, texturing, and animation articulation of the Troll face&#x2014;and mouth especially&#x2014;made this a distinctive challenge. We actually had to model the Troll with a flat lower lip; then, for each facial customization option, we went in and posed their lips to naturally wrap around each tusk option.<br>
<br>
We hope you enjoyed this quick look at the male and female Trolls, and we&#x2019;ll see you in the next Artcraft!</div></div>
