Warcraft Movie - Box Office Update<br>
The Warcraft Movie has done fairly well internationally (http://deadline.com/2016/06/finding-dory-warcraft-china-conjuring-me-before-you-x-men-apocalypse-international-box-office-weekend-results-1201775198/), with some claiming it has done too well in China (http://chinafilminsider.com/china-box-office-warcraft-ticket-sales-come-scrutiny/):<br>
<br>
<br>
China is now up to $205M.<br>
The international total is $340M and worldwide total is $378.9M.<br>
The movie was #1 in China for 12 days<br>
There were claims of fraud on Chinese social media:<br>
<br>
82 of the top 100 grossing cinemas on Saturday belong to Wanda, far above the usual 40 that usually are on the list.<br>
One Chinese theater saw ticket sales increase 406% from Friday.<br>
Another Chinese theater had a very high number of average moviegoers per screen for being in a city that is flooded. <br>
Dalian Wanda claims that numbers were high due to the promotion that brought more people to the malls and the numbers are correct. <br>

Blue Tweets<br>
PvE<br>
So just to make sure I&apos;m reading this correctly - Arcway and Court of Stars are going to be Mythic-only from launch?<br>
Yep. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/742908523332304896))<br>
<br>
Some players don&apos;t have the skills for Mythic dungeons.<br>
Honestly if you have the skills for Heroic and 4 people to join you, Mythic is also for you. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/742912043301228544))<br>
Adding multiple levels of Mythic, only to make the first a brick wall, would defeat the purpose. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/742912464086405121))<br>
<br>
I mean WOD Mythic pre-mades gives me a bad taste for this.<br>
Understandable - efficiency-minded folks running familiar content for a completion reward can make for an unfriendly crowd. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/742950243243806722))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
with conquest being removed as a currency will players still receive the Conquest to Gold conversion at the end of this season<br>
Yes, you will still receive gold for conquest and honor at the end of this season. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/743223992090169344))<br>
<br>
Professions<br>
you heavily suggested to players how they should have their professions set up. I agree, for mains. For alts, it&apos;s not so simple<br>
Sorry it came across that way. Double-crafting is absolutely a viable path that offers some advantages. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/743571892716482560))<br>
Again, not to be rude, but just wanted to point out this is one of the many varied ways players choose to play. If you really<br>
But even if 2x-crafting has advantages, you should still have a bit of gatherer-envy; if not, gathering is probably undervalued. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/743572159964995586))<br>
<br>
<br>
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Do you think storyline conclusions should be raid-exclusive in a situation where raiding is hard?<br>
It never bothered me. Maybe the compromise should be some stories but not every story? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/742400094914285568))<br>
The conclusion to the Arthas story e.g. is a big deal, years in the making, so should be for all? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/742400303576711173))<br>
But also weird when an epic boss in a quest or dungeon feels weaker than a less well known raid boss. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/742400481939447808))<br>

Warcraft Twitch Badges<br>
Twitch had an event that allowed you to show an Alliance or Horde badge in chat (http://warcraftontwitch.tv/) around the time of the Warcraft movie release. We looked at the faction balance of these badges in chat on the Warcraft channel during the movie premiere and other top streamers during the week.<br>
<br>
Most chats had around 30-50% of people that talked with no badge and they were excluded from these results. <br>
