Announcement Regarding Recent MMO-Champion Account Deletions<br>
We have been receiving a number of support requests from users who have recently had their accounts deleted. As outlined in these articles (https://curseweb.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002804333-EEA-Data-Transfer-Notices-Detailed-Information), we are asking users in the European Economic Area (the EEA) for their consent to transfer their account(s) and corresponding data to Fandom. Recently, we deleted accounts and data for users who did not provide consent.<br>
<br>
In order to allow users to reclaim deleted accounts, we are building an account reclaim service (https://www.mmo-champion.com/accountRecovery.php) that will be co-managed by Curse Media and Twitch. As outlined here (https://curseweb.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002804333-EEA-Data-Transfer-Notices-Detailed-Information), Twitch will retain a copy of deleted data that can be used to re-create an MMOC account if a user chooses to provide consent. Don&apos;t worry - your usernames cannot be sniped during that interim period.<br>
<br>
We understand that losing access (even temporarily) to MMOC is frustrating. To minimize the impact of this transition for users in the EEA, we sent emails to MMOC users with an opt-in link and placed a modal on MMOC with an opt-in button. If you were running a browser or a browser extension that selectively blocks content on web pages (for example, ad blockers), it is possible that the MMOC opt-in modal was blocked.<br>

Patch 8.1.5 VO<br>
The initial Patch 8.1.5 PTR build (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8257-Patch-8-1-5-PTR-Build-28938) added Kul Tiran jokes, flirts, and lots of VO!<br>

Patch 8.1.5 PTR Installation Size<br>
We&#x2019;re actually testing some new improvements that allow the client to share the majority of game data between installs, so you don&#x2019;t need multiple copies of the entire game in order to test things on PTR.<br>
<br>
To use this, you&#x2019;ll need to be using the Beta version of the Battle.net app (Click the Blizzard logo in the upper left -&gt; Settings -&gt; Beta -&gt; &#x201C;Switch to Beta&#x201D;). Then, when you install the PTR, it&#x2019;ll only need to download about 2.5gb of data. Note that if you have the PTR already installed, you&#x2019;ll need to uninstall and reinstall it to use this new tech.<br>
<br>
Once it&#x2019;s installed correctly, you&#x2019;ll see a new folder called &#x201C;_ptr_&#x201D; under your World of Warcraft folder, which should be MUCH smaller than a completely separate install.<br>
<br>
<br>
Classic Development Q&amp;A<br>
The development is definitely moving along but it&#x2019;s a complicated process and I don&#x2019;t have any specific details to share at this point. We know you&#x2019;d like to have a Q&amp;A and a variety of things answered, but we&#x2019;d prefer to have concrete answers to give you guys or new information. I&#x2019;m personally very opposed to doing a Q&amp;A for the sake of doing it without saying anything new. For everyone&#x2019;s sake that&#x2019;s just the better choice when it comes to these types of things.<br>
