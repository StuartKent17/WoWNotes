Boubouille2011-09-24, 03:46 PMPatch 4.3 Spectral Gryphon and Wyvern Mounts
It looks like we even have a saturday news post this week, hurray! Along with the legendary dagger screenshot released yesterday, it seems that the official korean website  7%B8%EB%A6%AC%EA%B3%A0_%EB%8F%84%EC%A0%81-2011_09_23#blog released 2 extra screenshots of new spectral flying mounts. 

There's no information on where players will be able to get them but it wouldn't be surprising to see them as rewards of the new Darkmoon Faire or any of the new features introduced with Patch 4.3. Thanks to annoyingmoose for his forum post about these mounts
