When you head into a mine, take a light.<br>
<br>
There are a number of corrections to the text of tooltips in the latest test build, but the actual damage done by most of those abilities hasn&apos;t changed.<br>
<br>
The tooltips for Frost Strike, Death Strike, Festering Strike, Devastate, Blood Frenzy and Critical Mass were all corrected. The damage on these abilities has NOT changed.<br>
<br>
There are actual changes to Savage Defense, Swipe, Thrash, Cleansing Waters, Arcane Blast and Arcane Explosion in recent builds. <br>
