Boubouille2007-09-12, 05:31 AMBlizzard mega secret project: Hydra
The Inquirer http://theinquirer.net/?article=42255 published the codename of one of the game currently developed by Blizzard : Hydra. 
This is pretty much everything we know and it's actually 3 months old because Blizzplanet http://www.blizzplanet.com posted this information along with the codename of Starcraft 2 Medusa a few months ago, but quickly edited it out for some unknown reasons. 

Draeneis and Blood Elves PvP Mounts
Wrocas, a german community representative confirmed that Draenei and Blood Elves PvP mounts were planned. This could be released in the next patch, or in 2.3, the models have been here for ever actually, and I can even use the same picture as 3 months ago !
As far as I know it is planned to introduce PvP mounts for Draeneis and Blood Elves. However we don't know exactly when this will be implemented.

Lurky for US customers
Someone asked if it would be possible to get Lurky a white murloc pet given to European players who bought the CE of Burning Crusade but couldn't get their netherwhelp pet before a few weeks because of a problem. Short answer : no.
Some of the non-combat mini-pets we put into the game are fairly unique and we like to keep them that way. There are actually several of these pets that are unique to their respective region like China, Europe, or Korea. If we repeatedly gave them out to the same region or gave them to all regions just because they exist, they would lose their value for the players who already have one. 

Weâ€™ve given out several types of these pets in the past, some are easy to get while others are quite rare, and we plan to continue making new ones available to players.

Beams and LOS Mechanics
Drysc explains why beam spells warlock life drain and mana drain in this case still works out of LOS and a bit out of range.
Yes, that's how they're supposed to work. 

Generally when attacking you want to be at maximum range, that allows plenty of time between you and the target to get out as many casts as possible. Now for a straight up cast and fly spell, it's cast, it's on it's way, and that's it, it's going to hit. For the channeled spells I had actually never heard them called "rays" before today, we call the effect a "beam" usually you cast, and you hold, and that damage can be interrupted or broken. To allow some sort of leeway, some give so that at max range it isn't just instantly wasted all of the time which would happen, a lot, especially in PvE it's given a little extra room to grow and follow.

Monstrous Kaliri going into Evade mode
It seems that Kaliris from Skettis the big birds aggroing and dismounting you everytime you try to go here won't be as annoying as now once the 2.2 patch is released. It seems that Blizzard managed to fix the bug switching them to Evade mode everytime you try to do something. 
Q: Anyone else think the borderline invincible Kaliris are a little OP?
A: Stop blowing up their eggs. It's rude. fixed in 2.2

Pet loyalty mechanics
Mania's Arcania http://www.maniasarcania.com/2007/09/10/loyalty-gain-time-and-experience/ posted an article about pet loyalty for hunters and how it works. Basically it's a combination of XP gain and time to wait, and if you're looking more information you can read the article on their site http://www.maniasarcania.com/2007/09/10/loyalty-gain-time-and-experience/
