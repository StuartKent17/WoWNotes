Upcoming Azerite Armor Improvements<br>
Why does it even need to be based on your item history to begin with? Why can&apos;t it just be based on your general item level like every other world quest and emissary gear reward?<br>
That&apos;s what we mean by item history. It calculates your general item level (as you put it) based on all items you&apos;ve looted, including items you may no longer have. This way if you loot an item that&apos;s a few item levels higher than what you have equipped, then decide you don&apos;t want it and vendor or disenchant it, you&apos;re still seeing higher item level rewards from world quests, emissaries, etc.</div></div>
