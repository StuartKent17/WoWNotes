Blue Tweets
Art
If all feedback is considered does that mean my spam of troll male tweets & threads like this is read? http://t.co/0NdansqPkD
Yep, everything is read even if it's not possible to respond to it all. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/601799083959984130

PvE
What about legendary weapons in timewalking dungeons? May i use Shadowmourne in a LK timewalking dungeon?
Yes, you can. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601846823288840192

Are tier tokens going to drop from bosses the way they been for past few tiers, or vanila class based tiers?
Yes. Tokens are an uninteresting dungeon journal entry and do not drop in Personal loot, so we show the set items. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601847129871527936

How good is the chance of seeing our attuned stats guaranteed on tier gear similar to how primary stats change based on spec?
No plans for that at this time. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601848809816084480

if we use a Seal on the final dungeon boss would that give us an extra chance at 700 ilvl drop?
You have this chance on any boss and any bonus roll in Mythic dungeons. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601849753798725632

Any plans on making BRF/HM bosses do less damage and have less health, in patch 6.2, like we had in Mists of Pandaria Raids?
Yes, there will be a zone-wide debuff on Foundry/Highmaul enemies, like we did to Throne of Thunder in 5.4. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601852892731944961

Are Highmaul+BRF Mythic going Cross-Realm with 6.2 as well?
Yes. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601852503894790144

PvP
Not sure if you've noticed it, but CRZ turned Halaa into a 24/7 faction-based Gurubashi. Captures the spontaneity of world PvP.
Yep, noticed it the moment I got the Halaa currency garrison mission and went out there to try to finally buy my mount.... WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/601538058123608066

Are there going to be WoD s2 equivalents to Ashran gear?
The items that are comparable to ones that previously required Ashran rep are earned in a different way in season 17. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601849451892723712


Ghostcrawler Tweets
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Classes
What was your take on Wotlk Ret? personally I enjoyed it alot even if it was simple. Right now Ret feels torn in directions
I understand not everyone liked it, but our goal was to improve the class. Long term, rotations with mastery are more satisfying. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599575116134002690
MoP and WoD not so much. I feel like the fillers in cata judge, CS and exo had something uniqe to eachother.
Ideally a rotation should deliver both mastery and satisfaction. Not sure we ever matched the satisfaction of the Wrath design. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599975263921840128

Like it or not, you contributed to that with your glib attitude towards some classes, most notably Paladins.
I invested a great deal of energy in making paladins fun. I am quite sarcastic and that was often misinterpreted. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599976990066618369
The TO THR GROUND meme happened when I had to make a post on vacation to explain a nerf players weren't expecting. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599977385149079552
All the other teasing I did because players thought it was funny and memorable. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599977550769598465
Let's recall what paladins did in BC - they healed and maybe they tanked a boss or two, usually in dungeons. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599977843628486658
Paladins, druid and hunters swapped spots for most played, and paladins were definitely the most vocal, magnifying the issue. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599978094875648000
Maybe you weren't satisfied with our results, and I'm fine with that, but we were never glib about anyone's class. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599978306226638849

wow question, forgive me 8. You once said Pandas reduced faction diversity, What did you think of high elf for alliance?
What is more important: faction identity or more options for Alliance? OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/600373826501783552

When rotations are easy to execute it's unfair to make them competitive in performance with those that require more mastery. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599574604999331840
Holy Power was an attempt to have paladins manage a resource, not cooldowns, and mana felt like the wrong resource. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599574847996362755
I think it's also possible we went so far under my watch in preventing niche DPS that nobody felt special. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599590591291199490

Hybrid specs can have niches, but pure DPS should be more more than a niche.
Nobody notices if 2nd dude is only slightly above 3rd dude. Nobody talks about which phase if the hard one. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599594322997092354

Yeah the interplay between single-spec-per-role and multi-spec-per-role dps complicates things immensely.
Yeah, and I've said before that easy spec swapping helps the guys who can fill two roles a lot. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599593673777512448
This makes sense but then a rogue with more defined niches has to play multiple specs to be as effective.
The dream is that everyone has a chance to shine, but that leads to some constrained encounter design. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599595111777832960
"Hey guys, where is the Frost DK encounter in this 6 boss raid?" OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599595209219936256

Right. There is a difference between wanting BF rogues for a fight, and wanting BF rogues only for that fight. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599592757322063874
And it sounds like the current design is that it's okay for stacking in mythic raiding, which makes sense to me. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599592872996769792
What we wanted to avoid was the guild of friends where you tell a weekend WoW player that he needs to reroll DK etc. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599593062331908097


Wildstar - Free to Play in Fall 2015
After failing to grow or sustain subscribers http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4889-Solo-Rukhmar-Kills-Blue-Tweets-Latin-America-Price-Changes-Grommash-Cosplay, Wildstar is moving to a free to play model this fall. 


Existing players will get some nice cosmetic rewards http://www.wildstar-online.com/en/news/2015-05-28-player-appreciation-rewards/ and Loyalty Points. 
Loyalty points will be used to gain Loyalty ranks to earn special items and perks.
All current content is open to free players, but there may be paid content in the future.
Free players will have less character slots, costumer slots, bank slots, and a lower decor items limit.
Free players also have other restrictions on their account, such as limited Auction House and Commodities Exchange access, no priority access to customer support, no crafting or currency bonuses, no gathering bonus, no PTR access, no queue priority, no reputation bonus, no experience bonuses, and other restrictions. 
Signature players who pay for a subscription will not have any of those new restrictions. 
Free to play players can remove some of the restrictions with the Loyalty system.
A currency for the store will drop http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game/632/feature/9725/Guess-What-WildStar-is-Going-Free-to-Play.html/page/1 from mobs in game, so even free players can eventually purchase things from the store.
