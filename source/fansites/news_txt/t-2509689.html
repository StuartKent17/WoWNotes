Dungeons and Raids<br>
<br>
Azshara&#x2019;s Eternal Palace<br>
<br>
The Queen&#x2019;s Court<br>
<br>
Fixed an issue with Repeat Performance (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/304409-repeat-performance) where Ignore Pain triggered from Warriors&#x2019; Bastion of Might (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/287377-bastion-of-might) (Azerite Trait) was counted as a cast, causing them to be silenced if they used Ignore Pain after casting Avatar.<br>
<br>
Queen Azshara<br>
<br>
Overzealous Hulks should no longer be affected by snaring abilities or gain the Infuriated (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/300428-infuriated) buff from such abilities.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; note: Since Overzealous Hulks become immune upon the first expiration of a crowd-control ability, using a movement speed reduction effect on them was generally a trap, and sometimes unavoidable for players with uncontrollable snares tied to their rotational abilities.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Temple of Sethrallis<br>
<br>
Removed a Void Emissary near the pack of enemies by Galvazzt.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Quests<br>
<br>
Tauren players who completed their Heritage Armor quest line can now turn in &#x201C;Remembrance&#x201D; to Baine in Thunder Bluff.<br>
&quot;Show Me What You&apos;ve Got (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/48939-show-me-what-youve-got)&quot; is no longer required for the The Norwington Estate quest line in Tiragarde Sound.<br>
<br>
<br>
WoW Classic<br>
<br>
Fixed an issue where turning in the Head of Rend Blackhand for the quest &#x201C;For the Horde!&#x201D; was not granting the Warchief&apos;s Blessing buff to players in Orgrimmar.</div></div>
