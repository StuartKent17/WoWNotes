Patch 6.2.3 - Earning Valor<br>
Blizzard released some more details on the Valor coming in Patch 6.2.3 today. It looks like players will be able to earn up to 4875 Valor per week. <br>
We&#x2019;ve just updated our Patch 6.2.3 preview blog post with the following details:<br>
<br>
Upgrading an item costs 250 Valor for +5 item levels. Hellfire Citadel items, Dungeon loot, Baleful items, and crafted items can each be upgraded twice, costing a total of 500 Valor for +10 item levels. There is no hard weekly cap on Valor, but the sources of Valor are inherently not infinitely repeatable. Valor can be earned in the following ways: Mythic Dungeon (Valor awarded with dungeon completion, once per dungeon per week) &#x2013; 300 Valor Points Complete the weekly Event quest from Seer Kazal (Pet Battle Event excluded) &#x2013; 500 Valor Points Heroic Dungeon (complete your first random Heroic of the day) &#x2013; 100 Valor Points Raid Finder wing (once per week per wing) &#x2013; 150 Valor Points for Hellfire Citadel wings, 75 Valor Points for Highmaul and Blackrock Foundry wings<br>
<br>
If you have any further questions on this, feel free to ask them here.<br>
<br>
Please note: On the current PTR, Mythic Dungeons are awarding only 150 Valor Points. This will be fixed to the intended value of 300.<br>
<br>
Does this include the PvP events? So you win 10 skirmishes and get 500 CP and 500 VP?<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
Why is the Pet Battle event excluded, but not the PvP events?<br>
The Pet Battle challenge is excluded because it and pet battling are account-wide.<br>
<br>
A hard cap on earning Valor (or any currency) essentially sets a weekly benchmark, and falling short of that benchmark leaves you feeling like you&apos;ve left something on the table. If we artificially cap earning at 1000/week, then we&apos;re saying it takes ~8 weeks to fully upgrade your gear, assuming &quot;maximum&quot; effort each week. If you miss a week, then you&apos;re a week &quot;behind.&quot; If you&apos;re busy, or sick, or just don&apos;t feel like it, and you fall a bit short of the cap one week, then you are delaying completion by precisely that amount. The existence of the cap makes the whole thing feel more mandatory in a sense, with motivation level then plummeting the moment you hit that weekly cap. Despite all these reasons, sometimes we do need caps as a pacing mechanism, particularly early in an expansion or where the impact on player power is massive (e.g. buying Conquest gear in a new arena season).<br>
<br>
Without a cap, there&apos;s an inherent diminishing return curve at play. You can start off doing the most efficient and engaging activities first, until you&apos;ve exhausted those, leaving you with activities that are progressively less efficient and/or less suited to your playstyle preferences, combined with the fact that you also inherently are exhausting your free time as you go, with your remaining time presumably becoming more valuable as it dwindles. At some point, you generally hit a threshold where the reward for the next incremental activity no longer seems worth the time investment required, and you&apos;re done for the week. For many people, that threshold will be reached at lower than 1000 VP per week, and their experience is no different whether or not there&apos;s a cap. For others, that threshold will be reached at a point above 1000 VP, and the lack of a cap gives them the freedom to decide when they&apos;re done rather than having it dictated to them. Some will benefit from the fact that they&apos;re allowed to convert a weekend of free time into a bunch of Valor to make up for that week when they were busy or traveling, coming out even or ahead rather than being permanently &quot;behind&quot; due to a cap.<br>
<br>
(The particular nature of Valor upgrades also adds another element of diminishing returns - your first 2k Valor will likely go into your weapons and trinkets. After that, every additional point of Valor you earn is progressively less impactful as you work your way down from chest/helm, to gloves, to bracers.)<br>
<br>
In this case, we opted for the design that offers more freedom to select the sources of Valor that most suit your preferred playstyle, goals, and available time. If you&apos;re into Mythic dungeons, then Mythic dungeons are going to be by far the most lucrative source of Valor, and should let you cover your needs quickly. But for players who don&apos;t want to run Mythic dungeons, queued alternatives (such as Heroics and Raid Finder) allow for a way to still earn Valor.<br>
<br>
I understand the sense of obligation to maximize performance in a competitive raid environment, but the game asks competitive raiders to make those choices constantly: do you craft every upgrade at the first opportunity, use the best gems in items you might replace soon, use the best food or Augment Runes on every pull, keep running lower difficulties on the off-chance of a Warforged/socketed perfect drop that could be an upgrade, keep up with multiple specs or alts to allow you to optimize for specific encounters, and so forth? <br>
<br>
Virtually everyone draws a line somehow and compromises in most of these areas, making a judgment about the point at which further expense (whether of gold, or time, or effort) is no longer worth the benefit. This system presents another one of those choices. The need to &quot;save players from themselves&quot; is a familiar refrain - but past experience has shown that people are better at managing their schedules and gameplay choices than many of the comments in this thread would suggest.<br>
<br>
And what about people like me whos preferred playstyle is to do organized Raiding? Why did you ignore the one question that&apos;s plastered all over this thread: why does Normal/Heroic/Mythic HFC not reward Valor?<br>
The focus of the patch is on dungeon content. Raid Finder was included as a source to add a few more options for Group Finder queuing, and if getting a few well-geared tanks and healers to hop back into Raid Finder improves queues a bit for the core Raid Finder audience, that&apos;s not the worst thing in the world. But if you hate Raid Finder, there are literally thousands of Valor available weekly without setting foot in Raid Finder. <br>
<br>
Part of the point is to provide a reason to revisit content that you may not have had much reason to do in a while, rather than just providing an extra reward for continuing your existing routine.<br>

WoW Panel Q&amp;A: Your Questions Wanted!<br>
During BlizzCon 2015, we&#x2019;ll be hosting another World of Warcraft Q&amp;A panel on Saturday, November 7 where we&#x2019;ll be answering as many Legion questions as we can. This year we&#x2019;ll be not only collecting questions from those attending the show, but we also want to have questions from those of you who will be watching from home. To do this, we need your help and your questions. <br>
<br>
To submit your own question, simply post in this thread beginning today (Tuesday, October 20) through Thursday, October 22. We&#x2019;ll compile these questions and present them again shortly after for you to vote on the ones you most want answered. Once the voting has ended, we&#x2019;ll pull the top questions to present during the panel.<br>
<br>
Some things to consider when submitting a question:<br>
<br>
Please keep your question brief and to the point. These will need to fit on a large index card. With so many questions, we won&#x2019;t be able to ask them all, but we&#x2019;ll be doing the best we can. Make sure you&#x2019;re asking a question versus making a statement. Please make sure the question is Legion specific. We won&#x2019;t be asking general questions.<br>
<br>
Thank you to everyone who takes time to submit.<br>
