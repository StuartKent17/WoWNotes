The only interesting thing is the &quot;Opening ceremony&quot; which has 90% chances to be the announcement of the expansion. <br>
<br>
No further informations, doesn&apos;t really look like an uber internal leak but I guess it&apos;s better than nothing.<br>

It also seems that World of Warcraft demo stations will be available after the opening ceremony (what a surprise) for 13 hours, which should be enough to test ... you know what.</div></div>
