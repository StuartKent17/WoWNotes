Blue Tweets
Mythic+ Loot
Will we get higher than 905 gear in the weekly M+ cache on patch day if we complete a +15 the week leading up to the patch?
The new level of Mythic Keystone 11-15 rewards will become active the week that the Mythic difficulty of Tomb of Sargeras opens. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/873311109045866496

Do i have to do a +15 this Week so i get Higher ilvl loot from my Weekly Chest or will the Cap still be +10 for another week?
The M+ loot cap generally goes up when Mythic difficulty of the raid unlocks - that's how it worked for Nightmare and Nighthold. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/873239607340441600

Achievements
.why remove the FoS ''Unholy determination'' From the DK Class mount quest, for those who've done it? Thats a slap in the face.
Don't want folks to feel the need to check guides before doing quests lest they miss out on something permanently without knowing it. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/873240201350397952
The FoS had been deleted in 7.2.5 data weeks ago. "Missable" achievements in one-time content would set a dangerous precedent. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/873239864904372224


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
You were on the WoW team still when it was said that there is too many currencies and it needed to be reined in. Since your departure, WoW has just seen more and more currencies added. Your thoughts on why this might be the case from a design perspective?
Generally it happens because you want to encourage players to engage in lots of different forms of content. If you have say 3 currencies and 10 forms of content, then what probably happens is one of the currencies can be earned in many different ways and there is a risk players will gravitate towards the most efficient. Having different currencies also lets you offer rewards on different cadences say something with not much buying power that you reward frequently, versus something very powerful that you only offer once a week or less.

The instincts to offer different rewards for different things makes your life a little easier for the designers, and often benefits players as well. The main downside is the growing complexity of a system, which can be overwhelming for players to keep straight.

Caveat: I haven’t played WoW in over 3 years. Source https://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/159426782263/you-were-on-the-wow-team-still-when-it-was-said
