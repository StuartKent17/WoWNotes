Boubouille2010-03-15, 08:58 AMIs Patch 3.3.3 this week?
Nop. The latest PvP PTR testing was made on the current build and developers were still looking for a couple of very annoying bugs. If you add it to a few random bugs like people disconnecting from the game as soon as they enter water and a few other things, I would definitely say that we will have to wait at least one more week before we see the patch on live servers.


Patch 3.3.3 Pet - Lil'XT and Celestial Dragon
One of the latest 3.3.3 PTR build added a new pet to the game: Lil' XT  We don't know what the drop location is for the moment but the name is very similar to Lil' KT from the Blizzard Store and the description mentions "Action Figure", it might be another pet that players can get out of the game. But not necessarily

He looks pretty cute and has a couple of unique animations + its own voice!

Also, the Celestial Dragon 's model has been updated once again, it now uses the same armor as the Celestial Steed
