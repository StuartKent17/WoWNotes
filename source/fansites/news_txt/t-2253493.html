<br>
World of Warcraft esports is expanding into the fast-paced, highly competitive world of Mythic Keystone dungeons with the Mythic Dungeon Invitational. We&#x2019;re looking for the best of the best from around the world to battle it out for a share of $100,000.<br>
<br>
Great Expectations, Great Rewards<br>
We&#x2019;re looking for the best players in the world, but first you need to show us you have the right stuff to compete. Teams aspiring to battle on the global stage must first push themselves through a gauntlet of Mythic Keystone dungeons, taking on increasingly difficult Mythic Keystones and earning the best scores on the Proving Grounds.<br>
<br>
Top scoring contenders will be invited to join as one of 32 outstanding teams from around the world, competing for a share of the $100,000 prize pool&#x2014;and ultimately claiming bragging rights of the #1 spot. Once chosen, 8 teams from the Americas, 8 from Europe, 8 from China, and 8 from Asia-Pacific will be tapped to face the challenge, proving they have what it takes to go all the way to the finals.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Proving Grounds [July 25&#x2013;August 8]<br>
From July 25 to August 8 , teams aiming to secure an invitation to the top 32 will be challenged to push their way through Mythic Keystone dungeons to achieve their best scores. At the end of the two weeks, they&#x2019;ll need to submit their top score using this form (https://mythicdungeoninvitational.wufoo.com/forms/m154hh9q1s6vx23/). Note that any entries received prior to the end of the Proving Grounds period (August 8) will not be considered.<br>
<br>
Remember, to be truly competitive among the World of Warcraft elite, your team must master multiple dungeons. We&#x2019;ll be judging performance across the 5 dungeons in which the team achieves the highest Keystone Level during those two weeks.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Proving Grounds run from July 25&#x2013;August 8<br>
Players will need to run a string of Mythic Keystone dungeons, increasing their Keystones Levels as high as they can. Performance will be evaluated across the five dungeons in which the team achieves the highest Keystone Level during those two weeks.<br>
No sign-ups required: all players are welcome to form up a five-player group and compete during the Proving Grounds period.<br>
At the end of the two-week Proving Grounds period, players will need to submit their top score [see blog for link]<br>
Based on scores from the Proving Grounds period, 32 teams will be invited to the playoffs: eight each from the Americas, Europe, China, and Asia-Pacific.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Big Showdown<br>
Beginning in September, the invited contenders will compete in the Mythic Keystone Dungeon Invitational for their share of the prize pool. Each region&#x2019;s contenders will be a part of a single-day broadcast in which they will face a series of elimination rounds until just 2 are left standing to represent their region on the global stage.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Regional Playoffs will take place over two weekends, with each region having its own single-day broadcast streamed on the Warcraft Twitch channel:<br>
<br>
September 16: China<br>
September 17: Asia-Pacific<br>
September 23: Europe<br>
September 24: Americas<br>
<br>
In the head-to-head competition, teams will execute a dungeon speed run; the first to finish will be declared the winner. All Keystones and affixes will be determined by Blizzard at the start of the match.<br>
The top eight teams from the regions will face off in a single-elimination bracket, facing each opposing team in a best of three series, until just two are left standing to represent their region on the global stage.<br>
Global Bracket: The top eight teams from the Regional Playoffs will advance to the final weekend of competition taking place on September 30 and October 1.<br>
Teams will continue to compete in a head-to-head single elimination bracket, only this time the battles will be cross-region.<br>
The top eight teams will earn their share of the $100,000 (USD) prize pool, broken down as follows:<br>
<br>
1st &#x2013; $50,000<br>
2nd &#x2013; $20,000<br>
3rd &amp; 4th &#x2013; $10,000<br>
5th &#x2013; 8th &#x2013; $2,500<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rules of Engagement<br>
<br>
Keystone levels and affixes will be determined by Blizzard<br>
The first match of each series will take place in a dungeon pre-determined by Blizzard.<br>
Once the final 8 regional teams have been determined, they&#x2019;ll move on to a single-elimination bracket where they&#x2019;ll go head-to-head.<br>
