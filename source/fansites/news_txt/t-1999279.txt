Armory Stats - Proving Grounds
With the news that Proving Grounds will no longer be a requirement for Heroic Dungeons in Legion, we are taking one last look at the completion rate in Warlords. The data used today is a sample of characters from 1.9 million accounts. We also did this earlier in Warlords of Draenor, which you can see here  

You can see scoreboards on WoWProgress for DPS , Healing , and Tank  endless.

Blue Tweets
Classes
will gnome hunter be released before or after legions launch?
Gnome Hunters will be available on day-one of the #Legion pre-expansion patch.  WarcraftDevs 

Items
With Legion having alot of legendaries will we be able to transmog them. If not, can we atleast hide Helm/Cloak legendaries?
You will be able to transmog #Legion legendaries to other appearances and vice versa. WarcraftDevs 

Artifact Weapons
artifact trait cost seems to double after 12 ranks, ~575 to 1260 for rank 13? intended?
Yes; after 12 traits you are transitioning past the level-up experience. Around that time, you will accrue 1/2  WarcraftDevs 
Artifact Knowledge which will increase the rate at which you gain Artifact Power overall. 2/2 WarcraftDevs 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
There is a pervasive myth that making content hard will induce players to rise to the occasion. We find the opposite. 2013 OccupyGStreet 
Is it really a myth though? Maybe those rising aren't complaining, a silent majority? This btw is why people play Vanilla.
Our data suggested it was a myth. Note that "not everyone should be able to do this" is a fine answer too. OccupyGStreet 
How do you feel about it now? Was the data right? Did the myth have some truth?
I think "hard" is just a difference audience. You have to choose. But you can't make hard stuff intended for easy players. OccupyGStreet 
I love Dark Souls. But that's because it is targeted at gamers like me, not ALL gamers. OccupyGStreet 
hard is what people want. It's human psychological. You feel more accomplished when finishing something hard.
*If* you finish. If you quit because it's too hard or you don't want hard then the developer lost a player. OccupyGStreet 
if you don't want hard then why play. We are already wasting time on a game, why not make it rewarding?
There are a lot of easy games that are popular. I think that's fine. OccupyGStreet 
My caution for developers is decide who your audience is and don't try to be all things to all players. OccupyGStreet 

looking at that. I am wondering was cata bad move? Players seems more acceptance to this model rather than WOD simple pruning
It depends if your intended audience is engaged players who want more or returning / lapsed players who might be overwhelmed. OccupyGStreet
