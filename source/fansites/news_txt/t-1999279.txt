Armory Stats - Proving Grounds
With the news that Proving Grounds will no longer be a requirement for Heroic Dungeons in Legion, we are taking one last look at the completion rate in Warlords. The data used today is a sample of characters from 1.9 million accounts. We also did this earlier in Warlords of Draenor, which you can see here http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4794-Armory-Stats-Proving-Grounds-Blue-Posts-Blue-Tweets-Wildstar-Update. 

You can see scoreboards on WoWProgress for DPS http://www.wowprogress.com/char_statistics/field.pg_damage, Healing http://www.wowprogress.com/char_statistics/field.pg_healer, and Tank http://www.wowprogress.com/char_statistics/field.pg_tank endless.

Blue Tweets
Classes
will gnome hunter be released before or after legions launch?
Gnome Hunters will be available on day-one of the #Legion pre-expansion patch. https://t.co/uXUNZy12km WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/732348739734511617

Items
With Legion having alot of legendaries will we be able to transmog them. If not, can we atleast hide Helm/Cloak legendaries?
You will be able to transmog #Legion legendaries to other appearances and vice versa. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/732340400795459585

Artifact Weapons
artifact trait cost seems to double after 12 ranks, ~575 to 1260 for rank 13? intended?
Yes; after 12 traits you are transitioning past the level-up experience. Around that time, you will accrue 1/2 https://t.co/OsNZDGDyv3 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/732341043799035904
Artifact Knowledge which will increase the rate at which you gain Artifact Power overall. 2/2 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/732341270438252544


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
There is a pervasive myth that making content hard will induce players to rise to the occasion. We find the opposite. 2013 OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/340939865858396162
Is it really a myth though? Maybe those rising aren't complaining, a silent majority? This btw is why people play Vanilla.
Our data suggested it was a myth. Note that "not everyone should be able to do this" is a fine answer too. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724602889646141440
How do you feel about it now? Was the data right? Did the myth have some truth?
I think "hard" is just a difference audience. You have to choose. But you can't make hard stuff intended for easy players. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724605165777473537
I love Dark Souls. But that's because it is targeted at gamers like me, not ALL gamers. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724605311500210177
hard is what people want. It's human psychological. You feel more accomplished when finishing something hard.
*If* you finish. If you quit because it's too hard or you don't want hard then the developer lost a player. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724660389124825088
if you don't want hard then why play. We are already wasting time on a game, why not make it rewarding?
There are a lot of easy games that are popular. I think that's fine. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724703285542703104
My caution for developers is decide who your audience is and don't try to be all things to all players. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724703361291833344

looking at that. I am wondering was cata bad move? Players seems more acceptance to this model rather than WOD simple pruning
It depends if your intended audience is engaged players who want more or returning / lapsed players who might be overwhelmed. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724604383682424837
