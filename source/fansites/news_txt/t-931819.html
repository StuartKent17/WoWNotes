People are starting to get crazy on forums about a rumor started on a well known hacking/cheating site that we won&apos;t mention here, you all know which one it is anyway. <br>
<br>
The information started hitting a couple of news sites because, well, I guess any attention is good and double checking sources is hard (because you might want to do that considering what the original source is) but I&apos;d rather kill the rumor before people start being very annoying about it. <br>

Why would you believe me more than someone else? Good thing. Well, this document is a pretty obvious fake anyway (especially with stuff like &quot;neglected Shadow Priest class&quot; in official documents) and Blizzard just doesn&apos;t draft that kind of stuff 3 months before the event before they send it to the entire company. <br>
<br>
Btw, internal documents would never say &quot;Activision Blizzard&quot;, unless they&apos;re scheduled for public release. The address isn&apos;t even Blizzard&apos;s, it&apos;s the Activision Blizzard HQ. You don&apos;t send that kind of mail to two companies 3 months before the Blizzcon just for fun.<br>
<br>
I mean, seriously guys, Blizzard isn&apos;t stupid when it comes to leaks, they don&apos;t just take the risk of doing that stuff so early.</div></div>
