Introducing the latest World of Warcraft companion up for adoption in the online Pet Store (http://us.blizzard.com/store/browse.xml?f=c:5,c:33): the wild and noble Cenarion Hatchling! This little critter is the twin of the rare Hippogryph Hatchling pet players could randomly encounter in the first World of Warcraft Trading Card Game set, Heroes of Azeroth -- and he&apos;s emerged from the forests of Azeroth to lend a helping talon to some friends in need. For every Cenarion Hatchling purchased between now and July 31, 100% of the $10 USD adoption fee will be donated to the American Red Cross&apos;s Japan Earthquake and Pacific Tsunami (https://american.redcross.org/site/Donation2?idb=0&amp;5052.donation=form1&amp;df_id=5052) relief efforts. This support will enable the Red Cross to provide shelter, food, emotional support, and other assistance to victims of this disaster.<br>
