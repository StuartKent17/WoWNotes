Thanks to player reports and feedback, we’ve identified a bug affecting how XP was calculated for parties of 6 or more players.
We are rolling out a hotfix right now, to all realms, that should correct this. Going forward, XP awarded should be significantly lower for parties of 6 or more players.

Again, thank you very much for your feedback.


Barron's - Activision Stock Potential Price Increase
Reuters recently  cited a Barron's report that pointed to a potential stock price growth due the positive reception of World of Warcraft classic. Classic set a set a record for launch-day concurrent viewers on Twitch. 


Barron’s cited reports of hours-long wait times to log into the game, and quoted Blizzard Entertainment, a subsidiary of Activision, as saying World of Warcraft Classic set a record for launch-day concurrent viewers on Twitch, a platform which hosts live-streams of gamers playing which people can watch.

“The business model for World of Warcraft is highly profitable, with a subscription costing $15 a month. If World of Warcraft Classic drives a couple million new subscribers for a few quarters, it would boost the company’s earnings significantly,” Barron’s said.
