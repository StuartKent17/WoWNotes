<br>
More changes to the 2.2 version, add this to the fact that the voice chat went live, maybe we can finally expect a release.<br>
<br>
Professions<br>
Jewelcrafting<br>
A new recipe for Steady Talasite is now available from the Halaa vendors, at the cost of research tokens. This superior green gem grants resilience and stamina.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Blacksmithing<br>
Added a new recipe for Ragesteel Shoulders that drops from an unknown creature in Shadowmoon Valley.<br>
Reduced the number of pieces required to get the benefits of the Ragesteel set bonus. <br>

<br>
Engineering<br>
Reduced the cooldown on the engineer-made Parachute Cloak.<br>

Quests<br>
Banish the Demons now rewards either a Darkrune or a Fragmented Darkrune. Five fragmented Darkrunes can be combined to create a Darkrune.<br>
In the Bomb Them Again quest, the cooldown of the Skyguard bombs was decreased to 5 seconds (was 10).<br>

Black Temple<br>
Saber Lash tanks will no longer be knocked back by Sinister Beam or hit by Fatal Attraction, even if they dodge or parry the attack.<br>
Mother Shahraz will now pick a new beam to cast after every 3rd beam instead of after every 5th. This means she is much less likely to cast the same beam many times in a row.<br>
Fatal Attraction now deals 750 damage on the first tick, 1500 on the second, 2250 on the third, and 3000 on all subsequent ticks.<br>
Prismatic Shield is now more fun. Specifically, Mother Shahraz now takes bonus damage from one school when she is resistant to its opposite. Her resistances now change randomly every 15 seconds and are capped at 25%.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Caverns of Time- Battle of Mount Hyjal<br>
The health of Jaina and Thrall have been increased again from their temporarily lowered values. They should be able to absorb quite a bit more incidental damage during the event.<br>
Archimonde has received several adjustments and fixes to prevent some of the harder to counter combinations of his abilities. Archimonde&apos;s Soul Charge silence has been lowered in duration to 4 seconds, and the death of the Priest with Spirit of Redemption will no longer create two Soul Charges. The casting time of Archimonde&apos;s fear has been increased to 1.5 seconds, and he should now use his Fear ability on a much more consistent interval. Archimonde will also no longer cast Grip of the Legion on very far away targets.<br>
Archimonde will no longer cast Grip of the Legion on targets that have just been hit with Air Burst.<br>
