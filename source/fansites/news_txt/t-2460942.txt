We’re currently working on some targeted adjustments to three specs in PvP. We don’t have a precise time these will go live, but we’re estimating late today or perhaps tomorrow afternoon:

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Mistweaver
Surging Mist PvP Talent mana cost increased to 3.8% of base mana was 2% of base mana, and healing reduced by 20%.
Way of the Crane PvP Talent increases physical damage by 25% was 35%, and now heals for 150% of damage dealt was 200%.


 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Elemental
Earth Shock damage reduced by 10% when engaged in combat with enemy players.
Stormbringer increases Lightning Bolt damage by 115% when engaged in combat with enemy players was 125%.
Surge of Power can now cause up to an additional 2 Lightning Bolt overloads against enemy players was 3 additional overloads.


 Druid Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Balance
Celestial Alignment increases damage of your spells by 10% when engaged in combat with enemy players was 15%.
Incarnation: Chosen of Elune increases damage of your spells by 18% when engaged in combat with enemy players was 25%.
Shooting Stars now generates 2 Astral Power when engaged in combat with enemy players was 4 Astral Power.


Our goal is to get these adjustments made before the weekend, and when they go live, we’ll confirm here in this thread, on Warcraftdevs, and in the next updated to our Hotfixes blog post.
