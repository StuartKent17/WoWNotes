Boubouille2007-08-18, 04:25 AMNethaera answered a question about gear swapping in Arena, I don't know if this has been confirmed before but it's not like we've got tons of news to cover lately. 

Question
"Hey Neth, The feature to prevent gear-swapping in arenas is not slated to go live with the next content patch, right?"

Answer
Correct. It IS coming though. It's just not in the next patch.

The Leipzig Games Convention  featuring ... a Wrath of the Lich King trailer ! Yeah, remember the nice leak  If we're lucky enough maybe we'll get more informations about the expansion here, stay tuned.
