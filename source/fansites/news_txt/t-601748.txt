Boubouille2007-08-18, 04:25 AMNethaera answered a question about gear swapping in Arena, I don't know if this has been confirmed before but it's not like we've got tons of news to cover lately. 

Question
"Hey Neth, The feature to prevent gear-swapping in arenas is not slated to go live with the next content patch, right?"

Answer
Correct. It IS coming though. It's just not in the next patch.
