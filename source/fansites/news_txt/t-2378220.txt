The Lunar Festival Is Here! Join the Celebration Feb. 17– Mar. 3
Every year the druids of Moonglade hold a celebration of their city’s great triumph over an ancient evil. During the Lunar Festival, citizens of Azeroth have the opportunity to honor their elders by celebrating their sage wisdom, sharing in magnificent feasts…and of course, lighting fireworks.

The celebration has begun in Moonglade and your Lunar Festival Invitation  is waiting. Join in the fun by dressing up in your Lunar Festival finery, launching fireworks, and paying homage to the Elders throughout Azeroth.

When: February 17 – March 3

Where: Moonglade  with camps in Ironforge, Stormwind, Darnassus, Thunder Bluff, Orgrimmar, Undercity

Currency: Coin of Ancestry

The Lunar Festival is a time of celebration for the peoples of Azeroth. At the beginning of each year, elders of generations past manifest around the world to impart their wisdom upon all who listen. Should you encounter these venerable spirits in your travels and take the time to heed their wisdom, they may even pass along tokens of their gratitude — Coins of Ancestry, the lessons of a past age in physical form. Gather enough Coins of Ancestry and the Cenarion Circle will open their stores of celebratory garb, fireworks, trinkets, and recipes!

The Cenarion Circle has good cause to celebrate, for the Lunar Festival marks the return of many Ancients that fell in battles past: Goldrinn, Malorne, Aviana, and Cenarius himself. But this celebration is darkened by the eternal torment of one of their own — Omen, a wolf Ancient blessed by the moon goddess Elune, has risen from the depths of Moonglade’s lake. Though Omen was once as noble and proud as any Ancient, he was driven mad by the Burning Legion’s tainted magics during the War of the Ancients. Omen’s immortality means that he is forever cursed to return in his maddened state at the advent of each new year - and this year, he has grown further in power, a challenge for even heroes of level 90. Heroes must make haste to ease this tormented Ancient’s suffering, in the hopes that perhaps next year he will return with a clearer mind.

Seasonal Boss: Omen Returns!

The great wolf Omen  was once a hero of this world. An embodiment of strength and fortune, Omen fought beside the heroes of the War of the Ancients until he succumbed to demonic magics. Turning against his allies, he raged across Azeroth, leaving death and terror in his wake. Omen was finally defeated in Moonglade, and he now sleeps among the silt of Lake Elune'ara. But each year, at the beginning of the festival, he stirs...

Main Quest Line

The celebration begins with an introductory quest, The Lunar Festival. The Cenarion Circle has invited all denizens of Azeroth to take part in the celebration of the Lunar Festival. You can learn more about the event by meeting with the Lunar Festival Harbinger.

It wouldn’t be a celebration without fireworks. You’ll be asked to buy some Lunar Fireworks and Cluster Fireworks to launch and complete the quest, Lunar Fireworks 

Once you’ve proven your firework prowess, you’ll receive your Lunar Festival Invitation  to travel to Moonglade and speak with Valadar Starsong  in Nighthaven. With your invitation at hand, you’ll be able to travel quickly to Moonglade by using the greater moonlight throughout the holiday.

The Lunar Festival currently has 16 achievements and 1 meta-achievement.
