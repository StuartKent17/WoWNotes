Build a Panel - World Creation in World of Warcraft

The team likes the designers to have the freedom to explore the space that they are creating.
Kul Tiras has been in Warcraft lore from the beginning so the team knew it would be a hearty sea-faring culture from Gilneas.
Boralus

Creating cities in WoW is one of the hardest things that the world builders have to do in WoW.
Early versions of cities have red lines for roads and green spaces for buildings.
The second phase of creating a city has early renderings of buildings so that the design team can figure out how the player navigates the space.
Scale is also a huge part of this phase.
Hamburg, Germany and cities in France were looked at for inspiration for Boralus.
Boralus had many iterations as time went on.
Safe roads were added over time easy to navigate roads with no hostile mobs.


Underrot

Hulling out a road is the first step in creating a dungeon once you have the initial map.
Secondary textures and terrain detail come next.
Certain parts of the terrain lead you in the direction that you need to go.
Busy areas are often next to areas that are not busy to add contrast.
Underrot was supposed to be a zone originally, but it wasn't working out. Eventually they decided it worked better as a dungeon.

Arathi Basin Remastered

They are still using the engine from vanilla.
They wanted to keep the same feel of Arathi Basin, but just give it the face lift that it deserves.
View distance and opening the space was a big part of the remaster for Arathi Basin.


The team likes to add Easter eggs to zones when possible.
One Easter egg was a baby in a bird nest in a tree that the designer thought no one would find, but she checked Reddit and the players did!
Some art is purposeful to trick players into a certain direction, such as leaning trees or lighting.
Iteration is next. They want to make sure the zone is not monotonousness and feels right.
Sometimes they design and create a zone that they love, but when they start to navigate it they realize that they hate it.
A lot of times they design things that don't work in the moment, but will be saved for later expansions.
Suramar and the disguise mechanic was a little iffy when it was first pitched, but it worked out well.
Drustvar started off as a frozen wasteland inspired by "beyond the wall" in Game of Thrones.

Several months in the team decided it wasn't working and changed it to the creepy forest that it is today.
Originally there were only several witch camps on the outskirts, but eventually they incorporated more of that theme.

A Horde symbol was placed where Varian's tomb is during design as a joke, but was obviously removed before live.
Putting an oasis in the middle of Vol'dun was done to break up the monotony of the desert.
Small details are added as the final step.
Little props are time consuming, but they tell small stories that add to the environment.
Lighting can be used to highlight parts of the environment.
This expansion in particular emphasizes the teams working together to tell the story.
It is incredible being able to work on a game this long and learn from player feedback.
WoW doesn't feel like one game. It feels like each expansion is a way to tell a different story.
Amazing things are coming!
