<br>
<br>
Baa&#x2019;l and Uuna<br>
<br>
Head to 62, 22 in Frostfire Ridge and defeat Baa&apos;l after weakening him.<br>
You either need to have Uuna (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Uuna%27s_Doll) or someone with an upgraded Uuna needs to have the summon active nearby to weaken Baa&apos;l. <br>
Baa&apos;l can get into a bugged state where Unna won&apos;t be able to weaken him. Gastropod Shell (https://www.wowdb.com/items/98136-gastropod-shell) will reset him and fix this.<br>
This rewards Baa&apos;ls Darksign (https://www.wowdb.com/items/162578-baals-darksign)<br>
It isn&apos;t clear if this is the end of the secret or not.<br>
