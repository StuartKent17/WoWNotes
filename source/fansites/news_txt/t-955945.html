A teaser on the official Warcraft Facebook Page (http://www.facebook.com/Warcraft/posts/194142790650384) hints at two new types of NPCs coming in a future patch, most likely Patch 4.3: the Transmogrifier and Void Storage NPCs. <br>
<br>
&quot;Transmogrifier&quot; seems to hint at a way to change the appearance of something, the first thing coming to my mind is either a way to change the look of your items (it was experimented in the past with things such as Darkspear Overcloak (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75693/darkspear-overcloak/) but dropped later). I guess it could also be a way to change facial/body features on characters.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Void Storage&quot; is probably ... well, another kind of storage? Or a high-tech magic trash can. <br>
