<br>
Inside Warcraft III: Reforged Panel<br>
<br>
Classic games was started to preserve these iconic Blizzard games.<br>
It was a natural progression to move to Warcraft III after their work on Starcraft.<br>
It was hard to keep the remaster under wraps because of the updates that were happening to the original game.<br>
It is not unfair to say that the art of the original game does not hold up as well as the gameplay has. This is why the graphics are getting updated.<br>
They originally went with a more cartoony look for the new graphics, but it seemed too much like a lot of other games.<br>
The team looked to the Mists of Pandaria cinematic as a base for what orcs and humans should look like in Warcraft III: Reforged.<br>
The same engine is being used for Warcraft III: Reforged as the original game with some minor tweaks.<br>
The tools used to create the new art will also be available to the community with the world editor.<br>
The community is what has primarily kept this game alive and the team wants to give back for that.<br>
The team has learned a lot of lessons from other RTS games they have made and can use these lessons in Warcraft III: Reforged.<br>
The team wants the locations you know from World of Warcraft to be better showcased and look more like they do in WoW for this remaster.<br>
The team has been trying to roll out a lot of quality of life improvements for the current game to prepare for the remaster. This includes patching and lag issues.<br>
The team wanted to get rid of limitations that no longer pose an issue in modern gaming.<br>
Opening Port 6112 to play custom games will no longer be a thing!<br>
Warcraft III: Reforged will be added to the Battle.net Launcher.<br>
At the end of the day, this is an evolution of Warcraft III. The graphics that you see are actually being added on top of the existing engine.<br>
World of Warcraft&apos;s engine is based off of Warcraft III. The team took the changes and lessons that WoW has had with its engine and incorporated it into Warcraft III: Reforged.<br>
All of the animations and attack swings are from the original engine.<br>
The team doesn&apos;t want to break apart the original community and so are trying to keep the game anchored to the original.<br>
The team can add a lot more personality to the game with new infrastructure as long as the core gameplay stays the same.<br>
The artists are slightly constrained by the old game&apos;s animations.<br>
All of the maps created over the years on the original game need to be able to load up in Warcraft III: Reforged with the new art assets.<br>
The team wanted to lift up the lesser used heroes to reach the power of ones like the Demon Hunter.<br>
The team has communicated with competitive players all over to address the changes that have been made to the game.<br>
The team wants to continue to communicate with the community to build the game in a way that pleases players.<br>
They have taken modern gaming steps to get the game released faster.<br>
They have partnered and hired people from the community to make sure the game stays true to the original.<br>
The UI is decoupled to allow the map makers to customize the UI in a way that they could not in the past.<br>
The team wants to have as many created maps to work with the new editor from day 1 of release.<br>
If maps take advantage of bugs or are broken they will be addressed.<br>
They will release the tools that they use and guides on how to use them.<br>
The original graphics and audio will still be available and can be used on command if you desire.<br>
The original SD models and textures will also look much better.<br>
There will be functionality to merge your current account into Battle.net to keep your win records and achievements.<br>
The team doesn&apos;t want to tell you how to play the game. This is your game!<br>
The team wants to improve the join functionality. There is a possibility you will be able to que as a group of 2 and matched with 2 strangers for a 4 v 4.<br>
The focus right now is getting the existing game right, but there is potential for new stories and campaigns in the future.<br>
They moved Arthas&apos;s entrance to the Culling of Stratholme to the southern entrance to showcase the familiarity to the WoW dungeon version from Wrath of the Lich King.<br>
The community needs to work together to teach new players about the game.<br>
