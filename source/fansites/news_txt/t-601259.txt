Boubouille2007-05-07, 12:07 PMNew PTR Patch Tonight
According to this post , a new patch will be applied on the PTRs tonight, this is possibly the one that will boost the stats of 90% of the current epic items including armor sets, so ... stay tuned.


Cauldrons informations
Cauldrons will be added in the 2.1.0 as new alchemy recipes, they're a bit like Soul wells created by warlocks but instead of giving you health stones, they will give you major resistance potions. I'd also like to point out the fact that the new resistance potions have a 2 minutes effect instead of the 1 hour timer on the old ones. 
And before you ask, nop, no Holy cauldrons. ^^
