Patch 7.2 - Shake Up the Battlegrounds with PvP Brawls
With the release of patch 7.2: The Tomb of Sargeras, you can experience some of your favorite player-vs-player Battlegrounds with a little extra twist.

Every other week a new PvP Brawl will be available to players looking for something just a little different. Each Brawl will offer a variety of modes, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay, and you’ll find them in the Group Finder tool hotkey “I” in the Player vs. Player tab. Just like Random Battlegrounds, you’ll receive a reward for achieving victory. Here are just a few of the Brawls you can look forward to:

Gravity Lapse – Resource Race
Gravity getting you down? Step into the Eye of the Storm and be prepared for a whole new en-lighten-ing experience. Every minute, players on the battlefield will find themselves launched into the air, only to gently fall toward the ground once more in a perpetual aerial ballet as they try to accrue enough resources to take the win home for their team.


  

Tarren Mill vs. Southshore – Warfare
Originally introduced as a part of the World of Warcraft 10-Year Anniversary event, this Brawl harkens to the early days of WoW PvP with an epic battle between the two towns of Tarren Mill and Southshore. In this game of war, you’ll need to work as a team to deplete your foes’ resources to claim victory.


  

Warsong Scramble – Capture the Flag
Do you have a flag? Warsong Gulch has always been the scene of an epic Capture the Flag battle, but what happens when you can capture your enemy’s flag without your own at base? Find out when you step into this PvP Brawl! We’ve also added a few more power-ups to the field of battle to stir things up a bit. To win, your team will need to be the first to capture 5 flags.


  

As with Micro-Holidays, these PvP Brawls are just the beginning. We look forward to seeing which ones become your favorites!

FEEDBACK: Transmog Sets
Further misbehavior in this thread will not result in action against anybody's account, it will simply result in me not posting on the forums. While I would like to have as open of a discussion about things as possible with the community and keep you in the loop where applicable when we fix bugs that might not make the patch notes, it is hard for me to take that idea seriously when any specific topic that I try to discuss is constantly derailed. There are many things to talk about in the game at any given time. This is a thread for transmog sets. 

If you guys genuinely want communication with developers, spamming up a completely unrelated thread with your personal crusade issue is the wrong way to go about it. Official Forums
