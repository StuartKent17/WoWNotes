It turns out that The Hivemind (https://www.wowdb.com/items/156798-the-hivemind) was a placeholder, and didn&apos;t make it into the final game.<br>
The Hivemind mount was actually a placeholder during beta :) It&apos;s since been removed from data. The secret hunt is, however, far from over. Good luck!<br>
<br>
To clarify, that idea was super cool, but didn&apos;t make it into the shipping product. It might be seen again in the future.<br>
