Path of the Titans Trinkets - Secondary Effect Only Procs in Raids<br>
The secondary proc effects on the Path of the Titans trinkets coming with Antorus in Patch 7.3.2 will only work inside of the raid. Keep in mind:<br>
<br>
<br>
Aman&apos;Thul&apos;s Vision (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/154172-amanthuls-vision) drops from Argus and doesn&apos;t take one of your two legendary item slots.<br>
Pantheon&apos;s Blessing (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/155831-pantheons-blessing) will allow you to upgrade the epic trinkets to item level 1000 <br>
Pantheon&apos;s Blessing (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/155831-pantheons-blessing) drops from Argus on all difficulties.<br>
Your group needs four unique Path of the Titans trinket procs to be active at once to activate the secondary effect.<br>

Hey guys,<br>
<br>
A slightly different discussion here, but just popping in with a note that the secondary Equip effect on the Antorus trinkets that note &quot;When empowered by the Pantheon...&quot;, such as &apos;Aman&apos;Thul&apos;s Grandeur&apos; on Aman&apos;Thul&apos;s Vision (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/154172-amanthuls-vision) or &apos;Khaz&apos;goroth&apos;s Shaping&apos; on Khaz&apos;goroth&apos;s Courage (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/154176-khazgoroths-courage) will only function within the Antorus raid once it is live.<br>
<br>
Currently on the PTR this effect works outside of the raid, but its worthwhile to offer some clarification so there&apos;s no confusion once the raid itself is live.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions on this, let me know!<br>
<br>
So, we&apos;ll be able to equip a third legendary, but only if we raid in Argus?<br>
Yes. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1074668-3rd-legendary-equiped-but/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17616974063?page=1#13))<br>
<br>
Ah, wasn&apos;t aware all 6 were needed for the proc trigger. Thanks for clearing that up snarky pants.<br>
While it won&apos;t function in Mythic+ we did change the six requirement so you only need four unique buffs to trigger the Pantheon secondary proc inside Antorus. You can have any possible combination of the unique five to activate this additional proc. Aman&apos;Thul&apos;s Vision ignores the rule as a &quot;wildcard&quot; filling any gap that you might be missing from the other five.<br>
<br>
So for example you can have two Aman&apos;Thul&apos;s and two of the other uniques and it will trigger the Pantheon proc.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind we&apos;re still tweaking and making changes to the trinkets so please keep voicing your feedback about it <br>
<br>
I&apos;d like to point out that Aman&apos;Thuls does not function this way currently on the PTR, the only thing special is its starting ilevel. Only four Pantheon trinket procs of any kind need to overlap to trigger empowerment. I&apos;ve tested this multiple times, using various combinations as well as four of the same trinket.<br>
Currently all of the trinkets on PTR behave like Aman&apos;Thul&apos;s Vision does in the Pantheon proc but will be changed to be unique before it goes live, other than Aman&apos;Thul&apos;s which will stay as a wild card.<br>
<br>
Still as always subject to change but that&apos;s the current plan.<br>
<br>
Is Aman&apos;thul&apos;s intended to only have an Intellect proc as its secondary empowerment? Considering the value of any variant of Arcanocrystal to more than just Intellect classes, this seems like a massive oversight.<br>
That might be a tooltip issue either on the PTR or on your client side but it should change depending on whatever your primary stat is.<br>
<br>
As much as a Warrior might like to be smarter with that proc it just wouldn&apos;t exactly help.<br>
<br>
If you&apos;re getting the buff as Intellect please let us know so we can get that fixed! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1074666-amanthuls-vision-personal/) / Official Forums (https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759219142#post-13))<br>

Local Currency Update Coming to Canada, Japan, and New Zealand<br>
Later this year, we&#x2019;ll be changing pricing on Blizzard Battle.net&#xAE; from USD to local currency in Canada, Japan, and New Zealand. We&#x2019;re excited to introduce the change. It&#x2019;s a key step toward growing our service globally and making it easier for players in these regions to shop and manage their accounts with us. <br>
<br>
Once this change takes effect, local currency will be used for pricing across Battle.net and within all of Blizzard&#x2019;s game shops. The same goes for any Blizzard Balance that players in these regions have stored with us, which will convert over to their local currency. Existing recurring World of Warcraft&#xAE; subscriptions will not be affected and will continue using USD. However, any new or renewed subscriptions and pre-paid Game Time cards will be offered in their local currency.<br>
<br>
While we haven&#x2019;t finalized the exact date, the switch in these regions is currently slated to take effect before the end of this year. At that time, all product pricing and any stored Blizzard Balance will be converted from USD to the local currency based on the rate provided by one of the major exchanges. <br>
<br>
For players in New Zealand, pricing will be inclusive of Goods and Services Tax (GST).<br>
<br>
We want to make as many of our players as possible feel at home in the Blizzard ecosystem, regardless of where they&#x2019;re logging in from. We also want to make shopping with us seamless and easy. Switching to local currencies is a key step toward achieving this. Some of our customers will be able to avoid paying unnecessary transaction fees charged by banks and financial institutions. Furthermore, this change will also help us expand the types of payment we can accept, allowing us to add payment methods that we previously couldn&#x2019;t offer because of their restrictions on transacting in USD. <br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll provide an update for our players in Canada, Japan, and New Zealand once we formally make the switch to their local currencies. In the meantime, we&#x2019;ve put together a brief FAQ to provide you with more information on the coming changes.<br>
<br>
FAQ<br>
<br>
When are you switching to local currency in Canada, Japan, and New Zealand?<br>

<br>
What products will be affected by these changes?<br>
The conversion to local currencies will affect all product pricing across Blizzard Battle.net&#xAE; as well as all in-game shops and any stored Blizzard Balance.

<br>
What happens to my stored Blizzard Balance?<br>
On the date that we make the switch in your regions, your stored Blizzard Balance will convert over to local currency.<br>
<br>
What rate Is Blizzard using to convert USD to my local currency?<br>
We will use the conversion rate provided by one of the major exchanges on the day we make the transition. <br>
<br>
Why did you decide to switch from USD to local currency in my region?<br>
This is an important step for growing our service globally, making it easier for our players around the world to shop and manage their accounts with us. Some of our customers will be able to avoid paying unnecessary transaction fees charged by banks and financial institutions We&#x2019;re also able to accommodate more payment methods, adding ones we previously couldn&#x2019;t offer because they have restrictions on transacting in USD.<br>
<br>
What currencies does Blizzard Battle.net support?<br>
Currently, Blizzard Battle.net supports the following currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, RUB, CNY, KRW, TWD, ARS, CLP, BRL, MXN, AUD. We will soon introduce support for JPY, CAD, and NZD.<br>
<br>
Blizzard Battle.net is still using USD in my region. When will you switch to my local currency?<br>
We&#x2019;ll continually evaluate which new currencies to bring to Blizzard Battle.net, and we&#x2019;ll update our players accordingly.<br>
<br>
What if my Blizzard Battle.net account is registered in the wrong country and I want to switch to my local region and currency?<br>
