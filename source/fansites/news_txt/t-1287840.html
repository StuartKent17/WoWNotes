It&apos;s probably still a valid point, but don&apos;t compare a mitigation-geared DK to a haste-geared paladin. <br>
It is also the case that some tanks care a lot about their DPS and some just don&apos;t, even at the cutting-edge. That skews data. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321771823853363200))<br>

stop removing unique class abilities to just add X generic for all classes. Bring back mana burn<br>

Hunter Bloat:EotB not &quot;bloat-&quot; Rotational and combat bloat is the problem. Ex.rather have Widow Venom baked in like war/monks.<br>
While combat bloat is a bigger problem, anything that fills up action bars is a problem. Venom would be a (small) PvP buff. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322389324408709120))<br>

E.g., FB plus Flamestrike plus 3 GCDs of Blizzard weaker than 5x NT. FB strong enough, but fillers too weak so NT stays ahead.<br>
We were just talking about this. It&apos;s a fair point. We probably should have buffed the AEs when we buffed the bombs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321721168979709952))<br>

Holy Paladin T14 4pc bonus feels mandatory because its better than T15 heroic items please do something<br>
Still skeptical of this. Giving up all of those stats on the higher ilevel is a big cost. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322389723807088640))<br>
Thats the whole problem. You&apos;re trading 4t14 with stats, the t15 bonuses are absolute 0. The 4 t14 bonus is also fun...<br>
I think absolute 0 is probably an overstatement. What you&apos;re talking us into though is nerfing the t14 4 pc. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322435686533849088))<br>

I quote in 5.2 &quot;We nerfed Phantasm and Psyfiend we didn&#x2019;t want to hurt Mass Dispel or other utility that Shadow&quot; I&apos;m confused?<br>
We looked, and very few Shadow took the Glyph of Mass Dispel, so we didn&apos;t think the cast time would be that noticeable. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321669166513922048))<br>
I should clarify that I meant the glyph in PvE. We don&apos;t want to nerf PvE utility. We DO want to nerf PvP utility for Shadow. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321704368908935168))<br>
Have you considered giving mass dispel the colossal smash treatment? Pve/PvP versions<br>
We did, but it&apos;s more complicated than CS because we&apos;re generally okay with Disc / Holy Mass Dispel. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321715435403870210))<br>

is the ST nerf thanks to the DT Buff last patch? Was fun as a CP Generator, not as a wannabe autoattack spin-off.<br>
We didn&apos;t like it as a cheap CP generator. We wanted it to be for times when you couldn&apos;t be in melee. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321711555446177792))<br>

Curious as to decision on shammies and staves, would have liked Spiritbinding Spire from LFR as it goes well with Shammy T15?<br>
It&apos;s a tough one. We heard from shaman upset that we would give them a 2H weapon and not allow use of their shield. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321665996979048448))<br>
<br>
Based on feedback, we are going to revert the change and let shaman win caster staves (and maces) once again. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321792115040460800))<br>
So you will listen to feedback on staffs but completely ignore reasonable feedback to revert the totem change?<br>
Taking feedback isn&apos;t the same as doing whatever the community asks us to do. The design decisions are still ours to make. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322027908015194113))<br>

Is there any chance of re-vamping Unleash Elements, specifically for ele shamans? It&apos;s practically a useless spell.<br>

are you happy with the green fire boss? Its the best thing ever to happen in pve imo. Can you confirm it will not be nerfed?<br>
I can&apos;t promise it won&apos;t ever be, but it is self-nerfing as players get more gear. (Some players have done it very undergeared.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321316378894282754))<br>
<br>
Maelific G. and Haunt seem like they&apos;re too hard to design for pvp but they are perfect for pve. (Pt.2)<br>
Agreed. This is the heart of the problem. SB:SS also means individual dots can&apos;t do that much damage in PvE, which hurts PvP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/320261555537182721))<br>
But I should clarify that we generally like SB:SS in PvE. It&apos;s PvP where it hold Affliction back. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/320261656670261248))<br>

How many arena warriors w/o 2nd wind? If you just thought &quot;at what rating&quot;, cookie cutter.<br>
Might make sense to bake it in, but then warriors would not need a healing talent on top of that. Still evaluating solutions. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321436159119069184))<br>

Is it intended that Deep Wounds isn&apos;t benefitting from passive bonuses such as Seasoned solider and the SMF bonus?<br>
We like the DPS it is doing. If we made it benefit from other passives, we would lower the damage it does to compensate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321316505163821056))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
So Primordius now takes 75% less damage instead of 25% right? So what&apos;s about all those Guilds killed him with 25% less damage<br>
We had to make that change to fix a degenerate strategy. We also lowered his health to compensate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322029376097095681))<br>

why the nerfs to 10 man normal?<br>
We gather a tremendous amount of data on raid progression. Some encounters were tougher than intended or compared to 5.0. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322394457276289024))<br>
so how many weeks should it take a normal 10 man guild like mine to clear ToT normal? just wondering if we are behind or ahead<br>
Typically the most relevant variable is how many nights a week you raid. There&apos;s no right answer, but fewer nights = longer. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322436607321985024))<br>
<br>
it sucked re-learning a farm fight. I don&apos;t hate on LFR, but why not nerf the maze hard in LFR vs big changes in norm/Hero?<br>
It was confusing in N and H too. The maze should be the challenge not the graphics and the run backwards part was just dumb. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322392491334709248))<br>
<br>
I loved 4.3 - LFR DS to reg/heroic DS with my guild on 4 toons every week. now I only have one raiding 90, period.<br>
You are comparing an overly long final tier to a hopefully short mid-tier though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319166738057023488))<br>
<br>
Do you think anyone will do heroic scenarios without an LFG tool? You&apos;d spend more time finding a group than doing content.<br>
We can&apos;t make random matchmaking content too challenging. If you have to form a group, there is some incentive to make it work. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319916362673827840))<br>
But it&apos;s definitely an experiment. We&apos;ll see what the response is. More challenge for more reward / efficiency could be fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319916488301613056))<br>
<br>
Looking at the avalaible data, ToT seems to be a heavy ranged favored tier, only rogues can compete in single. Thoughs?<br>
Pretty happy with it overall. Having 2 dot fights early on skews perceptions a bit. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322439091121692675))<br>
<br>
What is your opinion on the amount of trash mobs in ToT? Most people I talk to (raid team/LFR) think that there is too much<br>
It&apos;s hard to get a good read on such feedback because players inherently argue for as little trash as possible. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318812750371487744))<br>
Yes players want less trash. I don&apos;t understand this anti player request mentality.<br>
Players ask for a lot that would make raiding easier or more convenient. That doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s good for the game. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319242203132211200))<br>
Inconvenience for the sake of inconvenience is also not good for the game.<br>
Similarly, bosses without trash in between don&apos;t feel like bosses and the raid doesn&apos;t feel epic. Pacing is important. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319243564808818689))<br>
Again, opinion stated as fact. &quot;Feel epic&quot; is subjective meaningless term that lets devs justify anything.<br>
&quot;Feel&quot; makes it an opinion, not a fact. And yes, our opinions are important because we develop the game. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321323232382828545))<br>
<br>
Pacing is important. ToT fails at good pacing. Why are you defending this?<br>
Because pacing is subjective and we&apos;re happy with it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319517834810109952))<br>
<br>
Pacing was much better in Ulduar, just saying. This instance is designed for LFR, norm/hard are addendums?<br>
We always design normal first. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319515615347998720))<br>
<br>
A lot of pulls you need to &quot;tip-toe&quot; compared to past raids where you AoE/burn. Ulduar still best.<br>
I find AE/burn more tedious than anything. I like to be making some decisions when I play, even on trash. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318820801853943808))<br>
<br>
What was wrong with HoF/ToES/MV trash? Why did you need 3-4x more?<br>
The raid occupies a lot of geographic space... which is something many players were requesting. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318814933057941504))<br>
<br>
I&apos;d like to get some clarification on the Secrets of the Empire drop. Is the drop chance shared between LFR and normal/heroic?<br>
Yes. You should not have to run LFR (for those drops) if you also run normal or heroic. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319241980309819393))<br>
