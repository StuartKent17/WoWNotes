Human Racials in PvP
Previously, what made EMfH and WotF such strong racial abilities is that in many cases you could simply replace the Medallion with a PvE trinket and you would have more damage as well as getting to retain some form of crowd control removal. With the change in 5.4 resulting in changes to PvP trinkets and item level caps, these racial bonuses are not as strong as they were in the past. 

PvE gear in instanced PvP has an item level cap, PvP gear has no item level cap. You get additional resilience from equipping a Medallion with another PvP trinket.

To take a quick theory-crafting quote from this blog created by Eldacar:

Eldacar:For those of you contemplating using a PVE trinket or two here are some facts to help you make your decision. The 2600 Resilience offered by the PVP trinket set bonus provides roughly 2.31% additional damage reduction from baseline, which is about 8.25% effective damage reduction after factoring in the value scaling. Furthermore the set bonus will always increase your effective health by 32.11% relative to displayed health, so if you are currently at baseline you would go from 357% EH to 389% EH.
In what situations do you feel that it's more beneficial to be using an additional damage trinket over the Medallion paired with another PvP trinket to benefit from the Human and Undead racials?

How can you possibly be trying to deny the superiority of PvE trinkets in the light of the past?
I'm not denying their strength in the past when you were trying to push for maximum damage. Going for a PvE trinket by sacrificing the Medallion and having WotF or EMfH was by far a good choice and it's the reason we made the changes in patch 5.4. Now when you trade the Medallion for a damage trinket you are losing out on 8.25% effective damage reduction which equates to approximately 32.11% increase in effective health.

Also what exactly are you talking about PvE gear cap in PvP? The way i understand it is that the cap will eventually rise to the same iLvL PvP gear is by default. so they are equal in terms of ILvL at that time. 
We have mentioned in the past that the item level ceiling for PvE gear will actually cap out at 512. PvP gear has an item level of 522 and is unaffected by the cap, this means that PvE gear actually misses out on 10 item levels compared to PvP gear.

You think that the survivability boost given by the trinket duo will suddenly make people who try to max damage in any ways possible to not try to max damage in any way possible? 
It's a trade-off now and more of a choice. In the past, while not necessary, it was better to have the second damage trinket; now it's a choice between damage and survivability rather than how it was in the past where you got damage and sacrificed very little.

I’m not saying that EMfH isn’t a strong racial, and the same goes for many of the racials that are available, but the changes which occurred in patch 5.4 have helped to deal with the popularity of choosing to remove the Medallion in favor of an extra damage trinket.

Character / Items
Might be a short term fix, but do you think making vanity items account bound might help a little with bag space concerns?
Would it be weird to get a lot of duplicate items from say quests the second or third time around? Source 

And invalidate 8 years of work and effort to improve your toon. Wasted. Why keep playing if all the work will be for nothing?
If you had not put in so much effort on your character then it might have taken and still will 9 sec instead of 6 sec. Source 
But if you just love seeing six digit numbers fly off your character, then yes, we would be nerfing that. Source 
having a new expansion overwrite your top teir raid gear with greens feels more like a waste than the number squish
Currently, the raiders just get to wait longer before having to swap out to new gear. Source 
The counter to that is it also sucks to go for a long time with no possible upgrades. Not sure what the compromise is for that. Source 
I don't see a problem. If you raided last exp, new one's lowest zones should feel easy.
Agreed. It gets to be a problem when a raider ignores all rewards up until the next raid. That starts to get old. Source 

Raid Finder
one more thing. One of the reasons LFR is toxic is bc its is easy. If it was hard, people would be forced to make it work.
That is a nice sentiment, but we found the reality is players just bail rather than trying to make random matchmaking work. Source 
With groups of friends or even organized pugs, we find that to be much less likely. Source 

PvE
Norushen enrage timer is a bit strict isn't it? For the third boss, i can understand later bosses but the third boss?
Usually when we see this on Norushen, it's folks not doing well on the solo component, not just failing to DPS the boss enough. Source
