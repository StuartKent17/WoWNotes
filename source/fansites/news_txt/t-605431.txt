WotLK - Inscription on PTR ?
Well, not really the whole inscription professions, but it looks like an inscription spell made it to the 2.4 Test servers : [spell=35043] ! Note that this is the rank 3 of the spell.

<a name="s3req"></a>Rating requirements will remain on Season 3 items
Rating requirements will probably remain on Season 3 items even after the beginning of Season 4, but they will be lowered.
Q: Will the ratings requirements be removed on the s3 weapons and shoulders next season?

A: No, and this is new information as far as I'm aware, but the ratings will remain, however they will likely be lowered. Previously we had stated that the ratings would only apply to the current season's items, but that's no longer the current thinking or plans. As it stands currently the rating requirements will remain, but they'll be lowered as the new season's items are introduced.


Arena tournament and team switching penalty
It looks like changing members of your team during the 2nd stage of the Arena Tournament will get you a 150 Team Rating penalty.
Right now on the TTR when you change members of a team the team rating is penalized 150 points. When the real Tournament Realm season starts this will only occur during the second stage of the arena season.


Lag on Tournament Test Realm
We can not put the vendors in instances because there is no instance server on the TTR. The hardware normally devoted to instances in normal realms is devoted to additional arena space for the Tournament Realms. As I've said before, the hardware and configuration for the arena realm is brand new. Please be patient while we work out the kinks.


Incoming changes on TTR
A few things are getting changed in TTR to make it more enjoyable for everyone.
Based on observation and player feedback we will be making some changes to the TTR starting areas to make the NPCs more accessible to everyone. These changes may not make it into the next 2.4 PTR build update but they should definitely be in the following one.

They're working on the changes right now, I haven't seen them so I really don't know what they're doing yet. And there is no intention of ever allowing world PVP on the Tournament Realms. These realms are for the single purpose of supporting the arena tournaments.
