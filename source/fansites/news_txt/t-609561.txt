Boubouille2008-07-08, 09:21 AMMore 2.4.3 testing on PTRs
It looks like we won't get the 2.4.3 patch today, according to a reply to a bug report from Hortus there is already another PTR build on the work and it's very unlikely we'll see the 2.4.3 deployed on live realms this week.

Thanks for the report Samdog, it looks like this is already fixed in the next PTR build, please let me know if it continues after the next patch.
