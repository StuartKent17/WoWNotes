Account Wide Achievements<br>
While we&#x2019;re still working out many of the details regarding account-wide achievement functionality, I want to clarify that we plan for the system to apply to all achievements -- not just those added in Mists of Pandaria. It&#x2019;s intended to be an overall change to the current achievement system.<br>
<br>
Our goal is to make it so that you feel like you only have to get an achievement once. We think the time and effort you put into achievements should be evident regardless of which character you&#x2019;re playing. The update will be implemented at the Battle.net level and, as such, would apply to all of the attached World of Warcraft licenses on the account.

Account Wide Achievements<br>
I want everyone to be a bit cautious about their expectations as of yet. We still have a lot of details to work out in regard to how this will all work. Once we have more specific information to share on it, we&apos;ll let you all know. I don&apos;t want anyone to get too far ahead on things until we can share more and explain any possible &quot;ifs&quot;, &quot;ands&quot;, and &quot;buts&quot; with you all should there be any put in place.

Please Welcome Nyorloth!<br>
In a break from tradition, I am not a member of the Community team; long have I gestated within the Story Development division of the Publishing Team, itself a division of Creative Development. My purposes here are myriad, but to mention a few:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Increase the transparency of how we develop stories within our games and ancillary fiction.<br>
Encourage more constructive discussions of the lore, so that we may better understand your likes/dislikes in order to shape our future projects.<br>
To serve as a scapegoat for when something happens in the lore that you don&#x2019;t like.<br>
<br>
<br>
My eye has glimpsed the forming of an Ask CDev on the horizon... perhaps, even, Soon&#x2122;! You would all do well to gather your questions now, in preparation for this momentous event.
