New Hero - Yrel<br>
Yrel (https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/heroes/yrel/#?skin=light-of-hope) is the newest hero in Heroes of the Storm! She is a warrior tank with abilities that require charging up for maximum effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
After traveling to an Alternate Draenor, the forces of Azeroth saved the acolyte Yrel from the Iron Horde. With their aid, she rose to the rank of Exarch and fought back the demonic invasion of her world. Now, she finds herself where time, space, and dimensions converge: the Nexus.<br>

<br>
Alterac Pass Map<br>
Alterac Pass (https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/battlegrounds/alterac-pass/) is an Alertac Valley inspired map, with Vanndar Stormpike (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Vanndar_Stormpike) and Drek&apos;Thar in place of the normal Cores at each base.<br>
<br>
<br>
The generals charge and whirlwind, but leash if you try to move too far, just like they do in AV. <br>
After leashing, the generals will begin to regenerate health. <br>
For each keep you destroy, the generals will lose some armor. <br>
Each team has prison camp objectives on the opposite faction&apos;s side of the map. <br>
You must channel to start the prisoner escape and then maintain control until they escape. A single click will stop the escape, so enemy players must be kept away from the camps.<br>
After the prisoner escapes, a Cavalry will be summoned in each lane.<br>
The cavalry will grant increased damage and movement speed to nearby allied heroes and minions. This bonus increases with each subsequent objective completion within a game. <br>
The map also has two Gnoll siege camps and two Ice Giant boss camps. <br>
The Gnolls have a cleave attack and stacking armor debuff to damaged targets.<br>
The Ice Giants are similar to the Grave Golems on Cursed Hollow, but have an Ice Shard ability that will damage and slow in an area. <br>
There are mud pits around the objective area, which have a stacking movement speed debuff that is applied while you stand in them.<br>
