Due to the issues affecting realm stability, the Battle for Wintergrasp has been temporarily disabled on all realms. We&#x2019;re actively working to resolve this issue and we&#x2019;ll provide an update as soon as it becomes available.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your continued patience. <br>

New Arena Matchmaking System<br>
With the release of patch 3.0.8 we have implemented a new matchmaking system for arenas that will improve the overall system and help ensure that players will be matched against others of equal skill. The new matchmaking system uses a rating that you cannot see, and is separate for each of the arena brackets.<br>
<br>
The rating changes at the end of each match are affected by this new system, and as it just came out, there may initially be some odd behavior in rating changes, but these will straighten out fairly quickly.<br>
<br>
We will monitor this new system and update it as needed to help provide the best experience possible in arena matches. <br>

GM Chat Window Change<br>
We mentionned this feature a few days ago, check the original news (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=33167.0) for more details. <br>
<br>
<br>

As part of our ongoing effort to provide the best service and security we possibly can, we have introduced a new Game Master Chat interface!<br>
<br>
Now, when a Game Master contacts you, a special notification will appear in the upper right-hand corner of your screen, just to the left of your standard Mini-Map and above your beneficial Buff bar. The appearance of this notification, known as a &#x201C;GM Chat Request,&#x201D; will signal a pending message from a member of our In-Game staff. To access this message, simply click on the GM Chat Request icon and a special chat window will open which will allow you to have a secure conversation with the Game Master in question.<br>
<br>
By default, this window will appear on the left side of your screen, just above the standard location of your primary chat window. This window may be moved around and even closed at will. If closed, the GM chat window may be re-opened at any time by clicking on the &#x201C;Open GM Chat Log&#x201D; button, accessed via the In-Game Knowledge Base (the big red &#x201C;?&#x201D; icon in navigation tray). With this, should a Game Master send another message after the GM chat window is closed the GM Chat Request icon will again appear in the upper right-hand corner of your screen.<br>
<br>
If you are unable to view the GM Chat Request icon or GM chat window, we highly recommend that you reset your User Interface (UI) and ensure that all active AddOns are up-to-date. For more information regarding the Reset UI process, please see the following: http://eu.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=19379&amp;searchQuery=addons&amp;pageNumber=1 (http://eu.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=19379&amp;searchQuery=addons&amp;pageNumber=1)<br>
<br>
With this new interface, it will be easier than ever to talk to one of our staff without the distractions of busy scrolling chat text, and with full confidence that you are indeed in a conversation with a member of our In-Game Support team.<br>
<br>
Should you possess any questions regarding this new feature, however, please do not hesitate to ask.<br>
<br>
Thank you! <br>

A few more undocumented changes from our users, if you spot any please report them in comments. <br>

Grobbulus clouds are smaller and do less damage. <br>
<br>
Achievements<br>
Gotta Go! - The actual time to complete this achievement has been changed from 2 minutes to 4 minutes as of patch 3.0.8. There is currently a bug though and the text in the achievement window still shows 2 minutes. This will be corrected in a future patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/14496619991-gotta-go.html))<br>
You Don&apos;t Have An Eternity (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1874) - Both normal and heroic version of the achievement have been changed to 6 minutes. (Up from 5) The encounter has been changed and made slightly harder, the achievement isn&apos;t necessarily easier to obtain. <br>
