Stoy2019-08-16, 06:33 PMNo New Heritage Armor in 8.2.5
Blizzard had stated in a previous Rise of Azshara interview that both the Worgen and Goblins would be receiving their heritage armor with their model updates. This has now been confirmed as not happening in 8.2.5.
Worgen & Goblin Heritage Armor?
I can confirm that 8.2.5 does not include any new Heritage Armor questlines.


Free T-Shirt Day Micro-Holiday
The Free T-Shirt Day https://ptr.wowdb.com/world-events/1053-free-t-shirt-day Micro-Holiday is now active for the day!


An NPC marked on your map with a rare mob icon wanders around either The Valley of Honor Orgrimmar or the Dwarven District Stormwind.
The NPC carries a t-shirt gun and periodically launches one. A t-shirt appears on the ground that becomes clickable https://ptr.wowdb.com/objects/310737-free-t-shirt.
Clicking the shirt gives you either:

A blue item called "Free T-Shirt" that visually removes the upper portions of your armor to expose the shirt you are wearing underneath. You can only use this item if you are wearing a shirt in the slot.
A variety of cosmetic shirts

You can also find NPCs around the world who will sell you t-shirts for free!
