Another 250,000 Beta Invites Are Heading Out - Wave 5<br>
Blizzard is still working hard to make everyone happy and sent another wave of 250,000 Beta Invites, bringing the total to 800,000 Annual Pass Invites since the initial wave of beta testing!<br>
<br>
A few moments ago, we initialized a new wave of 250,000 invitations to the Mists of Pandaria beta test. These are all invitations for World of Warcraft Annual Pass subscribers, and it should be a few hours before the e-mail notifications for all recipients have been sent.<br>
<br>
If you want to make absolutely sure that you got an invite, just check your games list in Battle.net Account Services.<br>
<br>
As always, thank you very much for your enthusiasm in helping test Mists of Pandaria. We really appreciate your feedback.</div></div>
