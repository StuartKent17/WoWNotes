Boubouille2009-10-13, 10:35 AMTier 10 Multi-Race HD Screenshots
Even if the models for all the classes aren't released yet I got a LOT of requests for multi-race screenshot of the existing tier 10 armor sets models. There isn't much to report today so I took the time to do it, hopefully we'll see a new PTR build tonight. 

Important: They're super-early PTR models and even if they shouldn't change too much the helms covering beards/tusks/ears might be different on PTR and live servers, be careful with that. That's why I don't usually do multi-race screenshots so early 

Also, the small error in the DK Male screenshot is obviously intended and here to check if you pay attention. *coughs*
