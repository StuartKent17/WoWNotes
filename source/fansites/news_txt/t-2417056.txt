chaud2018-08-01, 10:15 PMBug - Quest Log Being Wiped
Users are reporting that their quest log is being wiped when changing zones. A fix has gone out but it may take a little while to hit your realm.
I am not trying to diminish the impact of this issue at all, it is obviously a huge deal. Especially depending on the quest that was lost... Bugs are regrettable when they happen, and we do what we can to deal with the outcome. I don't want to make any promises on a resolution when I don't know what may be possible here.

As an update, a fix has been found and implemented and it is populating through the live realms now. It will take a little while to cycle through and update across all realms/shard but folks should stop losing their quests.

So the question is will quests be restored, including the status that the quest was in, or are we gonna have to start all over? lol
I don't know if that is possible, Kamarel, but that is certainly part of the discussion about this situation. For the most part you should be able to just pick the abandoned quests back up, but for those who had partially or fully completed the quest, there may not be a way to verify that progress to restore it. One step at a time, let's get the quests to stop abandoning upon zoning first.
