(I heard a lot of mails were sent again yesterday, they&apos;re fake and you will end up losing your account). There was a few changes to the item tooltips code on the site, if you can&apos;t see the tooltip on this : [item=35001] please report in comments (the icon is missing on purpose). Stay tuned for the 2.3.<br>

Patch Mirrors<br>
As usual, I downloaded the patch from the downloader and it should be fairly safe, but of course you should use Blizzard Downloader if you think it&apos;s safer.<br>

Caster meta-gem in 2.3<br>
The new caster metagem will increase the spell critical rating by 12 and the critical strike damage by 3%. Keep in mind that it still can change.<br>
<br>
Engineering flying mount upgradeable<br>
You will have to buy the normal flying mount before you can upgrade it to epic, and it will look great.<br>
You&apos;ll first have to create the non-epic, and then upgrade it to the epic version. I think we planned the mats to be around 500g in total once you complete the epic version, but I could be wrong on that. It&apos;s worth it though. I wish I had an engineer after getting to see it. Hands down, in my opinion, the best flying mount in the game.<br>

2.3 PTR Wars : A New Hope<br>
The 2.2.3 PTR is now closed, thank you all for participating. We will be preparing for the 2.3 PTR soon, an announcement will be made when it starts.<br>
<br>
Until then you should all delete your wowtest folder from within the World of Warcraft directory to assure that you have no problems with the new client.<br>
<br>
Something to replace the old Dalaran ?<br>
At least it shouldn&apos;t change too much, Kirin Tor is still in charge. (This was in a fairly humoristic post though, but it&apos;s not like it gives tons of information)<br>
The land that Dalaran currently resides on is still claimed by the Kirin Tor and they have announced that it is not for sale.<br>
<br>
No other zones revamped<br>
Dustwallow Marsh is the only one for the moment, I guess it will be enough to help with the leveling.<br>
Hrm, I believe there may have been mention of a few other zones we would like to look at polishing up, but for now we have no announced plans for future zone revisions outside of Dustwallow Marsh in 2.3.<br>
<br>
Gnomeregan on the list too<br>
Gnomeregan level range has been retuned too, but by now I think we all understood that they retuned every single Pre-BC dungeon.<br>
If by &quot;fix&quot; you mean refocusing the dungeon to fit a smaller level range like the example we gave for Shadowfang Keep, then yes, Gnomeregan is on the list too.<br>
