A lot of people still wonder how the dungeon Call to Arms works and I hopped on PTRs to check it out. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When the Call To Arms is active for a role, a gold circle will appear around the icon and Satchel of Exotic Mysteries (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69903/satchel-of-exotic-mysteries/) will be an extra reward.<br>
Satchel of Exotic Mysteries (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69903/satchel-of-exotic-mysteries/) is the bag containing the extra reward with a low chance of mount/pet and will be bound on account. (See Dungeon Finder Call to Arms - Clarification (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2245-Dungeon-Finder-Call-to-Arms-Clarification))<br>
Call to Arms for more than one role can be active at a time.<br>
If everything seems balanced, there isn&apos;t any Call to Arms. <br>

Rated Battlegrounds VS. The Blues<br>
It looks like the lack of blue posts lately is because the blues have been spending most of their time training in PvP! <br>
Greetings Once Again!<br>
<br>
I know a lot of you had fun a couple weeks back when we logged on to the PTRs and ran ZA &amp; ZG with you. Well, we&apos;re coming back! This time however rather than fighting alongside you we&apos;re going to be duking it out on the fields of honor, better known as Rated Battlegrounds!<br>
<br>
We&apos;re going to be online tomorrow, 4/12/2011, at 4:30pm PST.<br>
<br>
To participate you&apos;ll need to roll Horde characters (we flipped a coin) and form teams on the Broxigar PTR realm. The reason we&apos;re specifying a faction is because this is actually a big test of our experimental same-faction rated battlegrounds.<br>
<br>
Hope to see you online, I&apos;m sure this&apos;ll be a blast! <br>
<br>
