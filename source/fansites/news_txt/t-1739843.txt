Addon - Premade Filter
Today we are taking a look at the Premade Filter http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/premade-filter addon. This addon allows you to filter group finder results to just list the groups you are interested in. The author is responsive to feedback in the comments on the addon page http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/premade-filter#comments and also has a topic on the forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1672267-AddOn-Premade-Filter?highlight=premade+filter.

The addon description page has lots of details and the in game UI has some additional help, but here are some of the more helpful features:


Set your criteria and search for new groups in the background, with chat notifications.
Tooltips show the number of each class and their role in the group.
Require or exclude specific words in the title or description.
Filter by the number of each role already in the group.
Filter by item level requirement and voice chat. 
Filter by specific bosses being dead or alive.
Filter out realms from specific regions.

Blue Tweets
PvP
People can play RBG's at 2700+ without skype so I think 5v5 objective PvP would work solo/duo Queue if done right 
If I ever do an interview, ask me my views on solo queue rated and I'll share them with you. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575833336947478529

Heroes and WoW PvP
Masochist tweet of the night: Do you play WoW and Heroes of the Storm but you don't PvP in WoW? I'd love to hear why. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575496853396963328

because you can't balance WoW PvP worth anything, man. its no fun mongo training healers
As much as people want to blame balance and me many don't get to the point where they could form a proper opinion about it. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575501794484355072
He just did, but you just ignored it because you're more worried about answering soft-balls, like gear differences.
The people I'm talking about are the average WoW player, not someone who has poured hours into arena. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575504632824229888
It takes a long time playing a game to develop familiarity enough to say "I don't like the balance here." holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575504768493203456
I've played World of Warcraft since 2009, Holinka. I've been a competitive PVPer for 3 years. I think I understand.
Right, you have a lot of experience. He's asking the people who *aren't* experienced why they don't. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/575505295612514305
If you've been a competitive PvPer for 3 years, my original question was not directed at you. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575505032730316800
Yes, and perhaps the SAME ISSUES that we hate are the reason? It isn't FUN.
We get a lot of feedback from PvPers about PvP. That's awesome, and we continuously work to improve on those issues. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/575506685441142784
But we don't get as much feedback from people who *don't* PvP at all about why not. It's an interesting topic. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/575507075498950656
Should probably try acting on the feedback of the people who do PvP first. That would be progress already
We already have a process for that. It just doesn't involve twitter. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575507751599665152

I like in Heroes that I can change my character every game, in WoW if I want to PvP as another class I have to level/gear up fully
good feedback thanks holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575501429542023168

heroes is more balanced than wow pvp 
I know hardcore people will jump on this but I don't think it's the reason for the average player. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575498733405782016

respectively and imho it has to do with gear disparity. If you don't get in early, it's frustrating dying so quickly.
it's good feedback thanks holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575498945461358592

for me this season felt like a chore to gear up, the obligation to play if you wanna compete can be a drag!
So make it so you can compete without playing the game. Got it! Just kidding I know what you mean holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575500953341857793

cont...3 I can play multiple characters and not have to level them. 4 No PvE changes that affect PvP. 5 combat is faster
Good feedback thanks holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575502191663845377

in pvp, you expect to die. Pvers have a hard time dealing with the paradigm shift.
Understand that...but in this case, the PvP mindset is obviously not the problem, because they play Heroes. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575759515435450368


New World of Warcraft Short Story: Code of Rule
In the days before the Iron Horde invaded Azeroth and tightened its grip on all Draenor, Warchief Grommash Hellscream sought every advantage in his quest to conquer http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/savage-world/code-of-rule/page-1 the orcish world completely.

The ogres of Highmaul once ruled Nagrand—and they still exert control over land and sea from their capital. They are massive obstacles to orcish dominance; obstacles that Hellscream himself has a highly personal http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/savage-world/lords-of-war/ stake in removing.

Faced with the prospect of extinction before a growing Iron Horde, the Sorcerer King of the ogres, Imperator Mar’gok, plots to ensure Highmaul’s survival at any price. But what can Mar’gok offer those who so eagerly seek his people’s demise?
