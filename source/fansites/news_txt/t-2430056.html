Increasing Island Expedition Rewards<br>
Island Expedition bonus rewards (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7852-Island-Expeditions-Guide-Battle-for-Azeroth) will be increased in a hotfix.<br>
Thank you all for your feedback on Island Expeditions. We&#x2019;ve been monitoring the rate of rewards from Islands so far, and while we believe we hit the mark with the Azerite rewards, we&#x2019;re not happy with the drop rates for the various bonus rewards (such as transmog items, pets, quest starters, etc.)<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re currently working on a hotfix that will substantially increase the rate of these rewards. Once it&#x2019;s live, you should start to see more of these items dropping for you (and your group members) on future Island Expeditions. While we don&#x2019;t have a firm timeframe for this hotfix, we&#x2019;re hoping to push it out later today.<br>
<br>
Again, thank you for your constructive feedback, and we look forward to seeing you on more Island Expeditions!<br>
<br>
