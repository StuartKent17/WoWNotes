<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/important.png" title="Important" /> Overview - At the beginning of the encounter Garrosh calls Kor'kron Warbringers and Far Seers to assault the players alongside him. Siege Engineers periodically join the battle and try to activate the Kor'kron Iron Stars on the sides of the room. Killing a Siege Engineer will prevent him from activating his Iron Star, but an active Iron Star will also crush any Kor'kron orcs in its path. When Garrosh reaches 10% health remaining, he will draw upon the power of Y'Shaarj to heal himself, gaining new abilities and no longer calling orc soldiers to his aid. During this phase, Garrosh will periodically pull all players into the Realm of Y'Shaarj, where they must battle their way through Sha minions to reach Garrosh and interrupt his efforts to draw more power from the heart. Every 25 energy Garrosh is allowed to gain will empower one of his abilities. Upon being reduced to 10% health a second time, Garrosh will fully drain the Heart of Y'Shaarj, granting him 100 energy and empowering all his abilities until he is defeated.

Heroic Nazgrim's Execute: Where encounter design fails class design Guardian tanks .... Any fixes planned?
Yeah, changing the way it works. Long term, we want Guardian less focused on dodge more on AM. High armor and health are cool. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363740719384494084

How does vengeance diminishing returns determine which is the primary vengeance target and which targets get reduced?
The intent is any time you tank more than one thing, you get less per target. Still more Vengeance overall. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363737209951625218
"Let me tank all that" should never be a strategy because of mitigation or DPS increases. It should be to save non-tanks. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363737431662538752

Outside of armor and stamina, what else would a tank look for in an upgrade to increase survivability?
Haste makes a fine mitigation stat for paladins. It's not hard to imagine a role for crit and mastery is already tanky. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362451947866955779

Why not shift the majority of tank game play to active mitigation? Its far more fun and interesting that way to me at least.
There's a good chance we will post 5.4. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361173630878621697
What about the idea of active mana regeneration for healers? Stacking spirit is incredibly boring
How could you make it more interesting than say wanding with paladin Light, given that healers have a lot else on their minds? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362081312904982531

every melee has at least 1 slow and you gave rets a 2 sec duration of burden of guilt? is the only class with 2 sec slow
"The only class with" is usually a win in our minds, not a reason to change things. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363733004285251585

What's the reason for making things like Thistle Tea +100 energy on-use useless? IMO it adds flavor.
How many consumables do you want to be forced to juggle? Flasks, food, potions, health stones at the moment. Am I forgetting any? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363731677438148608

Keep up serpent sting. Signature on cooldown. Get focus with focus getter. Arcane shot as filler. Which hunter spec is this?
Keep up X. Use Y on CD. Fill with Z. Perhaps proc A. What spec am I? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363400180713787392
You are being overly vague when it is clear as day that hunters of all classes have the least variety in their specs by far.
Hunters need more differentiation in their rotations among specs, but so do rogues. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363419325446635520

I don't know why you think spriest is fine, but you really should consider taking a closer look at the spec. It has issues!!
Every single spec thinks it has major issues that we don't understand or refuse to address. I sympathize but it's a no win for us. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363403669917544450
Same issues Shadow, indeed priests as a whole, always had; mobility issues. All it would take would be Phantasm base
We think classes and specs having strengths and weaknesses is good for the game. Not everyone needs to be the same at mobility. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363411079512072192

so we aint gonna see Absorb getting a Overhaul with how broken it has been in this expansion?
Absorbs generally are fine. Holy paladin and Disc priest could just toss them out a little too efficiently. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361999442552954880

But isn't a lot of the ability bloat today due to CDs? Som rotational abilities, but a LOT of CDs, too.
Yeah. There isn't a need for 3+ CDs on many classes. There are many situational abilities too. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362078030534938625
I'll toss out 4 abilities. You guys can debate whether the game can live without them: Disarm, Fel Flame, Heal, Fear Ward. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362078703934640128

Did you like the idea of Festerblight rotation?
We have a love / hate relationship with dot snapshotting, but that is offset by so many DKs telling us it's a fun rotation. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362463922873311233

It can cause weird behavior, e.g. Fel Flame dot extension going from a bonus to a penalty. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363399103356469250

It's tough. We'd like for it to be a choice, but if websites say MM is 2% higher than SV/BM, a whole lot of players switch. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363738251216953345

If we're considering reducing button bloat for Hunters, can we talk about Widow Venom? Extremely clunky.
Agreed. The challenge with that one is we don't want it to be passively applied for hunters either. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361995089364529152
IMO talent applied via arcane shot or serpent sting. One all three roles share, or something. mite b cool
Serpent Sting is really easy to apply though, and spread for SV. As I said, we don't want it to be that easy for hunters. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362076419280486401

We're not convinced Fire is going to scale out of control. Beyond say 50% crit or so, the value starts to decrease. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362460821000949761
I'm finding it very hard to swallow this statement, and so does other DPSers who compete with mages. Elaborate?
Fire's DPS is a little high in ToT. We were worried they were going to scale much higher in SoO, but it may not happen. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362616356199346176
So we can adjust their damage without say crushing Critical Mass or the like, which mostly hurts less geared majority. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362616479432183808

With that being said then, how is arcane looking to fair against fire? I love the new RoP change, and what about frost?
Arcane is great for some fights, and perhaps surprisingly is much more popular in China than in NA / EU. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362463345359589377

What was the reasoning behind the nerf to Revival MW monk
Because it was instant, it was significantly better than Tranquility or Divine Hymn. It solved too many challenges easily. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363734174739341312

Do you think we spam heal HR and EF bubble the raid because we like it? There is no alternative, and 5.4 doesn't add any
It's just the hot proc'ing and constantly refreshing the absorb that made the EF healing style a no-brainer. We want options. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362459127131287552
Ideally you could use LoD when clumped and EF when you wanted more finesse and didn't mind targeting multiple people. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362458964216119296
I don't target,I mouseover. Explain me how the 5.4 changes are making that happen in any way.
Using LoD vs. EF minus bubbles don't feel any different to you? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362460290706706432
I just use LoD whenever 3hp or DP procs. No thought behind
Then that sounds like the hot on EF needs to be stronger. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362463572401455104

Why does devotion aura still only work on phys dmg, hpalas will be the only healer without raid cds on some fights in siege.
Because it's very good in other situations. Encounter designers often consider Devo Aura the one they need to balance around. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362462464417337344

And don't say jack of all trades. Every Holy Priest knows that has never ever worked.
You think it should be bubbling the whole raid with EF spam? That's what we're trying to avoid. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362371464323796992
For the last time, we AGREE that EF blanketing had to be removed in some way. However, we need a different NICHE in return.
Not all paladins agree. That's mainly who I'm talking to. I am glad you do though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362455509506326528
My view is that you'\re not changing our EF blanketing ways. You're just making us worse at it in 25
Then perhaps we haven't hit the sweet spot for SH and SS tuning and possibly LoD. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362461452247891969
If you take EF, we're kind of okay with that. If every Holy paladin still does, then I agree we haven't fixed the problem. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362461535274151937

jack of all trades is inevitable given 10m raiding now - every healer must be able to do 'everything'. Less specialty = less fun.
To a point, but a druid and monk use pretty different spells to heal. We can't say e.g. druid you will be a bad tank healer. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362459575707910144
It might be possible to bucketize the healers into a ST or AE healer and then dictate you need one of each. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362459810068828160
Not sure that design is superior though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362459844248207360

I guess the only way to put through to you the state of hpally is to say "We told you so" when they are bottom of every fight.
If by bottom you mean HPS, isn't the EF nerf like < 5% HPS? Doesn't sound very harsh. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362073100080250880
EF nerf is way bigger than 5%. Seriously, would you have even had it on your radar if it was that little?
So what am I missing? How is it way bigger than 5%? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362367412600971264
And we lose more than 5%. Hpallies lose their playstyle. And "new" playstyle with SH is not fun for 95% of community
Not sure you can speak for 95% of the community, but if around 30% chose SH, that would be just about ideal. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362458541782597632

I don't think they weren't fair,but taken like a direct % you forget that EF is spread and that it refreshes IH to 45 secs.
Yeah, EF spreading is cool and should be a strength of choosing that talent. It's just IH that makes it the only choice in 5.3. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362449863251726336

Last but not least, why are you still dodging the 5.4 Pala niche question? U said you don't want us EF bubbling the raid...
I don't like niche questions in general because I feel like players try to use them to lawyer us too much. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362448969961439232
If I say druids are supposed to be the masters of hots, then folks drag that out whenever they cast a non-hot or someone else hots. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362449149842567170
Our intent is that specs have depth and nuance, and that doesn't compress nicely into 140 characters. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362449219656753152
But I think it is fair to say that nobody went into MoP thinking paladins were the masters of hot based absorbs and needed more. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362449344542146560
We just overbuffed Eternal Flame at the last minute before launch. Perhaps it even masked weaknesses in other areas. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362449469373022208

Let's say EF does 13% of your healing+absorbs. So the hot does 3-4% of total healing+absorbs. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362366214133125121
Even EF's refreshing the absorb is an important aspect, one that you keep forgetting.
No I think that's fair, though it's hard to quantify as part of the mythical "way bigger than 5%." Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362369706243522560
And SOI nerf was 10% of our total mana gained per fight, new DP "compensate" ~3-4%
But if you only count the healing say about 50% then EF's HoT was only 6-7% of total healing. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362366795644018690
This means absorbs are going to be reduced to 93-94% of what they currently are, or a loss of 6-7% of absorbs. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362367070706466818
If your absorbs are 50% of healing+absorbs, then you'll lose about 3% of your total throughput. BoL loss would be a little more. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362367367591895042
But it also leads to the whole "I can't function without EF" which isn't the design we want for paladins. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362369797377372160
I've said this a few times, but we never balanced paladin mana around 100% SoI uptime because we knew that wasn't realistic. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362371301115047936

Most of us Holy paladins are going to get the boot from our raiding guilds with all these damn nerfs!!!
Aside from EF which is small and SoI which we compensated for, which nerfs are you talking about? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362081933829750784
The talents are fairly competitive with one another, but overall we've lost a ton of strength from that tier
We buffed the finishers to help compensate for that and we can buff them more if needed. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362310039966461953
Tier 45 does not need to be the entire solution to making Holy Paladins work. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362310124796248067

what's the reasoning behind the Judgment mana increase? Are there other changes coming?
Paladins dropping all Spirit to use SH wasn't the intent. We'd rather it compete on utility / HPS grounds not super efficiency. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362075747650772993
But monks dropping all Spirit is fine? Even with 9k Spirit and old SH we could barely compete in 10s.
Monks don't do it if they choose the right talent. We don't think the mana or tools choice for paladins would be very fun. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362081692573368321

Biggest Ret AE problem is having to choose ST/AE Talents/Glyphs OOC and be stuck with them the whole fight.
That's part of the intent though. If you have everything available precisely and only when you need it, there's no choice. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362075331399647233

"We're happy with Shadow" was a "Let them eat cake" moment for us, we'd like a better answer at the least 
We're considering fixing the double SW: D thing. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363403329373614081
No disrespect, but the double SW: D thing is barely a thing. We need damage output tuning, sp for ST.
We're fine with Shadow DPS. It's where it should be if you're not comparing yourself to mage and lock, which are too high. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363462609158144002
Sorry, Sir, but people don't compare to the middle in any sport. They compare to the #1 within their category.
That's fine, but if they compare themselves to outliers, they're not going to be happy with our response. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363739993421778944
For the "I like to link Raidbots" crowd, maybe always compare your DPS to the fourth on the chart? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363740125945004032

A little confused with something I just read. Did holy nova just get nerfed for 5.4? Why on earth? It was useless anyway.
We removed the meteor but put on a target cap. It's a glyph, not intended to be the power house of the rotation. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363736689111343104
Also not sure the glyph is the right call. I worry we caved beneath the "I must have destealth!" crowd. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363736835429629955
Can Shadow get something to cast while moving? We can't Pain because it wipes our DoTs. Fel Flame if you are feeling lazy?
We don't want to add a new spell at this stage, but we would like to solve the problem. This is one of those hate snapshot deals. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363465364446785536
SoO does have a lot of multidot fights though and we can make sure Shadow is up there with Affliction and Balance on multidot. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363467101127704577
And multidot in turn has a better chance of being able to use SW:P while moving, because there's a non-snapshotted target. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363467230878515201
Some one already suggested getting mindspike back up to something usefull, idea?
For example, Mind Spike with no dot removal > Mind Flay if I'm not mistaken. There's also the talent. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363735793832960000

Do you have any plans to fix the latency on Shadow Word: Death's activation?
There is no easy way to do that since the game has to detect that the target is injured. Longer term it might be possible. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363730992122441729

Weekly News Recap
Another busy week full of news, so here is your chance to catch up! 


July 28

We looked at the Stormcrow mount http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3320-Patch-5-4-Stormcrow-Mount-Ghostcrawler-Interview-Blue-Posts-News-Recap.
Ghostcrawler did an interview:

Patch 5.4 is the final raid patch for Mists of Pandaria and ends with players defeating Garrosh and setting events in motion for a new warchief. Unfortunately, we will have to wait a little bit longer to see who that will be. 
WoW won't be going free to play anytime soon, as Blizzard is happy with the current business model. Even if they wanted to make it into a microtransaction based game, it couldn't be done with how gameplay works today. 
The devs want people to be able to catch up faster so that they can play with friends, which is why they are testing the experience buff http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/146939-enduring-elixir-of-wisdom and other convenience items in the Blizzard store. There is no desire to move towards a pay to win style game.


July 29

We looked at the new Timeless Isle armor http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3321-Ghostcrawler-Interview-Timeless-Isle-Armor-5-4-Notes-Update-Blue-Posts-TCG-Art coming in Patch 5.4. This will add a relatively easy to obtain set of item level 496 gear, and a set that you can grind for that is item level 535. Patch 5.4 normal difficulty gear has an item level of 553, while flex gear is 540, and raid finder gear is 528.
The Patch 5.4 PTR notes were updated with another round of class changes.
Ghostcrawler did another interview:

The item level squish http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2541-The-Great-Item-Squish-%28or-Not%29-of-Pandaria might take place next expansion. See tweet https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362307978944200705
The Lesser Charms that may be added to the Asian store are there as a convenience item for players that may not have time to do their daily quests that week or players who just want to save time. There are no plans to add items to the store that will increase player stats.


July 30

Ghostcrawler replied to some item level squish feedback http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3322-Item-Level-Squish-Kor-kron-Dark-Shaman-5-4-RPPM-Mechanics-Change-Blue-Posts-Art.
We looked at the Kor'kron Dark Shaman encounter http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3322-Item-Level-Squish-Kor-kron-Dark-Shaman-5-4-RPPM-Mechanics-Change-Blue-Posts-Art in Siege of Orgrimmar. 
Some changes to RPPM mechanics http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265372-change-to-rppm-mechanics/ were announced.

August 1

The Q2 Earnings call took place: 

Titan will not be a subscription based MMO. Blizzard is still working on a new direction and plan for the project.
The decline in subscribers in Q2 was more evenly split between Asia and the West.
The subscriber churn rate was very positively impacted by Patch 5.2 and 5.3.
Blizzard All-Stars is in wider internal testing and will be talked about more later this year.

There was a new PTR build http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3327-Q2-Earnings-Call-Patch-5-4-PTR-Build-17260:

Some new Bind on Account epic weapons http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-build=17260&filter-bind=10&filter-quality=16 were added, but the item levels aren't final.
The Throne of Thunder debuff http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/149070-shado-pan-onslaught#17247-17260 has been added.
Siege of Orgrimmar loot http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-build=17260 has been added, making for 100s of new items in this build. 


August 2

We looked at the Stormwind Harbor http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3328-SoO-Stormwind-Harbor-5-4-Notes-Update-RPPM-and-Haste-Changes-Blue-Posts-TCG-Art that is part of the Siege of Orgrimmar encounter.
