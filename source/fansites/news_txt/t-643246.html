Patch 3.1 on Live Servers this Week<br>
There isn&apos;t any official confirmation yet but the patch is now available on Blizzard download servers and it&apos;s only a matter of hours before we see a message from them. <br>
<br>
Raid Instance - Ulduar<br>
For millennia, Ulduar has remained undisturbed by mortals, far away from their concerns and their struggles. Yet since its recent discovery, many have wondered what the structure&apos;s original purpose may have been. Some thought it a city, built to herald the glory of its makers; some thought it a vault containing innumerable treasures, perhaps even relics of the mighty Titans themselves. Such speculations were wrong. Beyond Ulduar&apos;s gates lies no city, no treasure vault, no final answer to the Titan&apos;s mysteries. All that awaits those who dare set foot in Ulduar is a horror even the Titans could not, would not destroy, an evil they merely... contained.<br>
<br>
Beneath ancient Ulduar, the Old God of death lies, whispering.... Tread carefully, or its prison will become your tomb. <br>
<br>
The Patch 3.1 - Secrets of Ulduar (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/3p1/index.xml) official page is now available as well.<br>

Interface - Dual Spec / Dungeon Maps<br>

Argent Tournament<br>
The Argent Tournament is a new World Event located at the north of Icecrown. The Argent Crusade is setting up this tournament for everybody to test their skills against one another before joining forces to battle the Scourge. Gameplay-wise there are new daily quests to do along with mounted combat. You will gain ranks as you continue to do the daily quests and be able to become a champion of the city factions (Orgrimmar, Ironforge, etc.). At this champion rank you will gain a currency that allows you to purchase new items like the banners, non-combat pets, mounts, and gear.<br>
