Patch 7.3.5 Hotfixes - May 4
tems

Fixed a bug that allowed players to trade Personal Loot items that should not have been tradeable due to the character having no more-powerful item for that slot.

Developers’ note: This was an unintended change with Patch 7.3.5.



Quests

The Camouflage spell for the Redridge Mountains quest "Prisoners of War" should now function properly.

Mythic Dungeon Invitational - Americas and Asia-Pacific Group Stage May 5-6
The Mythic Dungeon Invitationals https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/esports/mythic begin in China this weekend!
We’ve chosen 32 teams who have pushed themselves to the limit and proven they are ready for their next challenge in the Mythic Dungeon Invitational. Eight teams from China, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and the Americas will compete over the span of four weekends to see who will make it to the top 8 before moving on to the Global Finals.

So, What's Next?
Each team will compete in Mythic Dungeons head-to-head in Mythic Keystone dungeons against teams from their own region during four regional stage events. Two teams will advance from each region during a double-elimination, best-of-three format tournament, trying to achieve the lowest time.

The competitors will need to balance speed, skill, and strategy to claim their victory over their opponents. They'll also need to exercise plenty of caution, as each character death will add 5 seconds to their time. Blizzard will determine the Keystone levels and affixes for the first match, but the losing team will have the opportunity to get the upper hand by selecting the next map and its crucial third affix. All competition will take place on special tournament realms, so all players will be competing on an even playing field.

Event Schedule
The competition all begins this weekend on Twitch Friday, April 13 when the top teams in China begin their bid to make it to the Global top 8.

Here’s the full schedule of events:

Weekend 4: Americas Group Stage Broadcast
Saturday, May 5 at 10:00 a.m. PDT
Sunday, May 6 at 10:00 a.m. PDT

Weekend 4: Asia-Pacific Upper, Lower, and Grand Finals
Saturday, May 5 at 6:00 p.m. PDT

Due to recurring issues during the Asia Pacific Regionals, the Upper Finals, Lower Finals, and Grand Finals will be held after the completion of the first day of the Americas Regional Group Stage on Saturday, May 5. You can read more on our forum post https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20763056108#1.

Where to Watch the Americas Regional Group Stage and the Asia-Pacific Upper Finals, Lower Finals, and Grand Finals
You can catch all the action in English on the official Warcraft Twitch https://www.twitch.tv/warcraft channel https://www.twitch.tv/warcraft.
