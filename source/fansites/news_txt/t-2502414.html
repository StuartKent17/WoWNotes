<br>
Patch 8.2 Hotfixes - August 9th, 2019<br>
Dungeons and Raids<br>
<br>
Azshara&#x2019;s Eternal Palace<br>
<br>
The Queen&#x2019;s Court<br>
<br>
Fixed a bug with Frenetic Charge (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/300550-frenetic-charge) which would cause Aspect of the Turtle (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/186265-aspect-of-the-turtle) to not correctly mitigate the damage and knockback effects.<br>
<br>
Za&#x2019;qul, Harbinger of Ny&#x2019;alotha<br>
<br>
Reverted a change that caused Mind Tether (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/295537-mind-tether) to deal excessive damage to the linked target.<br>
Corrected an issue where Mind Tether (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/295537-mind-tether) would not attach two targets that were in separate phases.<br>
<br>
<br>
Operation: Mechagon<br>
<br>
Fixed an issue that could cause players to become locked to the normal encounter if they killed King Mechagon on hard mode and died at the same time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Island Expeditions<br>
<br>
The bonus amount of Azerite granted to players with the Azerite Residue buff has been increased based on Island Expedition difficulty.<br>
<br>
Heroic Island Expeditions<br>
<br>
2 Azerite per stack of Azerite Residue, 500 Azerite total per player at full stack.<br>
<br>
Mythic Island Expeditions<br>
<br>
3 Azerite per stack of Azerite Residue, 750 Azerite total per player at full stack.<br>
<br>
PvP Island Expeditions<br>
<br>
4 Azerite per stack of Azerite Residue, 900 Azerite total per player at full stack.<br>
<br>
<br>
Azerite Residue increases in potency more quickly based on Island Expeditions difficulty.<br>
<br>
Heroic Island Expeditions<br>
<br>
Azerite Residue now increments every 1.5 seconds (6 minutes 15 seconds to reach full).<br>
<br>
Mythic Island Expeditions<br>
<br>
Azerite Residue now increments every 1.25 seconds (5 minutes 12 seconds to reach full).<br>
<br>
PvP Island Expeditions<br>
<br>
Azerite Residue now increments every 1 second (3 minutes 45 seconds to reach full).<br>
<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; note: As higher Island Expedition difficulties award larger total amounts of Azerite, we want to ensure that the reward for engaging and defeating the enemy team remains relevant, especially in PvP Islands.<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Fixed an issue that allowed certain abilities to remove the &quot;Recharging&quot; debuff from Logic Loops.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quests<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Taking the Air Out&#x201D; is now offered more often in Mechagon.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
World of Warcraft subscribers increased since mid-May, following the release date announcement and beta for World of Warcraft Classic and the Rise of Azshara update.<br>
Across Call of Duty, Candy Crush, Warcraft, Hearthstone, Overwatch, and Diablo, they are expanding their development teams and resources so that they can accelerate the delivery of content in the pipeline, pursue new business models, broaden communities, and delight players.<br>
Blizzard had 32 million MAUs (monthly active users).<br>
Hearthstone MAUs increased quarter to quarter following the release of the Rise of Shadows expansion and deeper, more engaging new single-player content in the quarter.<br>
Overwatch MAUs were relatively stable quarter to quarter, with engagement increasing following the release of the Workshop<br>
At Blizzard, daily time spent per player increased year over year.<br>
Overwatch League hours viewed continued to grow year over year in the two stages held during Q2<br>
<br>
Season to date, viewership and average minute audience have grown double digits year over year.<br>
<br>
Blizzard&apos;s Q2 net revenue was $384 million. Operating Income was $75 million (20% operating margin)<br>
<br>
Revenues and operating income declined Y/Y, reflecting lower in-game revenues<br>
Operating margin fell Y/Y, with the revenue decline partially offset by lower costs<br>
