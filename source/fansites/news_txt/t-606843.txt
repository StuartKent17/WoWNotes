Naxxramas in Wrath of the Lich King
A little more information has become available regarding Naxxramas in Wrath of the Lich King, which we would like to share with you:

Naxxramas is planned to be somewhat of an entry level raid dungeon in Wrath of the Lich King and not the hardest dungeon in the game, so things will be a little different from what they are now. One difference is that it will float its way back home to Northrend and will therefore no longer be found in the Eastern Kingdoms.

The developers like having content be more available to players and as such no final decisions in regards to attunement have been made, but the developers also like having special quest lines available to help players be more prepared to face raid dungeon content. It should be said that as an early raid dungeon, there isn't a big reason to block a lot of people from accessing it.

The challenges for hardcore players will remain though, because Naxxramas is a big dungeon that will not be easy to complete all the way through. The hardcore players can push into the higher content from there.

There is not yet much we can say to those of you who are already attuned to the current incarnation of Naxxramas. As mentioned above, things like attunement has yet to be fully decided, so it is still too soon to say if you will be required to go through attunement a second time, or if there are any plans to give titles based on the original Naxxramas attunement.

Those of you who wish to know if The Ashbringer will drop again will have to stay tuned for the next BlizzCast, where this will be mentioned briefly
Bornakk also answered a few more questions.
Will you get a title if you already completed the attunement quest for the old Naxxramas ? 
I have not heard of any plans for new titles based on the original Naxxramas. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5784277465&postId=59573399220&sid=1#49

Tier 3 Armors
We have already stated that we plan to re-use the armor models in the new version of Naxxramas as well so players will be able to get the look they wanted. For players who want the look and the stats of tier 3 armor at level 80, hopefully they are already farming the dungeon for them.

Atiesh
Regarding the Atiesh, I don't have any further details to provide. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5784277465&postId=59734616297&sid=1#113


Tauren Weapon Size Change Update
Changes to tauren weapon size will be reverted in 2.4.2.
The original intention of the Tauren weapon size change was to reduce weapon clipping with the ground when sheathed, but it was decided that the end result went beyond what was originally desired. After further review of the change and with feedback from the community as well as the development team, we will be reverting the change to the size of the Tauren weapons when sheathed. We will be making this change in the next upcoming patch and would like to thank the community for all of their constructive discussion on this matter.

New spells and talents in WotLK during beta testing
I'd like to lay out the caveat now that even when the new talents/spells/abilities are unveiled, things can and will most likely change over the course of the beta in order to balance things. I'm sure there will be plenty of people that feel x class or y class will be unbalanced based on new talents/spells/abilities, but like any expansion, it needs to be looked at within the context of the new range of gameplay that will be available... ie. 10 new levels, new gear, and new challenges.

New instances in WotLK
I don't have any new details to share regarding new dungeons in Wrath of the Lich King, but keep in mind that before The Burning Crusade there was a HUGE demand for more dungeons like Scarlet Monastery and we developed many areas based on this feedback.

Roleplaying in the next Blizzcast
In the next Blizzcast, one of the topics that will be talked about is roleplaying. It is not an excessive amount of information that will be unveiled as it is only one question that will be answered, but it talks about some things that should be of interest to roleplayers, such as our plans to continue developing things that are for roleplaying.

US Realms - Free character moves

We will be offering free character moves from selected high population realms to lower populated realms, assisting in population dispersal. The ability to move a character on the selected source realms will become available on Friday, April 18 at 12:00PM PDT, and are scheduled to run until Friday, April 25 at 12:00PM PDT.

This round of transfers will have multiple destinations available to provide more options for players looking to go to a lower population realm.

In the event that any of these realms meets our transfer goals before the scheduled end date, the transfers pertaining to that realm will be disabled. We highly recommend that if you are planning to transfer that you do so at your earliest convenience. No characters will be eligible for these free moves once the transfers have been closed.

Once the transfers open you can begin your transfer by visiting the Character Move page located here: https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html

The realms chosen consist of source realms with the highest sustained queues, and destination realms with the lowest population. The numbers gathered are directly from our data, and depict the realms in most need of these transfers. We will be continuing to monitor all realms and open additional free transfers in the future where necessary.

Source A PvP - Illidan, Mal'Ganis, Sargeras, Tichondrius, Warsong
Destination A PvP - Azshara, Maiev
