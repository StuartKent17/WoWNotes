Now that everyone has had a chance to check out the new art for druid cat and bear forms, we'd like to share with you the current break down of tauren skin tones and night elf hair colors associated with each form color. Please note that, while we have attempted to associate each form color as carefully as possible, this list is subject to change before the next major content patch goes live.

All options for skin tone tauren and hair color night elves are listed below followed by the forms that will be associated with each set of tones/colors. Listed in parentheses after each form color is the placement in which you'll find that form in the screen shots found here in our "Updated Druid Forms Coming Soon" preview: http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/druid-forms.html http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/druid-forms.html
