Due to popular demand (and a few shady back-alley deals in Stormwind&#x2019;s Old Town), the Alliance bike built for Azeroth Choppers will be rumbling its way to a vendor in Azeroth sometime after the launch of Warlords of Draenor. This mount will cost a pretty hefty sum of gold, however, so you might want to start saving up now if you want to ride around in style on this masterful machine. As a reminder, once the winning Horde Chopper is added to the game, it will be available for free to players who log in between now and September 30, 2014.<br>

Remember, only characters of the associated faction will be able to ride each bike, so buyer beware!</div></div>
