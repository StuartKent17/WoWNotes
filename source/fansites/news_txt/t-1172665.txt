Valor of the Ancients Buff
Mists of Pandaria is going to make it easier for you to earn Valor points  on your alts once your main character is capped for the week. The Valor of the Ancients  buff increases the Valor earned on all of your characters on a realm by 50%, after one character has capped for the week. This comes along with another change to Valor points that limits the amount you may hold at any time to 3,000 per character. 


    


Jaina Audio for Theramore Event
One of the recent beta patches added some more audio for Jaina during the Theramore event. If you haven't already listed to the previous audio, listen to it first ! See the long standing thread  about Jaina in the Mists of Pandaria forum if you are interested in more speculation and discussion of the lore!

Beta Class Balance Analysis
 Warlock Forums 
There is some major bug going on with Fel Flame and Corruption & UA. Tagging a target with Fel Flame seems to cause Corruption & UA to over double in damage.
Warlock DoTs are incorrectly increasing their damage. This is a bug, and will be fixed in the next build.

Could a blue poster please confirm/deny this bug, or if it's intended? It looks like the 50% extra damage DOTs aren't benefiting from Spell Power buffs. It says 50% of normal periodic damage in the tool tip, so if this is intended, it's a pretty hard nerf from the original MG effect.
This was the aforementioned bug with Fel Flame approximately doubling the damage of Corruption, which was unintended and doesn’t apply to the extra ticks granted by MG. For doing target dummy and theorycrafting testing, it’s probably best for you to not use Fel Flame as Affliction unfortunately, Demonology has no such way to avoid extending Corruption. This bug has nothing to do with spellpower. 

We understand that this bug is significantly skewing impressions of the Warlock specs, and hope to have a new build up to fix this soon.

 Hunter Forums 
Glaive Toss incurs a 1.5s global cooldown, unlike the 1s incurred by any other direct damage hunter ability. Is this intended?
I've noticed and fixed that yesterday, actually. Fixed for the next build.

 Shaman Forums 
So, if I am reading this correctly, on targets below 35% HP, each Chain Heal jump should have a 50% change to proc Earthliving, and each Healing Rain tick should have a 30% chance to proc Earthliving? Is this correct, or was the datamined change to Earhliving Weapon actually the removal of the 80% increased proc chance on Chain Heal and Healing Rain?
This is correct.

Is there any chance the developers could enlighten us as to Healing Rain's chance to proc Earthliving Weapon? It seems as though Chain Heal's is 0.2 x 0.25 = 0.05 i.e. the chance is reduced by the maximum number of targets. Healing Rain is 0.2 x ??? = ???. 

Either number will help me immensely! I am getting anywhere from 5.3 - 8% chance when testing it myself, and I just can't make these numbers reconcile with anything logical like "number of targets in the healing rain" or "number of targets at which the DR cap begins to apply". I'm interested in the proc chance when we are *above* 35% health. From there I can work out the rest. Thanks! 
Earthliving has a 20% base chance to proc, and an additional 80% additive, total of 100% if the target was below 35% HP when the triggering heal landed. After that, the chance is multiplied by 0.3 for Healing Rain, and 0.5 for Chain Heal. 

For example, a chain heal on a healthy target has a 10% chance to trigger Earthliving. A Healing Rain tick on a healthy target has a 6% chance to trigger Earthliving. 

 Mage Forums 
Here’s another bit of info I want to pass on sooner rather than waiting for a new build to get to you all, about Arcane Mages.

One of the defining characteristics of Arcane Mages has been that they can trade more mana for more damage, at a decreasing efficiency. In other words, they can play conservative, and use their mana as frugally as possible in order to maximize sustained damage. Or, they can play aggressively and increase their DPS now, in exchange for lower sustained damage over the course of the whole fight. 

Arcane’s sustained damage is about where we want it as well as Fire and Frost, barring some minor tweaks perhaps. But, they’re currently playing very high on their Arcane Blast stacks. The goal is to have their rotations change significantly based on which level 90 talent they pick. An Arcane Mage with Invocation should play very aggressively and frequently stop to recharge their batteries. An Arcane Mage with Rune of Power should generally play rather conservative, but stay at relatively high mana to maximize Mana Adept. And with Incanter’s Ward, an Arcane Mage should generally play the traditional mix of conserve/burn/evocate.

What we’re actually seeing are all three styles playing much more aggressively than we’re aiming for. There’s effectively a ceiling of just how much you can convert more mana into more damage. Invokers are playing so aggressively that they never drop their Arcane Charges at all, Rune users are staying at a 4 stack for a majority of the time, and Incanters are able to play more aggressively during their conserve phases and burn longer.

In order to try to solve this, we decided to try raising the ceiling. So, in the next beta build, you’ll find the max Arcane Charges has been raised from 4 to 6, and the damage increase per stack is back up to 25% from 20%. I’d like to emphasize that the goal of these changes are to create the gameplay flexibility that we’re hoping for there to be with Arcane, not to change Arcane’s overall DPS. There will likely need to be additional changes after this to readjust their damage back to where we want it. Feedback about how it feels, and theorycrafting analyzing the effects this has on them are especially appreciated.

 Death Knight Forums 
Also, a little tidbit for DKs who kept reading through all that Mage stuff: Blood Tap is back off the GCD in the next build. 

Doing LFR I realized that my bloodworms were doing about 35% of my healing done compared to live, where it does less than ~5%.. I was also competing against healers on healing done. I was averaging out to 40k HPS on the stone guards, compared to other healers who are just a bit higher. Is this intended?
Nope, it wasn't intended. Bloodworms were getting significantly more health and therefore healing from pet scaling than intended. For theorycrafters, they dropped from 25% to 6% of the Death Knight’s max health. 

Thanks for letting us know, this has been fixed for the next build.

If I purchase the MoP CE, will I get the mount and pet on all my accts, or just the one that's a CE? 
It applies to all licenses attached to your Battle.net account. 

So if you have 2 wow accts, you get the mount and pet on both? Even if you onky make one a CE? 
That's how it should work as long as they're all on the same Battle.net account. Twitter 


Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud 
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud  will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
Hard drive prices are slowly declining, but are still above the pre-flood prices, so now is still a good time to buy a SSD. The current SSD prices are still slowly moving downward , with most under $1 per gigabyte now. A few sales have even gone under 50 cents per gigabyte, so look for something on sale!

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 3770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions! If you are interested in Folding@home, take a look in our team's thread
