We recently made some changes to items that grant stealth detection. We felt these items provided a necessary advantage in competitive PVP and forced players to use lower level equipment even when more powerful items were available to them.<br>
<br>
This item can no longer be used in the Arena:<br>
Ultra-Spectropic Detection Goggles (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=23762)<br>
<br>
We have removed stealth detection from the following items:<br>
All epic engineering goggles<br>
<br>
We have reduced the stealth detection of the following items:<br>
Catseye Ultra Goggles (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=10501)<br>
Blood Guard&apos;s Dragonhide Gauntlets (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=16496)<br>
Marshal&apos;s Dragonhide Gauntlets (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=16448)<br>
Knight-Lieutenant&apos;s Dragonhide Gloves (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=16397)<br>
General&apos;s Dragonhide Gloves (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=16555)<br>
Bloodvine Lens (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=19998)<br>
Knight-Lieutenant&apos;s Dragonhide Grips (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=23280)<br>
Blood Guard&apos;s Dragonhide Grips (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22863)<br>
The Night Watchman (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31333)<br>
<br>

Blizzcon tickets on sale Saturday 16th<br>
Just to elaborate, we don&apos;t have an exact time on when they will be up but our web engineers will need to be here to properly start and monitor the system when it goes live so we don&apos;t plan to be doing that in the middle of the night.

Free Character Moves<br>
There were a lot of issues with realms queuing a little while back, especially at the launch of Wrath of the Lich King, so Free Character Moves were constantly available to players. Overall the queues are not a big issue right now so we have no had many FCMs lately and generally it takes some really nasty conditions like being stuck in a login queue for over an hour to really convince people to transfer to a new realm.<br>
<br>
We are keeping an eye on things though and working on improving things as always. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17162146657-any-new-free-xfers-planned.html))<br>

More than 2 Professions at the same time?<br>
We like the idea that players get to choose their professions and not just collect them all. This way players are picking the top 2 that they want or feel are best for their class and not just rampaging through everything for the sake of it. If we did allow players to have more than 2 professions then at the same time we would probably have to limit the perks you get through professions as it would be a big advantage for anybody who has more of them too.</div></div>
