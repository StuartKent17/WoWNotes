Zandalari Trolls and Kul Tiran Allied Races Won't Unlock Until Patch 8.1.5
If you missed the blue posts, PTR builds, and BlizzCon announcement, Blizzard once again reminded players that the two new Allied Races weren't being released today.
Iâ€™m curious if I can unlock it today or if I have to wait for the new raid to go to raid finder, anyone know for sure?
At BlizzCon we talked about these Allied Races coming in Patch 8.1.5. It might feel like a new patch day with the season update and raid opening up today, but this is still the continuation of the Tides of Vengeance story. We will have more information on the Zandalari and Kul Tiran soon!
