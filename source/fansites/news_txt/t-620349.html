Update 20:00 CEST - Just for fun ... Deathcharger&apos;s Reins (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/11675537865-deathchargers-reigns.html)<br>
<br>
WotLK World Event - Zombie Invasion<br>
There are many ways to get infected by the plague :<br>
Pick up one of the Suspicious Crate in Booty Bay, trying to loot one will instantly infect you.<br>
Stay in one of the poison cloud used by zombies<br>
Get damaged by a zombie.<br>
<br>
When you&apos;re infected, you can either run to a nearby Argent Healer or any player who can cure diseases to get it removed .... or you can turn into a zombie by :<br>
Waiting for the end of the timer (10 minutes)<br>
Getting killed by a zombie.<br>
Dueling another player and letting him kill you<br>
Using some of the existing &quot;immunity&quot; abilities like Stoneform, the paladin&apos;s bubble, or Ice Block for mages. <br>
<br>
After transorming into a zombie, you will only be able to using the following skills :<br>
Mangle! (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/october/wotlkworldevent_7.jpg) - Increases your next attack by 20 damage and reduces the target&apos;s armor by 3%.<br>
Retch! (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/october/wotlkworldevent_7.jpg) - Retch on the ground! Humanoids in it are slowed and infected. Zombies in it are healed.<br>
Lurch! (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/october/wotlkworldevent_7.jpg) - You and nearby zombies gain a temporary burst of speed, to help catch your food. Removes any move impairment or crowd control effect.<br>
Beckoning Groan (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/october/wotlkworldevent_7.jpg) - Beckon up to four zombies to you. They must not be in combat.<br>
Zombie Explosion! (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/october/wotlkworldevent_7.jpg) - Burst into pieces, destroying yourself but infecting those around you.<br>
<br>
As a zombie, your health will slowly decrease over time but it can easily be regenerated by hitting any living targets (beasts, humanoids, etc ...). Any damage dealt to these targets will heal you for a % of the damage. You can also use Retch! (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?spell=51230) on the ground and stay in the cloud to get some additional healing, these clouds are stackable and having multiple zombies stacking them at the same spot will let you regenerate your life in no time. <br>

A few blue posts were made about the event. <br>
Zombies + Durability Damage<br>
I just take off all my gear. Your gear stats will not help you as a zombie. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/11676469652-zombies--durability-damage.html))<br>
<br>
Zombies can talk to each other regardless of their faction<br>
Zombies are members of the Scourge and can communicate with one another. It makes you wonder where else in the world zombies will find friends. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/11676579493-cross-faction-chat-screenshot.html))<br>
<br>
Official FAQ (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/11693660644-zombie-infestation-survival-guide.html))<br>
Q: How do I become a zombie?<br>
A: Disease-infected crates are scattered throughout the cities of Azeroth, spreading a sickness that transforms its sufferers into zombies. And of course, when zombies attack, their victims can be afflicted by the disease as well.<br>
<br>
Q: How do you stop being a zombie?<br>
A: The disease can be cured by other players who can cast &#x2018;Cure Disease&#x2019; or by special healer NPCs in the cities. Once the disease has run its course and a character has become a zombie, the only cure is death.<br>
<br>
Q: Can I become a zombie again?<br>
A: Yes.<br>
<br>
Q: As a zombie, what are some things I can/cannot do?<br>
A: You can no longer cast the spells/abilities that you had as a normal character, and formerly friendly NPCs now consider you an enemy. You can, however, cast new, unique zombie spells.<br>
<br>
Q: Anything else I should know while being a zombie?<br>
A: As a zombie, you are part of a special faction that is friendly with all zombies and can converse with them, regardless of whether they were part of the Horde or Alliance in their mortal existences.<br>
<br>
Kisirani (World Designer) and Nethaera (Community Manager) also hinted at a few ... upcoming changes to the event. It wouldn&apos;t be surprising to see a LOT more things to happen in the next days, this is definitely just the beginning. <br>
It certainly does seem containable, doesn&apos;t it? (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/11676598984-youre-infected-and-dispeling.html))<br>
If only Arthas had just cleansed everyone versus killing them, right? Right? So easy! (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/11676598984-youre-infected-and-dispeling.html))<br>

21/10 Echoes of Doom Thus Far<br>
Following this week&#x2019;s maintenance, we&#x2019;ve gained much needed improvements through our tuning process. We&#x2019;ve seen overall improvements in stability with the realms, going through an iterative process to achieve better performance. Thus far, we have seen better results across a wide number of realms, and we hope players will experience much better game play as the process continues.<br>
<br>
For those European players who also read the US forum updates; the fix for the bug discovered after the US maintenance, and the additional improvements implemented in their rolling restarts today (their nighttime), were also included in the updates during the European maintenance. <br>
<br>
<br>
Blue posts<br>
Changes to Healing in the future<br>
We made an effort to improve the fun of tanking for LK, and so far it seems to have gone pretty well. Healing is next. In many ways it will be a more challenging fix because what people think is fun about healing varies and some people are pretty happy with it already.<br>
<br>
I also want to caution that it might be a massive change, so don&apos;t log in every day looking for the big healing hotfix. It could take awhile. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10043171787-healers-are-not-happy-constructive.html))<br>
<br>
Hallow&apos;s End - Squashling Pet dropping from Treat Bags<br>
I&apos;ll go ahead and put the speculation to rest by confirming that this change is indeed legitimate. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/11676578647-got-squashling-out-of-treat-bag-.html))<br>

Consequences of 10% armor increase on bosses for feral druids<br>
It will hurt Feral dps, but we also needed to hurt Feral dps a little. Cats with a cat spec really hurt stuff now.<br>
<br>
It will be a slight threat nerf to bears and warriors (and DKs and paladins slightly less) but tank threat is so enormous right now, that we don&apos;t think it will be a big deal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/11676467926-cats-and-the-10-more-armor-on-bosses.html))<br>
<br>
Moonkin form changes<br>
We changed Moonkin form so that only single target spells have a chance to regen your mana. This should really only affect the tactic of &quot;free&quot; Hurricanes that crit a lot -- Starfall is on a long enough cooldown that we don&apos;t think it&apos;s a significant source of mana.<br>
<br>
We like Hurricane critting and doing &quot;real&quot; AE damage and don&apos;t have a problem with it proc&apos;ing Omen of Clarity. The mana return on it was just a little silly though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/11296489266-question-about-hurricane.html))<br>
<br>
Omen<br>
Omen has always been hard to understand for some reason. All &quot;PPM&quot; means is that the chance is normalized based on cast time so that, for example, faster spells or weapon hits won&apos;t cause a proc to happen more often.<br>
<br>
Omen has a frequency of 3.5 sec. This means that on average it will go off every 3.5 sec on single-target attacks. For a group attack, like Hurricane, the chance is per target not per spell. However we also drop the chance slightly (I believe by a third or so) to make sure that area spells don&apos;t proc it a whole lot.

(Pet) Cat DPS reduction<br>
We took cat dps down a notch when we made the big pass on pet dps recently. It shouldn&apos;t be terrible, but it shouldn&apos;t be clearly above all of the others either. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/11296589426-cat-dps.html))<br>
<br>
Readiness off the GCD ?<br>
Bestial Wrath, if I&apos;m not mistaken, doesn&apos;t trigger a global but you can&apos;t interrupt a global to use it. Readiness does seem a little odd on the GCD (though it&apos;s only a 1 sec one). Abilities where you have to spend a global to get back others. We can discuss this one.

Retribution nerf and Divine Storm<br>
Homogenization is absolutely still a concern. We originally conceived of Divine Storm as Holy and obviously liked it in that role. We discussed several different ways to change it, but leaving it as Holy would have meant really lowering the damage, which might have turned into a greater PvE nerf than intended. (Physical damage is a good knob to turn for PvE because we can assume a boss is sundered, but we can&apos;t assume that in PvP.)<br>
<br>
I described what we wanted to do as surgical. We wanted to change as little as we could to get the changes we wanted. Switching the spell from Holy was a very easy change. Rebuilding the entire spell might have been prone to introduced bugs or side-effects, which would then prevent us from evaluating if the nerfs to Ret were sufficient.<br>
<br>
We plan on revisiting Divine Storm once we have a better idea of where level 80 dps and pvp stack up in general. I won&apos;t promise it will return to Holy damage, but it might. We might also try and do something different with it to help push it farther from Whirlwind.<br>
<br>
Nerfing a class is never fun, and I thank people who have remained rational about it. I know it can be an emotional issue given Ret&apos;s history. We still want to see the spec in PvP and endgame raids though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/5/11296588778-gc-303-hurt-rets-cool-factor.html))<br>
<br>
Holy spec AE Healing<br>
We have resisted giving Holy a true AE heal in order to reinforce differentiation among the healing classes. But if needing an AE turns out to be something that every healer needs, just like every tank need an AE, then we&apos;ll man up and give it to them. &quot;Deemed by the devs&quot; is key though. We&apos;re not going to do it just because the community asks for it. But we will at least listen to your logic.

Mandatory talents and potential changes to all trees<br>
What we would like to do with all of the trees is give you options where possible. Cookie-cutter builds may always be a reality in a game like this to some extent, but ideally you could get the core of what you need to be competitive (in dps, CC, healing or whatever) and have a few talent points left over for fun talents.<br>
<br>
Now I&apos;m being candid here, which is a little risky, because mean players tend to turn it into &quot;ZOMG they are shipping the game before it&apos;s perfect.&quot; But I think rational people realize that with a game the scope of WoW and a team as creative as ours, there are always more things you want to do. So there is the preamble. If this comes back to bite me, I&apos;ll just be less forthcoming with our thought process in the future. <br>
<br>
We do think there are parts of the priest tree that are too bloated, and we aren&apos;t 100% happy with some of the decisions you&apos;re forced to make. Getting Meditation is one. Another is trading off Imp DS or Guardian Spirit. This involves a major change to probably all three trees though, so it&apos;s probably not going to happen before LK goes live. We are trying to minimize sweeping changes right now, just to minimize introducing potential bugs into the game. But it&apos;s something you will probably start seeing before too long, perhaps in bits and pieces or perhaps not. A lot of that will be informed on how priests do in PvP and PvE once Lich King ships as well.

Spirit Walk<br>
Spirit Walk should break anything with the root, frozen or snared mechanic. This should include all of the things you think it does, such as Entangling Roots, Frost Nova or Hamstring. If you are finding any of these are not included, it is most likely a bug, so do let us know. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/11296587930-gc-what-exactly-is-a-common-rootsnare.html))<br>
<br>
No changes to Enhancement tree after the 10% armor buff on bosses<br>
We didn&apos;t think we needed to buff Enhancement because your boss dps is really high right now. Plus, as you pointed out, some amount of your dps comes from spell damage already so it will affect you less than say rogues and warriors. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/11675538813-devs-adjust-enhance-for-10-armor-changes.html))<br>
<br>
Elemental Tree DPS<br>
We think Elemental single-target damage is good once you can use your fire spells. It is up there with Moonkin and Shadow Priests and similar specs. We have looked at this issue a lot, because it is something we were really worried about.<br>
<br>
Your damage may be low at 70 and this is something we&apos;re evaluating. We&apos;re not sure it is worth the changes it would take to fix it, because it risks messing with the balance between Lightning and Fire that we have now. Your damage is still plenty high enough to level and to do 5-player instances. I don&apos;t mean to suggest Elemental is catastrophically broken, or then we would do a major intervention to fix it. At the moment, the level 70 raids are so easy that we&apos;re not very worried about you getting benched for the next couple of weeks until LK goes live. Once LK goes live, very few people are going to be doing competitive raiding or PvP at level 70.<br>
<br>
Your AE damage is too low. This is something of a design change for us, because we were always satisfied with elemental not being a big AE class. But as I have posted a few times recently, we now think that was a mistake and we want to make some changes. We&apos;re not sure yet whether the best way to do that is through new mechanics, or changes to existing mechanics. After all, your totems are supposed to supply some AE damage and it&apos;s not hard to imagine the changes it would take to get them there. Thunderstorm is somewhere else we could hit it.

Warlock mount quest not useful anymore<br>
It&apos;s a cool quest, and we haven&apos;t removed it. But it&apos;s also true that as we add content, players tend to understandably focus on the more recent content. As a result, we tend to try and speed along some of the earlier stuff. Consider that it was probably far easier for a level 60 warlock to get a group together to complete the quest than it was for a level 70 warlock, just because all of the other level 70s were doing other stuff (like helping a druid complete the epic flight form quest perhaps). Now, maybe a level 80 warlock can solo all of the mount quest content, but that still isn&apos;t going to give them the epic challenge that it sounds like you experienced. More than likely, a lot more warlocks leveling quickly through the older content will just skip over it.<br>
<br>
And we&apos;re okay with that. That quest chain served us all well for a long time. But we have a lot of new epic challanges awaiting us in Northrend. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/11296489025-warlock-mount-trainable-its-over-now.html))</div></div>
