Still don&apos;t know when we&apos;ll get the next PTR patch, which means we can&apos;t get more stats for the moment. We&apos;re pretty sure that the new patch will include new epic boots/belt/wrists matching each arena sets, new epic misc. items (Neck/Ring/Trinket/Whatever makes Blizzard happy)<br>
Cockatrice and Elekk PvP mount are also in the 2.1.2 game files, don&apos;t know if they&apos;ll be included.<br>
<br>
Updates<br>
Infineon updated his Fraps Tutorial (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=293.0) with Dual Core and Windowed Mode informations.<br>
The map of the Sha&apos;tari Skyguards Guide (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=253) has been updated with a few more locations.<br>
The Hall of Fame (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=107) is now complete, it probably won&apos;t need to be updated for a while and a better version could be available soon. <br>
I added the Arena Season 2 sets skins previews to the Arena Rating Calculator (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=249). I also added a small line at the bottom of the page to let you know when the calculator has been upgraded, to make sure that the formula is up to date.<br>
<br>
<br>
That&apos;s all for the moment, should have more interesting things coming soon. (Tomorrow if I don&apos;t slack too much)<br>
<br>
Addon Highlight<br>
A lot of people have been asking about it on the forums, I thought it could be a good thing to mention Ratingbuster (http://www-en.curse-gaming.com/downloads/details/4991/).<br>
On most of my items screenshots, you can notice stats summary, and rating conversion into %, that&apos;s the mod that does everything. It&apos;s very customizeable and I suggest that you read the whole mod description on Curse to tweak it to your desires. <br>
