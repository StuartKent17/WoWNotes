USK.de http://www.usk.de/65_Aktuell_geprueft.htm removed their entry concerning WotLK ... I don't really see why now that it's linked everywhere and made public on other sites like gamespot, but why not. 

L70ETC
L70ETC are now performing in game, you can find them just outside Shattrath each hour. 
Check the video here http://www.youtube.com/v/ISA_nG5smy0

Hint : If you just want to listen at the song, type /script PlaySoundFile"Sound\\Music\\ZoneMusic\\DMF_L70ETC01.mp3" in game. 

Emerald Dream
Even if pretty much anyone on earth know that Northrend will be part of the expansion, I'm still not sure if the Emerald Dream will be here. Theorically we could use the 4 portals in Azeroth to access Northrend through the Emerald Dream, technically the Crystalsong Forest http://www.wowwiki.com/Crystalsong_Forest could be the starting zone in Northrend. 

The Emerald Dream is pretty big though, and I don't really see why Blizzard would use it as a simple transition zone, maybe they're just planning to release an uber-big expansion. 

I'm posting this because while I was going through the 2.2 PTR Patch MPQ files, I noticed that two textures from the Emerald Dream was updated in this patch.

Expansion
While we wait for the Blizzcon, I'll post a few expansions informations depending of the mood. I'll add a probability % to each, they're not 100% accurate but they should be decently reliable.
Level cap should be 80, not 75. 90% Sure
