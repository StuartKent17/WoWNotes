Diablo at BlizzCon 2018<br>
BlizzCon 2018 is almost here and we&#x2019;ve seen a lot of rumors flying around about our plans for Diablo at the show. These are very exciting times&#x2014;we currently have multiple teams working on different Diablo projects and we can&#x2019;t wait to tell you all about them . . . when the time is right.<br>
<br>
We know what many of you are hoping for and we can only say that &#x201C;good things come to those who wait,&#x201D; but evil things often take longer. We appreciate your patience as our teams work tirelessly to create nightmarish experiences worthy of the Lord of Terror.<br>
<br>
While we won&#x2019;t be ready to announce all of our projects, we do intend to share some Diablo-related news with you at the show.<br>
<br>
November 2 will be an especially diabolical date&#x2014;not only is it the first day of BlizzCon, it&#x2019;s also when Diablo III arrives on the Nintendo Switch. If you&#x2019;re planning to pick up the game (the digital download will be available starting at midnight on launch day) and are joining us in Anaheim, be sure to bring your console. We&#x2019;d love to slay some demons with you on the show floor.<br>
<br>
Again, we want to thank you for your patience and support. We are eternally grateful to you and the millions of other Diablo fans around the world whose passion for this franchise inspires us and keeps our fires burning.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll see you in hell . . . and at BlizzCon!</div></div>
