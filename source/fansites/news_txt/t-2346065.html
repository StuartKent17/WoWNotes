Glory of the Argus Raider Achievement Complete<br>
The Achievements Discord has completed the Glory of the Argus Raider (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11987-glory-of-the-argus-raider) achievement both in the US and EU. <br>
<br>
The EU group was lead by Nightswifty (https://twitter.com/Nightswifty) and the US group was led by Yonexx (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/thrall/yonexx).<br>
<br>
The Achievements Discord (https://discord.gg/VTS4mFQ) is a community where players can form groups for achievements and meet like-minded completionists. Groups often complete Herald of the Titans (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/3316-herald-of-the-titans), Show Me Your Moves (Show Me Your Moves!), Glory of the Argus Raider (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11987-glory-of-the-argus-raider), and all other kinds of activities as well. Players are provided with roles that match their regions and factions in order to be notified whenever someone is organizing an event that they might be interested in, which makes forming groups much easier.<br>
