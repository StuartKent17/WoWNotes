The Armory Tools http://armory.mmo-champion.com/ http://armory.mmo-champion.com/ were based on an open source script from Antiarc, who first published it on http://wow.tachyonsix.com/armory/ http://wow.tachyonsix.com/armory/. 

Sadly, I didn't have the time and the knowledge to update it, and I had a few bugs on the site that I couldn't really fix. I thought it might be a good idea to ask Antiarc if he would like to be hosted on mmo-champion.com. 

The main Armory Tools http://armory.mmo-champion.com/ site is now hosted on the site and run independently by Antiarc. It should be more up to date than what I had on the site earlier. And before someone ask in comments, yes the gold sellers ads are removed and you can report them, posting in comments is fine
