Another day, another kill by Paragon  who was the first guild to defeat the Ascendant Council of the Twilight Bastion in the world. Congratulations to them!

The second day of year 2011 brought us Ascendant Council 25-man heroic mode kill. This was one of the fights we were most looking forward to after beta testing. It was a huge letdown for some, but others enjoyed it. Somewhat bittersweet.

Also, a big thank you for the melee DPS'ers who play in the guild. They had to pass up spots again for alts, simply because the encounter design is incredibly punishing for any melee. It's a pretty glaring oversight when bringing in more than one or two of them results in ridiculous increases in damage taken in the last phase due to non-stop chaining chain lightning. Dropping out melee characters in favor of ranged ones has been a recurring theme throughout this whole raiding tier, but we hope that it's over now with only the end bosses and Sinestra left.

Here's to hoping next tier of raiding won't favor ranged by design. Maybe even go wild and give some incentive to bring in melee, too. Paragon.fi
