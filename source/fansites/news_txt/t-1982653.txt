Blue Posts
Prestige and Honor Talents
We aren't planning any changes to how Honor Talents and Prestige work in Ranked Play. The cost and conflict is intentional. It's important that in order for Prestige levels to feel prestigious, there is a high cost to doing it. You do not have to Prestige. There is no competitive advantage to doing it. There are rewards but they are entirely cosmetic. If you see someone with a high Prestige level, we want you to know they went through a lot to get it.

Skirmishes in Legion
We've made a change to Skirmish in Legion. Rather than having two separate buttons 2v2 and 3v3, there is only one button and it will put you in either 2v2 or 3v3 depending on a number of factors. Our experience with the separate buttons in Warlords was that you would often end up in 2s match where only one team had a healer or a 3s match with triple DPS. Neither of these situations felt very fun and the reality is there are far less healers playing than damage. We want Skirmishes queues to pop fast but allow for pretty fair fights.

In Legion, healers specs are always placed in 3v3 matches while damage specs are placed in either 2v2 or 3v3 depending on what is available. This means 2v2 skirmishes will never have healers in them and 3v3 matches will always have healers on each team.

So much for couples that liked to play 2's
Ranked 2s is still available. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/408741-3s-skirmish-gone-for-good-or-just-in-the-currnet-built/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743254500?page=1#8

PvP talents
You can only unlock Honor talents at level 110.

You should remove the "honour" experience bar from low levels then.
Agreed. That is in progress. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/408732-pvp-talents/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743154533?page=1#8

Battlegrounds on Beta
Battleground are not launching because there are not enough people queuing for them. Our plan is to temporarily disable skirmishes when we launch beta to get some focused battleground testing while concurrency is high.

Relentless http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/196029-relentless PvP Talent
We think there is a group of players that would prefer to just be in less CC overall. It may not be as attractive at the very highest ratings and that's okay.

Affliction Warlock Feedback -- Build 21466 -- 13-Apr
Not entirely feedback, but there's no good place to ask this and it effects future feedback so:

Can we get a confirmed value on agony's soul shard proc rate for affliction? In previous expansions the information was available in spell data on the nightfall passive, but there doesn't seem to be any spell data for agony's proc rate anymore.

I did a couple thousand tick test awhile back and got an estimate around 13.5% but any modeling of the spec will be estimation without spell data or a confirmed value.
Similar to before, it's a ramping proc chance. The first tick, it's 2.5%. Assuming that fails to proc, next tick it'll be 5%, then 7.5%, etc. When it does proc, the next tick returns to 2.5%.

So in a general sense, its proc rate is: TicksSinceLastSuccessfulProc * 2.5%

That averages out to ~13.15%, but much smoother and reliable that a simple 13.15% proc chance.

Now that we got some Blue posting in Affliction feedback thread. Can we get an explanation to the Legion re-design of Unstable Affliction spamming. I've leveled a 3rd Affliction lock on alpha, and I am already seeing myself incredibly bored and unappealed with this weird focus of spamming Frostbolt---I mean UA. 

Sidenote: I play 3 Aff locks on live, I need to know if I have the tolerance to fast level 3 Aff locks at launch.

Anyways... Was this design solely made on paper, and not exercised prior to presenting it to the Affliction Warlock playerbase? I don't feel like a warlock, I feel like a Frost Mage. I love the talent tree, it has so much potential depth. I love the tanky-ness, does give me a more resilient. That UA spamming though... I don't know how long I can muster playing that style of DPS. One of the reasons I rolled out of Mage in p1.8 and embraced the Affliction in 1.9. ALL HAIL! THE ONE TRUE GOD, FOREDOOMED!
I've heard this feedback many times, and have yet to have it make any sense. As far as gameplay goes, you do something like one UA every ~8sec single target. That doesn't really jive with the 'spamming UA sucks' feedback. You may very well do several back to back, but then go a long period with casting none. So where is this 'spamming UA sucks' feedback coming from?

Is the ramping soulshard proc chance on agony different for each individual agony or is it based on all agony's you have out?
All Agonys you have out. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/408177-affliction-warlock-feedback-build-21466-13-apr/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743214168?page=2#35
