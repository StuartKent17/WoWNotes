Thanks to player reports and feedback, we&#x2019;ve identified a bug affecting how XP was calculated for parties of 6 or more players.<br>
We are rolling out a hotfix right now, to all realms, that should correct this. Going forward, XP awarded should be significantly lower for parties of 6 or more players.<br>
<br>
Again, thank you very much for your feedback.<br>

Barron&apos;s - Activision Stock Potential Price Increase<br>
Reuters recently (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-activision-stocks/world-of-warcraft-nostalgia-to-boost-activision-blizzard-barrons-idUSKCN1VM1LK) cited a Barron&apos;s report that pointed to a potential stock price growth due the positive reception of World of Warcraft classic. Classic set a set a record for launch-day concurrent viewers on Twitch. <br>

<br>
Barron&#x2019;s cited reports of hours-long wait times to log into the game, and quoted Blizzard Entertainment, a subsidiary of Activision, as saying World of Warcraft Classic set a record for launch-day concurrent viewers on Twitch, a platform which hosts live-streams of gamers playing which people can watch.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The business model for World of Warcraft is highly profitable, with a subscription costing $15 a month. If World of Warcraft Classic drives a couple million new subscribers for a few quarters, it would boost the company&#x2019;s earnings significantly,&#x201D; Barron&#x2019;s said.</div></div>
