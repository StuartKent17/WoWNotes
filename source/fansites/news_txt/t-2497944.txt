Creatures and NPCs

Some snails and slugs in the Coral Forest have managed to wriggle out from underneath the tree they were stuck under.

Heart of Azeroth

Resolved an issue that caused some abilities granted by Conflict and Strife Essence to be taught to a character twice.
The Well of Existence Essence now despawns when the player who placed it logs out.

Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented Dribbling Inkpod’s passive effect from activating when an enemy reached 30% health and increased the duration of the debuff to 2 minutes was 1 minute.


Player versus Player

Resolved an issue that prevented Sphere of Suppression's Essence movement speed reduction from being removed by effects such as Blessing of Freedom.

Resolved an issue that prevented Season 3 Duelists from obtaining the Dreadflame weapon illusion.
Items
