Battlefield: Barrens Ending Soon - Update<br>
Ok...so Gahzrookie, the gloves, and the bag will be around...but what about the troll shoes, Xan&apos;tish&apos;s flute, and the other vanity items?<br>
Also, titles account-wide pretty please?<br>
Every item other than the pet, the Brawler&apos;s Guild item, and the 24-slot bag, and the ability to earn the title are being removed. We know a lot of you would like to have the cosmetic goodies readily available to pick up with other characters or to share with your alts, but this event was designed to be part of the story for the game at this point in time. For those who earned their title, you now carry a badge of honor for having helped the war effort against Garrosh.<br>
<br>
The weekly quest was designed as both--and most importantly--an event that leads up to Patch 5.4 and the Siege of Orgrimmar, and an opportunity for level 90 characters to work on getting gear a bit quicker in preparation for the new content. Now that the story of this expansion will be pressing forward with the patch, it will be time to wrap up some of the activity in Durotar and Northern Barrens. Think of the action in those areas as exclusive for where we are at this point in the game (not unlike the gathering quests for Ahn&apos;Qiraj and the Scourge Event before Wrath of the Lich King).<br>
<br>
Crithto: I have an alt, a pally I am levelling. What I wanted to do was give her the tokens (she has them) then with the BOA mojo, send those to her so she had a 489 starter set.<br>
I was *really* hoping yall would at least consider making the radical mojo&apos;s BoA so that we could complete our sets at the very least.<br>
I would simply like to ask that you reconsider this. At least make the Radical Mojo BOA. Please.<br>
Please know that I completely understand how you guys are feeling about this and have several alts I&apos;ve been working on, too. But let&apos;s not forget that the Radical Mojo clearly displays &quot;Binds when picked up&quot;. Simply switching it to BoA would be nice for those who have more than one unused, but it would be unfair to everyone else who did not stockpile a BoP item.<br>
<br>
For those seeking opportunities to provide your alts with gear, the Timeless Isle will be your new favorite place to visit. The tokens you can find there are BoA before being used, and can be passed to any of your alts to generate an item for his/her spec. The gear you create will be item-level 496, and as you progress through the Isle, you will also have the chance to upgrade them to item-level 535.<br>
<br>
Lastly, while Ravika has other important duties to attend to once 5.4 goes live, we know that Griftah&apos;s Authentic Troll Shoes hold a soft spot in many hearts, so we&#x2019;re currently exploring options to reintroduce them at a later date.<br>

Mastery Enchants on Characters Under Level 80<br>
We&apos;re actually modifying Windsong to not proc Mastery for players below level 80. It will always proc either Crit or Haste.<br>
<br>
For flat Mastery enchants... maybe don&apos;t put them on characters that don&apos;t have Mastery yet. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/267501-mastery-under-level-80/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9793019310?page=2#22))<br>
<br>
Connected Realms and Faction Balance<br>
While faction balance is one of the factors that will be taken into account when deciding on which realms we will connect, we will most likely not see a perfect faction balance on the connected realms in the end. The reason for this is that the Alliance is generally the most popular faction on PvE realms, while it is the Horde that is the most popular on PvP realms... and we cannot connect PvE with PvP realms. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/267474-another-question-of-the-virtual-realms/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7960706205?page=2#22))<br>
<br>
Arena Pass Title and Pet<br>
The rated phase has ended, but the plan is to keep the realms up for a while. It is no longer possible to do games that count towards the pet or title. <br>
Just highlighting this to ensure that everyone is aware that the rated phase has now concluded. Any games that are played outside of the rated phase won&apos;t count towards the pet or title reward, so you can&apos;t gain credit towards either of these anymore. <br>
<br>
Just so you know though; the realm will be sticking around for a while yet, so you can definitely feel free to sign up and play some epic PvP action!

Patch 5.4 Elemental Shaman RNG<br>
Isnt half the problem the mastery duplicate coupled with haste induced ticks on their flame shock giving so many free instants? echo of elements was only half the issue. <br>
Several things compounded to create the complaints that we have been seeing for Elemental Shamans, Echo of Elements and Lava Surge procs as well as the mastery spell duplication were all parts of it. We nerfed Echo of Elements to take the edge off of extreme elemental burst situations and we will continue monitoring every class and make changes as we feel they are needed.<br>
<br>
RNG in PvP such as the procs listed above for Elemental Shamans is something that our developers are having ongoing discussions about. In the long run what we want to accomplish is to limit the excessive cases when and wherever possible, such as we did with Echo of Elements. The developers recognize and understand that some players would prefer there to be no randomness in PvP at all, but we don&apos;t feel that this would result in good gameplay overall.<br>
<br>
But there needs to be a limit to it, ele shamans right now aren&apos;t fun to play against. <br>
We entirely agree and this is the kind of RNG that we are referring to when I said &quot;excessive cases when and wherever possible&quot;. To try and combat that extreme and random burst that comes from Elemental Shamans we nerfed Echo of the Elements and feel that this should help deal with the the extreme cases of RNG for them. We will be keeping an eye on RNG in PvP and continue to discuss ways in which we can deal with any extreme cases that arise.

Chaos Bolt Buff<br>
We agree that Destruction is a bit low in 5.4. We also recognize that, particularly after the Kil&apos;Jaeden&apos;s Cunning changes, Chaos Bolt has become a &quot;riskier&quot; spell to cast. To both ends, we think a Chaos Bolt buff is in order. We&apos;re going to bring it up by 15% and see where that puts things.<br>
<br>
Our general philosophy for Destruction in 5.4 is that casting Chaos Bolt can be tricky sometimes -- working around interrupts and LOS in PvP, or sneaking them in between periods of movement in PvE -- but when the cast goes off, it hurts. A lot. We do have to be careful not to push things TOO far, but we&apos;ll see how things go from here.<br>
<br>
This change was applied via hotfix sometime yesterday, so it should already be live on the PTR if you&apos;d like to get some testing in.
