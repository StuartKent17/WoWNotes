Patch 5.2 - Troves of the Thunder King<br>
Patch 5.2 makes use of solo scenarios for several storytelling purposes, but one of the scenarios (http://ptr.wowdb.com/zones/6716-troves-of-the-thunder-king) is purely to give you loot! To enter the scenario, you need to acquire a Key to the Palace of Lei Shen (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94222-key-to-the-palace-of-lei-shen). This key drops very rarely from mobs on the Isle of Thunder, more often from rare spawns on the Isle of Thunder, and in the rare spawn chests that appear on the isle. <br>

<br>
Once inside, you can purchase various items (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=16408&amp;filter-ilvl-min=90&amp;filter-ilvl-max=90&amp;filter-quality=2&amp;filter-source=16384) for one to three Elder Charms to make the scenario easier. These allow you to do things like sleep a target for 25 seconds (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/97154-sleep-dust), walk on water and over tile traps (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/97157-potion-of-light-steps), open a single locked gate (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/97155-polymorphic-key), distract (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/97158-a-common-rock) or trap a mob (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/97156-frost-rune-trap), and a quick forward jump (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/97159-arcane-propellant). Most of these items require a reputation level higher than friendly, so you will want to earn reputation with the new daily quest factions to take advantage of these items. <br>
<br>
When you are ready you can speak to Taoshi (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/70320-taoshi) to begin. Once the doors open, you have five minutes to loot as many chests as you can. The only thing standing in your way are hostile NPCs, doors locked by levers, and lots of traps. There are columns of lightning that slow you down and cause damage, spiders that web you to the ground, tile traps on the floor that will stun, throw, or damage you, statues that will stun and damage you, or sentries that will damage you. <br>
<br>
The hostile NPCs consist of patrolling trolls, lions that wake up when you enter combat near them, and a final boss (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/70400-god-hulk-gulkan#related:criteria-of). The final boss is carrying one of the Golden Treasure Chests (http://ptr.wowdb.com/objects/218772-golden-treasure-chest) and guarding three others. <br>
<br>
While looting the chests, you will come across the smaller Mogu Treasure Chests (http://ptr.wowdb.com/objects/218757-mogu-treasure-chest) that contain 5-10 gold, Mote of Harmony (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/89112-mote-of-harmony), Spirit of Harmony (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/76061-spirit-of-harmony), Shan&apos;ze Ritual Stones (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94221-shanze-ritual-stone), Elder Charm of Good Fortune (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/697-elder-charm-of-good-fortune), a Tattered Historical Parchments (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/95491-tattered-historical-parchments), and Burial Trove Keys (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/95497-burial-trove-key). <br>
<br>
The chest you are really interested in are the Golden Treasure Chests (http://ptr.wowdb.com/objects/218772-golden-treasure-chest), as they contain greater amounts of the items from the other chest, as well as higher drop rates and more gold.<br>
<br>
After the five minutes has elapsed, Taoshi pulls you out to a safe room with several of Lei Shen&apos;s Burial Troves (http://ptr.wowdb.com/objects/218949-lei-shens-burial-trove), which require the Burial Trove Key (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/95497-burial-trove-key) to open. Inside these chests you will find the same loot as the previous chests, but even more of it, along with 10 Justice Points and roughly 60 gold.<br>
<br>
One well executed run can earn several hundred gold, 10+ Elder Charms, some Shan&apos;ze Ritual Stones (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94221-shanze-ritual-stone), 20-30+ Tattered Historical Parchments (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/95491-tattered-historical-parchments), and many Motes and Spirit of Harmony. It is unlikey you will earn this much on your first few runs, as it takes time to learn where all of the chests are. <br>

Patch 5.2 - Ra-den&apos;s Room Updated<br>
Throne of Thunder has received some significant improvements since we last previewed it (Indoor (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azPDC7Gbnws) / Outdoor (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLW6u1H_f9A)). One of the bigger changes is the improvement made to Ra-den&apos;s room.<br>

Patch 5.2 Official Notes Updated<br>
The Chinese Battle.Net site (http://www.battlenet.com.cn/wow/zh/blog/7619611/52%E8%A1%A5%E4%B8%81%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E5%99%A8%E8%A1%A5%E4%B8%81%E8%AF% B4%E6%98%8E%EF%BC%882%E6%9C%8818%E6%97%A5%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0%EF%BC%89-2013%E5%B9%B42%E6%9C%8818%E6%97%A5) had their Patch 5.2 notes updated, so the US and EU should be updating soon as well. Thanks to ngacnlcq for the translation! Keep in mind that this may not be perfectly accurate, so should be regarded as a preview of what is to come, not fact.<br>

Power Word: Solace has been replaced with a new talent: Solace &amp; Insanity<br>
For Holy and Discipline, Power Word: Solace replaces Holy Fire. It deals the same damage, and interacts with other spells and abilities in the same manner, but Power Word: Solace doesnt trigger Atonement, is instant, costs no mana, and restores 1% of maximum mana on each cast. When Power Word: Solace deals damage, it will also heal a friendly player within 40 yards of the target equal to 100% of its damage (When priest is healed, the healing is equal to 50% of its damage).<br>
Power Infusion now also causes priest to deal 10% more damage, other effects remain unchanged.<br>
Discipline<br>
Mastery: Shield Discipline now also increases healing of all healing spells, but the bonus it provides reduced by 36%.<br>
The range of Penance is 40 yards to both friendly targets and enemies (was 40 yards to friendly targets and 30 yards to enemies). <br>
Spirit Shell now provides an absorbing shield equal to your average healing and absorb effects, including critical healing and Divine Aegis. Spirit Shell no longer benefits from Mastery, and now properly includes the benefits of Divine Aegis and critical effect chance.<br>
Divine Aegis now causes critical healing to apply an absorbing shield to the target, equal to 100% of the healing, rather than double healing. In additional, it also causes Power Word: Shield to have a chance equal to priest&apos;s critical change to absorb double damage. Divine Aegis is no longer guaranteed when Prayer of Healing is cast. The effect now activates when the spell crits.<br>

Normal Difficulty Learning Curve<br>
How are we expected to gear up to iLevel 500 for 5.2 when the 5.0 Raids are tuned so horribly? There is no learning curve at all for the first 8 Bosses. They can all be beaten on the first few pulls with the exception of Elegon who might take an hour or two. Then comes Garalon who is so tightly tuned it feels like pre-nerf Spine HC. <br>
Patch 5.2 will reduce the damage and health of bosses on Patch 5.0 raids by 10%. And The 5.0 Raid Finders will have their droprate upped as well. Pair that with Patch 5.2&apos;s upcoming Raid Finder (which requires item level 480) and hopefully you&apos;ll have more than enough gear in a timely manner to finish whichever bosses you have still left in 5.0 and move on to the Throne of Thunder.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately Draztal the game doesn&apos;t work like that as much as Blizzard would like it too. When 5.2 comes out, even those players that didn&apos;t get around to completing T14 raids will enter ToT and forget all about T14 raids. Granted there is not &quot;catch up&quot; system this time like other tiers which is good and bad ( good from a new player PoV, bad from an alt PoV). I hope this doesn&apos;t lead to normal modes gettign hit hard with nerf bats like firelands was<br>
If they have enough gear to push through ToT certainly they have it to clear the remainder bosses of 5.0 raids once 5.2 has been released. Of course, it&apos;s up to each individual guild to do whatever they consider better. If they don&apos;t feel like finishing MV/HoF/TES... more power to them? Those that clear it before current content on normal will get a Feat of Strength called &quot;Ahead of the Curve&quot; for each of the end bosses in these three raids, too.

Of all professions, which one could need the most work to be better in the next expansion?<br>
I&apos;d say Leatherworking, but would be interested in other opinions. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/292390814754160641))<br>

When you make acc wid proffessions i close my account sorry this idea is Bullshit .<br>

PTR Changes to Blacksmith leveling are inspired. Can we see Tailoring &amp; Leatherworking getting the same treatment?<br>

How many would you like ideally? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294620737946386432))<br>
<br>
Please don&apos;t let space issues get pushed past 5.2. Add a 2nd expensive void storage page. Should be trivial to implement.<br>
Void Storage wasn&apos;t designed to let players keep every piece of gear ever or we wouldn&apos;t have capped it at all. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/296428985779376128))<br>
<br>
Any plans w/LFR loot to allow passing on loot you already have? Or allowing players to choose the type of loot they get?<br>
Letting players choose to e.g. raid as Ret but choose Holy gear is something we plan on doing (though unlikely to make 5.2). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/296428417484742656))<br>
We don&apos;t like passing in LFR. The entire point of the new system is to remove the social element of loot among strangers. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/296428265835474944))<br>
<br>
hey, remember the Battle for Undercity quest chain, and how it was removed. It would make a great scenario!<br>
We agree. If only we had scenario tech back then. A good wish list feature for someday. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/296422817472319489))<br>

Warlock class mount fire should be green too! I like green. I just love it. I like every kind of green...<br>
Class mount change requires different artists than the spells, but we can try and get it for 5.3. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/300000377867210753))<br>

what are the chances of a tabard list like pets and mounts? like to keep my 25 or so keepers but need that bank space.<br>

UI / Addons<br>
Have you guys ever though on getting rid of all 3rd party add-ons in WoW? I think it would add &amp; fix a lot of problems @Ghostcrawler<br>
Not really. It&apos;s a ton of work to support them, but many if not most players use some. The customization is cool and valuable. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293082013886476289))<br>
<br>
Do you think that the AH needs an overhaul? From a gold maker&apos;s point of view this default AH UI is entirely insufficient.<br>
We understand that folks who play lots of AH want additional functionality. Seems like a fine roll for add-ons though, no? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/296436343972708356))<br>
<br>
Ever considered adding a UI element for players to track important buffs/cooldowns? Just icons/bars, with minor customization.<br>
We&apos;ve considered it. Players are very specific about what / how they want info displayed though, so it&apos;s tough to design. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/298896525411631104))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
and your solution was adding a bunch of crap to the game (pet battles, LFR, transmog, challenge... when we just wanted raids<br>
I think it&apos;s a dangerous use of &quot;we&quot; to assume a lot of players prefer raiding to pet battles or transmog. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/296431573295845376))<br>

Not true. Having nothing to do in Cata started in 4.1 with months of only two dungeons. Very few complaints in 4.0<br>
Players stopped playing 4.0 very quickly. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/296639540989403139))<br>

U&apos;ve tried so many things 2 keep and bring back players but not a loyalty scheme. Seems pretty mean spirited. R u a meanie GC?<br>
I am a meanie. Loyalty schemes are tricky. Ones used by airline and phone companies say &quot;Don&apos;t you DARE switch even if you hate us.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294894975852900352))<br>

It would seem though loud and angry mobs motivate more change then civil and intelligent posts. Sadly, that is how it appears.<br>
It&apos;s not true. I think anger is what you insert in an argument when you don&apos;t have anything else. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/296640973600088064))<br>
