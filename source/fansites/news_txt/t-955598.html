World first Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa&apos;s Rest by Siiz (US-Senjin / Premonition)<br>
Siiz (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/senjin/Siiz/advanced) from Premonition (http://premoguild.com/forums/portal.php) (US - Sen&apos;jin) was the first player in the world to acquire Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa&apos;s Rest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71086/dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest/)! Congratulations to him.<br>
<br>
And to answer the top 2 questions about the mount portion of the staff: <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The mount has a 1.5 sec cast time just like any other mount.<br>
People can&apos;t ride on your back. <br>
The giant dragon in the 2nd screenshot isn&apos;t the mount, it&apos;s Tarecgosa during the end event of the questline.<br>
