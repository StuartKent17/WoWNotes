A Sign of Good Fortune Ahead
Legends say that in his hour of deepest doubt, Emperor Shaohao, last ruler of the Pandaren Empire, was visited by Hogrus, Swine of Good Fortune, as he meditated upon his people’s future. Today, pandaren across Azeroth consider Hogrus to be a sign of prosperity and great things to come. You would be wise to seek his blessing as you pursue your own fortune, wherever the four winds may take you.

This lucky new mount is bound to propel you into a prosperous year ahead—and it’s now available in the Blizzard Shop and World of Warcraft in-game shop.
