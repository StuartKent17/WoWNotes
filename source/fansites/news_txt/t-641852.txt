Boubouille2009-04-02, 04:26 PMSartharion 10-Man killed with 3 Drakes in 76 Seconds
A few people sent me this video of a fairly impressive kill of Sartharion with 3 Drakes up in Normal Mode. Instead of trying to manage the adds and Sartharion at the same time, the raid just rushed Sartharion to took him down as fast as possible and surprisingly ... it worked! 

Obviously it won't work with most of the raid composition and you will need a lot of DPS to achieve such a fast kill, but it could be an interesting way to farm the encounter for everyone when most of the players are geared with Ulduar items ...

Noblegarden Rescheduled
Nethaera just posted a message to announce that the Noblegarden event will be delayed this year. It definitely looks like another confirmation that Patch 3.1 won't hit the live servers before April 14 at least. 
Many players may have noticed that Noblegarden has been removed from the in-game calendar. While the event is not being removed from the game, it is being delayed slightly and will not occur as originally scheduled on April, 12. We will be implementing this event at a future date, however.

There have been many additions made to the event including a change to the length of which the event runs 1 week and additional content for players to enjoy. We look forward to sharing this new experience with you. 


Websites Updates - Part 2
A few more things were fixed on the site.

I removed the huge boss posts from the front page to make the loading time faster, this will probably make IE users very happy. 
I corrected a few errors in boss pages, I also added the meta-achievement to the Noblegarden achievements page. 
A few bugs with the menu are being fixed as we speak. It will now save the position of the menu between page changes and a few visual bugs have been fixed with IE.

We're still working with a few bugs, now might be the right time to report them in the Suggestions and Feedback  forums.


Filefront NOT closing down
FileFront has been acquired by the original founders of the site and will NOT be suspended as previously announced. This is NOT an April Fool's Joke.

After learning about Ziff Davis Media's plan to suspend FileFront at the end of March, the original founders of FileFront made the decision to buy it back from Ziff Davis Media.

We're happy to announce to the gaming community that as of today, April 1st, 2009, FileFront is a completely independent company again and is no longer part of Ziff Davis Media. All previously suspended services should be active and working again. We thank Ziff Davis Media for their cooperation and willingness to keep the site and community alive.

Due to the very unfortunate timing of this event and related announcements on March 24th and April 1st April Fool's Day, we'd like to make it perfectly clear that:

[i] 1 The March 24th announcement about FileFront suspending its operation was NOT an early April Fool's joke.
2 This announcement about the original founders buying back FileFront from Ziff Davis Media is also NOT an April Fool's joke.
3 We're making this announcement on April 1st because the deal was completed today and we want to bring all services back online immediately.
4 We would NEVER suspend FileFront as an April Fool's joke.
5 We are happy to be back!

FileFront has existed in one form or another originally as FileLeech and Voodoo Extreme's downloads since 1997. In the last 12 years, FileFront has become the gaming community's most comprehensive and trafficked library hosting millions of files for thousands of games while requiring no registration and providing uncapped download speeds. We look forward to improving FileFront and serving the gaming community for years to come.

Welcome home. Game On! Source
