Currency Conversion Before and After Mists of Pandaria
The currency conversion coming with Mists of Pandaria is going to happen in three stages, and this is how we plan for it to progress:

With Patch 5.0.4 on August 28

Valor points will be converted to Justice points, and Conquest points will be converted to Honor points.

Neither of the resultant currencies Justice and Honor will have an enforced hard-cap at this time.


The current Arena season will end.
Players will no longer be able to earn Valor or Conquest points bosses will drop Justice, Arenas will be closed.
Items formerly purchasable for Valor/Conquest will be available for Justice/Honor.


With Mists of Pandaria on September 25

Valor can be earned again.

Characters can earn up to 1000 Valor per week, and carry a maximum of 3000 Valor.
Daily quests, random Scenarios, random Heroic dungeons, and all levels of raiding will reward Valor.
Valor will be used to purchase ilvl 489 gear in Mists of Pandaria.

The Klaxxi http://www.wowdb.com/factions/1337-the-klaxxi, Golden Lotus http://www.wowdb.com/factions/1269-golden-lotus, Shado-Pan http://www.wowdb.com/factions/1270-shado-pan, and August Celestials http://www.wowdb.com/factions/1341-the-august-celestials factions will sell this gear.
Revered reputation with each faction will be required.



Conquest will become earnable.

There is a cap of 4000 Conquest points.
Arenas and Rated Battlegrounds reward Conquest.
It will be used to purchase ilvl 483 gear http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Malevolent+Gladiator%27s from Pandaren battlemasters http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/65165-doris-chiltonius on the Great Wall.




With Mists of Pandaria, Patch 5.1

We currently plan to upgrade the Valor system as Ghostcrawler described in Mists of Pandaria Looting Explained http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219630-dev-watercooler-mists-of-pandaria-looting-explained/ in the 5.1 patch, allowing you to upgrade your gear using Valor points. Weâ€™ll have additional information once Mists of Pandaria launches and we get closer to the 5.1 patch release.

Raid DPS Test Dummies
We're aware of the issue with pets getting debuffed by the dummies and have a fix coming for that. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/232482-raid-dps-test-dummies/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6307802424?page=13#260

LFR Feedback
never understood what's so bad about wanting to be a special snowflake, btw. If some people get sense of joy from that, why not let them.
There's nothing bad about it. The issue comes when demands are made to artificially create an environment that lets someone be identified as a "snowflake". If someone wants to be a snowflake, you'll have to go the extra mile, prove your worth, do what others don't... but not sit in a corner asking to please prevent others from getting what you did long ago.

The issue with these kind of discussions is that at some point, they end up being driven by hyperbole and harassment. 

If all your arguments in either direction revolve around discrediting others through personal attacks rather than their arguments, then it's probably time to lock the thread.

However, my main concern with both LFR and LFD is the removal of the player from the world environment. Whilst I do believe LFD is a great tool for servers with a low population I used to be on Dragonmaw which has a very low population and finding a group for just a 5 man could have taken hours, finding groups for dungeons and raids and then travelling to the instance felt like an important part of the game and kept the virtual idea of a world. The removal of this feature, and the lack of motivation and incentive to form groups with people on your own server has damaged realm society in my opinion.
Mists of Pandaria comes with plenty of level 90 content. All the daily quests available throughout Pandaria remember, there's no daily cap in Mists, Pet battles, Challenge Dungeons which can't be accessed through the Dungeon Finder and require groups to be manually formed, and the two new world bosses in Valley of the Four Winds and Kun-Lai Summit will hopefully provide plenty of reason to go outside the faction cities.

We'll wait and see I guess, since whatever concern we try to explain gets countered with the sheer overwhelming blinding light at the end of the tunnel called MoP. Overly sarcastic? Yes, perhaps, simply because currently you're bringing arguments to the table we cannot refute due to the content not being out.
I know the only thing you can do on this regard is "wait and see". I'm not saying "MoP will fix it and there'll be rainbows and unicorns", but I do believe that if you take into account all the features and new raiding content coming up at level 90, things will look very different to most players compared to these days.
