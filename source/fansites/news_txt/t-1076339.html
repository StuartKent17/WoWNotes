Darkmoon Faire Achievement Progress Update - Feb 3<br>
&quot;]January&#x2019;s Darkmoon Faire achievement progress status was cleared prior to the launch of February&apos;s faire. Any achievements that were started but not completed have had their criteria reset. Completed achievements are unaffected. <br>
<br>
However, any future achievement progress (February included) will be saved to your character and will continue to contribute towards progression of those achievements in subsequent visits to Darkmoon Faire. <br>
<br>
Regrettably, we are not able to restore any progress you may have made during January&apos;s faire. We do appreciate the impact this may have had and sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused.<br>

WoW Raid Design<br>
Some solid, constructive feedback and observations have been offered in this thread. But I think it&#x2019;s important to point out that it&#x2019;s incorrect to assume that there has been reduced development time put into raids. <br>
<br>
If anything, over the years we&#x2019;ve put increased attention into raids so that a wider breadth of players can experience them. There are a great deal more options for pursuing raiding now than say, in classic World of Warcraft or The Burning Crusade, when raid groups were a fixed size and only one difficulty setting existed. We realize that some players prefer to run with 24 other comrades-in-arms at the max difficulty setting (I&#x2019;m actually one of them ), whereas others prefer more intimate raids or a lower difficulty setting. <br>
<br>
In Mists of Pandaria, we plan to be able to continue to support a wide variety of raiding styles. And, from one player to another, if you&#x2019;re eager for raid zones with an &#x201C;epic&#x201D; feel, you&#x2019;re going to really enjoy some of the stuff we have in store. We&#x2019;ll have some further details on that front coming up in the near future, but know that we really do appreciate your passion for the game and your continued feedback. We are listening. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216845-the-future-of-wow-raids/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3881924701?page=13#259))<br>

Mists of Pandaria Talent Calculator<br>
The intent of the talent calculator was to give players something to fool around with. We wanted everyone to get a feel for the idea we&apos;re going for in Mists so that it wouldn&apos;t sound as crazy or shocking when seen on &quot;paper.&quot; <br>
<br>
We&apos;ve responded many times about talent calculator feedback, even pointing out we&apos;re not going to be able to discuss things point by point with players because the systems are rapidly changing while in development. The calculator itself is quite out of date.<br>
<br>
So you&apos;re right. I took the time to respond to this thread when I could&apos;ve responded elsewhere. But what did I say? I basically said things are looking awesome so far and I can&apos;t wait to be able to share more information.<br>
<br>
Would you feel better if I found a thesis from you about the problems you have with the out-of-date Mists talent calculator for rogues, only to say, &quot;A lot of the details you&apos;re discussing aren&apos;t fully fleshed out yet, so we&apos;ll talk again when we have updated Mists class info to provide&quot;? Even if you think the answer to that is &quot;yes,&quot; I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if you then came back here in two weeks to tell me how many amazing threads there are out there about the &quot;REAL&quot; issues that are going completely ignored. It&apos;s a neverending cycle and I&apos;m not interesting in always looking for the squeakiest wheels to grease on the forums.<br>
<br>
The only inevitability in community management I&apos;ve found is that, whenever we post ANYWHERE on the forums, someone will be sure to tell us where we should be posting, and which part of the community is really being ignored.
