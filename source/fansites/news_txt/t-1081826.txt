The Heart of the Aspects http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/78924/heart-of-the-aspects/ is now available for 25 USD on the US store http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=1100001913 and 20 EUR on the EU store http://eu.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=221005143.
When attacking from the air, it's best to advance from the angle of the sun so as to blind your foesâ€¦ Or just ride a luminous dragon that glows like a thousand suns. Either way, you're good.

The Heart of the Aspects flying mount will travel as fast as your riding skill will take you and, once purchased, applies to all present and future characters on a single North American World of Warcraft license.
