http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/us-en.png Free Character Migrations Next Week
We'll be offering Free Character Migrations next week for realms currently seeing high queue times at login. Those looking to avoid waiting to log in can take advantage of the free transfers to a set destination realm.

We're targeting the middle of next week for these Free Character Migrations to become available, and they'll remain open for approximately one week, or until a destination realm fills up. If you're looking to transfer with others we recommend setting up plans early to avoid any stragglers being left behind.


Area 52 => Turalyon
Stormrage => Turalyon
Tichondrius => Blackrock
Illidan => Blackrock
Bleeding Hollow => Korgath
Darkspear => Korgath


The transfers will be announced on the front page once available.


Blizzard Customer Support Callback
Over the last few weeks, we’ve launched a new callback-based system for players who need phone support. This is a big change from our traditional phone support, so we wanted to provide some details about this service.

How does the callback system work?

Instead of calling a number and potentially waiting on hold for support, you’ll use the support site on Battle.net to request a callback.
You’ll enter information about your issue, along with your phone number.
A Game Master will give you a call back.


How does the callback system benefit me as a player?

You won’t have to navigate a phone menu or spend time on hold.
Since the support site collects critical details in advance like the answer to your security question, you’ll jump directly into problem solving.


What’s happening to Blizzard Customer Support’s existing phone numbers?

We’re transitioning to a point where our phone lines will no longer present a menu system, but instead play a brief message directing users to the support site.


We hope you enjoy using the new service to get help when you need it!

Question: Visually, what was your favorite race pre-update, and has this changed whilst working on them?
Man, it's like picking your favorite kid - you curse the rest with low self-esteem and counseling bills Source https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/419616914189479937
Draenei for the women it's a tail thing Dwarves for the drinking and beards, Goblin when I'm being honest Source https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/419616396478144512

What tools/programs are most commonly used at blizzard and which is ur fav ? 
Photoshop, Max, Zbrush, and Maya. I'm a Photoshop fan for illustration/concept/texturing Max for modeling. Source https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/419614622702780416

Do Blizzard artists come with that art style already somewhat in place or develop it in house? Cheers 0/
awesome question, 80% pre-installed, 20% learned very roughly it took me a few months to adopt the style. Source https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/419217314496520192

By that I mean an item stored in the new Toy Box feature that you use an angel wings appear in your back.
Angelic wings are currently kind of a paladin thing. But who knows; lots of crazy toys get made! Source https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/419189879612768256

with character models/ possible subraces, any chance I can make a dwarf or panda that's not overweight? Or a fat Belf?
Dwarves & pandaren are JUST the right weight for dwarves & pandaren. How dare you, sir. HOW DARE YOU. Source https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/419189125892161537

PvP
Is Trial of the Gladiator just 3v3 and RBG?
Yes just 3v3 and RBG Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417500335435825152

what's your personal stance on separating pvp and pve entirely?
Hear this a lot & curious how people think it would work. So I'm killing a quest mob one second & a rogue jumps me, what happens? Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/418901857587568640
We already separate them to a large degree. PvP CC durations, base resilience, battle fatigue, PvP nerfs on specific spells, etc. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/418902045660180480
But in WoW, how my character behaves is my constant. It is just a question of what activity I'm doing with my character. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/418902521772396545

And they would only be used in Battlegrounds and PvP settings and "World PvP" would just happen in PvE specs and wouldn't matter.
Based on the response to how gear and World PvP has shaped up this expansion, I can't agree it wouldn't matter. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/418905869909123072
But I strongly dislike the idea of a PvP spec that only works in instanced PvP. That's a totally different game at that point. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/418906220703916032
I personally don't believe WoW is or ever was the right medium for PvP competition. That's not to say it can't be or hasn't been.
WoW is a big game & it's easy to become laser focused on a single part of it. PvP is quite broad but many only focus on arena Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/418908484407537664
I'd love it if WoW Arena was a separate game. There would be no excuse then not to make it as good as it can be.
It's debatable how many players you'd gain versus the ones you'd lose. I don't think we'll find out in WoW. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/418921748243828736

agree.. Very disappointing. You need to ahange your ‘last season/patch means no more major changes policy’
There is no such policy Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/419352660664258560

you guys dun goofed with baseline resilience on PvP servers. Have you and come up with any improvements for 6.0 ?
Base Resilience isn't the problem. PvP gear ilevels couldn't keep up with all of the new tiers of PvE gear in MoP. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/418152442681753600
We've changed our opinion about where PvP ilevels should fall next expac i.e. relatively higher. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/418152736866050048
Can you please ellaborate on that? Will PVE gear still outshine PVP gear in wPVP but lesser, or be equal or
Hard to elaborate on twitter. Think it would be better to get a blog or forum post to provide more info Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/419332283678461952

Future
So you could log onto a character and play while waiting for your other character's queue to pop?
I definitely see the appeal of that, but it comes with significant design and technical challenges that we'd have to solve. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/418584697455652864

What you guys think about Scaling down to old dungeons? Or old dungeon challenge modes?
I think it'd be amazing raids, too, and have been hoping we'd get it in for years. I still hope we get it in, ASAP. Source https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/418813279977218048

Warlords of Draenor Stats
if parry and dodge are gonna stop existing as status, what will happen to items gemmed with those statuses?
We'll likely replace dodge/parry on gear/gems/enchants with other stats. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/419668359005741056

Doesn't this mean the exponential scaling will continue and we'll need another squish? Why not all linear?
Linear power growth doesn't feel rewarding to players. You feel 100->120. You don't feel 500->520. You do feel 500->600. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/418890018346659841

PvP
What do you think about removing the cooldown on dispel in the near future?
We don't plan to remove it. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/419612519620038656

Any chance a votekick system similar to LFR can be put into random Battlegrounds? People who just troll chat sucks the fun out.
Yes, it would be a good addition going forward. It isn't planned for WoD release but it is something we should look into. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/418896322893058049

Okay, a more serious question for do you have any plans to adjust the WSG/AB rep grinds for the loss of Marks turnins for rep?
I'll have to investigate the reputation situation. In the age of Random Battlegrounds, I don't think it has been a priority. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/418069132068679680

Any chance that we can someday mail Honor and Justice between alts so an advanced main can help an alt gear up?
Prefer to do something like BoA "boost potions" or something that still requires you to play the character, just more efficiently Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/418068835929841664

Classes
Why bring a hunter over a warlock? Less DPS, Less utility, less AoE, less survivability. Any extra utility in WoD for hunters?
What you just described is a problem with Warlocks, not Hunters. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/418589763432488961

Future
Account-Wide Repuation, Sound like a good idea ?
There's internal debate. In the words of Nicol Williamson's Merlin: "A dream, to some. A NIGHTMARE TO OTHERS!!1!" Source https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/415267971699728384

Is Blizz happy with the social aspect of WoW? I sometimes find guilds are very lacking.
Specific opinions vary, internally, though everyone would like the social aspect - and every other aspect! - to improve. Source https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/415176328745209857
