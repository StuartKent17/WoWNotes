<br>
Warcraft Movie Presentation (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4485-Warcraft-Movie-Presentation)<br>
<br>
People actually at Blizzcon saw a short teaser trailer, but the video won&apos;t be released online (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/530887786233348096).<br>
The movie will follow heroes on both factions, &quot;50% Alliance, 50% Horde&quot;.<br>
The visual effects are very realistic. Motion capture was used, the team worked with ILM to make it feel as much like live action as possible.<br>
Effects are Avatar and Lord of the Rings at the same time.<br>
Very detailed sets were built, such as part of Stormwind&apos;s main street.<br>
A partial list of the cast was released.<br>
<br>

Heroes of the Storm Overview (http://www.heroesnexus.com/news/1238-blizzcon-2014-heroes-panel-live-update)<br>
<br>
Draft mode is coming, with no duplicate heroes and no bans.<br>
Ranked play is coming with two leagues: Hero league (any size group queue) and Team league (fixed size teams only). There are seasons, points, and a separate skill rank. <br>
Leavers - If you leave games too often, you will only be matched with other people that leave games too often. You can undo this by not leaving games.<br>
