Now that the models posted a few days ago have been confirmed as Tier 9, it&apos;s time for a small video preview of the Alliance Plate armor sets! The Horde Leather sets are also available in the game files but there are too many bugs for the moment to release a video, you&apos;ll have to wait for the next build.<br>
