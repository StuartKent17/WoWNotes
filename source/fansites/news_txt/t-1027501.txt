Mists of Pandaria Talent Calculator Now Available - New Skills Discovered!
As previously announced http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/blog/3773320/World_of_Warcraft_Class_Talent_System-10_21_2011#blog at BlizzCon 2011, class talents are undergoing some significant changes in the next World of Warcraft expansion. Learn more about these changes and test out different builds for all your favorite classes with our new Mists of Pandaria Talent Calculator, available here http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/mists-of-pandaria/feature/talent-calculator!

Weâ€™re excited to be able to provide players with the opportunity to explore this new talent system and look forward to hearing your feedback. As with all previews, we ask that you please keep in mind that Mists of Pandaria and its class talents are still under development. This means that many of the spells and abilities you see in the Talent Calculator are not yet final and may change before release.

This official calculator is full of surprises, spells have been updated since Blizzcon and new class spells appeared! Feel free to post anything new you might see in comments!
