MMO-Champion has been down for a couple of hours today, this is what you get when you outsource everything to gnome engineers. The site itself didn&apos;t have any problem, it was just an issue with .... some technical stuff that I can&apos;t explain. I just cried a lot and spammed my very comprehensive and skilled tech team and we&apos;re now back online. <br>
<br>
Or maybe it was all part of a bigger plan.<br>
<br>
<br>
Raidcomp Updated<br>
Raidcomp (http://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com/) has been updated to fix tons of outdated stuff. There are still a few bug fixes on the way, but it should look better!<br>
<br>
Armor % renamed to Physical Damage Reduction<br>
Damage % - Added Arcane Empowerment<br>
Damage Reduction % - Removed Grace, effect has been moved to Renewed Hope. <br>
Mana Regen (Pet) removed.<br>
Mana Regen renamed to just &quot;Mana Regen&quot;. Now includes Mana Spring Totem. <br>
Replenishment can now include Enduring Winter (Frost Mage)<br>
Attack Power reduction - Include Vindication for Protection Paladins<br>
Healing debuff - Fury Warriors&apos; &quot;Furious Attacks&quot; delegated to a &quot;maybe&quot;.<br>
Melee Hit Chance Reduction: Insect Swarm and Scorpid Sting are marked as &quot;maybe&quot; since Balance Druids will glyph out of it and Hunters will often use another sting.<br>
Hunter debuffs that are dependent on pets are declared as a &quot;maybe&quot;.<br>
Raid buff scrolls: Blessing of Kings, Mark of the Wild and Power Word: Fortitude as always marked as &quot;maybe&quot; once there are 1 or more of any class in the raid.<br>
<br>
There is a slight bug with tooltips not working properly on spells and a few other things, most of them should be fixed by the end of the day. <br>
