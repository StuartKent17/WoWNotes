Patch 3.2 BOP Items Trade<br>
A very nice feature was added to the game with the latest PTR patch, according to the interface files and a few in-game tests you can now trade BOP items with members of your raid who participated in the kill. This change will probably considerably lower the amount of GM petitions each day. <br>
<br>
BIND_TRADE_TIME_REMAINING = &quot;You may trade this item with players that were also eligible to loot this item for the next %s.&quot;; -- Time remaining to trade a bound item. Example: You may trade this item with players that were eligible to loot this item for the next 1 hour 30 minutes.<br>
