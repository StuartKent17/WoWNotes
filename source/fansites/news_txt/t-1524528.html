http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/us-en.png Free Faction Changes for Select Realms<br>
It looks like Blizzard is ready to try something new to address long battleground queues, starting with a test on US-Barthilas. <br>
<br>
As it stands, Barthilas has roughly 18.6k players with a Level 90 character on the realm. Around 14.7k of those characters are Horde and 3.9k are Alliance, resulting in a population that is 21% Alliance and 79% Horde.<br>
<br>
Looking at characters rather than players, there are ~41.7k Level 90 characters on Barthilas now, with 34.3k Horde and 7.4k Alliance, for a 17.8% Alliance and 82.2% Horde population.<br>
<br>
Holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka) also answered some common questions about the transfers on Twitter, noting that this isn&apos;t intended to solve the faction imbalance problem on many realms. <br>
<br>
Something to keep in mind about free faction transfers: The primary objective is to balance faction populations at the region level. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469164643781316608))<br>
Nice little attempt to give players corrective abilities to balance their own realms. Good luck on Mal&apos;Ganis...<br>
Again, the intention isn&apos;t to correct realm imbalances, but region imbalance. It&apos;s unlikely Tichondrius would become 50/50. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469184533573533697))<br>
Do you think starting with smaller realms to balance the regional overflow (not wanting ques) would work?<br>
We&apos;re starting with one server to ensure we can be responsive if anything unexpected occurs. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469191766793416706))<br>
What if you don&apos;t get good results? Will you try another server? And thank you for listening to us <br>
if things go well we will expand to other realms and regions. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469207846815428608))<br>
My question was if they don&apos;t go as expected on that one server, will you still try another?<br>
We started with one server to evaluate the process not player response. If the process works properly we will expand it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469214322053230592))<br>
<br>
what is the incentive though? why would anyone at this time choose to go to the side that lower pop, and lesser racial abilities?<br>
We&apos;re trying to remove barriers first. People faction transfer all the time. They may not need added incentive. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469167563536990208))<br>
<br>
So horde-&gt;alliance is probably all we are going to see initially?<br>
Yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469165044836466689))<br>
<br>
but what about when all the alliance go horde like they&apos;ve slowly been doing since faction change was implemented<br>
We aren&apos;t offering alliance to horde transfers for free. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469165237036277762))<br>
how is that helping to solve the alliance dominance on my server then? Horde is dead on my server ..<br>
it isn&apos;t meant to fix that problem (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469207711050383360))<br>
<br>
I wonder why they started with Barth? are we the guinea pig server? but I am excited. Ashran!!<br>
It was a good size and had a horde/alliance ratio we thought might attract faction changes. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469287666194726912))<br>
<br>
<br>
We consistently watch queue times for all areas of the game to try to identify problem areas where we can step in and make an improvement. Battleground queue times specifically tend to be a direct result of how many people are entering the queue at any given time from both the Horde and Alliance, within an entire region. While a number of factors can lead to longer queue times, faction interest in queuing for PvP tends to be the primary influence. For that reason we&apos;re going to be trying something new. For a limited time, and only for select realms (for this first test just a single realm), we&apos;ll be opening faction changes for Horde characters to change to Alliance for free.<br>
<br>
These changes will be provided on a limited basis to realms where we see the greatest potential for changes to occur. Guild leaders who want to Faction Change their guild for free will first need to pay for the initial transaction, but will be granted a refund* if they change to the eligible faction within the free change time frame.<br>
<br>
This first test of free faction changes will only initially be available to players on Barthilas. Eligible characters will be able to faction change from Horde to Alliance for approximately** one week beginning on Tuesday, May 27. If you&apos;re looking to faction change--and especially for any Guild leaders looking to initiate a Guild Master Faction Change (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/guild-master-realm-transfer-faction-change-procedure)--we highly recommend taking advantage of this offer as soon as possible to avoid leaving anyone behind. For more information on Faction Change eligibility and limitations, please visit the support site here (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/faction-change-basics-eligibility-and-limitations).<br>
<br>
We&apos;ll be providing updates on availability--as well as if this offer is extended to additional realms--here on the front page, so keep checking back. We look forward to your feedback on these faction changes, and ensuring you spend less time in a queue and more time slaughtering your enemies in glorious team-combat.<br>
<br>
* Eligible Guild Master Faction Change refunds will be automatically processed within 72 hours.<br>
**Faction Change availability may either be shortened or extended depending on ongoing evaluation during the faction change period.<br>

Isn&apos;t a talent that denies another talent bad design?<br>
The problem is when one talent mandates another. It&apos;s OK if *occasionally* two talents are incompatible. Still a choice. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467990817945051138))<br>
How is that a choice? I have the choice to pick a incompatible talent? ... not a choice at all<br>
I think you may have misread. The point is that you do still have a choice, between the other two talents. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467997723321331713))<br>
what if 2 or all 3 talents are penalized/incompatible/defeat the purpose? You have only 1 remaining.. or none<br>
Then that&apos;s a problem, as I said. We try to never do that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468001738801172481))<br>
and 75 talents, if you are not a BM hunter, you dont want any of that as its tuned around BM mastery.<br>
That&apos;s... not actually true, you realize? It doesn&apos;t matter if a row is stronger for one spec; row is still balanced. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468007886291861504))<br>

So Army is losing its Defensive properties then with it being instant or will blood gain a small defensive boost for short time?<br>
No; the 4sec of damage reduction is remaining. Yes, that&apos;s a buff, since it&apos;s no longer in lieu of being able to dodge/parry. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467820854563196928))<br>
<br>
BT Is the only option now in that tier and that is also passive as most people just macro it. That tier is illusion of choice.<br>
Are you a PvP-oriented Unholy DK? For every other combo that tier has some of the most talent diversity. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468572025510830080))<br>
I&apos;m a PvE raider. Every DW DK runs BT, 2H runs RE and so on. No choice there for PvE. Sorry I&apos;m just not seeing choice there<br>
Of Frost DKs who killed a boss in N/H SoO last week, here is the T5 talent breakdown: 43.93%, 29.81%, 26.26%. Guess which is which? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468576674385121281))<br>
The point here is that different people can view choice differently. Sometimes each might think theirs is the only &quot;right&quot; answer. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468577239391404032))<br>
I agree. The 43% is obviously BT, the other two are way low meaning they need help. Just spice them up so aren&apos;t so boring.<br>
The 43.93% is actually Runic Empowerment. Go figure, right? (BT pulls ahead if you look at Heroic exclusively, but it&apos;s still close.) (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468580214000189440))<br>
Can you see whats chose for raids or just &quot;who killed a boss&quot; &amp; &quot;what they have now&quot; independently? I switch for raids<br>
The former - can look at it boss-by-boss, or for BGs, or arenas, etc. As you say, it wouldn&apos;t be accurate otherwise. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468585751475539969))<br>
<br>
Will AMZ stay a talent for dks, when all other minor raid cooldowns are given to classes baseline?<br>
There are many talented forms of raid utility. It&apos;s actually a benefit to the class to be able to trade it for something... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468583999909031936))<br>
...else in the situation that it&apos;s not particularly useful. There are several talented raid utility abilities. Examples: ... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468584199633371136))<br>
Nature&apos;s Vigil, Heart of the Wild, Ancestral Guidance, Hand of Purity, Clemency, Sacred Shield, Safeguard, Vigilance, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468584610100543489))<br>
But then blood gets it, I thought you were removing all raid cds from tanks.<br>
A very fair question. We&apos;ve not reduced tanks to zero, just as much as we can without hitting talents. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468586993069215744))<br>
AMZ is more a raid CD than those types of utility though<br>
It&apos;s no more of a raid CD than Nature&apos;s Vigil or Chi Burst or Ancestral Guidance, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468587517998923776))<br>
Er, you might not have intended it that way but it&apos;s very much viewed (and assessed) as a raid CD by DKs today.<br>
Er, I&apos;m agreeing that it&apos;s a raid CD. And pointing out that there are many talented raid CDs; it&apos;s not unique in that regard. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468643181848825857))<br>
<br>
...Blood DKs feel that Purgatory is a must since it acts as a cheat death. That&apos;s huge for a spec like Blood.<br>
And AMZ isn&apos;t valuable during progression? It depends upon the fight; in many cases AMZ is better. Lichborne too (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468647401012465664))<br>
If you&apos;re seeing any DPS/Tank DKs take Lichborne widely in PvE, I&apos;d be very interested in hearing about it.<br>
I was referring to the 6.0 version of Lichborne. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468648158113718272))<br>
One quick question- is 6.0 Lichborne still a CD, or does the Leech have a passive component?<br>
Still 2min CD. I believe it&apos;s 15% Leech, offhand. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468652327553871872))<br>

If RoP is superior to MI or IF, we have to use it. Just like LB &gt; NT for single target now, even if I hate LB I have to use it.<br>

Worth considering, but how mandatory it is may significantly change in WoD; waiting to see. Regardless &quot;Mandatory-&gt;Baseline&quot;... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467790338208198657))<br>
...is generally a thought process that glosses over the fact that that&apos;s a net buff to the class. Easy mistake to make. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467790864190672897))<br>
Wtb hints on arms changes<br>
Hint: Less complexity. More depth. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467793163340378112))<br>
I call foul, you gave us that hint already a few days ago. Give us a new hint!<br>
Wouldn&apos;t it be cool if you had a Mastery that accentuated your spec&apos;s flavor, instead of fought against it? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467861391555059712))<br>
<br>
Will prot mastery benefit gladiator stance at all?<br>
Yes; mastery grants +%AP for tanks. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468705312891891712))<br>
About this, will Mastery&apos;s AP scaling for tanks be tuned differently for each tank?<br>
If needbe. So far, no, but we haven&apos;t fine-tuned performance yet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468874289769627650))<br>

Do you think we can have full spell effects out in the world and only diminish them in raid environments?<br>
That&apos;s the plan (other than in large concentrations of players even outdoors, such as Ashran). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468643525651730434))<br>

Character / Items<br>
What was the reasoning behind necks, rings, and cloaks not changing stats in 6.0? I get how weapons and trinkets have a ...<br>
It&apos;s good for loot distribution, competition, variety, and interest, for different items to be valuable to different people. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468642050749906944))<br>
Had they changed stats, a given ring would be useful to everyone of a role. Rings that 2/3 of the raid rolls on... CC: @olandgren (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468642554355793920))<br>
<br>
Is there any intention to help alts with upgrades? Will take 4 months to upgrade a full gearset with a weekly 1k valor cap.<br>
The increase is mainly to let already-capped players continue progressing. If your gear is unupgraded you don&apos;t have that issue. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468815181401702403))<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br>
With the upcoming stat squish, will we feel weaker when soloing old raid content compared to how it is now?<br>
No, not at all. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467299908869832704))<br>
<br>
You mentioned that necks, ring etc with spirit will be useless for dps in 6.0. Same for mail gear? Will be super annoying as ele<br>
Nope. Mail gear will not have Spirit on it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467306891966967808))<br>
<br>
will secondary stats weigh equally for each spec so we can stack what we think is more fun, not which is &quot;more dps&quot;?<br>
We don&apos;t aim for perfect equality (and that that&apos;s not even feasible most of the time). But, we are aiming for much closer. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467320177445457921))<br>
<br>
Can trinket procs or weapon enchants multi-strike? Or is multi-strike focused on player abilties.<br>
If you&apos;re referring to ones that do damage, such as Elemental Force, yes, the damage can Multistrike. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468588506197925888))<br>
However something like Jade Spirit cannot. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468588638393995264))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Is the new recharging rez system for flexible difficulties only or mythic too?<br>
For all difficulties - a Mythic raid will be treated the same as a 20-player Normal/Heroic raid. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/467736988964376576))<br>
<br>
Kind of puzzled at the LFR Garrosh timer increase as opposed to a health reduction. 18+ minute LFR fight is a little long, no?<br>
Vast majority of LFR Garrosh kills are well short of that, but if you made it that far, a sub-10% zerk wipe is the worst thing. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468780542520197120))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Thoughts about honor from bgs after the buff? It still feels like it&apos;s WAY too little honor for how much you need on a new toon.<br>
Dunno, just geared up a toon and felt really fast (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/467328162762747904))<br>
Sounds like you have alot of toons Holinka, trying all classes?<br>
yup (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/467328935726809088))<br>
<br>
Are there any plans to change fear in WoD? I&apos;m tired of it not breaking and I die in it<br>
they&apos;re 2 seconds shorter (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/467379282507886593))<br>
<br>
Thoughts on Flex RBGs? Would help my guild, but I can understand balance concerns.<br>
Flex is a great idea for PvE content. Fixed size is pretty necessary for PvP. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/468772809926520832))<br>
<br>
What&apos;s your opinion on &quot;Prideful Conquest&quot; being account-wide. The catch up is brutal for most people.<br>
I&apos;ve done the catchup myself through pugs several times. I think it works great. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/468772621899689984))<br>
And then you&apos;re still behind on gear.<br>
The intention isn&apos;t to catch all the way up. Playing consistently should have an advantage. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/468773797877665792))<br>
I guess you&apos;re right. I guess I&apos;m just the minority that feels rated PvP shouldn&apos;t be an uneven playing field.<br>
there others with that opinion. I think WoW strikes a good balance. There is progression but fairly easy to get to full gear. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/468777869561184256))<br>
<br>
UI / Addons<br>
Random question, but is there a particular reason that there is no cooldown text on action bar buttons by default?<br>
It&apos;s an option in 6.0. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468630422134349824))<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor<br>
Will we ever see better in game testing tools? Even better/more target dummy options would be REALLY nice.<br>
We&apos;re working on some options for alpha/beta, but nothing I can promise. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468705495591579648))<br>
