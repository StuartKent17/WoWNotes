Today Nihilum (http://www.nihilum.co.uk) reached 25% health on her. <br>
If the hotfix made it easier, can we expect a kill soon from Death and Taxes if they manage to clean the whole instance after their downtime ? Stay tuned, i&apos;m sure we&apos;ll hear about a world first kill soon.<br>
<br>
Update : This isn&apos;t officially confirmed but it seems that Lady Vashj&apos;s adds have been nerfed from 340 000 HP to 145 000. The hotfix is already applied to EU servers.<br>
