WoW Token Disabled<br>
I&apos;ve just learned that we&apos;ve disabled WoW Tokens for the time being - this is intentional, and not a bug, but is being looked into.<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t have details to share on the &apos;why&apos; or the &apos;when will they be back&apos; questions you inevitably have, but I&apos;ll update you as I can.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your patience!<br>

Patch 7.2.5 PTR - Build Deploy Delayed<br>

Patch 7.2.5 - Arms/Fury and Draught of Souls Changes<br>

Arms/Fury and Draught of Souls<br>
For Arms and Fury Warriors, we&#x2019;re going to scale down the damage of Draught of Souls in the next build for the 7.2.5 PTR.<br>
<br>
Specifically, we&#x2019;re aiming for a roughly 40% reduction in the effectiveness of Draught of Souls. For those two specs, it&#x2019;s a trinket that is extremely valuable due to its interaction with Battle Cry. We&#x2019;ve already tuned other forthcoming on-use trinkets that drop in Tomb of Sargeras for Arms and Fury with the same modifier to compensate for Battle Cry&#x2019;s effectiveness in boosting trinkets of this kind. Our goal is for new trinkets to have more similar power levels between various specs, while leaving Draught of Souls in a place where it remains competitive for Arms and Fury.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re making sure to consider this trinket change as we update Warriors in Patch 7.2.5. With this in mind, Fury damage has been increased by 5% across the board. Arms is currently in the middle of receiving some heavy mechanical changes which will require a deeper look into their overall performance, and we&#x2019;ll account for this change when we do our final tuning. <br>
<br>
We don&#x2019;t want Draught of Souls to define DPS Warriors for the remainder of the expansion, but we do want Warriors who have one to be able to make good use of it as they progress through Tomb of Sargeras.<br>
<br>
Thank you for all of your feedback!<br>
