Timewarped 2H Caster Weapon Hotfix<br>
It appears that the Timewarped 2H Weapon spellpower hotfix has come undone with 6.2.2a, as the spellpower on these weapons was reduced again today. <br>
Timewalking 2-handed caster weapons now have bonus Spell Power equal to that of 1-handed caster weapons. <br>

Blue Tweets<br>
Like how the emerald drake made sense? If it&apos;s via achievement, it really doesn&apos;t need any context.<br>
.I&apos;d argue that while this is true, it&apos;s so cool and iconic that efforts should be made to make it fit a story/event. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/641648296402878464))<br>
Makes perfect sense for a TIMEWALKING mount. Complete all time walking dungeons or something.<br>
TW is a good vehicle, but I think you could do more, eg hidden infinite rares in TW dung&apos;s up to no good. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/641650352052244480))<br>
