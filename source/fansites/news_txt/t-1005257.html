Blizzcon Interview Details<br>
A few interviews of Blizzard staff have popped up so far, the interesting parts are below. We are likely to see more early next week. (via venturebeat (http://venturebeat.com/2011/10/22/blizzard-coo-paul-sams-talks-mobile-games-and-giving-away-diablo-iii-for-free/), gaming-insight (http://www.gaming-insight.de/wow/538-Blizzcon-2011-Live-Video-Opening-Ceremony-and-Interview-mit-Greg-Ghostcrawler-Street&amp;usg=ALkJrhg9cQ3K86t2RM6AzJN4IzusMY4RpA))<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You might be able to use Valor Points to increase the item level of your items slightly.<br>
Blizzard might move your Resource bars closer to the center of the screen, similar to how many custom UIs are set up. It will start with Monks, then maybe Paladins and Death Knights.<br>
The game will almost always be sold with Burning Crusade in the future to cut down on the number of games you have to buy.<br>
If WoW was ever on the decline to where subscriptions were not high enough to support the game, they would consider the freemium model. <br>
