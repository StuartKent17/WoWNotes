According to a new article on Kotaku , rumor has it Blizzard canceled a StarCraft first-person shooter that has been in development for the past two years. Click the banner below to read the full article and Blizzard's response to it.


 


The cancellation was made in order to focus on Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2.
The canceled project was code-named Ares.
It was described as being similar to the Battlefield franchise, but in the StarCraft Universe.
According to sources, it was a massive shock that Blizzard canceled it as it was "looking quite good."
Nobody has been laid off as a result of the cancellation, but moved to the upcoming Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2.
Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2 are expected to be announced at Blizzcon in the fall.
Overwatch 2 is rumored to have a large PvE element, and has been compared to Left 4 Dead.
Ares started as an experiment to do something with StarCraft on the Overwatch engine.
Blizzard has wanted to move as many games as possible to the same technology as the Overwatch engine to be more efficient.
Dustin Browder, who led Heroes of the Storm and StarCraft II, was supposed to be the director of the project.
