Boubouille2007-06-05, 10:03 PMOk, finally got something. 

Curse http://www.curse-guild.org is currently fighting Illidan, and are progressing through the phases quite well it seems. 
How would I know ? Earlier tonight, I tried to query the itemID of the Twin Blade main hand on Vek'nilash, where Curse plays, it didn't work.
Few minutes ago, I tried again ... and here you go. Twin Blades of Azzinoth !

We can now fairly assume that the item is needed by NPCs on the encounter, which means we won't get the stats of the off-hand anytime soon. 
The stats on this one are real, because the itemID is the same as the one used in the player set included in the game files.
