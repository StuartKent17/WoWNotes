Warlords of Draenor - Tier 17 Warrior Armor Sets
Today we are taking a look at the Tier 17 Warrior armor sets.

Warlords of Draenor changes things up slightly by using one set of art for Raid Finder, one set of art for Normal and Heroic, and one set of art for Mythic difficulty. You can find the Raid Finder armor sets in our Raid Finder armor sets preview http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3940-Warlords-of-Draenor-Raid-Finder-Armor-Sets-Draenei-Guard-Armor-Set-Blue-Tweets-Art.

Conquest Catch Up Cap
The formula is weeks in the season - 1 * 1000 + 1800 arena cap - conquest earned this season 

So to use your example, your cap is 14800 now because it's the 14th week of the season and you haven't earned any conquest yet.

Let's say you win 20 games 3600 conquest before the weekly reset. Your cap on Tuesday is going to be

14 * 1000 + 1800 - 3600 = 12200
Ayani is mostly correct. One tiny correction to the order things are calculated, for those who might be interested in the math:

Weeks in the season - 1 * 1000 - Conquest earned this season = catch up cap
Catch up cap + Arena/RBG cap based on rating = total amount of Conquest you can earn this week

Also: the catch up cap doesn't "reset" if you don't work through it all in one week. Feel free to chip away at it when you have time 

Real quick before you run off lore, the debate was whether you continue gaining the catch up cap if you "chip into it" as you put it 
Short answer: yes.

Long answer: The catch-up cap is re-calculated from scratch on a weekly basis. It's not that you're earning an extra 1000 points of catch-up cap every week, it's that you're being awarded an amount based on how many weeks the season has been running. It's a minor difference in approach but an important one, as it means there isn't anything to "lose" or "not gain" to begin with.

To put it another way: every week, you will have 1000 Conquest points for every week except the first added to your cap, minus the total number of Conquest points you've earned for the season. If it's week 14 and you've earned 3000 Conquest points already this season, you'll have 10,000 added to your weekly cap. That's done regardless of when you earned those 3000 points.

Why is being GCD capped worse than being resources capped? More actions per minute = more fun for me
Because it removes timing from the gameplay choices you can make, for the most part. Pooling is a great form of gameplay for some. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470804470087950336
That's why we try to provide a mix of different playstyles; some GCD-capped, some not. Something for everyone, hopefully. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470804580008075264

One last Q: If Mana-using DPS are built to NEVER run oom doing damage, why have mana instd of special resource 4 utility skills?
Because not everyone needs to have a special resource. Time is a very effective resource. Just different types of gameplay. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470785785424125952
I have to say I dislike that logic. What is the point of mana if it's an arbitrary blue bar that serves no purpose?
It doesn't serve *no* purpose, it just doesn't serve as a limit on DPS. It usually limits utility/offhealing. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470807628738617345

No need. The visuals were merged too. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470749180928212993
Can we get his animation back? https://t.co/siA80h8tif

focus due to capping from time casting. Did I calculate anything wrong?
Sounds right. Focusing Shot is/will be tuned to expect *some* amount of wasted focus. This sounds like one unavoidable case. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470714644517376000
Steady, focusing, cobra - is there really a point to the difference between steady and cobra now that sting is SV?
How much the spec's damage is mitigated by Armor and other physical damage reduction. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470718386272755713

IE, steady focus + weapon focus marksman flavour, serpent sting + magic mastery survival... BM wat
Well, at the end of the day, BM is about beasts, and Cobra Shot *does* shoot a cobra. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470728718508650497

with SV being magical based dmg, why introduce bear trap which is a bleed. That seems MM oriented.
Traps are more closely linked to Survival than magic damage is. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470781306742140928

Holy Nova takes what position for Disc? AOE healing? Spot spam for fun?
Efficient AoE healing. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470761266265337856

ty, another question was whether the new HN will be similar to current one, in terms of cast time etc
Yes, still instant. Much stronger healing effectiveness. Radius is a little bigger, too. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470761453448753152
what about damage? about the same?
Damage still about the same very minor. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470762028844339201

Void Entropy. Designed for when we have too many orbs and DP is not enough to spend? Or will it provide more dmg/orb than DP?
Way more dmg/orb that DP. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470778383081562113
About DP, thread on Clarity talent on mmo-champ say's eventually mastery will make MS spam out do DP:I. What are your thoughts?
We think that it's a valid concern we're going to watch for when we get to the tuning phase, and make adjustments if necessary. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470804203758051328

You mentioned that Enhance would do more active dps, but most spells do reduced % of wep damage now, higher % white as a result?

Set bonuses will benefit Gladiators. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470778020802748416

The problem is losing all those SD procs for CS to occupy rage free, damaging GCD's. Losing OP hurts as well.
What SD procs were lost? I'd double-check your theorycraft. From experience, in blues in 6.0 Arms, I'm easily GCD capped,... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470780468212690944
...and able to replace some of them with Execute. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470780565256278016

Will Gladiator Stance still be able to have access to Rallying Cry/Demo Banner? Or since tech. Prot lose utility?
No; that's an intended weakness of Gladiator; light on the raid utility. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470781138357600257

Any chance we could be able to change how guns sound on our own client? I love the models but the sound gives me a headache.
Guns have new sounds in 6.0. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470273120041848833

Character / Items
serious question. How many shamans do you see with shields? You do allow them to use staff and off hands....
The vast vast majority. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470749313807953920
Why is the 1st Garrosh heirloom that caster Shaman receive set to be the staff then?
It's not. It's 50/50 staff/mace, because both are usable weapons. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/470752533179539456

Warlords of Draenor Stats
why does it say Multistrike and Readiness changed? They look the same - what am I missing?
Added descriptions of both, and changed Multistrike to be "2 X% rolls" instead of "2 X/2% rolls". Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469914564503801856
so is it correct to assume it now caps at 100%? Just syntax, really
Correct. No functional change, just more understandable, hopefully. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469924450301800448

amplify not mentioned as a secondary stat, does it still exist or was it scrapped?
Postponed. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469931369745756160

Im curious. Why did you guys not go even lower with the stat squish? Like back to vanilla levels for example.
That's exactly what we did, actually 1-60 was linear progression. We extended that same linearity up to 90. Health was doubled. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470777885288955904

PvE
can you please prevent people with ressurrection sickness from joining LFR?
I think the underlying issue there is that res sickness is probably too punitive at this point. We'll evaluate. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/470713230395207681

Glad to hear you can get gear from them. But CMs do still focus on time trial, and have downscaled gear
True, though the gear reward is for completion; speed run for cosmetic perks. And early on downscaling won't be felt at all. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/470952559734435840

Is there any reason the LFR philosophy hasn't been applied to LFD? ie LFD easy, norm/hero/myth harder w/ no random groups
Challenge mode is the "no random groups" hard version of dungeons. And now you can get some epic gear from doing them. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/470950565032505344
Really just want more options for dungeons like there are for raids.
Totally understand. Heroics with a Silver Proving Ground requirement to queue are a bit of a middle ground, at least. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/470952664768217088

More relevant question: How are you going to handle the new Role Summary tab of the Dungeon Journal? Unlock after some time?
Why would it need to be locked at all? The point is to offer a tl;dr overview that's easier to absorb than the full Abilities list. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/470951070379020288
Using Garrosh as a preview: I don't like that it just tells you exactly everything to do. Video games should be about learning.
It doesn't tell you to clump for MC; nor to make sure 30% of your raid stands out to position Weapons, etc. It's not about strat. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/471053654754336769
A fight might have 10 different abilities; the aim is to call out the 3 or so most important things for your role. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/471053943007891456

Warlords of Draenor
Why so much transparency in this Alpha? Other Alpha's were more tight lipped. Not that I mind it, it's awesome to see.
We thought we could do better. The community interaction is valuable, from many angles. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469912253945634816
