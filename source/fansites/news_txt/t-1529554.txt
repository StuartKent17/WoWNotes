Conquest Catch Up Cap
The formula is weeks in the season - 1 * 1000 + 1800 arena cap - conquest earned this season 

So to use your example, your cap is 14800 now because it's the 14th week of the season and you haven't earned any conquest yet.

Let's say you win 20 games 3600 conquest before the weekly reset. Your cap on Tuesday is going to be

14 * 1000 + 1800 - 3600 = 12200
Ayani is mostly correct. One tiny correction to the order things are calculated, for those who might be interested in the math:

Weeks in the season - 1 * 1000 - Conquest earned this season = catch up cap
Catch up cap + Arena/RBG cap based on rating = total amount of Conquest you can earn this week

Also: the catch up cap doesn't "reset" if you don't work through it all in one week. Feel free to chip away at it when you have time 

Real quick before you run off lore, the debate was whether you continue gaining the catch up cap if you "chip into it" as you put it 
Short answer: yes.

Long answer: The catch-up cap is re-calculated from scratch on a weekly basis. It's not that you're earning an extra 1000 points of catch-up cap every week, it's that you're being awarded an amount based on how many weeks the season has been running. It's a minor difference in approach but an important one, as it means there isn't anything to "lose" or "not gain" to begin with.

To put it another way: every week, you will have 1000 Conquest points for every week except the first added to your cap, minus the total number of Conquest points you've earned for the season. If it's week 14 and you've earned 3000 Conquest points already this season, you'll have 10,000 added to your weekly cap. That's done regardless of when you earned those 3000 points.

Hope that helps clarify Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Why is being GCD capped worse than being resources capped? More actions per minute = more fun for me
Because it removes timing from the gameplay choices you can make, for the most part. Pooling is a great form of gameplay for some. Celestalon 
That's why we try to provide a mix of different playstyles; some GCD-capped, some not. Something for everyone, hopefully. Celestalon 

One last Q: If Mana-using DPS are built to NEVER run oom doing damage, why have mana instd of special resource 4 utility skills?
Because not everyone needs to have a special resource. Time is a very effective resource. Just different types of gameplay. Celestalon 
I have to say I dislike that logic. What is the point of mana if it's an arbitrary blue bar that serves no purpose?
It doesn't serve *no* purpose, it just doesn't serve as a limit on DPS. It usually limits utility/offhealing. Celestalon 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Any chance to see minor glyph that turns pestilence icon, visual and sound effects into blood boil ones?
No need. The visuals were merged too. Celestalon 
Can we get his animation back? 
No, I don't think we're using a 10x size, red-tinted Banish visual. It might be new, don't recall. Celestalon 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
focus due to capping from time casting. Did I calculate anything wrong?
Sounds right. Focusing Shot is/will be tuned to expect *some* amount of wasted focus. This sounds like one unavoidable case. Celestalon 
Steady, focusing, cobra - is there really a point to the difference between steady and cobra now that sting is SV?
How much the spec's damage is mitigated by Armor and other physical damage reduction. Celestalon 

IE, steady focus + weapon focus marksman flavour, serpent sting + magic mastery survival... BM wat
Well, at the end of the day, BM is about beasts, and Cobra Shot *does* shoot a cobra. Celestalon 

with SV being magical based dmg, why introduce bear trap which is a bleed. That seems MM oriented.
Traps are more closely linked to Survival than magic damage is. Celestalon 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Holy Nova takes what position for Disc? AOE healing? Spot spam for fun?
Efficient AoE healing. Celestalon 

ty, another question was whether the new HN will be similar to current one, in terms of cast time etc
Yes, still instant. Much stronger healing effectiveness. Radius is a little bigger, too. Celestalon 
what about damage? about the same?
Damage still about the same very minor. Celestalon 

Void Entropy. Designed for when we have too many orbs and DP is not enough to spend? Or will it provide more dmg/orb than DP?
Way more dmg/orb that DP. Celestalon 
About DP, thread on Clarity talent on mmo-champ say's eventually mastery will make MS spam out do DP:I. What are your thoughts?
We think that it's a valid concern we're going to watch for when we get to the tuning phase, and make adjustments if necessary. Celestalon 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
You mentioned that Enhance would do more active dps, but most spells do reduced % of wep damage now, higher % white as a result?
We also reduced weapon damage by 50%. Celestalon 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Would like to know how do Glad Wars work with set bonuses? Are we considered melee under boss mechanics or tanks? explain pls
Set bonuses will benefit Gladiators. Celestalon 

The problem is losing all those SD procs for CS to occupy rage free, damaging GCD's. Losing OP hurts as well.
What SD procs were lost? I'd double-check your theorycraft. From experience, in blues in 6.0 Arms, I'm easily GCD capped,... Celestalon 
...and able to replace some of them with Execute. Celestalon 

Will Gladiator Stance still be able to have access to Rallying Cry/Demo Banner? Or since tech. Prot lose utility?
No; that's an intended weakness of Gladiator; light on the raid utility. Celestalon 

Art
Any chance we could be able to change how guns sound on our own client? I love the models but the sound gives me a headache.
Guns have new sounds in 6.0. Celestalon 

Character / Items
serious question. How many shamans do you see with shields? You do allow them to use staff and off hands....
The vast vast majority. Celestalon 
Why is the 1st Garrosh heirloom that caster Shaman receive set to be the staff then?
It's not. It's 50/50 staff/mace, because both are usable weapons. WatcherDev 

Warlords of Draenor Stats
why does it say Multistrike and Readiness changed? They look the same - what am I missing?
Added descriptions of both, and changed Multistrike to be "2 X% rolls" instead of "2 X/2% rolls". Celestalon 
so is it correct to assume it now caps at 100%? Just syntax, really
Correct. No functional change, just more understandable, hopefully. Celestalon 

amplify not mentioned as a secondary stat, does it still exist or was it scrapped?
Postponed. Celestalon 

Im curious. Why did you guys not go even lower with the stat squish? Like back to vanilla levels for example.
That's exactly what we did, actually 1-60 was linear progression. We extended that same linearity up to 90. Health was doubled. Celestalon 

PvE
can you please prevent people with ressurrection sickness from joining LFR?
I think the underlying issue there is that res sickness is probably too punitive at this point. We'll evaluate. WatcherDev 

Glad to hear you can get gear from them. But CMs do still focus on time trial, and have downscaled gear
True, though the gear reward is for completion; speed run for cosmetic perks. And early on downscaling won't be felt at all. WatcherDev 

Is there any reason the LFR philosophy hasn't been applied to LFD? ie LFD easy, norm/hero/myth harder w/ no random groups
Challenge mode is the "no random groups" hard version of dungeons. And now you can get some epic gear from doing them. WatcherDev 
Really just want more options for dungeons like there are for raids.
Totally understand. Heroics with a Silver Proving Ground requirement to queue are a bit of a middle ground, at least. WatcherDev 

More relevant question: How are you going to handle the new Role Summary tab of the Dungeon Journal? Unlock after some time?
Why would it need to be locked at all? The point is to offer a tl;dr overview that's easier to absorb than the full Abilities list. WatcherDev 
Using Garrosh as a preview: I don't like that it just tells you exactly everything to do. Video games should be about learning.
It doesn't tell you to clump for MC; nor to make sure 30% of your raid stands out to position Weapons, etc. It's not about strat. WatcherDev 
A fight might have 10 different abilities; the aim is to call out the 3 or so most important things for your role. WatcherDev 

Warlords of Draenor
Why so much transparency in this Alpha? Other Alpha's were more tight lipped. Not that I mind it, it's awesome to see.
We thought we could do better. The community interaction is valuable, from many angles. Celestalon
