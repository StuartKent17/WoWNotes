Spell Visual Updates
Thank you to everyone who spent their time and energy playtesting on the PTR, providing constructive feedback, and putting many more eyes on our class visual updates for 7.3.

This round of updates has come to a close, and we have much more planned for the future. While significant strides were made for this patch, some spell updates had promise, but didn’t quite hit the mark and we’ve taken them back to the drawing board. Our initiative to update visuals and effects, especially regarding combat, carries on. Your feedback has helped us guide our priorities going forward. 

Thank you once again! Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1066894-feedback-shaman-spell-visual-updates/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20757667230?page=7#139

Legion Season 3 and 4 Ensembles
Thanks for your patience while this was worked on. The Legion Season 3 and 4 ensembles should now be available from the vendors in Dalaran.

Total noob question. Where exactly do I find the PvP vendors for Alliance?
At the back of Greyfang Enclave in Dalaran. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1070530-did-blizzard-forgot-about-eu-pvp-vendors/ / Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17616702827?page=12#232

Nethershard Essence will be necessary for crafting legendary in 7.3? If yes, is possible to buy in the new vendor in 7.3? 
Warmage Kathleen has been licensed as an approved reseller of this item in 7.3. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/901247413096140800

Can we get loot from each boss per week in the greater invasion points or only 1 boss per week out of all the bosses?
Only one Greater Invasion Point boss is active each week. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/901247750217490433

Can a worgen turn partially for a short amount of time? Or is it unstoppable when it starts? Hold a worgen hand alone -briefly-?

Patch 7.3: Shadows of Argus Art Contest
Throughout time, artists have set their talents to capturing pivotal moments in history. To commemorate the grandest of crusades for Azeroth’s heroes, we’re asking you to bring forth your talents to encapsulate the campaign into Argus. Let the fel* of your creativity flow using pens, pencil, paints, or your favorite art program to capture the events, people, and environs of the Shadows of Argus for posterity… and prizes.

We’re looking for your best Argus themed artwork either with traditional media or via digital media.

First Place: Three qualified entrants will be chosen and receive one World of Warcraft: Legion Collector’s Edition signed by the World of Warcraft Art Team and one Starseeker Pet and Mount Bundle. Runner-Ups: Ten qualified entrants will be chosen to receive one Starseeker Pet and Mount Bundle.

Entries can be submitted during the period of August 30 through September 30, 2017 to CommunityContestsNA@blizzard.com. Each submission must be a high-resolution JPEG file of no more than 5MB in size to be considered for the contest. A submission must be your original work, and cannot include, in whole or part, any previously created work.

You can find the full contest rules here.

Good luck in your artistic journey!

*You may need a bit of green – perhaps some purples too, but definitely green. Use fel responsibly. May cause itching, skin pigmentation changes and irritation, general hunger, and sudden feelings of world domination. Do not use without warlock or demon hunter supervision. Do not use fel and operate heavy machinery. Warnings aside, we’re sure it will all be fine.
