<br>
(PvP) Holy Word: Chastise will no longer remove periodic damaging effects from targets in PvE situations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeons<br>
<br>
Black Rook Hold<br>
<br>
Fel Vomit from the Smashspite the Hateful encounter in Black Rook Hold will no longer persist after the encounter is defeated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
The secondary stats on Legion gems have been significantly decreased.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: Gems are not in the same place as they were in previous expansions. They&#x2019;re a bit too powerful, and this was not intended. Sockets are still quite valuable and will continue to be so, but we need to reduce the difference between an item having a socket vs. not having a socket.<br>
<br>
