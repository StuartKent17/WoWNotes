Tier 20 Tuning, pre-Tomb of Sargeras<br>

Note that this is the round of Tier 20 tuning we&apos;re doing before Tomb opens, and we may make further adjustments as needed once Tomb opens and we have more live data.<br>

Havoc Discussions - 7.2.5 Mechanics and Feel<br>
Thank you for all the feedback, and apologies for the delayed response.<br>
<br>
We agree that there are moments of frustration with the live version of Demon Blades, and are continuing to look into how to address them, but also think that a smooth resource income is not the best solution.<br>
<br>
For Havoc, we wanted to create a style of play that used fewer core abilities in favor of having deeper gameplay in other areas (e.g. a higher reliance on movement and battlefield awareness, and higher variation in resource generation). Part of what makes Demon&apos;s Bite, a spammable resource generator, work for Havoc is that its interaction with Chaos Strike is not static. You need to monitor how much Fury it generates, and react with Chaos Strike when appropriate.<br>
<br>
We tried out having Demon Blades at 100% on the PTR mostly as a quality of life change, and to reduce the periods of time where players running Demon Blades found themselves unable to use any abilities. However, in practice, that change took an already simplified rotation and made it almost completely predictable. Though effective, it made the spec very dull to play. Reacting to your Fury bar is a core aspect of Havoc gameplay, and we don&apos;t want to lose that gameplay with Demon Blades.<br>
<br>
All that said, we still agree that the current version of Demon Blades is not perfect, and we will continue to iterate. The version we tried on the 7.2.5 PTR was just not the right direction for Havoc.</div></div>
