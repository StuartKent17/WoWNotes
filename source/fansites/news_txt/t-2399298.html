Blizzard recently made an adjustment to what artifact appearances are going away in Battle for Azeroth. The appearance awarded for completing a Mythic +15 will now still be obtainable after Legion ends. This means that only the Mage Tower base artifact appearances will no longer be available to unlock in Battle for Azeroth.<br>
As testing continues in the Battle for Azeroth Beta, and we specifically consider the transition from Legion to BFA, we&#x2019;ve decided to make the existing Keystone Master achievement permanent. There will not be a new achievement for completing a Mythic 15 or higher dungeon in the new expansion.<br>
<br>
The artifact appearance associated with Keystone Master will still be available in Battle For Azeroth. Players can earn the achievement in Legion through August 13, or players can complete a Mythic 15 BFA dungeon at level 120, once Mythic Keystone difficulty opens a few weeks after the launch of Battle For Azeroth.<br>
<br>
This means that the only artifact appearance that will become unobtainable with Battle For Azeroth is the Mage Tower base appearance.<br>
<br>
As always, thank you for your feedback!</div></div>
