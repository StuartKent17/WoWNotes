New Raid: Crucible of Storms<br>
A long submerged evil stirs beneath the Shrine of the Storm. The whispers that drove Lord Stormsong to madness echo within the depths, a siren song of eldritch power. Those who listen and obey prepare dark rituals to carry out their master&#x2019;s will. Whatever nightmarish schemes fuel their fantastical devotion, one thing is certain: they must be stopped.<br>
