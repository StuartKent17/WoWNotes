Patch 2.2.2 going live on Tuesday/Wednesday<br>
Daghorn, a french community representative confirmed in this post (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=1016342728&amp;sid=2) that the Brewfest will start on October 3rd. This event cannot start without the 2.2.2 patch and it means that we&apos;ll be getting it Tuesday in the US and Wednesday in Europe.<br>
<br>
New PvP items in 2.3<br>
New cloaks, even if the healing wand (see below) is confirmed for the Season 3, these one are just confirmed for 2.3 and they could be released sooner. (but it&apos;s unlikely in my opinion, see the explanation below)<br>
<br>
<br>
[Melee DPS Cloak]<br>
+34 Stamina<br>
+20 Critical Strike rating<br>
+20 Resilience rating<br>
+46 Attack Power<br>
+112 Armor Penetration<br>
<br>
[Caster DPS Cloak]<br>
+34 Stamina<br>
+15 Intellect<br>
+16 Spell Critical rating<br>
+23 Resilience<br>
+27 Spell Damage/Heal<br>
<br>
There&apos;s a PvP healing cloak in patch 2.3. The vital stats are...<br>
[Healer PvP Cloak]<br>
+34 Stamina<br>
+15 Intellect<br>
+6 Mana/5 Sec (was +16 Spell Critical Strike rating but got changed after a post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1762876473&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=4#77)<br>
+23 Resilience rating<br>
+51 Healing / +17 Spell Damage (Because of the 33% spell damage bonus)<br>
<br>
There is also a hunter weapon revealed in the same post.<br>
<br>
[Vengeful Gladiator&apos;s Waraxe]<br>
+62 Stamina<br>
+46 Critical Strike rating<br>
+33 Resilience rating<br>
+15 Hit rating<br>
+92 Attack Power<br>
+98 Armor Penetration<br>
<br>
Cost: 1000 arena points (no rating requirement)<br>
<br>
The following is pure speculation, but this weapon isn&apos;t labeled as &quot;Merciless Gladiator&quot;, Vengeful could be the new Season 3 prefix and it would also confirm that the previous PvP cloaks are also scheduled for Season 3.<br>
<br>
Kalgan also explains why they&apos;re adding these new items.<br>
Early on we had a philosophy that we wouldn&apos;t put tanking gear or full sets of healing gear on the pvp vendors since at the time there were concerns that players would feel like it was advantageous to pvp in order to get gear to beat raid content.<br>
<br>
Turns out that philosophy mostly sucked (although we&apos;re holding onto the no-tanking gear part of it), so we fully itemize for healing in PvP gear now and rely on resilience to make it pvp-specific enough that it won&apos;t be considered ultimate raid gear.<br>
<br>
New Season 3 healing wand<br>
New wand for healers too, hurray.<br>
Would it help if I said there is a new healing wand for Season 3 Arena?<br>
<br>
Low level item changes in 2.3<br>
Yes, we&apos;re making updates to quite a few items for both instances and quests below level 60 in patch 2.3.<br>
<br>
Safe traveling to Zul&apos;aman and Sunwell Plateau<br>
It seems that there will be a relatively safe way to travel to Zul&apos;aman (and Sunwell plateau in 2.4) for alliance players on PvP realms.<br>
We do have plans in the works to make sure that we can get Alliance players access to this area and the Sunwell Plateau as well. Unfortunately, I can&apos;t give you any more information on this since there is still some work in progress in this regard.<br>
<br>
PvP realms will always have more activity in these hotspot areas no matter how you get there, but we will get you there just the same.<br>
<br>
More changes coming to Alterac Valley<br>
There are more changes scheduled, probably to fix the problem with horde/alliance win ratio.<br>
There are more changes coming for AV that we&apos;ll be talking about later. Hopefully we&apos;ll only be getting better. <br>
<br>
Engineer flying mount<br>
We currently don&apos;t plan to require Nether Vortices or a single Nether Vortex for the new Repair Bot or the Flying Mount.<br>
<br>
Kael&apos;thas encounter bugged<br>
We looked into this, and found a new bug. Any of the enchanted weapons that are alive at the point when Prince Kael&apos;thas resurrects his advisors will immediately have their health increased.<br>
<br>
We currently cannot hotfix this issue, but we hope to resolve the problem relatively soon.</div></div>
