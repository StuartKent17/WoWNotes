Overview - Immerseus begins with 100 Corruption, displayed as a visible power bar, and the objective of the encounter is to cleanse him by reducing his Corruption level to 0. Each time Immerseus is reduced to zero health, he will Split into a mix of dark Sha Puddles and watery Contaminated Puddles. As the Puddles move back towards the center of the chamber, damage-dealers must destroy Sha Puddles, while healers try to heal Contaminated Puddles in order to fully purify them, before they reach the central pool. Following each Split, Immerseus will reform with full health, but reduced Corruption depending on how successful the raid was in dealing with the two types of Puddles. This cycle will repeat until Immerseus is cleansed.
Tears of the Vale - As a water elemental, Immerseus attacks players directly.

Sha Bolt http://www.wowdb.com/spells/143295 - Immerseus fires a Sha Bolt at every enemy, inflicting 75,000 Shadow damage to enemies within 5 yards, and forming a Sha Pool at the targeted location. Sha Pools inflict 75,000 Shadow damage every second.
<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/important.png" title="Important" /> Swirl http://www.wowdb.com/spells/143413 - Immerseus causes torrents of Sha-corrupted water to burst from beneath the cracks in the ground. Players that come into contact with the tainted waters will suffer 30,000 Shadow damage and be knocked away.
<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/tank.png" title="Tank" /> Corrosive Blast http://www.wowdb.com/spells/143436 - Immerseus inflicts 600,000 Shadow damage in a cone aimed at his primary target, increasing Shadow damage taken by 100% for 45 sec. Stacks.
Seeping Sha http://www.wowdb.com/spells/143286 - Coming into contact with the Seeping Sha that surrounds Immerseus inflicts 100,000 Shadow damage and knocks players back.
<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/heroic.png" title="Heroic" /> <img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/important.png" title="Important" /> Swelling Corruption http://www.wowdb.com/spells/143574 - Immerseus surges with power, gaining stacks of Swelling Corruption proportional to his current Corruption level. This power lashes out at players who strike Immerseus, coalescing into a Congealed Sha creature as well as inflicting Sha Corruption upon the attacker, which deals at least 2,500 Shadow damage every 1 sec for 10 sec, increasing in damage rapidly with each additional stack.

Split http://www.wowdb.com/spells/143020 - Upon reaching zero health, Immerseus becomes unstable and bursts into a shower of Sha Puddles and Contaminated Puddles, which will attempt to reform in the pool at the center of the chamber. For each Sha Puddle killed and each Contaminated Puddle healed to full, Immerseus's Corruption is reduced by one.

<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/dps.png" title="Dps" /> Sha Puddle - When destablized, Immerseus forms one Sha Puddle for every four units of Corruption he has. Destroying a Sha Puddle before it merges back into the central pool will remove one unit of Corruption.

Sha Residue http://www.wowdb.com/spells/143459 - When a Sha Puddle is destroyed, it triggers Sha Residue, inflicting 75,000 Shadow damage to enemies within 8 yards and increasing damage dealt to other Sha Puddles by 25%. This effect stacks.

<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/healer.png" title="Healer" /> Contaminated Puddle - When destablized, Immerseus forms one Contaminated Puddle for every four units of Corruption that have previously been removed. Healing a Contaminated Puddle to full health before it merges back into the central pool will cause it to become Purified, and remove one unit of Corruption upon reaching Immerseus.

<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/magic.png" title="Magic" /> Congealing http://www.wowdb.com/spells/143540 - The speed of the Contaminated Puddle wanes as it increases in health.
<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/magic.png" title="Magic" /> Purified Residue http://www.wowdb.com/spells/143524 - Upon reaching full health, a Contaminated Puddle released Purified Residue, restoring 25% mana to allies within 10 yards and increasing healing done by 75%. This effect stacks.

Erupting Sha http://www.wowdb.com/spells/143498 - When any Puddle reaches Immerseus, it triggers an eruption, inflicting 75,000 Shadow damage to all players for a Sha or Contaminated Puddle, or 30,000 Frost damage for a Purified Puddle.
<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/heroic.png" title="Heroic" /> <img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/important.png" title="Important" /> Sha Pool http://www.wowdb.com/spells/143462 - The Sha Pool grows over time, inflicting at least 3,000 Shadow damage over 1 sec to enemies who touch it, stacking and increasing rapidly in damage proportional to the number of stacks. Touching the Sha Pool causes it to shrink, whereas it will expand whenever any Puddle reaches it.
Seeping Sha http://www.wowdb.com/spells/143286 - Coming into contact with the Seeping Sha that surrounds Immerseus inflicts 100,000 Shadow damage and knocks players back.

Test http://www.wowdb.com/spells/127469 - Flexible entry.

Transmogrification and Player Housing
To Blizzard for finally showing where players stand in regards to our opinions after all several people have asked for changes to the game only to be ignored players asked for lvl 60 Tmog gear they asked for player housing and countless other changes to be made only to be ignored.its clearly obvious whos opinions matter here and its the trolls and flamers that belittle and put down those who try to ask for changes. so in the end to Bashiok and Zaph and the others i can tell you gratz you let the forum trolls win and the opinions of players who do ask for change dont matter 
There's nothing wrong with asking for changes or additions to the game. I think the issue you're running into is an issue regarding an expectation that by voicing your ideas that something will happen in a very short time because of it. We very much take into account a variety of ideas, thoughts, opinions, and constructive feedback on an ongoing basis. It's a never ending cycle in which we must weigh in what we can add into the game that will be most beneficial to it against what we have the technology and resources in place to make it work well with.

In regard to Transmog ideas, we're always open to hearing of what you want most that you aren't able to use currently. Keep in mind, we have been consistently adding more and more Transmog items into the mix on an ongoing basis. There are a lot of options available that never used to be possible.

We've also said that we're not against the idea of player housing, but again it has to be something we feel we can implement in a way that makes the most sense for overall gameplay. 

I think "ignoring" is a bit harsh of a claim given that the meaning of "Ignore" is "to refrain from noticing or recognizing". We have noticed these ideas, we recognize them, it just doesn't mean we are going to always agree with them and implement them or even if we do agree implement them right away. Good development takes time. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/263246-congratulations/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9377487923?page=1#19

"The Crowd Chose You http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/144389-the-crowd-chose-you" Clarification.
There are some very good points being brought up in here, particularly the dispute between the “frequency in which each team gets someone from the other team close to death during the course of one game” Vs “how close to death the enemy was”.

Some solutions could encourage turtling and we have to pay attention to that.

On the other hand, we also don’t want to change players’ behaviour too much because of this, for example, some healers might stop feeling comfortable playing at low health in order to keep the pressure on the other team during certain moments, and paladins/spriests/mages/hunters/rogues won’t wait so long before they bubble/block/deterrence/vanish, etc…

Who should win between a team that nearly kills their opponent 20 times during one single match and a team that leaves their opponent at 1 HP and plays defensively during the rest of the game?

Maybe there could be a mix between both variables with some weight applied to each of them. 

We’ll make sure to share the potential issues you brought up with the devs, there are many solutions available to break ties and it’s possible that we end up seeing some iteration on this.
