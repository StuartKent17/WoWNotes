We recognize that many plate tanks are making their gear choices based on the amount of armor they&#x2019;re provided, as this is currently the most preferred stat. In order to make the tier-10 plate tanking sets more desirable, we will be adjusting the stats on the gloves and chest pieces in order to inflate the amount of armor they provide in the next minor patch. This will apply to all item levels of the tier-10 death knight, warrior, and paladin tanking gloves and chest pieces.<br>
<br>
Similar items crafted or purchased with Emblems of Frost will continue to be very good and will compare favorably to all but the Heroic difficulty boss loot, so you shouldn&apos;t despair if you recently acquired any of those.<br>

Europe - PvP to PvE Realm Conversion: Vek&#x2019;nilash<br>
As part of our continued efforts to balance the World of Warcraft player population across all realms, we will be converting one of our lower-population European PvP realms -- Vek&#x2019;nilash -- to a Normal PvE realm. For players on Vek&#x2019;nilash, we will be offering free Character Moves to alternate PvP realms both before and after the conversion takes place. This will allow us to continue to support healthy communities on the realms and help new players transition easily into the community.<br>
<br>
The conversion will take place on February 10, with the Character Moves opening on January 27 and lasting until March 10. Upon being converted to Normal PvE, Vek&#x2019;nilash will be given the &#x201C;New Players&#x201D; flag to ensure an influx of players over the coming weeks.<br>
<br>
For any questions, please refer to the main thread in the Vek&apos;nilash realm forum:<br>

Reasons behind Season 8 delay<br>
Because information in the next minor content patch is needed to start it and the patch is not out yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22748958184-yo-why-delay-the-arena-season.html))<br>
<br>
Quel&apos;delar for tanks<br>
We talked about this back when the quest was available on the PTR, but in short, we are not adding a tanking specific weapon to the rewards table for this quest. We did not forget tanks, we just weren&apos;t aiming the rewards at them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22748777973-queldelar.html))<br>
<br>
Threat issues in the first seconds of a fight<br>
This is something we talk a lot about. On the one hand, good healers know not to overdo it in the first few seconds because the tank is unlikely to die anyway. On the other, it&apos;s a bit awkward that threat issues are exponentially more dangerous in the first few seconds than in those that follow. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/22748775349-when-will-the-prot-dps-buff-come.html))<br>
<br>
Balancing classes in Wrath of the Lich King<br>
Yes. We have made a few mistakes in the 3.X patch cycle where we over-buffed or over-nerfed a spec. Aside from the risk that we&apos;ll have to revert some of the changes, it just sucks when say all hunters felt like they had to go Survival or all mages felt like they had to go Arcane. Ideally your spec would be a choice, but we feel like the second best scenario is to not keep changing which spec is on top (especially when that requires you to re-gear, etc.).<br>
<br>
Players also tend to have different expectations for dps than we do. It&apos;s typical now for anyone who doesn&apos;t see their dps at 10,000 (or to see simulation output that suggests 10,000) to assume that something is wrong with their class. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22749567797-tell-me-this-is-a-joke-patch-notes-332.html))<br>
<br>
[...] We believe you can&apos;t just balance around the best players. It&apos;s possible for a class to be too good among less-skilled players (perhaps because it is easy to play) or too good among highly-skilled players (perhaps because only they can get the full benefit out of it). You need to look at players at a variety of skill levels.<br>
<br>
You also have to be very careful trying to correlate population with power. I&apos;m sure there is a correlation, but it might not be a very strong one, at least in PvE. It is probably more true of PvP. In PvE, a lot of other factors can influence population. Most new players to WoW have a pretty good idea of what a warrior or mage is, but may not understand the mechanics or role of a shaman or warlock. Some players just gravitate towards certain mechanics and find others bland or frustrating. Players can make life-long decisions about their class based on things as non-power-gamery as art or possible races.<br>
<br>
Where we tend to take notice is if something is really far out of whack. If players are abandoning a class or flocking to a new one, then there might be something going on. If particular classes or specs seem to fall behind in raid representation over time, it&apos;s usually in our best interest to at least try and understand why.<br>
<br>
Our community, especially the active online component, has become very obsessed with class equality over the course of Lich King. I&apos;m sure some of that is the increasing sophistication and maturity (in the sense of understanding mechanics) of the player base. (Remember, a lot more players are running heroics and especially raids than ever before in WoW&apos;s history.) I&apos;m sure another is partially the fault of myself and other developers for being relatively more vocal about our design goals and intent. Overall, I think the community would be healthier if it focused more on boss strategies and less on intra-class competition, but I understand that a competitive streak is something that goes hand in hand with being a hardcore gamer.(Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22748797321-whos-raiding.html))<br>

Moonkin T10 4pc Bonus<br>
The spell level of Languish (the tier piece proc) is too low, causing an unintended high level of resists. We can hotfix this. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22749567377-blue-response-to-moonkin-t10-4pc-please.html))<br>

Protection damage in 3.3.2<br>
The damage you&apos;re going to do depends a lot on your gear, raid buffs and personal style. But I think these are in the ballpark for an Icecrown 25 guild.<br>
<br>
Shield Slam -- hits for maybe 3500.<br>
Revenge -- hits for maybe 3000.<br>
Devastate -- hits for maybe 2000.<br>
<br>
Over the course of a raid, Shield Slam and Devastate might do about the same total damage, with Revenge doing 50% of that. (In other words, if we ignore all other abilities, you&apos;d have a pie chart with a 40%, 40%, and 20% slice, though Revenge can be pretty variable.) So at first glance, you might imagine a world in which Devastate eclipses all other abilities. But let&apos;s consider them in more detail. You&apos;re probably using Shield Slam half as often as you&apos;re hitting Devastate because of the cooldown. Are you going to give up that much damage packaged into one GCD? Now Revenge on the other hand might be a contender for another Devastate GCD, but consider the enormous rage bargain that is Revenge, even that doesn&apos;t seem like a big concern.

Tanking questions<br>
1. Are you saying that you want to move back to a pre TBC style of instance tanking where there is far more CC used? (I cannot imagine how ugly that will be training DPS to CC again)<br>
It would be nice if there were more of those pulls. BC might have been too extreme the other way where many of the trash pulls felt like boss encounters in terms of risk and planning. But maybe every third pull or something you&apos;d need to say &quot;Okay, we have to pay attention on this one.&quot; <br>
<br>
2. Are you going to add some complexity to our rotation (priority/procs?) <br>
Yes, that would be nice. <br>
<br>
3. Are you planning to remove 360 style AOE abilities or just weaken them (damage/threat)? <br>
<br>
I don&apos;t think making the tanking abilities harder to use is the answer. I&apos;m not even sure making them do less threat is the answer. If AE dps wasn&apos;t so effective and if tanks were at greater risk of dying to 5 pulls, then we&apos;d end up at the right place anyway.<br>
<br>
My point earlier was we aren&apos;t looking to make generating AE threat trivial because hopefully it will be less essential and differences in how tanks AE tank won&apos;t turn into big problems. Some tank abilities are probably essential, such as a taunt, survivability cooldowns and a way to generate snap aggro on a single target (yes, DKs, we hear you). We hope not every tank ability needs to be shared across all 4 classes, or else the druid just becomes a warrior with different art.</div></div>
