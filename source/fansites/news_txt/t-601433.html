Addon Highlight : XLoot<br>
The Illidan killshot by Forte (http://www.fortegaming.com) a few days ago flooded my mail with &quot;Hey, what&apos;s the loot addon ?&quot;. Well, it&apos;s XLoot, and I suppose it&apos;s time to talk about it. This will let you track all the items you or your party looted, by showing them on screen if you use the XLootMonitor addon as well. Of course, the main function of XLoot is to change the layout of the original loot frame to make it a lot more readable, and to let you link everything in chat without problem. <br>
<br>
As usual, you can download it by accessing the WoWace file list (http://files.wowace.com/) <br>
