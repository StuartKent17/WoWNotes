chaud2013-07-13, 12:05 AMNew Stuff Coming to the Pet Store!
We’ve got some new stuff coming to the Pet Store, and we wanted to give everyone a quick sneak peek. Obviously, the Pet Store has been the place where we sell pets and mounts, but we’ve come up with some new types of cosmetic goodies, including some fun new little toys and Transmogrifiables.

First up: a trio of cosmetic helms for Transmogrification. http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/95474.jpg Jewel of the Firelord http://www.wowdb.com/items/95474-jewel-of-the-firelord, http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/97213.jpg Hood of Hungering Darkness http://www.wowdb.com/items/97213-hood-of-hungering-darkness, and http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/95475.jpg Crown of Eternal Winter http://www.wowdb.com/items/95475-crown-of-eternal-winter When Transmog went into the game, people immediately started talking about the possibility of just buying armor looks. So we’re going ahead and forging a few helms and seeing how they fit. They don’t have any stats, they’re just for looks, and you can use them to change the appearance of the helms for any characters of any class or race they work with all armor types. They’re great for spicing up a Transmog set—or replacing a tier head piece you hate the looks of. No need to check that ‘Hide Helm’ box any longer!

Here are a few images, but keep in mind that these are all special-effecty and animated in a really cool way. You may have even seen these models pop up on Wowhead or MMO-Champion earlier this year.

We’re also trying out something else new. A lot of people have liked the kinds of fun, limited-use items you can get from the WoW TCG—so we’re taking that idea to the Pet Store. Soon you’ll be able to snag two fun new little toys: the http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/97994.jpg Seesaw http://www.wowdb.com/items/97994-seesaw and http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/98549.jpg Iron Hitching Post http://www.wowdb.com/items/98549-iron-hitching-post!

You can jump on the http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/97994.jpg Seesaw http://www.wowdb.com/items/97994-seesaw with a party member and relive the childhood glee of trying to slam your friend into the ground . . . or you can have a big ogre named Lunk launch them into the air. Really, though, you’ll probably just look super cute gazing lovingly into each other’s eyes. D’awwwww.

True story: Worgen are exactly the same weight as Ogres.

The http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/98549.jpg Iron Hitching Post http://www.wowdb.com/items/98549-iron-hitching-post is a little different: It’s an item you set down that allows you and up to 24 of your closest raiding cohorts to each jump on your own new unearthly Iron Warhorse http://www.wowdb.com/spells/142910-iron-warhorse mount. You can use it for smaller parties too, and it’s also great for Battlegrounds. Imagine the look on your opponents’ faces when they see a unified front of ghost horses galloping toward them . . . just to ruin everything and capture Snowfall Graveyard. STOP IT!

Hyah ghost-steed! Later I’ll feed you some ghost-oats in the ghost-barn.

We don’t have specific release dates for any of these items yet, but you can expect to see them show up in the Pet Store in the near future.

Let us know what you think, and what other kinds of fun and cosmetic items you might like to see in the Pet Store in the comments below!
