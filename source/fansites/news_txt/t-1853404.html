Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Saw your recent discussion about developer communication. Was interesting. Sucks how awful people can be. Stay strong.<br>
Players don&apos;t hurt my feelings. I am old and crusty. But other devs may be too scared or scarred to participate. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/634121997388087296))<br>
<br>
Shame that people fire back and say &quot;Well, the devs need thicker skin!&quot;.... -.-<br>
Would be nice if they did, but they don&apos;t, so it comes down to: do you want to talk to them or not? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/634173009121558532))<br>
<br>
But if there&apos;s a policy against talking to players, they clearly don&apos;t think it&apos;s worthwhile.<br>
Developers might value it while the institution does not. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/634121540808785921))<br>
<br>
I&apos;m just not fond of every company lately treating every single little thing like they&apos;re the nuclear launch codes<br>
You mean keeping things too close to the chest? I agree. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/634476998681755649))<br>
If you promise and have to pivot, people are going to be disappointed. Just deal with it. Still better than never talking. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/634477195994402818))<br>
<br>
What do you think has prompted WoW players to come to you seeking answers about Blizzard as of recent?<br>
I have a big mouth and poor impulse control. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/634121624883585024))<br>
