Earlier this week I posted a video of Yogg-Saron from a healer point of view, sadly this isn't the most interesting part of Yogg-Saron and it didn't show the most interesting parts of the fight. This new video by Epicfabriken http://www.epicfabriken.com/ will show you a bit more of the fight, including some of the vision rooms and Yogg-Saron's Brain.
