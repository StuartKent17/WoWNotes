Can you please do something about the phasing in Nazjatar? It&apos;s incredibly frustrating to join a group for the pvp event only to not be phased to it, no matter the relogs, teleports or other things done to try and force it.<br>
Apologies for the frustrations. We&#x2019;re actively investigating and working on solutions. Thank you for your patience and reports. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1145760613488046086))<br>

Here are some other issues we&apos;re working on quickly:<br>
<br>
(1/3) We&#x2019;re increasing the health of all of the lowest-health rare spawns in both Nazjatar and Mechagon, to help more players get a chance to hit them before they die. They also scale in health faster as more players tap them. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1145780618313314304))<br>
<br>
(2/3) We&#x2019;re making &quot;Dangerous Creatures&quot; only require 1 rare, and we&#x2019;re fixing a bug where some rare spawns didn&#x2019;t give quest credit. Combined with the above change, it should be a lot easier to complete. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1145780679344578561))<br>
<br>
(3/3) World Quest bosses in Nazjatar will no longer show up with a silver dragon portrait. After this hotfix, is should be easier to tell what&#x2019;s a boss for a World Quest and what&#x2019;s a true rare spawn.
