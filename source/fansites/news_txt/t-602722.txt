Shapeshifting breaks most of the visual effects like Hallow's End transformations because some really weird stuff could happen by combining multiple effects. This way, the devs can design and add new effects without too much restriction because of spells not working together. Source 

Mages
Hypothermia duration got increased because 30 seconds was short enough to let mages buy the time needed to iceblock a second time. Source 

Priests
Most of the major changes to the discipline tree shouldn't happen before WotLK Source 

2.3 Patch testing
The arena season state is not persisting after a server reset, this is why the arena vendors keep disappearing. Also, the new arena UI is not displaying when Season 3 starts so you can not see your personal rating. Both of these issues will be fixed in an upcoming PTR build. Source 

Headless Horseman
All the epic loot from the Headless Horseman is permanent, except the mounts. Source 
The broom mount only have a 14 days duration to let people get it without having to worry about keeping it as a special rare mount, this is also why the droprate is so high. Source 

Interface
The Interface AddOn Kit has been updated to work with the 2.3 test realm:  

Wrath of the Lich King
We're mostly seeing screenshots of landscape because it's a good way to show the variety and feel of the new zones. Source 

Wrath of the Lich King
Two new screenshots again.
