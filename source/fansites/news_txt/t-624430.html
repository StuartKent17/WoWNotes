I talked about the final version of the item pages a few weeks ago, sadly it took a lot more time than I expected and I couldn&apos;t get them ready for the release of the expansion. Hopefully that&apos;s nothing a few extra days of work couldn&apos;t solve and most of these pages are now ready, they&apos;re not as nice as I expected them to be in the first place but most of the information is here and it will probably make your life easier if you&apos;re trying to upgrade your gear. <br>
<br>
Items are sorted by slot &gt; spec &gt; ilvl, it could be disturbing at the beginning but it will eventually make sense after a few seconds. If you REALLY want to sort the columns in a different way you can always click their name (your cursor won&apos;t change, but it works). <br>
<br>
Please report the following issues in comments<br>
Any error you can find. (Wrong spec, etc ...)<br>
Outdated screenshots (there are a few of them, most of the time the item tooltip will be up to date)<br>
Missing items<br>
<br>
The page for librams / totems / idols / sigils will be available in a few minutes is now available. <br>
