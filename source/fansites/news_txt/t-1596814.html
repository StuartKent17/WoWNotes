You might recall that Blizzard &quot;reset&quot; the Titan project back in mid 2013 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3262-Titan-project-reset-delayed-until-2016). Mike Morhaime confirmed to Polygon (http://www.polygon.com/2014/9/23/6833953/blizzard-cancels-titan-next-gen-mmo-pc) today that the project is now cancelled.<br>
<br>
<br>
The team set out to make another amazing MMO after World of Warcraft, but they didn&apos;t find the fun or passion.<br>
Metzen said the decision to cancel Titan was excruciating, but cancelling projects has always resulted in better quality work.<br>
Right now Blizzard doesn&apos;t want to spend time working on another MMO.<br>
Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm helped Blizzard realize they don&apos;t have to work on giant projects.<br>
<br>
<br>
However, it doesn&apos;t mean that the development team is no longer working on something. Multiple sources who seem to point towards a new unannounced project from Blizzard that would be codenamed Prometheus and could be another project built around a new license for Blizzard.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that this last bit is very much unofficial and unconfirmed.</div></div>
