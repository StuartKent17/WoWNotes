For the moment, it only looks like PTR bugfixes, and most of you probably never noticed them. ^^

Hunters
The new aimed shot is here.

Rogues
The overpowered poison bug has been fixed. 
Warriors
The stance bug has been fixed. Switching from one stance, to the same stance


New PTR Build
The news will be edited to list all the changes, but don't expect too many of them, we're 5 days away from the release.
The PTR is being taken down to update to a new build. We expect the downtime to last between four and six hours.

There are no new character copies, no new pre-mades, and no new patch notes.

Something might be added to the Armory to provide accurate indications of qualified team numbers for each bracket, and possibly if a team is currently qualified or not. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2766101883&postId=28557408255&sid=1#366
