<br>
Update #7 - Added the new model of Mekkatorque and Vol&apos;jin. <br>
Update #6 - Added a small info on the two new mounts, <br>
Update #5 - A few more details on the Ruby Sanctum from Zarhym (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23329393289-assault-on-the-ruby-sanctum.html)<br>
<br>
<br>
Gnomeregan will be recaptured before Cataclysm!<br>
A couple of very very very interesting achievements were added to the game files with this patch. I&apos;m pretty sure it wasn&apos;t intentional but ...<br>
<br>
Gnomecoming King (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4786/) - You assisted High Tinker Mekkatorque and the Gnomeregan Exiles in the recapture of Gnomeregan&apos;s surface.<br>
Gnomecoming Queen (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4787/) - You assisted High Tinker Mekkatorque and the Gnomeregan Exiles in the recapture of Gnomeregan&apos;s surface.<br>
<br>
Apparently, parts of the pre-Cataclysm event have been deployed in this patch and retaking Gnomeregan will be part of it!<br>
<br>
Blizzard didn&apos;t forget about horde players, it looks like Trolls will play a big part in the pre-Cataclysm event for the Horde :<br>
<br>
New taxi nodes<br>
Durotar - ET - CC Prologue Troll Taxi Bat Start (#438)<br>
Durotar - ET - CC Prologue Troll Recruit End (#439)<br>
Durotar - ET - CC Prologue - Troll Battle End (#440)<br>
<br>
After going through the patch files I found a couple of extra spells that might be related to the event, see the spell comparison part of the new. Also, both Vol&apos;jin and Mekkatorque had their appearance updated.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
New Models<br>
A few extra models have been added with this patch. <br>
Two new mounts, the Blazing Hippogryph (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74855/blazing-hippogryph/) and the Wooly White Rhino (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74918/wooly-white-rhino/). Important - For the moment, both mounts are TCG rewards but it could change in the future if we consider that UDE and Blizzard aren&apos;t working together anymore. We&apos;ll probably hear from the blues about that at some point.<br>
An updated model for Anduin Wrynn (http://www.wowwiki.com/Anduin_Wrynn), the son of Varian Wrynn!<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Spell Comparison<br>
So far it looks like the patch notes were accurate and I couldn&apos;t notice any new class change when comparing spells tooltips. I won&apos;t list them another time just to avoid confusion, the patch notes are fine. <br>

Ruby Sanctum<br>
The new Ruby Sanctum raid instance IS NOT PART OF PATCH 3.3.3 but a beta version of the map and the loading screen are already here.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/rubysanctum_map_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/rubysanctum_map.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/rubysanctum_loadingscreen_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/rubysanctum_loadingscreen.jpg)<br>
<br>
Zarhym also posted a few more details on the instance and the loot you will find here.<br>
<br>
Number 2. The lieutenants are sub-bosses which will each drop an Emblem of Frost. Halion is the main boss. While the activation of Heroic difficulty is different from the Obsidian Sanctum, the overall raid format for the Ruby Sanctum is very comparable. <br>
You&apos;re likely to find some random pieces of armor on par with Lich King loot, similar to the items Onyxia dropped while Trial of the Crusader was the top-tier raid. You can also expect to see some more trinkets and things of that nature. <br>
This raid will not only provide a bit of additional content to pair with the current content of patch 3.3, it will be the beginning of an advancement in the storyline for Cataclysm. <br>
The plan is to have a normal mode and a heroic mode just like Icecrown Citadel, so far there is no plan for a Sartharion +1/+2/+3-like encounter.<br>
<br>
<br>
Interface - Auction House and Random Battlegrounds<br>
The Auction House interface has been improved and now let you auction stacks of the same item without having to use an addon. The Battleground Queue interface has been slightly modified to include the random battleground and call to arms bonuses.<br>

Patch 3.3.3: Frozo The Renowned<br>
I&apos;m sure some of you noticed this in the 3.3.3 PTR patch notes:<br>

<br>
For those curious, here are the items for which you can trade your Frozen Orbs to Frozo. These each cost 1 Frozen Orb unless noted otherwise in parentheses:<br>
<br>
Crusader Orb (6)<br>
Runed Orb (4)<br>
Eternal Fire<br>
Eternal Earth<br>
Eternal Water<br>
Eternal Air<br>
Eternal Life<br>
Eternal Shadow<br>
Frost Lotus<br>

Don&apos;t be silly, the Frost Lotus price is obviously a bug.</div></div>
