Boubouille2007-03-20, 04:17 AMWe're in the process of making a hotfix to the Lady Vashj encounter. The hotfix entails a slight adjustment to the hitpoints of some of the adds that spawn during the encounter. The fix should go live in the next 24 hours.

So ... Death and Taxes getting the patch first during the downtime and killing her ? Or will it be a fix without downtime, allowing Nihilum and Curse to work on her one more day than Death and Taxes before their instance resets ?
