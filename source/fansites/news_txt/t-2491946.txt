Reddit user Nivens https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/c0086d/are_you_aware_that_the_maximum_level_of_120_will/ reported that they received an interesting survey from Blizzard regarding an upcoming level squish. The wording of this survey makes it seem that a level squish is already slated to happen sometime in the future. This has not been confirmed by Blizzard.

During a previous Battle for Azeroth Q&A https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7780-Developer-Q-A-with-Ion-Hazzikostas-Battle-for-Azeroth on Twitch, Ion Hazzikostas said the team was exploring the idea of a level squish, as new players may be deterred by seeing such high levels needed to reach the endgame. You can watch the full answer to the level squish question here https://www.twitch.tv/videos/286658051?t=0h44m03s, where they discuss the pros and cons.
