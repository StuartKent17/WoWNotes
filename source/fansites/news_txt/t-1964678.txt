Mistweaver Monk Feedback -- Build 21249 -- 9-Mar
Essence Font should be getting a maximum of 18 bolts per cast, even if you recast early. When testing it out on a single target, you may be able to see 7 heals instead of 6 when you chain two of them, but I believe in real multi-target use you'd still see 36 bolts in total let us know if you observe differently on alpha. 

There is still no reason to channel it all the way because the waves of bolts aren't evenly spaced over the duration of the channel.
Essence Font should attempt to fire 18 bolts evenly spaced over the course of 1 non-extended channel regardless of haste. It's probably hard to test on fewer than 6 targets since you won't see some of the bolts. Please post a bug if you see any different behavior from that on alpha. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Hello! can you tell me if druids' glyphs of Travel and Chamaleon will be avaliable in Legion in some way?
Chameleon will be returning. Glyph of Travel is not currently planned to return, since glyphs are now cosmetic. WarcraftDevs 

So Judgement can get to 100% uptime with haste, but enrage has to be demolished by haste? I'm a little confused. 
The haste breakpoints caused by fitting additional GCDs within that sort of short very powerful buff are 1/2 WarcraftDevs 
a significant issue. Judgment and Colossus Smash will be adjusted to solve this as well. 2/2 WarcraftDevs

Hey, is bad luck protection built into Deepening Shadows at all? Wondering if there's a limit to the proc "wait."
It's a simple 5% chance per combo point, nothing further. Celestalon

The raiding scene is collapsing. Warcraft is dying. But don't worry, because we're honing in on pet battles!
I understand the frustration, if you could focus on a few specifics, what do you want to see improved? What's broken? Why, IYO? Muffinus 
make raiding a reward again for time and effort invested. You were at your peak when this was the case.
This is a VERY good question. Can difficult raids exist in the modern world? Did it work for _____? Muffinus 
For example, the expansion-ending raids last too long, that's totally true. But I feel that raid fights are solid in WOD Muffinus 
In before this shows up on MMO-C, ground floor. Muffinus 
what about not longer but harder lvl, or Video how to fix the early game.
Totally agree that more leveling challenges make for a more textured experience. Muffinus 
I think the lvling in wow is actually wows biggest Problem besides 1 year for 1 raid
Do people level often with their main now that boosts are a thing? I level alts, often in odd ways, eg archi Muffinus 
well I think alts should be more important for different playstyles and boosts dont feel statisfying for me
Personally, I'm an alt-gamer. I like levelling alts in fun ways, did Rogue All PvP, Tank All Dungeon Muffinus 
Note to self: why isn't there an achievement for this. Muffinus 
Talking about alts: why is there no achievement for getting ALL classes to max level?
If you could get a toy for this achievement, what would it do? Muffinus 

Was Timeless Isle too challenging? Muffinus 

Pets and Pet Battles
That said, I'd love to get some faction pride pets.Just not another scorpion for Horde. Tired of scorpions now.
So like a boar? Or a wolf. Wolf-boar? Muffinus 

Misc
so you said dungeons, world bossEs and pvp make an mmo. But it's more than that right?
Not to be too undertale about it but people make an MMO. Free hugs. Muffinus 

The players grew up, and so has the game. is still the 5000 lbs gorilla in the MMO room.
every expac the game feels less like an mmo. What can you do to change this?
What makes an MMO? Good question. What sparks MMO memories for you? Dungeons, World Bosses, PvP? Muffinus 
random matchmade groups. The one thing I miss from Vanilla and BC wow was my server community
.I don't disagree, I miss the old Tichondrius forums. Is this viable in the current climate? Muffinus 
what do you mean the old forums? Like the old layout?
.Nah like back in the day when people would post cascade memes during BWL progression @ckaleiki Muffinus 
did you play any older mmo, like Everquest or Ultima online?
My first MMO was Dragonrealms, the text-based MUD Muffinus 
I spend 4+ hours leading community raids on normal because that's the only mmo feeling
I remember this feeling from WOTLK Naxx, and then ICC/TOTC farming for solace Muffinus
