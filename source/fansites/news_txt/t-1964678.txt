Mistweaver Monk Feedback -- Build 21249 -- 9-Mar
Essence Font should be getting a maximum of 18 bolts per cast, even if you recast early. When testing it out on a single target, you may be able to see 7 heals instead of 6 when you chain two of them, but I believe in real multi-target use you'd still see 36 bolts in total let us know if you observe differently on alpha. 

There is still no reason to channel it all the way because the waves of bolts aren't evenly spaced over the duration of the channel.
Essence Font should attempt to fire 18 bolts evenly spaced over the course of 1 non-extended channel regardless of haste. It's probably hard to test on fewer than 6 targets since you won't see some of the bolts. Please post a bug if you see any different behavior from that on alpha.

Hello! can you tell me if druids' glyphs of Travel and Chamaleon will be avaliable in Legion in some way?
Chameleon will be returning. Glyph of Travel is not currently planned to return, since glyphs are now cosmetic. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705225190112784384

So Judgement can get to 100% uptime with haste, but enrage has to be demolished by haste? I'm a little confused. 
The haste breakpoints caused by fitting additional GCDs within that sort of short very powerful buff are 1/2 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705225388398497797
a significant issue. Judgment and Colossus Smash will be adjusted to solve this as well. 2/2 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705225433277603840

Hey, is bad luck protection built into Deepening Shadows at all? Wondering if there's a limit to the proc "wait."
It's a simple 5% chance per combo point, nothing further. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/705523549457375233

PvE
The raiding scene is collapsing. Warcraft is dying. But don't worry, because we're honing in on pet battles!
I understand the frustration, if you could focus on a few specifics, what do you want to see improved? What's broken? Why, IYO? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704930586918526976
make raiding a reward again for time and effort invested. You were at your peak when this was the case.
This is a VERY good question. Can difficult raids exist in the modern world? Did it work for _____? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704961556803510276
For example, the expansion-ending raids last too long, that's totally true. But I feel that raid fights are solid in WOD Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704931179884105728
In before this shows up on MMO-C, ground floor. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704931337011142656
what about not longer but harder lvl, or Video how to fix the early game.
Totally agree that more leveling challenges make for a more textured experience. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704938143187918848
I think the lvling in wow is actually wows biggest Problem besides 1 year for 1 raid
Do people level often with their main now that boosts are a thing? I level alts, often in odd ways, eg archi Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704939240786944002
well I think alts should be more important for different playstyles and boosts dont feel statisfying for me
Personally, I'm an alt-gamer. I like levelling alts in fun ways, did Rogue All PvP, Tank All Dungeon Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704940316378439680
Note to self: why isn't there an achievement for this. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704940421248643074
Talking about alts: why is there no achievement for getting ALL classes to max level?
If you could get a toy for this achievement, what would it do? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704960623407288320

Was Timeless Isle too challenging? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704963191739011072

Pets and Pet Battles
That said, I'd love to get some faction pride pets.Just not another scorpion for Horde. Tired of scorpions now.
So like a boar? Or a wolf. Wolf-boar? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704953505459662848

Misc
so you said dungeons, world bossEs and pvp make an mmo. But it's more than that right?
Not to be too undertale about it but people make an MMO. Free hugs. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704946491509579777

The players grew up, and so has the game. is still the 5000 lbs gorilla in the MMO room.
every expac the game feels less like an mmo. What can you do to change this?
What makes an MMO? Good question. What sparks MMO memories for you? Dungeons, World Bosses, PvP? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704942980105433089
random matchmade groups. The one thing I miss from Vanilla and BC wow was my server community
.I don't disagree, I miss the old Tichondrius forums. Is this viable in the current climate? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704944266955657217
what do you mean the old forums? Like the old layout?
.Nah like back in the day when people would post cascade memes during BWL progression @ckaleiki Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704945441880809475
did you play any older mmo, like Everquest or Ultima online?
My first MMO was Dragonrealms, the text-based MUD Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704946645654495233
I spend 4+ hours leading community raids on normal because that's the only mmo feeling
I remember this feeling from WOTLK Naxx, and then ICC/TOTC farming for solace Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704947137839276037
