Stay tuned for more information! Feel free to post anything you find in comments.<br>
The Trial of the Champion is now open on North American PTR realms. We&apos;re going to leave it open for testing for a while, unless something is broken to the point of causing serious testing issues.<br>
<br>
This is very much a work in progress, please make sure and post bug reports and feedback for this dungeon.<br>
<br>
Make sure you note if you try normal or heroic mode, as well as your gear and dungeon/raid experience when posting feedback.</div></div>
