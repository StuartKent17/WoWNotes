Alpha Realm Maintenance - 12/14

Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
What do you say to the ol' 10m guilds that couldn't or wouldn'trecruit 10 more for Mythic and are calling for 10m 2 return?
I was in a 40-person guild, and we had to tell some folks they likely wouldn't be raiding much. OccupyGStreet 
My point is, it's hard to give everyone the precise experience they are looking for. But that doesn't make it easier on them. OccupyGStreet 

Love Undercity and the ruins of Lordaeron above and Varimathras, Any cool cities that were scrapped? 
As a lover of all things Underdark, I lament that Azjol was reduced to only a couple of dungeons. Maybe someday? OccupyGStreet 

I grew up playing all the "classic" RTS games of the late 90s/early 00's AoE, C&C, Starcraft, Warcraft etc. I have a lot of nostalgia for the genre and I feel like a lot of other people do too. What do you think classic RTS could do, if anything, to make a comeback?
I think you have to ooze charm. I'll mention Age of Empires, not because I think it's the best RTS in every aspect, but it did a great job with the charm that hooked people in...

The fishing villagers carried a giant, flopping fish.
The big cats would sometimes hunt down the gazelle.
It was fun to place the walls around your town.
The priest said Wololo.
