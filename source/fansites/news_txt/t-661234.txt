The Blizzcon is in less than 2 weeks and it's time for a few reminders. The new WoW expansion will most likely be announced during the Blizzcon, the codename seems to be Cataclysm and the new races the Worgens and the Goblins. We might see some teasers on the official site a few days before the Blizzcon, keep an eye on this site. 

Goblins and Worgens are the new races of the Expansion http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=79546.0
Blizzard trademarks "Cataclysm" http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=70411.0

If you can't attend the event, you can watch the live stream of the event for $40/30€. Both low quality and high quality are available, note that the high quality stream requires you to install a P2P client. 

This year, for the first time, you'll have the opportunity to enjoy a live Internet stream of BlizzCon coverage from the comfort of your own home. The stream includes the same content as the DIRECTV pay-per-view event, but you do not have to be a DIRECTV subscriber to purchase it. It consists of over 16 hours of video, including interviews and commentary, main stage presentations, and tournament coverage. It’s now available to order for $39.95, and purchasers will also receive the BlizzCon 2009-exclusive in-game pet, Grunty the Murloc Marine not available in all regions. Head over to the BlizzCon 2009 Live Stream website to get more information, to test video playback on your system, or to place an order.

Buying the stream or attending the Blizzcon will give you a nice Grunty the Murloc in-game pet.
