<br>
Nexus<br>
In the Borean Tundra (2nd starting zone with Howling Fjord) will be the Nexus. This is where you will find the blue dragons splitted between 3 instances :<br>
A level 70-71, 5 players instance (Ice Caverns).<br>
A level 80 instance that let you fight on big magical rings that float above the grounds (o_O)<br>
A rift in the sky where you will be able to fight Malygos with a 25 person raid. (Like Gruul or Onyxia, it will be a short raid) <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Dustwallow Marsh<br>
A new goblin town will be added to Dustwallow Marsh with new quests. <br>
<br>
Faster leveling<br>
In a future patch (before the expansion), levels 20 to 60 will have the experience required per-level reduced and quests will yield 30% more experience. <br>
<br>
Heroic Badges<br>
As long with the tons of new items added to the heroic badge vendor in 2.3, they&apos;re considering the possibility to add armor sets as heroic badges rewards. <br>
<br>
Utgarde Keep<br>
The first dungeon of WotLK will have two wings. The first one being Utgarde Keep, a level 70 instance for 5 players. The second one is Utgarde Pinnacle, this one will be level 80 for 5 players. Both instances will have heroic modes.<br>
<br>
Inscription profession<br>
They don&apos;t want a profession to just do spell improvements like +100 damage, instead they want it to be something that let you increase the radius of your frost nova, or increase the root timer of the spell, etc ...<br>
<br>
Hunters<br>
Hunters may get a &quot;woodworking&quot; profession in the future, to let them create arrows. (But it will be released much later, don&apos;t expect it for WotLK)<br>
They&apos;re trying to improve the desirability of hunters in arenas, one of the idea is to give them a mortal strike-like shot that reduces the healing effectiveness on the target.<br>
