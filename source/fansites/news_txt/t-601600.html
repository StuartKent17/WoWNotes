Expansion<br>
Nop, I&apos;m still not accepting fake posts about the expansion on the forums. A lot of sites will be posting anything they can find in the next days to see their traffic boosted anyway. <br>
The last post was about someone getting banned for saying that the expansion is the Undermine. Which is pretty stupid because you could get banned by saying that the expansion is Northrend or anything else, you could probably get banned for saying that the next expansion has Harry Potter in it.<br>
<br>
The expansion will be Northrend, there isn&apos;t anything you can do about it. <br>
<br>
Update : Almost forgot, no, the fact that someone out of nowhere claims that he got a sheet music with Northrend written on it isn&apos;t a proof. Actually I doubt that Blizzard needs to add the name of the song at the end of each sheet to have it played.</div></div>
