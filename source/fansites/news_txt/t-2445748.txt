Can you feel it?
The spirit world draws close during the Day of the Dead 
This is why we decorate the graves of our dearly departed with flowers  and candles  and offerings: To welcome them back, even if only for a time.
So come! Dance with me!
Let us cherish and honor those we have lost in their ghostly presence, so that they might eat and drink and smile and know that they are loved. – Catrina

A little Bread of the Dead  can go a long way to restoring your health, so make sure to purchase the recipe from Chapman, who can also be found in Dalaran in the Broken Isles.
