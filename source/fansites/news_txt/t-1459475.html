Patch 5.4.7 is going live this week, with a new PvP season, Level 90 Boost preparation, and other assets for future use.<br>
<br>
<br>
Season 15 PvP gear will use the same models as Season 14, but with the colors available to each faction switched. <br>
There will be some minor adjustments (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3769-Upcoming-Siege-of-Orgrimmar-Changes-Challenge-Mode-End-of-Season-Blue-Tweets-Art) to Heroic Garrosh (10).<br>
The Level 90 boost feature will be added in this patch, but no announcement has been made as to when it will actually be available.<br>
This patch and launcher updates prepared things for the Warlords of Draenor pre-order, but no date has been announced yet.<br>
The Warlords of Draenor Collector&apos;s Edition mount and pet are included in this patch. <br>
The Scroll of Resurrection ends on Tuesday, so be sure to send out any final invitations before then.<br>
No new realm connections are currently listed for this week.<br>

The Scroll of Resurrection Retires<br>
The time has come to bid adieu to the Scroll of Resurrection. It&#x2019;s served its divine purpose, but like most scrolls, it only has so many charges before it loses its magic and crumbles into ethereal dust. For those who&#x2019;d still like a chance to use the scroll, you have until February 18 before players are no longer able to send invitations. For those who have an invitation outstanding, that&#x2019;s still good for 30 days from the time it was sent, after which point the invitation will expire and the benefits can no longer be claimed.<br>
