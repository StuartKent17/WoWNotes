Nothing really interesting today, except for hunters and guild chat spammers maybe. <br>
Hunters<br>
1 yard range is a lie (the cake too). It&apos;s actually a tooltip error and it should be &quot;5-35 yards&quot;, you shouldn&apos;t be able to shot someone while being meleed. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2649575219&amp;postId=25734526999&amp;sid=1#34))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Patch 2.3 and season 3 may not start on the same date, Blizzard plan to give a two week notice on the start of season 3. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2647295317&amp;postId=25734527156&amp;sid=1#2))<br>
<br>
Hallow&apos;s End<br>
Items with a duration on them won&apos;t all vanish on November first, you just won&apos;t be able to get any new ones. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2647305108&amp;postId=25734527485&amp;sid=1#131))<br>
<br>
Wrath of the Lich King<br>
There will be more than one type of siege weapon but there isn&apos;t any final list of them yet. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2518770867&amp;postId=25734830616&amp;sid=1#4))<br>
There is no beta yet, don&apos;t trust scam sites. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2649575279&amp;postId=25734527373&amp;sid=1#1))<br>
<br>
Interface<br>
The spam-protection preventing multi-lines messages in guild and private chat channels is now removed, it will only be active in chat channels with more than 25 users. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2512087883&amp;postId=25734529966&amp;sid=1#36))<br>
<br>
2.3 Testing<br>
The issue with the guild bank locking up when opened has been identified, and will be fixed in a later build. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2509269840&amp;postId=25749422814&amp;sid=1#37))<br>
<br>
Others<br>
Flying mounts in Azeroth seems to definitely be something Blizzard wants to implement at some point. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2040217823&amp;postId=25734528161&amp;sid=1#6))<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, two set bonuses got changed, probably in the first build of the 2.3 PTR but I never reported them.<br>
<br>
Paladin Tier 5 (Healing)<br>
(2) Set: Each time you cast a Judgement, your party members gain 50 mana.<br>
Old bonus: Increases the armor granted by your Devotion Aura ability by 350.<br>

Old bonus: Reduces the casting time of your Holy Light spell by 0.2 sec.<br>
<br>
Shaman Tier 5 (Healing)<br>

Old bonus: Reduces the cost of your Lesser Healing Wave spell by 3%.<br>

Unlimited Escapism vol. 0: Shock Your Senses<br>
It&apos;s been a long time since the last video posted in news ! Anyway, Baron Soosdon released another volume of Unlimited Escapism (http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=48525), as usual it&apos;s really really nice, and you&apos;ll probably enjoy it if you liked the others. <br>
