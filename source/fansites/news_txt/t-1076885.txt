Love Is in the Air once again! The event starts on February 5 and ends February 18 and brings us a new mount this year: the Swift Lovebird ! See below for more details!




Love Token Rewards
The same Love Token  rewards as last year are available, with the addition of the new Swift Lovebird  mount for those of you who really really like pink.



The Romantic Picnic Basket  will let you enjoy a romantic meal with your loved one for Love Token  x 10.
Love Fool  drops a Love Dummy on the ground, it lasts 15 seconds and costs Love Token  x 10. The item has unlimited uses Nevermind, it's one use only, sorry about that and will disappear after 10 days or when Love is in the Air ends. 
The Dinner Suit Box  and Lovely Dress Box  will provide you with fine clothing for Love Token  x 20 each.
Truesilver Shafted Arrow  rewards you with the Peddlefeet  companion pet! Costs Love Token  x 40.
Last but not least, Swift Lovebird  is a new mount introduced this year and costs Love Token  x 270.



        

  

A few important things to keep in mind:



If you have a lot of money and don't feel like farming Love Token , you can buy Lovely Charm Bracelet  from other players and exchange them for Love Token  at any Love is in the Air rewards NPC without any limit. If you really want to show off on your server and be the first with the mount, that's the way to go. 
The Swift Lovebird  mount and the Truesilver Shafted Arrow  companion pets are not bind on pick up and can be bought at the Auction House. Obviously, it also means the event is a good opportunity to farm something valuable and sell it if you're short on cash. 
Don't forget the other mount, Big Love Rocket  from the daily dungeon encounter! 



Crown Chemical Co. Encounter Rewards
The Crown Chemical Co. Encounter is now available in your Dungeon Finder and you can run the event as much as you want to get one of the rare necklaces. As far as we know they haven't been updated this year and it's very likely that you have something better than the ilvl 346 rewards you get from the encounter.

Love Is in the Air Customer Support Policy
Love is in the Air from February 5-20, and with these romantic feelings comes one of Azeroth’s many special world events! World events are a time for players to celebrate in-game holidays, acquire special vanity items or pets, and earn those much sought-after achievements. As these things are highly valued by our players, our support staff is available should things go awry. If you’d like to learn more about this event, be sure to check out our Community Blog.

There are some situations, however, in which there may be limitations to the assistance we can provide. While some of the policies below are primarily aimed at our world events, they are all in line with our other more general support policies. As always, exceptions may be made, particularly in the case of extenuating circumstances or bugs. Keep an eye out for such issues by visiting our Support Site  and searching for the issue you are experiencing, or checking the Breaking News 

Event Item Purchases
Many holidays provide special forms of currency, usually tokens or other exchangeable items, with which purchases can be made from limited availability vendors. Many of the items from these vendors may be necessary to complete achievements associated with world events, so they are often highly coveted. The majority of these items are non-refundable, and this functionality is intended. As a result, make your purchases wisely, as Game Masters will be unable to facilitate such refunds.

Achievement Related Issues
For many, world events are one of the most convenient means to acquire achievements. Achievements represent overcoming extreme odds, having a bit of luck, and generally serve as a milestone for your character to proudly show off. Achievements are, by definition, accomplishments that require skillful effort and often a non-trivial amount of time to earn. Because of the intent behind achievement design philosophy and tool limitations, Game Masters are unable to grant, remove, or alter achievements in any way.

Limited Duration Events
World events can make time fly by quickly, so make sure that you get all your achievements, quests, and special events done before it’s too late! While availability may be limited, Game Masters are only able to provide restorations if they have accompanying logs to prove that a loss occurred. If the item was never acquired or the quest never completed, a restoration isn’t usually possible.
Also bear in mind that the event end date will always be listed in your Events Calendar in-game, and the deadline corresponds with realm time, not your local time. We highly advise making certain all your tasks are completed well in advance, and wish you all the best throughout your seasonal adventures!
