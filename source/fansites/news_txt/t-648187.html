Wintergrasp Quests now Weekly<br>
Don&apos;t worry, Wintergrasp isn&apos;t really getting nerfed, the quest rewards are being changed to fit the new frequency. (Yes, you actually get 20 Stone Keeper Shard for a single quest now)<br>
In an effort to better balance the amount of players that are in Wintergrasp at any given time, we are changing the daily quests in Wintergrasp to a weekly format. This has led to an increase in the honor reward given by these quests as well as additional Stone Keeper&apos;s Shards. These quests will reset every Tuesday morning at 3:00 AM.<br>
<br>
There are two known issues that may occur once these changes are pushed to live realms:<br>
<br>
The quest mark will now show as gold, even though the quests are repeatable.<br>
After the quests reset, players near the NPC quest givers may need to move out of line of sight in order for the quests to properly appear.<br>

General<br>
New art textures have been added for Argent Tournament mounts. Any mounts already purchased from the Argent Tournament vendors will be updated automatically. Argent Tournament mounts with the old textures will still be available for purchase from the Argent Tournament vendors for a small Champion&#x2019;s Seal and gold cost (standard faction requirements apply).<br>
Copied Test Realm characters will no longer be copied with their achievement history in order to better facilitate the character copy process.<br>
<br>
Equipment Manager<br>
When enabled from the Interface Options menu, this feature will allow players to store sets of equipment, easily swap between saved sets using hotkeys, and pull items directly from backpacks or bank slots (must be at the bank to equip inventory from the bank).<br>
<br>
PVP<br>
Vehicle health and damage output in Strand of the Ancients and Lake Wintergrasp now scale with the item level of the operator&#x2019;s gear. Power scaling is now 1% damage and 1% health per average item level.<br>
All Lake Wintergrasp daily quests have been changed to a weekly format. The honor and Stone Keeper&#x2019;s Shards rewarded for completing these quests have been increased to compensate.<br>

(Even if this change is still in the official notes, it was reverted in an earlier PTR version and this might be a small mistake in the official note update.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin<br>

MMO-Champion now on Facebook<br>
After the success of the Steam Group (http://steamcommunity.com/groups/mmo-champion) I just couldn&apos;t stop here. MMO-Champion is now on Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=80351072309)! I also have a few ideas in mind for that group depending on how popular it gets. <br>

Blue posts<br>
Healing in Raids<br>
On the one hand, when a raid wipes it may always feel like it&apos;s your fault because people ultimately died and you&apos;re the ones supposed to stop people from dying. I&apos;m not saying we make healing on raid content trivial. We don&apos;t. We want it to be a challenge. We want you to have to work at it and feel good when you finally get a new boss down. We want you to feel like the gear that drops is rewarding because you notice the difference.<br>
<br>
But I also think you&apos;re being a little unfair to dps to tanking. There are berserk timers on many bosses and it&apos;s the job of the dps to hit those timers. You can&apos;t necessarily solve that through healing expect by virtue of keeping them up and stabbing. On some fights all they are doing is damage, but on others they have to kill the right targets, or maximize their damage at the right moment (say XT&apos;s heart). They need to avoid AE damage. Mimiron&apos;s rockets do what 5 million damage?! If someone dies in that and asks &quot;WHY U NOT HELZ ME?&quot; you have my permission to reach through Vent and clock them on the skull. Tanking isn&apos;t easy either. If your tank fails to pick up adds and they run around one-shotting folks, that is not your responsibility to keep them standing. If they die with Last Stand or Icebound Fortitude not on cooldown, then they might need a tiny nibble of L2P.<br>
<br>
I&apos;ve played all three roles quite a bit, and I don&apos;t find one to be hands down harder than another. I think tanking and healing are probably more stressful. You have to be ready from the pull -- you can&apos;t take a few seconds before you jump into things.<br>
<br>
Healing isn&apos;t for everyone. It takes a certain mindset. You aren&apos;t always going to be celebrated the way the rogue on top of the damage meters is. But every good guild knows it rests on the ability of its healers. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16903658381-question-about-healer-philosophy.html))<br>
<br>
Armor Penetration Cap<br>
There are caps to armor pen, but the total amount of armor that can be reduced is not one of them. The numbers you need to really to get armor pen to the point where it feels broken cannot really be done with available gear. <br>
<br>
[...] There is a cap per point. You can&apos;t ignore more than a certain percentage of the armor per point. This is what keeps armor pen from being better vs. targets with lower armor.<br>
<br>
There is no cap on the amount of armor pen from which you can benefit. More points of armor pen always give you more damage (in the way more AP always gives you more damage, but more hit does not).<br>
<br>
We are familiar with some of the theorycrafting for how great armor pen might be for fully Ulduar-geared melee. We&apos;re not worried about it yet because it&apos;s a big improvement over armor pen being a junk stat, which is where it was for many until recently.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re not too worried about the double trinket proc in PvP. It&apos;s impossible to use on demand, you have to give your PvP trinket to do it, and it still isn&apos;t better vs. lightly armored targets, which is what we wanted to fix.

Feral Cat DPS too high?<br>
The theoretical Feral dps suggested by simulations may be high because the reality is often different -- it&apos;s a pretty demanding spec to play and more dependent on attacks from behind than most.<br>
<br>
We don&apos;t often see cats beating rogues. They do sometimes beat mages, locks and hunters, but that is almost always on fights where we asked the ranged dps to be doing something else, such as moving or contending with adds. There are also some early fights in Ulduar that are very friendly to kitties, such as XT and Razorscale.<br>
<br>
It&apos;s definitely something to keep an eye on. If we made a small nerf to cat dps, nobody should be surprised, but we don&apos;t have one to announce at this time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16903518396-feral-dps-supposed-to-be-this-high-89k-dps.html))<br>

Ammo Changes<br>
Those are all still in the plan. We are always very reluctant to provide timelines unless we have some confidence that we can deliver. The community tends to be a tad unforgiving unless we offer a lot of caveats on everything we &#x201C;promise.&#x201D; I can understand how it can be difficult to be patient, but just realize the alternative is not that they get done faster but that we keep our ideas really close to the chest until they are about to go in the game. Some players would prefer this method of communication, which is understandable. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904206957-hunter-balanceblizzards-opinion--attempt-2.html))<br>
<br>
Pets scaling from Crit / Armor Penetration / Agility / AP / Haste<br>
Yes, we agree with all of that (more or less). The barrier in this case is technical -- it&apos;s just not set up to work that way, so it&apos;s not a quick change. But we would like to eventually get that fixed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904206957-hunter-balanceblizzards-opinion--attempt-2.html))<br>
<br>
Pet DPS<br>
We don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a strong design to have too much of your dps tied up in the pet, because then you are really crippled when it dies and we aren&#x2019;t going to provide you with 100% certainty that that isn&#x2019;t going to happen. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904206957-hunter-balanceblizzards-opinion--attempt-2.html))<br>
<br>
Steady Shot vs. Auto Shot<br>
We&#x2019;ve been over this ground before, but it&#x2019;s actually irrelevant if Steady does more or less damage than Auto since you can use them both together (unless it just offends your sensibilities or something). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904206957-hunter-balanceblizzards-opinion--attempt-2.html))<br>
<br>
Glyph of the Monkey<br>
We think the Glyph of the Monkey was just too good. It made more sense back when you had to go to Monkey. But we didn&#x2019;t want to keep that restriction when the whole point of Dragonhawk was to make you not have to shift Aspects all of the time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904206957-hunter-balanceblizzards-opinion--attempt-2.html))<br>
<br>
Roar of Sacrifice<br>
We can understand how Roar of Sacrifice was cool because it gave you some utility you could share with the rest of your team. Maybe there is some way to bring back that functionality, possibly in a different ability. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904206957-hunter-balanceblizzards-opinion--attempt-2.html))</div></div>
