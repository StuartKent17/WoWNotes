Throne of Thunder Heroic Progression
No real progress today, only Exorsus http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%83%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D1%84%D1%8C%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B4/%D0%AD%D0%BA%D0%B7%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%81%D1%83%D1%81 moving up to 10/13 bosses down. WoWProgress changed their ranking system http://www.wowprogress.com/post/135_Improved_Scoring_for_Tier15_the_Long_Version, explaining why a 9/13 guild is ranked higher than a 10/13 guild in the listing.

Addon: Satchel Scanner
After talking about satchel contents yesterday http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3166-Patch-5-2-and-Raid-Finder-Satchels-5-2-Hotfixes-ToT-Progression-Blue-Tweets-Comic, now is a good time to talk about getting the [Misty Satchel of Exotic Mysteries] http://www.wowdb.com/items/90818-misty-satchel-of-exotic-mysteries! There is an addon called Satchel Scanner http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/satchel-scanner that can keep an eye on the LFD frame and alert you if it is currently being offered. 

Using it is pretty simple, open the config, check the roles you are interested in, and start the scan. When the satchel comes up, it will alert you with a raid warning and sound. You can show or hide the panel with "/ss3 toggle", allowing it to continue scanning in the background. 

More options are coming in a future version http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/satchel-scanner?comment=44, so be sure to send the author feedback if you want some more features!

Why do all "fun" items have such long cooldowns?
Much of the time, 'fun' items are nerfed to prevent an exploit of one sort or another. 

Cheaters are why you can't have nice things. Well, they're still pretty nice, just not as often. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257268-why-do-all-fun-items-have-such-long-cds/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8197762873?page=1#19

Glorious Tyranny PvP Enchant
Could you please explain why there is a weapon enchant that is only viable for melees? Isnt that a bit unfair against casters? 
Honestly, I have mixed feelings about this enchant http://www.wowdb.com/items/95349-enchant-weapon-glorious-tyranny. 

Once we’ve switched the way Elite gear becomes available to players from the 2200 rating requirement to 27000 Conquest Point requirement, we felt the need to add something cosmetic, to visually distinguish high rated players from the rest, it’s just a cool thing to do and players were clearly asking for it, recognition is generally a good thing, it values people and it’s very motivational.

So the issue I have with this is that we’ve changed the way players can buy Elite gear, partially because ilvl disparity in PvP only helps to further increase itself, once players start to get Elite gear, the gap between those players and the ones still trying to grab it, widens, and it gets harder to beat those players.

So what does this have to do with the enchant? Well, the enchant was introduced as one of those visually distinguishable features exclusively available to high rated players, which causes 2 problems:

- If the enchant is too good for PvP, it will reintroduce the first problem that we’ve tried to solve back into the equation.
- If it’s too bad for PvP, no high rated player will want to use it, so the item becomes pointless.

So for this to actually work in its current form it simply needs to be on par with top PvE Enchants. This sort of balance can be hard to achieve, especially when we have static stats and characters that can duel-wield and others that cannot, so it’s not just about casters vs melee.

We’re aware of the issues being reported about this enchant and about not having more cosmetic perks to make high rated players stand out from the crowd. We’ll make sure to pass your feedback along to devs. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257097-honor-bought-malevolent-weapons/ / Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6892931124?page=3#56

Catch Up Speed
And where was the problem with this? Isn't that the way games should be? You start at the beginning and go through all of the content in a specific order. Which game, except actual WoW, no matter whether on- or offline, allows you to leave out content and go directly to the final bosses? 
With that route specifically? It was on the fact that if you came late to the game you didn't really have any way of catch-up to get into more advanced guilds, other than try to actually run that content when perhaps most guilds at that point had already moved past.

If you flash forward to Cataclysm, it probably isn't crazy to argue that it was too easy to bypass entire tiers by going into the Patch 4.3 5-man dungeons, sure. 

If you flash forward to the present.... 
In Pandaria, now you do have to run that content, but the availability of tools as the Raid Finder and increased drop rates in previous raids means that while you're following that same route as players were doing in Vanilla WoW you're doing it at a quicker pace and even without the need of finding a guild running that content, looking for applicants and on the same time of the day you can raid.

So, it's not that there was something wrong with going through that route in my opinion, I shall add, but, the fact there weren't many ways to bypass content meant that, the higher you went on that progress, the less guilds were around progressing, hence, less players were ready to experience that content.
