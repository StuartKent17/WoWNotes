Mythic Item Level<br>
I&apos;ve seen most groups ask for people at 305 to 315ish that&apos;s just my experience though and I can see people asking for higher. <br>
<br>
Honestly they&apos;re very doable under 300 as long as you can follow mechanics and figure out some strats with your group.<br>
<br>
If I was doing a World Tour with all pugs, I would aim to have the group be all 320.<br>
I would ask for something similar if we were doing a World Tour. Some of the dungeons are a bit harder than the others and can be pretty challenging at lower ilvls but for the most part they&apos;re pretty doable and similar to the heroic counterparts in difficulty.
