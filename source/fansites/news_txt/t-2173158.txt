have there been any ideas to make galakras in SoO skippable so we can actually solo it. Much like the valithria encounter in icc
Have you tried it recently? Patch 7.1 should have let you bring the drake down with a single cannon. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/831243393267142658

No highmountain tribes in over a week yet we've had the dreamweavers twice, why is this system so screwed up?
In a system with 7 entries, some fortnights you can have the cycle be ABCDEFG|EDFCGBA, A being Highmountain. Because math. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/831651625609551872
It would be better to have emissaries set as days to ensure rep dispersion across the factions than having no emissary for a week+
This system already ensures even distribution of all emissaries over time. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/831653735113764864

Misc
We have riding mounts, flying mounts and swimming ones. Have you guys ever thought about a new type? Climbing? Leaping?
mounts should be able to roll affixes like items, so you can get a leaping white stallion or a vicious frolicking war turtle Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/831179522250649600


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
What makes wow the best? What is it about wow that no other MMORPG got right?
The biggest challenge in my mind for MMO design is being able to create stuff for players to do faster than they can consume it.

Even WoW canâ€™t solve that problem completely, but it was the closest I have ever seen. WoW always gave players a ton of things to do. Not only were there dozens of quest zones, but you could actually go do them all without having to find a group first. In previous MMOs, youâ€™d hit the point where youâ€™re intended to just go slaughter frogs or whatever to gain the next level. WoW never hit those dry points. 

On the other hand, if you did find a group, there were dungeons to run or BGs to jump into. At launch, just looking behind waterfalls or trying to get up cliffs where we werenâ€™t supposed to go was fairly entertaining. 

A lot of people, including me, like to point out the ridiculous level of polish that Blizzard puts into games, and I definitely think that is part of WoWâ€™s secret sauce. But for me, the reason I kept playing, is that after Redridge, there was Stranglethorn to explore, and after I got tired of my hunter, there as a priest to try, and after I was sick of UBRS, I could try my hand at LBRS. And then I discovered raiding, and whole new ways to play were on the table. And when I wasnâ€™t raiding, I needed to farm flasks and Whipper Root Tubers or see if I could get the shield to drop in UBRS. Or I could work on my engineering or I could consider grinding factions. Or I could see if there was any PvP happening around Tyrâ€™s Hand. Or try Dire Maul. And just when I was sick of wiping to Naxxramas, an expansion was announced.

Like a lot of players, my WoW-playing started to shift from just logging on to see what was happening to logging on only for raid nights or the like. But I donâ€™t think I would have developed those friendships if I hadnâ€™t already been spending so much time in the game before that point.

I played a lot of games like Civilization, XCOM and Diablo before I discovered WoW, but I felt like I had seen everything there was to see in those games pretty quickly, even though I stuck with them. With WoW, there was always the sense that I was going to discover a new troll ruin or a new rare drop or see some rare spawn for the first time. I also didnâ€™t want to miss out if I heard about my friends seeing all of that stuff the one night I chose not to log in.
