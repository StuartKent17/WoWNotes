Warlords of Draenor - Weekly Story Quests
It looks like there will be even more reasons to log in frequently in Warlords of Draenor, as there will be weekly story quests!
Finally met up with Azuka Bladefury, a female Warlord, in Nagrand
You'll be seeing much more of her during level 100 weekly story quests. craig_amai 
Weekly short stories that tap into our many level 100 spaces. Many different subjects, but Azuka plays a big role. craig_amai 
Do we learn about various lore each week? Are they random or a scheduled order?
Semi-scheduled intro, midpoint, and finale with randomness in between. A mix of local stories and big character stories. craig_amai 
Is it possible to 'miss' these quests? Say, by not being able to play on a given week? Possible to do them again later?
You can't miss them. If you skip a week and it rerolls something else, you'll still get it again later. craig_amai 


Warlords of Draenor - Black Market Auction House
The Black Market Auction House has moved from Pandaria to the Ring of Blood in Nagrand for Warlords of Draenor. 

Kalidiar has noted  some interesting new items for sale, such as Tabard of the Arcane , Grimoire of the Four Winds , Swift Razzashi Raptor , and more.

Classes
New major glyphs coming for defensive dispels in #Warlords. 2 charges but increases cooldown by 4 seconds. Courtesy of & co. holinka 
Bad idea if reducing cc. Also, can you stop adding glyphs like this. Priests have more mandatory glyphs than we can use
we'd be pretty happy if everyone had more than three "mandatory" glyphs holinka 

Do you ever think you went too far with ability pruning?
Not sure. Playing some classes on beta, I really love the extra action bar space and streamlined nature of the classes. holinka 

Melee uptime seems really high. Dmg is high from some melee but I assume you have a series of numbers passes to do. Good stuff.
there is tuning but have heard a lot of concerns about melee mobility...but I don't think it's all melee. holinka 

Any mobility changes planned for next build?
We probably need to start getting more specific than "mobility" at this point. Some melee are great here, others are not. holinka 

On live I can go 10 min with almost no empty gcd. On beta I already had more empty gcd in less than 2 min testing.
There's quite a few tiers of difference involved there. That's normal. Celestalon 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Purpose of "Enhanced Will of the Necropolis"? Are dk tanks designed to drop below 30% every 30 secs?
"Designed to", no. Able to benefit from Will of the Necropolis that often, yes. Celestalon 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
maybe when the ww numbers start to drop you guys will agree. Blizzard sold us a "fast pacing street fighter style".
.Threats like that have long lost their sway over us. It's still a fast-based combat spec. People are are spreading this idea... Celestalon 
...that Windwalkers are some slow spec now that is energy starved. That's not at all the case. It's simply not. Celestalon 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Attack speed from Empowered seals doesn't have any effect on Crusader Strike cooldown in beta. Intended?
Yes; attack speed is not haste. Celestalon 
It isn't worth to seal-dance then, is it? Thank you for your answer.
It should still be. Tuning may be off. Celestalon 

1 Can you give me a PvE scenario where Seraphim > FV/EmpS? I really don't see it beating them even after...
You find the pooling/burst gameplay fun, you want bursts semi-frequent of damage. Celestalon 
Even if you could call it funyou can't, damagewhich it lacks trumps fun on and serious progression
Tuning hasn't happened yet. Celestalon 

Art
the basilisks, warpstalkers and tallstriders of draenor will have new model? please they need one, thanks
We tried to update as many iconic creatures as possible, sadly we could not get them all. _DonAdams 

PvP
you mentioned a "cool new feature" you hadn't shared yet...still coming, or did I miss something?
Still coming...but there have been hints out there. holinka 

I've been around since Day one - I would love to see stats that show me I'm wrong and PvP is not a niche
In the US and EU, the number of people doing random battlegrounds is as high or more than LFR. holinka 
likewise as many people do 2s as normal raiding. As many do 3s as heroic raiding. Not a niche. holinka 
and the number of people doing 5's is the same as those doing CM's?
Yeah very few people do 5s and we don't think it is very good gameplay either holinka 
Does that number filter out people doing only the legendary quest?
This was the trend before the legendary quest holinka 

wod why are incaps and disorients seperate DRs? promotes caster cleaves with moonkin or wl. if combined: melee+ranged best comps
A lot of history with those DR categories. Not prepared to make that seismic of a shift. holinka 
reading from your comment that i'm right essentially, but the change would be too much for now. right?
No not really. The game has been working pretty well with those DR categories. Don't feel such a disruptive change is needed. holinka 

so basically Ashran is a AoE fest with PvE mobs thrown into the mix for fun?
It's important to note that we're trying to offer a new type of experience with Ashran including the "giant zerg" feel holinka 
it isn't for everyone but some people REALLY like it. Variety is the spice of life...in WoW holinka 
Also regarding the zerg, spell clutter culling will be coming soon, and that'll help with the visual soup. Celestalon 

Are the Vicious Saddle mounts going to be obtainable in WoD as well, or will they get replaced by new mounts?
still obtainable holinka 

Lore
Reading the Talador preview. Is the Kirin Tor neutral again in WoD?
Khadgar is. He wants to get the politics out of the Kirin-Tor. DaveKosak 
Can't you just make him a alliance hero that is willing to work with the Horde for the greater good.
That's exactly what he is. DaveKosak 

Will we see the ettin in Draenor WoD? Thanks .
No ettins, but we have Ogronn, Lesser Gronn don't think that's the real name Gronn and Magnaron. Many giants! _DonAdams 
Why no Ettins? WoD is as good a time as ever to explain their existence.
There is evidence that they're in the ogre/ogronn/gronn family. That's all anyone knows. _DonAdams 

Didn't the Arakkoa try to summon an Old God to Outland so why isn't he showing up????
The Dark Conclave doesn't exist yet. Most arakkoa do not worship Old Gods. At least not at the time of WoD BC -30 years. _DonAdams 

Who are the Scorpars? beasts o humanoids scorpions? we will see them? 
Creatures we ended up cutting. You won't see them in WoD. At least not at launch... _DonAdams 
To clarify: MAYBE NEVER. _DonAdams 

So is Sethe who the arakkoa in Outland's SMV were trying to summon?
Nope. That was Dark Conclave trying to summon an unnamed Old God. Sethe is a primal god worshipped by the Sethekk _DonAdams 
Is that Old God planned to show up in WoD? I.e. is he native to Draenor?
No plans for him at the moment. The arakkoa may not even be in contact with him yet. We don't know. 

Reputation / Questing
Hi!, is the ending for FFR under redesigning? We've never been able to see it/test it, while SMV has an ending with Karabor.
Not being redesigned. The finale for Frostfire has an amazing in-game cinematic which we have not yet revealed. craig_amai 

World
Then... Why have them next to the giant PvP zone? Why not just make it hard by distance, which Kara/BSF provides.
Seeing other players is totally cool, see: Dalaran. Flying to stuff because your hub is not near anything isn't cool. Muffinus 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Ashran the island off the coast? Seems like you put the hub far from everything...
Looking at fast ways to get from your garrison to Ashran hub. Keep in mind: Garrison is in SMV/FF, you see a lot of them. Muffinus 
So World > Garrison > Hub is the intended path to take this expansion?
The endgame of WoD has yet to be unveiled - you'll be fighting all over, think 5.1+Timeless Isle combined Muffinus 

Dave... Alex... Why is there suddenly, what appears to be, a portal to the Emerald Nightmare near Stormwind?
OOOoooo mystery!! Will make sense once all the dungeons are in. DaveKosak 

are we going to have intact draenei cities outside of shadowmoon? ie shattrath a neutral hub?
I believe there are some in Talador? Smaller pockets of resistance, at least. _DonAdams 

Will The Dark Portal in Outland fade away? Thanks .
Well the portal in Blasted Lands now links to Draenor Tanaan Jungle but as for the Hellfire portal... good question. _DonAdams 

Garrisons
Oh so will my faction Leaders randomly show up garrison? No? Ok well how about access to my bank? No? <con>
If you've played the beta, you've seen Thrall/Durotan there. So yes, they do Storehouse gives you bank acc Muffinus 

the ability to destroy our forces while being united
This is why you're building a garrison, Ashran isn't half of the story of what you're ultimately building up to in future. Muffinus 
I still disagree with moving the capitols to Ashran but okay
The capitol is really your garrison, it's where you start from, where many things intersect, and ultimately = winning vs ??? Muffinus 

So, do we get a target dummy at some point in those garrisons? 
If you take the Sparring Arena, yes! Muffinus 

Normal Garrison missions are 30m, I just got a rare mission with an 8 hour duration! Intended?
Longer time, epic-er rewards Muffinus 


Computers - Setup of the Month
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices  are trending slightly downward over the past few months, with all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. 

The Haswell refresh is here for non-overclockable CPUs, with the overclockable versions likely coming in the next few months. These may offer somewhat better overclocking performance, which may worth waiting for if you are overclocking to the limits of air cooling.

The new Haswell Refresh CPUs  are here and just like their predecessors they run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4790K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions! If you are interested in Folding@home, take a look in our team's thread
