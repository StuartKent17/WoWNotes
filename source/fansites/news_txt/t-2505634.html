Forbes has an interview (https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2019/08/26/warcraft-classic-layering-and-realm-queues-ion-hazzikostas-explains-why-youre-waiting-to-log-in/) with Ion Hazzikostas about layering and launch day.<br>
<br>
<br>
Layering is the lesser of several evils when it comes to handling launch week populations.<br>
Many people have been waiting for this launch for years and are committed to the long haul, but there will also be tons of tourists checking it out at launch.<br>
The team is predicting a fairly steep drop off compared to the interest players are showing on launch day.<br>
Community is very important in Classic, so keeping the number of realms reasonable to ensure a healthy population is important. <br>
The team really really wants to avoid having to offer transfers or merging Classic realms later.<br>
Raising player caps on realms could be done but causes contention for finite spawn points and leads to bottlenecks. <br>
When you log in, you&apos;ll be assigned to a layer and will stay there for that gameplay session. <br>
The only way to change layers will be accepting a group invite from a player in another layer. Once you move to that new layer, that&apos;ll be your new layer for the gameplay session.<br>
The team expects to aggressively reduce the number of layers after the first few days.<br>
As the team goes into Phase 2, the goal is to have just one layer per realm.<br>
Layers will be removed with realm restarts or during maintenance. <br>

US and Oceanic - New WoW Classic Realms are Now Open<br>
Due to very high demand, we&#x2019;ve opened two new WoW Classic realms in this region:<br>
<br>
Ashkandi - Normal - Eastern<br>
Kirtonos - PvP - Eastern<br>
Rattlegore - PvP - Pacific<br>
Kurinnaxx &#x2013; PvP - Pacific<br>
Kromcrush &#x2013; PvP &#x2013; Eastern<br>
Yojamba - PvP - AEST<br>
<br>
We suggest that players choosing a realm consider one of these, as other realms currently marked as &#x201C;Full&#x201D; population will experience extended queues.<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>
