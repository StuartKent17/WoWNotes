PvP<br>
if we level in legion through BGs or skirms, will we work towards the honor to prestige early or does that start at 110?<br>
Starts at 110 (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/682009047583690757))<br>

Rewards<br>
Hmm, people hated ridiculous RNG with regards to X. Maybe they&apos;ll like it if it&apos;s ridiculous RNG on Y instead!<br>
RNG Realtalk: it&apos;s been a staple of RPGs for years, it exists and can even be exciting (see: Ashes of Al&apos;ar), is it good? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682092506339618816))<br>
sure, but there&apos;s a diff between a rare drop of loot, and an item with a low-single-digits drop chance once per year.<br>
Some players have tweeted that they like the rarity, appreciate the social value of showing off their rare loot. Valid? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682093637656690688))<br>
Not trying to sound like a jerk, just putting this towards you as a developer on twitter, and what you do! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682093932226822144))<br>
Is it the majority, or even a significant minority? I know I personally see more RNG hate than rarity love 1/2<br>
Does it matter? When is the minority right? When is the majority? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682094534268878849))<br>
&quot;Right&quot; is subjective here. Very subjective. Majority tends to win in subjective matters, particularly in regards to product prefs<br>
I think if the majority of players feel a negative feeling towards something, there is something wrong, even if it&apos;s not that. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682095353408000000))<br>
But that might be confirmation bias. Still, strikes me as something that might be a bit TOO rare. Ashes et al is 52/year.<br>
I think there is an intrinsic &quot;effort value&quot; that goes into rewards that can be obtained multiple times. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682094860153667590))<br>
Once/year/character feels like luck, one/day/character feels like effort. The latter is more satisfying, even if you don&apos;t win? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682095010334904320))<br>
Rewards from effort/repetition are almost always more rewarding, long-term, then rewards from strike-of-lightning luck.<br>
Yet we&apos;ve had a resurgence in the requests for random Legendaries, recalling HOR, TF, glaives, etc. Different? Same? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682095731407106048))<br>
Or just nostalgia? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682095831831330816))<br>
Casinos don&apos;t have machines that only give one try per visit/day. No one plays them. People play repetitive luck games, rabidly.<br>
(FWIW it will be moved to the Stolen Present next year, same with all of the new-per-year gifts) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682096421110022144))<br>
Casinos don&apos;t have machines that only give one try per visit/day. No one plays them. People play repetitive luck games, rabidly.<br>
I don&apos;t know if you, ethically, want to model your system after casinos. Where&apos;s the line? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682096536952549376))<br>
Example, if bonus roll tokens were a 1% chance instead of the ~20% chance they are now, how many people do you think would bother?<br>
Related: the droprates for Pandaren rares were 10-30%. Timeless Isle they were much less, but lasted for longer. Which was better (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682098344122945536))<br>
And Huolon was the big one. Low droprate, but he could be farmed every ~45m. Not once per year.<br>
I still can&apos;t believe people figured out that you could albatross troll and pull from atop the bridge, emergent gameplay++ (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682099063722909696))<br>
Poor comparison, since timeless isle was a lot of &quot;well, there&apos;s nothing else to do&quot;.<br>
Prefer Tanaan? Cata endgame? WOTLK? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682098793676804100))<br>
So ya, Tanaan washed not because of design (which was REALLY good for dailies), but lack of long-term rewards.<br>
Maybe day-to-day variance in the events in each area? Let predictability not just in which area, but what you do while there?<br>
We had a lot of this in MOPs endgame, how did that feel? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682100431154053122))<br>
.I personally *much* preferred the MoP endgame, in 5.0-5.2, TI/apexis/tanaan, had no story, and are boring IMO :/<br>
To me, Story is the main thing we need to learn from this. Please check out World Quests/reps in Legion (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682114366678773760))<br>
World needs to feel &quot;alive&quot;.<br>
Yep (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682114680899276803))<br>
.tanaan was just apexis dailies, nothing fun in regards to mechanics, again, IMO.<br>
I agree with you both, btw Please check out the World Quests system in Legion (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682118009901613056))<br>
<br>
Raiding<br>
Some interesting comments in your alts though - why can you do nothing with them but LFR? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682099860506456064))<br>
Well, if they are geared enough to do normal+, they don&apos;t need upgrade tokens. If they need tokens, can&apos;t get into normal.<br>
If you could make one change to make normal PUGs a reality, what would you change? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682100635211182081))<br>
So getting runs on alts that are actually at appropriate itemlevel for the difficulty is frustrating, especially as DPS.<br>
True, ilvl is a shortcut to dps, but isn&apos;t 100% accurate. If you could replace the ilvl system, what would you do? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682101381256224768))<br>
But how do you grade that? Lots of mechanics were some people standing in bad is good, or required, but many isn&apos;t<br>
Standing in Fire has also gotten a lot more complex over time. Compare Patchwerk to Blackfuse. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682106006801760256))<br>
Mr. Feasel, with all due respect you surely see that Ilvl is the new GS?<br>
Yep, and there needs to be ways to combat this. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682115120235823104))<br>
Covered that. But community wants their yard stick. Take away one, they&apos;ll make another. AotC already that way.<br>
The design goal is thus: what is the most effective unit of measurement, if there is one? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682115469101240322))<br>
Loath to add more queues. I *LIKE* the new Group Finder tool. Still, begs the question with the community grades off meters.<br>
Yeah the &quot;I can&apos;t apply for a job because I haven&apos;t had a job because I can&apos;t apply for a job&quot; problem is alive and well in MMOs (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682102923954765824))<br>
*Maybe* have the system, when queued for raids, show tooltip info on your experience in that raid (account wide, all difficulties)<br>
Maybe have a Normal queueing system that operates like HOTS, matching players of lower skill with higher to average into a win? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682102160625029121))<br>
But then those players are admonished by the better players for having low DPS, and quit (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682102266686377985))<br>
Have quarter-baked idea where loot drop add per player being higher for lower-geared chars. Needs checks, but could work.<br>
This was kind of the idea behind Flex, the difficulty didn&apos;t really increase, while the players did. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682103351002071040))<br>
(c) increase mechanics, with an ilvl-based break point where a raid could still over-gear a fight (c)<br>
Increasing mechanics is scary. When you leave a mechanic out of LFR, a PUG dies to it in normal, and is kick (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682106655719358464))<br>
I think for mythic you need to have one-shot and &quot;single player can make a wipe&quot; mechanics<br>
Definitely do need them for Mythic. Norm/Hero, if you screw up, you might die. In Mythic, you wipe the raid.<br>
On every fight? Or can some be &quot;tank can relax&quot; fights? Or healer, dps? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682109779964104704))<br>
Forgiveness fluctuates per role per fight, certainly. DPS low responsibility on Iskar. Tanks low on Council.<br>
TBH, back in the day, I really appreciated the contrast (as a dps) of Patchwerk vs. Loatheb (1.0, fire mage) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682110758675582978))<br>
even if that person is normally very good, with 20 players, high % chance someone can have an off moment<br>
Alex Afrasiabi introduced me to this concept of &quot;skill entropy,&quot; smart dude (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682111800414879745))<br>
<br>
Or did you mean an automated SimC-type thing in-game. Isn&apos;t that reinforcing DPS-output = worth?<br>
Perhaps there&apos;s a way to gauge performance and apply a value that more accurately reflects it... (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682104578460921862))<br>
Maybe there&apos;s even a way to incorporate a positive outlook into it? And/or a leadership quality? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682104734807789568))<br>
Sounds like a Karma system. Which *could* work, but requires player engagement, which typically requires rewards.<br>
Has it worked for LoL? Good case study on cutting-edge social engineering. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682105372769816576))<br>
