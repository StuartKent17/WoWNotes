When you zone into the raid instance you start out, as Alliance, at a small alliance base with lady Jaine Proudmoore and lots of 70 elites, including horsemen, dwarf riflemen, NE priests, bloodelf Sorceress' ?.

The starting area is standard alliance structures, few towers and buildings, think Theramore. You start the encounter and rush out to fight Undead - a few 70 elite abominations naxx are the first encounter.
