Orcs and Humans vs Other Races<br>
What&apos;s your opinion on this? Metzen stated in his interview that only orcs and humans matter, so why do we even have the other races? Aesthetics?<br>
You didn&apos;t just quote him out of context. You changed the meaning of what he said altogether:<br>
<br>
http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/03/30/chris-metzen-on-mists-of-pandarias-story-and-why-the-players-are-the-real-villains/<br>
<br>
Chris Metzen: &quot;...the pillars of the franchise are orcs and humans; it really is the Alliance and Horde by extension, and it really is those two groups beating the brains out of each other for an extended period of time. That&#x2019;s always gotta be what Warcraft is about...&quot;<br>
<br>
He&apos;s saying that the franchise began with orcs and humans. Those two races are the pillars upon which the Alliance and Horde were built. But the story has progressed and evolved so much since Warcraft: Orcs and Humans. Just because the faction rivalry has its foundations in a war between two races doesn&apos;t mean we think no other races matter.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m not saying his statements shouldn&apos;t be up for discussion. But I beg you not to start the discussion based on a false pretense.<br>
<br>
Why, exactly would I want to follow a king who is not only thousands of years younger, but who you claim was deliberately written to be [a jerk].<br>
This, again, can be drawn back to my reason for responding to this thread. You don&apos;t have the exact quote, but you&apos;re claiming we said Varian was written to be an [expletive deleted]. I don&apos;t know what quote you&apos;re referring to because, well, neither do you it seems. But I think I know where the general phrase you picked up on came from.<br>
<br>
Chris said in interviews during the Mists of Pandaria press tour that Varian was written with several character flaws, and we expected him to have likability issues. The whole point was to create a character who was a little rough around the edges. It makes for a more interesting story when you see a flawed individual rise up to the challenges of being a truly great leader, which is what we have in store for Varian this expansion. So it was important for us to give him a bit of dimension in terms of personality.<br>
<br>
Now, sure, I&apos;m paraphrasing what Chris said as well. The difference here though is I sat in with him on multiple interviews where he relayed this sentiment. So my paraphrasing is more accurate than yours.<br>
<br>
If what he was saying has been taken &quot;out of context&quot; then why are you making such efforts to ensure humans and orcs are always the &quot;guys in charge&quot; or superior to everyone else?<br>
We&apos;re not going out of our way to ensure they&apos;re always the ones in charge. But that&apos;s been the natural progression since the Horde were founded more or less under absolute rule by the most powerful chief of the most powerful orc clan. <br>
<br>
And even the High King idea (which frankly shatters what many feel is the thematic of an Alliance) seems to support this idea.<br>
Similar to what I said about the Horde above, the Alliance formed an allegiance around human kingdoms. If you&apos;re suggesting they&apos;re thematically better served by a republic or democracy, Azeroth lore says otherwise.

Quest Rewards: Spec-Specific Loot<br>
Some trinkets do silly things like summon a medic or get your character drunk or shoot a rainbow. While not that great for every clsss in combat, having these toys to have fun with is always a nice option. That staff will last two hours, but the trinket is priceless.<br>
If there is a fun trinket, we will make sure it is available to everyone as a choice for precisely this reason. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219761-quest-rewards-spec-specific-loot/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4253971218?page=8#145))<br>

Theramore Must Not Be Destroyed<br>
Oh, things will happen in Mists. Count on it.<br>
<br>
That&apos;s what we&apos;re afraid of. It has been the Alliance&apos;s experience that things happening is never a good thing.<br>
Yea, I&apos;m just kinda done empathizing with this uber-skeptical, &quot;we&apos;ve been burned before&quot; type of response to anything regarding faction content and story. The cynicism and sense of despair coming from Alliance players whenever story progression is discussed in any capacity is starting to come off a little forced. It&apos;s definitely not very useful.<br>
<br>
I couldn&apos;t help but consider player perception when choosing which spectral mount to go with as my avatar. I went with the gryphon because I didn&apos;t want to waste time reading any posts about why I chose the Horde mount. But then I thought about the potential of seeing people complain that I only chose the gryphon as an empty gesture to the Alliance. I feel like there&apos;s a metaphor in there somewhere, hah.
