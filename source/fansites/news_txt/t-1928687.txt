This Month in WoW - January 2016
Happy new year! January rings in with a bang with fireworks over the cities of Azeroth, and ends with the deep of winter. Bundle up and warm yourself by the fire of activities ahead.

In-Game Events

Feast of Winter Veil  [Ends January 2]
For the first couple of days of January, you still have an opportunity to enjoy the Feast of Winter Veil. While enjoying a freshly nutmegged cup of nog, and crunching on a crumbly cookie or two, be sure to visit Greatfather Winter in Ironforge if you’re Alliance, or Great-father Winter in Orgrimmar if you’re Horde. While there, you’ll find a few treats, and surely a few tasks to take on as well.


  

Winter Veil is the only time of the year you can acquire these pets: <a href="">Clockwork Rocket Bot</a>, <a href="">Winter Reindeer</a>, <a href="">Tiny Snowman</a>, <a href="">Winter's Little Helpers</a>, <a href="">Lump of Coal</a>.

Crafters of all stripes, rejoice! You can enhance your knowledge with these seasonal recipes: <a href="">Elixir of Frost Power</a>,&nbsp;<a href="">Edge of Winter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="">Hot Apple Cider</a>,&nbsp;<a href="">Gingerbread Cookie</a>,&nbsp;<a href="">Egg Nog</a>,<a href="">Winter's Might</a>,&nbsp;<a href="">Snowmaster 9000</a>,&nbsp;<a href="">Gloves of the Greatfather</a>,&nbsp;<a href="">Winter Boots</a>,&nbsp;<a href="">Green Winter Clothes</a>,&nbsp;<a href="">Red Winter Clothes,</a>&nbsp;<a href="">Green Holiday Shirt.&nbsp;</a>

Darkmoon Faire Returns [January 3-10]
The wondrous and mystical Darkmoon Faire returns to Azeroth on January 3, and if you haven’t completed all of Silas Darkmoon’s new Darkmoon Races, now’s the time! Test your speed and agility on a variety of racing mounts as you dodge electrifying obstacles and zip all over Darkmoon Island for rewards and achievements. You may also want to take a few moments to be a kid again by going for a ride on the new Darkmoon Seesaw.


  

The faire continues to be one of the best ways to acquire heirloom gear, and don’t forget all of the toys, mounts, and pets that can only be gotten here. Get in that cannon!

Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza  [Every Sunday at 2:00 p.m. realm time]
There can be only three winners each Sunday on each realm, but there are rewards for everyone who participates! There’s also a chance to catch rare fish during the event which Fishbot 5000 in Booty Bay will take in exchange for even more unique loot.


  

Prove that you’re one of the best anglers in Azeroth for your chance at a <a href="">Dread Pirate Ring</a>, <a href="">Hook of the Master Angler</a>, <a href="">Boots of the Bay</a>, <a href="">Arcanite Fishing Pole</a>, or <a href="">High Test Eternium Fishing Line</a>. Other players are also competing for these prizes, so time is definitely not on your side!

Why is so much utility being pruned from classes anyways? I get ability bloat.. but Utility is not bloat.
Check out the class blogs. It's unlikely that whatever you're referring to is related to 'bloat' or 'pruning'. Celestalon 
It's more likely that it's related to delivering a strong class fantasy, distinct from the others'. Celestalon 
Sometimes, we've spread something around to so many classes, it no longer feels special. Trying to solve that. Celestalon
