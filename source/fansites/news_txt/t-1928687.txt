This Month in WoW - January 2016
Happy new year! January rings in with a bang with fireworks over the cities of Azeroth, and ends with the deep of winter. Bundle up and warm yourself by the fire of activities ahead.

In-Game Events

Feast of Winter Veil http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/events/feast-of-winter-veil [Ends January 2]
For the first couple of days of January, you still have an opportunity to enjoy the Feast of Winter Veil. While enjoying a freshly nutmegged cup of nog, and crunching on a crumbly cookie or two, be sure to visit Greatfather Winter in Ironforge if you’re Alliance, or Great-father Winter in Orgrimmar if you’re Horde. While there, you’ll find a few treats, and surely a few tasks to take on as well.

Why is so much utility being pruned from classes anyways? I get ability bloat.. but Utility is not bloat.
Check out the class blogs. It's unlikely that whatever you're referring to is related to 'bloat' or 'pruning'. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/681518149628465153
It's more likely that it's related to delivering a strong class fantasy, distinct from the others'. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/681518292901715969
Sometimes, we've spread something around to so many classes, it no longer feels special. Trying to solve that. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/681518563207831556
