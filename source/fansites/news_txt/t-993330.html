<br>
We like to tie a Hunter&#x2019;s Tier armour in with an appropriate donor creature &#x2013; it suggests the Hunter has actually hunted for the set! As there&#x2019;s an awful lot of dragons in this patch, a draconic theme was the way to go. We wanted to reference but not simply reproduce the classic Dragonstalker set. To that end, we limited the use of dragon heads to the helm and chained leathery wings around the shoulders which gives the impression of a skeletal dragon crouching over the Hunter&#x2019;s upper body.<br>

VO_ET_MUROZOND_EVENT_01 - The powers of the hourglass do nothing to me!<br>

VO_ET_MUROZOND_EVENT_04 - Again?! Is this your plot? Your scheme?!<br>
VO_ET_MUROZOND_EVENT_05 - The hourglass&apos;s power is exhausted. No more games, mortals! Relent or perish.<br>

VO_ET_NOZDORMU_EVENT_04 - What matters is that Azeroth did not fall! That we survive to fight.. another day!<br>
VO_ET_NOZDORMU_EVENT_05 - All that matters.. is this moment!<br>
VO_ET_NOZDORMU_INTRO_01 - There is an unnatural darkness to this place. A perpetual midnight.. take caution heroes, and do not stray from the light.<br>
VO_ET_NOZDORMU_INTRO_02 - The undying flames are all that remain of this sacred place.. I sense much anger here. A seething rage barely held in check. Be on your guard!<br>
VO_ET_NOZDORMU_INTRO_03 - And this is all that is left of the blue dragonshrine.. a great battle shattered the timewaves leading out of this forsaken place! You must reconstruct the fragments scattered across the ground and defeat the trapped spirit to proceed.<br>
VO_ET_NOZDORMU_INTRO_06 - This is where she stood, heroes. And this is where she fell. The time-lost echo of Sylvanas Windrunner will reverberate through the rotting limbs of the dragonshrine for all eternity. <br>
VO_ET_NOZDORMU_INTRO_07 - You must give peace to these lands if you are to face Murozond.<br>

VO_WOE_NOZDORMU_EVENT_01 - The Dragon Soul is safe once again! Quickly.. into the time portal before this world sunders!<br>
VO_WOE_NOZDORMU_INTRO_01 - I see you&apos;ve arrived. This is the eve of the sundering.. when the collapse of the Well of Eternity fractured the continents of the world.<br>
VO_WOE_NOZDORMU_INTRO_02 - Here we will snatch up the Dragon Soul before it lost to the mists of time!<br>
VO_WOE_NOZDORMU_INTRO_03 - But first, you must bring down the protective wards of Azshara&apos;s highborn lackeys.. you will find them within the palace. I will scout on ahead.<br>
