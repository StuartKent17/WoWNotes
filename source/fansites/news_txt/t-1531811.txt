Warlords of Draenor - No Silvermoon Update
After yesterday's news that Stormwind may be repaired for Patch 6.0, Mumper also mentioned that Silvermoon is not getting an update.

Warlords of Draenor Alpha Invites
We're generally not going to provide estimates or dates for when more invites will go out as it is purely based on testing requirements, which can change from day to day. Invites will continue to roll out as needed, in very small amounts to start, and increasing as we near launch. It's worth keeping in mind that test invites overall will be limited, especially in comparison to Mists of Pandaria, where the vast majority of invites were based on the Annual Pass benefits.

Q&A
Happy Friday! I thought it'd be nice to throw answers at all of these. The focus of your WoW gaming judging by the questions at least seems to be really focused on "completionist" activities, which is awesome, but of course the majority of our efforts are going to be focused on making Warlords at the moment, and releasing the expansion, so some answers are just going to be "no plans", hopefully that makes good logical sense for where we're spending our time. Anyway, here we go.

Are there any plans to make the BoP profession patterns from BT/Hyjal/Sunwell/Ulduar/etc BoE?
No current plans.

Are there any plans to remove the class requirements for Sunwell engineering patterns?
No current plans.

Are there any plans to revisit Been Waiting a Long Time for This 25 player and 10 player to make them more doable like you did with Sinestra?
No plan to do so – it’s still quite doable with the new dispel system and a couple of players. Sinestra’s actual mechanics were changed because the fight demanded spam-dispelling in some cases.

Are there any plans to create a mount and/or pet preview window by shift clicking?
It’s a cool idea, and something we’d like to do at some point. Pretty sure there are some addons that do this right now, though.

Are there any plans to display missing mounts/pets greyed out in the mounts/pet tabs?
Yes! This is possible in Warlords, including brief instruction on where they can be found.

Are there any plans to give the Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker feat of strength for Thunderfury's created on characters that can't equip it now that achievements are account-wide?
The FoS is to be a “wielder” and does require equipping it. No plans to change that.

Are there any plans to create reputation achievements for serious reputation grinders? The possible exalted reputation count has far exceeded the associated reputation achievements for some time, making it somewhat unrewarding to receive these achievements the day they are released. Currently sitting at 75 exalted and the last achievement was for 60, which was achievable before MoP.
We’ll probably update Rep achievements again in Warlords.

Are there any plans to increase the cap on amount of battle-tag friends?
It's something our Battle.net team is working on. Due to the complexity of each separate Blizzard game on Battle.net needing to adopt the same increase, as well as other technical requirements I don’t myself understand, it's not a simple change.

Are there any plans to convert the hearthstone into a spell so it doesn't take up a bag slot? It's been doing so since 2004, I'm about to start charging it rent.
Turning items into clickable spells can be great, but it can also decrease the sense that you're actually interacting with tangible objects within the world, and instead are a person at a computer clicking on buttons. We don't want to reduce everything about existing in this virtual world to a binary button or mechanic. It’s an iconic part of the game, and it’s really just a single slot out of many slots.

Are there any plans to prune the currency tab? It is getting convoluted again.
Potentially. In the meantime there is the ability to set a currency as inactive through the UI, which helps keep some from being front and center.

Are there any plans to add Domination Point Commisions to the currency tab?
No, they're gained and spent quickly, and aren't intended to be an ongoing currency. Would recommend either spending them now or deleting what you have, they're not likely to see any more or less use in the future. If you ever want to get more in the future they’re pretty quick to farm up.

Are there any plans to handle archaeology artifacts in the same way as fragments? My bag space is precious.
This falls in line with the answer for the hearthstone question above. Hopefully we can free up a lot of that bag space for you though in Warlords.

Are there any plans to implement a search function for achievements?
It's something we want to add, but it's not currently scheduled. Wish list item at the moment. We want to make some larger Achievement UI changes, and this could be a part of that. But again, it’s not something we’re actively working on for this expansion.

Are there any plans to make older Jewelcrafting recipes Wrath/Cata more obtainable? Those dailies are painful.
Not at the moment. They're not required, and so are really only a test of will for those that want to be completionists. And that's probably ok.

Are there any plans to add Classic, Burning Crusade, and/or Wrath raids to the Dungeon Journal?
It's still on our to-do list. We continue to make some progress here and there as we go, but obviously a large majority of our effort goes toward upcoming content so it’s just finding the time to do all the nice-to-haves.

Are there any plans to allow me to have more than 25 quests?
We are making some changes to the quest log, but they don't generally include a higher limit. For most people, having a large list of tasks--usually around 15-20--can start to feel overwhelming, and for a lot of those people being overwhelmed is a deterrent to playing at all. With Cataclysm, and certainly with newer zones in Mists and Warlords, it's very rare you'll have that many quests at any one time. The quest limit is generally only an issue for those looking to go back and do older content where they vacuum an entire zone, or for those times when leveling when you're outpacing the content and should probably drop quests and move on instead of keeping a bunch of grey ones. That's a separate problem though, and not best solved by increasing the amount of XP-less grey quests you can hold on to. Anyway, no, we know some people would like to be able to store a ton of quests, but it would be a big issue for a lot of players if they ever accidentally got to that point.

Are there any plans to completely remove deprecated quests? I have an alt with a Cataclysm opening quest completed but the quest turn-in NPC is no longer available.
We do have passes that will remove quests from people's logs, but sometimes those things slip through the cracks especially with the radical Cataclsym changes as we update content. What’s the name of the quest? I can see about getting it bugged.

nothing really tangible about a Hearthstone at that point, except for the fact that it takes up that bag slot.
That's kind of as tangible as things can get for a lootable object, so we're going to hang onto it. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/318558-are-there-any-plans-to/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13075747524?page=2#27


Blue Tweets
Racials
Why didn't you implement this change after the racials have been pass through? Seems rather pointless.
Racials, like any alpha change, should not be taken as final at this point. Anything is subject to change. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/472231606292213760
sorry it you get asked a lot, but I miss my Hordies <3 they just don't feel as strong compared with that double trinket.
This is always highly debated. Many top players value the Horde Racials more in the absence of super powerful PvE trinkets. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/472256987497897984

Classes
...be designed to put tanks in jeopardy without forsaking the new methodical, efficiency based healing philosophy?
Tanks will provide less of the healing they need to survive. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472257183204126720
Meaning Resolve won't provide as much healing power as Vengeance does? Or tanks won't have the abilities to do so?
The abilities just aren't tuned as strong. Tanks in Mists could survive with no external healing too well. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472260604049121281
I hope incoming damage is still tuned high. Part of the fun of tanking is being in real danger of dying.
We 100% agree. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472277219717287936

Shred now has a 50% increased critical strike chance when used from stealth against targets over 80% health.and rogues ambush?
No, that was just adding in part of what Ravage did. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472190376866889728

Considered adding starsurge to balance of power? On low haste, you’d need to skip ss, to extend for a full cycle.
No, it should already be more than enough to maintain on a single target. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472190500645003264
You get 5 SF, 7.5 wrath in a 30s cycle, for a 30 sec ext. on both dots. Add in ss, and one of them drops off 4-6 sec to early
Nobody has 0 haste though. And there's 32sec of slack involved on Moonfire, 16sec on Sunfire. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472226279442247680

so just to confirm, starfall hits all in-combat targets every 1 sec for 10 secs?
We're going to try removing the combat check, since Guided Stars is available. But yes, all of them, every 1s for 10s. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472230173530914817
that. is. AWESOME!! It'll totally be scary when trying not to over-pull, but this is bringing it back to W3 and Wrath days.
Aye. The feeling of hitting Starfall and running around a cave, pulling *everything* is something we want to recapture. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472231980902264832

what is the purpose behind buffing HT when boomies self-cast?
That's part of a widespread reduction to downtime between pulls for many specs. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472232641123471360
so with all these changes, are you trying to make me fall in love w/ my boomie again? Cause its working 
I admit it. Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472236427728547840

DOT snapshots are gone in WoD, right? So a Moonfire cast at 1% Lunar will hit harder with successive ticks as Eclipse grows?
No... DoT snapshotting in general is gone, but Eclipse specifically is snapshotted which is why it's worded that way. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472199353130426368
Is Eclipse going to be the only exception to the no-snapshotting rule, or are you considering others, like Soulburn: Haunt?
Nah, there are specific cases throughout; most specs who had some form of important snapshotting before have ~1 thing now. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472225020219895808

is +150% mana regen bundled into moonkin/starform going to be equivalent to live's Eclipse mana boost?
It'll be enough to maintain the DPS rotation. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472242148012605440
hurricane mana cost nerf was good. but still no idea why astral storm must have 50k mana cost. why cant i spam aoe...
They have the same lower mana cost in 6.0. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472256677085839360

Perhaps I'm being a pessimist, but the new Balance mechanics seem like they'll hinder our movement in a big way in PvP.
We're gunna try making Starsurge always instant. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472310784622485504

what is intent behind 'heal on kill' buff for hunters?
We added some self-sustainability like that to several classes who were lacking in that department, lately. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472190252216365056

is a mobile stable for hunters possibly on the cards? 5 pet limit seems arbitrary and doesn't add any value.
Hmmm... that sounds like a potentially really fun hunter epic quest. Probably not for 6.0, love the idea though. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/472221604680716289

Hook wasps now wasps due to similarity. Rylaks now tamable. New pet class? If so, can't you apply same logic and add to chimeras?
It's got ground anims, and in practice doesn't look at all like a Chim, hence the new family. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/472222589893353472

Another quick question: is Focusing Shot damage supposed to be increased by the Draenor perk Improved Steady/Cobra Shot?
Yes, though you always have the relevant perk when you can get Focusing Shot, so it doesn't really matter; tuned as such. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472265679068884992

So will only 3 stack ef's proc IH?
No, all will. It just isn't worth doing 1HoPo EF blanketing for Mastery anymore. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472213477654671360

Is the duration reduction on EF poor datamining or intended?
It's a change, not a reduction. Heals for 3*X per tick for HoPo*10sec, instead of HoPo*X per tick for 30sec. Same result. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472209724666966016
Except 1HoPo EFs don't last 30sec, so we can afford to let it trigger Mastery again. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472210005580447744
Sweet!
Might be too strong, we'll see. We think it's worth a try. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472210402336456704
so 2 HoPo EF's and 3 HoPo EF's won't trigger IH? Or am I missunderstanding?
Misunderstanding. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472213318346620928
lol so vague, so all EF's will trigger IH? Even though the duration of 2HoPo and 3HoPo EF is 20/30 seconds?
It all will trigger IH. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472216214672928768
The idea is to make it a significant resource cost to keep shields refreshed for 30s rather than a trivial one, yes?
Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472226378478141440


Warlords of Draenor Alpha - Garrison Dance Hat
One of the fun things to do in your garrison that was mentioned was forming a conga line with NPCs. You can do this with the Dance Hat http://beta.wowdb.com/items/110505-dance-hat purchased from Guh http://beta.wowdb.com/npcs/80285-guh. The music in this video is not the in game music, just filler for the silence.
