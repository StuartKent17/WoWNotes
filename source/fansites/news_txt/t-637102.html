Undocumented Changes/Spell Comparison<br>
Please note that the stats of the spells here are taken directly from the game files and might be different from the officiel patch notes. This is a list of the differences between tooltips of classes spells, just don&apos;t jump to any conclusion just because a change is here and wait until it reaches the live server.<br>
<br>
Most of the changes here were revealed in the latest update of the official PTR notes. <br>
<br>
[b]General<br>
Hearthstone (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=6948) cooldown has been reduced from 60 to 30 minutes. <br>
<br>
Racial<br>
Gift of the Naaru (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=59547) now also removes 2 harmful magic effects from the friendly target. <br>
Stoneform (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=20594) no longer gives a 8 second immunity to disease, poison, and bleed effects.<br>
<br>

Blood<br>
Abomination&apos;s Might (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=53138) now also affects Death Strike.<br>
Unholy<br>
Desecration (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=55670) radius seems to have been lowered from 10 to 7 yards, due to the nature of this change (spell effect changed instead of the spell itself) I strongly suggest that you wait until the PTRs are online before taking it as confirmed<br>
