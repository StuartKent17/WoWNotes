Legion - Elerethe Renferal
Elerethe Renferal http://wow.gamepedia.com/Elerethe_Renferal is one of the bosses in the Emerald Nightmare raid. 


<iframe width="900" height="506" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K_vsV1zU5M4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Elerethe, once a mighty druid and adept shapeshifter, died believing she was betrayed by those she trusted. Her soul now resides in the nightmare, damning her to an existence of fear, confusion, and hatred.


Overview - As the fight progresses, Elerethe swaps between two nightmare forms that determine what abilities she uses. During Spider form, Elerethe uses <a href="http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/210242-web-of-pain">Web of Pain</a> on the tanks and on a random pair of dps. Damage received by your partner is reflected back to you. During Roc form, Elerethe uses <a href="http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/210948-dark-storm">Dark Storm</a> that creates a safe space on another platform then flies to it. Until the raid reaches that safe space, they take damage. If Elerethe ever walks onto the web, she gains <a href="http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/222063-web-walker">Web Walker</a> and will proceed to destroy anyone in her path. In Mythic difficulty, Elerethe activates an additional ability depending on what platform she is currently fighting on.

Worgen Running Wild
It's in the game, it's just missing from the spellbook. If you make a level 55 DK you can even see it on your action bar.

We did a lot of spellbook tweaks this expansion and this was probably just hidden by accident. Let us know if you notice any other racials missing.
