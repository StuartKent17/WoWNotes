Warlords of Draenor - Gearing Up for Heroic Dungeons
A few people have mentioned having trouble getting the item level required for heroic dungeons, so here are a few ways to grab some easy upgrades:


There are several item level 610 quest rewards from Nagrand. These can randomly upgrade to epic item level 620 items. Coif of Grasping Earth  => Coif of Grasping Earth 
Proving Grounds  bronze will reward an item level 610 weapon , which can also randomly upgrade to epic item level 630  or rare item level 620 
There are several rare spawns that drop item level 620 rare gear  Not all of it is listed yet, install the WoWDB addon and help!
PvP Honor gear is item level 620: Cloth , Leather , Mail , Plate , other armor , and weapons 
Normal dungeons offer item level 615 gear Grimrail Depot , Shadowmoon Burial Grounds , The Everbloom , Upper Blackrock Spire 
Apexis Crystal  allow you to purchase rare item level 630 gear  for 3,000 to 5,000 crystals each, which can be upgraded later for more crystals.
The legendary quest line rewards an epic item level 640 ring  from running Normal difficulty dungeons.
There are some crafted items  you can make with a Level 2 profession building. Keep in mind you can only equip three crafted items at a time.
There are a few other options, but they are likely not accessible yet or easy for most people. These include BoE world drops, Level 100 garrison missions, and more. 


Followers and Garrison Missions XP
Got an update from one of our designers that wanted provide more information on how your Followers gain XP when you send them out on Garrison Missions.

When Followers are below a mission’s level, they get a reduced percentage of the mission XP as well as any bonus XP earned.

Followers that are 1-2 levels below the mission level:

The Follower’s level number is displayed in orange, meaning they only receive 50% of the mission XP and bonus XP. 
Followers that are 3 or more levels below the mission level:
The Follower’s level number is displayed in red, meaning they only receive 10% of the mission XP and bonus XP. 
Before a hotfix that was implemented at 5:52pm PST, followers in red received 0% of the mission XP; and we felt that was not what we wanted since the UI didn’t indicate that was the case. 


Note that while level 90 missions may only award ~100XP, level 100 missions award much more, closer to the range of ~1500XP. So 10% of that is still a good amount for a level 90 Follower, even if they won't be doing a great job at getting the bonus loot until they gain some combat experience.

We’d love to continue hearing feedback on how it feels to level Followers, what missions are available, and how these new numbers feel.

Bug Fixs
Is the enchanters study suppose to not disenchant epics? Or is it bugged?
Intended CM_Lore 

Is it intended to obtain ilvl 660 tournament gear for gold? Is it an exploit people make use of?
Obtaining it, yes, as it's only usable in War Games. Using it to bypass ilevel requirements is not. CM_Lore 

just a thought: scale the 680 rings back to 640 for anyone without the quest completed
We're exploring options, too early to say at this point. Rygarius 

Doesn't seem to mention the change made to the Smuggler's Run loot table - no resource boxes any more?
We generally do not note changes designed to fix an exploit. Rygarius

When you are playing the addon will gather data and save it. When you are done playing, Curse Client will see the game close and upload the collected data from the addon. You can see the last time data was uploaded by looking in the Plugins tab of the options, as well as making sure the addon is enabled there.
