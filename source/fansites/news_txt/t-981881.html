Battleplate of Radiant Glory<br>

Design requested a set to &#x2018;key off the Guardian of Ancient Kings summon,&#x2019; and I though the concept of &#x2018;feathered&#x2019; plate mail, rendered in silver and gold, would create an aggressive, yet sweeping and powerful silhouette. The previous paladin raid set had a good deal of cloth, but we wanted this set to be entirely platemail.<br>
<br>
The key to a strong paladin tier is hitting a balance between martial prowess and elegant grace -- tapping into that classic Arthurian knight archetype.<br>
