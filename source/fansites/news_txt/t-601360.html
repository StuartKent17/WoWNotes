Due to additional development time and testing needed we will be delaying the scheduled release of the patch, and thus the start of Arena Season 2 by one week, to June 19. This current schedule is of course subject to change as well.<br>
<br>
Also, don&apos;t forget that team ratings will be reset to the default 1500 with the start of the new season, allowing all teams to once again compete for top honors with a fresh start.<br>

This could explain why we can&apos;t get Arena Season 2 sets on PTR yet ...</div></div>
