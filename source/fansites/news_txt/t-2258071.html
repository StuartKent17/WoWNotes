Greetings all,<br>
PTR realms will be coming down today in order to deploy a new 7.3.0 build. No ETA for today&apos;s push but I&apos;ll do my best to update this thread if things look like they&apos;re going to take longer than usual (~4-6 hours). <br>
<br>
As usual I&apos;ll leave this thread open for discussion so long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your patience everyone.<br>
<br>
