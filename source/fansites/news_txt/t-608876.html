WoW TCG - The Hunt for Illidan Loot Cards<br>
The Hunt for Illidan, Upper Deck&#x2019;s (UD) latest expansion of the hugely popular World of Warcraft Trading Card Game (TCG), is launching July 1st. Be among the first to play a Demon Hero or walk The Path of Illidan at a Sneak Preview event, this Saturday, June 21st! Visit WoWTCG.com (http://www.wowtcg.com) for more information and locations.<br>
<br>
Continuing the legacy of wildly popular exclusive in-game items, such as the X-51 Nether-Rocket flying mount from the sold-out Servants of the Betrayer&#x2122; expansion, The Hunt for Illidan brings amazing new Loot&#x2122; items to Azeroth! Available only through the World of Warcraft TCG, these highly sought-after cards will give lucky players the ability to walk The Path of Illidan, be the life of the party with D.I.S.C.O., or get a full-size Ethereal cosmetic pet! <br>
<br>
UD World of Warcraft TCG Loot&#x2122; Cards give players who receive them access to unique World of Warcraft MMORPG in-game items. All Loot&#x2122; Cards can only be found through the UD World of Warcraft TCG. The Hunt for Illidan Loot&#x2122; items will be available for in-game redemption after Blizzard&#x2019;s 2.4.3 patch.<br>
<br>
Walk like Illidan<br>
The super common Loot for this release is The Path of Illidan, from the card &#x201C;The Footsteps of Illidan.&#x201D; Players with this Loot item can walk or run throughout Azeroth, leaving a trail of green glowing footprints. <br>
<br>
Be the Life of the Party<br>
The uncommon Loot in The Hunt for Illidan is D.I.S.C.O., letting players start a party anywhere! Indoors or out, this Loot item comes complete with a disco ball, swirling lights and music! Any nearby players, even of a different faction, can join your party and dance. <br>
<br>
Enter the Ethereal Realm<br>
The rarest Loot in The Hunt for Illidan is the Ethereal Soul-Trader. This in-game item becomes a full-sized Ethereal cosmetic pet, who will collect souls for you and deposit Ethereal money into your bags. With this Ethereal money, you can buy any of the Ethereal Soul-Trader&#x2019;s ten unique items! Anyone can view the items, but only those lucky enough to have Ethereal money can actually buy them!<br>
