Update: Blizzard posted an official statement http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/208410/raid-finder-loot-exploit-suspensions on the LFR exploit bans.

PvP Season 11 Begins
This season brings new gear and Alizabal http://www.wowpedia.org/Alizabal, the new Baradin Hold boss. Keep in mind that all ratings will be reset http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/205701/pvp-season-10-ending-soon and higher item level honor gear http://db.mmo-champion.com/items/?level=390&name__imatches=Ruthless will be added. Any honor that you have over the 4,000 cap will be converted to gold. 

Alizabal, Mistress of Hate
The Kirin Tor imprisoned Alizabal in their formidable Violet Hold not long after corrupt magi summoned the shivarra into Azeroth. Despite arcane wards restricting her powers, the demon's malicious influence alone caused her guards to murder one another in sudden fits of rage. Her transfer to Baradin Hold prior to the Cataclysm has only aggravated the ruined prison's increasingly dire conditions.

Alizabal skewers and stuns her current target for 8 sec. Skewer also inflicts 10000 Physical damage every 2 sec. and increases the target's damage taken by 150%.

Seething Hate
Alizabal incites Seething Hate in a random player, inflicting 600000 total Fire damage to all players within 6 yards of the target. The damage is split amongst all of the nearby players.

Blade Dance
Alizabal enters a Blade Dance and inflicts 12500 Physical damage every sec. to every player within 13 yards. The Blade Dance also deflects all incoming attacks.
