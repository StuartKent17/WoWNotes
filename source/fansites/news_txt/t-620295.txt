Boubouille2008-10-22, 09:47 PMUpdate 00:35 CEST - It seems that if you /duel another player and let him kill you while you're infected, you will get instantly transformed into a zombie. 

Update 00:25 CEST - We've got the source of the infection ! You can get infected by looting the suspicious crates in Booty Bay

Update 00:00 CEST - Event is going live on ALL servers !!!!!!

Wrath of the Lich King - World Event
As I write this news, it looks like the pre-Wrath of the Lich King world event has been started on one of the US live servers, we're still unsure if it's just an error or if Blizzard is testing the event on a few servers. Below is a small preview of what to expect during this event .... You can probably expect more updates in the next hours if the event is extended to all realms.

Zombies will randomly spawn in the world and near cities and infect anyone they damage.
People infected by zombies can either get cured by other players or by Argent Healers deployed in most of the zones.
If a player or NPC isn't cured within 10 minutes ... He will turn into a zombie ! 
Players changed into zombies have access to a new set of skills http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/october/wotlkworldevent_7.jpg to let them attack and infect other players. They become friendly with other zombies and hostile to all player factions. 

Also ...
Don't waste your time finding and creating a level 1 on this server, being hostile with all player factions also means that guards will kill you on sight and pretty much instantly in the case of a level 1 character.
This is probably just the first part of the world event, it doesn't look fully deployed at all

You might want to get ready for some serious zombie invasion in the next days ....
