The Day of the Dead is a new mini world event added to the game with Wrath of the Lich King. Let's just say it's the Pirate's Day with a few more things, including a temporary companion pet : Macabre Marionette http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46831/macabre-marionette/. 

But first, you will most likely want to complete Dead Man's Party http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3456/dead-mans-party/.

Go to any graveyard, preferably the one of your faction's capital city. We'll get to that later

That's it!

Now let's get you a Macabre Marionette http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46831/macabre-marionette/. 

Buy the Recipe: Bread of the Dead http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46710/recipe-bread-of-the-dead/ from Chapman next to Catrina and learn it.
Buy the Simple Flour http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/30817/simple-flour/ from any cooking supplies NPC just take the one next to the trainer if you don't know where they are and Ice Cold Milk http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/1179/ice-cold-milk/ from most Innkeeper and Food/Drink vendors. 
Go to the graveyard of your faction's capital city and go to the Ghostly Cooking Fire http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/october/dayofthedead_7.jpg next to Catrina.
Create a Bread of the Dead http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46691/bread-of-the-dead/.

One of the ghosts will offer the following quest : The Grateful Dead http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14166/the-grateful-dead/.
Give the bread to the ghost to receive your Macabre Marionette http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46831/macabre-marionette/!

And you're done with the Day of the Dead. Below is the description from the official page http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/events/dayofthedead/index.html.
During the Day of the Dead, the people of Azeroth gather in graveyards to celebrate and cherish the spirits of those they have lost. One can find the festivities in the cemeteries of any major city where celebrants cook, drink, don costumes and more.

Can you feel it? The spirit world draws close during the Day of the Dead. This is why we decorate the graves of our dearly departed with flowers and candles and offerings: to welcome them back, even if only for a time. 

Features
Type: Memorial Holiday
Date: November 1-2
Locations: Graveyards of all Major Cities: Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, Exodar, Orgrimmar, Undercity, Silvermoon City, Thunderbluff, Shattrath City, and Dalaran City

Dance with Catrina
Come dance with her. Let us cherish and honor those we have lost in their ghostly presence, so that they might eat and drink and smile and know that they are loved. Walk up to Catrina, select her, and type /dance. You will receive an achievement and a 12 hour buff: Honor the Dead, which will change your appearance to that of Catrina or Chapman. 

The Grateful Dead
Purchase some Orange Marigold or Bouquet of Orange Marigolds from Chapman and use them to see the otherwise invisible spirit in the graveyard.

It's good to visit with friends and family again, though I may have overdone it... I've already eaten everything they made for me, says the Cheerful Human Spirit. Might I trouble you for some of that delicious Bread of the Dead? I'd be most grateful. Chapman there sells the recipe, I think.

Acquire some Bread of the Dead and give it to the Cheerful Spirit.

Your reward is a Macabre Marionette, a small pet that looks like a skeleton wearing a sombrero and holding a pair of maracas. This pet can only be used during the Day of the Dead event - it cannot be learned and kept like other small pets.
