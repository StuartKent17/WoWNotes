Blizzard Adding Facebook Login and Facebook Live Streaming<br>
Blizzard Entertainment and Facebook are working together to provide gamers around the world with new ways to connect and share their gaming experiences, while bringing more high-demand entertainment content to Facebook&#x2019;s global platform.<br>
<br>
The companies announced today that a major step in their ongoing collaboration will begin later this month with the integration of Facebook Login in Blizzard&#x2019;s PC games. This will enable players to sign up for and log in to games such as World of Warcraft&#xAE;, Heroes of the Storm&#xAE;, Hearthstone&#xAE;, Diablo&#xAE; III, StarCraft&#xAE; II, and Blizzard&#x2019;s most recent blockbuster release, Overwatch&#xAE;, using their Facebook accounts.<br>
<br>
Adding Facebook Login will pave the way for new social functionality in Blizzard games while highlighting Facebook&#x2019;s capabilities as a platform for sharing, viewing, and discussing AAA game content. As an example, Blizzard is in the process of incorporating Facebook&#x2019;s Live API in order to create its own &#x201C;Go Live&#x201D; streaming functionality for its games. When this functionality is implemented, players will for the first time be able to livestream their Blizzard-gaming sessions directly to their Facebook timelines, and friends will be able to subscribe and be notified when new streams are available.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Blizzard games are best when played with friends, so it&#x2019;s important to us to provide our players with features and services that make it easy and fun to share their experiences with each other,&#x201D; said Gio Hunt, executive vice president of corporate operations at Blizzard Entertainment. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re working closely with Facebook on this integration for Overwatch, as well as our other games, and we look forward to sharing further details on our plans as development progresses.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As part of the collaboration between the two companies, Blizzard recently hosted multiple livestreams via Facebook. The first series of streams centered on Heroes of the Dorm&#x2122;, Blizzard&#x2019;s collegiate tournament featuring its popular team-brawler Heroes of the Storm. Last week, Blizzard hosted a livestreamed launch event for Overwatch on Facebook.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Blizzard has a passionate community of players, and an incredible track record for launching innovative and high-quality gaming experiences,&#x201D; said Leo Olebe, global games partnerships director at Facebook. &#x201C;Our collaboration on Overwatch demonstrates Facebook&#x2019;s commitment to partnering with AAA game companies, while further empowering Blizzard gamers to connect and share the content they&apos;re most passionate about with the friends they play with around the world.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
In preparation for the Overwatch launch, Facebook worked with Blizzard on a comprehensive mix of Facebook and Instagram marketing solutions&#x2014;including Carousel ads, Canvas, and Instagram Marquee. Using the platforms&#x2019; powerful targeting capabilities, Facebook helped Blizzard present the game to a broad set of gaming and entertainment audiences within Facebook&#x2019;s and Instagram&apos;s global audiences of 1.65 billion and 400 million people respectively. On Facebook, more than 650 million people play games connected to Facebook every month across web, mobile, and console.</div></div>
