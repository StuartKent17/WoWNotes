100,000 More Beta-Test Invites - Wave 2<br>
Yesterday&#x2019;s 100,000 Annual Pass-holder beta-test invites ran through the night, and we&#x2019;re still in the process of notifying the invitees by email. Those selected for yesterday&#x2019;s wave of invites should all have the Mists of Pandaria beta client available for download through Battle.net account management, and they should all receive the email notification by end of day today. If the beta client shows up for you in Battle.net account management, you don&#x2019;t need to wait for the email in order to download the client and begin testing.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re off to a solid start with the beta test, and things are looking good in terms of realm stability, so we&#x2019;re ready to invite another wave of Annual Pass holders. A second wave of invites is going out to 100,000 more Annual Pass holders today, starting right now.<br>
<br>
If you&#x2019;re added in this or any subsequent wave, access to the beta client will show up in Battle.net account management as discussed above. Please check there today and tomorrow, as today&#x2019;s wave of invites will be processing throughout the day and likely into early tomorrow morning. Notification emails will also be going out, but again, no need to wait for the email if the beta client is available to you through Battle.net account management.</div></div>
