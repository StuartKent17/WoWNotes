Cataclysm Post Mortem -- Quest Design with Dave &quot;Fargo&quot; Kosak<br>
To kick-off our World of Warcraft: Cataclysm post mortem series, we sat down with World of Warcraft Lead Quest Designer Dave &#x201C;Fargo&#x201D; Kosak to discuss his thoughts on questing in Cataclysm.<br>
<br>
Q: What were your main goals going into Cataclysm?<br>
Certainly from a quest design standpoint our primary goal with Cataclysm was to remake the old world, specifically the 1-60 questing experience. World of Warcraft was released in 2004, and we&apos;ve learned so much in the years since about what constitutes good MMO gameplay. We wanted to make sure that the game was relevant to new players coming in, and walking up and down the length of the Barrens on foot over and over just didn&#x2019;t do it for us anymore.<br>
<br>
Remaking the entire old world -- 46 zones! -- was ambitious. Actually, it was ludicrous. It was like re-releasing a whole game in the course of an expansion cycle. Then we added a couple new races and their starting zones on top of that. I&#x2019;m not sure how we convinced ourselves we could make it happen, but somehow we pulled it together.<br>
<br>
Q: Are you happy with how the old world re-vamp turned out?<br>
I am. Leveling up a new character to 60 nowadays is a great deal of fun. Every zone has stories to play out, with interesting nooks and crannies and plenty of hidden gems or references for players who remember the pre-Cataclysm world. Zones like Ashenvale now live up to their premise (intense Horde-vs.-Alliance combat), and previously empty zones now have a lot of character (see: Azshara). The content just flows. It&apos;s still World of Warcraft, but the quests have a modern feel, with lots of action and storytelling.<br>
<br>

<br>
Q: But what didn&apos;t work out so well?<br>
We really spread ourselves thin and taxed the team. The original plan was to totally re-do a handful of high-priority zones, but to leave a lot of the zones that worked mostly alone. We categorized them into &quot;red,&quot; &quot;yellow,&quot; and &quot;green&quot; zones. The idea behind the green zones (for example, Loch Modan) was just to tweak the quest flow to be a little smoother, but not to make any major changes.<br>
<br>
The reality is that even the green zones really needed a lot of love. Once we got in there, it was all or nothing: we ended up completely re-doing a lot of green zones so that they met our new quest design standards. We came up with a nickname: &quot;watermelon&quot; zones. They were green on the outside, until you got in there and started poking around. . . .<br>
<br>
Where that hurt us was when it came time to do the max-level content, the 80-85 zones. The content there turned out well, but the experience is inconsistent across the board -- Uldum feels totally different from Hyjal, which in turn feels different from Vashj&apos;ir. The design decisions and efforts we made didn&apos;t always yield the desired results.<br>
<br>
Q: Tell us more about the level 80-85 zones -- what worked and didn&#x2019;t?<br>
We were aiming for a really global feel with Cataclysm, so we set the max-level zones in varied environments all over the world (underwater, across deserts, in the elemental plane of earth, etc). However, as a result, they ended up not feeling as connected as we&apos;d like. You get widely different experiences in zones that aren&#x2019;t geographically related to one another. That&apos;s something important that we&apos;re keeping in mind moving forward &#x2013; World of Warcraft works best when there&apos;s a sense of place. A connected world to explore.<br>
<br>
We feel the storytelling in Cataclysm was strong. Whether assembling the ancients in Hyjal, rescuing your drowned crew in Vashj&apos;ir, or reassembling the world pillar in Deepholm, there&#x2019;s a strong sense of plot in every zone. Players participated in stirring stories, like bringing the Dragonmaw into the Horde via a violent coup or reuniting the Wildhammer Dwarves with a crazy wedding. These were memorable moments and shared experiences.<br>
<br>
The downside to creating these stories is that the zones on the whole ended up being way too linear. For example, because we wanted to show your character re-growing the burning devastation of Mount Hyjal, there was really only one way to play that zone: you started at point A, and you worked your way through to point Z. Pretty glorious the first time, but frustrating on your second or third character because there&apos;s only one way to do it, and no way to skip around. That&apos;s a lesson we&#x2019;re going to carry forward for sure. We want big sweeping stories, but we want to give players the freedom to explore those stories on their own terms.<br>
<br>
Q: Places like Hyjal also used a lot of phasing to show the world changing.<br>
We have a massive phase shift halfway through the story that changes the terrain for nearly a third of the zone. It&apos;s epic, right? But it can be a real pain for players when so much of the world changes like that. Phasing is like a story sledgehammer: it gets the job done, but at best it splits up players and at worst it totally confuses them.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re going to be a lot more careful going forward. The Firelands dailies in patch 4.2 gives you a much better idea of our future direction. There were sweeping visual changes to the world as you progressed, but there&#x2019;s very little actual phasing. For the most part, everyone is playing together on the same map. That&#x2019;s important to us. Looking ahead, we&#x2019;re going to be a lot smarter about how we show changes to the world, and we&#x2019;re going to do everything we can to avoid splitting players up.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Q: Talk more about the 4.2 patch. Were the Firelands dailies a hint of what&#x2019;s to come?<br>
Definitely. With those dailies we were able to engage a lot of players, myself included. (I was the first quest designer on the team to get the mount and all the achievements on the live servers -- suck it up, slackers!) Previously, &quot;doing dailies&quot; meant hitting the same quest givers for the same three quests, usually in a static place. Here we were able to deliver a sense of progression and a story that unfurled over the course of a few weeks, all as you did a constantly changing set of quest objectives in a dynamic environment. We think that worked out well.<br>
<br>
Moving forward, we&apos;re going to look for more opportunities like this -- ways to keep people engaged and cool things to do solo with your max-level character. We&apos;ve got ambitious plans.<br>
<br>
Q: Patch 4.2 also had the Aggra and Thrall questline, &quot;Elemental Bonds.&quot; Did that meet your expectations? How do you feel about Thrall&apos;s character development?<br>
That&apos;s a tricky one -- we&#x2019;ve got mixed feelings. The essential story is a good one, and we really wanted to portray all the inner struggles Thrall is going through. Here&#x2019;s a guy that stepped down as Warchief and had to rediscover himself as a shaman in order to save the world. And he&apos;s haunted by his decisions: he&#x2019;s afraid of what&#x2019;s to come, paralyzed by doubt, angry at what Garrosh did to Cairne . . . the guy&apos;s a mess. We figured out a way to show all that internal tension, and we wrapped it up in a story that demonstrates how his mate, Aggra, will literally go to the ends of the world to pull him through this. It&apos;s a powerful love story, and a story about finding one&#x2019;s inner focus.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/HsXglDs81FU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br>
<br>
But we had to do a lot of things to make it work in the game. We needed to make a quest that 500 people could do simultaneously without getting in each other&apos;s way. We wanted a quest that players could do solo, no matter what their skill level. We didn&#x2019;t know if the player was decked out in raid gear or level 85 greens, so we had to keep it simple. We somehow made all of it work under those restrictions, and we filled the screen with some killer imagery (I love the vision of Thrall immersed in the Abyssal Maw). But ultimately the quests themselves ended up not being as compelling from a gameplay perspective as we would have liked. Many players blew through them once and never looked back.<br>
<br>
I really think we can do better. Cataclysm was in many ways Thrall&#x2019;s story, but it was hard for players to follow his development over the course of the expansion. Going forward we want to convey a clearer narrative, delivered in the context of solid gameplay. We have some ideas on how to do that, and we&#x2019;re also going to keep experimenting. This is important to us -- we talk about ways to tackle this problem all the time.<br>
<br>
Q: The Cataclysm patches also saw the debut of some legendary weapons: Dragonwrath and the Fangs of the Father. Will future legendaries be this, uh, legendary?<br>
Good question. We love class-specific content, but quest lines like those are very resource-intensive. Each sequence involves weeks of development focus that takes content away from dungeons, dailies, or outdoor zones.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/AXgV-V023-M?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br>
<br>
The feedback from players (and from our own team) has been overwhelmingly positive. Dragonwrath proved to be extremely popular, and allowed caster classes to get a front-row seat for major lore moments otherwise reserved only for dragons. Meanwhile, Fangs of the Father was pure rogue, from the theme to the mechanics. It was super-targeted and extremely fun -- it proved to us the value of focusing in on a specific class and tailoring the content to their abilities. Given that the audience for these weapons consists of badass raiders, we didn&#x2019;t hold back on the difficulty either, so these quests were great for people who wanted a real challenge.<br>
<br>
The short answer is yes, we&apos;ll definitely continue doing these moving forward. Most likely future legendary quest lines will be built similar to the rogue experience: a couple key story moments, a lot of flavor, and some very specific challenges. But I wouldn&apos;t expect very many quest lines like these. Like legendary weapons themselves, they&apos;re going to be rare and special.<br>
<br>
Q: We haven&apos;t even talked about goblins and worgen yet. What lessons did you take away from the new racial starting zones?<br>
In both cases, the starting areas really sold the character and tone of the new races. The worgen area is so marvelously gothic, and Kezan is unmistakably unique and gobliny. The art and the quests all work together to establish a racial character. So that&#x2019;s a big win.<br>
<br>
As for the mechanics themselves, I&#x2019;m glad we were so experimental, but our general feeling now that all is said and done is that we went a little too &#x2018;gimmicky&#x2019; with the player&#x2019;s initial experiences. Everyone can agree that the goblin experience gets pretty wild in places.<br>
<br>
That&apos;s a big lesson we&apos;re carrying away from the expansion as a whole.<br>
<br>
Q: Can you elaborate?<br>
Overwhelmingly, players have told us that they want more quests where you have to flap a giant bird around a cave while targeting creatures in a 3D space.<br>
<br>
Q: Seriously?<br>
Maybe not . . . But moving forward, we&apos;re re-focusing on core gameplay mechanics. World of Warcraft works best when you&#x2019;ve got your boots on the ground and you get to play your class. To that end, we&#x2019;re concentrating on giving players lots of fun combat challenges in continually changing environments, wrapped up in a terrific story that&#x2019;s propelled forward by the quests. Whenever we do special mechanics, we want them to feel special, and they&#x2019;ll never tear you away from combat for very long. Our goal is to load up the world with lots of interactive spaces, cool encounters, great characters, and neat spaces to explore. That&#x2019;s part of the reason we&#x2019;re keeping you grounded (literally) in Pandaria, and why we&#x2019;re focusing on a single continent. But I&#x2019;m getting ahead of myself. We&#x2019;ll talk more about Pandaria soon enough.<br>
<br>
Q: Looking forward to it. Thanks for your time!<br>
Not a problem!</div></div>
