It looks like you won&apos;t need the cloak for Ordos (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/511942709092052993) anymore either!<br>
As your journey takes you from Pandaria to Draenor, we wanted to extend one last opportunity to obtain your Legendary Cloak&#x2014;and share some important updates related to this iconic item. <br>
<br>
Legendary Cloak Changes: Once More unto the Breach<br>
As a part of the transition from Mists of Pandaria to Warlords of Draenor, we&#x2019;ll be making some changes to the Legendary Cloak quest line and ultimately closing it out as players head into the new expansion. Once the quest is fully closed, the item will no longer be attainable, and the cloak will become a symbol of the great deeds you&#x2019;ve accomplished in Mists of Pandaria.<br>
<br>
With the release of the pre-expansion patch (6.0.2), players who are not already on the journey through this quest line will no longer be able to begin it. We will also be removing the Test of Valor step with patch 6.0.2 as a part of our transition from using Valor as a currency.<br>
<br>
Once Warlords of Draenor launches on November 13, the Legendary Cloak quest line will be gone entirely&#x2014;the quests and the cloak will no longer be obtainable, and any related in-progress quests will be cleared from your log.<br>
<br>
But when one door closes, another door opens. In Warlords of Draenor, players will have the opportunity to earn a new Legendary item available exclusively in the new expansion: Khadgar&#x2019;s Band of the Archmage (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/armor/rings?filter-search=spellbound).<br>
<br>
The Gaze of the Black Prince: One Last Look<br>
If you haven&#x2019;t yet earned your Legendary Cloak, you still have one final opportunity to make accelerated progress on your quest. Rather than end the Gaze of the Black Prince buff on Tuesday, September 16 (as previously announced), the buff will remain active until the release of the Warlords of Draenor pre-patch (6.0.2). This buff increases the reputation gained with the Black Prince by 100%. It also increases the chance of obtaining items from his foes needed as a part of the Legendary Cloak quest line, including Secrets of the Empire, Sigil of Wisdom, Sigil of Power, and Titan Runestones.<br>
<br>
Good luck on your quest, but remember that your voyage doesn&#x2019;t end here. Soon, you&#x2019;ll be setting your sights on the new Legendary item, Khadgar&#x2019;s Band of the Archmage, in Warlords of Draenor.<br>
<br>
<br>
Heirloom Vendor Change in Patch 6.0.2<br>
Heirlooms in the Warlords of Draenor beta currently have some gold prices (http://beta.wowdb.com/npcs/52037-zulna#related:sells;_!) associated with them, but the prices may not be final. You will still be able to get the shields and offhands from the Darkmoon Faire (https://twitter.com/nite_moogle/status/511930566610939904). <br>
With the upcoming release of Patch 6.0.2, we&#x2019;ll be sending the vendors who sell Heirlooms for Justice Points on a nice vacation.<br>
<br>
As you might already be aware, both Justice and Valor Points are being removed as currencies from the game in 6.0.2. As we started to work on new ways to buy Heirlooms, we found that we were setting their value up for a rollercoaster ride. That&apos;s because we&#x2019;re also working on a larger Heirloom system for a future patch, and we don&#x2019;t want to introduce an interim pricing scheme that could temporarily devalue Heirlooms or limit how we&#x2019;d be able to give them out in the future. Rather than make players face buyer&#x2019;s remorse and hand-wringing decisions about when to buy, we&#x2019;re going to give the Justice Heirloom vendors some time off while we work on improving the system as a whole.<br>
<br>
One thing to note is that this change only affects vendors that sell Heirlooms for Justice. PvE Heirlooms will still remain available at the Darkmoon Faire and the Trial of the Crusader, and PvP Heirlooms will continue to be available for Honor.</div></div>
