Elemental Casting Animation Updates
Thank you for providing early feedback on visual updates.

We are still in the early stages of PTR - there is a lot of work ahead to get this round of casters feeling the best they can. Providing specific details about what is missing the mark and why, as well as what is working well and feels great will help us guide the coming weeks of development.

There are many spell effects, animations, and sounds still being worked on, and will be continually introduced throughout PTR. Thank you for your thoughts, we are listening.

What about Warlock casting animations?
Our project to improve combat visuals is ongoing. Warlocks and other specs are being worked on, but were not ready for this patch.

I miss when my race determined my animations.
7.3 has a suite of new casting animations similar to our melee update at launch. Each race will retain their unique animations for many spells, while other spells will use new ones. Presently the core nuke spell for each spec fireball, lightning bolt, smite, etc. use race-specific animations, while less frequent highlight moments use class-specific animations, plus a few one-handed casts mixed in for differentiation, readability, and style. 

We agree that custom race animations are critical to keep, but also that iconic spells like Lava Burst or Pyroblast deserve a defining, class-specific treatment. Blue Tracker [/b] ] Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20757226462?page=1#15

Resto Shaman - Animation Update Feedback
The new Chain Heal animation is actually using the wrong texture on the PTR - in a future build it will have a more thematically-appropriate "watery" color, as intended similar to the particle effects you can see as it dissipates.

NamePlates
Quick update here now that the 7.3 PTR is up.

We're adding a couple of new options in 7.3 that can be accessed through these commands. These have been added based on feedback we've seen from the community and should assist in changing friendly nameplates where desired.

Let us know if you have any questions or feedback!
