Paid BattleTag Changes Now Available<br>
Looking to change up how you identify yourself in the Blizzard online community? The BattleTag&#xAE; you originally chose doesn&#x2019;t have to be your nickname for all eternity&#x2014;sometimes you want to switch to something more suited to the hero (or villain) you&#x2019;ve become since you first arrived in the Blizzard universe.<br>
<br>
While we&#x2019;ve always provided players with one free BattleTag change per account, now we&#x2019;re pleased to offer an additional paid BattleTag change service (https://eu.battle.net/shop/en/product/battle-tag-name-change) for those of you who would appreciate the opportunity to choose yet another new moniker.<br>
<br>
Free First Change<br>
If you&#x2019;re ready for something new and haven&#x2019;t already used your free BattleTag change, simply visit your Account Management Dashboard (https://eu.battle.net/login/en/?ref=https://eu.battle.net/account/management/&amp;app=bam&amp;cr=true), and click the Change link under your Account Details to the right of your current tag.<br>
<br>
If you haven&#x2019;t used your free change yet, don&#x2019;t worry&#x2014;BattleTag changes don&#x2019;t expire and yours will be waiting for you if and when you ever decide to use it.<br>
<br>
If you&#x2019;ve already used your first free change and still feel like a new nickname would be a better fit, the option to purchase an additional change will be available within Account Management. Changes are available for 10 &#x20AC; each, and your new moniker will be reflected on your friends list automatically after making the change.<br>
<br>
For more details on the feature, check out our support article (https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/400005) or visit the Shop page (https://eu.battle.net/shop/en/product/battle-tag-name-change).<br>
<br>
Paid BattleTag Change FAQ<br>
If I want to change my BattleTag, does it have to be something unique?<br>
BattleTags do not need to be unique. You can use any name you want, as long as it follows our Naming Policy. Each BattleTag is assigned a numeric ID to create a unique identifier (for example, FallenSlayer#3592).<br>
<br>
Will changing my BattleTag affect my friends list?<br>
Your friends will now automatically see you listed under your new BattleTag, but otherwise your friends list will not be affected by this change.<br>
<br>
Will new accounts still get a free name change upon creation?<br>
Yes. All new Battle.net accounts will continue to receive one free BattleTag change upon creation.<br>

Patch 7.1 PTR Dungeon/Raid Testing Plans<br>
This is an unusual PTR, in that we don&apos;t typically have fresh dungeon and raid content to test when a new expansion has just launched, but then again, Legion isn&apos;t exactly the typical expansion.<br>
<br>
For testing purposes, we&apos;ll be treating Karazhan like a Normal-mode raid, since that&apos;s what it resembles in most ways except raid size. That means it&apos;ll be closed for the majority of the PTR cycle, but we&apos;ll open it up at least a couple of times for a couple of days (without any attunement required, though one will be on live - for testing you&apos;ll be able to just zone in) at a time for open-ended testing and feedback.<br>
<br>
We also have Trial of Valor to test, as well as a few Nighthold bosses we&apos;ll want to revisit for numerical tuning. We realize that most raiding guilds are going to have their hands quite full starting next week, but we&apos;re going to try to sneak in one raid testing day on Monday (probably around 1pm PDT, 10pm CEDT). We&apos;ll update with exact testing details within a day or so, assuming server stability holds up. <br>
<br>
I sincerely apologize on behalf of the team for all this content, and thank you in advance for any time you take away from the live servers in order to help us test it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Raid Testing Schedule - September 19<br>
On Monday, September 19, we will be conducting a focused raid test of two Trial of Valor Heroic bosses, and one Mythic Nighthold boss.<br>
<br>
Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Mythic, of course, requires a fixed 20-player group.<br>
<br>
Monday, September 19<br>
<br>
Odyn - Heroic Trial of Valor<br>
13:00 PDT (16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST)<br>
<br>
Guarm - Heroic Trial of Valor<br>
14:00 PDT (17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST)<br>
<br>
Spellblade Aluriel - Mythic Nighthold<br>
15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 00:00 CEST)<br>
<br>
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br>

Legendary Item Drop Rate Bug<br>
We&#x2019;ve identified and hotfixed an issue that could cause Legion legendary items to drop more frequently than intended, if a player had already received their first legendary. <br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who reported this - the ability to look at specific cases where this was and wasn&#x2019;t happening was invaluable for isolating what exactly was causing this bug to occur.<br>
<br>
<br>
Patch 7.0.3 Hotfixes - September 15<br>

<br>
Rampage weapon trails now show for every swing of rampage regardless of whether the weapon was sheathed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Class Halls<br>
<br>
Druids who abandoned either &quot;Essence of Balance&quot; or &quot;Essence of Regrowth&quot; should now be able to reaccept the quests by returning to the Emerald Dreamway.<br>
Druids should now receive Naralex or Zen&apos;tabra after entering their order halls.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeons<br>
<br>
Players are now able to summon other players into Mythic dungeons as long as the player being summoned meets the requirements of the dungeon.<br>

<br>
Restless Tides now cast Imprisoning Bubble and Undertow correctly when more than one player is in melee with them.<br>

<br>

Enchanting<br>
<br>
Fixed an issue where some epic quality items awarded from world quests provided incorrect disenchant materials.<br>
Enchant Cloak &#x2013; Gift of Critical Strike, Enchant Cloak &#x2013; Gift of Haste, Enchant Cloak &#x2013; Gift of Mastery, and Enchant Cloak &#x2013; Gift of Versatility now increase the player&#x2019;s movement speed by 2% (was 10%).<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; Notes: In fights where movement speed is important, Draenor cloak enchants (which reward run speed) were outperforming the best Legion cloak enchants (which do not). To protect enchanters from having to farm Draenor materials, we&apos;ve reduced the run speed bonus on Draenor cloak enchants to 2%. We feel that cloak enchants aren&#x2019;t the ideal place for run speed enhancements, and we will continue to look at interesting run speed options as the expansion continues.<br>
<br>
<br>

On &#x201C;Shrine of the Truthguard&#x201D;, players who navigate to Dalaran by using their Dalaran Hearthstone, regular Hearthstone, or by getting ported, will receive the &#x201C;Return to Dalaran&#x201D; objective and become able to turn in the quest to Lord Maxwell Tyrosus.<br>

Shadowform has returned as a new spell for Shadow Priests:<br>

You may not cast any Holy spells while in this form.<br>
The shadowy visual is now tied to Shadowform.<br>

Developer Interview - Luis Barriga<br>
MMOGames (http://www.mmogames.com/gamearticles/interview-world-warcraft-legion-lead-game-designer/) had the opportunity to talk to Luis Barriga about Legion and Patch 7.1. Most of it is already well known, but there were a few important points:<br>
<br>
One of the issues that we see is there&#x2019;s a lot of friction in getting things setup. What we&#x2019;ve seen in games like Diablo and Heroes of the Storm are systems where they just notify you that &#x2018;Hey Eric just joined a queue&#x2019; and I click and request to join. Already we&#x2019;re thinking about stuff to add to our content patches.<br>
We finished Legion and then we didn&#x2019;t stop. Okay, here&#x2019;s the next patch. It&#x2019;s going to be ready for testing soon. I can&#x2019;t recall a time when we&#x2019;ve been so aggressive when we&#x2019;ve had plans for this patch and the next patch already.<br>
The main thing that we want to drive is that we want our fans to know we mean it when we say we have a lot of content planned for you guys. We&#x2019;re well aware that it was an issue towards the end of Warlords and we want to reassure our fans that we have a content train that&#x2019;s not going to stop.</div></div>
