Legion PvP Stat Templates in World PvP<br>
Stat templates only work in instanced PvP like battlegrounds and arenas. Out in the world your stats come from your gear. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/406146-legion-world-pvp-scaling/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742845325?page=1#4))<br>

Vanilla PVP set and Transmog<br>
Thanks for the info. 1 Small addition. Hunter Alliance transmog on my shaman. Its mail, but i cant transmog to it because its limited to hunter class. Will the Hunter transmog be avalable for me as well? Let me live the dream of the Golden Shaman<br>
As it stands, this won&apos;t be possible as a Shaman can&apos;t equip gear with the Hunter class restriction. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/405975-vanilla-pvp-set-and-transmogs/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17610902111?page=1#8))<br>

Won&apos;t changing Tank self heals/shields to AP scaling bring back the problems that Vengeance/Resolve were meant to fix?<br>
Those are solved other ways. This change doesn&apos;t affect that anyway. Was HP-based, now AP-based. Neither vary by inc dmg. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/710596309791727616))<br>
<br>
.Sorry, Could you please switch the BrM and Guardian crit passive?<br>
Brewmaster already has a stat that gives avoidance. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/710603376493367296))<br>

can you tell me if current lunar strike animation is a placeholder? (since it&apos;s the same animation of stellar flare)<br>
Not placeholder; those are different visuals. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/710600614422683649))<br>

if a monk talents into mistwalk, is it intended to replace transcendence?<br>
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/710599020578742272))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Will there be a dmg/health bonus for MoP soloing similar to Cata/wrath etc? Just curious if that&apos;s in the works.<br>
The existing bonuses are because Wrath/Cata items were squished; MoP items weren&apos;t. If we did another squish, we&apos;d add a MoP bonus. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/710508734137503744))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
Ya know, Sporebats are one of my favorite creatures we&apos;ve ever made. Super interesting, thematic, animations are iconic, and great cuddlers. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/710523088606253056))<br>

Warcraft III and Diablo II Patches<br>
Both games got updates to improve modern system compatibility.<br>
Warcraft III has received a modern-day update!<br>

Patch 1.27a is aimed at enabling this legacy title to run smoothly on contemporary operating systems, and the client now has improved compatibility with Windows 7 and above and Mac OS X. Take a look at the Warcraft III forum post (http://us.battle.net/en/forum/topic/20742874519) for more information on the patch, and head over to the Battle.net Shop (https://eu.battle.net/shop/en/product/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos) to grab your digital copy of the game.<br>
<br>
We also released a similar patch for Diablo II. You can find more details on patch 1.14a on the Diablo II forum (http://us.battle.net/en/forum/topic/20742864181), and get your copy here (https://eu.battle.net/shop/en/product/diablo-ii).<br>
<br>
Further updates are planned for both Diablo II and Warcraft III in the future, as we keep working behind the scenes to make sure you continue to have a great gaming experience. Details will be available as development progresses. Thank you for continuing to play these classic games!</div></div>
