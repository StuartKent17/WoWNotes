<br>
Get ready for first contact with the Iron Horde&#x2014;oh, and you&#x2019;ll probably want to prepare yourself for battle. Over the next few weeks, we&#x2019;ll be testing a pre-expansion patch that will bring players to the brink of great peril, as the Iron Horde begins to aggressively gain a foothold on Azeroth.<br>
<br>
As part of this patch, players will encounter fierce new opponents and get their first chance to experience a number of updates we&#x2019;re making to the game. In addition to changes to the skills and abilities for every class, this patch will introduce brand new features such as 20-player Mythic-difficulty Siege of Orgrimmar, as well as systems adjustments including stat squish and diminishing returns on crowd control. The next chapter in the World of Warcraft saga is coming at you armed to the teeth.<br>
<br>
Treacherous Developments<br>
The Dark Portal in the Blasted Lands has turned blood red. Hundreds of strange-looking orcs are violently pouring into Azeroth, killing everything that stands in their path. Nethergarde and Okril&#x2019;lon have already fallen, and while the Horde and the Alliance moved as quickly as they could to get reinforcements to their people, they are too late. The Iron Horde invasion has begun. <br>
<br>
In this desperate hour, King Wrynn and Warchief Vol&#x2019;jin have called upon their greatest champions to join the front lines in the Blasted Lands and do whatever they can to stop the Iron Horde . . . before the rest of Azeroth falls before them.<br>
<br>
Word of this surprise attack sends players rushing to the Blasted Lands to reckon with the barbarous infiltration. After the fall of a high ranking Iron Horde general named Gar&#x2019;mak Bladetwist, you&#x2019;ll report what you&#x2019;ve witnessed in the Blasted Lands to King Wrynn or Warchief Vol&#x2019;jin. It&#x2019;s apparent to both the Horde and the Alliance that this is only the first salvo in a much larger conflict, and the only way to win is to take the fight directly to the Iron Horde . . . by journeying through the Dark Portal into Draenor.<br>
<br>
The Infiltration of Blackrock Spire<br>
An advance party of Iron Horde forces has barged right out of the Blasted Lands and pushed all the way to Blackrock Mountain, where they found refuge and supplies in Upper Blackrock Spire. There can be only one response: the Alliance and the Horde of Azeroth must face this iron incursion head on.<br>
<br>
Available to level-90 characters for a limited time, this specially revamped five-player version of Upper Blackrock Spire sets the stage for the coming counterstrike against the Iron Horde. Here, you will face Orebender Gor&apos;ashan, Kyrak, and Commander Tharbek as you begin to take the fight to the enemy and sharpen the skills (and swords) you&#x2019;ll need to succeed on an unwelcoming alien world.<br>
<br>
Draenor is waiting.</div></div>
