It's me or Crackling Jade Lightning in Stance of the Wise Serpent with Jade Serpent Statue don't proc Eminence Statue ? Is it intentional?
Yes, Eminence only works for the Monk in Crane Stance. Xuen still causes Eminence regardless of the Monk's stance

1. For stat calculating purposes, how does the Night Elf racial Touch of Elune determine whether its currently night or day? 
Server time.

Possible to get current proc rates/data on the various new weapon enchants?
They're extremely untuned still. Once we get them at least ballpark tuned, I'll provide that data. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Classes
Any chance Combo Points can update a bit faster than they currently do? 
Yes! Celestalon 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
still looking for Hunter changes. 3 BA's on premade 100 and only 1 single proc of LnL.
Of course, because you're not Multistrike geared yet. Celestalon 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Have BrM monks received all the ability pruning they are gonna get...they still seem to have a lot of buttons&redundant skills?
No more major changes planned there, no. Celestalon 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Healing beta. Priest. Should I start treating flash heal as greater heal, not flash heal? In usage amounts, comparing early Cata
Kind of. It's similar in that it's your high-throughput heal. Celestalon 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Can multistrike proc Lightning Strike & Eruption too? 1 Lava Beam w/ 2 multistrikes gen 15 charges = 5 eruptions from 1 cast?
Nope. Celestalon 
Shame, could've looked pretty awesome to see a few go off at the same time 
Oh you definitely can see a couple go off at the same time, just on different targets. Celestalon 
That's great, it looks very aesthetically pleasing. Was secretly hoping to see it rather frequently 
Get a bunch of Mastery and spam Chain Lightning; it'll be frequent. Celestalon 

Now that Elemental has no overload will our spell damage be increased to compensate?
Elemental did not lose Overload; it got merged with Multistrike. Celestalon 
But everybody has Multistrike will all classes be balanced around the possibility to "overload"?
Elemental's Multistrikes are different; much stronger. Celestalon 
But yes, all classes will be balanced around the existence of Multistrike. Celestalon 

Earth Shield does not seem to have an internal CD on procs in the WoD beta. Sometimes gone in a couple of GCDs. Intended?
I believe we're trying it out as such. Much more effective as a heal this way. However, may be too strong, or annoying. Celestalon 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Average? It's literally within the bottom 4 overall for 25HM SoO and bottom 3 for 10HM. It's underperforming overall
Looking at rankings for Demo is entirely deceptive, because most of the top Warlocks are Aff/Destro. Celestalon 

Any demo buffs? Literally no demos on ladder. Feels bad, man.
That's a tuning issue. And to be fair, it's a tuning issue with Aff/Destr, not Demo.We haven't done tuning yet. Celestalon 
It is a tuning issue with demo, actually. Demo has little ability to kill and little pressure against other players.
Oh, apologies, I was talking PvE. Celestalon 
So does this mean demo is going to stay same and des/aff is going to be slightly nerfed?
It should come as no shock to hear that Aff/Destro are overpowered on live. Celestalon 
It's HIGHLY underrepresented in medium to top end guilds, that isn't a coincidence
Demo is underrepresented because the Warlocks up there strongly favor Aff/Destro, not because it's weak Celestalon 
lolwut. It's underrepresented because it underperforms compared to Destro/Aff.
That's... exactly what I just said? Celestalon 
You can re-read your last post, if you'd like, to see where you're wrong.
Yeah, I don't get it. Demo is not UP; Aff/Destro are OP in PvE. Thus, top guilds' Warlocks are mostly Aff/Destro. Celestalon 
While they are OP, Demo is underpowered compared to almost every other single spec in the game. Again, bottom 4 25HM/bottom 3 10
And again, those rankings are useless. Celestalon 

Art
Can taurens get around 2 feet back? watching beta streams I noticed they lost a lot of height. They should look taller imo.
That's strange man - we matched skeletons one to one on all new PC's. It might be illusion w/ movement. We'll take a look artofcgrobinson 

Any chance of the old models of shaman totens being updated to match the new char models? great work on those models btw
I'd love to, it's on my radar. Totems are so cool, we could do a lot with updating them. No ETA, but I agree they need it artofcgrobinson 

Will we possibly see white skin color for Worgen in WoD? It's becoming a bit depressing being black, grey, grey or grey.
its now on the list. This would be something we might add after PC update. artofcgrobinson 

Will there be new faces added for each race or even the accessories you were looking into, like panda highlights?
Not at this stage. This is only an update of existing options in game. Would like to do so at some point, no eta artofcgrobinson 

Please tell me female draenei are getting longer tails that have animation. I'm so tired of of sausage tail!
This would be something we might add in the future after we update existing features. artofcgrobinson 

loving chars in beta, playing the chars is better then seeing in artcrafts, sad feather option for tauren horns is gone.
We might bring the feather back artofcgrobinson 

Knowing that nothing is yet final, are there any plans for an brighter orange dwarf hair color like the old one?
Been thinking about that, I agree we missed the value on that color. I'll look into it artofcgrobinson 

Thank you for taking a second look. We just want some feeling of diversity in the faces.
I hear ya, that's definitely our desire and goal at this stage. artofcgrobinson 

Is the new human female model definitive or is it subject to change? Can't see my old char reflected 
Definitely subject to change, we're now fine tuning each face, altering base pose to more closely match original structure/emotion artofcgrobinson 
in this case we will be adjusting eyebrows, as well as looking at eye color, lip color, mouth shape, etc. artofcgrobinson 
This is all part of our plan to address "same face". I had hoped to get out an Artcraft for this but tendon in finger detached - artofcgrobinson 

What about the undead empty eye socket faces? Any chance we'll get those back?
When we're finished - you should have everything you started with. We don't want to cut/lose any features. artofcgrobinson 

Male or female trolls next maybe? Pretty please? I think it's high time they've gotten an artcraft or at least*some* reveal
They'll be coming up soon. Had to model mouth in flat line, then use animation posing to form lips around tusks. Showing them artofcgrobinson 
without that posing would have been disastrous. Hence the wait They look great now - we'll get something out asap artofcgrobinson 

PvE
Chance we could have Beta Shatt Target Dummies on Live servers? Maybe a special room that is phased? Able to learn a lot there
It's something we're considering, but we'd want to kit them up a lot more. Celestalon 

PvP
will lower level skirmishes give XP? Would be a nice change from questing/dungeon leveling. Maybe like as much XP as a quest?
We're planning on granting some XP from skirmishes. holinka 

Will Ashran have solid trees, for LoS cover?
Trees have never had LoS in WoW for technical reasons. We're avoiding putting them in contested gameplay spaces. holinka 

Are there any plans to bring back mana burns/drains? From what I see, a lot of healers not getting punished for standing in los.
There are no plans to bring back mana burns/drains. holinka 

UI / Addons
will the limit of 50 mails be raised with wod?
No plans to change that - you can have far more than 50, but only 50 get displayed at once. WatcherDev 

Garrisons
How big will our garrisons grow eventually? Won't fit all of the buildings, I fear? Pick & choose the best ones? Can we rebuild?
Pretty large, but not large enough to have everything. You can bulldoze and change buildings as much as you want, though! Muffinus 

I thought there were 4 small plots has that changed now to 3? Also is the current design of requiring Alch to progress just for beta
On plots, current plan is 3 smalls at Tier 3 now. mumper 
So the fourth small is scrapped?
No tier 4, the Garrison upgrades from 1 to 3. Lots of iteration still in progress, hence "current plan" mumper 

how many large plots at the max teir and is that barracks, alchemy lab, town hall teir considered tier 1 for garisons?
Tier 1 currently has a small and a large plot for buildings. mumper 

No previously made statements imply that having a gathering prof improves the overall yield from your mine/garden/barn.
Both the Mine and Herb Garden will let folks without the matching gathering skill create work orders for mats. mumper 
Having the matching gathering skill will let you harvest the local garrison nodes in the mine/garden. mumper 
so will we get enough mats out of our garrison & should drop gathering or it will must supplement miserable ground based gathering
Will still be valuable to have gathering skills, don't want to lose that. mumper 

World
Is the return of darker night going into places like Elwynn Forest etc as well?
The plan is to get it in as many places as possible. mumper
