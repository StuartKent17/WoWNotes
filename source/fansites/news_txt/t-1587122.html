Before you can harbor any hope of defeating the Iron Horde, you must first understand what&#x2014;and whom&#x2014;you&#x2019;re up against. Our five-part series Lords of War introduces you to some of the major players in the campaign on Draenor&#x2014;beginning with the sadistic Kargath Bladefist, leader of the Shattered Hand, and continuing today with the mighty Grommash Hellscream, chieftain of the Warsong clan.<br>
<br>
Grommash Hellscream&#x2019;s legend was not born from mere brutality or conquest. His indomitable will helped him survive the impossible . . . but only after his recklessness nearly cost him everything.<br>
<br>
Once you&#x2019;ve watch his story, visit our newly posted Grommash Hellscream character page (http://battle.net/wow/game/lore/characters/grommash-hellscream) to read more about his legacy and his role in the events to come.<br>
