Warlords of Draenor - Nagrand Zone Preview
Today we are taking a look at Nagrand, which has seen significant updates since the original preview. Keep in mind that parts of the zone are clearly not finished.

MMO-Champion Forums Moderator Recruitment
Good news everyone! We're recruiting moderators for the forums again! The amount of users and posts keeps increasing and we reached the point where we need some help before the trolls take over and play Whack-a-Mod in the Darkmoon Faire. I know it sounds fun, but I'm going to assume we don't want that. 

Please be sure to read the entire post before applying!

Combined Revive Pet and Mend Pet
We actually had a similar idea: merging Revive Pet and Mend Pet. If your pet is alive and active, you'll cast Mend. If they're dead, you'll cast Revive instead. I don't believe that made it into the current Alpha build.

EDIT: Actually, looks like it did, but in an incomplete state. Next build should clean it up a bit. Blue Tracker [/b] ] Official Forums

Achievements
Possible for A Tribute to Dedicated Insanity come back? Kind of like how Herald of the titans stayed? It was fun going back.
Changes made to raid structure in Cataclysm broke the way we used to track ToC attempts, unfortunately; that's why it was removed. WatcherDev 

It would make more sense to have them under Dungeons and Raids -> Legacy if anything.
It's a new category for deprecated achievements. It has other stuff in it too, like "Loot 100 Stone Keeper Shards" WatcherDev 

Warlords of Draenor Stats
in regards to minor stats, is it random among end-game raid gear? ie. variance on BiS with the minor stat bonuses?
Yes, it'll be on end-game raid gear. Some gear that drops will randomly have a minor stat. Celestalon 

how will the new minor stats appear on PvP gear? Particular those purchased through CQP. Is hate to buy/sell cycle to get stats.
We don't plan on doing any random loot for conquest points. Possible that rolls from RBGs would have extra stats or gem slots. holinka 

Readiness stat that works like the new Echo of the Elements % chance to not invoke a CD on rotational abilities. Viable?
Not really. That'd be a huge wrench thrown in the gears of every spec's rotation, and is even less valuable than Readiness. Celestalon 
Does that imply that the new EotE is troublesome at the moment?
No, not at all. It just wouldn't work as a stat for most rotations. Works fine as a Shaman Talent. Celestalon 

How about readiness increasing both the cooldown recovery rate AND the potency of the cooldown?
We explored that, and many similar options. Problem there is that that further complicates it, then necessitates... Celestalon 
...adding a DR on top of that. And, still has problems with talents doubling or even tripling its value. Celestalon 

how does multistrike interact with paladin seals? with readiness gone does that mean seraphim is going to get reworked or gone?
Seal damage can Multistrike. Seraphim remains as is, except swap "Readiness" for "Versatility". Celestalon 

How will Multustrike work with chain jump ? u can have 1 CH 4jump + 8 multistrike proc 2 per each jump?
Each hit can multistrike, doing an additional hit of damage to just that target. ie, it affects each target individually Celestalon 

Can appropriate MS strikes proc mastery CS/TV/HoW?Can mastery proc MS?Can appropriate MS strikes proc seals CS/TV/Judge/Auto
Multistrikes cannot proc anything, unless specifically called out as such. Celestalon 

Does Leech trigger from any heals you perform on yourself?I assume no because it doesn't fit the name, but it's worth asking.
Despite it being a little weird for the name, Leech does work on self-heals except for Leech itself, of course. No infinite loops Celestalon 

PvP
my biggest problem with Pvp is the rudeness of other players, especially of my own faction. Much too serious.
It's a significant problem for sure. holinka 

will gladiator stance warriors be subject to the additional damage in Warlords PvP despite being DPS?
we'll see how it plays out but since they lose some of their tankiness, it's likely they wouldn't take extra damage. holinka 

Hey are there any plans yet to address faction imbalanced servers for Ashran? It might not be fun if there is no other faction
We will point multiple realms at the same instance of Ashran holinka 

World
Is FrostFire ridge going to be horde only, or can an alliance toon quest there? Wondering if I need to boost a horde char
Frostfire is a Horde-only leveling zone; Shadowmoon is Alliance-only. Everyone will have some endgame content in both. WatcherDev 

Garrisons
when the garrison building is upgrading or constructing. Will we see peons/peasants working on the building?
That's the plan! Muffinus 


Fire-Watcher's Oath Hotfix
After the Censer of Eternal Agony  hotfix yesterday , the Fire-Watcher's Oath  has been hotfixed to have a 10 minute cooldown, cost 100 Timeless Coins, and work while mounted. Improvements in battlegrounds may happen in the future
