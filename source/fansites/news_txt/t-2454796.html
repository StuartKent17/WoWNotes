Mythic Cache Next Week has Titan Residuum<br>
Immediately after the Tides of Vengeance update goes live with scheduled maintenance in each region, you&#x2019;ll now be able to target specific kinds of Azerite armor by earning Titan Residuum (https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-titan-residuum), which can be used to purchase Azerite armor from everyone&#x2019;s favorite purveyor of exquisite furnishings: Thaumaturge Vashreen (https://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/149045-thaumaturge-vashreen), who can be found alongside his fellow ethereals in either Boralus or Dazar&#x2019;alor.<br>
<br>
In the weekly cache, you&#x2019;ll now receive an amount of Titan Residuum in addition to your weekly item. Completing higher-level Keystones will award greater amounts of Titan Residuum from your weekly cache. Scrapping or disenchanting new epic-quality Azerite gear obtained in Tides of Vengeance (from any source) also provides Titan Residuum, with more powerful items yielding more Residuum.<br>
<br>
After the update goes live, your weekly cache will contain Titan Residuum, and will not have a chance to contain a piece of Azerite Armor. We suggest you complete at least one Mythic Keystone dungeon before the update to make sure that you earn Titan Residuum when you open your cache after the update.<br>
<br>
There isn&#x2019;t a cap on how much Titan Residuum you can hold, and we do not plan to reset Titan Residuum at the start of Season 2. When Season 2 begins, the vendor will offer higher item-level pieces (iLvl 400 or 415) at significantly higher costs than the Season 1 items. Also at that time, the weekly Mythic Keystone cache will begin rewarding proportionally more Residuum, and new iLvl 400+ Azerite armor will yield more Residuum when scrapped or disenchanted.<br>
See you in the dungeons!<br>
<br>
Yes. Completing Mythic Keystones higher than level 10 will yield more Residuum for each additional level, with diminishing returns.</div></div>
