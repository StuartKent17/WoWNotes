In the latest a lot of changes were made to the stat points distribution on plate sets, most of the time to add more strength at the expense of other stats. A few things were fixed on other sets (bonuses mostly) and I guess it&apos;s a good time for a recap! If you want to compare you can still check the old tier 8 stats post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=44966.0)<br>

Testing Cross-Language Battlegroups<br>
As previously announced, we are working on implementing Cross-Language Battlegroups (CLBG) to increase the size of most Battlegroups. You can find the original announcement here: http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=6425923570 (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=6425923570)<br>
<br>
The CLBG is currently open for testing on the PTRs, allowing players from the different PTRs to meet each other in the Battlegrounds and Arenas. This weekend we will be doing some focused testing of the Battlegrounds, and we will appreciate if you participate during this time:<br>
<br>
On Saturday 28th of March, focused Battleground testing will take place between 18:00 and 20:00 CET<br>
On Sunday 29th of March, focused Battleground testing will take place between 16:00 and 20:00 CEST (remember to adjust the clock!)<br>
<br>
We will be thankful for your feedback about any bugs and issues encountered during the focused testing, and we will be especially interested in hearing if players from another PTR join a Battleground on the same side as you.<br>
<br>
Please keep this thread to test reports, and take general discussion of the feature in this other thread: http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=8136835748 (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=8136835748)</div></div>
