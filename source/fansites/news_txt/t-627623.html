Recently we have implemented a number of measures in regards to this issue. We are keen in hearing your feedback about your gaming experience from this point on. Please remember we are actively monitoring the situation and will continue to inform you of our progress. <br>
<br>
<br>
Dual-specialization - Q&amp;A<br>
<br>
Will the current respec costs be reset or will they stay at the current 50g max? <br>
If you mean will respec costs be changed permanently, no. If you mean will the costs be reset or will you get a free respec when this goes live, possibly. <br>
<br>
How about the cost of our second spec? If the respec fee starts out at 10c or 1s (I forgot what it starts as) shouldn&apos;t our &quot;main&quot; respec fee be reset? <br>
A respec should be a respec. <br>
<br>
In regards to hunters and exotic pets. If I spec into the 51 point talent and I go to switch to survival how will I change pets? You said you wanted it to be somewhat easy to switch between specs but nothing trivial. Will we have a second pet that is automatically summoned when we switch specs? What about the extra four points our pet&apos;s talent trees have? How will those be taken away or replaced when changing specs?<br>
We have a solution for pets, but we&apos;re not ready to announce it yet. You&apos;ll like it.<br>
<br>
Are there any plans to make switching gear sets easier? Healers, tanks and dps roles usually carry more than one set of gear. It can take up a lot of bag space and can be rather annoying at times. Is there a way to have your gear automatically switch when you change specs? <br>
Not automatically, but we&apos;re aware of the issue and dual spec would be a really opportune time to examine it. <br>
<br>
How do you think dual specs will affect addons that modify the action bars? It seems like it will be a hit and miss. The addons will either become broken or no harm, no foul and the addons work as intended.<br>
I&apos;m sure the addon authors will figure out how to make them work with the new system. Things can sometimes be a little rocky just following a patch if you use a lot of addons. <br>
<br>
Dual-spec mechanics<br>
We haven&apos;t finalized the design, because ideally we want to be able to get it on a PTR and have players try it out.<br>
<br>
Our thought at the moment is that swapping specs (going from A to B) will truly be free in towns and possibly during the prep phase of PvP. In an instance it may cost a nominal fee (think reagent level). We want you to be able to do it when you want to do it, but we also don&apos;t want to slow things down if everyone is constantly flipping spec from fight to fight. But if it&apos;s free in town, then obviously it can&apos;t be more of a burden out of town than just hearthing and being summoned back is or nobody will use the remote option.<br>
<br>
Someone helpfully quoted our response on why we are likely to launch the feature with &quot;only&quot; 2 specs. <br>

Blue posts<br>
Are existing versions of Je&apos;Tze&apos;s Bell (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=37835) getting changed to BoE in 3.0.8 as well?<br>
Any updates made to items apply to all items. So, yes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/13908941058-jetzes-bell--did-yours-become-boe.html))<br>
<br>
Haste in Melee<br>
We are looking at the benefits of haste (or lack thereof) for all melee right now. If anything there aren&apos;t enough stats available to make items distinct, so rather than swap out a less desirable stat with a more desirable one, we&apos;d rather make the less desirable one desirable.

<br>
Enchanting materials in WotLK<br>
In BC we thought that dust was too common and enchants were basically gated by the cost and availability of shards. We wanted to adjust this for LK and in retrospect overcompensated, such that dust is now the rare, limiting reagent.<br>
<br>
As Excrusiate points out (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=13832865667&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#1), this should be better next patch. <br>
<br>
Wintergrasp in 3.0.8<br>
It is slightly confusing. Wintergrasp has been reworked in 3.0.8. From what I have been told, players start off at Recruit Rank if they are in the zone and require a certain number of kills to get to Corporal and use vehicles. They get 1 Mark at Recruit, 2 at Corporal, and 3 at 1st Lt. So the only change is that being in the zone now gives you a mark.

<br>
Bug - Huge DPS increase in raids<br>
We think we know what is causing this bug and think we have fixed it. <br>
<br>
We&apos;re not too worried about this bug because it is rare and probably impossible to produce on demand.<br>
<br>
We did think it was fixed however, so if anyone has parses from relatively recently (say Dec 14+) please let us know. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13275298048-gc-11k-dps-as-feral-on-patchwerk-explain.html))<br>

Protection paladins in PvP<br>
Ultimately, we&apos;d love to get Prot paladins as viable as Ret or Holy, but we realize we have long way to go. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/13909381104-twisting-gcs-words-for-protadin-pvp.html))<br>

Hymns<br>
We still have plans to make some changes to the Hymns, but changes like that typically A) require a lot of discussion, B) are more technically intensive changes (which also can lead to bugs if not thoroughly tested) or both.

Shields bugs on feral druids[b]<br>
Absorbs not (always) working is a known issue and should be easy to fix. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13909381054-disc-priests-and-druid-tanks.html))<br>
<br>
[b]Priests versatility<br>
You can only take that &quot;priests are versatile&quot; design too far or yes you will get into them either being better than everyone or jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none.<br>
<br>
You have to look at the tools the priest has. Prayer of Mending is an amazing spell, and nobody has anything like that. Binding Heal is an interesting spell that will perhaps see more use after the Circle nerf. PW:Shield, SW:Death, Mass Dispel and Shadowfiend are all unusual mechanics that don&apos;t directly map to another class.<br>
<br>
For us, it always comes down to questions such as: Will Holy priests get invited to heal 5-player groups, raids and (in a perfect world) Arena teams? Will a raid feel like they are giving up something to bring a priest instead of a druid, paladin or shaman? Do groups do different things when they have healing priests? Do priests care about the same items, buffs, debuffs and mechanics as other healers?<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t beleive groups really organize themselves around healing niches in the sense that they want one hot guy, one AE guy and two direct heal guys. We just want enough distinction that you consider bringing e.g. a druid as your third healer once you have two priests.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/shaman.jpg Shaman (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=660) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?shaman))<br>
Elemental DPS increase in 3.0.8<br>
This is why I am often reluctant to post actual numbers. I think they end up launching more questions than actually providing answers.<br>
<br>
The 10 to 12% number I quoted was the additional amount we wanted to add with the changes post-Shamanism. If you recall, we did two rounds of buffs on Elemental. The first juggled the talent tree a little bit (and introduced Shamanism). The second changed a couple of additional talents (Elemental Oath, Elemental Mastery and the change to the Lightning Bolt glyph).<br>
<br>
For an Elemental in Naxx 25 gear, *each* of these rounds should have increased dps by about 10% between patch 3.0.3 and patch 3.0.8, for a total of about 20%. If you are in heroic blues and don&apos;t have as much spellpower, then you won&apos;t see quite such a lift from the first (Shamanism) round of changes.<br>
<br>
Note that the build on the PTR only contains the first round of changes, IIRC. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13770007972-gc-more-elemental-shaman-numbers.html))<br>
<br>
Spirit Walk not breaking roots for the Shaman<br>
This issue has been documented internally and is one of the major bugs we have scheduled to fix. That said, it won&apos;t be ready in time for 3.0.8. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/13832775644-bug--fix-spirit-walk.html))<br>
<br>
Riptide / Earthliving bugs<br>
Thanks for the feedback. We think we have isolated the Riptide and Earthliving bugs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13832765378-swiftmend-consuming-riptide.html))<br>

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/warlock.jpg Warlock (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=680) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warlock))<br>
Warlocks in WotLK<br>
I did post a list of what we wanted to do with warlocks in LK and now that we have done those changes, we have a new list of what we want to look at in warlocks next. A few players linked it. I could have found the quote myself but I figured the community would be able to do it faster, which they did.<br>
<br>
I am sorry if my communication sometimes seems disjoined. Reading all of these threads takes a great deal of time that I try to squeeze in during my other responsibilities. To some extent you&apos;re going to get what you&apos;re going to get. That may not sit well, but the alternatives are to give up on posting altogether or at least post a lot less frequently. I don&apos;t see a way I will be able to spend more time here than I do already. (As most of you know, I&apos;m not a CM. I also don&apos;t want to hire people to read the forums for me, because that defeats the purpose. But I do have a lot going on.)<br>
<br>
I think there is some truth to the notion that after enough tweaks here and there that you need to step back and take a big look at the class as a whole. I think we&apos;ve reached this point with warlocks. We are satisfied with the changes we wanted to make in BC, which included things like giving Affliction more competitive damage, giving Destruction more than one button to push, and getting Demonology to consider more different types of demons. When I say we want to make some changes to the class, I would not interpret this as burning warlocks to the ground and starting over. Overall it&apos;s still a really cool and distinctive play style.<br>
<br>
I&apos;ll reach for an analogy here, which can be illustrative but will also break if streteched too far, as all analogies do. We&apos;ve spent some time checking the tire pressure and vacuuming out the interior, but every few thousand miles you want to actually pop the hood, check all the belts and hoses, and possibly even rebuild the engine. That is not the same as driving her off a cliff and then hitting the dealers for a newer model. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13832555390-warlock-class-design.html))<br>
<br>
Talent spec in PvP<br>
In an ideal world, we don&apos;t want Demonology (or any spec for any class) to be THE PvP tree. This is tougher with the pure dps classes because any spec that sacrifices all for dps feels like a PvE spec and any spec that has survivability, crowd control or escape tools feels like a PvP spec. Long term though it is definitely a goal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13832925851-warlock-pvp-what-i-dont-want.html))<br>
<br>
Pets and Fear in PvP<br>
<br>
That is the goal. I think we&apos;ve done better at Affliction wanting the felhunter, Destruction wanting the imp and Demonology wanting the felguard, at least in PvE. We would like to get the succubus and voidwalker into Arenas more. We have some ideas....<br>
<br>
On fear....<br>
<br>
We still like the change to how fear works overall. Because it can be broken it&apos;s less of a long-term CC, but it&apos;s also more consistent in the short-term.<br>
<br>
However, I think a lot of the consternation about warlock PvP comes from losing fear as an amazing source of CC (probably replaced by stuns now which probably isn&apos;t a good thing), coupled with losing some of the &quot;tankiness&quot; locks had before, but without giving you all of the get out of jail cards that a mage has.<br>
<br>
Ultimately I think we actually do want locks to survive through mitigation (when compared to survival through CC or escape mechanisms). The trick is nailing this compromise between plate-wearers who stand and take it and glass cannons who run away. There is probably something to the fact that locks and hunters both feel like they can&apos;t stand and fight and can&apos;t get away from melee. It&apos;s the mail-wearer paradox. I know you don&apos;t wear mail per se, but we&apos;re pushing you closer to that than we are the slippery mage.

Protection Warriors in PvP<br>
Prot warriors are better at PvP than they used to be. They still aren&apos;t as attractive as Arms and Fury. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/13909381104-twisting-gcs-words-for-protadin-pvp.html))<br>

Protection Warrior bugs fixes in 3.0.8<br>
These are known issues. I can&apos;t recall off the top of my head if we&apos;ve been able to fix them for 3.0.8 or if they required technical changes.<br>
<br>
Mostly I wanted to add that we fix several hundred bugs in patches like this. The patch notes typically only record big changes -- the kinds that might confuse players if they weren&apos;t explained. We usually only call out bug fixes if they were so common that people had really gotten used to the buggy state.
