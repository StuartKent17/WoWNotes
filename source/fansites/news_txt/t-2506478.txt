Stoy2019-08-30, 12:39 PMTwo New WoW Classic Realms Opening In This Region
August 31st at 6 PM PDT, we will open two new WoW Classic Realms in this region:

Anathema - PvP - Pacific
Netherwind - PvP - Eastern

We strongly encourage players who wish to avoid extended queues on crowded PvP realms to plan to move to one of these two new realms. We expect these new realms to have a population base that is easily sufficient to long support a healthy PvP realm community.

Thank you!
