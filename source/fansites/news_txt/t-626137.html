Due to population differences between the highest and lowest populated PvP realms, the following Free Character Migration will be available from December 10th to 16th:<br>
<br>
From: Burning Legion, Drak&apos;thul, Sylvanas<br>
To: Boulderfist, Mazrigos, Vek&apos;nilash<br>
<br>
Please note that this migration may be closed at any time should a destination realm&apos;s population rise too high.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions about this specific migration, please feel free to add them below. However, note that migration is opened based on realm population analysis, not popular demand, so requests for other free migrations will not be responded to.<br>

[EU] New Chamber of Aspects PvE realm<br>
Free migrations to Chamber of Aspects have been closed for this time. Any future migrations will be handled along with other free migrations. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/6848456286-1411-new-migration-pve-realm.html))<br>

Stun mechanics<br>
In some situations, stuns can feel really overpowered and players on the receiving end of them can feel really helpless.<br>
<br>
So, we could treat stuns a lot more like we do other forms of CC.<br>
<br>
However, we have built a few specs around their stuns (rogues obviously, but Ret and other specs benefit from it too). These would need to be buffed significantly to compensate. For example, a rogue who can&apos;t stun as often or as for long would need a lot of defenses to compensate. Currently, preventing an opponent from attacking is one of their strongest defenses.<br>
<br>
We totally understand the contingent of players who think excessive stuns just aren&apos;t fun. We did back off on several of the proc-a-stun mechanics in the game already. It is something we&apos;re talking about. Obviously I don&apos;t an announcement of incoming changes or I would have made them already.

Blizzard &quot;Balance&quot; team<br>
There is no &quot;balance team.&quot; WoW has a systems design team composed of game designers. Some of these designers have many years of industry experience while others were recruited because of their expert theorycrafting or in-game skill (and often both). The systems design team is responsible for everything from combat mechanic, achievement, and UI design to tradeskill, class and item design. It is one of the strongest design teams in the entire industry, which I feel like I can say, because several of us have been around in this industry for some time.<br>
<br>
In addition to the kind of tests we can do at our desk, we also rely on a large and experienced QA team to find bugs and test implementation. We also have a terrific community team that helps to funnel us information from these and other forums. We also have a lot of contacts among expert players and theorycrafters, in both PvP and cutting-edge raiding, out there who serve as a reality check for what we do internally. We talk to players all the time, through email, through the game, or through forums. All of these are pieces of the process and I would be hard-pressed to say which is the most valuable or has the most influence.<br>
<br>
All told, it is a very robust process and I think that WoW is so fun and has such a large and dedicated audience speaks for itself. I won&apos;t claim that we never make mistakes. Sometimes players go in a different direction than we predicted. Sometimes they find powerful combinatorial effects that we didn&apos;t know existed. Sometimes they just play better than we anticipated. Sometimes they use exploits. WoW is a very large game with a very large community. Stuff is just going to come up. It happens in any kind of game, and especially in an MMO. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13275172692-anybody-trust-blizzards-testers.html))<br>

Denyin&apos; the Scion (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2148) too hard for tanks and healers?<br>
While this may be a little extra challenging for tanks and healers, if you are pushing to complete some of the hardest achievements in the game, it doesn&apos;t seem very hard to coordinate and make this happen.

Hunter nerfs<br>
This isn&apos;t a Ret paladin issue and it&apos;s not really a PR issue.<br>
<br>
When we make changes, we prefer to make enough changes to actually fix the problem so we can move on. There are a lot of different aspects of the game we want to touch so we&apos;d rather not still be dealing with hunter dps imabalance months from now.<br>
<br>
I admit when we make mistakes in our numbers. But you shouldn&apos;t turn that into our numbers never being close to the mark. Lack of perfection does not translate into a total mess.<br>
<br>
Another reason we like the Steady Shot change is it puts more emphasis on the instant and other hunter shots. Steady is a good bread and butter ability but it&apos;s not much more interesting than auto shot. We&apos;d like to see Aimed Shot, Multi Shot, Arcane Shot and other abilities be what the player focuses on. When you get such a big chunk of damage from auto + steady, it makes those other attacks feel puny and the fact you have to use them feel annoying.

Upcoming Hunter changes main post<br>
We also had to delete many and ban many posters who couldn&apos;t figure out the proper kind of response for these threads. It is sad that I have to mention it, but since the bannings aren&apos;t public I feel the need to warn everyone to consider what you are about to do before you push that Post button. If your reponse gets deleted, nobody is going to read it anyway. If you get banned, you are just going to lose the opportunity to ever comment on changes.<br>
<br>
You are welcome to disagree with us, and many people have. But you all are smart enough to know the difference between intelligent discussion and pointless QQ. That also goes for any of the people banned for coming into gloat or flame the hunters. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=13275172587&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=63#1245))<br>
