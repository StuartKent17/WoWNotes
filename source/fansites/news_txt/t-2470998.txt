Patch 8.1.5 PTR - Cycle of Life Tortollan Quest
The PTR has added an interesting new world quest to the Tortollan lineup called the Cycle of Life. 


It takes place with Scrollsage Nola https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/134344-scrollsage-nola and can spawn anywhere that the baby turtle quest Beachhead resides.
This quest is very different from helping baby turtles to the water. Upon reaching it, Nola will tell you "These tiny crabs need help! I hate to see any living things suffer. Would you be willing to lend a hand?"
You then take control of a crab and must move left or right in order to block baby turtles from reaching the water whilst avoiding the orb attacks from Scroll of Blasting https://www.wowdb.com/spells/292149-scroll-of-blasting.
After blocking a baby turtle, its shell will appear on your head and you can use Throw Turtle Shell https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/292287-throw-turtle-shell to take out any baby turtles in a line up the beach.
The quest ends when you block 20 baby turtles from the water. Nola exclaims "All creatures in nature must live together in balance. But I can't help cheering for the little turtles!"
