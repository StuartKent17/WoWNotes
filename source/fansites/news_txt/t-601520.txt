Boubouille2007-07-12, 02:36 PMIGN  posted their article concerning Zul'aman from the E3. You can get the full version here 

Most important informations are :
Zul'aman loots will be superior to what you can get in Karazhan.
There will be less loots than in Karazhan.
It will be shorter to finish the instance, you can perfectly complete it in one night.
The first boss is the bear god, who can also drops a bear mount. Very rare drop, as usual
There will be troll scouts, who will flee once they spot you and will come back with adds if you don't stop them before they reach the war drums. 
The Dragonhawk god uses fire-based attacks and got tons of adds to help. 
Nothing new on the final encounter with Zul'jin, he'll use the different aspects of the previous bosses. 



Also got a confirmation that the voice chat and guild banks will be released before Zul'aman. Considering that the instance seems pretty much finished, I'd say we can expect it very soon. 

Spectral Tiger
I did a short video with the Spectral Tiger, because it's definitely way too hard to get proper screenshots of him. The color of the armor on the tiger probably won't be this one when it's released.
