We&#x2019;ve heard your feedback (and experienced it ourselves) &#x2013; there can be lopsided faction representation during the &#x201C;Battle for Nazjatar&#x201D; event. We&#x2019;ve seen cases where only one faction is represented.<br>
<br>
To address this, we&#x2019;ve now changed it via hotfix so the &#x201C;Battle for Nazjatar&#x201D; will only become active when Nazjatar has a good mix of both Horde and Alliance players in War Mode. When that is not the case, an alternative event will become active called &#x201C;Azshara&#x2019;s Elite Commanders.&#x201D; This is also available to players who are not in War Mode, and it also awards Nazjatar Battle Commendations for slaying Elite commanders during the event.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re continuing to monitor and investigate reports of server lag during the event, and we&#x2019;re acting on feedback about significantly imbalanced areas. We&#x2019;ll let you know as we make further changes.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your patience and continued feedback!</div></div>
