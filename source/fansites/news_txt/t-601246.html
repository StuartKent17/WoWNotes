They also had a nice idea and decided to compare the new 2.1.0 PTR patch notes with the old ones to highlight the changes. Check out the article on their site ! (http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/05/01/ptr-changes-for-may-1/)<br>
<br>
General<br>
Inspect distance has been increased to 30 yards (from 10 yards).<br>
The amount of parry rating needed to get 1% parry has been reduced by 25%.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
The new battleground matchmaking system is now implemented and active. This system allows the battleground to select teams of similar equipment quality and organizational level to battle each other. For now, the system will be very forgiving about creating matchups in order to keep queue times low. However, the parameters will be adjusted as necessary when more organized teams become active in the battlegrounds.<br>
