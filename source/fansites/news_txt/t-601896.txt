Sunday, no news, you can leave this site. No, actually, I updated a few things.
The Hall of Fame http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=251 was updated with better screenshots, basically it just means that I removed most of the old annoying watermarks on the older kills.
I realized that some pages like the Consumables list http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=40 still had old items, I updated most of them a few weeks ago but some still had old version stats. Everything should be updated now. 



It's not like anyone use these pages, but they still deserved an update. 

Skin changes in 2.2
The [item=32500] skin was changed in the 2.2 patch, it looks a lot better now. Thanks to shujenka

Tempest Keep / Serpentshrine Cavern movie
Considering how popular Curse's Black Temple video was, it's time for another video to keep you busy on sunday. Numen http://www.numen-guild.com/ released a very nicely edited movie of Serpentshrine Cavern and Tempest Keep. You can get tons of details about the movie in this post http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=612473755&sid=1 and you can watch it below if you've got the DiVX plugin from stage6. If you don't, download it, or try this link http://stage6.divx.com/user/Qvist/video/1586459/Vials-of-Eternity but you'll need it anyway
