Sunday, no news, you can leave this site. No, actually, I updated a few things.
The Hall of Fame  was updated with better screenshots, basically it just means that I removed most of the old annoying watermarks on the older kills.
I realized that some pages like the Consumables list  still had old items, I updated most of them a few weeks ago but some still had old version stats. Everything should be updated now. 



It's not like anyone use these pages, but they still deserved an update.

Tempest Keep / Serpentshrine Cavern movie
Considering how popular Curse's Black Temple video was, it's time for another video to keep you busy on sunday. Numen  released a very nicely edited movie of Serpentshrine Cavern and Tempest Keep. You can get tons of details about the movie in this post  and you can watch it below if you've got the DiVX plugin from stage6. If you don't, download it, or try this link  but you'll need it anyway
