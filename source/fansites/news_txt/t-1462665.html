Blizzard organized a couple of press tours in Europe and Korea and interesting info about the new expansion is starting to appear on the web.<br>
<br>
Mamytwink.com (http://www.mamytwink.com/) got to play the expansion for 5 hours and gave his impressions (http://www.mamytwink.com/actualite/press-tour-resume-de-5-heures-de-jeu-sur-warlords) along with a couple interesting spoilers. Below is a rough translation of original article (http://www.mamytwink.com/actualite/press-tour-resume-de-5-heures-de-jeu-sur-warlords): <br>
<br>
Leveling and Other Numbers<br>
<br>
I played a gnome warrior in the Shadowmoon Valley, the Alliance starting zone. After about 5 hours of /played and 80 quests I reached the end of the zone and Level 92.<br>
At level 91, I had 63k health as a Tank.<br>
Monsters had around 100k health.<br>
I was dealing around 1k to 5k damage on normal hits. Up to 10k critical damage for some abilities (Shield Slam).<br>
It takes 597k XP to go from level 90 to level 91 and 640k xp to go from level 91 to 92.<br>
Quests rewards were between 10k and 15k xp. Up to 20k for the difficult ones. <br>
A new quest type is available: the &quot;Bonus Objectives&quot;. When you walk around a zone, new objectives might appear randomly in your quest list. Completing the objectives will reward you with extra experience, leaving the area will drop the quest. <br>
<br>
<br>
Shadowmoon Valley<br>
<br>
Shadowmoon Valley is composed of lush green plains lit by the moonlight. It has a very peaceful feeling. The glades and forests are amazing and very colorful. You will find Naarus, Draeneis cities, and Iron Horde strongholds in the zone. <br>
The Alliance starting zone seems pretty much finished. Lots of details, impressive vegetation, and a lot of different monsters.<br>
I found a lot of monsters from The Burning Crusade that have been updated: Talbuks, Nether rays, Turtles, Larvas, Boars, Sporebats, Wolves, Bees. The new Talbuks and Sporebats models are EPIC.<br>
Ner&apos;zhul is the principal antagonist of the zone.<br>
The zone ends with a scenario that I couldn&apos;t test because it wasn&apos;t available. It was called &quot;Grommar&apos;s Purge&quot; (Note: roughly translated)<br>
I found the zone really well made. The vast plains and colorful glades immerse you entirely in the game. The scenery is new and doesn&apos;t give you a feeling of deja vu (except for some monsters, but it&apos;s not really shocking). <br>
<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
<br>
The new race models are great (I could also create a female dwarf). The facial expressions are awesome!<br>
The new soundtrack is also very good.<br>
When asked about the beta, Ion Hazzikostas answered : SoonTM.<br>
<br>
<br>
SPOILER The zone ends with a pretty huge storyline twist, only click the line below if you do not care about spoilers. You should probably stay away from the comments of this news as well.<br>
<br>
Ner&apos;zhul uses an evil force, the Void Terror. At the end of the zone, you fight Ner&apos;zhul and he manages to corrupt a Naaru into a &quot;Dark Naaru&quot;. To purify the Naaru, Velen sacrifices himself and dies. This is a pretty huge plot twist and his death will be part of a cinematic at the end of the quest. It is followed by a giant battle. You join Maraad (freed from Ner&apos;zhul earlier) to fight the Iron Horde. <br>
