Armory Stats - Battleground Win Ratios
Today we are taking a look at the win percentage for each faction and battleground that took place in the last month. To find these numbers, we compared the number of battles and victories a character had in a December snapshot of data to a January snapshot of data.

These numbers come from a character's statistics pane, so any bugs with character statistics will have skewed the results. This means that there isn't any way for us to verify how accurate these numbers are, so do not take them as fact.

Percentages came fairly close to 100% in most cases, so we normalized the data to 100%. Unfortunately it seems that most Eye of the Storm wins are still not recorded in your statistics most of the time. This bug has been around for five or more years now, but we normalized the data we had ~7.9% and ~9.8% win ratios for each faction for the chart. 

The data used today is a sample made up of ~7 million level 90 characters and ~16 million battles. The sample is slightly biased, as players who are not in a guild are less likely to appear in our sample. 

You can see the data from the last time we did this back in 2011 http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2187-Battleground-Horde-Alliance-Win-Ratio-Setup-of-the-Month, which shows a slightly different picture.

Upcoming Siege of Orgrimmar Changes
I agree. I also am not sure why removing the trivial healing mechanic from Sigecrafter is even...worth it. Most guilds are 4 healing this encounter to kill it, now it's definitely going to be a 4 heal fight. Directly after your tuned for 6-8 fight, Thok. ???
Raid groups are largely making steady progress, but as I said, there are exceptions. Regarding Heroic difficulty in particular, it's pretty obvious that there is a very large jump in difficulty from Thok to Siegecrafter. Siegecrafter/Paragons/Garrosh are currently very close to equal in difficulty, with each presenting different challenges and guilds taking roughly the same number of attempts to defeat each. We'd rather see an upward slope in difficulty, which leaves guilds feeling like the next step is within reach given enough time and dedication, rather than a sudden jump up to a much higher difficulty plateau. That's why we're nerfing Heroic Blackfuse moderately, Paragons just a little bit, and Garrosh not at all.

The changes shouldn't be enough to meaningfully alter healer composition, but they will make some of those "combo" deaths to two damage sources overlapping a bit less likely. 

I'm certain that guilds who have already defeated these encounters or who are on the verge of doing so will find that the adjustments make a big difference, but remember, that's because you've already refined a working strategy and have practiced the execution. Guilds coming into the fights for the first time will still need to handle the precise movement associated with the different Blackfuse phases, belt teams will have to learn to navigate the belt lasers consistently, and so forth. Both Blackfuse and Paragons will remain quite challenging. And then there's always Garrosh....

I've been asking to allow us to make uncorrupted orcs for a while. Any chance of that happening???
can't definitively say yes, but it's likely that will be an option in some way. It would be cool to see UO PC in Azeroth Source https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/420240346287579136

Would it really be that difficult to update the goblin/worgen models? You guys surely still have the original LoDs, right?
I'd like to at some point, they still use our original rigging/animation system. Pandaren introduced new system. Source https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/420010766842871808

Character / Items
Will [Ai-Li's Skymirror] ever be allowed to copy one's character illusion again? Ex: Grasp from Pre-ZF? An updated WoD version?
Those are fun, but we don't want it to become annoying, and that opens up too many possibilities. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420066414142054400

Warlords of Draenor Stats
Will Disc at least be fixed to do double healing from a multistrike crit. Else it is 100% useless stat for Disc.
I think you may misunderstand something. Crits don't do doublehealing for Disc, as a rule. But how does that make MS useless? Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420311774638772224
Sorry, said that backwards, when a spell crit as Disc procs MS, the MS is just as powerful as non-crit, makes it feel weak
You're misunderstanding Multistrike. The healing of the hit that triggered multistrike doesn't matter. Separate healing roll. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420428623003144192
And an MS that crits would trigger Divine Aegis. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420428755710914560

I keep seeing promises that the item squish won't affect soloing capabilities, but is this for all characters or only level 90s?
All. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420365820015804416
That is to say; the squish won't affect soloing capabilities, but other changes may. Soloing at low levels isn't a balance focus. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420366130876674048

Does this mean that we'll start seeing the new stats possibly mastery even on gear at very low levels?
Mastery is staying lvl80+. New stats are still being determined, but most likely not available from level 1. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420066849296891905

PvE
I hope this wouldn't replace Warstomp. I know it's not the best for PvE DPS but great for questing/soloing as a caster druid.
No, we wouldn't replace Warstomp. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420066065830256640

PvP
That is good news! Are you planning to increase base resilience with the new season?
Yes Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420653520820256768

How big in game scale wise is Ashran? Like are we talking AV big or Wintergrasp big
From base to base is similar to AV but it's wider. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420348121730654208
Would you say Ashran is a spiritual successor to AV? Or more like Timeless Isle?
More like AV Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420373947289309184

back to gear being the major determining factor in PvP success. Guess the accessibility experiment didn't work out?
I don't really see how you came to that conclusion. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420059429690552320
dialing back resilience "as much as possible" says bursty PvP and emphasizes PvP power. Sounds like old times 2 me.
In WoD, health pools will be relatively larger and PvP Power is being redefined. It will end up less bursty. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420071620997156865
Is this true for low lvl PvP too? Some spells are too potent in heirloom gear. Aimed Shot and Shield Slam can *literally* one-shot.
A lot of spells have base damage which leads to this issue. We're going through these spells to reduce the base damage. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420300460524720129

so I was wondering if you guys could start doing realm rankings/leaders instead of region? A lot of friends and I are curious.
We've gotten the request a lot so we'll have to look into it. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420072710232735749
"Instead"? Why not "in addition to"?
Certainly what I meant Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420179154944794624

It also feels lousy to work hard to acquire full grievous gear only to be killed by a dragon slayer in heroic pve gear
Yup, we've mentioned we don't want to end up in this situation again. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420060806152085504
but I give you credit in admiting that what occurred was not what you intended.
Certain systems like warforged and upgrades that inflate ilevels didn't make much sense for PvP. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420070028499619840
PvP not having them meant gear falling further behind. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420070055280250881

I've already given you a good solution. Nerf dmg/healing by 65/55% and roll those numbers into a raid wide buff for players who pve
It isn't a good solution for the same reasons base resilience and battle fatigue aren't good solutions. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420054481389121536
The entire reason why you needed BF/Resil is because abilities do too much damage/healing.
It's lousy to have a spell hit for 100k against a creature and 20k against a player no matter where you increase/decrease it. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420058924553732096

as horde I frequently spend more time in random BG queue then in the actual games. Fix it please. Faction conflict !> fast queues
I wish it could be fixed quickly. I really do. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420059546095071232

Warlords of Draenor
Didnt know where to ask. Blizzcon mention quest items gone from bank in WoD. Will my [Amulet of Draconic Subversion] disappear?
Don't know yet. Could be considered a Toy, perhaps. If you still have the quest, may be kept. Very up in the air, know important Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420065883440939008
