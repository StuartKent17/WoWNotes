Mists of Pandaria is the next WoW Expansion
This is official, Mists of Pandaria is the new expansion and it will feature the pandarens  as the playable race, along with a new class and of course tons of new zones, dungeons, etc! 

It will not feature a main vilain, and will mainly focus on the Horde vs Alliance war. 

Stay tuned for a shitstorm of updates, literally. NEW EXPANSION!
