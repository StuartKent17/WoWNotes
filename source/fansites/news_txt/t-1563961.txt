Warlords of Draenor - Mage Tier 6 Recolor
One of the recent beta builds added a nice recolor of the Mage Tier 6 armor set.

Warlords of Draenor Features
The OP appears to be a copy/paste from a forum reply on MMO-Champion http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1543050-quot-Promised-content-quot?p=27890428&viewfull=1#post27890428, which is unfortunate as almost everything listed is just incorrect, if not intentionally misleading. Reading it I'm tempted to say it's a well crafted troll because ... I'll say: because of the outlandishness of some of the claims, but the fact that it has so many upvotes here tells me that either people didn't read it, or they're agreeing with something that promotes their general feeling without counting on any of the specific points being made.

Being wary of a feature or direction is absolutely warranted, being unhappy or even upset about something is something we want to know about, providing feedback and telling us how you feel about something is critical to us so we can create an excellent gaming experience, but it's so absolutely important that everyone be curious, and research, and want to learn, and become knowledgeable, and use that knowledge to empower what they themselves think and say. I see a lot of people here are being critical of the points listed, which restores some of me, but so many are assuming the things they're told are true, and that's a poisonous way to ... hell, to go through life, let alone how to feel about a video game.

Simply repeating what someone else said is so very easy, and especially in this case, a good way to undermine your own voice. Have a voice, be critical, but do it because you have something to say. That is what is helpful, and that is what we want to hear.

For those in the thread attempting to inform people of what is accurate, we appreciate your effort. We'll try to step it up to help you out.

Sorry Bashiok, but OP is right about a number of things, including the massive amounts of cuts to content on launch, low number of dungeons, and extreme dumbing down of PVE. Look at the forest from outside of the trees. You and the rest of the devs.
Massive cuts of what? Faction hubs being in a different place? There are 7 dungeons + an updated max level UBRS. What does extreme dumbing down mean? This kind of response is the exact point of my previous reply.

Ability pruning for one.
After 10 years of adding more and more abilities, there's a point when we need to take a critical look at all that we have wrought. We can't just constantly add more and more and more abilities to the game forever and expect it to hold up under the weight of itself. Our intent as a company is always to design simple systems with lots of fun gameplay depth. Easy to learn difficult to master is our motto. Having tons of abilities does not necessarily make a game deep or fun, just complex. We've posted these exact points many times. If you disagree with Blizzard's core design principles, or any specific changes being made, we'd be happy to hear specific feedback, but saying a game is going to be bad because there are less class abilities is not particularly helpful, or even accurate.

This thread is getting a lot of attention, which is unfortunate, as it's chock full of misinformation. Let me clarify what I can:

-Black Temple and Frostwolf keep no longer hub cities, just quest locations you visit once.
They won't be hub cities, true. They're a bit more than "just quest locations you visit once," though.

-New faction cities are copy pastes of the 4.1 krasarang wilds faction bases in ashran, an island in nowhere
Even in their current state in Beta, this is false. They don't look anything like the Krasarang bases. Also, they're nowhere near complete in the current build. They'll look closer to what we're aiming for in the next one.

-Garrisons only in one zone now, no longer customization, no longer lets you name npcs, no longer has skill boosts, is just a daily quest hub phased to you.
True, false, true, false, extremely false.

-average class goes from 40 spells to 7
I'd double check your math. We pruned some abilities, but in even the most extreme cases it wasn’t nearly that many.

-no new skeletons or animations, literally every creature in the expansion is a remodelled creature.
False. Even the new character models are getting re-done animations.

-portions of entire zones are copy pasted from the BC devset
False. Everything has been built from scratch.

-the rest are not flying compatible and have 2d jpg mountains -now you know why shamans had far sight and hunters had eagle vision removed.
False. Every zone is built to be capable of flying, and I have no idea where you're getting "2d jpg mountains" from. Also, Far Sight and Eagle Eye were not removed.

-now only 4 dungeons from level 90-100
There are 4 dungeons from 90-99, and 4 more that open at level 100.

-client code for garrison cash shop functionality discovered, quickly removed along with tweet mentioning it from cory stockton
This never happened and such functionality is not planned, please don't spread false rumors.

-less raid content at launch than any expansion
False. The first tier of Warlords raiding contains 17 bosses.

-less dungeons than cataclysm had in PATCHES
False. Cataclysm added 3 brand new dungeons in 4.3, and 2 updated dungeons in 4.2. Warlords is launching with 7 new dungeons and 1 updated dungeon.

-no flying
True, at least at launch.

-story is a barely canon side timeline alternate dimension just to give another enemy to fight while trying to lure in veterans with nostalgia and a 'veterans first!" beta access program
Story opinions are subjective, but I’m sorry to hear you’re not as excited about it as we are. We've had tons of requests over the years for veteran perks.

-almost all CC removed in pvp. totally removed in pve
False and completely false.

-adding healing and tanking npcs in quests
I don't know what this is referring to. Maybe the occasional quests where you rescue someone and they help you fight for a brief time? Is that a bad thing?

-Heirloom and tabard storage tab just cut until "later"
True, though they haven’t been cut, merely delayed.

-replacing quests with "dynamic, interactive world experiences" that appear once and when you do them disappear leaving huge swathes of zones empty.
Questing hasn't been "replaced", and the "appear once and then disappear" bit is just false. Maybe you’ve just encountered an unfinished zone in Beta?

-new models have a single face and the cosmetic choices in almost every model but undead simply adds a new texture to said single face.
False. Have you seen our recent ArtCraft on the topic?

-homogenized healing to the point that its all just different colours now
False, but if you have specific feedback on why you feel that way, we'd love to hear it.

-guild levleing removed
True. We think this is a good thing.

-talents auto fill per spec to avoid confusion.
False and I have no idea why you'd think this was the case.

-80% of announcements from blizzcon for the expansion are confirmed cut or extremely truncated in some way.
We've made some cuts since Blizzcon, yes, but not nearly that many. We try to be as open as possible about what we’re dreaming up when we first announce an expansion, but a lot of things change and evolve from those basic concepts as development ramps up.

Regarding Twitter: it's a medium we're still kind of trying to figure out how to utilize most effectively. It's an extremely powerful way to talk to and engage with the community, but it's not great for everything, and we've certainly made some missteps. We're learning, though. 

This feedback is what really discourages me about the direction WoD is heading. "Story opinions are subjective" is not a helpful thing to tell players who are dissatisfied with the way you're telling a story. It more or less brushes them off and tells them that their opinions are worth less than other players.
Definitely not my intention, and I apologize for being unclear if you've taken it that way. I only called it subjective because, while I would call it false, opinions don't really lend themselves well to true/false answers. I'm excited about the WoD storyline, but that may not be the case for everyone and feedback on why you're not is very useful!

But really, it's indicative of an even larger problem: you say you like feedback, but you don't respond to it unless it's positive. When something is brought up that the playerbase doesn't like, you don't talk about it and then sit back and wait for us to accept it.

It's like what you want to say is "we love feedback, but only if it validates our current ideas about where we'd like to go."
One extremely important thing I want to get across here: when we're not talking about something publicly, that means we're talking about it internally. We're discussing the feedback and trying to determine what, if any, action needs to be taken. And until we have a solid answer, we don't want to tease people with a "we read this, but don't have anything to share just yet" response. Aside from the fact that it would slow us down dramatically we read a LOT of feedback every day, we just don't think a non-answer is a great one.

That said, we're always aiming to improve how we communicate, and definitely get the message that we can do better. We'll keep aiming to improve.

Targeted Feedback Request: Quest Bottlenecks
Beta is a crucial time for players to make their voices heard and give feedback to help make Warcraft the best game possible. While all constructive feedback is appreciated, one specific type of feedback that is uniquely valuable to us are examples of things that slow you down while questing out in the world: there's a lot of words to describe these types of situations, but perhaps the best word is "bottlenecks". 

Bottlenecks are basically the term we use to describe situations that stop players from questing at their normal pace. Players tend to progress through zones and quests at different rates, but if a quest target object, drop rate, or mob spawning rate is too rare, it can really slow players down. The fastest players will run into this first, and they might get through without too much of a reduction in their speed, but just like a traffic jam on a highway more and more people will pileup behind them.

This type of testing is super important for you folks to look for while leveling through zones in the beta. While my Quality Assurance QA team works to find and report issues like this in our testing, we're not able to easily replicate the large numbers of players hitting quests and zones at the same time.

In an effort to keep things organized, I've made one thread for each Draenor Questing zone. Please click on the appropriate link below and post in that thread with any examples of situations where you were slowed down by questing due to a bottleneck of some kind.

Beta EU Character Copy
EU character copies are coming. We're hoping to have them functional in the next major build.

To give a little insight: the beta realms are located in one of our North American datacenters. European characters are, obviously, located in European datacenters. For a number of obscure technical reasons, getting those datacenters to securely communicate with each other to transfer character data has been a much larger challenge than we expected.

We think we've got it solved, though, so fingers crossed you should be able to copy your characters soon! Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/329331-when-will-be-eu-character-copy/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13661596077?page=1#10

Stat Squish Status
Just a quick update here: all old world content should now be properly scaled. 

If you want, go on some transmog runs, go do old content like you do on live, etc. In general, everything should be similar or easier than it used to be. Please report any issues you encounter here.

Known problems:
Damage reflect effects like Reliquary's Aura of Desire will cause excessive backlash damage. Boss fights that rely on healing NPCs e.g. Valithria, Sinestra will be very difficult to complete due to the bonus vs. lower-level targets not applying to healing. 

These two problems should both be fixed next build. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/317916-stat-squish-status/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13019692478?page=1#2

Whichever dev thought giving Hunter/MagesRogue huge raid utility while taking away Tranq/HTT/Devo/etc from hybirds is making a mistake. #WoD
Do you disagree with the reasoning, or the strength of the relevant cooldowns? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492740713797275648
I think it is neutering hybrids too much. Example:Why bring a moonkin over another pure if they are even remotely on par w/ dmg?

Roar/HotW/Vortex isnt in the same ballpark as Smokebomb, Raid raid movement, Amp Magic, etc.
[Roar+NV/HotW+Vortex/Typhoon] vs. [Smoke Bomb] seems like a fair choice to us. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492745079140790272
Roar/Vortex/Typhoon are extremely situationaleg AE DeathGrip. Amp Magic/Smokebomb are usedrequired on almost every fight.
NV is useful in every single encounter. Roar is useful in 90+% of encounters. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492748241167843328
You think NV is going to be as strong as Amp Magic? I don't think it will be.
Depends on what you stack it with. NV plus Ysera's Gift, or the constant healing of Dream of Cenarius... It adds up. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492750580654174208
Small heals dont have the same weight as bulk heals in most situations. I just feel hybrid cds should be stronger.

So how do we math out on the fly just what sort of procs are needed to eat the debuff and make it worth the cast?
It may sound complex from that description, but there's no "on the fly" math needed, generally. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492534747537502208
Either it's better than Soul Fire damage numbers make that obvious, 0 or 1 stacks, or it's not only use for burst Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492534986319208449

PvP
will Ashran have destructable structures WG-style?still waiting for that invite, btw xDD
We explored some ideas with destructibles but decided against it. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/492409016388055041
I'm curious: What steered you away from destructibles?
It wasn't the gameplay we were going for. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/492448749806190593

will skirmishes only be implemented at max level? Pls revive 70 arena
No they'll be at all levels, but rated arena will only be at max level. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/492752999056293888

Can you share or hint anything about plans for S15 closure or balance tweaks? Anything you can will go a long way for arena players
Looking into exploits but no balance changes planned. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/492700663474692096
What about S15 closure? it's been extension of Grevious and feels like it has been a 50 week season since virtually nothing changed
Nothing to share about the end of season 15 but there won't be another season before Warlords. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/492711633949425664
Holinka last question.. Not a single person likes the Prideful Serpent. Would you ask the Devs to do a color swap for us? Please?
There are no plans to change the look of the S15 mount. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/492753188227805184

Will Elite PVP gear models be obtainable with honor in seasons after it's current?
Probably not. We'll have to discuss options there. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/492777965529219072

Lore
With so many portals in WoD's story, why don't the Iron Horde just use them to invade Azeroth without the Dark Portal?
They don't have Khadgar. And after the Tanaan intro, they don't have Gul'dan either. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/492722474635640833

How hard lore wise is it to open a portal from Azeroth to Draenor post expansion launch?
Lore-wise, extremely hard! For gameplay, there are a few in-game. Khadgar mentions how difficult it is. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/492723310044532736

Is there any in-game lore behind "Claws of Shirvallah"? And if so are these "renegades" inherently evil?
Almost no in-game lore. What do you guys think? Should we create a faction of crazy cat people? DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/492723513954816000

Beyond The Dark Portal, Turalyon and co went to Blade's Edge MountainsBEM. In WoD BEM's don't exist to my knowledge. Wut?
Blade's Edge was formed when parts of Frostfire crashed into the main continental plate when Draenor exploded. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/492722160192864257
But this was before the explosion, correct me if I'm wrong. 
Oh I see what you mean. Same area. You can see a hint of Blade's Edge in the rocks of Frostfire. We just didn't use the name. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/492724427964956673

Garrisons
Does the Choice Between Lumbermill & Fighting Arena in Gorgrond Effect which quests you get? Ty
Yes. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/492146739906744321
