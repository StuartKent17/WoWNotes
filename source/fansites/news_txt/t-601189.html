Tigole made multiple posts on Elitistjerks forums (http://elitistjerks.com/forums.php) concerning the elixir changes.<br>
<br>
<br>
--Flask powers have been GREATLY reduced.<br>
--Reagent costs for flasks have been ****GREATLY**** reduced.<br>
--Flasks take up both your offenseive AND defensive elixir slots. 1 Flask or 2 elixirs -- you choose.<br>
--Raid DPS has gone up (Glancing Blow and Class Changes)<br>
--Encounters where DPS was not a &quot;flasking factor&quot; (i.e. tuned around the HP flasks, elixir of mastery, defense etc). will be retuned.<br>

Raiders will have access to easy-to-access flasks in SSC, TK, Hyjal and Black Temple. Dungeon goers will have easy access to potions in Coilfang and TK 5-mans.<br>
<br>
For example, 1 Coilfang Armament = 1 super mana potion (zone specific) in the coilfangs.<br>
