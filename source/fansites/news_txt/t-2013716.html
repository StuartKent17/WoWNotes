Character Boost and Class Trials<br>
Legion adds a Class Trial system that allows you to test out a character before deciding if you want to use a character boost on it. You can play through a short intro, the Broken Shore, and Artifact intro quest.<br>

<br>
Character Boost and Class Trials Available for Testing<br>
<br>
With the latest beta build, we&#x2019;ve enabled the level 100 Boost and Class Trials experiences for Legion.<br>
<br>
<br>
Boosting a character to level 100 will place you into a short starting experience before you join in the Broken Shore experience. Class Trials will allow players to try various characters at level 100 as a part of a limited tutorial experience within the Broken Shore and allows players to play beyond the tutorial portion to experience the class through to acquiring their Artifact weapon. The short tutorial experience will focus on teaching many of the class&#x2019; core abilities. Players can apply a boost token at any time to keep the character they used during the Class Trial.<br>
<br>
For both the Boost experience and Class Trials, players will start with a pre-defined specialization that can be changed at a later point in time. Please note that due to the Demon Hunter not being eligible for Boosting, it will not have a Class Trial associated with it. <br>
<br>
For the beta test, we&#x2019;ve adjusted the class trial restrictions so that players can use these characters for an extended duration.<br>

Brawler&apos;s Guild: Last Chance to Rumble...For Now<br>
Don&apos;t forget that the Brawler&apos;s Guild is going away in the Legion pre-expansion patch!<br>
With the patch coming to World of Warcraft before Legion, the organizers of the Brawler&#x2019;s Guild will be temporarily closing their doors and going on a much-needed vacation. This means that you only have a few more weeks to experience strutting into the ring and standing alone against some of the greatest challenges ever faced by the champions of Azeroth. This is your time submit your fight card and show the crowd what you&#x2019;re made of. Plan out your best strategies. You&#x2019;re going to need them.<br>

Beta Character Copy - Updated 6/17<br>
Character Copy is currently enabled on the Beta realms. Once you login to the Beta realms, click the Copy Character button located under the &quot;Template Character&quot; button. <br>
<br>
The characters from your retail account should show up here; selecting one of them and clicking &quot;Copy&quot; will copy over a version of that character to the Beta Environment. If your Character List doesn&apos;t copy, make sure you have the proper region select and click &quot;Copy Account Data&quot;. Since this system requires gathering data from your live characters, it&apos;s possible that characters might not display if they have not been accessed for some time.<br>
<br>
Over the course of testing it may be necessary to disable Character Copy with little to no warning; we&apos;ll try to provide updates but please be aware the system will not always be online.<br>
<br>
Character Copy is currently not working on Beta Leveling Realm 03; cause is unknown at this point in time.<br>

Blood of Sargeras<br>
You will also see Blood of Sargeras from Disenchanting Rare and Epic items in a future beta build, as well as an increase in the cadence and quantity of Blood of Sargeras from Crafting World Quests in the Broken Isles. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/414636-lets-talk-about-blood-of-sargeras-being-bop/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20745065368?page=21#414))<br>

PvP Stat Templates<br>
I&apos;ve mostly been testing warrior/rogue/DK, and when compared to out in the world, I lose nearly half my health when joining a BG but hit just as hard. Armor seems silly low. Sitting in Org, my warrior has 2361 armor, but only 590 in BGs. In my last BG, a lock said they only have like 450 armor.<br>
<br>
If stamina was doubled in the templates, and armor raised at least 3x, melee might not be so ridiculous. EG, if those 150k+ mortal strikes were brought down to 110k via more armor, and health pools were closer to 500k (as on live) than the current 220-250k health we see on PTR, it might not be so bad.<br>
This is helpful, thank you. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/414570-100-pvp-templates-need-more-stamina-and-armor/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20745186243?page=1#8))<br>

Frost Mage -- Legion Beta Feedback<br>
Thanks for all the feedback on Frozen Orb. There are some pretty significant changes coming next build that should address this (edit: as those of you watching the Q&amp;A stream with Watcher are hearing about just this moment, as it turns out). In particular, Frozen Orb will return to the role that it had in Warlords: a 60-second cooldown that you use for AoE or for a burst of Fingers procs, not a spell prompted by a rotational proc. We are adding a new single-target spell to fill the rotational role of interacting with the Brain Freeze proc.<br>
<br>
Note that the wording of Ice Floes was recently changed to specify &quot;cast time less than 10 seconds&quot;, to clarify that it&apos;s not intended to work with Ray of Frost. The gameplay of Ray of Frost is that it&apos;s a ramping damage burst that rewards you for anticipating when you can remain still for 10 seconds (or at least, 8 or 9 out of the next 10 seconds).<br>
<br>
This is nice to hear as far as concerns about Brain Freeze go, but I&apos;m still worried all of the current issues with Orb are going to maintain just now we&apos;ll only have to deal with them once a minute. Will patiently wait to get to play with the build before complaining or anything, but I hope the actual core issues with Orb are going to be addressed in addition to this change.<br>
<br>
We will also be bringing Frozen Orb&apos;s Fingers of Frost chance up, and making it no longer speed back up after the first time it slows down.
