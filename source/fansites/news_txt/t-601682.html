We won&apos;t see the argent dawn in Northrend ... Weird, there are tons of undead here. Who the hell could help killing them ?<br>
<br>
Tirion Fordring will reorder and lead the Silver Hand in Northrend ... with the help of [item=13262] ! Which means that the sword could perfectly not be available to players. Actually, according to screenshots from the Blizzcon found on the web, he&apos;s wielding it in Valgarde !!<br>
<br>
This would also confirm the huge hint &quot;We are considering going back to Naxx when we get to Northrend&quot; during the Raid &amp; Dungeon panel. <br>
