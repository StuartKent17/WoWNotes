Drysc explains why the old arena titles are being &quot;removed&quot; from characters. <br>
<br>
It was announced before season 1.<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t; however, believe that it was communicated as consistently as could have been possible. It has been posted multiple times, before season 1, and after, but if you were unaware then I apologize. It has been the intention the entire time to only allow the titles to be shown for the season after they&apos;re earned.<br>
<br>
I think as other information on how the seasons, teams, and actual arena formats and rankings were going to work were the more pertinent pieces of information (who cares what happens in six months!?), it was generally glossed over.<br>
<br>
You&apos;re able to display your performance from the previous season, so that when a player sees you they can have some recognition of your achievement. This doesn&apos;t transfer from season to season as we want players to be able to advance in the arenas, gain ranks, and ultimately improve themselves and then show that to others through the title.<br>
<br>
Season 1 gear available at the beginning of Season 3<br>
Reasonable to one person could be unreasonable to another. The honor system and arena system are fundamentally different, and their investment comparisons are offset by any number of factors. Capped out in honor points should allow you to get two or three pieces I believe.<br>
<br>
The battleground daily quests, and additional bonus honor being given for each battleground come 2.3 should definitely help.<br>
<br>
When season 3 begins. Patch 2.3 will be patching in the season 3 rewards, but may not mark the actual start of the season. We&apos;ll let everyone know at least a couple weeks before it&apos;s scheduled to start.<br>
<br>
Brewfest extension impossible<br>
Basically, they can&apos;t make the brewfest lasts longer because Hallow&apos;s End is starting on October 18th, and I&apos;m sure you all want the [Shiny shiny epics from the Headless Horseman] (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/headlessloot.jpg).<br>
We cannot extend it a few days in this case due to Hallow&apos;s End. That is not an option.<br>
<br>
You can still get a ram if you start Brewfest this instant and average 7 keg turn-ins a day. Once a day, 15-20 minutes of play a day, until the 16th. That is not a significant amount of time. Remember that we buffed ticket rewards from the dailies when the Dark Iron attack was removed.<br>
<br>
No brewfest tabard<br>
I don&apos;t think a lot of you were waiting for a brewfest tabard, but it&apos;s interesting to see how these things work, and how we might get &quot;new&quot; tabard in the future.<br>
If you&apos;ll notice, all tabard textures are symmetrical. It&apos;s just how they work. The Brewfest logo/icon/design is not. It would require completely new tabard tech to use the Brewfest icon. Hopefully that&apos;s something we can do in the future, allow a tabard texture to not be mirrored down the middle, but at current that&apos;s the limitation for how they&apos;re textured.<br>
<br>
2.3 Unofficial patch notes updated<br>
The (2.3) tag at the beginning of each news make this kind of thing easier, so here is the fifth (and pink !) update of the unofficial 2.3 notes). This pretty much includes all the 2.3 related news this week (Season 3, AV, and a few classes changes) and also the addition of known loots from Blizzcon to the Zul&apos;aman part. As usual the new/updated entries are moved on top of the category.<br>
General<br>
(5) A new caster meta gem will be added, maybe similar to the Relentless Earthstorm Diamond (but with caster stats). (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2215432644&amp;postId=22153039814&amp;sid=1#2))<br>
(5) The 33% spell damage bonus on +healing affects enchants, gems, and all the other items, however it doesn&apos;t include temporary buffs, some BC leveling greens with &quot;of the...&quot; stats, and some Zul&apos;Gurub items. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2200220468&amp;postId=22151822603&amp;sid=1#63))<br>
(4) Escape Artist has now a 1:45 minutes cooldown.<br>
(4) All Disarm immunity effects in the game were changed to 50% disarm duration reduction (non stacking).<br>
(3) Auction&apos;s duration have been changed to 12, 24 or 48 hours. Also deposit prices for all duration will be the same. <br>
(3) You can now ctrl+click recipes to get a preview of the crafted item in the dressing room.<br>
(3) All items of the auction house will be sorted server side, basically it means that when you&apos;ll try to sort a particular item by price, it will sort it through all page, not only the current one.<br>
Healing Reduction effects now affect all Drain spells and abilities (i.e. Mortal Strike will affect Drain Life) (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1778037077&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=4#66))<br>

New relics are added to support all talent trees in patch 2.3 for Shaman, Paladins and Druids.

<br>
<br>
<br>
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br>
(3) New daily quests are available in the Lower City for 5 man heroic and non-heroic dungeons (Once at a time, a bit like battlegroundw weekends, each day you will get quests for a different dungeons). The following non-heroic dungeons are concerned : Shattered Halls, Steamvault, Shadow Labyrinth, Black Morass, Botanica, Mechanar, and Arcatraz. All dungeons will get quests in Heroic mode. If you&apos;re getting the non-heroic and the heroic quest on the same day for the same dungeon, you can complete both by running it in heroic mode once. Non heroic quests will reward you with a Ethereum Prison Key (various reputation), gold, and reputation with the Consortium. Heroic quests will give you 2 Badges of Justice, gold, and reputation with the Consortium.<br>
(2) Mobs inside Sethekk Halls will now continue to award Lower City reputation all the way into Exalted. Previously they stopped giving reputation in non-heroic mode just before players hit revered.<br>
(2) The number of creatures that must be killed in the Karazhan Servants Quarters area before a miniboss spawns has been reduced.<br>
New Title - Champion of the Naaru: Awarded to those who complete the Tempest Keep attunement quest at level 70. (Won&apos;t be available anymore at lvl 80) (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1778014822&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=19#371))<br>
Heroic Badges drop from Zul&apos;aman and Karazhan bosses.<br>
The amount of items available from the Heroic Badges vendor has been considerably increased. <br>
New 10-Man Raid - Zul&apos;Aman!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Zul&apos;aman<br>
Loots preview : [item=35000], [item=35001], [item=35002]. <br>
Zul&apos;Aman will be a 10-person raid zone<br>
Zul&apos;Aman will be on a quicker reset than 7 days (some might call this &quot;casual&quot;)<br>
Zul&apos;Aman will be MORE difficult than Karazhan and drop better loot (some might call this hardcore)<br>
Zul&apos;Aman will feature 6 bosses and it&apos;s our goal that you can kill them all in one night -- perhaps 2-3 hour clear times (some might call this casual)<br>
Zul&apos;Aman will not have a key requirement. Nor will it have an attunement quest\ (some might call this casual)<br>
Zul&apos;Aman will have a VERY challenging timed quest for those who choose to participate in it. This *will be* hardcore and will be very rewarding. Players do not have to engage in the timed run (very similar to the Baron run in Stratholme)<br>
We&apos;re tuning the first boss in Zul&apos;Aman to require less raid coordination than some other raid bosses. He will still hit very hard so you&apos;ll need to be geared properly but it won&apos;t take 15 minutes to explain the fight. It will be a simple yet challenging fight. The other boss fights get more complex and challenging from there. If players want a basis of comparison, imagine the tuning of ZA started around Nightbane/Prince difficulty and ramped up from there.<br>

(3) New battleground rewards are available : boots, belts, and bracers. (Source (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=1016252341&amp;sid=2))<br>
(1) New daily quests for battlegrounds have been added, they&apos;re dedicated to one specific battleground each day, are available to players of all levels, and reward experience, gold, and honor (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2038113831&amp;sid=1))<br>
(2) Spells now cast for free before a Battleground begins<br>
(2) Spells now cast for free for 5 seconds after resurrecting at a Spirit Healer in Battlegrounds<br>
(2) Additional Honor is rewarded upon conclusion of Warsong Gulch, Arathi Basin, and Eye of the Storm <br>
Season 1 arena gear will be available from honor points vendor when the season 3 starts.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[size=3]Alterac Valley<br>
(5) Each team will have a starting reinforcement count. Reinforcements can be lost in significant amounts if a tower is destroyed or if Captain Galvangar or Belinda Stonehearth is killed. For each team member death, an additional reinforcement will be lost. On the death of General Drek&#x2019;Thar or Vanndar Stormpike, all reinforcements are lost and the team is defeated. At any point in time, if a team is reduced to zero reinforcements, the opposing team will win the battle. Defending your own teammates, towers, and key NPCs will be an important aspect of maintaining team resources and achieving victory in Alterac Valley.<br>
(5) Warlords and their general will be more closely linked in the next patch. Pulling one is a guarantee the other will come as well. Each team begins with four Warmasters. Destroying a tower will eliminate the associated Warmaster. Unlike the current game play, however, destroying the enemy tower will not add a Warmaster to your own side.<br>
(5) We will be changing the pace of the battle slightly with a reduction in the time needed to control a tower or graveyard. Where it currently takes five minutes to gain control, the time will be reduced to four minutes. The honor for capturing a tower will also be increased.<br>
(5) Currently, players can sometimes be sent to their starting tunnels far from the battlefront. This can often be an inconvenient location to respawn and more out of the way from the action than we would like, to correct this, players will instead respawn at a team-controlled graveyard. Should the team not have a graveyard under their control, they will respawn in the starting tunnel.<br>
(5) Players will only be awarded bonus honor during the battle for destroying enemy towers and slaying the enemy Captain. Once the battle is concluded, bonus honor will be awarded for intact towers, a surviving Captain, and for victory in battle. The bonus honor awarded should be similar to previous totals, but will reward players for taking more active roles in Alterac Valley toward defending or attacking key locations and NPCs.<br>
(5) We have reduced the number of elite NPCs in Stormpike and Frostwolf holds as well as sent all Commanders and Lieutenants out of Alterac Valley.<br>
