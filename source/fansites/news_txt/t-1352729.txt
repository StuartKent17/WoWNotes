Blue Tweets
Class Balance Discussion
For discussion: How to solve the problem that most class discussions happen in sequestered class forums, which tend to have an echo chamber? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374977820503465985
must ask whats good bout discussion? Just lots of opinons?maybe in game sticky so anyone can say what they likehate bout class
Discussions tend to dismantle weak arguments and let stronger ones rise to the top. Discussions are like lists + evolution. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375789098750836736
Doesn't stop many common opinions in the community that have been dismantled time and time again.
I agree with that, though I think that's a function of online discussion forums typically having rapid turnover. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376879907940220928

change the format. and both use formats which generate a lot of traction. Forums are becoming antiquated.
Videos take too long to watch esp with ads. I don't get the appeal. I like Reddit though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376879259265953792

..and that brings it back to my initial problem. The echo chamber argument is pretty weak....
I agree with Lhivera. The echo chamber effect resists debates and encourages brofisting. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374988120590020609
Sounds harsh and elitist, but their progress and experience tells the same story 95% of the time.
But aren't you essentially arguing that the players are usually right? That is by far not the case. They are right... sometimes. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375301421307936768

Arguments for a real problem and for a bogus problem will look very similar in a brofisting context.
Think of it from our POV, where there are always far more demands from players than the game really needs. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375300008917999616
Separating good arguments from bad is non-trivial, so seeing a healthy debate w/ many POVs can help us make that distinction. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375300274442604544

also enforces groupthink around "my class sucks".
And anyone who intrudes to disagree either "doesn't understand our issues" or is accused of trolling. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374989766439104512
I'll say it again: You will never get as good feedback as you will get from the class specific forums. Ever.
Not from where I sit. Now it's possible to have healthy debate in class forums, but I rarely see it, and I read a lot of forums. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375301051626172416

I think that would just move the echo chamber somewhere else. Vidcast discussion panels with top players/TCs.
It's interesting that panels and podcasts tend to invite dissenting opinions w/in reason. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374990694126845953
I think they understand that softly competitive structure yields more interesting & informed discussions. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374991817923502080
I disagree that it's the format - more the interaction. If there's more from blues I believe you'd see more healthy discussion
The problem is the developers themselves are very busy and can't afford to spend hours per day in forums. Twitter is fast. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375299064922771456

Why is the echo chamber a problem? Not trying to be sarcastic; trying to understand what alternate state is desired.
We're not saying there aren't class problems, but when everything is portrayed as a crisis, it's hard to know really needs fixing. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374987254814343168
The echo chamber effect can also cause thought leaders or eloquent posters to create mountains out of molehills. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374987069849731072
It's nice to get a "um your DPS is fine" dissenting opinion, but those "trolls" get chased out of class-specific threads. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374986958902009856
you're guilty of this sort over tweets. 'We like where xx is at'. Some weeks later hotfix or minor patch and buffs appear
That is ultimately the system working though. Sometimes players convince us a change is necessary. Other times data prove us wrong. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375298834999410688

Legitimate contributors are discouraged from posting because of toxic abusive posters. Remove problems, contributors return?
I used to subscribe to that more, but over moderation can also create fear and resentment. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374989132977557504
It's also something we can't enforce on websites other than our own, but conversations certainly take place there. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374989208873492480

Bold idea: remove class forums. No echo. "Answers/Advice For New Players" can be its own forum instead.
It's not strictly a "class subforum" problem. Even general forums spawn class-specific threads. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374988301255446528

And to be clear, I do think that blues should always be very careful when they decide to post in a class forum.
I don't personally post in class forums anymore or rarely anywhere. It caused more QQ than it solved IMO. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374987547690020864
Even today you see Why didn't we get posts / as many posts / as many substantial posts / more posts b/c our issues are worse? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374987778284462080

Reputation / Questing
I should clarify... levelling ONE char was fun. Levelling more in MoP was not.
That's fair criticism. We hoped that choices like Four Winds vs. Krasarang would help the second time around. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377207347505942530

I'm wondering, how do you guys consider MOP levelling? A success, failure / could be better? I find it rather boring.
We think it was probably a little slow overall. At launch, you did a bunch of quests and saw the XP bar grow only a little. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377204758127190016
We buffed the leveling speed a patch or two ago. It feels better now IMO. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377204815471730688

can we get option to show rep gain in quest dialog?
We explored this, but many quests offer rep for multiple factions like e.g. all Alliance cities and it was really spammy. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375303579998765058

So you'd rather people get burnt out on gearing, than actually participate because it's fun?
We find most players won't participate in any activity without motivation from rewards that improve power. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/379427333305675777
In fact the opposite can also be true: if we're not careful, players will engage in unfun things just for the power rewards. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/379427636377710593
You mean daily quests?
Or chain running Mechanar. Or farming Sunwell trash. The list goes on. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/379727121431552000

I hate to sound like an echo chamber, but dailies feeling required are why I'm not playing Mists.
I think your information might be fairly old. The new patch has virtually no dailies. It still has a lot to do. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/379724181484478466


Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
New GPUs from AMD are on the way, so if you are only upgrading your GPU it might be worth it to wait a month or two.

The current SSD prices http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/september/ssdgraph2.gif are stable, with most SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. RAM prices are continuing to climb. 

The Haswell CPUs from Intel are here http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1 and they run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&tag=mmochamp-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A or H90 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4OCWDE?ie=UTF8&tag=mmochamp-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00B4OCWDE. 

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx and Nvidia http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/290-Computer for any extra questions!
