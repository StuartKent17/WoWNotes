Class Balance Discussion
For discussion: How to solve the problem that most class discussions happen in sequestered class forums, which tend to have an echo chamber? Source 
must ask whats good bout discussion? Just lots of opinons?maybe in game sticky so anyone can say what they likehate bout class
Discussions tend to dismantle weak arguments and let stronger ones rise to the top. Discussions are like lists + evolution. Source 
Doesn't stop many common opinions in the community that have been dismantled time and time again.
I agree with that, though I think that's a function of online discussion forums typically having rapid turnover. Source 

change the format. and both use formats which generate a lot of traction. Forums are becoming antiquated.
Videos take too long to watch esp with ads. I don't get the appeal. I like Reddit though. Source 

..and that brings it back to my initial problem. The echo chamber argument is pretty weak....
I agree with Lhivera. The echo chamber effect resists debates and encourages brofisting. Source 
Sounds harsh and elitist, but their progress and experience tells the same story 95% of the time.
But aren't you essentially arguing that the players are usually right? That is by far not the case. They are right... sometimes. Source 

Arguments for a real problem and for a bogus problem will look very similar in a brofisting context.
Think of it from our POV, where there are always far more demands from players than the game really needs. Source 
Separating good arguments from bad is non-trivial, so seeing a healthy debate w/ many POVs can help us make that distinction. Source 

also enforces groupthink around "my class sucks".
And anyone who intrudes to disagree either "doesn't understand our issues" or is accused of trolling. Source 
I'll say it again: You will never get as good feedback as you will get from the class specific forums. Ever.
Not from where I sit. Now it's possible to have healthy debate in class forums, but I rarely see it, and I read a lot of forums. Source 

I think that would just move the echo chamber somewhere else. Vidcast discussion panels with top players/TCs.
It's interesting that panels and podcasts tend to invite dissenting opinions w/in reason. Source 
I think they understand that softly competitive structure yields more interesting & informed discussions. Source 
I disagree that it's the format - more the interaction. If there's more from blues I believe you'd see more healthy discussion
The problem is the developers themselves are very busy and can't afford to spend hours per day in forums. Twitter is fast. Source 

Why is the echo chamber a problem? Not trying to be sarcastic; trying to understand what alternate state is desired.
We're not saying there aren't class problems, but when everything is portrayed as a crisis, it's hard to know really needs fixing. Source 
The echo chamber effect can also cause thought leaders or eloquent posters to create mountains out of molehills. Source 
It's nice to get a "um your DPS is fine" dissenting opinion, but those "trolls" get chased out of class-specific threads. Source 
you're guilty of this sort over tweets. 'We like where xx is at'. Some weeks later hotfix or minor patch and buffs appear
That is ultimately the system working though. Sometimes players convince us a change is necessary. Other times data prove us wrong. Source 

Legitimate contributors are discouraged from posting because of toxic abusive posters. Remove problems, contributors return?
I used to subscribe to that more, but over moderation can also create fear and resentment. Source 
It's also something we can't enforce on websites other than our own, but conversations certainly take place there. Source 

Bold idea: remove class forums. No echo. "Answers/Advice For New Players" can be its own forum instead.
It's not strictly a "class subforum" problem. Even general forums spawn class-specific threads. Source 

And to be clear, I do think that blues should always be very careful when they decide to post in a class forum.
I don't personally post in class forums anymore or rarely anywhere. It caused more QQ than it solved IMO. Source 
Even today you see Why didn't we get posts / as many posts / as many substantial posts / more posts b/c our issues are worse? Source 

Reputation / Questing
I should clarify... levelling ONE char was fun. Levelling more in MoP was not.
That's fair criticism. We hoped that choices like Four Winds vs. Krasarang would help the second time around. Source 

I'm wondering, how do you guys consider MOP levelling? A success, failure / could be better? I find it rather boring.
We think it was probably a little slow overall. At launch, you did a bunch of quests and saw the XP bar grow only a little. Source 
We buffed the leveling speed a patch or two ago. It feels better now IMO. Source 

can we get option to show rep gain in quest dialog?
We explored this, but many quests offer rep for multiple factions like e.g. all Alliance cities and it was really spammy. Source 

So you'd rather people get burnt out on gearing, than actually participate because it's fun?
We find most players won't participate in any activity without motivation from rewards that improve power. Source 
In fact the opposite can also be true: if we're not careful, players will engage in unfun things just for the power rewards. Source 
You mean daily quests?
Or chain running Mechanar. Or farming Sunwell trash. The list goes on. Source 

I hate to sound like an echo chamber, but dailies feeling required are why I'm not playing Mists.
I think your information might be fairly old. The new patch has virtually no dailies. It still has a lot to do. Source 


Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud 
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud  will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
New GPUs from AMD are on the way, so if you are only upgrading your GPU it might be worth it to wait a month or two.

The current SSD prices  are stable, with most SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. RAM prices are continuing to climb. 

The Haswell CPUs from Intel are here  and they run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14  or H90  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions! If you are interested in Folding@home, take a look in our team's thread
