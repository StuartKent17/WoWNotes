Patch 4.1 Hotfixes - April 29
April 28-29

Classes

Some interrupts were still incorrectly missing targets. Wind Shear, Spell Lock, Counterspell, Mind Freeze, and hunter pet abilities Nether Shock and Serenity Dust should no longer miss.
Characters who mount up with a pet bar active should no longer lose control of the pet if they dismount while under the effects of any crowd control.

Divine Aegis will no longer produce a shield if the full heal that should cause it is absorbed by a death knight’s Necrotic Strike.


Dungeons & Raids

The Satchel of Exotic Mysteries given to the members of a class role eligible for Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms rewards now has an increased chance of containing a non-combat pet.


The Bastion of Twilight

The timing between Corrupted Adherent Summons and Cho'gall Fury is consistent with its behavior prior to 4.1.


Blackwing Descent

Maloriak no longer interrupts his own casts of Arcane Storm by moving mid-cast.
Nefarian will no longer stutter step toward his main target.


Zul’Aman

All non-elite creatures which respawn quickly no longer award loot, reputation, or experience.
Akil’zon will summon Amani Kidnappers less frequently, but their health has been increased.


Zul’Gurub

All non-elite creatures which respawn quickly no longer award loot, reputation, or experience.
Gurubashi Villagers and Gurubashi Refugees no longer drop epic loot.
Ohgan will no longer fail to target and kill Chained Spirits if he is stunned at certain times.

Guilds close to level 25 should correctly receive the realm-first achievement when applicable, regardless of whether or not contributing members recently transferred to the realm.


Items

Players are no longer able to purchase any of the city reputation satchels without having the required reputation.


Professions
Engineering

Nitro Boosts now do 80% of the engineer’s health in damage over 8 seconds when they fail due to a Rocket Fuel Leak, down from 120%.


Quests & Creatures

NPCs should be a little less talkative when interacted with. They were saying their lines on virtually every interaction buying, selling, etc..

Players should again be able to successfully complete the quest The Firelord.
