Warcraft Movie Marketing<br>
Duncan Jones (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/with_replies) recently talked a little bit more about the Warcraft movie and marketing it.<br>

<br>
So lets chat. Ive got a movie coming out next year; WARCRAFT. Its based on a computer game of the same name but its pretty unique. We&apos;re trying to work out how best to let people who don&apos;t play the game know that this is a film they&apos;ll genuinely want to see. You know as well as I do, game to film adaptions have a checkered past, but Im proud of this beast. It&apos;s unique. Its something special. (ManMadeMoon (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/563492124067237888))<br>
<br>
Tricky. Want to let the people who grew up with Warcraft know we are doing right by them &amp; welcome those who don&apos;t know it at all! (ManMadeMoon (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/563496059964387328))<br>
<br>
Well how far from the game does it lean? Is it a very loose adaptation or would fans find it rewarding on a different level?<br>
Definitely the latter. (ManMadeMoon (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/563494329453277184))<br>
<br>
Any worry long time Warcraft fans will be disappointed by any changes made to the movie?<br>
I don&apos;t think so... But more importantly, Chris Metzen and the gang have worked with us right from the start. (ManMadeMoon (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/563576100740022273))<br>
<br>
definitely for female audiences like me, not into games, don&apos;t even suggest it&apos;s a video game.<br>
Agreed. Do you think the title itself would be held against it though? &quot;Warcraft?&quot; (ManMadeMoon (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/563494556797124612))<br>
<br>
Can you say anything about how much is live action vs CGI?<br>
I would say that we fit somewhere between Planet of the Apes, Fellowship of the Ring and Avatar. (ManMadeMoon (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/563496576119631872))<br>
<br>
So many action films these days too, if trailers are just mash ups of attacking I imagine it might feel just like any another<br>
Agreed. (ManMadeMoon (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/563499074305794048))<br>
<br>
I take it you&apos;re looking for the best way to convey the uniqueness and specialness w/o giving the game away, then?<br>
Yes. But there is a central conceit we&apos;re sharing right from the start. Its a story told from two sides. (ManMadeMoon (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/563502641938845696))<br>
<br>
Thought Guardians of the Galaxy trailer did a great job telling non-sci-fi fans it was a film for them too. Good guiding star.<br>
deffo worth a relook at how they did it. (ManMadeMoon (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/563502837481480192))<br>
<br>
As a non-player, I wouldn&apos;t want to feel alienated from plot by trailers assuming audience knowledge of warcraft<br>
VERY sensible. (ManMadeMoon (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/563517215475896320))<br>

Patch 6.0.3 Hotfixes - February 9<br>
World Event: Love is in the Air<br>
<br>
Crushing the Crown: Fixed an issue where the Crown Chemical Company Wagon in Darkshore was not granting quest completion credit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br>
<br>
Blackrock Foundry<br>
<br>
Gruul<br>
<br>
Gronnling Laborer&apos;s Gronnling Smash ability now deals less damage.<br>
Reduced the damage that Gruul&#x2019;s Inferno Strike deals to 10-player raid groups on Normal and Heroic difficulties, but increased the rate at which damage scales with raid size. Larger raid groups should find the damage relatively unchanged; smaller groups will find that the ability now deals less damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Blast Furnace<br>
<br>
There&apos;s now a berserk timer for the encounter at the 13 minute mark.<br>
<br>
<br>
Iron Maidens<br>
<br>
Admiral Gar&apos;an&apos;s Penetrating Shot no longer targets players who are riding a loading chain.<br>
Fixed a situation where Tricks of the Trade (Rogue) or Misdirection (Hunter) could cause the Deckhands to go into evade mode.<br>
<br>
<br>
Blackhand<br>
<br>
[Requires a realm restart] Beginning with the new raid timer, Blackhand will consistently drop universal set tokens at the same consistent rates as other bosses in Blackrock Foundry.<br>
If the Siegemaker&apos;s Fixated target dies, it should now Fixate on the closest target.<br>
Cast time for Iron Soldier&apos;s Explosive Rounds ability should now be scaling smoothly with raid size and should no longer have breakpoints where the damage ramps up more than intended at 16 and 26 players.<br>
In Stage Two, Blackhand now casts Marked for Death every 16 seconds (up from 15 seconds).<br>
Players no longer take falling damage upon landing after receiving Blackhand&apos;s Massive Shattering Smash.<br>
In Stage Three, Blackhand&apos;s Attach Slag Bombs ability now prefers players that are not affected by the Impaled debuff.<br>
<br>
<br>
Battleground and Arenas<br>
<br>
Druid&apos;s Starfall and Sunfall no longer targets players that are capturing a PvP point in Arathi Basin, Battle for Gilneas, and Eye of the Storm.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bug Fixes<br>
<br>
Alliance characters that complete the Primal Combatant achievement are no longer being told to go to Orgrimmar to receive a reward.<br>

What more feedback could you possibly need? It was buffed by 50%. Add -25% reduced healing in pvp. Keep it instant. Done.<br>
In 6.1, Saving Grace is 50% better and instant. It is then nerfed by 33% in PvP. Same healing + instant. Simply better than 6.0. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/560975926985388032))<br>
After testing, 54k on Live, 40ish on PTR. Looks like it is increased by 50% then reduced by 50%, not 33%.<br>
check next build. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/561008727638421504))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
Coming in Patch 6.1: Elemental Rune (http://www.wowdb.com/items/115510-elemental-rune) collected for the &apos;Might of the Elemental Lords (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/36013-might-of-the-elemental-lords)&apos; quest will stack to 999. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/560970950103924736))<br>
<br>
Concerned the new Piccolo is going to be another annoying item that interrupts eating/drinking, confirm it won&apos;t?<br>
We&apos;ve changed the way the item works specifically to avoid that. It will not interrupt eating or drinking. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/561248961755746304))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
stupid question: does the ice nova change mean that it won&apos;t DR with poly anymore?<br>
Correct (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/561287410785345537))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
I&apos;m a raid leader, and I built a Mage Tower to help my raid team get to raid. Did I just waste my gold? They can&apos;t use it?<br>
Your friends will be able to use your Mage Tower / Spirit Lodge portals in patch 6.1! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/561238720691437568))<br>
<br>
Does the patch note change wrt amulets/rings for tanks/healers apply to raids or just quests in Nagrand + Garrison missions?<br>
Yes, it applies to all Garrison mission tokens, as well as raids and dungeons. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/561307124844597249))<br>
