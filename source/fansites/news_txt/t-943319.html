Since Paragon (http://www.paragon.fi/) still holds the only recorded kill of Ragnaros in heroic mode, it is probably worth reporting that they also killed the 10-Man version as well. Congratulations to them, see their statement below!<br>
<br>
After a very deserving break from a tight raiding schedule that we kept for the past few weeks, we went back in to the Firelands. The goal was pretty simple: Check out the fights on 10-man heroic to gauge their relative difficulty compared to 25-mans. There&apos;s been so much discussion on various community sites about this topic, saying that 10-mans are &quot;overtuned&quot; and near unkillable and whatnot. Others saying it&apos;s the other way around.<br>
<br>
After a quick clear of the filler bosses yesterday, we decided to go all out on Ragnaros today. We begun importing our 25-man tactics and had multiple very silly wipes. Once we realized we could just ditch the overly complicated tactics, we made several P4 wipes. Soon afterwards we were able to slay him and get the world first 10-man Ragnaros Heroic kill as well.<br>
<br>
All in all, Ragnaros on the 10-man Heroic mode took 32 wipes in total with everything (such as multiple disconnects) included.<br>

This is a great time to tame the wild and noble Cenarion Hatchling!

This support will enable the Red Cross to provide shelter, food, emotional support, and other assistance to victims of this disaster.<br>

Feral performance in PvE<br>
That said, we&apos;re happy with Feral performance in PvE overall. It we were to nerf Predatory Swiftness, it&apos;d have a minor impact on PvE. Unheeded Warning is both a PvE and PvP problem. The particular mechanics of the trinket keep it disproportionately powerful for Feral druids. Nerfing Berserk would have PvE ramifications, but we&apos;ll take steps overall to make sure your dps doesn&#x2019;t drop in PvE. We do everything we can to ensure we&apos;re considering all aspects of gameplay when approaching class balance.

Feral stealth isn&apos;t superior to Rogue&apos;s<br>
Given that they are exactly the same mechanically, this shouldn&apos;t be the case. This has been a particularly pervasive myth that I&apos;d like to lay to rest. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/187231/feral-vs-rogue) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2878489481?page=1#2))<br>
<br>
The fact that this shouldn&apos;t be the case, doesn&apos;t mean it isn&apos;t. Also, saying its a myth, or believing it must be, does not make it so.<br>
You&apos;re correct. Merely saying something isn&apos;t so, doesn&apos;t mean a thing.<br>
<br>
Knowing that they&apos;re the same ability used by different classes, and knowing that this exact issue has been tested, repeatedly, in response to claims otherwise, does.

<br>
Feral Instinct<br>
This is correct, choosing the Feral spec and gaining Feral Instinct merely brings Feral spec Stealth into line with Rogue baseline stealth (whose talents have been rolled into the ability).
