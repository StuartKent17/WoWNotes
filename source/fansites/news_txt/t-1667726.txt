Blue Tweets
Character / Items
This expansion made inventory management worse. Toy box was one step forward and all the new stuff 5 steps back.
What new stuff are you having trouble fitting? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/546044237452546048

PvE
had a SoO lockout which I joined mid run, cleared to Garrosh. after leaving it said the first 3 bosses were available + Garrosh. few weeks later, extending the lockout, I kill Immerseus and now I have a lockout with only Immerseus dead. I suppose it has to do with lockouts being nothing more than loot locks nowadays, either way I think choosing to extend should mean you are deliberately choosing to get loot locked to these bosses you don't want to re-kill.
Agreed - I think we have some work to do there to clean up the system. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/545978371474083840

Lore
big lore moment in highmaul with cho'gall restricted to mythic only. feel annoyed by this, shouldn't better items be enough?
Not sure it qualifies as a 'big lore moment.' It's a neat fight, though! DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/546020149229146112

Out of curiosity, how common is it for a Draenei to be named Exarch? Just did the quest chain with Yrel and found it interesting!
At this time in Draenor there were exactly five Exarchs, "The Hand of the Prophet." At least, they start with five... DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/546020766936883200

Garrisons
What ever happened to, followers would get a rare mission to run old raids to sometimes bring back transmog gear?
Felt strange having them run old raids when they're supposed to be defending Draenor. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/545753136481062912

With the legendary follower. Is it a character that we already know of or is it an entirely new character?
I'm not sure that a brand new character would feel legendary to people. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/545758419135655936

I'm really surprised our Garrisons didn't get decorated for the holidays.
Def. would have been nice to have, it was on our wishlist to let you choose the holiday decoration set any time of year. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/546043560739364864

Misc
also I get the feeling that after @WarcraftDevs showed up you guys just don't talk anymore, which is sad 
With the release of WoD, there's a bit less to discuss atm I am thinking of making a crock pot of spiced cider. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/546043981432246272
