A new PTR build was deployed during the night, there wasn&apos;t any change to player skills / talents or achievements, only a lot of bug fixes. <br>
<br>
<br>
Patch 3.2 - Where can I get Epic Gems?<br>
The patch will probably hit the live servers very soon and a lot of people ask me the same question : Where can I get the Epic Gems? It shouldn&apos;t be hard to answer that, currently there are 4 ways to get them :<br>
<br>
Jewelcrafting / Prospecting<br>
You can find epic gems by prospecting Titanium Ore (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36910/titanium-ore/), it&apos;s probably not the best way to get it because Titanium is already fairly expensive but if you need as many gems as possible and don&apos;t want to wait, go for it. Prospecting Titanium will give you an epic gem 25~30% of the time, the droprate for rare gems seems to be the same, and you will always get an uncommon gem. If you&apos;re lucky enough you can even get 2 epics on the same prospect. <br>
<br>
Note: You will also get Titanium Powder (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46849/titanium-powder/) 60% of the time, you can exchange 10 of them for a Dalaran Jewelcrafter&apos;s Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/41596/dalaran-jewelcrafters-token/) and get your new recipes even faster. <br>
<br>
Alchemy<br>
New transmutations are available for these gems. (20 Hours cooldown)<br>
<br>
Transmute: Ametrine (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66658/transmute-ametrine/)<br>
Transmute: Cardinal Ruby (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66659/transmute-cardinal-ruby/)<br>
Transmute: Dreadstone (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66662/transmute-dreadstone/)<br>
Transmute: Eye of Zul (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66664/transmute-eye-of-zul/)<br>
Transmute: King&apos;s Amber (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66660/transmute-kings-amber/)<br>
Transmute: Majestic Zircon (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66663/transmute-majestic-zircon/)<br>
<br>
PvE - Emblems of Heroism<br>
You can buy any of the epic gems for Emblem of Heroism (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40752/emblem-of-heroism/). These emblems do not drop anymore in 3.2 and are replaced by Emblems of Conquest in heroic instances / raids dungeons but you can still exchange higher tier emblems. (Emblem of Conquest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/45624/emblem-of-conquest/) -&gt; Emblem of Valor (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40753/emblem-of-valor/) &gt; Emblem of Heroism (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40752/emblem-of-heroism/).<br>
