Alpha Realm Maintenance - 12/1/15
Greetings Friends and Testers! 

The Alpha realms have been shut down for maintenance in order to deploy a new build. We are currently estimating realms to be offline for the remainder of the day, and returning sometime on Wednesday. Updates will be provided tomorrow once we have a better ETA.

I'll be leaving this thread open for general discussion as long as people remain civil and follow forum rules.

Deploying a new build right before finals week? Cruel and unusual punishment. I can't wait though, the failure will be extremely fun.

You should be able to fit all the studying in today right?

Draenor Perks in Legion
The Draenor Perks will be retiring in Legion. However, many of their effects will be "baked in" to the baseline abilities. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

ShS used to be our 41 and now you're giving it to assassination only? Uh....
Our intention is for Subtlety to be *better* at Shadowstep than the other specs, due to having a better version of it. WarcraftDevs 
If Shadowstrike isn't meeting that intention, we'll iterate as needed until we reach that goal. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
Can you confirm that the legendary effects will, or will not, work in rated/non-rated PvP?
Legendary effects will not work in instanced PvP like Battlegrounds or Arenas. They *will* work in World PvP. WarcraftDevs 

are Artifact talents working in pvp? Cause so far with talents/pvp looked good. Artifact is looking potentially game breaking 
Artifact traits will work in all PvP situations. If a particular trait is problematic, we will address it. WarcraftDevs 

hey what level do we get the honor levels? and what would be the max honor level at level 20? just so i can get a grasp on this
The Honor system and PvP talents are only for max level players. For #Legion, that's 110. WarcraftDevs
