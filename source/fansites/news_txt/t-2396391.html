You can see what class abilities are on the GCD in Battle for Azeroth on the WoWDB beta site (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities?filter-on-gcd=1).<br>
Yeah, we agree that having racials on the GCD isn&apos;t feeling great. Having to press multiple buttons in a row that don&apos;t do anything but increase throughput isn&apos;t particularly engaging. While we can resolve that issue within the context of a spec&apos;s toolkit, racials (as well as on-use trinkets) add an extra layer on top of that. So, in an upcoming beta build (likely next week), we&apos;ll be taking racials and on-use trinkets back off of the GCD.</div></div>
