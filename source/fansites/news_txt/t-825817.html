<br>
Update - Meta Gems Changes<br>
Meta gems with the Chaotic and Relentless prefixes now have a requirement of 3 red gems.<br>
Added new meta gems: Agile Shadowspirit Diamond (Agility/3% critical damage), Reverberating Shadowspirit Diamond (Strength/3% critical damage), and Burning Shadowspirit Diamond (Intellect/3% critical damage). These new recipes are unbound and can drop from any Cataclysm creature. The new meta gems have a requirement of 3 red gems equipped.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Patch 4.0.6 Patch Notes (PTR)<br>
Official patch notes have been released and seems to be from a build older than the one on PTR. Also, official changes are always better than datamined changes so there you go!<br>
General<br>
<br>
Many tooltips have been updated to reflect any changes made via recent hotfixes.<br>
The guild reward Armadillo Pup now requires revered faction instead of exalted.<br>
<br>

The Battleground Demolisher no longer has two additional seats and now only has room for the driver.<br>
A PvP duration flag has been added to Battleground Demolishers. This should make it so crowd control effects cast on unmanned demolishers does not last an extended amount of time.<br>
