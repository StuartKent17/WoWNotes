The PTRs servers are still mostly down and at this point I&apos;m not really sure if we will see anything happen today. Well, at least we have a couple of screenshots from the instance, Thanks to NicoNero on the forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/raids-dungeons/screenshots-from-inside-ruby-sanctum/)!<br>

DK Rotations in Cataclysm (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702153222/dks-downtime-and-cataclysm/))<br>
The point is not that we want a DK to hit a yellow attack then sit around waiting until they can do something fun again.<br>
<br>
The point is that we have no room to add anything to the DK rotation. If we wanted to add &quot;clearcasting&quot; style procs or cooldowns finishing sooner or runes regenerating sooner, we can&apos;t really do that because the DK doesn&apos;t have room in a very tight rotation to use those abilities. If you try and use your GCD on anything else, then the whole rotation collapses because then your runes aren&apos;t coming back at the right time or your diseases are expiring or whatever.<br>
<br>
Imagine 1-4 are rotational abilities like Icy Touch and Blood Strike and F = &quot;fun thing&quot;.<br>
<br>
DK rotation today: 1233331233334123333123333<br>
DK rotation in Cataclysm: 123333-F-12-F-33334123333-F- <br>
