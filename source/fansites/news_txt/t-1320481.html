As heal I hate this &quot;nonstop AOE heal spam&quot; playstyle for example.<br>
We do think AE heal spam has gotten out of control again. The healer tookit lacks depth when single target heals are ignored. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356130747364544513))<br>
It&apos;s challenging because every time we nerf AEs, rather than going to single-target heals, healers just feel too weak to heal. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356130907784097792))<br>
<br>
Stop giving abilities 2charges, it&apos;s a dumb system..<br>
Why do you think so? We like the system since it lets you hold a CD rather than using it ASAP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355448354823618560))<br>

are you concerned people are playing specs that sim the highest spa and not the specs they enjoy the most?<br>
Yes. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s healthy for the game but it&apos;s a hard mentality to fight. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352095864732397570))<br>
For almost all of us, 1% more DPS is not the difference between success or failure. Playing well is. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352096047851511808))<br>
For almost all of us, the top 100 on Raidbots is not a reflection of what we can do on an encounter. Even more so for sims. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352096218630979586))<br>
<br>
in the world of bring the player not the class shouldn&apos;t http://t.co/s32qQttF4q be equivalent to lust and not weaker?<br>
If the goal was that you had all buffs regardless of comp then we&apos;d just give them all passively. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350640762343538689))<br>
Isn&apos;t this raid buff thing mostly there to shit on 10m raids? 25s get them all by accident.<br>
Buffs are there to make you feel stronger in a group and to encourage some level of raid diversity. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350659198029271042))<br>
I just don&apos;t see why mark fort and now hero, which we have like 3 copies of each, are handed out, but we gotta struggle.<br>
The original idea with Mark and Fort was that tank survivability is balanced around having those. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350821847111184384))<br>
It&apos;s harder to tell a tank to survive better the way you can usually coax a little more from DPS. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350821999729328128))<br>
But in MoP I&apos;m not sure the distinction is that relevant anymore. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350822080515817472))<br>

Don&apos;t you think that cooldowns/trinkets are too high? a 250k Chaos Bolt normal going to 900k with procs, isn&apos;t that too much?<br>
We do worry that the synergistic effects of lining up CDs with trinkets has grown too large. Lining up shouldn&apos;t trump everything. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350707058494021632))<br>
Personally I think there are just too many cooldowns+trinkets. I&apos;d rather have one big cooldown I use than 4 I have to line up<br>
Yeah, it&apos;s a cause of button bloat for sure. Does Ret need AW and GoAK? Does Fury need Skull Banner and Recklessness? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350716946049798144))<br>

Removing SS as a talent will cripple BM and SV in PvP, forcing hunters into MM if they want to be able to compete in PvP<br>
So BM for example can have a trinket or a silence. Seems fair. You really need both? When does anyone get a chance to counter? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352102839587315712))<br>
you do realize that you gave hunter trinket and silence in the first place right? youre arguing with yourself now<br>
Right. That&apos;s why we made the change. The original 5.0 talent design was crazy generous to BM PvP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355778604870795264))<br>
will we have some dmg buff on kill command in 5.4 ? and you guys think of baking widow venom in serpent sting ?<br>
Long term, we agree Widow Venom needs some work. Short term not thrilled with the idea of e.g. Serpent Spread + Widow Venom. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356124251746607104))<br>
<br>
Why is Snake Trap still in the game? It does like 300 dps on level 90. It&apos;s completely useless.<br>
We agree it needs a better niche. Reluctant to yank it since it has a unique kit vs. the 200 spells in the game named Frost X. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356120684612681728))<br>
<br>
The tooltip says &quot;preventing any spell in that school from being cast for 3 sec&quot; so yes.<br>
You can also use Silencing Shot preemptively to stop the cast, while Counter Shot has to land during the cast. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355775236140056577))<br>
<br>
Talking with several hunters, agreement that Readiness going away is fine if other spells are adjusted as well.<br>
We&apos;re thinking 2 charges on Deterrence and Disengage, then other buffs to things like Kill Command. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355446169616392193))<br>
Wouldn&apos;t that be a big buff with the talented 1min Deter? 1min and 5min Deter vs both are up in 2mins?<br>
Charges just gives them what they have today with Readiness, though IIRC the base CDS are longer. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355482459929968640))<br>

Have you seen this post detailing some concerns about hunters? http://t.co/NlAMMnOwjPIt has some nice points.<br>
We are pretty happy with raid utility for all specs. Every class asks for more to guarantee a raid spot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350663595475996674))<br>
What utility do hunters offer in 25m or even well organized 10m that another class or two don&apos;t already bring?<br>
That is true of everyone but warlocks, who probably bring too much. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352113914055634944))<br>
<br>
Stampede was never intended to provide utility. It&apos;s a DPS cooldown. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350662851041570817))<br>
It&apos;s now a 20 second DOT on a 5 minute CD that is worth 1% of our total damage. Least compelling CD in the game?<br>
Do keep in mind that total damage and damage per second both have different benefits. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350701768939814912))<br>
Do keep in mind that it is our 87 ability, and it is exactly like Dire Beast. &quot;Insulting&quot; is the word.<br>

Because we like huge gear jumps between tiers. Allows us to challenge the best guilds and those that come later (with more gear). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350824836391645185))<br>

WW needs something besides dps to offer. Every other melee has a raid cooldown, major raid healing or both. WW has neither.<br>
The utility arms race won&apos;t end well. Someone will always have the best and others will still want more to compete. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356129740622532609))<br>

The intent isn&apos;t to nerf WW overall -- we&apos;re not finished yet. It will end up with Rune just being good instead of crazy OP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355778297805815808))<br>

You need to understand LoD is too weak and you tuned SoO encounters to favor hots(EF). On no boss so far would LoD outdo EF.<br>
Paladins survived for years without hots. We don&apos;t buy that they are utterly dependent on a talent that is like a year old. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356128545468198914))<br>
<br>
(continued) we do it because the alternative doesn&apos;t exist. When u floored Holy Radiance u made the 3hp finisher too important<br>
If the finishers aren&apos;t good, we find paladins just spam the builders and ignore the finishers, which feels bad too. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356128222188027904))<br>
<br>
To continue, we don&apos;t want every paladin playing like a Resto druid, and honestly neither should you paladins. EF shouldn&apos;t be mandatory. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355861121716076545))<br>
Agree100%. I am growing to hate having to take EF. Every fight my top heal is an absorb. Should just play my Disc priest.<br>
Exactly. We don&apos;t argue it&apos;s effective. But we question whether it&apos;s really fun or fits the paladin kit. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356131310349201408))<br>
If you recall, EF was limit one until very late in MoP beta. It&apos;s an example of a change we should not have made so late. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356131399725617152))<br>

+10% on LoD won&apos;t help much, increase the amount of targets hit and increase holy radiance&apos;s 6 target cap in 25man.<br>
We don&apos;t like non-CD AE heals with huge target caps. Trying it with HR only because we want Resto to be awesome when clumped. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356123712455573506))<br>

Then give us something to use as an alternative, the other two talents in that tier are a joke, at best.<br>

Don&apos;t want to play like a druid, either. Concerned about number balance since EF hot/shield accounts for so much on live<br>
Yes. Our strategy is to try to buff LoD w/out killing WoG or EF. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356119591811940352))<br>
<br>
i still dont understand why paladins are getting a fear when we have repentance, unless its instant n1 will go for it<br>

<br>
Healer balance is looking good! Feels like Shaman, Druids, Monks, and Priests are going into 5.4 feeling good. Pallies need &lt;3<br>
Going to try DP scaling with Spirit. GoAK with AE heals. Maybe buff to WoG, EF, LoD. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355422149588164609))<br>
Clarifications from Lore seems great. I hope the change to GoAK will be an overall buff. Also 40y on LoD would be nice.<br>
The intent is that GoAK is a buff. We agree that it&apos;s a lot of single-target overhealing in today&apos;s environment. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355485294163787778))<br>
Considered lowering the CD, but we&apos;d have to nerf the HPS and it would also get macro&apos;d with Divine Favor a lot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355485383926087681))<br>
What HPS? Paladin HPS is bad on the PTR.The updated GoAk on a 5min cd is hardly going to be enough to push that up.<br>
Do you have any logs or other data to support that? It&apos;s unfortunately too easy just to tweet for buffs with no support. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355775834843398144))<br>
<br>
Not nearly enough to compensate for SoI sadly.<br>
We didn&apos;t balance Holy around 100% SoI usage because we knew that was unrealistic. We balanced them around DP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355484508503543809))<br>
For Prot, we buffed Guarded by the Light to 15% mana return to compensate for SoI. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355484712644509696))<br>
Guys are making of mess of the last patch. Should of done this retooling with an expansion.<br>
It&apos;s often a tough balance. Many players want their issues fixed NOW and don&apos;t want to wait an indeterminate time in the future. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355775615292542976))<br>

These are reassuring words. Any chance that for Holy SoI/BattleHealer and Judgment could scale for SelflH use?<br>

Divine Plea no longer reduces healing in 5.4. Truth/datamine? What about Glyph of Divine Plea--changing?<br>

Holy Paladins are lacking in the PTR 5.4 at the moment. Any hope for compensation considering the Eternal Flame nerfs we got ?<br>
EF, like GoSac and KJC are intended as rule-breaking talents. We want to see some players use them but not all. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350645965289553920))<br>
It&apos;s funny, the talents that the warlock community, on average, liked the most, y&apos;all hate and decided to destroy<br>

Holy word:Sanctuary performs awful, increasing the reduced amount and radius insteadof reduce the mana cost is better. <br>
Sanc isn&apos;t intended to be a go to AE spell. It is intended to be layered with other spells to be ticking while they do. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356125748194586624))<br>
Too much buffing and it becomes like Healing Rain, a big weapon in the Resto toolkit. But that&apos;s not what we want for Sanc. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356125878645821440))<br>
<br>
speaking of healing is holy priest ever going to be as good as disc again?<br>
You have to define good. Holy is a great healer and better than Disc in some fights. Atonement makes Disc very popular in 10s. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356121942996160513))<br>
And Atonement itself isn&apos;t OP, but the ease with which Disc can swap from DPS healing to shielding is quite useful (esp in 10s). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356122075397758976))<br>
<br>
Dear crabby, is there any news regarding Divine Hymn becoming baseline again for all priest specs?<br>
We don&apos;t really think Disc or Shadow need more CDs or utility, respectively. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356119796623998977))<br>
<br>
with the recent changes to apparitions on the ptr, is there also a movement speed increase to them? Or would it not be needed?<br>
We don&apos;t want them to move super fast or they become just another missile. Shouldn&apos;t have big pathing problems anymore though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355395371582767106))<br>
whats wrong with JUST ANOTHER missile? its gona be the only missile shadowpriest has. STOP discriminating ffs<br>
Resistance to making everything the same is not the same as discrimination. We don&apos;t want SA to be Shadow Bolt. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355452448724357120))<br>

Limited, too. 30 sec Chakra CD makes it tough to be flexible.<br>

Any plans on giving disc divine hymh back? maybe make it share a cooldown with PW:B?<br>

<br>
Is Holy Priests&apos; HW: Sanc ever going to be looked at number wise? It&apos;s pretty terrible and even with new 4set won&apos;t be used.<br>
It is meant to be layered along with PoH etc. so both are happening at once. It isn&apos;t intended as a high priority AE heal. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352098044088549377))<br>
<br>
Holy regen is too low. Disc mp5 is very comfortable indeed, but nerfing it wouldn&apos;t solve the low holy regen.<br>
We are worried that Holy regen is where the other healers are but that Disc can largely ignore mana. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352096987484667907))<br>
<br>
clarify how you think holy competes w disc?Don&apos;t have utility or damage disc has chakra limits st/aoe heals gap esp &gt; in 10&apos;s<br>
Holy heals fine. I think the desirability of Disc in 10s is purely Atonement. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352094069754826753))<br>

Fierydemise has some raw sim date for your proposed combat changes (http://t.co/b0dyEezlzv). Combat&apos;s going to need more tbh.<br>

What use does the Conductivity Change have if you cant have 2 Healing Rains at a time?<br>
It isn&apos;t intended to let you splash rains around the entire raid, and technically the spell cannot even work that way. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350717995716325376))<br>
The idea is you can keep HR going without spending the cast time just by casting other spells. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350717845648314370))<br>
Why buff HR when we&apos;re already good in packed situations? Isn&apos;t HTT nerf making us weaker in spread situations? CH still slow<br>
We like that Resto shaman look at the battlefield and not just the target frames. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351126053885968386))<br>

Yes. That is the intent. Just need to rectify that with e.g. SCK. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351132023567564801))<br>
<br>
Resto Shaman are lacking in the PTR 5.4 at the moment. Any hope for compensation considering the poor spread healing we got ?<br>
We understand players will say that&apos;s not enough, but we still want shaman to care about grouping and to perform better then. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350716375645421568))<br>
Make chaining glyph baseline with no CD for resto.<br>
No CD means your rotation would likely turn into CH CH CH CH CH CH. It was that way once.... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350727214830059520))<br>
Also, if CH is being spam, that implies other abilities aren&apos;t good enough and should be buffed so CH doesn&apos;t HAVE to be spam<br>
That argues that no spell needs a cooldown, just buffs to other spells. We don&apos;t think rotations work that way. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350825953942970368))<br>
But the thing about grouping is that we are losing even on those fights to ppl who have better spread healing.<br>
Yes. This is what we&apos;re trying to fix. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351126385852551168))<br>
