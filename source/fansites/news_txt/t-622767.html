WotLK Prologue - Undead attacks on capital cities !<br>
It seems that the big part of the WotLK prologue just started ! More updates to come as we gather more information about this.<br>
<br>
Abominations and Frostwyrms are assaulting capital cities<br>
Faction Leaders have been moved around to help with the defense<br>
The event seems to repeat itself a few minutes after it ends<br>
Few changes have been made to the &quot;old&quot; parts of the events, most of the Argent NPCs are gone, battle count has been reset, etc ...<br>
