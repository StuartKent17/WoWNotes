Netherlight Crucible Update<br>
Hey guys!<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ve been seeing a lot of discussion going back and forth on the Crucible lately, so we&#x2019;ve had some conversations with the development team and I wanted to pop in and share a few points that came out of it.<br>
<br>
Regarding comparisons to Reforging &#x2013; Reforging was always a simple, mechanical choice. Players were, at the end of the day, simply replacing their worst stats with best stats on every item that didn&#x2019;t already have your best stats up to a mechanical limit. The Crucible, by comparison, is only affecting a small subset of items and presents much more varied situations than say &#x201C;change 30 Hit Chance into Haste&#x201D;.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ve also seen a bit of discussion around players desiring the ability to respec the Traits that are locked on the second and third tiers of relics. We feel that the ability to respect Traits would lead to players picking traits based on perfect optimization for any given situation, which could lead to players leaving a raid to change to AoE-centric traits for the next fight during raid progression. While we feel that&#x2019;s a nuisance in itself, this would also make the system feel like a watered-down version of talent rows, and would undermine the choice that is made when selecting your Relic Traits.<br>
<br>
That being said, Relics are items and will be replaced; we do expect players to make choices and experiment with this system. Since there is still new content ahead of us in Antorus, better Relics will be available and players who make choices they may not like now will have the opportunity to get new Relics before long with a potentially new set of Trait choices.<br>
<br>
As a note, we are also fine with the current state that Relics Soulbind on inspection in the Crucible. We believe the alternative of everyone porting in and out of the raid to pass the relic around and see who it&#x2019;s best for is far, far worse. Players are smart and will be able to make educated decisions based on the information that&#x2019;s available to them. As I said, we do expect experimentation however.<br>
<br>
A final note: I saw the post on Reddit laying out three choices for Relics, asking players which one they would pick -<br>
Relic A : 930 Ilvl BiS main trait, 3rd BiS bonus trait, but forces worst tier 2 crucible trait<br>
Relic B : 915 ilvl BiS main and bonus trait and 2nd BiS crucible tier 2 trait<br>
Relic C : 940 ilvl 2nd and 4th BiS traits and BiS crucible tier 2 trait.The poster responded by saying the only way to know is to sim it. If you&#x2019;re generally a player who simulates gear upgrades to make decisions, you&#x2019;re probably going to do that anyway, and that&#x2019;s fine. If you&#x2019;re a player going off basic guidelines such as &#x201C;I play a fire mage so I want Critical Strike&#x201D; you will get by as you always do in this situation and pick what you think is best for your particular class or spec. <br>
<br>
Thanks for all the feedback on the topic so far, I&#x2019;ll be on the lookout for future discussions, as always.<br>

This Week in WoW History<br>
We&apos;re taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br>
<br>
Legion Max Level Content Unlocked<br>
Legion allowed players to take their time leveling, delaying most of the max level content that people had previously rushed to level for until a few weeks after release. During this week, Normal and Heroic Emerald Nightmare unlocked, World Bosses started spawning, Mythic+ Dungeons opened, and the first PvP season started. <br>
<br>

BlizzCon 2015 In-Game Goodies Round-Up<br>
BlizzCon 2017 is rapidly approaching and we&apos;ve already seen the new Horde and Alliance mounts (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6986-BlizzCon-Virtual-Ticket-Stormwind-Skychaser-and-Orgrimmar-Interceptor-Mounts) that we will get this year. Looking back to 2015 we see the final in-game goodies roundup that included the incredibly cute and dangerous Murkidan, a Nexus Battle Beast Mount in Heroes, Hearthstone card back, Starcraft II Portraits, and a Pennant, Pet, and Portrait for Diablo III players. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor In-Game Cinematics<br>
During Warlords of Draenor Beta, Blizzard released all of the cinematics from the initial Warlords of Draenor campaign at once. This was done because the team was aware that some players enjoy spoilers and would seek out the cinematics on fansites. These included the iconic scene with Garrosh and Thrall, Yrel, Velen, the Warlords, and more. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Mists of Pandaria Zone Previews<br>
As more and more of Mists of Pandaria was being revealed, players finally got a chance to check out what some of the zones would look like. The previews included Krasarang Wilds, Dread Wastes, and Townlong Steppes. These offered some different environments and creatures than players had ever before scene, introducing the Klaxxi, Yaungol, and more Sha. Krasarang Wilds was a vibrant forest-like area teeming with all kinds of flora and fauna, Townlong Steppes housed the Shado-pan Garrison, and the Dread Wastes was an ashen and torn environment being overrun by Klaxxi.<br>

Appear Offline Coming &quot;Soon&quot;<br>
It may not seem like it, but it now has been five years since the Appear Offline &quot;Coming Soon&quot; notice was posted! Questions about the status of the feature is a favorite among BlizzCon Q&amp;A topics. In the years since, we got an update about adding Appear Offline to Overwatch in 2016 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6071-Upcoming-PvP-Balance-Changes-Appear-Offline-Blue-Tweets-DLC-558#appearOffline), another update in 2017 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6646-Glowcap-Festival-Tomb-of-Sargeras-Preview-Tweets-Overwatch-Offense-Hero-Secrets#appearOffline), and strings that refer to appearing offline were added to Hearthstone this year (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6795-Appear-Offline-Mode-Strings-in-Hearthstone-ToS-Progression-Black-Temple-Timewalking). For now, the Appear Offline feature appears to still be coming &quot;Soon&quot; (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Soon). <br>
