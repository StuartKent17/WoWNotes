Warlords of Draenor - Group Finder
Patch 5.4.2 adds cross realm listings to the Raid Browser, which has been in the game for several expansions now. Unfortunately only Ordos, the Celestials, and the Flex Siege of Orgrimmar wings are supported for now. 
Since we're still seeing some confusion about the Group Finder, let me try to clear up what I can:

There are two completely separate developments going on here. One is the cross-realm functionality being added to our existing Raid Browser in patch 5.4.2. This is totally unrelated to the new Group Finder we announced at Blizzcon. Basically, we discovered that we could pretty easily add cross-realm browsing to the Raid Browser for 5.4 content, so we've done that in 5.4.2.

6.0's Group Finder is an entirely different thing being built from scratch. It'll allow you to find or create groups for basically any content you can think of, be it raids, dungeons, PvP, questing... heck, you could start a group for running laps in Dalaran if you wanted. It also won't be hidden away someplace that the majority of the playerbase won't notice -- it's gonna be a lot more front-and-center.

A lot of players are drawing parallels between our new Group Finder and the oQueue addon, and that's a perfectly valid comparison. We've been thrilled to see how people have taken to oQueue for finding organized groups, especially in 5.4, and feel that's the sort of thing that the game really should be providing to all players. We're not trying to "kill oQueue"; in fact, a lot of us use it ourselves. We just think that cross-realm group finding should really be part of the core game.

Or do you thinking having everyone on each other friend's list is how Blizzard is going to implement it?
The 6.0 Group Finder will not rely on BattleTags or RealID to form groups, no. Of course, you're more than welcome to share that information yourself with players you meet, and make new friends!

If I'm taking you out of context I deeply apologize Lore, but are you saying Blizzard is alright for the time being with us using Open-Que? I ask because concern of violating the ToU is the prime reason I have not ever used it. 
Using oQueue does not violate the terms of service, no.

But with OQ you can put restrictions, view how well they've done before, and how well they're liked with the public. Openraid had a reputation how well people liked your raids and gave you upvotes. Is there any way they will add something like that to help people avoid groups lead by bad players, mean leaders or elitist jerks?
We do want to provide some options for group leaders to put some restrictions for who can and can't request to join their group. We don't want to do it in a way that encourages people to be too heavy-handed, but we also want to make the system easy and intuitive to use, and feel it's better for everyone if the system lets leaders be upfront about who they're willing to bring along.

Basically, we want to avoid a situation where you can be invited to a group and then immediately be kicked when the leader inspects your gear and finds you're 10 item levels lower than he or she is looking for and then have to repeat that process until you eventually either find a group that will bring you or give up entirely. We'd rather do our best to make sure you only see groups that you've actually got a shot at running with

Blue TweetsTanking Stats
What do i do with a +armor item when switching to dd spec?
Use it knowing you are wasting some stats, or swap those pieces out. You likely won't have armor in every non-armor slot. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402651261662535680
So maybe you're swapping 3-5 pieces? Much better than today, which asks you to swap everything or at least reforge it all. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402651429229174786

If dodge and parry are going byebye, Are tanks left with stacking mastery or stam? Gonna miss stat juggling.
We are going to add armor as a tanking stat. The combat mechanics can support that now. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403951575485259776

I just cant get in my head how "Bonus Armor" in gear is more interesting that Dodge/Parry 
Tanks gear for failure not success. Dodge and parry affected some boss swings. Bonus armor affects every one. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405460180369817601
Im fine with P/D gone but saying those werent "interesting" stats. Avoidance is more interesting than flat mitigation
The tanking community was debating this long before I even joined the team. Twitter can't do that discussion justice. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405464069777272832

Alts
Why dont you just limit accounts to one single char if you just dont want to support alts?
We like alts. But we get pressure from players who seemingly want to do content once, and then have all their alts ready to raid. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403643981231181824
Devil's advocate what's wrong with that? You believe questing is important them less so favoring other activities.
Players originally made alts because they wanted to experience other characters. They wanted to actually play them. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403953198341169152
There is some level of alt speed up that is appropriate, but we are hesitant to ever take too much of the "play them" away. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403953295846154241

What are the better solutions for power lvling up our alts? Seems like flying helps..
I find the very notion that an alt *needs* to be power leveled to be worthy of more discussion. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405083025228050432

PvP
You promised that vanilla pvp players would get some sort of recognition when Swifty interviewed you, any news on this in WoD?
I try not to promise much, but that is something we'd like to do. Did you rank in vanilla? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402646820632788992

Arena class rep imbalances spriest? WW monk? DK?, PvP gear worse than PvE gear in world PvP makes your side a hard sell!
I'd wager Arena and BG balance is more important to more players than the state of wPvP. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402539767042019328
World PvP hasn't really existed in much of a form since TM vs. SS, which stopped once players had BGs to run. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402539851628548097

So we will see the return of tanks in pvp? Great.
That's not the intention. Tanks in PvP aren't much fun for everyone else, except possibly as FCs. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402534852517306368

So if I've sunk days into Darkspear Horde, I'm just screwed? Timeless Isle isn't even fun because of the imbalance.
Our intent with Ashran is to connect that zone to get balanced factions. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403607426605129728
