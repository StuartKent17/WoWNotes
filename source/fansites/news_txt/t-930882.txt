Boubouille2011-07-02, 12:21 AMPatch 4.2 Hotfixes - July 1st / Firelands Heroic Disabled
We're now walking in the land of hotfixes land, with CMs doing a nice job compiling all the stuff Blizzard has been fixing for the past few days. Among other things ...



Firelands Heroic difficulty has been turned off in all regions until the following week's realm maintenance.


Which somehow confirms what was posted earlier on our forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/930006-Faction-Change-to-get-new-raid-lock-on-Heroic-bannable?p=12083298&viewfull=1#post12083298 about STARS being asked nicely to get out of the instance. 

July 1
General

Characters should no longer randomly suffer falling damage.


Classes

Pets should no longer be attacking new targets at random while a player is under the effects of any crowd control.

Puggable raids
No matter what Blizzard says, making new raid tiers undoable by pugs is total garbage. Personally I have absolutely no problem doing older raids, but seriously is making the first 2 or 3 or maybe 4 bosses of a new raid easy all that much to ask?
We actually do have a measurement of sorts in place like this. It might not be to your expectations if you want to successfully pug half of the bosses during the first week they're available, but it's worth mentioning it does exist.

Whenever designing a new raid dungeon, we have a basic 1-5 scale we use to rate each encounter in terms of complexity. While complexity may not be synonymous with difficulty in some cases, it is in most. So for an example of what we're looking at, every encounter in Molten Core would be a 1 on our scale in terms of complexity, while bosses like Cho'gall and Sinestra are each considered a 5. For an example of when a complex fight might not translate into difficulty once the mechanics are known by the raid, Flame Leviathan is also a 5 -- there are a LOT of mechanics in that fight.

So, using those few examples, I'll say we try to create the raids of today with the average complexity of all boss encounters dialed in around 2.5. We have to balance out the really complex encounters with encounters which have more simplistic mechanics. Again though, that doesn't always mean they're less difficult.

To define complexity, we're talking about all of the spells, abilities, scripts, or mechanics triggered during each fight. So if you look at a boss like Lucifron 1 in Molten Core, there are fewer than 5 mechanics in the whole fight. Meanwhile, Beth'tilac 5 in the Firelands has well over 100 mechanics not just spells and abilities, but triggers for webs, adds, etc..

Melee Friendly Encounters
Your reinterpretation seems to suggest that we're ignoring the issue when that's not the case. The take away from the quote should be that we were aware of the issues regarding ranged vs. melee, but that didn't mean that warriors got to outclass the other melee dps while we addressed them.

We're certainly aware that encounter design in the previous tier ended up feeling melee unfriendly. As a result, we were careful to include more melee friendly fights in the Firelands raid. We'll also make adjustments if things feel off in this tier of content though that doesn't necessarily mean that melee and ranged will be tied for the top spot on every boss fight.

Frenzied Regeneration Tooltip
Frenzied Regeneration tooltip is reading 15%. It should be, and is, 30%.
That's a tooltip bug. We got some nifty new and complicated tech for tooltips up and running for Cataclysm, which allows us to do things like make tooltips reflect talents and glyphs in a highly accurate fashion, as opposed to the static tooltips we used to have. Overall it's a good thing, but when a system gets more complicated there are more opportunities for bugs to show up as a natural consequence.

Rogue Deadly Poison Stacking and DPS Ramp Up
You've got a point.

While we're unlikely to eliminate dps ramp up time for rogues altogether, we're sensitive to the fact that rogues require multiple methods to do so, when combo points do a pretty good job of handling that job. We will look at methods of streamlining rogue dps ramp time at some point in the future.
