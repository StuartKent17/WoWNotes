Why are you making vendors sell the new class tomes? Tomes are an ideal item for Inscription and would fill the glyph void.<br>
Scribes craft Vantus runes, Darkmoon cards, scrolls, relics, toys, consumable glyphs, etc. Void should be filled. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/712468090999549952))<br>

Pets and Pet Battles<br>
what will happen to the Pet menagerie in Legion? Will it still reward that many pet charms as it is now?<br>
The pet charm rewards from Warlords content will be significantly reduced, but not eliminated completely. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/712467251211862016))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
It may be true that a tiny % of players post on social media, but are you going to neglect the info you have just because it&apos;s not perfect? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/712122737465032704))<br>
you have a concept of perfect info?<br>
Of course not. But it&apos;s very easy for game developers to tune out feedback because they are only hearing from a minority. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/712327998746177536))<br>
You should understand it&apos;s a minority, but still appreciate the feedback! (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/712328083823439872))<br>

&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/overwatchmini.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom:-2px; margin-right:0px; vertical-align:bottom&quot; /&gt; Overwatch - Tracer Pose Removal<br>
The developers responded to a feedback thread to let the community know they were replacing one of Tracer&apos;s poses.<br>
So I wanted to start off by saying, I think the development team has done a pretty great job with the cast of female hero&apos;s in Overwatch. They are diverse, interesting, and compelling. From Mei to Zarya to Widowmaker the female cast reflects a large spectrum of personalities and player fantasies.<br>
<br>
With that being said, lets talk about Tracer. From a marketing standpoint, she&apos;s the star of the show. She&apos;s a great hero. When we look at the way she&apos;s portrayed in promotional media, lore, and art in game we know a few things about her..<br>
<br>
She&apos;s Fast. She&apos;s Silly. She&apos;s Kind. She&apos;s a good Friend. Her body seems to be comprised of about 95% spunk.<br>
<br>
Almost all of her art reflects this. She&apos;s got cool skins, She&apos;s got fun poses, She&apos;s got amazing victory animations. All of this art reinforces the great character you&apos;ve built around tracer.<br>
<br>
Then out of seemingly no where we have this pose:<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
WHAT? What about this pose has anything to do with the character you&apos;re building in tracer? It&apos;s not fun, its not silly, it has nothing to do with being a fast elite killer. It just reduces tracer to another bland female sex symbol. <br>
<br>
We&apos;ll replace the pose. We want *everyone* to feel strong and heroic in our community. The last thing we want to do is make someone feel uncomfortable, under-appreciated or misrepresented.<br>
<br>
Apologies and we&apos;ll continue to try to do better.<br>
<br>
Well, that escalated quickly&#x2026;<br>
<br>
While I stand by my previous comment, I realize I should have been more clear. As the game director, I have final creative say over what does or does not go into the game. With this particular decision, it was an easy one to make&#x2014;not just for me, but for the art team as well. We actually already have an alternate pose that we love and we feel speaks more to the character of Tracer. We weren&#x2019;t entirely happy with the original pose, it was always one that we wrestled with creatively. That the pose had been called into question from an appropriateness standpoint by players in our community did help influence our decision&#x2014;getting that kind of feedback is part of the reason we&#x2019;re holding a closed beta test&#x2014;but it wasn&#x2019;t the only factor. We made the decision to go with a different pose in part because we shared some of the same concerns, but also because we wanted to create something better.<br>
<br>
We wouldn&#x2019;t do anything to sacrifice our creative vision for Overwatch, and we&#x2019;re not going to remove something solely because someone may take issue with it. Our goal isn&#x2019;t to water down or homogenize the world, or the diverse cast of heroes we&#x2019;ve built within it. We have poured so much of our heart and souls into this game that it would be a travesty for us to do so.<br>
<br>
We understand that not everyone will agree with our decision, and that&#x2019;s okay. That&#x2019;s what these kinds of public tests are for. This wasn&#x2019;t pandering or caving, though. This was the right call from our perspective, and we think the game will be just as fun the next time you play it.<br>
<br>
If it isn&#x2019;t, feel free to continue sharing your concerns, thoughts, and feedback about this and other issues you may have with the game, please just keep the discussion respectful.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
