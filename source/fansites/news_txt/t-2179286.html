Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Picture yourself still as a Blizzard designer. Now, you just got the news that a few more competitive guilds are leaving the progression races because there&#x2019;s no incentive to do that. You can&#x2019;t change the situation because it depends on structure and decisions that are bigger than you. How would you, Greg &#x201C;Ghostcrawler&#x201D; Street feel? What would be your thoughts? Can we get a glimpse of GC&#x2019;s mind in that hypothetical moment for a second, just for curiosity? <br>
Being in a competitive raiding guild, one that has a legit chance of getting a world first, can be a brutal situation. The expectations for the time you put in are enormous, and real life with its annoying things like &#x201C;jobs&#x201D; and &#x201C;families&#x201D; can really get in the way. The stress is high. In my experience, those guilds are often held together by the sheer force of will of a few officers or perhaps as a few as one really strong leader. The pressure on that person is enormous, and the guild is very fragile if that person decides he or she has had enough.<br>
<br>
I always admired progressive-oriented guilds a lot, but I knew I could never be in one. (I was in really hardcore guilds for years, but never thought we&#x2019;d get a world first.)<br>
<br>
So I would not necessarily look at a guild going casual or disbanding as a sign that there is something wrong with the game. I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s going on in WoW right now, so I can&#x2019;t say that definitively. But when it happened while I worked on WoW, we never said &#x201C;We have to make changes because guilds are giving up.&#x201D; We tried to do what we could to make life easier on them for things like lockout times and loot distribution and stuff like that. But when you&#x2019;re going into content dramatically undergeared (in that the later fights are designed around the assumption that you farm the earlier ones for weeks), AND you want to progress as fast as possible, or at least faster than rival guilds, that is an enormous ton of pressure.
