Legion Collector's Edition Mount - Illidari Felstalker
The Illidari Felstalker  is the Legion Collector's Edition Mount. Keep in mind that while it is flagged as a flying mount, there are currently no specific flying animations, so it uses swimming animations. There is no official confirmation that it will be able to fly.
