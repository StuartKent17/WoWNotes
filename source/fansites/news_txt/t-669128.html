The new World of Warcraft Faction Change service is now live in Europe. As we mentioned previously, http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=9895129741&amp;sid=1 (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=9895129741&amp;sid=1) we&#x2019;ve been in the process of developing a new service for World of Warcraft that will allow players to change their faction from Alliance to Horde or Horde to Alliance for a fee. After purchasing a Faction Change for a character, a player can choose any race of the opposite faction that is compatible with the character&#x2019;s class. Please note that all achievements and quest lines relating to the Argent Tournament are reset when a character uses the Faction Change service.<br>
<br>
For more information on the Faction Change service, please read the FAQ, http://eu.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=39810 (http://eu.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=39810) or visit the Faction Change page http://www.wow-europe.com/account/ (http://www.wow-europe.com/account/) to get started.<br>
<br>
We would also like to inform everyone that we will be offering a Race Change Service in the future. This decision was based largely on community feedback, and often in regards to the Faction Change service. Players who choose to switch races will be able to change their race within their same faction and class. Additional information and updates about Race Changes will be published at a future date.
