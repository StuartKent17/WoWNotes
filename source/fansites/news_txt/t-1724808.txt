http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/patch61.jpg http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/patch-notes/6-1 

New Heirloom Collections Tab

The Collections system now supports Heirloom items.
Heirlooms can be upgraded to increase the maximum level that the item scales up to.

Heirlooms with no upgrades can scale up to level 60.
Heirlooms with 1 upgrade level can scale up to level 90.
Heirlooms with 2 upgrade levels can scale up to level 100.
Old heirlooms that have been upgraded to scale to level 85 are grandfathered in with 1 upgrade level.

New Heirlooms for the neck slot are now available and allows the character to cast a heal once a minute. This heal shares a cooldown with potions and Healthstones.
Alternate methods for obtaining Heirlooms and Heirloom upgrade tokens are also available.

Argent Tournament sells Heirloom upgrade tokens for Champion's Seals.
Some world events now sell Heirloom upgrade tokens for currency obtained through the event.

Collecting 35 heirloom items awards a special mount that's usable by level 1 characters.


Garrisons, Followers, and Outposts

New Garrison Visitors

One of five new visitors may visit each day offering a quest to anyone that visits players with a Tier 3 Garrison.

Defeat a dungeon boss: Awards a bag with a chance to contain a level 630, 645, or 655 item token.
Defeat a raid boss weekly quest: Awards a bag with a chance to contain a level 645, or 655 item token.
Bounty intended for 3 or more players: Defeat a named elite NPC for gold with a chance once a day to obtain Bloody Stack of Invitations.
Relic: Complete a series of quests for gold or Garrison Resources. Completing a relic quest unlocks it as a potential mission for your followers. Complete all 6 relic missions to unlock Harrison Jones as a follower!
Profession: Turn-in tradeskill reagents for Primal Spirits and work order tradeskill reagents.


Summon a Raid or World Boss

Players may find an item while completing a Garrison Invasion, Dungeon, or Raid daily quest from the Garrison visitor that that allows them to summon one of six new raid or world boss in the Garrison.

New Garrison Vendor

There’s a new vendor coming to your Garrison who allows you to spend Garrison Resources on Follower Trait Retraining Guides or Follower Ability Retraining Manuals.



General

Removed the requirement to have a character that's level 55 or higher to unlock the Death Knight as a playable class.


Pet Battle

Level 100 characters with a Tier-3 Garrison will now receive an item in the mail that increases a single Battle Pet's level to 25.


PvP

Ashran

Grand Marshal Tremblade and High Warlord Volrath no longer award Conquest Points when defeated.


Battlegrounds and Arenas

A new queuing system is in place to help improve matchmaking for Oceanic arena teams hosted on Australian game servers. This new system will wait for a predetermined amount of time to match an Oceanic arena team against another Oceanic team before looking for opponents from the broader North American player pool. There's an expectation that queue times may be a slightly longer as a result but the increase should not be significant.
Bonus Honor received from winning a Battleground should now correctly convert into XP for characters that are below level 100.
Eye of the Storm: Icon for the flag should no longer be incorrectly displaying in the center of the map even though it's been picked up by another player.


Professions

Cooking

New self-only cooking recipes have been added for food that gives 125 bonus to a stat.



UI

Players now receive a banner notification after defeating a dungeon, raid, or world boss in Warlords of Draenor or Mists of Pandria.



Patch 6.1 Hotfixes
Lumbering Ancients Spawn Rate
Lumbering Ancients have always been rare and there was no change to the spawn rate. Having said that, there's a hotfix underway to make Lumbering Ancients multi-tap to help with this potential bottleneck.

The hotfix to make Lumbering Ancient should now be live. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/363246-lumbering-ancients-spawns-decreased/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16411181717?page=1#14

Heirloom Vendor Crowding
The hotfix to add collision around the Heirloom NPCs should now be live. Additionally, a dismount aura has been applied to Estelle Gendry Horde Heirloom Vendor via hotfix.

Tiger Strikes Hotfix
We recently found a significant bug with Tiger Strikes for all Monks, and wanted to explain the incoming fixes that will resolve it.

The bug itself was twofold. First off, Tiger Strikes was incorrectly able to trigger from unsuccessful autoattacks such as those that miss, or have been dodged or parried. However, it was NOT able to trigger from Multistrikes. We’ll be fixing Tiger Strikes to its intended behavior: it will no longer activate on unsuccessful autoattacks, but will be able to activate from successful Multistrikes.

Fixing those bugs will result in an overall damage gain for all Monks, so we’ll be making a couple other adjustments:

For Brewmasters, we’re going to reduce the damage done by Keg Smash by 20%. We felt that Brewmaster DPS was too strong already, and the Tiger Strikes fix only pushes them further.
Windwalkers and Mistweavers were a little weak, which is why we’re increasing Rising Sun Kick’s damage amplification debuff from 10% to 20% in 6.1. The Tiger Strikes fix will be a small damage increase on top of that, but we’re going to keep an eye on where Windwalkers and Mistweavers end up as a result of it before making any further adjustments if necessary.


These changes were not able to make it into the final 6.1 build, but will be hotfixed in shortly after 6.1 goes live.

Can we get an eta on the zen sphere detonate fix?
That's fixed in patch 6.1.

We did also find that Tiger Strikes was incorrectly using the lower dual-wield proc chance when Mistweavers were equipping one-handed items in conjunction with off-hand items. We’ll be fixing that to give the full 10% chance while in Crane Stance when these hotfixes go live.

We’ve also discovered that the tooltip for Tiger Strikes is incorrectly stating that the chance for it to activate is 6.25% while dual-wielding. The actual chance is 5% and has been since Warlords of Draenor released. The tooltip will be updated in a future patch.

If you don't mind me asking, is there anything you're going to do to address the Roll Perk bug? It increases the speed you roll by 25%, but also unintentionally reduces the distance traveled by 25% as well.
That should also be fixed in this round of hotfixes. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/363117-upcoming-tiger-strikes-hotfix/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16410181488?page=3#55

Combat Rogue's PvP 4-piece Set Bonus
The hotfix for Combat Rogue's PvP 4-piece set bonus was implemented and will now provide the Cold Blood effect after using Vanish. Note that the tooltip will incorrectly display text for the old set bonus. This will be fixed in a future client-side patch.

Cold Blood - Combat Rogue PvP 4-piece set bonus
When you use Vanish, you gain 5 Combo Points and the critical strike chance of your next Sinister Strike, Eviscerate, Revealing Strike, or Ambush is increased by 100%.

Follower Work Order Bonus
Is your Follower assigned to the building for each work order as it's completed? We closed a loophole that would allow you to assign a Follower to a building right before collecting the work orders, and gain all the bonus even though they weren't assigned to the building the whole time. The intended functionality and the one active in 6.1 is that the Follower needs to be assigned to the building as each work order completion ticks for their bonus to be applied.

Blackrock Foundry Missions
This is stupid, if you really need normal kills to get your mythic box.
You do not need to go back to a lower difficulty to be eligible for higher difficulty Raid Missions for followers.

Example: You don't need any Normal difficulty raid kills for your followers to qualify for Mythic Raid Missions.

Don't be stupid. We're told the way the system is supposed to work, and it's not working as advertised.
Source? The system is working correctly.

All information I've read up until today has been that you clear LFR enough you get normal. You clear normal enough you get heroic. You clear heroic enough you get mythic. You clear mythic enough you get mythic and some coin.
Without the source of what led the quoted poster to believe the system was working incorrectly I'm unable to investigate if the info they got was correct or not.

For the sake of further clarification, Highmaul progression is not required to unlock Blackrock Foundry Raid Missions. Progressing in Highmaul provides an alternate way to unlock Blackrock Foundry Raid Missions, but it's not required.

people with 30 BRF heroic kills, including blackhand, ARE NOT GETTING THE MYTHIC CACHE. how many heroic kills do we need. can some of these kills be in the same lockout.

I've not seen a SINGLE report of ANYONE getting the mythic cache who also didn't have 8 highmaul mythic kills.
Were the kills loot eligible? Killing the same boss multiple times in the same week does not count as a loot eligible kill.

Fur Trader: No other Traders Available Today?
Intended?
Yes, and it's region-wide.

Of the new Garrison visitors who is at your Garrison is random, and what they offer is randomly selected each day, but that same selection applies to that NPC regardless of whose Garrison they're at for the day. So for example, you have the raid quest NPC, and it's for Brackenspore, and anyone else who has the raid NPC for the day also has that same quest. Tomorrow the raid NPC will have a new random quest, and anyone who has the raid NPC will all have the same quest.

The idea is that you're visiting your friends and guildies Garrisons to get access to each of the 5 types of NPC's each day, but that you're not needing to visit a hundred Garrisons to complete all of their potential quests.

Patch Note Changes
"A new vendor has been added allowing players to use Garrison Resource to purchase items to upgrade Followers"

They don't mean the guy that starts invasions, right?
He sells nothing that is a guaranteed upgrade for your follower whatsoever.

Maybe I'm missing something.
The note was updated to the following: 

"There’s a new vendor coming to your Garrison who allows you to spend Garrison Resources on Follower Trait Retraining Guides or Follower Ability Retraining Manuals."

So, no. It wasn't a lie. Patch notes are an ongoing effort and we update them as quickly as possible when changes come in. This one was updated this morning to reflect the correct functionality.

Sorry for any confusion the note may have caused.

See, Blizzard never lies. They just tell you something then change the information when needed.
A lie would be with intent to deceive. There was no intent to deceive. I understand the frustration. As with any development cycle, things can change relatively fast and miscommunications can happen. We do our best to minimize those and when they do occur, we try to correct them right away. I also didn't try to deny that it had been different before. Yes, it was worded differently. Yes, the note had been incorrect. Yes, it's been since corrected. We'll keep working to make sure these errors don't happen in the future, but there's no guarantee they'll never happen again.

Proper etiquette when editing documents is to explain any revisions. Simply putting correction: or update: would have made all this a non-issue. Simply changing it smacks of deception and trying to fly under the radar. That's the problem I have, not that there was a mistake. Mistakes happen. Trying to hide them is another whole issue.
We document changes in the PTR notes this way as changes occur. These changes were made to the live notes which serve as a "new" document. It's a strange sort of beast in that, if we change things to show edits, it implies those edits came after publication vs. during which could confuse people who haven't been following along with the PTR notes. They just want to know how things work, not how they were documented before it went live. If that makes sense. There's no "hiding" anything, it's just a side effect of this sort of documentation and the anomalies that go with them.

In 6.0 you changed the cast animation of 'denounce' pala from directed to omni heal.Intended?Looks strange as a dmg spell
In 6.0 we performed an audit of which animations each spell used. Some changed which can be jarring, but they were intended. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/565692069315084289
So the "buff" animation on Deep Freeze & Counterspell is intended? Looks awful..
What you're referring to as the "buff" animation is not for buffs, but for indirect spells, which includes buffs. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/565697660909543424
Deep and CS seem pretty direct to me. /confused
