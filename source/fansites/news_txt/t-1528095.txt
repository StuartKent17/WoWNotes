Character Viewer Updated: Female Gnome & Male Tauren!
We’ve updated the viewer on our website http://us.battle.net/wow/en/warlords-of-draenor/#characters with two of the revised character models you’ll see in Azeroth and beyond with Warlords of Draenor. Meet the new and improved Tauren Male and Gnome Female!

Our character artists strived to recapture the charm of the classic models while taking advantage of the expressiveness of their fluid new animations to bring new life to these beloved characters. We hope you like the new looks as much as we enjoyed making them.

We’ll continue to unearth more of Draenor and the shiny visuals coming to World of Warcraft around the release of Warlords. Keep your magnifiers and spectacles ready!

Garrisons and Questing
It says, if you choose a certain building type, you will get different quests that open up for you, which kind of defeats the purpose of leveling up with your friend if you get very different quests? Will there still be a main quest chain to do, that has little to do with the garrisons, I am concerned if I was leveling and questing with a friend and we wanted different structures, we would have to do completely different quests, before teaming up again.
There are main quest-lines in each zone, yes, and when you pick a building for your Garrison, the quests associated with it are part of the side-quests in that zone. If you and your friend pick different buildings, some of your side-quests will be different while others may overlap. You can still adventure together and help each other out, though. because no matter where you are in Draenor, there will be lots of points-of-interest treasure, rare spawns, bonus objectives you both can encounter.

Blue Tweets
Several of these tweets are referring to the recent alpha patchnotes update http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/315561-warlords-of-draenor-alpha-patch-notes-05-23-2014/, so be sure to look at those notes for more context.
Classes
Every other tank has quite serious healing. Oh well, going to have to pin all hopes on Blood Craze.
All tanks will be *much* more healer dependant in Warlords. In Mists, tanks needed way too little external healing. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469784242432393216

On this note, has there been talk of prorating any proc chance associated with a partial DoT tick? Or too small to worry about?
It's something we'll do on specific periodics/procs if need be, but not worry about in the general case. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469917224057053184

In addition, ONLY Multi-strike Auto's giving 15 RP, in addition to losing Rune Regen, won't we see many more empty GCD's?
You'll see some empty GCDs, but not a ton. Remember that you're adding haste to the mix. That's big. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469784410271662080

Going over the new Blood changes, Scent of Blood proc'ing from Pestilence? Wouldn't this mean we will see far fewer stacks?
Potentially, but it's tuned around that. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469784585740369921

Heart strike being removed? Why?
It was overlapping in role way too much with Blood Boil / Pestilence. Merged them all. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469941203375378432

a bit late question, will blood dk's get a new "shield" like the rune strike gave before you removed it?
No, but check out the Enhanced Death Coil perk as its replacement. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469943676840337409

so what is the point in removing the shield from rune strike and give us death coil insted? coil is useless!
Death Coil is absolutely not useless; it's better than Rune Strike in every way now, and Blood's new RP spender. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469918821826842625
on live i have tryede using coil even whit max vengence and rune strike still hits for more, that will be chanced?
Yes. Death Coil is better than Rune Strike was, in every way. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469925764654063616

Sorry to really bug, but do you consider your old design of "hard to learn easy to master" balance, applies FDKs aswell?
No, I'd say that high-ilvl FrostDKs are 'easy to learn, easy to master' on live. Primarily because their tuning was such that... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469922592061550593
...their rotation devolved to spamming 3 buttons at high item level. We're working to ensure that doesn't happen in Warlords. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469922812451250176

Why was DK Army of the Dead damage reduced by 75%? Is it now intended to be a cosmetic ability rather than a powerful cooldown?
Not cosmetic, but not a huge damage source. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469947026050785280

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid / Skills http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/druid / WoD Talent Calculator http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#s
Can you comment on the removal of Pounce? It's rather iconic, thematically. That's what cats do.
Indeed, but it was awkward for Cats to have a stealth action bar for only 2 abilities, and also awkward to have 2 abilities that... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469931126060883968
...were only usable while stealthed but still taking up bar space, that many people just macro to combine with Shred/Rake anyway. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469931291895275521

Why did you guys basically add back in dream of cenarious for ferals, took away one of the interesting talents in the process.
Because Bloody Thrash was actually not very interesting; it was purely passive, and we don't want 2 passives on a row. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469942075480227840

The new balance stuff sounds even more confusing than the old. Is it basically a pendulum that's always swinging?
Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469945052467171328
Well, always while in combat and for 30sec after combat. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469945126597296128

The balance changes mostly sound good, but a 3 second starfire cast time is royally gonna screw over balance druids in pvp
Check out Enhanced Owlkin Frenzy. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469936855765778432
why is starsurge a 3 sec cast now? Same as chaos bolt? Will it do comparable dmg?
Starsurge is 1.5sec cast. Starfire is the 3sec cast. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469945961448366080

why 3.0 secs castime for starfire?,it doesn't even hit hard!,how will i cast this in pvp? will damage be proportional to it?OMG!
Yes, damage will be proportional. And check out Improved Owlkin Frenzy. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470013586832490498
thank you! for instance warlocks have chaosbolt which has a very long castime but deals a ton of damage! is something like that?
Chaos Bolt is also resource limited, and not able to be made instant. Not the same. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470017884840673280

So hyped for the Boomkin changes! Is the new Astral Showers passive or activated?
Passive. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469942200319475712

Seems like new Balance rotation is "snapshotting light", are you worried about affdots et al neutering skill check?
The Eclipse benefit on Moonfire/Sunfire is the only thing that's snapshot. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469950796243537920

is moonfire and sunfire doing equal dmg on each tick? the difference is astral shower?
Correct. And they benefit from different Eclipses, obviously. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470308022510555136

Any insight on the intended tools for Boomkins movement DPS either in movement heavy fights or PVP ?
Moonfire/Sunfire, Glyphed Astral Communion. Considering Starsurge being instant, but unsure yet. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470308334419992576

With the new Celestial Alignment, is that "maximum Eclipse bonus" a 30% boost to everything or a 15% boost?
30% before Mastery. It acts as if you were at 100 energy in both directions. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469942851183190017

oh dear god that is a lot to take in. A LOT. Like. What. That's a 100% spec redesign. Scared. Very scared.
It's a big change, indeed. We look forward to getting your feedback in alpha/beta, and iterating on the fun. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469914853956911104
Mostly worry about being in wrong eclipse wrong time for AoE vs Single Target. Just gotta get hands on it.
Both sides are good at both jobs, and Astral Communion can be used to line your cycle up with the fight. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469915424369684481
Hmm. That's good to hear. I worry about Charges & being w/o a proc for Haste boost consistently.
You can bank those charges for a long time, and doing so intelligently is one of the big skill differentiators. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469916066312118272
Also! Curious on Mana Regen. Currently 50% on Pushing Eclipse. What do I get mana from if no eclipse to push?
We'll likely need to give them some form of mana regen, but that didn't make the notes. Don't worry, mana won't limit DPS. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469926460086431744
Is this tied just to new environment design, or something changed in the backend of leap itself?
Changed; it'll be more reliable everywhere. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469933014458175488

How will Balance regen mana with new Eclipse mechanic?
Not sure of the exact mechanic, but the gameplay will remain similar to today: mana is a limit on off-healing, not DPS. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470022016074911745

Still processing all the Balance druid changes, but why make Starfire's cast time even longer? It's already painful.
To ensure that both sides line up well, and feel very different. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469924543109165056

shared charges is genius.
Pretty happy with Starsurge & Starfall sharing charges in order to get Starfall out of the single target rotationCelestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469918463180693505
balance energy only generated in combat or all the time?
Starts toward Lunar when you enter combat. 30sec after you leave combat, the next time it reaches 0, it stops there. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469927238977081344

Also lack of instant starsurge further removes the only burst opportunity which was RNG that moonkin had.
Reliably firing multiple Starsurges in a row is big. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469937069691658241
solar/lunar empowerment stack or are we meant to weave the starsurges between wrath/starfire
They do not stack. You'll want to place your Starsurges where you can follow them with 2 Starfires or 3 Wraths... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469944475121250304
...within the next 15sec. And preferably put those Starfires/Wraths near the top of the cycle peak. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469944930589085696

Re new Balance: Does Moonfire and Sunfire snapshot your Eclipse buff and update with all other procs?
Yes. Everything is dynamic *except* for the Eclipse level is snapshot when you cast it. So you want to cast them near the peak Eclipse Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469922336158646272
just to clarify, sorry if dumb question, this is when the cast is finished/leaves my hands, correct?
Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469930878311735296

will starsurge be instant with sun/moonfire procs still? Or is starsurge instant on its own now?
No, Starsurge is a 1.5sec cast time, but not instant. Charges means you can delay using it such as due to movement without loss. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469920685301587968
and what's the thought on the new lunar shower interacting differently with moonfire/sunfire?
Want to make the different sides feel and play differently. Pros/Cons to both. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469928427978379264
fair enough. Rewording my other question, does new mushroom just emit damage+slow while active? Or does it just emit the slow
Just the slow. Starfall+Hurrican for Balance AoE. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469936170189590528

What happened to Nature's Grace? And do Shooting Star procs still make Starsurge instant? Like the changes so far!
We'll tune Moonkin damage to be great without Nature's Grace. No, Shooting Stars doesn't make it instant, but cast time is 1.5sec. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469930299212587009
I don't understand...Nature's Grace removed or dmg loss smaller after Nature's Grace runs out? I
Nature's Grace is removed, yes. We're tuning Moonk damage to be great without it. Intended that Stellar Flare doesn't trigger SS. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469936643009687552

BTW can we get a cosmetic glyph of astral storm for the pretty astral storm effect?
Currently planning a glyph that swaps Starfall to Sunfall, and Hurricane to Astral Storm. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469952256918294528

Only way to make the new Balance DoTs work is to remove the eclipse snapshotting too. This way we're not rushed at the 30% mark.
It's a sine wave, which means it's much slower at the ends than in the middle. Easy to get 95%+ of optimal. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470009743319117825
What happens if Im in full Lunar, and it comes time to AoE which might actually happen since I no longer have control of eclipse
Then you use Starfall, which is now great for AoE. Additionally, Astral Communion is great for aligning Eclipse to the fight. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470012815588077568

And dont give Astral Communion as a solution. That's bunk. Sit there, do nothing for 7 seconds so I can AOE properly.
Starfall is quite good, and your description of Astral Communion is quite wrong, anyway; it'd be 3sec, not 7. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470013347144806400
So it would only take 3 seconds to go from one end of the eclipse bar to the other?
You move at 4x speed while channeling. In 3sec, you'd move the bar 12sec, which is where you want to be to Hurricane. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470014246994984960
That centers the Hurricane on the peak, with decent haste Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470014431783432193
I guess Im thinking of this as more of a pendulum where at the end of each swing is the strongest. Is that not the case?
Yes, that's correct. But AoEing takes time. If you go all the way to the end of the swing, you start on the downslope. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470015961886498816

What's with the Genesis notes? Looks like the same function as live. Ps ToL was taken in progression for mana. No ooc=weaktalent
More consistent with our changes to periodics. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469935424803057665

I have to ask, will the new Druid DoC talent copy all rejuv healing onto yourself or only 1? THe former seems overly strong.
It literally casts a Rejuv on yourself. Casting multiple Rejuvs is just extending the one on yourself. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470023154320945153
