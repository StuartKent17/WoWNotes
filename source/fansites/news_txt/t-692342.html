Patch 3.3.2 should be deployed on live servers this week, the really interesting stuff probably won&apos;t be available before the patch day because I need to get my hands on the files to start digging. (Mostly for the Lich King ending cinematic)<br>

MMO-Champion Forums Changes<br>
If you check the forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forum/) regualrly you probably noticed a bunch of changes during the past few days. If you&apos;re not a member yet it&apos;s probably a very good time to register (http://www.mmo-champion.com/register/)<br>
<br>
Forums reorganization<br>
I moved a couple of &quot;useless&quot; forums and merged them with others. We no longer have duplicate Raids &amp; Dungeons or General Discussions forums, the PvP forums have been merged, and a few inactive forums have been deleted. (Guides and News Submissions because the interesting stuff is usually on the &quot;real&quot; forums)<br>
<br>
Moderators!<br>
28 moderators have been added to the team! I do realize that it might look like they are trying to ban everything out there but the objective is to clean-up the forums and make them a happier place. The goal isn&apos;t to ban every non-constructive posts out there but we had to put a stop to a few bad habits.<br>
<br>
So far it looks like the effect on most forums has been very positive and the quality of the discussion here went all the way up (it doesn&apos;t mean that I&apos;m happy with everything, send me a private message or a mail if you feel like something is wrong). I&apos;m still looking for moderators for a few boards but keep in mind that 10% of the people who applied were recruited, you really need a fairly serious post history to join the moderators team. <br>
<br>
New forums<br>
Now that the forums are a little more under control, I can finally add new forums! A new off-topic category has been added. <br>
<br>

 Discuss movies and TV Shows here! &lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br>
<br>
The goal with these new forums is to let you posts about non-related WoW subjects without spamming the current ones. Depending on the success of the new boards I might add a few more of them in the future.<br>
<br>
I would also like to point out that the moderation will be very strict on the new forums until we get things started, if you plan to post here I STRONGLY suggest that you read the rules : <br>
