WoWModelViewer
WoWModelViewer  has been updated to version 0.5.09. Tier 6 items aren't listed under their real name, but you can find them by searching for "T6" for each slot.
The major change on this version is the possibility to show .wmo files buildings, ships, etc ..., and I'm sure it will make some movie makers/photoshoppers very happy.
