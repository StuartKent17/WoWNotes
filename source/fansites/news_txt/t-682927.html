<br>
Icecrown Citadel Progression Update<br>
As noted in game, the release of the Plagueworks in Icecrown Citadel occurs 28 days after patch 3.3.0 was released. After the Plagueworks is available, you will then wait less than 28 days for the next wing to become active. The extended length of the initial 28 day delay is simply due to the timing of the Holidays.<br>
<br>
In other news, the initial number of attempts to defeat the major bosses at the end of each wing of Icecrown Citadel has been increased by 5. This means you&#x2019;ll have 10 attempts for Professor Putricide, 15 attempts when The Crimson Halls are available, then 20 when the Frostwing Halls becomes attackable. <br>
<br>
Halls of Reflection Disconnect Issue Resolved<br>
Let me be the first to say &quot;yay!&quot;. You can hug your local Gamemasters for taking the time to resolve this issue every time it was possible.<br>
We have recently implemented a fix that allows players to walk up the ramp and open the item chest at the end of Halls of Reflection as intended. We are actively working through the tickets we received on this issue and will handle them as quickly as possible. We thank you for your patience as we worked through this issue and apologize for any inconvenience. <br>
<br>
Deathbringer Saurfang Spawn Issue<br>
We just deployed a hotfix addressing the spawning of Deathbringer Saurfang. You will need to soft reset the instance for the fix to take effect. Sorry for the inconvenience, all.<br>
<br>
[...] Upon further review, the hotfix will require a server restart. I have no ETA on when we will be restarting the servers. Again, sorry for the inconvenience. <br>
<br>
Patch 3.3 Inventory Issue<br>
A fix was implemented earlier this morning and this issue should no longer be occurring. Thank you for your patience.<br>
<br>

<br>
There is an issue currently affecting the cross-realm dungeons when one player wins an item roll and then trades that item to another player who is from another realm. Under these circumstances, when leaving the instance the item may appear to be lost for some players. We expect this issue to be resolved as soon as possible, but want to remind players that they will need to have space available in the original backpack for the item to be returned when the resolution is complete.</div></div>
