Micky Neilson Leaving Blizzard
Micky Neilson has worked at Blizzard for 22 years and is currently the Publishing Lead, working on projects like Overwatch: First Strike , an upcoming upcoming Overwatch graphic novel. Reidor on Twitter  shared the news from his newsletter. 
After 22 years, I'm leaving Blizzard.

The time has come for me to pursue personal projects that I love. I'll be moving from California to Washington State. My last day at Blizzard will be March 25th.

I look forward to working with Blizzard on freelance projects, one of which will be announced shortly. Aside from that, my upcoming works might include more game-related writing, script writing, consultation...and most certainly, novels. All of which will be announced and discussed right here in this newsletter, once a month. 

I spent some of the best years of my life at Blizzard. It's a bittersweet departure to say the least. But I'm excited for the all the opportunities that lie ahead! 

So...there you have it, the big news. Thank you for all your continued support!

Hope this finds you all well.

Stay awesome,
--Mick
