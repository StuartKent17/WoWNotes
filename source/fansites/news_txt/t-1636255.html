Warlords of Draenor - Gearing Up for Heroic Dungeons<br>
A few people have mentioned having trouble getting the item level required for heroic dungeons, so here are a few ways to grab some easy upgrades:<br>
<br>
<br>
There are several item level 610 quest rewards from Nagrand. These can randomly upgrade to epic item level 620 items. (Coif of Grasping Earth (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118156-coif-of-grasping-earth) =&gt; Coif of Grasping Earth (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118156-coif-of-grasping-earth?bonusIDs=545))<br>
Proving Grounds (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/37433-proving-grounds) bronze will reward an item level 610 weapon (http://www.wowdb.com/items/119463-staff-of-trials), which can also randomly upgrade to epic item level 630 (http://www.wowdb.com/items/119463-staff-of-trials?bonusIDs=15) or rare item level 620 (http://www.wowdb.com/items/119463-staff-of-trials?bonusIDs=171).<br>
There are several rare spawns that drop item level 620 rare gear (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=620&amp;filter-ilvl-max=620&amp;filter-quality=8&amp;filter-source=8). (Not all of it is listed yet, install the WoWDB addon and help!)<br>
PvP Honor gear is item level 620: Cloth (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor/cloth?filter-ilvl-min=620&amp;filter-ilvl-max=620&amp;filter-source=256), Leather (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor/leather?filter-ilvl-min=620&amp;filter-ilvl-max=620&amp;filter-source=256), Mail (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor/mail?filter-ilvl-min=620&amp;filter-ilvl-max=620&amp;filter-source=256), Plate (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor/plate?filter-ilvl-min=620&amp;filter-ilvl-max=620&amp;filter-source=256), other armor (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor?filter-ilvl-min=620&amp;filter-ilvl-max=620&amp;filter-source=256&amp;filter-slot=71684), and weapons (http://www.wowdb.com/items/weapons?filter-ilvl-min=620&amp;filter-ilvl-max=620&amp;filter-source=256).<br>
Normal dungeons offer item level 615 gear (Grimrail Depot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/890-Warlords-of-Draenor-Grimrail-Depot), Shadowmoon Burial Grounds (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/894-Warlords-of-Draenor-Shadowmoon-Burial-Grounds), The Everbloom (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/856-Warlords-of-Draenor-The-Everbloom), Upper Blackrock Spire (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/915-Warlords-of-Draenor-Upper-Blackrock-Spire))<br>
Apexis Crystal (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/420-Warlords-of-Draenor-Apexis-Crystals) allow you to purchase rare item level 630 gear (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-sold-currency=823&amp;filter-ilvl-min=630&amp;filter-ilvl-max=630&amp;filter-quality=8&amp;filter-source=16384) for 3,000 to 5,000 crystals each, which can be upgraded later for more crystals.<br>
The legendary quest line rewards an epic item level 640 ring (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor/rings?filter-ilvl-min=640&amp;filter-ilvl-max=640&amp;filter-source=1024) from running Normal difficulty dungeons.<br>
There are some crafted items (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=601&amp;filter-ilvl-max=641&amp;filter-source=2) you can make with a Level 2 profession building. Keep in mind you can only equip three crafted items at a time.<br>
There are a few other options, but they are likely not accessible yet or easy for most people. These include BoE world drops, Level 100 garrison missions, and more. <br>
<br>
<br>
Followers and Garrison Missions XP<br>
Got an update from one of our designers that wanted provide more information on how your Followers gain XP when you send them out on Garrison Missions.<br>
<br>
When Followers are below a mission&#x2019;s level, they get a reduced percentage of the mission XP as well as any bonus XP earned.<br>
<br>
Followers that are 1-2 levels below the mission level:<br>
<br>
The Follower&#x2019;s level number is displayed in orange, meaning they only receive 50% of the mission XP and bonus XP. <br>
Followers that are 3 or more levels below the mission level:<br>
The Follower&#x2019;s level number is displayed in red, meaning they only receive 10% of the mission XP and bonus XP. <br>
Before a hotfix that was implemented at 5:52pm PST, followers in red received 0% of the mission XP; and we felt that was not what we wanted since the UI didn&#x2019;t indicate that was the case. <br>
<br>
<br>
Note that while level 90 missions may only award ~100XP, level 100 missions award much more, closer to the range of ~1500XP. So 10% of that is still a good amount for a level 90 Follower, even if they won&apos;t be doing a great job at getting the bonus loot until they gain some combat experience.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;d love to continue hearing feedback on how it feels to level Followers, what missions are available, and how these new numbers feel.<br>
<br>

Bug Fixs<br>
Is the enchanters study suppose to not disenchant epics? Or is it bugged?<br>
Intended (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/534490881177305088))<br>
<br>
Is it intended to obtain ilvl 660 tournament gear for gold? Is it an exploit people make use of?<br>
Obtaining it, yes, as it&apos;s only usable in War Games. Using it to bypass ilevel requirements is not. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/534477126032846848))<br>
<br>
just a thought: scale the 680 rings back to 640 for anyone without the quest completed<br>
We&apos;re exploring options, too early to say at this point. (Rygarius (https://twitter.com/Rygarius/status/534585507087273984))<br>
<br>
Doesn&apos;t seem to mention the change made to the Smuggler&apos;s Run loot table - no resource boxes any more?<br>
We generally do not note changes designed to fix an exploit. (Rygarius (https://twitter.com/Rygarius/status/534533862911909888))<br>
