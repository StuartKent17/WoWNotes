Comics
Now that the 2.1.0 PTRs are closed, we've got enough room to do Comics news again, hurray. We'll start with the latest even if they're a few days old if you missed them.


   

Heroic Loots
Added the location on the Gauntlets of Dissension. The list should be fairly complete now based on what's available on Wowhead, but there will probably be more on the next update.

[Handguards of the Steady] > Pathaleon Heroic Mechanar
[Mantle of Shadowy Embrace] > Keli'dan the Breaker Heroic Blood Furnace
[Eye of the Stalker] > The Black Stalker Heroic Underbog
[Pauldrons of Wild Magic] > Quagmirran Heroic Slave Pens
[Spaulders of Dementia] > Talon King Ikiss Heroic Sethekk Halls
The Fel Barrier > Nexus-Prince Shaffar Heroic Mana-Tombs
[Wrath Infused Gauntlets] > Vazruden & Nazan Heroic Hellfire Ramparts
[Gauntlets of Dissension] > Warp Splinter.

Ogri'la
Did an edit on the last news, but will re-add it here too. The Ogri'la  page now look like ... Ogri'la. 

The webmaster sucks
Sorry for the late update today, I managed to crash a power supply and explode another one in the same day. If I forgot to answer a mail or a MP about something just send it again, it's kinda hard to keep tracks of what I've done today.
