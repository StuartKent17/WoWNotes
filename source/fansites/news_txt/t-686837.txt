Boubouille2010-01-02, 06:50 PMBlizzard will be back to work on Monday and announcements/regular blue posts will be back as well! 

Plagueworks unlock next week!
The next raid wing of the Icecrown Citadel will unlock next week and will give players a chance to fight:
Rotface 
Festergut 
Professor Putricide , your new favorite boss if you like Futurama 

Important - You only have 10 attempts to kill Professor Putricide because of the Icecrown Citadel Gating  The number was changed from 5 to 10 since the original announcement 

It also means that people working on Shadow's Edge  will finally have a chance to get Festergut's Acidic Blood  and Rotface's Acidic Blood  to complete The Sacred and the Corrupt  


     


Cataclysm - Screenshot Compilation
I started working on early versions of the Cataclysm zone pages earlier this week and noticed that I never posted a decent compilation of Cataclysm screenshots. I added the name of the zone to each screenshots to make browsing easier.

Gear Requirements for Random Dungeons
The gear requirements are very generous. They are there more to make sure that somebody who has no idea what they are doing say someone's first character who doesn't even know the dungeon names doesn't get into one of the harder instances until they have a little more than quest blues.

If you're sophisticated enough to be posting on these forums, then you're sophisticated enough to know what tanking an Icecrown dungeon requires and whether you're up to the task. Source

2pc T10 Elemental Set causing 7 days cooldowns
You may not want to use the set while using Dungeon Finder until we know for sure what the problem is. When we have an update, we'll be sure to let you know. Source 


Dark Legacy Comic - Best of 2009
It's not a secret that I'm a big fan of Dark Legacy Comics , I thought it would be fun to make a small compilation of the comics I prefered this year.
