Legion - Kosumoth the Hungering Rare Spawn
Arcten and other players figured out how to spawn  how to summon Kosumoth the Hungering ! Killing him won't do much for you unless you have the world quest, which is unlocked by completing the process below. This week the quest appears to reward Fathom Dweller  for EU and Hungering Claw  for the US.


<iframe width="900" height="506" src="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>



Initial Steps

Talk to Drak'thul  out on the Broken Shore  until he has no more dialogue options for you to choose from.
Head to the cave at 58, 54 on the Broken Isles, die and resurrect if needed to get past the rocks, go to the very back, click the Mound of Dirt to loot the Weathered Relic  
The mound is hard to see , so look carefully. 
Return to Drak'thul and talk to him again until he has no more dialogue options for you to choose from. This requires opening and closing the dialogue window.


Orb Notes

Next you will need to click on ten different orbs, in order. Each has a 50 minute respawn time per realm. 
You can use this macro to check if you got credit for an orb: /dump IsQuestFlaggedCompletedQuestID
The Quest ID for each orb is listed in parenthesis in the steps below.
Orb 6 and 9 are bottlenecks, as they are located in a place where players from multiple realms appear. 
Changing zones, waiting, or logging in and out will cause the DANGER: Kosumoth the Hungering  quest to appear, rewarding you with Hungering Claw  or Fathom Dweller , depending on what is up for your region this week.


Orb Collection

The orbs must be clicked in order.
Orb 1 43730 - Go to 37.9, 37.5 in Azsuna and enter the cave at the base of the tree 
Orb 2 43731 - Go to 63.7, 36.2 in Suramar and take the path up the cliff  right before reaching Stormheim. Turn right on the path, head up the cliff towards Stormheim, make a small drop off the rock to the tree on the side of the cliff. Enter the cave  at 32.9, 75.8 and beware of the mob inside.
Orb 3 43732 - Go to Lorlathil in Val'sharah, take the road west to Thas'talah and head south towards the cliff, enter the cave at the base of the tree  at 41, 81. The mob inside casts a high damage spell, beware!
Orb 4 43733 - Go to 31.3, 76.9 in the Broken Shore, swim down into the fatigue water  and into the cave  
Orb 5 43734 - Go to 59.3, 12.9 in Azsuna, entering the cave at the base of a tree  in the purple rift on the map.

Orb 7 43736 - Go to 55.8, 38.6 in Highmountain. You will need to drop down off the cliff  a short distance to reach this cave, which is another hidden by some bushes.
Orb 8 43737 - Go to 54.1, 26.3 in Azsuna, entering the cave at the base of a tree  The orb is towards the back of the cave under a bush 
Orb 9 43760 - Head to 79, 89.0 in Eye of Azshara and swim down to the sunken ship. Inside of it you will find a cave. This orb will have people from multiple realms.

Legion Developer Q&A- Friday, September 9
Join us live on Twitch  Friday, September 9, as we sit down with Assistant Game Director Ion Hazzikostas for our next live developer Q&A. Now that Legion is live, he’ll be answering many of your questions on the expansion.

Feel free to submit any Legion specific questions by posting in this forum thread  or via Twitter using the hashtag #LegionQA.

We’re really looking forward to getting the chance to dive in and answer as much as we can, so we hope to see you Friday at 11 a.m. PT!


Patch 7.0.3 Hotfixes - September 6
Classes

 Demon Hunter Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

The Discipline Priest artifact trait Sins of the Many  will now properly increase Atonement healing done.
Spending artifact trait points as a Discipline Priest should no longer reduce the amount of Atonement healing done by Shadowfiend or Mindbender.


Class Halls

In Skyhold, Quartermaster Durnholf will pay more attention to players and not walk away from them so quickly.


Dungeons

Assault on Violet Hold

Mindflayer Kaahrj's Faceless Tendril should now prefer targets that are not being targeted by Eternal Darkness.

Developers’ Notes: The two toys above combined, or in conjunction with other things such as Emerald Winds  were too effective and diminished the value of utility and world-navigation tools that are core to certain classes and professions.

Touch of the Void: the tentacles summoned by this trinket no longer scale past level 100.
Reduced the active effect potency of Heirloom trinkets acquired from Warlords of Draenor Mythic Dungeons.
Fixed a bug that could cause players, who were simultaneously both very lucky and very unlucky, to receive the same legendary item more than once.


Missions

Significantly improved the quality of the bonus reward available on Artifact Power missions..


NPCs

Pollous the Fetid in Val'sharah should no longer evade and become unkillable.
Unstable Powers now target fewer players with their Unstable Power orbs.

Druids who abandoned either "Essence of Balance" or "Essence of Regrowth" should now be able to reaccept the quests by returning to the Emerald Dreamway.
Profession World Quests can now be completed in a raid group.


Suramar

Completing the quest "Make Your Mark" should now properly count progress towards the achievement "Why Can't I Hold All This Mana?"
Players who have completed "Jarl Come Back Now" but are not Neutral with Jandvik Vrykul can return to Toryl in Jandvik to get their reputation reset.



Legion Companion App FAQ
With the release of the WoW Legion Companion App, we’ve seen a number of questions from the community that we’d like to address. Here are some answers to some of the most-frequently asked questions:

Q: Why do I keep getting the same notifications when I close the app?
A: This is a known issue, which we plan to fix in the next update to the Legion Companion App.

Q: My authenticator app is on the same device as the WoW app, is there a way to avoid having to switch to the Authenticator app to approve a code while logging in?
A: There are two ways to avoid this. When you get the “Check your Authenticator for request…” message, do one of the following:

1 Swipe down on the notification itself to reveal an “Approve” button. Tap that and login will continue. 2 Scroll down and tap the “Use Authenticator Security Code” link. This should import a code automatically from the Authenticator app if it is on the same device. Then scroll down and tap “Submit” to enter the code.

Q: I have a character that has champions, but the app says it doesn’t, and won’t let me log in. What’s going on?
A: This is a known issue and a fix is being applied, but it may take a day to fully update world-wide. As a workaround, try logging in and out of the affected character on your computer before logging in on the app.

Q: Why do I have to log in every time I use the app?
A: You don’t! If you are on the title screen and have previously logged in, you should see the “Characters” button. Tap that instead of “Login” and you will bypass the login step and go straight to character selection.

Q: Will the Legion Companion App be released for Windows or Amazon phones?
A: We are currently not planning to support any platforms other than iOS and Android at this time.
