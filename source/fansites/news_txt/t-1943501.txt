Blue Tweets
whats with all the minor glyph removals?
The glyph system is being updated, so a lot of data is changing. Many of those effects will still be available. WarcraftDevs 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Do you still play World of Warcraft?
I don't, but I am always hesitant that when I say that, for fear players will somehow try to use it to argue for their own agenda.

Here are my reasons:

1 As a player, I needed a break. I had played WoW for nearly a decade without a break, with a lot of heavy raiding. I fully expect I will go back at some point.

2 As a developer, I needed a little distance. WoW was part of my DNA for many years. Jumping back into the game felt like cruising by the house of my ex all the time and asking her how her current BF was treating her, and maybe giving him some pointers on how to handle her. It just felt weird. It has been two years, so that has mostly dried up.

3 As a designer, I needed more broad exposure. When I played WoW, it was harder to find time to play other games. Blizzard now has so many games, that they make it really hard to play non-Blizzard games too! When I interviewed at Riot, I struggled with answering some questions because I hadn't played all of the games I should have. I vowed to keep more abreast of the industry and not make WoW or LoL! my only game.
