With Warlords of Draenor set to launch on Thursday, November 13, we&#x2019;ve seen a few questions about how that fits in with our plans for the upcoming 10-year anniversary content. We&#x2019;re looking forward to celebrating this epic milestone with you, and we want to make sure everyone has plenty of opportunity to take part while still being able to fully enjoy what the expansion has to offer.<br>
<br>
The 10-year anniversary celebration will begin in-game on Friday, November 21 and will last until Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 10 a.m. PST. Everyone who logs in during this time period will receive the incredibly cuddly, feisty, and fiery new Molten Corgi to love, pet, and call their own. You&#x2019;ll also be able to participate in a pair of special events to commemorate the occasion.<br>
<br>
Maximum Molten Core<br>
One of WoW&#x2019;s classic 40-player dungeons, Molten Core, will be available in Raid Finder during the anniversary period for level 100 players. Making it through the underground gauntlet and defeating Ragnaros will reward players with a Core Hound mount and a Warlords of Draenor Raid Finder&#x2013;quality helm (100% guaranteed!). For a walkthrough of the dungeon as it stands today, check out our Revisiting Heroism&#x2019;s Past &#x2013; Molten Core guide.<br>

Southshore vs. Tarren Mill&#x2014;The Battle Continues<br>
To recapture the feeling of the endless tug-of-war of early WoW PvP, we&#x2019;ll be opening a Team Deathmatch&#x2013;style Battleground based on the timeless struggle between Southshore and Tarren Mill. We&#x2019;ll have two different brackets for players to take part in: one for levels 90&#x2013;99 characters and another for level 100. Unlike the old days of Tarren Mill vs. Southshore, there will be a clearly defined victor, so you&#x2019;ll need to work as a team or face crushing defeat. A win will gain you a shiny new title: either Tarren Mill Terror for the Alliance or Southshore Slayer for the Horde.<br>

Onward into Warlords of Draenor<br>
With the release of Warlords of Draenor, all unrated PvP Battlegrounds, Skirmishes, and other unrated PvP activities will be available immediately. The new rated season will begin Tuesday, December 2 at 8 a.m. PST.<br>
<br>
We also wanted to make sure that everyone had time to level up before we opened our first Raid dungeon, Highmaul, in Normal and Heroic modes. These will open at the same time as the rated PvP season (December 2), with Raid Finder and Mythic modes opening the following week. We&#x2019;ll provide a complete schedule in the future for those who wish to start planning their new Raid calendars.
