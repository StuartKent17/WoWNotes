Cataclysm Hotfixes - Updated Dec. 16
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. While many have already been deployed on all realms, some may not be implemented until the next time your realm is restarted. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.

December 16
General

Bonuses from Embrace of the Shale Spider and Blessing of Forgotten Kings can no longer stack.
Completing Archaeology projects will once again contribute to the guild achievement Making History once the player relogs.
The Orgrimmar portal to Mount Hyjal should now appear for players who flew directly into Hyjal to start questing, rather than take the Moonglade portal.
The old and busted Winter's Veil decorations in Brill have been disabled.


 Paladin Forums  / Cataclysm Talent Calculator  / Beta Skills/Talents 

Ancient Power now has a 30-second maximum duration and will properly be canceled when zoning or relogging.
Glyph of Seal of Insight now correctly increases healing done by Word of Glory and Light of Dawn while Seal of Insight is active.


 Shaman Forums  / Cataclysm Talent Calculator  / Beta Skills/Talents 

The Mana Tide Totem hotfix from yesterday has been reverted. The Mana Tide buff no longer stacks, as this had a major impact on encounter design.


 Warlock Forums  / Cataclysm Talent Calculator  / Beta Skills/Talents 

It is no longer possible to waste a Soulstone by attempting to use it on a dead target. The player will receive an Invalid Target error message at the completion of their channel. In a future patch, we intend this functionality to work correctly, allowing a Soulstone to be used to instantly resurrect a dead target.


Dungeons & Raids
Halls of Origination

The damage of Fireballs automatically cast by Temple Fireshaper with Molten Barrier active has been adjusted in normal and Heroic difficulty.
The damage of Pact of Darkness cast by Temple Shadowlancer has been adjusted in normal and Heroic difficulty.


Lost City of Tol'vir

Siamat will cast Deflecting Winds after a few seconds of entering combat regardless of any abilities used against him at the start of the encounter.
The damage of Dust Flail cast by Lockmaw has been adjusted in normal difficulty.


The Stonecore

The Crystal Shards creatures in the Corborus encounter are now level 86, down from 88.


Items

Both normal and Heroic versions of Heart of Ignacious apply 20-second cooldowns on other similar items, rather than the full 2-minute duration.
Shroud of Dark Memories and Shade of Death now have different stats.


Professions

Pyrite Ore is prospectable at 500 Jewelcrafting skill, down from 525.
Darkbrew Lager can be learned at 415 Cooking skill, down from 425.
The Engineering item High-Powered Bolt Gun can no longer be used in Arena and Rated Battleground matches.
Engineers can now purchase Smooth Cogwheels from Frank Natale using 4x Handful of Obsidium Bolts.

In-progress dungeons
If you choose specific dungeons instead of the Random Dungeon option, you should never get an in-progress dungeon. We understand you may be looking for a specific dungeon boss because of a loot drop, achievement, etc., so it may be in your best interest to queue for that particular dungeon if this is the case.

We don't want to make it too easy for players to skip over in-progress dungeons. What would happen is a Dungeon Finder group would virtually always be abandoned as soon as anyone leaves the group.

Also, I think right now you're seeing more in-progress dungeons pop because, in general, the dungeons are more challenging now than they were when the Looking For Dungeon feature was first introduced in Wrath of the Lich King. Some players may get frustrated and bail at the first sign of trouble, instead of realizing that everyone may have to work a little harder than they're used to in order to conquer a dungeon. Source
