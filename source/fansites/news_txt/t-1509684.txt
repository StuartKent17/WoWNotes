Flying in Warlords of Draenor
Will flight be available at some point in warlords.
Ok, ok, being perfectly honest... we don't know. In the same way we have no idea what the gearing model for the final tier of the expansion could be, because it's going to be based on testing, and playing, and seeing how the expansion plays out up to that point. We're open and willing to change the game as we go to make it the best it can be.

We don't know because we're open to feedback, and making changes based on that feedback. 

Our current focus is to get the expansion into a state where you guys can help us start testing it. That testing will inform many, many decisions, and how the game plays when it's launched will inform how the first content patch is designed, and how that patch plays out will inform the second content patch, etc. etc. We'd rather be unsure and make the correct decisions when they need to be made, than make the wrong decisions and be too stubborn to change them.


Warlords of Draenor PvE Changes
It's important not to skip over the Group Finder section! It'll help everyone, regardless of their current focus, be able to find and create groups for content:

Another central innovation in Warlords is our Group Finder feature, which will allow players to easily form and search for raid groups among other activities with players from their entire region. While this series of blogs has mostly focused on pre-existing social structures, pick-up groups continue to be tremendously important. Chance meetings in such groups have formed the basis for many a friendship, and recurring weekly pickup groups have given rise to more than a few guilds over the years. For players who want to take the next step beyond Raid Finder, or who want to find a weekend run for their alt, or who just need a last-minute tenth member for their raid, Group Finder will make that process easier than ever before.

To your concern: It took me a very long time to even be able to be considered for flex runs and whatnot on my server due to the super high standards every group leader seems to have.

One pretty cool factor of the Group Finder tool will be that people won't be able to start groups and require things of others they themselves have not achieved. Such as requiring an ilvl higher than what they themselves currently have.

The new Group Finder will be something everyone has access to, it'll allow all players within an entire region to easily find each other, which will make it a very active place to find groups, and we hope through some smart options and rules, getting into organized group content much, much easier for everyone.

Have you ever seen people this upset BEFORE AN EXPANSION WAS ACTUALLY RELEASED? Usually players are happy and excited for a new expansion!
I've been in Community for every World of Warcraft expansion, and yes, it's the same every single time.

People are always concerned with changes, and concern is fine, and we'll communicate our intent, and you'll tell us how well you think it'll work out, or if it seems like a good or bad idea for you and how you play the game, and we'll have a beta test where we figure all these things out, and we'll make adjustments, and decisions, and etc. etc.

It does tend to be a bit more upsetting before actual live testing begins. We announce changes, we put info out there, it's confusing, it's out of context a lot of the time, and it just is generally when our least productive feedback comes in. When testing actually begins and people can play the game and see how it's working, that's generally when things calm down, people see the results of these changes, there's context, and we can get into the nitty gritty testing and balancing.

But yes, I've seen people upset before every single expansion for the last 10 years. Mainly because saying "I'm so excited!" isn't much of a conversation starter. "This will ruin the game forever." tends to create more responses and threads.

Classes
Will you address things like blood presence and defensive stance in pvp. Having to sit in them to live is no fun in pvp
Those stances provide an interesting interaction between going offensive/defensive. holinka 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
"Camouflage no longer breaks from dealing or taking damage."How can this possibly be a thing?
It can be! As with many other changes we're making, it's somewhat experimental, and we'll adjust if it's too strong. Celestalon 
The 6 second in combat duration makes sense, but if you use it once before entering combat. 60 seconds of ranged immunity?
No, it'll drop to 6sec on entering combat. Celestalon 

How many new hunter pets are there going to be in WoD? How many of them will be exotic?
3 new families, 1 of which is exotic, and many new models/skins for existing families. Celestalon 

hey, any word on Careful Aim become a passive or active talent? 
Sounds like some sort of misinterpretation. There's a couple Draenor Perks that massively increase the power of Careful Aim. Celestalon 
It's stronger than many other classes' cooldowns. But it's staying a Passive, no intention to make it an Active. Celestalon 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
FoF glyph will be mandatory for raiding like RsK minor is now. Disagree w/fixing design flaws by restricting choice
My prediction: Some encounter will make 3 other glyphs particularly strong, and someone will begrudgingly try going without... Celestalon 
...Floating Butterfly. And after learning that fight thoroughly, they'll start to recognize when they can FoF without having... Celestalon 
...moving, and realize that "Huh... It's harder, but maybe we CAN do without this..." And it'll start to be used ~half the time. Celestalon 

Will Path of Mist talent drop orbs when using Chi Torpedo? Can those orbs be used with detonate chi?
Yes. Yes. Celestalon 

which class do you personally feel have had/needed the biggest rewamp, and why? Hard to decipher from a long list 
Mistweavers, definitely. Talked about a lot in their section. Celestalon 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Any thoughts on the idea of making Colossus Smash a talent? There's so many of us that hate how it changes our rotation -_-
To make sure I understand, the concern is with feeling like you always need to pool resources and then unload during CSmash? WatcherDev 

Without Recklessness and Execute Perk 50% are Gladiator Stance Warriors going to be tuned to keep up with Arms/Fury?
Yes. Celestalon 

Art
How come we haven't seen 3D armor like thatlike boots for players yet?What was the reason?Is it possible for WoD?
Items for players are different, and need to fit on every race. With NPC armor, it's literally part of his geometry. WatcherDev 
I see, thanks for that. Was wondering if it's possible to add more geosets, or even see anchored armor cheers
It's something out art team and engine team are working towards, since we agree it'd be awesome. Not yet, though. WatcherDev 

Character / Items
what about timeless coins? i seem to have a ton but have bought everything i wanted from vendors
Coins are staying island-fresh. Spend them on gliders, masks, and pug hats! Muffinus 
How about rep? No chance of it going the way of the troll rep when raid was converted ?
Staying around, you can always go back and kill more Ordon or kill FOR the Ordon Muffinus 

Just to make sure, all four CM Phoenixes can't be obtained on a single character, right? I'd need to do silver on 3 alts? 
Incorrect -- in 6.0 if any character has earned one, your entire account will get all 4. WatcherDev 

any word on what the reforge mount will become? Thanks 
The leading contender is transmog. WatcherDev 

Warlords of Draenor Stats
Hey, you might not be the right person, but I was curious - for the stat squish, how much of it is a manual process for Blizz?
Most of it was done programatically. We do need to manually adjust a number of creature spells, though - that work is ongoing. WatcherDev 

PvE
Will there be any stepping nerfs to SoO like in previous final tiers?
Not planned in light of multiple difficulties, item upgrades, and a smooth tuning curve. Is there a boss you think needs a nerf? WatcherDev 

Cool. Have you figured out a way to add dungeons in patches? You spoke about it at Blizzcon but didn't have any set plans yet.
Still something we want to do. Focused on making 6.0 awesome first, then we'll turn to patch content. WatcherDev 

PvP
hey long ago there was pic of dota1 map for BG can you say if it will come in WoD?
It will not come in Warlords. holinka 

Misc
Is there any plans to give voices there own slider in audio.1/2 the time i can't here what the npcs r saying over the spell spam
It's something we'd like to do, hopefully for 6.0 but if not, then soon after. WatcherDev
