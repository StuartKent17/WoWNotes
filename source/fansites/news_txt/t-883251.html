We&#x2019;ve been following discussions and reading feedback on the Dungeon Finder Call to Arms feature, and appreciate everyone&#x2019;s opinions on the topic. We wanted to share a few items though that supplement the recent announcement:<br>
<br>
The additional reward for completing the Dungeon Finder Call to Arms (called the Satchel of Exotic Mysteries) will be Bind on Account; able to be freely sent to other characters on your account once you receive it.<br>
<br>
An error existed in the announcement regarding flasks and potions being picked based on your spec. This is not the case. If someone earns a Satchel of Exotic Mysteries, and if it rolls the random chance to provide a potion or flask, it will be a randomly selected. This helps ensure a broad array of available flasks and potions for all characters.<br>
<br>
We also wanted to clarify, mounts that have a possibility to be found in a Satchel of Exotic Mysteries are found with the same rarity as if you had slain the dungeon boss that normally drops them.</div></div>
