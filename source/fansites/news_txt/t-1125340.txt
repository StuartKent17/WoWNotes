Boubouille2012-05-01, 03:58 PMMists of Pandaria - Beta Build 15657
A minor build will be deployed on beta realms shortly, it seems to have mostly spell changes and a lot of model bugfixes but we'll keep digging! I also assume that this build is here to unlock the level cap and open the Shado-pan Monastery and Mogu'shan Palace to players. 

New Items
Nothing really interesting, some Glyph items have also been added and probably means that some of the new glyphs are now craftable, or will be soon.
