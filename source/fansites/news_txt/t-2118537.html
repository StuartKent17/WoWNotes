Legendary Item Bad Luck Protection<br>
Yes, bad luck protection does exist.<br>
<br>
When it comes to most targettable loot from a boss (gear/mounts/pets etc.) those drops have a fixed drop chance. If &quot;Boots of Unending Awesomeness&quot; have a 33% chance of dropping, that chance will always be 33% regardless of how many loot-eligible times you kill that boss.<br>
<br>
Legendaries on the other hand, if you are running Legendary-eligible content and don&apos;t get a Legendary, then your chance of getting one with increase over time. The more content you do without getting a Legendary, the higher your chance will become.<br>
<br>
Let&apos;s say you have 3-sided die. If you roll the number 3, you get the item.<br>
<br>
In the case of the &quot;Boots of Unending Awesomeness,&quot; you could roll the die 20 times and never get a 3. Your chance of getting a 3 on your next roll is still 33%, as all rolls are considered unique and do not take previous rolls into account; the die cares not for the fact that you&apos;ve yet to roll a 3.*<br>
<br>
(*note that this refers to the items that drop directly from the boss and not the system of winning items via bonus loot, which has its own logic.)<br>
<br>
In the case of Legendaries, you could roll the die 20 times and never get a 3. However, with bad-luck protection, the die will become more and more weighted toward giving you a 3. Due to the die becoming more weighted, the chance of getting a 3 on your next roll will be higher than without bad luck protection.
