The latest beta build reintroduced class masteries in-game! Masteries are affected by the Mastery Rating on your gear.<br>
<br>
For example, a level 82 player will get 1 Mastery point for each 93 Mastery Rating he has. This mastery point will increase the mastery bonus differently depending on the class, +1 Mastery Point doesn&apos;t necessarily means a +1% increase to the bonus. (e.g. A Beast Mastery hunter with +2 Mastery gets +4% increased pet damage) <br>

Undead on a Raptor on a Shark with frickin&apos; laser beams!<br>
I know I already posted it on Facebook and Twitter but ... damn, it&apos;s a Undead on a Raptor on a Shark with frickin&apos; laser beams!<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/july/undeadonraptoronsharkwithfrickinlaserbeams_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/july/undeadonraptoronsharkwithfrickinlaserbeams.jpg)<br>
<br>
Maybe I missed the memo on levels of &quot;epicosity&quot; or something, but I&apos;m pretty sure the Maelstrom is a CLASS 10 epic zone. Though I guess it is missing sharks with laser beams patrolling the waters and Arthur Fonzarelli jumping across it with water skis. And dinosaurs. <br>
<br>
[...] After reading this post I called for a meeting with TOP TOP MEN (that&apos;s two tops) in order to figure out a solution to the problem at hand. Frankly, I think we hit a home run. The next 4.0 build (or the one after) should have a Maelstrom that&apos;s between 10 - 50x more epic than what currently exists.<br>

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/mage.jpg Fire Mage Talent Preview<br>
Quick preview of upcoming fire changes (talents are from left to right, *denotes a change to the talent):<br>
<br>
Tier 1:<br>
Master of Elements: now 2 ranks at 15/30%<br>
Burning Soul<br>
Incineration: removed<br>
Improved Fire Blast: moved from tier 2<br>
<br>
<br>
Tier 2:<br>
Ignite<br>
Fire Power: Increases the damage of your Fire spells by 1/2/3% and gives your Flame Orb a 33/66/100% chance to explode at the end of its duration.<br>
Blazing Speed<br>
Impact (no useful raid utility yet... awesome ideas welcome)<br>
<br>
<br>
Tier 3:<br>
Cauterize (new, 2 ranks): You have a 50/100%% chance that an attack which would otherwise kill you will instead bring you to 40% of your maximum health. However, you will burn for 12% of your maximum health every second for the next 4 sec. This effect cannot occur more than once per minute.<br>
Blast Wave: A wave of flame radiates outward from the target location, damaging all enemies caught within the blast for X Fire damage and are slowed by 75% for 3 sec.<br>
Molten Shields (new 1 rank, Blazing Speed is a prereq): Reduces the global cooldown of your Mage Ward spell by 1.5 sec and your Mage Ward triggers the Blazing Speed effect when it dissipates from absorbing damage.<br>
Improved Scorch: Reduces the mana cost of your Scorch spell by 50/100%<br>
<br>
<br>
Tier 4:<br>
Pyromaniac<br>
Combustion<br>
Hot Streak (the instant Pyroblast no longer costs mana)<br>
Firestarter (new, 1 rank): Your Molten Armor allows you to cast the Scorch spell while moving instead of reducing the chance you are critically hit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tier 5:<br>
Improved Flamestrike<br>
Dragon&apos;s Breath<br>
Molten Fury<br>
<br>
<br>
Tier 6:<br>
Critical Mass: Your Pyroblast and Scorch spells have a 33/66/100% chance to cause your target to be vulnerable to spell damage, increasing spell critical strike chance against that target by 5% and lasts 30 sec.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tier 7:<br>
Living Bomb <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

End of Arena Season<br>
The only information that we have to share with you right now is that we will announce the end of the arena season when it is almost over, just like in every previous season. We don&apos;t provide date estimates on anything and this is no exception. Several other people understood what I was saying and the end result is that you will have to wait.

Survival &quot;Melee Attack Speed&quot; buff in Raid Buffs List<br>
The &quot;20% melee attack speed&quot; is in fact melee and ranged attack speed. That was just developer shorthand on my part.<br>
<br>
The effect for Survival will probably get tied into Hunting Party since Replenishment alone doesn&apos;t do anything for hunters and longer. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262989101/concerned-about-survival-s-future/))<br>

Water Elemental Cooldown<br>
The post-death cooldown will definitely be lowered to around 2 min, the intent is definitely that after it dies you&apos;re waiting a somewhat similar amount of time before it&apos;s up again as you would have under the old scheme. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702262953/mage/))<br>

<br>
Reactive Barrier<br>
There&apos;s a reasonable chance a talent like this ends up being better in practical use than in theorycraft. It could end up needing a little something extra, or a redesign, but I&apos;m willing to let it ride for a while to see how it actually plays out.

Shadow<br>
We haven&apos;t worked on the Shadow tree much after out initial pass (that brought Shadowy Apparition et al.). We&apos;re working on it now. Please don&apos;t expect a total overhaul where every talent is redesigned, but we are taking a hard look at all of the damage talents and trying to make the talent choices more compelling (which often means harder).

Elusiveness / Dirty Tricks<br>
Elusiveness being too deep was considered a grave injustice. So we moved it up and switched it with Dirty Tricks, causing a new injustice. We&apos;ll try and find room in tier 2 for both. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262769761/rogues-blizzard-aren-t-idiots/))<br>

Totems<br>
We&apos;re fine with totem health given how easy totems are to replace. We also think it&apos;s fine to have to (sometimes) choose between a buff totem and a non-buff totem given how many different things a shaman can do.<br>
<br>
However, we are going to increase buff totem range (and possibly other totem range) and we have figured out a way to make Searing Totem attack your target, instead of a random and probably inappropriate target.

<br>
Protection changes in Build 12664<br>
We buffed Thunder Clap to make up for the loss of the Imp TClap talent. We buffed Shockwave just because it got caught up in the big AE nerf, but it&apos;s really not an AE on the level of Hurricane / Blizzard. We buffed Devastate because we realized we had forgotten to compensate it for reducing the number of Sunder stacks.<br>
<br>
All of those changes should bring Prot warrior abilities back to something that feels more normal to a current warrior.<br>
<br>
Currently we are looking really hard at AE damage abilities by all tanks. We tried Thunder Clap with no cooldown and didn&apos;t like it. We also tried Thunder Clap with a Consecrate-like talent, but I&apos;m not sure we like that either. At the moment we are thinking of nerfing any of the really passive AEs, including Swipe, Death and Decay, Damage Shield and Consecrate. All of those abilities (well, maybe not Damage Shield) would still be usable, but they would be more situational.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that we think all tanks need to be able to trivially handle the massive adds or straggling adds situations easily, or none of them should be able to. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262869673/warrior-12664-changes-and-discussion/))<br>
