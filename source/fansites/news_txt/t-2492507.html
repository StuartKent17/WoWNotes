We&#x2019;ll have our next stress test for WoW Classic on 2019-06-19T21:00:00Z. This stress test will be accessible to anyone with an active World of Warcraft game account in the Americas &amp; Oceania region. For players who have not yet tested World of Warcraft Classic, the game will become available for download late tomorrow, June 18.<br>
<br>
For this stress test, all races and classes will be available for creation, and the maximum character level will be capped at 15. In addition to the open world, there will be instanced content available at that level. This will include Warsong Gulch for PvP as well as Ragefire Chasm, Wailing Caverns, and Deadmines. Of course, Deadmines will be a challenge for players to complete at this level.<br>
<br>
Please focus as much play as possible during the first three hours of the stress test. During this time, we&#x2019;ll be looking for more issues to address under initial launch conditions. The stress test realm will remain available for 48 hours.<br>
<br>
If you encounter any issues during the test, please let us know by using the in-game bug reporting tool. If there is anything you&#x2019;d like to discuss further, feel free to post here in the Classic Discussion forum.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much!</div></div>
