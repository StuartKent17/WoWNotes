Theramore to be destroyed by the Horde in 5.0?
It seems that Theramore will be destroyed by the Horde in the pre-Mists of Pandaria world events, the info was revealed to a couple of taiwanese websites attending a press event with Tom Chilton. Translation from Curll on ScrollsOfLore http://www.scrollsoflore.com/forums/showpost.php?p=368927&postcount=43.

聯盟部落的對立，要如何去強調？
整個戰爭會從潘達利亞的迷霧資料片上市前會啟動世界事件，來強化 聯盟根部落的戰鬥，塞拉摩這城市摧毀讓聯盟 高層非常暴怒，也會以此為契機強化這兩方的戰鬥，未來整個戰鬥會 蔓延在潘達利亞*陸上，部落與聯盟也會在上 面發動許多的戰鬥以及與熊貓人的互動。

Here's the original quote. Let me translate:
The whole war will be ignited during the world event which leading the game into Mist of Pandaria. Theramore will be destroyed and the leaders of Alliance were outrageous at this matter and completely devote themselves into the war, which reach its peak on the continent of Pandaria. The Horde and the Alliance literally fought on the homeland of Pandaria, which pissed the pandarens off.

部落跟聯盟都很喜歡去殺對方的首領，那熊貓人的首領怎麼算？
在潘達利亞*陸上的 npc 多是中立角色，一部分的熊貓人覺得部落跟聯盟帶來厄運，並對它們 帶有敵意，玩家玩的熊貓人是早已脫離潘達利 亞的熊貓人，在等級達到之後選擇加入陣營，所以是沒有首領可以去 扁的。
Most of the pandarens are neutral characters. And some of them thought the Horde and the Alliance only brought doom to their beloved homeland, and have enmity against both factions. The players pandarens are in a different group. They departed Pandaria long ago and choose their own path. They choose their own faction when level 10, so they don't have a faction leader.

This is a pretty good deal for anyone playing WoW, especially since the time between the last patch of Cataclysm and the beginning of Mists of Pandaria will probably much shorter than it was for WotLK/Cataclysm.
