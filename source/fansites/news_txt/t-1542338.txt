Warlords of Draenor Beta Servers Live
The beta servers are now active and alpha characters have been wiped, but the intro experience isn't open just yet.


  

  


Faction Cities Moved to Ashran
Mumper let everyone know last night that the faction cities that were originally supposed to be in Frostfire Ridge and Shadowmoon Valley were moved to just outside of Ashran. This has led to a long discussion on the forums 


  


Warlords of Draenor Beta Invites
Bashiok answered  a few questions about this invite wave on Twitter.


Invites in this wave were targeted to WoW Veterans rather than being random. Not every veteran will get an invite in this wave.
Both US and EU players were invited in this wave.
PAX keys are not enabled yet.
You don't need to be subscribed to the game currently to get an invite.



  


Warlords of Draenor Alpha Characters Wiped
If you had alpha access, you will find that all of your characters have been wiped. If you are in beta, you may be able to copy your Live account data and characters after maintenance is complete.
