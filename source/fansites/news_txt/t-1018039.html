Activision Blizzard latest earning call revealed that World of Warcraft lost another 800,000 subscribers last quarter, following the loss of 300k subscribers announced last quarter (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2400-WoW-Lost-300k-Subscribers-Patch-4.3-this-year-Blizzcon-2011-Tickets-Blue-Posts) and 600k loss from the quarter before that (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/901731-WoW-Loses-600k-Subscribers-Diablo-3-Beta-Q3-2011-Arena-Passe-Blue-Posts). This brings us to 1.7 million subscribers lost in the last 3 quarters. Some things they made note of on the call:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Most of the subscriptions were lost in China. <br>
There is normally an increase in subscriptions around December. <br>
The decreased profit came from all of the games in development and no launches occurring. <br>
There will be at least two major releases next year.<br>
