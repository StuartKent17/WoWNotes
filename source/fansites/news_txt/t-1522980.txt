Asking again b/c you said it's okay: Is the goal of Resolve to keep defensive & healing abilities exactly as strong as now?
I wouldn't say the same as 'now' meaning live. Tank AM *gameplay* is awesome, but its *effectiveness* is too strong on live. Celestalon 
And yes, those things are quite connected. We just want to skew toward tanks needing more external healing than they do today. Celestalon

Shame about no Dread Raven, because those are the coolest birds I've seen in WoW. At least we know Chimeras maybe? How come maybe?
Lots of new stuff in Draenor ravager, bat, boar, etc., some things might warrant a cool quest/drop like dinomancy/rhok'delar Muffinus 

Since you're talking about hunter pets a bit, PLEASE tell me we can tame talbuks! You'll make my day! Week even!
Not at the moment, open to the idea but it's a snowball of ungulates. Ungulate is an awful name for a family too. Muffinus 

Will MM Hunters be losing Master Marksman? If not, how will it interact with Focusing Shot?
No, Master Marksman stays, and does interact with Focusing Shot. Celestalon

Second: Why not allow Surging Mist to generate 1 Chi for Windwalker? Serious question. I understand why not for Brewmaster.
It's definitely less clear for WW than BM, as you say. It's something we're considering, but not sure. Generating 1 may be OK, ... Celestalon 
...because that's still a significant loss compared to the 2 chi from Jab. We're still evaluating that. Celestalon 

Finally: Will Fists of Fury's AP snapshotting stay? It doesn't snapshot TeB, which makes it weird, so that's why I'm asking.
Don't think so; I think it's going to be totally dynamic. Celestalon 

Why do Healing Spheres still exist as an object? Mobility is being tuned down in WoD making picking them up even more punitive.
You still get the healing even if they're not picked up, making them not punitive. Celestalon

Holy Shield Update? When i saw it in vanilla, as a d2 fan i was so happy! Can't wait for its glorious and useful return!
We actually were running the numbers and found that at 10%, it's not really that far off of our targets. Celestalon 
So then is gladiator stance over tuned? 10% block=3% phys damage reduction. How does that compare vs 5% total damage reduction?
10% block is >3% damage reduction. Not that we necessarily balance Pally talents vs Warrior talents, but these should be similar. Celestalon 

Character / Items
will 4/4 upgraded legendary cloaks proc more often?
Nope. Lots of stats though. WatcherDev 

why was the choice made to display tooltips for CDR trinks as 'cooldown recovery rate'? very unintuitive for the players.
We actually show both forms of it in 6.0, for that reason. Celestalon 

why not have multi gear equip slots for multi specsresto/dps/tank that is going to save a lot of bag space?
We're making changes to make most gear sharable between specs, including cross-primarystat. Check out the patch notes. Celestalon 
I'm not sure if this was shared anywhere, but is it intended that tier gear still remains unique and spec specific?
No, tier gear is shared across specs too. Celestalon 

Since valor is being removed. How is the system going to adjust so very unlucky people get gear? coins don't help very unlucky
Just because there's no "valor" doesn't mean there won't be alternate sources of gear, including vendors. WatcherDev 

Achievements
So much for Bigger Bag not being able to be account wide eh?No seriously. THANK YOU.
There were technical hurdles, but they were worth clearing to solve a major point of frustration for players. WatcherDev 

Warlords of Draenor Stats
Will the MS stat work on bleeds the same way it works on dot ticks/ignite ticks, double the tick but not the whole dot debuff?
Yes. Celestalon 


Patch 5.4.8 Hotfixes - May 21
Battlegrounds and Arenas

Resolved an issue where the Rated Battleground flag carrier debuff functioned incorrectly. Characters in a Tanking specialization should now correctly take 50% additional damage while carrying a flag in a Rated Battleground.


Items

Replica General's Leather Treads  no longer increases the duration of Sprint in Arenas or Rated Battlegrounds.
Burden of Eternity  may no longer be used while inside a Heroic Dungeon, Raid, or Scenario.


Bug Fixes

Resolved an issue where Feats of Strength for Collector's Edition: Dread Raven and Collector’s Edition: Dread Hatchling were not being correctly awarded to players.
Resolved an issue where players transitioning from Eastern Plaguelands into Ghostlands while on certain flying mounts would be unable to resummon the mount until the they relog back in.



Rated Battleground Flag Carrier Hotfixes
We’ve recently identified an issue that was causing the Rated Battleground flag carrier debuff to function incorrectly. Under normal circumstances, non-tank flag carriers in Warsong Gulch and Twin Peaks should take 20% additional damage, and tank-specced flag carriers should take 50% additional damage. Currently, that debuff is only increasing damage to tank-specced players by 20%. We’re in the process of applying a hotfix that will, once again, cause tank-specced players to take 50% increased damage when carrying the flag. This hotfix will be applied as soon as possible, and will not require realm restarts to activate.

In addition, we’re working on expanding that functionality to orb carriers in Rated Temple of Kotmogu, and cart carriers in Rated Deepwind Gorge. In Temple of Kotmogu, we’ll be increasing the extra damage taken while carrying the orb to 50% if the player has chosen a tank specialization. In Deepwind Gorge, we’ll be applying the same debuff used in Warsong Gulch and Twin Peaks. Cart carriers who have chosen a DPS or healing specialization will take 20% increased damage, while cart carriers who have chosen a tank specialization will take 50% increased damage. These changes will not be applied until next week’s realm maintenance.

These mechanics and changes are exclusive to Rated Battlegrounds. They will not be applied to non-Rated BGs.

One addition: why not EOTS? We can still hold flags there with no debuff.
We don't think the same debuff is the best solution for Eye of the Storm, but we are considering some other potential options. We agree that turtling with the flag doesn't result in the best gameplay.
