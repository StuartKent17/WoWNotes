Boubouille2010-09-02, 02:17 AMCataclysm - Glyph Interface Preview
The new interface for Glyphs is finally available and it comes with a couple of very interesting improvements. 


The biggest change, Glyphs are no longer a consumable item. You learn them and can swap them at any time after that, without having to buy them again.
Prime Glyphs slots have been added
All Glyphs are now listed, including the one you didn't learn yet. 
You can search for Glyphs, and filter them.
