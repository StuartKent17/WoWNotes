Boubouille2007-09-03, 06:30 AM2.2 Patch
Friday, Hortus made a post on the PTR forums about downtimes in the next weeks, I don't really know how I missed it. 

Because we are currently implementing many fixes for sound issues in 2.2 we will likely be pushing new patches to the PTR late at night several times in the upcoming weeks.

As I'm usually not around that late in the evening I can not always make announcements when it goes down.

So if the server goes down late at night, do not panic, it will most likely come back up in a few hours with a new patch.

There is a rather big problem in this post, Hortus used "upcoming weeks". Technically it could mean 3 things :
First choice : Hortus is wrong.
Second choice : They will release the 2.2 patch with a few bugs and fix the remaining one with hotfixes/smaller patches. 
Third and most likely choice : We won't get the patch before a few weeks, and I don't really see how they could release the 2.3 patch with Zul'aman and the 2.4 patch with the Sunwell Plateau before the expansion. Of course it could also mean that the expansion won't be released in January, but a few months later.
