Boubouille2012-10-08, 10:00 PMInk Trader Exchange Change
Beginning after the maintenance on Tuesday, October 9, ink traders will be converting from accepting Blackfallow Ink http://www.wowdb.com/items/61978 to accepting Ink of Dreams http://www.wowdb.com/items/79254 and Starlight Ink http://www.wowdb.com/items/79255 will become available for purchase. If youâ€™re still holding on to your Blackfallow Ink http://www.wowdb.com/items/61978, your time to trade it in is running short.


Vengeance Hotfix
A hotfix will be applied to adjust how Vengeance stacks for tanks of all classes:


Vengeance should now ramp up more quickly. Avoidance will now grant Vengeance based on the average damage of the avoided NPC auto-attack, instead of just refreshing existing Vengeance. This does not apply to enemy special attacks.


This will be noted in the next hotfix update, but we wanted to let you know immediately, as this change will be applied sometime today.
