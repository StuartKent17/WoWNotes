It&apos;s not really a big surprise, but I think it&apos;s the first time there is an official statement about it. Usual speculations are Diablo 3, a Starcraft MMO (after all, WoW has been released &quot;shortly&quot; after War 3), and of course a Lost Vikings MMO where dwarves will rule the world. <br>
Q: Various posts about the job applications on Blizzard&apos;s website concerning a MMO, and how it could possibly be additional manpower for WotLK<br>
A: No, it is an unannounced Next-Gen MMO. And that doesn&apos;t mean an expansion for World of Warcraft either.<br>

Virus Alert<br>
And unfortunately for us, the &#x201C;they&#x201D; in this case are thieves, and they came. It appears that the people who are distributing the latest rash of trojans paid us a visit as well. We have determined that two of the mods on the site that have auto-installers were hacked and a trojan inserted. From our investigations, it appears that the incursion was on 30 Nov. Here are the details that you need to be aware of:<br>
<br>
If you downloaded either: &quot;KaoMod-20300.001.exe&quot; or &quot;SewellUI&quot; between 30 Nov and 02 Dec, you may have been infected. <br>
<br>
What you need to do<br>
If you downloaded either of those files and think you may have been infected follow the steps on WoWInterface.com forums (http://www.wowinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=13868)<br>

Mike Morhaime interview on IncGamers<br>
IncGamers interviewed Mike Morhaime (Blizzard CEO) to get more details on the Activision / Vivendi partnership. <br>
<br>
Q: Why Activision Blizzard and not Activision Vivendi?<br>
Blizzard Entertainment is arguably one of the strongest brands in the interactive entertainment industry. Like I mentioned, we are number one in PC and online in North America, Europe, and most of Asia outside of Japan, so I think it really makes sense with it being such a strong brand that it really deserves to be in the corporate name.<br>
<br>
Q: Are there going to be any structural changes at Blizzard at all? You have stated that there won&apos;t be any changes but are things going to change behind the scenes that the Blizzard fan base are not going to see or know about?<br>
I&#x2019;ll tell you what, if I do my job properly, the players won&apos;t notice any difference.<br>
<br>
Q: Will Activision have any involvement with the day to say running of Blizzard at all?<br>
Not really. Activision is going to be focused on the Activision business. Blizzard will be focused on the Blizzard business, and of course we&apos;ll be talking to each other. I think there&apos;s a lot we can teach them about online games and certainly they run a very efficient company and I think there are things we can learn from them. <br>
<br>
Q: Is there going to be any impact on World of Warcraft subscribers? We&apos;ve seen a few threads this evening with players concerned about the product/service quality slipping and concerns about the timely release of patches. Can you reassure the players that it&apos;s business as usual at Blizzard.<br>
The management structure of Blizzard is not changing. We&apos;ve got the same people responsible for assuring quality. Our priorities have not changed. We&apos;re the same company we&apos;ve always have been. We&apos;re just allying with experience and a very successful company that has strengths in other areas. Combined, we&apos;re a stronger company, but the Blizzard Entertainment brand is going to remain unchanged, as is the Blizzard operation. Blizzard fans should not be concerned.<br>
