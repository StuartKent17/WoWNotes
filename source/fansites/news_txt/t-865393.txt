Boubouille2011-03-09, 08:44 AMPatch 4.2 - Firelands Raid Preview
Yesterday you had a sneak peek at the Firelands Daily Area , it's time to take a look at the only thing you all want to see: the Firelands Raid instance! 

Just like the daily area, it's a little hard to gather a lot of information about it because the instance isn't even supposed to be in this PTR patch but hopefully the couple of screenshots/maps below will be enough while you wait a few more months you could probably count in weeks, Patch 4.2 won't be far behind Patch 4.1 before you see it on live realms. 


Firelands Raid - Encounters
According to the Blizzcon 2010 Raids & Dungeons Panel , the Firelands raid will have 7 bosses. We already know 3 of them from achievement icones:



Fandral Staghelm , former Archdruid of Darnassus.
Alysra , the green drake in charge of transporting Fandral to a safe location at the end of the Hyjal questlines in Cataclysm. Note: Just because there's an icon related to Alysra doesn't mean it's really a boss, in the case of Valithria Dreamwalker  the goal of the encounter was to save her
Ragnaros the Firelord , that one isn't really a surprise, right? And he's so pretty now!

Live servers will have a polished zone with monsters, tons of decorative elements, etc ... Anything that moves is basically not on these screenshots.

       
       
       
       
     


PvP Video - Reckful 3
If you ever watched PvP videos you probably know who Reckful is, Reckful 3  was released yesterday and I strongly suggest that you watch it, even if you don't like PvP that much in the first place.

Blizzard Retrospective Video
If you didn't watch the Blizzard retrospective video posted on the official site yesterday because you didn't have time or didn't feel like watching it, it is now available on Youtube. I think a lot of people didn't realize it's a huge 48 minutes documentary and if you ever played a Blizzard game, you'll like it.
