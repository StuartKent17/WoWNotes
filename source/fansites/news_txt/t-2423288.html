BlizzCon Season Kicks Off with &#x201C;Best of BlizzCon&#x201D; Videos, Programming Reveals, and a Bonus Blizzard Infographic<br>
Every BlizzCon is a piece of Blizzard Entertainment history. It&#x2019;s a unique opportunity for us at Blizzard to geek out about our shared passion for games with our community and reveal what we&#x2019;ve been working on with everyone. It&#x2019;s also where our community comes to experience and help create unforgettable moments that last a lifetime.<br>
<br>
This year, we&#x2019;re kicking off BlizzCon season with a few firsts. We&#x2019;ve created the &#x201C;Blizzard Community Spotlight 2018&#x201D; infographic, highlighting stats and fun facts about our players and what they do in and outside of our games, and with a few eye-popping facts about what goes into making BlizzCon a spectacle. We&#x2019;ve also created a video campaign that lets all of you relive and vote on your favorite moments from BlizzCons past.<br>
<br>
Then of course there&#x2019;s this upcoming BlizzCon, which everyone will be able to follow via Virtual Ticket. Today, we&#x2019;re giving the first glimpse of what&#x2019;s to come when BlizzCon and Virtual Ticket 2018 programming kicks off in three weeks with the &#x201C;BlizzCon All-Access Kick-Off Show.&#x201D; Jump to the &#x201C;Save the Dates&#x201D; section at the bottom if you can&#x2019;t wait to see what&#x2019;s coming up.<br>
