The official patch notes have been updated to reflect the changes from the latest build. <br>
<br>
Arenas<br>
Beginning with season 7, players will no longer have access to the newest season&apos;s weapons or shoulder armor and will not qualify for the Gladiator title/rewards with ratings from the 2v2 bracket alone. Ratings obtained through 3v3 and 5v5 game play will be required for these rewards, while the rest of the newest season&apos;s items will remain available to players in all brackets (standard rating restrictions still apply).<br>
<br>
Items: General<br>
Resilience: No longer reduces the amount of damage done by damage-over-time spells, but instead reduces the amount of all damage done by players by the same proportion. In addition, the amount of resilience needed to reduce critical strike chance, critical strike damage and overall damage has been increased by 15%.<br>

Flying Machine: The level requirement needed to learn how to build and use this machine has been reduced to level 60, down from level 70, and the engineering skill level reduced to 300, down from 350. Material costs reduced.<br>

Requires level 68. <br>
Val&apos;anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings: This item&apos;s stats and level have been increased to match the power level of healer weapons coming from the Coliseum 25-person normal difficulty instance. In addition, each time Val&apos;anyr is equipped, Blessing of Ancient Kings will be placed on a 45-second cooldown before it can occur.<br>
<br>
Isle of Conquest Changes - 07.10<br>
The following changes have been made to Isle of Conquest. Some of these changes may appear in the build going live today, while others might not make it in until the next build.<br>
<br>
Added a new powerful AoE attack to the Generals.<br>
Added bonus honor for destroying a gate (note: this honor is only given out once when the first gate is destroyed. Destroying additional gates does not grant additional honor).<br>
Increased the range of the Flame Turrets on the Siege Engines.<br>
Decreased the starting reinforcement count from 400 to 300.<br>
Achievements for the zone should all work correctly now.<br>
Fixed a bug that could cause the Keep Cannons to be unable to be repaired and despawn.<br>
Fixed a bug that was causing the alliance gate to not have collision at the start<br>
Lowered the movement speed of the glaive thrower (again).</div></div>
