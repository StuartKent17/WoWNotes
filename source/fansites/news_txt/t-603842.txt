Boubouille2007-12-15, 05:52 AMThe PTRs are now online, the Feast of Winter Veil just started, and there is a Call To Arms for Eye of the Storm. I guess it will be a busy week end for all players. 

PTR Testing
As you probably know, PTRs are up and running. Some of you aren't used to PTR testing and it looks like it's a good time to do a small recap.

2. All patches
I didn't take the time to test all of them mostly because I don't have any esES/deDE/frFR client installed, but they're all from the Blizzard downloader and should work without problem if I didn't do something stupid during the download. Let me know if something isn't working.

2.3.2 Information
They're available in the 2.3.2 Compilation http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=2506.0, I guess you're used to it now.

Latest updates
Warlock Seed of Corruption bug
Servers have been restarted to deal with the Seed of Corruption bug allowing Warlocks to insta kill pretty much everything. All existing warlocks need to re-train all their spells from a trainer. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3466327047&postId=34658352040&sid=1#0

Honour Calculations bug
Issuntril posted a list of the main factors which can cause a difference between your honour estimate in your character window, and the amount awarded daily.
There is a difference between the honour really won and the estimated honour gain in the PvP tab of your character window. This difference is due to a display problem. The honour won is the correct amount. The estimated honour display tends to show a higher value for these three reasons.

1. The amount of honour given by the daily PvP quest is accurate. But due to a display issue, once the quest is turned in, if you zone into an instance, arena, battleground, etc., the honour display will have gone up without reason generally between 400 and 600 points but sometimes more.

2. Killing another player several times gets you diminishing returns. Each subsequent kill after the initial kill yields 10% less honour, until the reward eventually reaches zero. Note that the Honour calculations that appear in-game do not take these diminishing returns into account.

3. The daily calculation that computes the honour gained runs during the night sometime between midnight and 2 AM. But your character is only updated if you quit the game or are disconnected. Thus, if you play at the same time as the calculation is running and you quit the game after the script is over, the honour points you won will be accurately calculated but your estimated honour points will display as zero, even if you have won honour in the time lapse between the script has finished running and you quit the game. Those honour points are although taken into account and will be added to your usable honour points total the next day.

All these reasons explain the difference between honour gained and honour estimated. Rest assured the honour you win is always accurately calculated.

Other blue posts
The new realm in Europe was a success actually, people are already experiencing a nice queue on it, and trial accounts are getting another "nerf" because of botters.
Trial account changes
Trial accounts may no longer invite players to a party. They can still, however; accept invites from subscriber accounts who they may wish to group with. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3409893556&postId=33543417226&sid=1#0

[EU] Molten Core realm
Due to a very high number of migrations to Molten Core the migration from Stonemaul and Warsong will be closed tomorrow, Saturday December 15th at 10:00 CET.

If it turns out people continue migrating even more before it closes, and the realm fills even more and the queues don't go away, we'll consider opening migration the other way most likely to Stonemaul, as that's where we see most players move from for a day or two next week. Please note that this is a consideration to be made, not something guaranteed. We definitely take over-filling a destination very seriously though, and will do what we can to address it.

Also note that AQ40 Gates will be opened automatically and very soon since this is a realm populated with people from realms with the gates already open Source http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=1958406491&postId=19576515154&sid=1#12
