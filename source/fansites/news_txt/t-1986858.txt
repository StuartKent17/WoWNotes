Legendary Item Effects in PvP
Your understanding is correct. They will be disabled in all PvP instances, including unrated battlegrounds. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/409422-will-legendary-effects-be-disabled-in-unrated-bgs/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743394515?page=1#2

World Quest Icons
Skull Rare Elite WQs are Dungeon World Quests, requiring a dungeon group.

Sounds like this iconography isn't particularly self-explanatory though, will pass that along to the UI guys. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/409314-simple-question-for-devs-about-world-quests/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743314522?page=1#7

Order Hall Resources and Upgrades
So the point is that you you guys thought this would be the end all be all resource dump since there really aren't any compelling rewards? Honestly I wish the team would've just decided to unlock the upgrades through quests rather than currency. Or am I missing some information?
The primary source of Order Hall Resources is doing quests. We'll be laying out the details of Legion's endgame structure as we get closer to release - it feels premature to publish a blog on the subject while we're still iterating on exactly how all the pieces fit together, as well as tuning. But Legion has at least as much max-level outdoor content as Mists of Pandaria did, except with a different structure world quests complemented by one-time story moments that lets us offer more player choice and day-to-day variation, to avoid some of the pitfalls of Mists, where we heard player feedback about repetition and burnout.

As for the subject of the thread, yeah, as Muffinus noted above, this is one of many different perks that you can unlock or not, and is intended to offer a small time-saving convenience. If anything, it may end up being undesirable because of its limitations, and we wouldn't be willing to buff it to the point where it'd be truly "strong" because that would cut directly against the value, expressed many times here in this discussion, of actually going out and adventuring. We'll see how it plays out in further testing.

Holy Paladin Feedback -- Build 21531 -- 21-Apr
Tuning is still early and right now is drifting around a lot, as unrelated changes happen without necessarily being compensated for in terms of tuning. Looks like H Pal DPS is somewhat lower than other healers in this build possibly largely due to the loss of Holy Bolt; we'll bring it up next build so it's in the ballpark before more detailed tuning happens.

Blue Tweets
The Broken Shore
soz just salty about how the alliance keeps getting boned it looks like
you should wait for the Horde's side to pass judgement Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720427372336447488

seriously, da fuq? Why cant it be the Alliance that fuqs up? Its always the horde.
Things are not always as one side sees them. The Horde may have a different perspective on how things went down at the end. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720419643278516225

Racials
Arcane Torrent being on the GCD is a bug, and will be fixed in the next Alpha update. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/720686270049943552

Classes
During the Demon Hunter early access, will we be able to explore Azeroth and maybe level profs before the expansion hits?
During the pre-launch, you will be able to take your demon hunter wherever you please. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720681929012486144

Realm Hopping
Any plans to stop people from 'realm-hopping' into raids trying to form then leaving at once?
We realize it’s a major nuisance and we’re investigating solutions. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/720761664853782528

BMAH
Why is the Black market in Dalaran? the whole point of BMAH is its supposed to be in a dangerous unsafe area? now zero threat.
Oh, but the Dalaran Underbelly is a hive of scum and villainy. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/720760181122928640

Artifact Weapons
Is it intentional that Artifact Relics cannot be removed from the Artifact once they've been placed?
Yes. Relics will be replaced primarily on the basis of item level; they’re not meant to be Glyphs 2.0. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/720763957858861056

PvP
I love world pvp, I hate FFA arenas though. Why most of them? This game wasn't designed around 1v1.
FFA is about as far from 1v1 as you can get Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720425492763922432
Then in that case it's just PvP guilds hoarding them, or waiting till 3 AM just to have a shot.
Some options to consider: no grouping full FFA, limited groups max 5 man, buffing solo-ers. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720469173047058432
Most times I see groups of friends at FFA making it so that only their friend wins. Which isn't fun
We're gonna make world PvP work here, please keep up the feedback! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720476399610568704
