The Scroll of Resurrection Retires<br>
The time has come to bid adieu to the Scroll of Resurrection. It&#x2019;s served its divine purpose, but like most scrolls, it only has so many charges before it loses its magic and crumbles into ethereal dust. For those who&#x2019;d still like a chance to use the scroll, you have until February 18 before players are no longer able to send invitations. For those who have an invitation outstanding, that&#x2019;s still good for 30 days from the time it was sent, after which point the invitation will expire and the benefits can no longer be claimed.<br>
<br>
