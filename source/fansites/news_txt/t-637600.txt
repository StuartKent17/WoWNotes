Ulduar - Flame Leviathan Testing
Boss Information
Health - 20M 10-Man / 62M 25-Man

Every 30 seconds he will switch targets to another siege vehicle, mark them, and follow them around. If you do not have two siege vehicles active then he will pick a different unit.

He has a soft enrange due to Gathering Speed. You have to kite him, thanks to Battering Ram, and it becomes harder and harder to get away from him even with help from Steam Rush.

Flame Jets http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=62396: Inflicts 2000 Fire damage to enemies around the caster. 50 yard range. Interruptable. 
Battering Ram http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=62376: a melee range attack, Rams the target, dealing damage and knocking it forward. Debuffs them with "Battering Ram": Damage taken increased by 100%. 
Gathering Speed http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=62375: periodically he moves a bit faster by gaining another stack of this buff. The stack is reset when he is stunned by Overload Circuit. 
He also fires rockets constantly at the raid, doing about 700 damage each time they land about once every 1-2 seconds 
He has 4 turrets. Passengers in the demolisher can be launched at him where they can destroy the turrets and then hit the Overload Circuit http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=62399: stuns Flame Leviathan and causes him to take 50% more damage for 10 seconds.
