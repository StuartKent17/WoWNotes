Pack Spirit’s healing reduced to 25% when engaged in combat with enemy players was 50%.

Developers' note: These can have a much higher uptime in PvP combat compared to the rest of the game resulting in a larger than intended amount of healing. As a result, we’re further reducing their effect in PvP. These changes were intended to be included in the Rise of Azshara content update notes and have been live since its release.
