Trial of the Crusader - Updated Test Schedule<br>
Here&apos;s the current schedule for Trial of the Crusader PTR testing:<br>
<br>
On the European test realms:<br>
<br>
Faction Champions - Saturday Night, July 11, starting at 19:00 CEST.<br>
<br>
The issues that were preventing raid testing on the North American PTRs are still not fully resolved. We&apos;re looking into alternative means of enabling testing on these realms. I&apos;ll update this thread when I have more information.<br>
<br>
Note that only the 10 Player and 25 Player difficulties will be available on PTR. The Heroic versions will not be available. If you are usually part of raids that easily crushes Ulduar Hard Modes, you should find the non-Heroic difficulties to be not difficult.<br>
<br>
Koralon the Flame Watcher is also available to be tested in the Vault of Archavon depending on PTR Wintergrasp status.<br>
<br>
Test Patchwerks (Tank and DPS versions) will also be available in the Argent Coliseum during similar times to other bosses. Instead of the previous tank test patchwerk that increased melee damage over time, the 3.2 tank test patchwerk will just hit VERY hard (as hard as Algalon) all the time to allow for more lengthy sustained tank parses. We&apos;re always interested in seeing combat logs and parses for all raid testing on the PTR, but especially test patchwerk logs. These are extremely helpful to our class team.<br>
<br>
This schedule could change at a moment&apos;s notice due to server, bug, or patch status. I&apos;ll try to keep everyone informed as much as possible. The Trial of the Crusader and the bosses to be tested will remain also open a variable length of time. How long they stay open depends upon a host of factors including designer availability, bug status, etc. These bosses are very much a work in progress, and this is a test server.<br>
