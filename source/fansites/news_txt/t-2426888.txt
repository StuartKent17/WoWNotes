Mythic Plus Battle for Azeroth Season 1 Live Todaymythicpluschanges
Mythic Plus dungeons are now available! Completing a +10 will get you the highest item level loot for your weekly chest next reset! Blizzard has continued to build upon the Mythic Plus system for Battle for Azeroth, adding in some changes!


You can no longer swap gear while in a Mythic Plus dungeon.
Mythic Plus will now have seasons much like PvP. This includes seasonal achievements such as Battle for Azeroth Keystone Conqueror: Season One https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13079-battle-for-azeroth-keystone-conqueror-season-one and Battle for Azeroth Keystone Master: Season One https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13080-battle-for-azeroth-keystone-master-season-one.
These seasons will also feature seasonal affixes. Season One will have Infested https://www.wowdb.com/affixes/16-infested.
Tyrannical https://www.wowdb.com/affixes/9-tyrannical and Fortified https://www.wowdb.com/affixes/10-fortified are now Keystone Level 2 affixes, meaning every Mythic Plus dungeon will contain one or the other.
Your weekly Mythic + chest can now contain up to 3 pieces of gear.



PvP Brawl - Warsong Scramble
Every other week a new PvP Brawl will be available to players looking for something just a little different. Each Brawl will offer a variety of modes, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay, and you’ll find them in the Group Finder tool hotkey “I” in the Player vs. Player tab. Just like Random Battlegrounds, you’ll receive a reward for achieving victory. 

Warsong Scramble – Capture the Flag
Do you have a flag? Warsong Gulch has always been the scene of an epic Capture the Flag battle, but what happens when you can capture your enemy’s flag without your own at base? Find out when you step into this PvP Brawl! We’ve also added a few more power-ups to the field of battle to stir things up a bit. To win, your team will need to be the first to capture 5 flags.
