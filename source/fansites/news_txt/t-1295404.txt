Patch 5.3 - Dungeon Journal UI
Patch 5.3 finally makes it faster to move through the Dungeon Journal by putting boss selections for an instance on the left always, and loot, abilities, and model on the right, making it much faster to switch between bosses to find the right loot list.

Otis - Dungeon Journal Addon
If you don't want to wait a few weeks for Patch 5.3, you can install the Otis addon http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/otis to make life a little bit easier. It adds arrows to the side of the Dungeon Journal that allows you to quickly move up and down through the boss list.

Blue Tweets
Character
I'd say Glyphs and Talents look too similar atm.
Yeah, I think that's fair criticism. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329390939359555584

We added talents in vanilla so rogue 1 and rogue 2 could be different. With tri spec, what if every rogue feels the same again? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329314508231290881
I think you picked the worst class to make an example for you here.
In my experience, hunters are even more likely to swap specs than rogues. Even rogue specs have more kit than hunter specs. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329396445436317696

Pandora's box was open at the moment you allowed us to change spec unlimited number of times.
Then maybe we need to close the box. Another idiom is throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330064371646615554

Can you reconcile your tweet yesterday about yr friend being "just a druid" w/ the "Bring the player not the class" mentality?
I don't think it's a contradiction. You should be able to bring a Balance or Feral most of the time. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330063854128230400
Now there are some cases where we discourage extreme ranged or melee stacking, which is more necessary evil than cool design. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330064055622565888

And how about "bring player - not spec" argument?
Unless you are on heroic Lei Shen, you can probably play any spec you want and be fine. This was not the case in Sunwell. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330063019784695810
In Sunwell, you had to stack certain classes to get the right buff / debuff matrix. That is what "bring the player" was all about. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330063157752131584

How much would you like Crit, Haste and Mastery to be just as good as one another for all specs, allowing freedom for style?
It's tricky. If they are all interchangeable, then you don't look at the stats at all. Better would be if you can feel the delta. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330062615797719040
For some casters, you can really feel diff between a high crit and high haste build. I wish it felt more so for everyone. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330062725193543682
Then the stats could be equal value while the decision was still meaningful. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330062781573369856

I was looking at simulation numbers on noxxic. Can't believe I'm alone in thinking it's demotivating to see my class so low.
We don't put much faith in class comparisons from sims. Different people with different skills work on the various components. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330443052009275392
So even if e.g. the hunter simming is strong, it may not mesh with the shaman simming. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330443160398475264
Sims are better for helping you determine gems, rotations, reforge etc. for your character. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330443257228189696

PvE
Can we get a heads up as to VP incoming patch, will it be reset or can I have it stored ready?
We will give you notification before 5.3 ships. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330445237279420417

Sunwell raids stacked the top DPS with 1 each of the buff classes. Heroic ToT is the same except it's Raid CDs now.
Disagree. Heroic ToT class stacking is nothing like Sunwell class stacking. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330406718657925122

This is opposite of truth. Having the highest ilvl possible when stepping into ANY raid IS MANDATORY
I disagree. Skill has a much greater impact than ilevel. That is why Blood Legion can beat content with very little new gear. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329762859645030400
Worldclass is irrelevant. There'd be no point to gear if it didn't facilitate success. Stop with the straw man.
But skill matters more than gear especially for non-worldclass, because the worldclass can't improve their skill much more. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330055757594767362
Gear helps for sure. If you want to farm LFR for tiny DPS upgrades, go for it. My contention is that behavior is optional. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330055570600128513
mechanics or not the guild rollling in a sub 496 ilvl is gonna have a bad time in tot where the 515 guys are gonna breeze
Yes, that is different. If you don't have a lot of N gear from previous tier, then LFR will serve as a useful catchup. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330079596965941248

why is it we can burn extra mogu coins in LFR but not on nalak for example?
We didn't want to encourage rampant realm hopping, which can lead to instability when there are too many folks in one spot. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330059425085804546
Now that 5.2 has been out for awhile, it would probably be okay for the older bosses. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330059498163159040

have you consider make DBM as default UI, like many other popular 3rd party UIs they are becoming essentials
We try to communicate essential info in raids. The raid mods often provide too much info, which has 2 problems. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329755056725434368
Difficulty is probably obvious, but they also make fights seem complicated by bringing your attention to stuff you could ignore. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329755569437155328

I have even seen in blue posts where you or someone else says normal raiders run LFR! Pls get stories straight!!!
Some heroic raiders run LFR. The question is how forced they feel to do so. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329760895804784640
In 5.0 when everyone was in blues, LFR gave epics and felt really important. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329761121957457920
In 5.2, LFR offers much less to N raiders unless you've been unlucky or are impatient to complete a set or something. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329761270549069824
As I've said, if it's fun for you, go for it. I wouldn't consider it mandatory though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329761437834702849
In heroic, there are tight enrage timers. In 5.2, there really aren't in normal. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329761527118831617
It comes down to your error rate on mechanics. Improving ilevel can gives you more room to have more errors and still win. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329761797718540288
But causing fewer errors in the first place is likely an even surer track to victory. gives -> give Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329762024735244292

don't you fear pve gear will become too strong and scare away pure pvpers who dont want to pve?
We don't think PvE gear will be more attractive than PvP gear for PvP with these changes. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329753894668365825

the blog about how to gear was a little inelegant and convoluted let's say. Is End game gearing gonna be like that forever?
What we don't like is that the current system is fairly opaque. Nothing tells you "Go here for a good belt upgrade." Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330442690971975682
Also, the system gets more convoluted when tiers advance. Should I do MV LFR or ToT LFR? Is the DMF trinket still good? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330442840310165504
We like to encourage lots of different paths towards a goal rather than e.g. raid or die. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330442584164032512
what if i just want to raid or die? All I want to do is dungeon and rad? Why can't that be an optimal choice? Not the only one
Optimal tends to become the only. We try to make the most optimal path the most diverse one but again not the only one. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330445478024081408

Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/may/ssdgraph.gif seem to be moving back up slowly, with almost all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. No new GPUs or SSDs worth waiting for are expected before the third quarter this year. RAM prices have been increasing for the past few months, so if you were thinking about adding RAM anytime soon, now is the time.

The new Haswell CPUs from Intel are almost here and should bring a mild performance improvement, power usage reduction, and significantly better integrated graphics. 

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 3770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx and Nvidia http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/290-Computer for any extra questions!
