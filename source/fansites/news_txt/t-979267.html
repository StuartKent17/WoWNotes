We have seen half of the new Tier 13 sets now, but it is likely that the rest won&apos;t be added daily (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/198238/tier-13#post126).<br>

Reminder: Firelands Raid Changes Incoming<br>
Don&apos;t forget about the nerfs that go in to effect this week!<br>
With the final showdown against Deathwing approaching, we&#x2019;ve been keeping a close eye on players&apos; progress through the current Firelands raid content. Before patch 4.3 is released, we want groups who are working on Heroic-difficulty content to be able to get as close to Ragnaros as possible, and we want players who are tackling normal progression to be able to experience as many of the encounters as they can. To achieve these goals, we&#x2019;ll be toning down the difficulty of both normal and Heroic raids through hotfixes in the coming weeks. In general, we plan to reduce health and damage of all raid bosses in both normal and Heroic Firelands by around the same percentage we brought difficulty down for the original Cataclysm raids when Rage of the Firelands (patch 4.2) was released.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re looking forward to seeing more groups of players face off against the Fire Lord in the weeks ahead. However, before we make these changes, we want to give everyone a final shot at the bosses at their current difficulty level -- so this is a heads up that we&#x2019;re planning to apply the difficulty hotfixes beginning the week of September 19.<br>
<br>
Stay tuned to the Patch 4.2 Hotfixes blog for these and other live updates to the game as they happen.<br>
