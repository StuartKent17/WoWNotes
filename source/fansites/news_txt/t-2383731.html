Hotfix - Pantheon Trinket Drops Obey Loot Spec<br>
Blizzard made Pantheon Trinket (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/pantheon-trinkets/) drops after the first always obey your loot spec. <br>
Hey guys! Just wanted to follow up with this since there was quite a bit of discussion and some really good feedback on how the Epic Pantheon Trinkets are awarded. Recently we&apos;ve pushed forward a change before this current reset.<br>
<br>
The Pantheon trinkets for drops after the first now obey your loot specializations. Previously it only followed your loot specialization for the first one and the second was random for your other specs. <br>
<br>
Appreciate all of the feedback you guys have been giving us about this!<br>

Mythic Dungeon Invitational: Prepping for the Time Trials<br>
With the Proving Grounds of the Mythic Dungeon Invitational (MDI) wrapping up, we wanted to share more information on the next stage of the event, the MDI Time Trials!<br>
<br>
Everything You Need to Know About MDI Time Trials<br>
For last year&#x2019;s first Mythic Dungeon Invitational, only the top 8 teams were invited to take part in the next stage. This year, we&#x2019;re allowing even more teams to compete for their share of the $200,000 global prize pool. All eligible teams who complete the MDI Proving Grounds will receive an invitation to the Tournament Realms, which are specifically configured realms for the next stage of the tournament. All players will have access to the same top-end gear to equip their character and prove that they have what it takes to be crowned as the global Mythic Dungeon Invitational champions.<br>
<br>
What are the Time Trials?<br>
Kicking off Tuesday, March 27, the Time Trials is a way for us to judge the overall skill, expertise, and flexibility of teams as they tackle three dungeons across different difficulties. Some teams are good at pushing high keys, or surviving nasty affixes, or maybe they&#x2019;ve mastered a single dungeon. But in the MDI, teams need to have all these skills to thrive and make it to the top.<br>
<br>
Dungeon 1 - Maw of Souls +20<br>
<br>
Bursting<br>
Quaking<br>
Fortified<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeon 2 - Upper Karazhan +22<br>
<br>
Raging<br>
Explosive<br>
Tyrannical<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeon 3 - Neltharion&apos;s Lair +24<br>
<br>
Sanguine<br>
Grievous<br>
Fortified<br>
<br>
<br>
These three dungeons will be the sole focus for teams during the week of Time Trials and all teams will have unlimited tries on the Tournament Realm to refine and master these dungeons.<br>
<br>
Just completing the dungeons in time won&#x2019;t be enough and teams will need to push themselves to see how fast they can run each of the dungeons. We&#x2019;ll compile each team&#x2019;s fastest time on each dungeon and add all three times together for their Time Trials score. Only the top 8 scores for each region move onto the Regional Bracket stage, so expect teams to be fiercely competitive to stay on top of the pack.<br>
<br>
Make sure you submit your scores (https://mythicdungeoninvitational.wufoo.com/forms/m154hh9q1s6vx23/) from the Proving Grounds period. All entries must be received by March 16 by 3:00 p.m. PDT. Only dungeons completed during the Proving Ground period will be considered.<br>

Voice Acted Quests Shut Down<br>
Recently, TioMiklas (https://www.mmo-champion.com/members/1434487-TioMiklas) started a community driven add-on project called Voice Acted Quests (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2381319-We-need-your-help-voicing-all-wow-quests), which called for players to become voice actors for the quests in World of Warcraft. The addon played audio of the quest dialogue over the quest text and was voiced by members of the WoW community. The project was gaining steam, but has met the same fate as Bellular (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwiaPYufmQOq5F1TI-FzQhw)&apos;s Warcraft Tales project and was shut down by Blizzard (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm7h49s3NDI).<br>
Hello TioMiklas,<br>
<br>
I&#x2019;m Josh Allen, from the World of Warcraft Community Team. We came across your Voice Acted Quests project, and I have to say, the work you&#x2019;ve put into it is very impressive!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I&#x2019;ve been told that this project infringes on our intellectual copyrights in a way that we can&#x2019;t allow. You may recall a similar situation with an addon called &#x201C;Warcraft Tales&#x201D; a few months ago. While your project is slightly different, it&#x2019;s still considered a re-performance of our established works.<br>
<br>
Because of that, we have to ask you to stop production and distribution of the Voice Acted Quests project. Rather than going straight to delivering a legal notice, they&#x2019;ve asked me to contact you directly to deliver the news and answer any questions you may have. Like I said, it&#x2019;s a very impressive project and we recognize the amount of work you&#x2019;ve put into it, it&#x2019;s just not the sort of thing we can allow to be created using our copyright.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the bad news.<br>
<br>
Hey again, sorry for the delay in getting back. I managed to sync up with the higher-ups here again with your questions.<br>
<br>
The issue isn&apos;t about any potential monetary gains. The issue is simply that Blizzard doesn&apos;t want third parties to create in-game story content for WoW, and creating a vocal performance for existing lines falls inside that. No one here thinks you&#x2019;re trying to be malicious &#x2013; I&#x2019;m being completely honest when I say we found your work impressive!<br>
<br>
That&#x2019;s about the extent of what I can comment on myself. Anything further would need to come from our legal team. <br>
<br>

Polygon&apos;s Warcraft Chronicle Volume 3 Preview<br>
Polygon (https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/9/17093986/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-chronicle-3) took a quick look at Warcraft Chronicle Volume 3 (https://amzn.to/2FsgbTA) as well including a chapter that was not on the Amazon Prime Preview (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7429-World-of-Warcraft-Chronicle-Volume-3-Preview-Blue-Posts-Allcraft-Curse-Hiring).<br>

Snakes Sneak into Spring Finals from North America Cup 3<br>
With the Spring Finals on the horizon and Europe&#x2019;s top four decided, teams from North America duked it out in the third AWC North American Cup. With Method Orange flying high after success in the second N.A. cup, their spot at the Spring Finals live event seemed guaranteed, leaving four teams in the region to battle for three spots.<br>
<br>
The third North American cup was a story of upsets with Super Frogs not even making the top 8 and Method Orange stumbling early and falling to the lower bracket against Tilted. In what was a huge match for seeding in the Spring Finals, The Rejects, with 120 points this season, swept Method Black, who sat on 140 points, leaving both teams on the cusp of the fourth Spring Finals spot. In the upper bracket semifinals, The Rejects set themselves up for a Spring Finals berth with a 3-1 win over Fairly Caustic. On the other side, Tilted beat Sneakier Snakes in a tight 3-2 match to advance to the upper bracket finals. In the lower bracket, Method Orange went past Fairly Caustic with ease and Method Black fell to Sneakier Snakes.Snakes then eliminated the regional heavyweights 3-1 with the split pressure from the Jungle Cleave too much for Method Orange to handle.<br>

<br>
In the upper bracket finals, The Rejects managed to get past Tilted 3-1 thanks to the burst damage from their Rogue/Shaman composition. In the lower bracket, Sneakier Snakes and Tilted set up a rematch with a spot in the cup final and a chance at the Spring Finals on the line. The series went the way of the Snakes 3-1 setting up a grand final against The Rejects with a high seed at the Spring Finals going to the winner. In the end, the damage from Sneakier Snakes&#x2019; Jungle Cleave was too much for The Rejects to handle and it was a quick sweep for the Snakes. With that win, Sneakier Snakes&#x2019; booked their spot into the Spring Finals and look to be going into the Spring Finals with all the momentum.<br>
<br>
With the four teams from North America set&#x2014;Method Orange, The Rejects, Super Frogs, and Sneakier Snakes&#x2014;the field of teams for the Spring Finals is complete. Looking ahead to the Spring Finals, Sneakier Snakes are the in-form team but Method Orange have been the more dominant team from North America and are the team looking to make their mark internationally in 2018. The Spring Finals should be a stylistic matchup too, as the RMP that seems to be more prevalent in Europe will face off against the more aggressive Jungle Cleave and Windwalker/Death Knight compositions from North America.<br>
<br>
All style battles and bragging rights will be decided at the Spring Finals beginning March 31.<br>
