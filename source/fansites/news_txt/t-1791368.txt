Blue Tweets
PvE
Personal Loot; The sad part is the amount of duplicate loots you get with it, if you could do something to that it would be better
That's kinda just loot in general though, it's been that way since forever, in most RPGs. Muffinus 

Will the 6.2 Personal Loot changes apply to LFR and world bosses or just premade groups?
Yes to Raid Finder, but no plans for world bosses at this time. WarcraftDevs 

are mythic dungeons going to be cross-realm?
Yes. WarcraftDevs 

Garrisons
My eternally broken pet menagerie. 6.2 adding some awesome new pet battle content and my enthusiasm is rock bottom thanks to it.
.We've been looking into a few of these issues in 6.2, if you can't get your menagerie working, please let me know! Muffinus 

.Garrison missions for oil on the PTR seem really scarce... intended? Haven't seen one for 3 days
Intended. Missions will not be your main source of Oil, just a rare bonus opportunity. WarcraftDevs 

Misc
MMO Designer: What exactly do you want? Every player: TO ANNOY OTHER PEOPLE LOL Muffinus 

I'm just a dude, with a twitter, but I would very much like to hear what you think isn't being heard. I hear "not listening" a lot. Muffinus 
Often report bugs I find in models. Reports I make dating 2 years ago seem to go unnoticed or low priority. 
The WoW DB has nearly 450,000 bugs total in its lifetime. Would like to fix every one timely, sometimes not possible, but recorded! Muffinus 
Example: only recently did a bug get fixed where you are removed from your warrior stance when entering C'thun's stomach Muffinus 

At a certain point, you can't make a game and not care what the audience thinks. Every post or comment is taken to heart. Muffinus 
Can you name anyone else at Blizzard that cares about what we think? Since you brought it up.
Everyone. The WC books on the shelf behind me are so worn because so many new designers have read them all. Muffinus 

the sad part is that there will always be those that, no matter how much you listen, will say you're not listening
Such is the nature of social media The ability to yell at someone anytime, anywhere, about the lack of an Annoy-O-Tron pet. Muffinus 
I think you're all listening, you just have a design philosophy that I disagree with but I understand it, I think
I don't know if you disagree with me, or the design team, but go ahead and tell me more! Muffinus 

your problem is that you asked what they want. just make the awesome game and ignore every1 else
Often, making "awesome" in a vacuum results in the realization that it's not so great for someone else Muffinus 

People are heard, they are just not told "we heard you but... yay or nay" back. So they don't know.
It's difficult to respond with a community of this size, even with a community team. A challenge! Muffinus 

mobile content. I feel like there's just a TON of missed opportunities to have mobile games that tie into the mmo gameplay.
Hearthstone did awesome. I think there is still significant meaning in being a Blizzard product. Thus, need to be careful. Muffinus 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs  appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
PvP
I'm not sure if you can answer this or not but as a pvper, I'm curious. How much weight did PvP balance actually play in WoW?
A lot. In some sense if you tune a game around PvP, the PvE can flow from that. Monsters don't mind getting nerfed. OccupyGStreet 
PvP is harder to test though. Fighting a boss 10 times is a decent sample size. It's nothing for a PvP match. OccupyGStreet 

Amount of Content
Very curious as to your take on Watcher's interview.
Ion's a good friend of mine. I'm not about to throw him under the bus. OccupyGStreet 
No bus here, just curiosity. Do you think "it's cyclical" is a good or even fair way to summate it tho?
Yes. Players come for content and leave when they run out. "But I should never run out of content," feels unrealistic to me. OccupyGStreet 
I do think / know the challenges of creating content faster than players can consume it are very real. OccupyGStreet 
Neverending content leads to making things so difficult you can't progress or asking you to run the same content 100 times. OccupyGStreet 
Is there something to be said for the staying power of the content? Or implementing it in a way that allows for a medium?
If there were 40 boss raids, maybe. I get tired of killing the same ones over and over no matter how great they are. OccupyGStreet 
Like the PvP content WoW neglects? Is your current job not 100% repeatable content now?
IMO repeatable content is a PvE construct. PvP has a lot of variation because of the players involved. OccupyGStreet 
We do add new content, champions being the prime example, but there is less of a burden on a PvP game, again IMO. OccupyGStreet 

Heroes of the Storm
hi what do you think about heros of the strom compare to LoL?
I think they are wisely going for a different kind of moba which makes sense in a crowded market. OccupyGStreet 
I think they have a chance to broaden the moba audience, which may be good for everyone. OccupyGStreet
