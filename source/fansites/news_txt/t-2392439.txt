Armor as DPS specs
What's up with the armor scaling for dps specs? My shaman who should normally have 30-40% phys reduction from armor, apparently has only 10% in BfA right now.
That looks like a tooltip bug in the "against current enemy" line--it appears to be showing your mitigation against a 120 in all the cases you're seeing here. You should indeed expect to see a number slightly higher than than the number in the first line, when targeting a -1 level enemy. The 25% you're seeing in the first line is in the right ballpark for a mail-wearer against a par enemy subject to the exact items you have on, etc..

As far as taking a lot of damage while questing, that could be either:
1 It's not just a tooltip bug and perhaps you are actually taking damage as though the attacker was 120. We'll have to look into that.
2 We're all used to questing in endgame gear on live, so it's a big shift to go back to questing in quest gear, where the enemies are a better match for you. Fighting 3 standard outdoor mobs at once is the sort of thing that should have a chance of killing you.

Brewmaster - Stagger
I agree with this - it should be clear what the default stagger percentage is. This should be added to the Character Pane.
No promises yet, but the character sheet is a possible solution we might try here. Because Stagger now uses a more complex calculation akin to armor, it's difficult to present it in a tooltip. For the moment, the salient points are:

1 You want Agility to drive the value of Stagger, similarly to how all tanks now want Strength/Agility to make sure their armor/AM keeps up with content they're tanking.

2 In current alpha, with par gear against the content you're fighting, Stagger amounts are similar to what they'd been before the change 40% baseline, 70% when you have Ironskin Brew up, etc..

Soothing Mist
1 Just to say it, sorry about the confusion where we said we were going fix a bug with mobile Soothing Mist and then wound up removing it this build. We made the latter decision a few days later. Briefly--with Soothing Mist changing so much between Legion and BFA, the impact of mobile Soothing would have gone from "a small filler heal can be cast while moving" to "all 5 of your core heals can now be cast while moving." The latter is something we avoid on healers.

2 Any details on ReM overwriting itself would be good. It should not be trying to jump unless there is an injured target that doesn't already have your Renewing Mist on them.

Before the Storm Novel Description Updated
Krainz noticed https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/8dqrvd/prediction_this_faction_war_will_be_concluded/ that Christie Golden's upcoming novel Before the Storm http://amzn.to/2ywUb30 has an updated description. You can see the previous description here https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7156-Before-the-Storm-Delayed-Developer-Interviews-Blue-Tweets-DLC-607.
Azeroth is dying.

The Horde and the Alliance defeated the demonic Burning Legion, but a dire catastrophe is unfolding deep below the surface of the world. There is a mortal wound in the heart of Azeroth, struck by the sword of the fallen titan Sargeras in a final act of cruelty.

For Anduin Wrynn, king of Stormwind, and Sylvanas Windrunner, warchief of the Horde and queen of the Forsaken, there is little time to rebuild what remains and even less to mourn what was lost. Azeroth’s devastating wound has revealed a mysterious material known as Azerite. In the right hands, this strange golden substance is capable of incredible feats of creation; in the wrong ones, it could bring forth unthinkable destruction.

As Alliance and Horde forces race to uncover the secrets of Azerite and heal the wounded world, Anduin enacts a desperate plan aimed at forging a lasting peace between the factions. Azerite jeopardizes the balance of power, and so Anduin must gain the trust of Sylvanas. But, as ever, the Dark Lady has her own machinations.

For peace to be possible, generations of bloodshed and hatred must be brought to and end. But there are truths that neither side is willing to accept and ambitions they are loath to relinquish. As Alliance and Horde alike grasp for the Azerite’s power, their simmering conflict threatens to reignite all-out war—a war that would spell doom for Azeroth.
