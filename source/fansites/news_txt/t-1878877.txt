It's All About Pepe: New In-Game Outfits and Plush
You can finally find Pepe!


<div class="gallery" id="gallery-pepeloc">        </div>

There’s something about Pepe that has everyone all aflutter, and today we have a bunch more reasons for you to love him.

First, we’ve added a Pepe plush to the Blizzard Gear Store*! He’s soft, squishy, loveable, and can clip onto a hat or hairband or pretty much anywhere else to go with you anywhere Pepe wants to go.

Get your own Pepe now! 


      

But wait—there's more!

Pepe's Brand New Clothes
Several new in-game outfits for Pepe are also now available for you to track down. Collecting them all will reward the I Found Pepe!  achievement. We’ve written some clues—and more than a couple of bad rhymes—to get you started on the right path to locating each one. We’re not even a little sorry for it. Screenshots below not indicative of his in-game location. Good luck!

Knight Pepe – Talador
Sir Pepe is a knight, you see, but every warrior needs a rest. You’ll find him half-asleep right now near a pile of amythest.


  

Ninja Pepe – Gorgrond
What killed these iron hordies, you thought you knew—but alas, you were wrong. Turns out it was the stealthy Ninja Pepe all along.


  

Pirate Pepe – Spires of Arak
Pirate Pepe flew down south to visit his feathered friends. You’ll find him there relaxing in some arrakoa ru-ins.


  

Viking Pepe – Nagrand
This Pepe will be easy for anyone to spot. Viking Pepe always thought his dancing moves were hot.


  

Join the celebration of our Pepe overlord! Share your Pepe love and screenshots with the @Warcraft  Twitter using the hashtag #IFoundPepe all day today.
