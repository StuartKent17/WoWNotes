Traditional Tier Set Bonuses Removed in Battle for Azeroth
Gameinformer www.gameinformer.com released an interview with Ion Hazzikostas http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2017/11/14/world-of-warcraft-removing-traditional-raid-sets-in-battle-for-azeroth.aspx today that stated raid sets with bonuses will be phased out for Battle for Azeroth.


Raid set bonuses are being retired for BfA.
Gear will be more heavily themed to the place it comes from.
The team wants gear customization to be expressed through the Azerite system.
Tier sets lock down character slots and limit choices. 
Tier has begun to feel more like a drawback with so many different sources to obtain gear today.
Options from these sets will be rolled into how the Azerite system works for more customization in enhancing spells and abilities.

Blizzard pays attention to what artifact appearances are the most popular and consider that in future art design.
World quests and scaling technology is changing how the team creates the world in game.
There are no plans currently to recreate Gadgetzan in WoW to match the Hearthstone version.
The team will look at revamping faction cities only if it makes sense for the story.
The hubs of BfA reflect the lessons learned from previous hubs.
Allied races will add depth to classes. They will be able to be hero classes if it fits the lore.
Class options for Allied Races are based on the fantasy of the class and not just which faction needs another race option for a specific class.
PVP Warfronts are being talked about, but not something that has been decided on yet.
Low lying fog is something that was planned for Legion but wasn’t implemented until 8.0
There will be visual updates as you progress your Heart of Azeroth.
The team wants the Heart of Azeroth to feel more like the excitement and progression of the initial launch leveling of the Artifact Weapon and not so much the infinite trait artifact power dump from later in the Legion.
It is possible for players to keep multiple gear pieces from the Heart of Azeroth slots to switch between for certain encounters in the game.
Murlocs are not currently planned as an Allied Race.
Allied Races have been completely remapped from their NPC versions to fall in line with current playable races.
There are no plans currently to separate ranged dps and melee dps in the group finder, but it is possible in the future.

Class Balance in Classic Servers
I personally think its fair to have a discussion about classes/specs in Classic, considering class balancing as a philosophy didn't exist back then as it does now. The idea of a "hybrid tax" was obviously not very good in the grand scheme of overarching class design and it made some specs arguably not viable/unplayable. I'm not suggesting we make huge changes or even small changes at all for that matter, but that it is a worthwhile conversation to have.

We've been reading and talking about Classic within the Community team almost every day. Before BlizzCon we were all so nervous and, really, amazed that this project was actually going to be announced at the show. But we do need to make sure things are kept in perspective - we don't want to jump onto too much of a hype/posting train, as its still all coming together and there's not much that is concrete.

I can guarantee you that the Classic team will be listening, and we will be forwarding as much along as we can. We know this project means a lot to a lot of players, and it means a lot to us too. Blue Tracker [/b] ] Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759242036?page=11#201
