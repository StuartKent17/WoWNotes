War Banner<br>
We made it a banner for a couple of reasons. We thought the demoralizing and mocking mechanics were more useful if the warrior could place them somewhere else. For example, imagine a warrior (and not just a tank) using the Mocking Banner to direct incoming adds over to where the tank is currently standing. Now Skull Banner doesn&#x2019;t strictly have to be a banner, since the warrior will probably want to benefit from it most of the time, but we left it as a banner for one pretty cool reason: since the banner is an ally, you can Intervene to it (!). That opens up some cool gameplay options. <br>
<br>
Ultimately, we wanted to try and expand the design potential for warriors a bit. Increasingly, it seemed that any new ability had to be another type of movement, a weapon strike, or shout, or it wouldn&#x2019;t feel like a warrior ability. We wanted to try something new, and we&apos;re hoping that warriors will give them a shot once we&#x2019;re in beta and let us know how it feels.

<br>
Protection Spec and PvP<br>
We don&apos;t have a problem with players choosing to PvP as tank specs, but if they do, then we want them to be effective because of their defensive and control abilities, not because of their damage-dealing potential. It&apos;s intentional that, overall, tanks have to sacrifice some DPS in order to make up for their other strengths. <br>
<br>
For comparison&apos;s sake, we don&apos;t think it would be cool if healing specs did as much or more damage than DPS specs in PvP, and the same is true for tanks. In Battlegrounds, tanks often do have a role, whether it&#x2019;s running flags, defending a node or tanking NPCs. It is much harder to provide tanks a role in Arenas since the strategy ultimately revolves around focusing down enemy players. Nobody wants to try to focus down a tank, and tanks typically can&#x2019;t contribute as much to focusing down enemy targets.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m not so much for debates, because design isn&apos;t about rhetorical prowess, it&apos;s about making the game the best it can be for all players, not simply those who can make a compelling case on the forums. Because of how personal (even emotional) the experience of playing a character is, sometimes it&apos;s hard to see over the fence into someone else&apos;s yard. We have to keep an eye on the whole neighborhood.

Still waiting....<br>
There will be plenty of information coming out of the press tour. This week, is all about getting that information to the media and fansites so they can show you what they&apos;ve learned next week. I am not going to get into specifics of what is going to be covered, but you can be assured, it&apos;s what some would call a plethora of information.
