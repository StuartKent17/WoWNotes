Boubouille2011-04-01, 03:59 AMWorld of Warcraft 5.0 - Panda Mania!
In the latest Patch 4.1 PTR Build, two new halloween masks textures have been added to the game files:



Helm_MaskHalloween_PaF.blp
Helm_MaskHalloween_PaM.blp


They seem to be early-alpha texture but according to what happened with the datamining/leak of the Cataclysm races http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/657478-Goblins-and-Worgens-are-the-new-races-of-the-Expansion 2 years ago, it looks like Pandarens will be the race of the next expansion! The name of texture for any piece of headset always ends with the first 2 character of the name of the race Pa and the gender M/F, according to how the textures look it's really easy to conclude what the new race is.

More datamining reveals that the expansion is apparently named Panda Mania! and also uncovered a possible trailer ....
