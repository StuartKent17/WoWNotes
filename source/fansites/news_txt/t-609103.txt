WWI Splash Screen - Day 3
The splash screen on Blizzard.com  has been updated once again. It's definitely looking more and more icy ... This time a rune from Starcraft 2 appeared, and it looks like Blizzard decided to add a few things from each one of their game just to let you theorycraft before the WWI. Note : It's Diablo 3, seriously


 


PTR 2.4.3 - Premade Characters Available
Premade characters are now available on PTRs, but you'll probably have to wait a few days before you can get a character copied. 
The problems with Pre-made characters have been resolved, they should no longer be failing.

The character copy queue is now full and copies are taking multiple days to complete. Please be patient. 


PTR 2.4.3 - Brewfest testing
We've made some changes to Brewfest this year, and we're testing it out on the PTR. We have a few things in particular we'd like you to test when the holiday is active:

The Dark Iron Attack is back this year, every half-hour at the main Brewfest camps outside of Orgrimmar and Ironforge. Please test out the attack and give us your feedback on how it plays out.

There is a new boss in Blackrock Depths to test -- Coren Direbrew, who is located in the Grim Guzzler. The mole machine directly to the right as you zone in should transport you to the Grim Guzzler. No need to clear all the way up there
The revamped brewfest is now available on PTRs, some additions have been made including a new event Headless Horseman/Ahune-like boss named Coren Direbrew  You can get 4 epic trinkets from him, and an upgraded version of good old Barman Shanker !

Also, a few more items have been discovered on PTRs  Also, alliance players won't get the Kodo mount like the Horde did with the Ram mount last year, sorry. 
The decision was made to give Horde the Kodo and Alliance the Ram this year. I apologize if there were expectations that the Alliance would get a Horde mount; we were in discussions about this for a long time. I hope that you'll enjoy the holiday regardless. 


Arena Season 4 Begins
The Season 4 is now available on both european and american realms !
Arena Season 4 has now officially begun, and players can immediately begin competing for the new Brutal Gladiator and Guardian PvP item sets. Players will now also be able to purchase Arena Season 2 items using the honor system. Please note that we have reset all Arena team and personal ratings, though players retain their Arena points and teams. The team and personal rating have simply been reset to the default 1500, allowing all teams to once again compete for top honors with a fresh start. Also, with the end of the third season, players on the top teams from each battlegroup will be receiving their end-of-season rewards approximately one week from today. These include Arena-specific titles that they can display proudly until the end of the new season, and, for the best of the best, an Armored Nether Drake.

It's very important for players who feel that they may be eligible for the Arena-specific title and/or Armored Nether Drake to refrain from transferring their character to another realm between now and when these end-of-season rewards are physically awarded, otherwise they will become ineligible to receive either. 


Blue posts
Death Knight Tanking
That said, the Deathknight will be able to tank things, we have talked about them having abilities that help them tank casters, but that doesn't automatically mean they are limited to 5 person dungeons or caster-specific encounters. It may be awhile for some players to learn how to play a whole new class and level them up, but the option will likely be available to players/raid groups to have Deathknights tank a large number of encounters.

Epic Tabards added as UDE Points rewards
For the first time since the launch of the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game, The Upper Deck Entertainment UDE Points Store will be expanding its World of Warcraft In-Game item offering, with six new tabards!

Starting after Blizzard’s 2.4.3 patch, the UDE Points Store will roll out these new tabards. Players will be able to match their love of the Trading Card Game with their in-game fashion sense, since the six new tabards will offer something to go with just about any set of Armor!
