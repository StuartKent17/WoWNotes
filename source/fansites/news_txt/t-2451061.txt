The Spirit of Sharing
The main area where the festivities take place is right outside the capital cities for the Horde and Alliance and in a couple of smaller towns.


Players can interact with the many foods options set on these tables and will gain a buff by eating or passing each of the servings. 
There are 5 buffs in total that you can gain that when combined together will reward the The Spirit of Sharing http://www.wowdb.com/spells/61849-the-spirit-of-sharing buff that grants 10% increase in reputation gains for one hour. This is great if you are working on Legion reputations and completing World Quests or working on other reputations for a little boost.
