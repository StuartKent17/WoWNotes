Boubouille2009-09-24, 11:46 AMUpdate - If you cannot find the mail in your inbox, make sure you check your spam folder. A lot of providers flagged the email as spam because of how the email was built in the first place. The  link doesn't point to blizzcon.com directly but redirects you to mailman.netcraft.co.il first, most likely for tracking purposes. If you don't feel safe clicking that link even if it won't cause any problem just type  manually in your browser and redeem your code here. 

Grunty now available to stream viewers
People who purchased the Blizzcon Stream from Rayv can now redeem their pet by following the instructions in the mail they received a few minutes ago.
