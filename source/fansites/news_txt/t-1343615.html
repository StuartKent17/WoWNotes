Siege of Orgrimmar Raid Schedule<br>
Don&apos;t forget that Heroic Siege of Orgrimmar, Flex Wing 2, and Raid Finder Wing 1 all open this week! <br>
<br>
You can get started on building your Tier 16 set (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/846-Patch-5-4-Tier-16-Armor-Sets) or just working towards the Heirloom weapons from Garrosh (http://www.wowdb.com/items/weapons?filter-patch=17056&amp;filter-quality=128). Be sure to check out the weapon models on the WoWDB pages (http://www.wowdb.com/items/105683-hellscreams-warbow) with our new modelviewer, as they use the same models as the old High Warlord weapons (http://www.wowdb.com/items/weapons?filter-search=High+Warlord&amp;filter-quality=16).<br>

Garrosh Loot Table Hotfix &amp; Compensation<br>
When Patch 5.4 released, Garrosh Hellscream was set to drop one tier token on 25-player Normal difficulty. This was inconsistent with other bosses in the zone, and we planned to correct that via hotfix. Our intent was to release this hotfix during weekly maintenance to keep rewards consistent throughout this reset; unfortunately, due to an error on our part, the hotfix was applied early to the North American and Asian servers. This has resulted in an unfair advantage for guilds that defeated Garrosh later in the week, not only against the NA/Asian guilds that defeated him before the hotfix was applied, but also against all European guilds that have defeated him (as the hotfix has not yet been applied there).<br>
<br>
Fortunately, this only affects a small number of guilds, so we are able to correct the error. We&#x2019;ll be reaching out to all guilds who only received one token from a successful Garrosh kill this week and providing the Guildmaster with an extra two tokens at random, which can then be distributed to any raid members who were present at the time of the kill.<br>
<br>
We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience or frustration that this has caused. Thanks for your understanding, and good luck in Heroic difficulty!<br>

BlizzCon 2013 - Shape the WoW Art Panel<br>
BlizzCon 2013 is fast approaching, and we want to ensure the World of Warcraft Art panel not only has the visual content and insights we&#x2019;ve presented in the past, but also show things that you specifically have always wanted to see discussed. We&#x2019;re also looking at the possibility of including you in the panel by way of your questions recorded via YouTube!<br>
<br>
Curious about how we create a weapon? Want to know what it&#x2019;s like to animate a battle pet? Pondering the finer points of poly counts? The sky is the limit! Help us make the art panel you want to see by posting or recording your questions and ideas for how we can show the processes and content as presented by the World of Warcraft art team.<br>
<br>
Instructions:<br>
Reply to this thread with your questions or ideas, or link to a YouTube video of yourself asking our art team a question that could lead to us showing off cool content and processes.<br>
<br>
Here are a few pointers to help everyone get the most out of this:<br>
<br>
<br>
Be aware of what other people are asking. We&#x2019;re not tallying votes here, so if someone has already asked something there&#x2019;s no need for you to ask it again, and another post with the same question will just fill up the thread that much quicker.<br>
Let&#x2019;s stay constructive, and ask questions that are likely to have answers we can give. Statements reworded into questions, or questions asking for big content reveals are likely to be ignored or removed.<br>
This is for the art panel! Our artists make art, so questions about class balance, servers, systems design, etc. aren&#x2019;t going to be of much help.<br>
Let&#x2019;s keep the thread on-topic. If you want to talk more about a specific topic, please take it to another thread. If you record a YouTube video (and we hope you do!) please keep in mind that quality of the video and trademark infringement are big considerations. We&#x2019;re not going to be able to use low-res videos, or ones with lots of trademarked products/logos showing or unlicensed music player over the top.<br>
<br>
<br>
That should cover it, and thank you for helping us to shape the World of Warcraft Art Panel you want to see!<br>
<br>
Will models like Jaina and Tyrande ever be updated to look appropriate or good?<br>
This is a good example of a statement reworded into a question. You&apos;re stating you think something looks bad, and phrasing it in the form of a question. These kinds of non-questions can&apos;t really be answered as they&apos;re not intended to receive a satisfactory response. Instead, you could ask &quot;What determines when a faction leader will have their visuals updated?&quot;<br>
<br>
Let&apos;s stay on-topic though, and please reference the bullet points before posting.<br>
<br>
<br>
Attention: iPhone/iOS Users<br>
Greetings, everyone!<br>
<br>
In just a few days, Apple will be releasing the latest iOS update as well as the new iPhone. The upcoming iOS update may cause iPhone Mobile Authenticators to reset. When you update your phone&apos;s OS, we recommend taking any one of the following precautionary steps:<br>
<br>
Sign up for the free SMS Protect service (https://us.battle.net/account/management/mobile-alert-dashboard.html?utm_source=%20internal-support_forums&amp;utm_medium=%20posting%20&amp;utm_campaign=BlizzardCS&amp;utm_content=091613). In the event of a lost, broken, or accidentally reset authenticator, users with SMS Protect can remove the old authenticator from their account with a texted security code. For more information, visit the SMS Protect FAQ (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/3300033?utm_source=%20internal-support_forums&amp;utm_medium=%20posting%20&amp;utm_campaign=BlizzardCS&amp;utm_content=091613).<br>
Write down your authenticator&apos;s Serial Number and Restore Code so that you may restore your authenticator (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/100623#4?utm_source=%20internal-support_forums&amp;utm_medium=%20posting%20&amp;utm_campaign=BlizzardCS&amp;utm_content=091613) to your phone after the OS update is finished. You may also wish to take a screenshot of this information.<br>
Temporarily remove the authenticator before updating. Reattach the authenticator again once your iOS update is complete. You can remove the authenticator through our Web Chat option if necessary by contacting the Blizzard Support page (https://us.battle.net/support/en/ticket/submit?utm_source=%20internal-support_forums&amp;utm_medium=%20posting%20&amp;utm_campaign=BlizzardCS&amp;utm_content=091613) and selecting Battle.net &gt; I have an issue managing my account &gt; I want to remove my authenticator &gt; Live chat. If Live Chat shows offline, refresh the web page and try again.<br>
Update over Wi-Fi. iPhones that are updated over Wi-Fi rather than through a computer are less prone to accidental resets.<br>
<br>
<br>

Fan Art Update<br>
The World of Warcraft Fan Art Section (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/media/fanart/#/1) has been updated with new fan artwork.<br>
