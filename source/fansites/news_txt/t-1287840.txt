Blue Tweets
Classes
It's probably still a valid point, but don't compare a mitigation-geared DK to a haste-geared paladin. 
It is also the case that some tanks care a lot about their DPS and some just don't, even at the cutting-edge. That skews data. Source 

stop removing unique class abilities to just add X generic for all classes. Bring back mana burn
We do the X generic thing to avoid too much class stacking / benching. Mana Burn we just didn't like. Source 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
So, wait. in 5.3 Sudden Doom does NOTHING for DKs before level 70? seems silly.
Unholy Presence is level 64 now. Source 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Hunter Bloat:EotB not "bloat-" Rotational and combat bloat is the problem. Ex.rather have Widow Venom baked in like war/monks.
While combat bloat is a bigger problem, anything that fills up action bars is a problem. Venom would be a small PvP buff. Source 

why don't you want to answer to a question about hunter pet auto-taunt in dungeons? It's an obstacle that shouldn't exist.
It's a problem but we haven't come up with a solution we like more than the problem. Source 

You made warriors dual 2h weaps you dedicated whole mop to locks why cant hunters dual 1h guns?
It would require a lot of new animation and itemization and we're not sure the gain, while positive, would be worth the cost. Source 
And whenever I say "cost" I am talking about production time, which is much more salient to our development than dollars. Source 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
E.g., FB plus Flamestrike plus 3 GCDs of Blizzard weaker than 5x NT. FB strong enough, but fillers too weak so NT stays ahead.
We were just talking about this. It's a fair point. We probably should have buffed the AEs when we buffed the bombs. Source 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Eminence not procing legendary, Glyph of Uplift isn't working with it. Channels don't benefit until recast.
Because it's Real PPM tm as long as something procs it, you'll get the full benefit from the buff. Source 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Holy Paladin T14 4pc bonus feels mandatory because its better than T15 heroic items please do something
Still skeptical of this. Giving up all of those stats on the higher ilevel is a big cost. Source 
Thats the whole problem. You're trading 4t14 with stats, the t15 bonuses are absolute 0. The 4 t14 bonus is also fun...
I think absolute 0 is probably an overstatement. What you're talking us into though is nerfing the t14 4 pc. Source 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
I quote in 5.2 "We nerfed Phantasm and Psyfiend we didn’t want to hurt Mass Dispel or other utility that Shadow" I'm confused?
We looked, and very few Shadow took the Glyph of Mass Dispel, so we didn't think the cast time would be that noticeable. Source 
I should clarify that I meant the glyph in PvE. We don't want to nerf PvE utility. We DO want to nerf PvP utility for Shadow. Source 
Have you considered giving mass dispel the colossal smash treatment? Pve/PvP versions
We did, but it's more complicated than CS because we're generally okay with Disc / Holy Mass Dispel. Source 

A nerf to atonement means death to atonement. No one will ever use it and you'll have once again nerfed fun.
I predict Atonement will be fine, just not the answer to every healing situation as it can be on live. Source 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
is the ST nerf thanks to the DT Buff last patch? Was fun as a CP Generator, not as a wannabe autoattack spin-off.
We didn't like it as a cheap CP generator. We wanted it to be for times when you couldn't be in melee. Source 

Potting as a Rogue is annoying, possible to allow pots usable in stealth?
That doesn't seem unreasonable. We'll discuss. Source 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Curious as to decision on shammies and staves, would have liked Spiritbinding Spire from LFR as it goes well with Shammy T15?
It's a tough one. We heard from shaman upset that we would give them a 2H weapon and not allow use of their shield. Source 

Based on feedback, we are going to revert the change and let shaman win caster staves and maces once again. Source 
So you will listen to feedback on staffs but completely ignore reasonable feedback to revert the totem change?
Taking feedback isn't the same as doing whatever the community asks us to do. The design decisions are still ours to make. Source 

Is there any chance of re-vamping Unleash Elements, specifically for ele shamans? It's practically a useless spell.
No immediate plans. It is rotational with Unleashed Fury and provides utility otherwise. The moving part is less important now. Source 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
are you happy with the green fire boss? Its the best thing ever to happen in pve imo. Can you confirm it will not be nerfed?
I can't promise it won't ever be, but it is self-nerfing as players get more gear. Some players have done it very undergeared. Source 

Maelific G. and Haunt seem like they're too hard to design for pvp but they are perfect for pve. Pt.2
Agreed. This is the heart of the problem. SB:SS also means individual dots can't do that much damage in PvE, which hurts PvP. Source 
But I should clarify that we generally like SB:SS in PvE. It's PvP where it hold Affliction back. Source 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Once bloodthirst doesn't crit, nor proc and my rage is low. I have no other option than to wait for CD. Is this the intention?
Yes. Source 

How many arena warriors w/o 2nd wind? If you just thought "at what rating", cookie cutter.
Might make sense to bake it in, but then warriors would not need a healing talent on top of that. Still evaluating solutions. Source 

Is it intended that Deep Wounds isn't benefitting from passive bonuses such as Seasoned solider and the SMF bonus?
We like the DPS it is doing. If we made it benefit from other passives, we would lower the damage it does to compensate. Source 

PvE
So Primordius now takes 75% less damage instead of 25% right? So what's about all those Guilds killed him with 25% less damage
We had to make that change to fix a degenerate strategy. We also lowered his health to compensate. Source 

why the nerfs to 10 man normal?
We gather a tremendous amount of data on raid progression. Some encounters were tougher than intended or compared to 5.0. Source 
so how many weeks should it take a normal 10 man guild like mine to clear ToT normal? just wondering if we are behind or ahead
Typically the most relevant variable is how many nights a week you raid. There's no right answer, but fewer nights = longer. Source 

it sucked re-learning a farm fight. I don't hate on LFR, but why not nerf the maze hard in LFR vs big changes in norm/Hero?
It was confusing in N and H too. The maze should be the challenge not the graphics and the run backwards part was just dumb. Source 

I loved 4.3 - LFR DS to reg/heroic DS with my guild on 4 toons every week. now I only have one raiding 90, period.
You are comparing an overly long final tier to a hopefully short mid-tier though. Source 

Do you think anyone will do heroic scenarios without an LFG tool? You'd spend more time finding a group than doing content.
We can't make random matchmaking content too challenging. If you have to form a group, there is some incentive to make it work. Source 
But it's definitely an experiment. We'll see what the response is. More challenge for more reward / efficiency could be fun. Source 

Looking at the avalaible data, ToT seems to be a heavy ranged favored tier, only rogues can compete in single. Thoughs?
Pretty happy with it overall. Having 2 dot fights early on skews perceptions a bit. Source 

What is your opinion on the amount of trash mobs in ToT? Most people I talk to raid team/LFR think that there is too much
It's hard to get a good read on such feedback because players inherently argue for as little trash as possible. Source 
Yes players want less trash. I don't understand this anti player request mentality.
Players ask for a lot that would make raiding easier or more convenient. That doesn't mean it's good for the game. Source 
Inconvenience for the sake of inconvenience is also not good for the game.
Similarly, bosses without trash in between don't feel like bosses and the raid doesn't feel epic. Pacing is important. Source 
Again, opinion stated as fact. "Feel epic" is subjective meaningless term that lets devs justify anything.
"Feel" makes it an opinion, not a fact. And yes, our opinions are important because we develop the game. Source 

Pacing is important. ToT fails at good pacing. Why are you defending this?
Because pacing is subjective and we're happy with it. Source 

Pacing was much better in Ulduar, just saying. This instance is designed for LFR, norm/hard are addendums?
We always design normal first. Source 

A lot of pulls you need to "tip-toe" compared to past raids where you AoE/burn. Ulduar still best.
I find AE/burn more tedious than anything. I like to be making some decisions when I play, even on trash. Source 

What was wrong with HoF/ToES/MV trash? Why did you need 3-4x more?
The raid occupies a lot of geographic space... which is something many players were requesting. Source 

I'd like to get some clarification on the Secrets of the Empire drop. Is the drop chance shared between LFR and normal/heroic?
Yes. You should not have to run LFR for those drops if you also run normal or heroic. Source
