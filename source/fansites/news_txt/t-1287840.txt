It's probably still a valid point, but don't compare a mitigation-geared DK to a haste-geared paladin. 
It is also the case that some tanks care a lot about their DPS and some just don't, even at the cutting-edge. That skews data. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321771823853363200

stop removing unique class abilities to just add X generic for all classes. Bring back mana burn

Hunter Bloat:EotB not "bloat-" Rotational and combat bloat is the problem. Ex.rather have Widow Venom baked in like war/monks.
While combat bloat is a bigger problem, anything that fills up action bars is a problem. Venom would be a small PvP buff. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322389324408709120

E.g., FB plus Flamestrike plus 3 GCDs of Blizzard weaker than 5x NT. FB strong enough, but fillers too weak so NT stays ahead.

Holy Paladin T14 4pc bonus feels mandatory because its better than T15 heroic items please do something
Still skeptical of this. Giving up all of those stats on the higher ilevel is a big cost. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322389723807088640
Thats the whole problem. You're trading 4t14 with stats, the t15 bonuses are absolute 0. The 4 t14 bonus is also fun...
I think absolute 0 is probably an overstatement. What you're talking us into though is nerfing the t14 4 pc. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322435686533849088

I quote in 5.2 "We nerfed Phantasm and Psyfiend we didn’t want to hurt Mass Dispel or other utility that Shadow" I'm confused?
We looked, and very few Shadow took the Glyph of Mass Dispel, so we didn't think the cast time would be that noticeable. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321669166513922048
I should clarify that I meant the glyph in PvE. We don't want to nerf PvE utility. We DO want to nerf PvP utility for Shadow. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321704368908935168
Have you considered giving mass dispel the colossal smash treatment? Pve/PvP versions
We did, but it's more complicated than CS because we're generally okay with Disc / Holy Mass Dispel. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321715435403870210

Curious as to decision on shammies and staves, would have liked Spiritbinding Spire from LFR as it goes well with Shammy T15?
It's a tough one. We heard from shaman upset that we would give them a 2H weapon and not allow use of their shield. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321665996979048448

Based on feedback, we are going to revert the change and let shaman win caster staves and maces once again. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321792115040460800
So you will listen to feedback on staffs but completely ignore reasonable feedback to revert the totem change?
Taking feedback isn't the same as doing whatever the community asks us to do. The design decisions are still ours to make. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322027908015194113

Is there any chance of re-vamping Unleash Elements, specifically for ele shamans? It's practically a useless spell.

are you happy with the green fire boss? Its the best thing ever to happen in pve imo. Can you confirm it will not be nerfed?
I can't promise it won't ever be, but it is self-nerfing as players get more gear. Some players have done it very undergeared. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321316378894282754

Maelific G. and Haunt seem like they're too hard to design for pvp but they are perfect for pve. Pt.2
Agreed. This is the heart of the problem. SB:SS also means individual dots can't do that much damage in PvE, which hurts PvP. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/320261555537182721

How many arena warriors w/o 2nd wind? If you just thought "at what rating", cookie cutter.
Might make sense to bake it in, but then warriors would not need a healing talent on top of that. Still evaluating solutions. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321436159119069184

Is it intended that Deep Wounds isn't benefitting from passive bonuses such as Seasoned solider and the SMF bonus?
We like the DPS it is doing. If we made it benefit from other passives, we would lower the damage it does to compensate. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321316505163821056

PvE
So Primordius now takes 75% less damage instead of 25% right? So what's about all those Guilds killed him with 25% less damage
We had to make that change to fix a degenerate strategy. We also lowered his health to compensate. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322029376097095681

why the nerfs to 10 man normal?
We gather a tremendous amount of data on raid progression. Some encounters were tougher than intended or compared to 5.0. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322394457276289024
so how many weeks should it take a normal 10 man guild like mine to clear ToT normal? just wondering if we are behind or ahead
Typically the most relevant variable is how many nights a week you raid. There's no right answer, but fewer nights = longer. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322436607321985024

it sucked re-learning a farm fight. I don't hate on LFR, but why not nerf the maze hard in LFR vs big changes in norm/Hero?
It was confusing in N and H too. The maze should be the challenge not the graphics and the run backwards part was just dumb. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322392491334709248

I loved 4.3 - LFR DS to reg/heroic DS with my guild on 4 toons every week. now I only have one raiding 90, period.
You are comparing an overly long final tier to a hopefully short mid-tier though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319166738057023488

Do you think anyone will do heroic scenarios without an LFG tool? You'd spend more time finding a group than doing content.
We can't make random matchmaking content too challenging. If you have to form a group, there is some incentive to make it work. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319916362673827840
But it's definitely an experiment. We'll see what the response is. More challenge for more reward / efficiency could be fun. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319916488301613056

Looking at the avalaible data, ToT seems to be a heavy ranged favored tier, only rogues can compete in single. Thoughs?
Pretty happy with it overall. Having 2 dot fights early on skews perceptions a bit. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322439091121692675

What is your opinion on the amount of trash mobs in ToT? Most people I talk to raid team/LFR think that there is too much
It's hard to get a good read on such feedback because players inherently argue for as little trash as possible. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318812750371487744
Yes players want less trash. I don't understand this anti player request mentality.
Players ask for a lot that would make raiding easier or more convenient. That doesn't mean it's good for the game. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319242203132211200
Inconvenience for the sake of inconvenience is also not good for the game.
Similarly, bosses without trash in between don't feel like bosses and the raid doesn't feel epic. Pacing is important. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319243564808818689
Again, opinion stated as fact. "Feel epic" is subjective meaningless term that lets devs justify anything.
"Feel" makes it an opinion, not a fact. And yes, our opinions are important because we develop the game. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321323232382828545

Pacing is important. ToT fails at good pacing. Why are you defending this?
Because pacing is subjective and we're happy with it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319517834810109952

Pacing was much better in Ulduar, just saying. This instance is designed for LFR, norm/hard are addendums?
We always design normal first. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319515615347998720

A lot of pulls you need to "tip-toe" compared to past raids where you AoE/burn. Ulduar still best.
I find AE/burn more tedious than anything. I like to be making some decisions when I play, even on trash. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318820801853943808

What was wrong with HoF/ToES/MV trash? Why did you need 3-4x more?
The raid occupies a lot of geographic space... which is something many players were requesting. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318814933057941504

I'd like to get some clarification on the Secrets of the Empire drop. Is the drop chance shared between LFR and normal/heroic?
Yes. You should not have to run LFR for those drops if you also run normal or heroic. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319241980309819393
