The BlizzCon&#xAE; 2015 online merchandise sale has begun! Beginning today, October 16 through November 8, BlizzCon attendees and Virtual Ticket holders have access to a treasure trove of BlizzCon-premiere loot through the Blizzard Gear Store (http://gear.blizzard.com/).

<br>
To access the BlizzCon sale, simply head to the Blizzard Gear Store (gear.blizzard.com (http://gear.blizzard.com/)), and log in using the Battle.net account you used to purchase your Virtual Ticket. Each of this year&#x2019;s BlizzCon-premiere products will be marked with a BlizzCon logo.<br>
<br>
If you&#x2019;re attending BlizzCon in person, use the account on which you redeemed the BlizzCon Digital Bonuses code sent to you via email earlier this year. If a friend bought your ticket for you, ask them for your code&#x2014;remember, it also grants you a Virtual Ticket and this year&#x2019;s in-game goodies (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/blog/19888091/blizzcon-2015-in-game-goodies-round-up-9-21-2015)&#x2014;and head to www.battle.net/code (http://www.battle.net/code) to redeem it.<br>

<br>
Supplies are limited, so if you spot anything you like, make sure to order early. All orders will be shipped upon receipt&#x2014;so the sooner you order, the faster you&#x2019;ll get your BlizzCon swag. Keep in mind that orders are shipped from the United States, so international shipping rates may apply. We&#x2019;ll also be adding new items once BlizzCon gets underway on November 6, so be sure to check back in then.<br>
<br>
Happy hunting!<br>

The Infinite Timereaver from Timewalking.<br>
Isn&apos;t all the loot in TW dungeons personal anyway? So I guess that the mount will be the same.<br>
This is correct. The Infinite Timereaver will be awarded via Personal Loot. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/390414-the-infinite-timereaver-from-timewalking/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16203140637?page=1#10))<br>

GMs Appearing in Game<br>
This is a request we see crop-up from time to time. While I do appreciate that it sounds cool for a Game Master (GM) to appear in a capital city and spawn something, this would also be a very disruptive event that could ruin the gameplay experience for others. It would also somehwat break the immersion of the game if Hydross, for example, suddenly appeared in Stormwind. There is also only a finite amount of times such an event can be done before it starts being perceived as an annoyance, or loses its significance.<br>
<br>
This is why such events are normally used to celebrate the end of Beta and the shut-down of the Beta servers; a fun once-off event that doesn&apos;t affect the live Realms in any form, but signifies the destruction of the Beta world and makes for some cool videos and screenshots. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/390330-gm-in-sw-org-fun/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16203580609?page=1#8))<br>

So what software do you guys use for animation?<br>
maya for animation (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/651608813137604609))<br>
<br>
Having more LAN events outside of Blizzcon, is that something you guys have been thinking about for wow esports?<br>
We&apos;re primarily focused on Blizzcon and the Road to Blizzcon. If a major event wanted to add WoW to their schedule, we&apos;d love it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/651791753679273985))<br>
<br>
When you can&apos;t fail, everything matters less. Some reflections (https://pretensionsofwisdom.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/designing-failure-the-value-of-failing/) on the value of death penalties in games. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/652166006895284225))<br>
. its why not alot of people play hardcore or do wow iron man<br>
Yeah, those are definitely some of the trade-offs. A more engaged audience perhaps, but typically a smaller one. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/652177537775202304))<br>
I&apos;m planning on making a couple more posts on the subject that tap into the areas between the 2 extremes. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/652177895167688704))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Majority rule isn&apos;t always great for design either. Cell phone customers always just ask for more battery life not features.<br>
Still not a good idea to tell customers &quot;The battery life is fine. Here&apos;s a bunch of features you didn&apos;t ask for.&quot;<br>
I&apos;m hardly a cellphone historian but I don&apos;t remember users asking for a camera, map and music on their phones. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/651602712904118272))<br>
