In expansions, we inevitably make a lot of changes. In the past, we haven't done as good of a job as we could at explaining /why/ on each. Celestalon 
This time around, we're going to try to improve that, significantly. Things like design philosophy, intended effects, etc. Celestalon 
It's a much larger undertaking than it may sound. The translation logistics alone are huge. But we're hoping you like the result Celestalon 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
All this sounds like its a much better Dancing Rune Weapon
We've made some significant improvements to DRW's functionality in 6.0, so hopefully this won't feel 'much better' anymore. Celestalon 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
hearing reports that starfall doesn't proc meta gem maybe trinkets too since the hotfix for nazgrim/immerseus
That is probably correct. We'll look into it. WatcherDev 
thank you, I'd be fine not using starfall in D-stance anyway if you have to revert hotfix.
Starfall not procing things should have no basically impact on DPS. Celestalon 
Starfall helped increase APM. A lot of players are changing playstyle/rotation to increase APM to "force" ICD procs
I'd like to see whatever basis you have for doing that. Its impact on trinket uptime is extremely negligible. Celestalon 
additionally, if bindings doesn't proc on the icd, it has a large impact on dmg on 1st trans adds on garrosh embodied doubt
Starfall can still proc Bindings of Immerseus; just tried it. Celestalon 
well this is awkward
And Starfall couldn't proc Lightweave before either. Celestalon 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
with the buff of aspect of the hawk. will iron hawk get the +10% ap ontop it used to have or just be +10% damage reduction?
Perhaps a misunderstanding? Iron Hawk and regular Hawk have the same +%AP. The recent buff affected both. Celestalon 
iron hawk used to be +35% ap when hawk was+25%. so iron hawk had a extra 10%ap as well as 10% damage reduction.
That has never been true, at any point. Celestalon 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
E.g. right now lots of players avoiding Shadow priest because of low "theoretical" parsing, but doing well when able to multidot
Yeah, people play and put effort into what they hear is best. Inflates those numbers, deflates what's perceived as worse. Celestalon 
Do players also tend toward easier specs that do well, like Frost Mage very easy vs say Fire more random, less control, etc?
That helps a bit, yeah. Destruction is much easier to get near optimal damage out of than Demonology. Contributes to the percep. Celestalon 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
What's the ability that's given the design crew the most nightmares recently?
Shadow Reflection, at the moment. Customizing what it copies, and ensure it benefits from other passives. We'll get it right. Celestalon 
It has pretty crazy potential. I'm especially eager to see what some high end PvPers can do with it, when they get good at... Celestalon 
...anticipating their enemies actions. It will be very hard to line up, but you could both damage and CC/interrupt with it. Celestalon 
Of course it has quite solid PvE potential as well, but the things you do with it will be less... unexpected Celestalon 
Maybe not best place/time for this q, but: What happens if current target despawns/dies or a target clear otherwise occurs?
Shadow despawns. She's tied to the target. Celestalon 
So it requires 16 seconds of consecutive uptime on a single target to work fully -- and 9 just to have any effect at all?
Er... wait. Maybe not uptime. What happens if I hit ShadRef while out of range of the target and spam Mutilate for 8 seconds?
Target needs to be attackable at time 0, and time 8-16. You need to be able to attack SOMETHING for time 0-8. Celestalon 
It only copies abilities you successfully cast. You don't have to be in range of what you put it on though. Celestalon 
So basically Shadow is much cooler, simpler and easy to use version of Focusing Crytal?
Nope. Celestalon 
does the shadow only copy abilities or autoattacks as well? Poisons?
Offensive abilities only, no auto attacks or poisons. Celestalon 
Is the shadow affected by any diminishing return timers that the player may have triggered during the "recording" period?
Yes, DR fully affects all of her casts, just as if you or another friendly rogue had cast them. Celestalon 
I take it that means dynamic buffs also update on the rogue/shadow dynamically e.g., Heroism at the 10th second?
She inherits your buffs live, not offset. So you get an Agi proc and Mut just before it wears off, it won't affect her Mut. Celestalon 
However, if you get an Agi proc AFTER you Mutilate, her Mutilate WOULD benefit from it. Celestalon 
Suessing it wont work for Smoke? Or will the debuff be refreshed on the target and still removed elsewhere?
I know Smoke Bomb has offensive potential, but we're not going to count it as an offensive ability; she won't copy it. Celestalon 
It's going to be a lot of fun watching how our resident geniuses plan and plot around all of this. I really hope it works.
Yeah, it has a really fun kit to it too; it's like you're teaching a pupil the best combo you know. Celestalon 
An incredibly adept pupil, anyway. And attractive, too.
Hah... Not at the moment! My test character is currently one of the new race models that isn't done yet... Untextured skin! Celestalon 
I can only imagine what that looks like, I'm guessing a little creepy.
More than a little. Celestalon 

Example: the rogue might start with a 4 combo finisher, is that the first thing she will cast as well?
Yes, her finishers are copies of yours, as far as CP goes. The first thing she'd cast would be a 4cp finisher in your example. Celestalon 
It would already be op and stupid in pvp if it only copied damage double Killing S or double SD + MfD ...
Fortunately, I can tell by your tweets that you're misunderstanding the basics of the ability. The offset is gigantic. Celestalon 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Why was Far Sight stealth nerfed for Shamans? Got no major complaints about it, but for a flavor spell, it no longer has flavor.
I'm not aware of any nerf to it; what changed? Celestalon 
It has gone from unlimited range to 1000 yard range, so basically it's just a "zoom" now. It's a huge change for the worse sadly
Probably just a bugfix for some bug. Your client doesn't even load that far away anyway. How has it affected you? Celestalon 
Actually, you could use Far Sight within Far Sight - we could see from Moonglade to Tanaris if we wanted to.
Ahhhh, that's right! I forgot about that. I'll see if I can find out why the range was added, and if there's some alternate fix. Celestalon 
Excellent! Alot of shammies have been wondering about this, it has always been a truly fun flavor spell, bit sad over the change
Good news: Found an alternate fix, and put it back to unlimited range. Celestalon 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
just read your tweets about demo lock. They are underpowered, they are far behind in single target and aoe, a fix would be good.
Demonology only looks underpowered compared to Affliction/Destruction. That's not grounds for a buff. Celestalon 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
is it possible to add in WoD a proc art for raging blow in fury spec? Dont get why we dont already have one 
Yes. Celestalon 

Does "it nerfs PvE prot warrs hard on the altar of PvP" hold water ?
Feel like PvE players can get similar gameplay if they had talented into the stun through Warbringer. holinka 
But lose double charge in the process. I'm also thinking about the hinted stormbolt/bladestorm swap.
Warriors can currently build into too much control or too much damage. The swap would fix that. holinka 
The only compelling argument is that the spell has been a certain way forever & this change needs more testing. holinka 
The argument that "we tried this before" doesn't hold water as it's a different change. holinka 
No, same change. Charge on DR did not work.
We were keeping charge on a different DR, but removing the part that stops casting. holinka 
So the whole point of this change is to get rid of focus charge interrupts.
Charge's design is a gap closer. They have gained control/disruption through the talent tree. holinka 
We have no problem with warrior mobility but Double Time/Juggernaut have made them too disruptive holinka 
So sort of confused as what the final iteration of changes will be. Charge left alone, DS/Pummel sharing a CD?
Yes, charge left alone, DS/Pummel sharing a CD. holinka 
And I don't agree that you need it to be a stun to be effective at peeling or stopping a cast. holinka 
We like this direction, but it's probably too much for 5.4.7. We plan on reverting the change. holinka 

Would it be possible to allow fury warriors to wield a 2 hander and a one hander at the same time??
It's already possible, but we don't tune it to be viable or plan to. Not as cool theme to it. Celestalon 
Why can't arms wield 2x 1handers for shows?
If just for show is all you want, you can respec Fury...? Celestalon 


Patch 5.4.7 - Alterac Valley Map Changes
@AlteracValley shared  some images of some tweaks made to the Horde base in Patch 5.4.7. The hill that allows you to jump the fence into the base and the gap between the fence and tower entering the back of the baseare now gone, adding chokepoints for the Horde to take advantage of. 

We can take a look next month and see if these map tweaks help  the Horde win some more Alterac Valley games.


    


Warlords of Draenor Pre-Orders
While there hasn't been any announcement about WoD Pre-orders or mention of Level 90 Boosts in the official patch notes yet, Rygarius hinted  that more information is coming soon!
