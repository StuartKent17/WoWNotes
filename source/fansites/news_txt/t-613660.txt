Small update tonight, just like any other friday night we might see a new patch on beta servers. Stay tuned !

Beta Realms - Maintenance 9/5/08
We will be taking down the Beta realms at 10:30AM Pacific time today September 5th 2008 for maintenance.

We expect this process to take from six to eight hours.
We're going to try to patch today. 
Icecrown, the exterior zone, will be shipped out with the expansion. Icecrown Citadel, the dungeon/raid experience, will be part of a future patch. 
Storm Peaks will be in this patch. If it continues to crash the server, we'll have to turn it off again.


Premade Characters
Premades weren't supposed to be active today
Actually, the premades being available on the existing realms was a mistake. They are being removed. There will be a specific premade realm. Source 

Premade Realm
Murmur will be the new Premade realm. Premades will be removed from "Northrend" and "Lich King" Source 

XP Tuning
The XP tuning is getting closer. We're going to do a minor adjustment in today's patch. 10% faster.
