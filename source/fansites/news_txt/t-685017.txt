Boubouille2009-12-21, 12:26 AMRealm First Achievements Changes
This change is a few weeks old but as far as I know I never reported it and a blue posted something about it on the customer support forums. You can no longer get a Realm First achievement if you just transfered on a server! 
Any player who has been on the realm for longer than 60 days is entitled to a realm first achievement. In this particular case, the matter was investigated thoroughly for all parties involved and everyone who was entitled to the achievement should now have received it.

The reason it was changed was to stop players practise on one realm then transfer over to a newer realm and get the achievement, potentially blocking the players on that realm who have been there longer earning it themselves.

Buy an Authenticator on the US Store

We, TheSpeedGamers, are a group of gamers who play video games to raise money for different causes. We have been a group for nearly two years now and have raised approximately $100,000 for various causes.
Our events typically last 72 hours in which we broadcast ourselves playing video games while also giving commentary. There is a chat room that accompanies the video game feed so that the viewers can interact with the players and each other. Three games will be featured at a time, we will rotate the games being shown. Everything can be viewed on TheSpeedGamers.com.

During the Pokemon marathon we will be raising money for Ally’s House while trying to catch all 493 Pokemon. There will be a counter so that the viewers can keep track of how many Pokemon we have caught.
Donations will be gathered using a chip in widget; debit, credit cards and paypal can be used to donate.

All Pokemon must be caught within TheSpeedGamer’s house, no trades will be done to outsiders,
