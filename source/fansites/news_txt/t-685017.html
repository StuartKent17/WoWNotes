This change is a few weeks old but as far as I know I never reported it and a blue posted something about it on the customer support forums. You can no longer get a Realm First achievement if you just transfered on a server! <br>
Any player who has been on the realm for longer than 60 days is entitled to a realm first achievement. In this particular case, the matter was investigated thoroughly for all parties involved and everyone who was entitled to the achievement should now have received it.<br>
<br>
The reason it was changed was to stop players practise on one realm then transfer over to a newer realm and get the achievement, potentially blocking the players on that realm who have been there longer earning it themselves. <br>

Core Hound Pup - Updated Video<br>
Someone pointed out that I never posted a video of the Core Hound Pup in Patch 3.3, this is now fixed! You can get the Core Hound Pup by linking your Battle.net account to an authenticator.<br>
<br>
Buy an Authenticator on the US Store (http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=1100000822)<br>
Buy an Authenticator on the EU Store (http://eu.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=221003617)<br>
Buy an Authenticator for your phone on the Mobile Store (http://mobile.blizzard.com/)<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that buying an authenticator is always a good idea. <br>

The MMO Report: Thursday, December 17th<br>
The MMO Report (http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/tag/3321/The-MMO-Report.html) is a weekly podcast by G4 TV (http://g4tv.com/). They mentioned MMO-Champion in this week&apos;s episode (yes, that&apos;s all it takes to make me happy) and I might post it more often depending on users feedback ... It&apos;s always useful to know what&apos;s going on in the MMO world, ask for it and it will be back. <br>

Details regarding the 72 hour Pokemon Marathon that starts on December 18th at 6 pm cst:<br>
We, TheSpeedGamers, are a group of gamers who play video games to raise money for different causes. We have been a group for nearly two years now and have raised approximately $100,000 for various causes.<br>
Our events typically last 72 hours in which we broadcast ourselves playing video games while also giving commentary. There is a chat room that accompanies the video game feed so that the viewers can interact with the players and each other. Three games will be featured at a time, we will rotate the games being shown. Everything can be viewed on TheSpeedGamers.com.<br>
<br>
During the Pokemon marathon we will be raising money for Ally&#x2019;s House while trying to catch all 493 Pokemon. There will be a counter so that the viewers can keep track of how many Pokemon we have caught.<br>
Donations will be gathered using a chip in widget; debit, credit cards and paypal can be used to donate.<br>
<br>
Gaming Rules:<br>
All Pokemon must be caught within TheSpeedGamer&#x2019;s house, no trades will be done to outsiders,<br>
All pokemon that are only attainable through events only will be pre-loaded onto one of the carts.<br>
Games being played: Fire Red, Leaf Green, Heart Gold, Soul Silver, Ruby, Sapphire, Diamond, Pearl.<br>
