As we previously announced, free character moves will become available in this region very soon. When these free character moves open, player-characters at any level will be able to move:<br>
<br>
From -&gt; To<br>
<br>
Arugal -&gt; Felstriker<br>
Faerlina -&gt; Heartseeker (new realm)<br>
Stalagg -&gt; Heartseeker (new realm)<br>
Herod -&gt; Earthfury (new realm)<br>
Skeram -&gt; Earthfury (new realm)<br>
Incendius -&gt; Netherwind<br>
Thalnos -&gt; Netherwind<br>
Fairbanks -&gt; Arcanite Reaper (new realm)<br>
Whitemane -&gt; Arcanite Reaper (new realm)<br>
Bigglesworth -&gt; Anathema<br>
Pagle -&gt; Windseeker<br>
Grobbulus -&gt; Deviate Delight<br>
<br>
<br>
For approximately one day, the new realms will be restricted to only those players using a free character move. After one day, any player may create new characters there. This is to allow players using the free character move service a better chance at retaining the name of the character they&#x2019;re moving.<br>
<br>
We will let you know when the new realms open and free character moves are enabled.<br>
<br>
Thank you!</div></div>
