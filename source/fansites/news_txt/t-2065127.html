With Azeroth on the brink of destruction, heroes from around the world were summoned to drive back the Burning Legion&#x2019;s armies last week with the launch of World of Warcraft&#xAE;: Legion&#x2122;, the sixth expansion to Blizzard Entertainment&#x2019;s acclaimed massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Today, Blizzard announced that players have forged a truly formidable defensive front&#x2014;as of the expansion&#x2019;s first full day of launch on August 30, more than 3.3 million copies of Legion had sold through, matching the all-time record achieved by previous expansions and making it one of the fastest-selling PC games ever. In addition, World of Warcraft&#x2019;s launch-week player concurrency climbed to its highest point since the 2010 launch of the Cataclysm expansion, as champions from around the world united to strike a mighty first blow against the fel invaders. But the battle has only just begun. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s been a thrill to see players hunting demons, powering up Artifacts, and freely exploring all the new zones in Legion,&#x201D; said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. &#x201C;We worked hard to make this the best World of Warcraft expansion yet, and we look forward to providing players with even more content as Legion&#x2019;s epic story unfolds in the months ahead.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
While players are currently entrenched against the first wave of demonic invaders, Legion&#x2019;s next exciting chapter is already in the works. Last weekend at PAX West, Blizzard unveiled new details on the expansion&#x2019;s upcoming first major content update, Patch 7.1: Return to Karazhan, featuring a reimagined version of one of World of Warcraft&apos;s most popular raids. Players will explore a sprawling five-player Mythic dungeon, facing familiar foes from Karazhan&#x2019;s past&#x2014;and encountering plenty of surprises and twists along the way. The update also features a new set of quests unfolding over multiple weeks in the fallen night elf city of Suramar, as well as a brand-new raid: the Trial of Valor, which sends players deep into the vrykul underworld of Helheim. <br>

<br>
Barrage (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/120360-barrage) now fires in a tighter cone, and its visual has been improved to better show its area of effect.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; Notes-- Barrage fulfills a fantasy of a wild spray of shots in a large area. Of course, that can be dangerous, and often Hunters accidentally pull additional enemies with Barrage, especially in Legion dungeons. We saw this as a failure on our part to convey what it actually does. This hotfix should allow Hunters to get a feel for the shape and size of it and build a reliable expectation of what will happen when they cast Barrage. No change was made to Barrage&#x2019;s damage. We hope that this helps Hunters and their groupmates to have a more pleasant dungeon experience.<br>

Yep! We&apos;ll continue to adjust class tuning as needed, and are closely monitoring how each spec is performing. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/773663291897892864))<br>

Why doesn&apos;t Mark of Ursol count as AM for mechanics like first boss of Vault of the Wardens? Odd to use Ironfur vs magic dmg<br>
We focused on consistency for that type of check in Legion, but agree that Mark of Ursol seems weird. Will discuss! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/773662685430808576))<br>

Ignite is spreading to neutral targets during combat. Intended? Makes for interesting fights in Eye of Aszhara<br>

Hey guys, can you pls confirm if Driven to Madness (Talent) is supposed to only work outside VF<br>
Intentional. Driven to Madness only grants Insanity from non-periodic damage taken outside of Voidform. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/773672328358076416))<br>

if we active the orbs &amp; down kosumoth to unlock the WQto get the pet this week will we have to do it again to get the mount?<br>

did you increase the honor level required for 840+ rewards? back to 805 after seeing 840 for a bit.<br>
Works like all other world quest rewards. They are not predetermined. But your chance at better loot increases with honor level. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/773361585536372736))<br>
<br>
Loving Legion, great job so far. Can you confirm the ilvl threshold that you must be over to get the small % stat increase? 850?<br>

Can Oddly Shaped Stomachs go in leatherworking bags please?<br>
Good suggestion. This will be fixed in Patch 7.1. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/773285228257259520))<br>
<br>
is infernal brimstone WQ supposed to be weekly or daily? Killed that should be up today but nothing popped up.<br>
On average, you&apos;ll see it every three days. This is also true for the Felwort, Felhide, and Bacon World Quests. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/773663697621295104))<br>
<br>
will professions continue to upgrade past 850 with new content patches or is that going to be limit for gear from them?<br>
Yep. In fact, we plan to increase the Obliterum cap to 855 in Patch 7.1. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/773663970867556353))<br>
<br>
Rank 3 Skinning providing no improvement over Rank 1. Intended?<br>
Ranks 2 and 3 both give a chance at an additional skin/scale. Rank 2 also gives a chance for Blood of Sargeras. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/773664174425518080))</div></div>
