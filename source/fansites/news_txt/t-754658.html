Cataclysm Beta - Build 12857 (Codename Ninja)<br>
A new beta build has been deploye... Actually, no, a new build appeared out of nowhere and was never deployed on beta servers. I have absolutely no idea why, but, hey, it&apos;s still a beta build! <br>
<br>
Disclaimer - This build is NOT ON BETA SERVERS, I have no way to confirm strange values by checking in-game and a lot of temporary stuff might be there. I strongly suggest that you don&apos;t even try to complain about changes in this build on official forums, and if you plan to do it, you&apos;d better do it in a very nice and constructive way if you don&apos;t want to get your ass kicked. <br>
Disclaimer #2 - Most of the tooltips don&apos;t work for the moment. Working on it.<br>
