Mastery: Nature's Guardian http://www.wowdb.com/spells/159195-mastery-natures-guardian once again gives 1% Attack Power per point, as intended.
Nature's Guardian doesn't increase healing from Hand of the Protector, Ysera's Gift self, Cleansing Waters, or Judgments of the Pure.

Developers’ notes: Heals that scale with the Guardian's maximum health already benefit from Mastery, so further increasing their healing was "double-dipping" Mastery.

Developers’ notes: We recently identified a bug that was causing Discipline Priests to gain far more benefit than intended from caster DPS trinkets. While we do intend for Discipline to benefit from caster DPS trinkets including through Atonement, and will be tuning those appropriately, we are slightly increasing the spec’s damage to account for the bug fix. We will continue monitoring the issue.

Developers’ notes: This does not reduce Wellspring's effective non-overheal healing. In the future we plan to find a different solution, but we felt it was it was better to address the interaction between Wellspring overhealing and Cloudburst Totem now, rather than wait to change it after it got more use.

Havoc PvP Stat Assignment Adjustments:

Agility reduced by 10%
Mastery reduced by 60%
Critical Strike increased by 30%
Haste increased by 30%

Developers’ note: Havoc Demon Hunter damage overall was quite high, so we reduced the amount of Agility they receive in PvP. We also felt that their Mastery contributed too much to excessive burst, so we’ve redistributed their secondary stat budget, reducing their Mastery, but increasing their Critical Strike and Haste.
