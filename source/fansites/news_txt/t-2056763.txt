Demon Hunters can no longer go beyond the expected boundaries of the Temple of Kotmogu battleground.


 Druid Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Lunar Strike  splash damage increased to 35% of initial damage was 18%.
Mastery: Nature's Guardian  once again gives 1% Attack Power per point, as intended.
Nature's Guardian doesn't increase healing from Hand of the Protector, Ysera's Gift self, Cleansing Waters, or Judgments of the Pure.

Developers’ notes: Heals that scale with the Guardian's maximum health already benefit from Mastery, so further increasing their healing was "double-dipping" Mastery.



 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Exhilaration  Marksmanship now heals the Hunter for 30% of maximum health and the Hunter’s pet for 100%.
Volley  now deals additional damage at 100% of Attack Power was 75%.
Murder of Crows  Marksmanship now deals damage equal to 162% of Attack Power was 135%.


 Mage Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Frostbolt  damage increased to 185% of Spell Power was 170%.
Flurry  damage increased to 105% of Spell Power was 90%.


 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Aura Mastery  Aura of Sacrifice replicates 15% of effective healing was 10%.


 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Penance  damage is now 190% of Spell Power was 175%.
The Penitent  now heals 300% of Spell Power was 275%.
Shadow Word: Pain  Discipline damage increased by 7%.
Purge the Wicked  additional damage increased to 48% of Spell Power was 42%.
Dominant Mind  cooldown reduced to 2 minutes was 3 minutes.
Schism  now deals damage equal to 425% of Spell Power was 400%.

Developers’ notes: We recently identified a bug that was causing Discipline Priests to gain far more benefit than intended from caster DPS trinkets. While we do intend for Discipline to benefit from caster DPS trinkets including through Atonement, and will be tuning those appropriately, we are slightly increasing the spec’s damage to account for the bug fix. We will continue monitoring the issue.

Run Through  damage reduced to 142% of Attack Power was 150%.
Between the Eyes  damage reduced to 85% of Attack Power was 88.5%.
Mastery: Potent Poisons  now provides a damage bonus of 4% per point was 3.5% and a bonus to Agonizing Poison of 2.0% per point was 1.75%.
Elaborate Planning  now makes your finishing move grant a 15% bonus to damage was 12%.


 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Unleash Life  increases your next heal by 45% was 30%.
Wellspring  now heals for 375% of Spell Power was 300%.
Wellspring heals for 25% of normal value on full-health targets, if it has more than 6 targets.

Developers’ notes: This does not reduce Wellspring's effective non-overheal healing. In the future we plan to find a different solution, but we felt it was it was better to address the interaction between Wellspring overhealing and Cloudburst Totem now, rather than wait to change it after it got more use.

Drain Life  now does damage of 35% of Spell Power per tick was 30%.
Drain Soul  now does damage of 52% of Spell Power per tick was 44%.
Haunt  damage increased to 700% of Spell Power was 600%.
Incinerate  damage increased to 210% of Spell Power was 190%.


Event

Players should now be able to see Archmage Khadgar during the quest “City Under Siege” without leaving Dalaran and returning.


Hardware

Implemented a fix for a bug that was causing a loss of sound with Creative SoundBlaster Audigy SE sound cards.


Player Versus Player
The following adjustments only apply to PvP abilities when used in PvP.

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator

Havoc PvP Stat Assignment Adjustments:

Agility reduced by 10%
Mastery reduced by 60%
Critical Strike increased by 30%
Haste increased by 30%

Developers’ note: Havoc Demon Hunter damage overall was quite high, so we reduced the amount of Agility they receive in PvP. We also felt that their Mastery contributed too much to excessive burst, so we’ve redistributed their secondary stat budget, reducing their Mastery, but increasing their Critical Strike and Haste.


Glimpse  Havoc now grants 3 seconds of Blur was 1.5 seconds.
Awaken the Demon  Havoc now grants 6 seconds of Metamorphosis was 8 seconds.
