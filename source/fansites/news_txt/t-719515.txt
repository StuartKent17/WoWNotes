Female Worgen Preview Pictures
Blizzard just released a couple of screenshots of the ... female worgen! That's not really what I asked for my birthday yes, it is! but I guess that works. 

Important - These models are a work in progress and they might not reflect the final appearance of female worgens in game.

US PTR Testing Schedule
The US PTR is testing again tomorrow.
Now that the 3.3.5 patch is available for PTR testing, we wanted to have a round of focus testing for Ruby Sanctum. Only normal mode will be available, with Heroic testing to occur at a later date. 

Everything related to this zone is implemented for this test, please note any issues with the trash creatures and sub-bosses, loot, achievements, and quests. 

US Testing Schedule: 
Thursday, May 20 starting at 19:00 EDT. 

We plan to allow testing for an extended period. However since this is the Test Realm, unforeseen issues could delay or cancel testing at any time.
