Patch 3.1.2 - Battle-Bots
Patch 3.1.2 will include a new mini-pet, the Battle-Bot. We don't have many details on these bots for the moment but it looks like they will have a couple of abilities and will use multiple types of fuel. 
Battle-Bot - Right Click to summon and dismiss your Battle-Bot
Blue Battle Fuel - Fill up your Battle-Bot with blue fuel.
Red Battle Fuel - Fill up your Battle-Bot with red fuel.

Class changes in future patches
All I meant was that 3.2's list of class changes will probably be much smaller than 3.1. We will still make class changes. I was speaking more to those players who feel like they can't even get a feel for how things work because they changed in 3.0, maybe even 3.09 and 3.1.

Patch 3.2 class changes
Some classes probably do need buffs. Other players are losing some Arena matches or are not at the tops of damage meters and are laying all of the blame at our feet instead of asking if there is anything they can do better.

I did say we would keep changing numbers though. My message was more for players, like the OP, who feel like they don't have a chance to get a feel for how all of the mechanics are working because they change so frequently. I would not expect that rate of change to continue. I didn't say the game was done.

There are a few classes or specs that will probably continue to see more changes than others. DKs as a new class have 5 years of player history to catch up to. The Ret rotation is something we already said we'd like to evolve further.

TLDR: don't expect 3.2 to have a list of class changes as epic as 3.1. Sometimes you guys make it hard to say anything because our comments are so over-interpreted. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16903630918-can-we-get-a-break-from-patches---plzzzzzzz.html
