http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/gb-en.png Free Character Migrations Available EU
If you're on one of the source realms listed below, you can move your characters to one of the designated destination realms and avoid the queues—for free!

By initiating one of these transfers, you will be moving your character to a new realm and home. This is a one-time, one-way move. If you wish to move your character elsewhere, you will need to use the paid transfer service https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/services/pct-select.html?.


Silvermoon => Magtheridon / Azuremyst
Kazzak / Outland / Stormscale => Auchindoun


Please be aware that, due to the unpredictable nature of free transfers, we may close down any Free Character Migrations at any time and without warning if the target realm becomes full. If you plan to move with friends or your guild, we suggest that you coordinate the effort to reduce the chance of any stragglers being left behind.

Early closures aside, this set of Free Character Migrations will end on Tuesday, March 11

Begin a Free Character Migration now https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/fcm/character-list.html?r=EU&l=WoW1! We recommend reviewing the FAQ https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/free-character-migration, as it details what is or isn't allowed for transferred characters.
