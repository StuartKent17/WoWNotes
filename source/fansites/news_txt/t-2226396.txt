Addon - Immersion
Immersion https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/257550-immersion is an addon that provides a more immersive quest text frame. It uses the talking heads system to display quest text, but still allows you to skip things when you are in a hurry.

Blizzard and Professionalism
The WoW forums have always been a place of back and forths between CMs, Devs, and Players, and I've watched the back and forths between Lore, Kalgan, Tigole, Bashiok, Eyonix, Tseric, etc and our players for years, and I just want to be clear that we don't consider this anything new. I think it's what makes our forums a fun place while discussing serious issues. I'm appreciative of the overall conversation, though, and I've read through all of it, both on here and /r/wow, throughout the day.

My post in question was directed at a snarky player on the "there's no content" train who hadn't touched a good amount of Legion's content, including LFR, minus a wing of Nighthold. My comment to the player was only pointing out facts, albeit in a snarky way not unknown to the forums.

I think folks have gotten confused by the message on both sides. If you tell me, "There's nothing to do in Legion!" I'll tell you that's a lie, flat out. If you tell me, "There's nothing for *me* to do in Legion!" or "Nothing in this patch makes me want to play!" that's a topic I think we can discuss. Now, the post in question was the former, and, as said, in an attempt to be catty towards me, that comment was made. It's easy to delete a comment and move on, but it takes a lot more willpower to engage in a conversation, call out false statements even if done half-assedly in a joking manner, and try to engage on the real issue.

Our team is not part of Customer Service, and we don't necessarily adhere to the same levels of 'professionalism' that they may in their day-to-day, and, even when we do, it's very much relaxed as it is in most of the industry. Not trying to put down our Customer Service compatriots in any way, they do a stellar job, I just think its important to note that our teams goals are different. My goal here is first and foremost engagement and community-building, and I'm given free rein to do that as I see fit albeit to my own pleasure and detriment. I appreciate everyone here who talks about their time in CS roles, I've had some experience in them myself, and I understand the difference of the role vs the audience in both capacities.

An interesting note, but I don't see our team as 'professional', in the sense that we uphold ourselves to some golden, glorious, corporate standard. I consider us 'experts' in our crafts, but nothing more than players who sit at the developer's table who have been given blue text and sometime receive emails with information that you may not see.

So GD's righteous indignation is chasing off another Blizzard employee? The only one that still posts here?
No one's chasing me off, don't worry.

I think we can all stand to take and throw a few punches, and we'll all get along better if we have a bit of fun. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1062254-blizzard-and-professionalism/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20754917221?page=9#172
