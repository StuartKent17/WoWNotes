Patch 6.0.3 Hotfixes - January 27
Garrisons, Followers, and Outposts

Tier 3 Garrisons: Dungeoneer's Training Dummy for healing and damage have swapped places so melee classes are less likely to trigger the tanking dummy by accident.
Garrison Campaign Quests

Assault on Skettis: Creatures and NPCs associated with Assault on Skettis now respawn more frequently and increased the amount of morale awarded for defeating them.
Gladiator's Sanctum Level 3: Players can no longer be votekicked from the Coliseum scenario.
Primal Fury: Players that have completed the quest before the hotfix from January 21 should now correctly receive Thisalee Crow Alliance or Choluna Horde as a Follower.

Ferocious Bite no longer loses damage when cast with a low amount of Energy while Berserk is active. Berserk will still discount Cat Form abilities' Energy cost, but will include the bonus damage as if it weren't cast with Berserk active.


Feral

Leader of the Pack should now correctly trigger its heal for Druids that have learned the talent, Claws of Shirvallah.


Talents

Incarnation: Tree of Life's bonuses should no longer be incorrectly retained without having the talent learned.
Nature's Vigil should no longer be dealing excessive damage to high level targets by healing low level NPCs.

The Shadow Gate: Players who became stuck after completing "The Shadow Gate" will need to re-enter the cave within the Bloodmaul Stronghold in Frostfire Ridge if they were unable to see Orlana Strongbrow to continue their quest series.


Gorgrond

Ambushing the Enemy: Resolved an issue where players were unable to complete this quest if The Giant Cauldron has been completed first.


Talador

At Your Command: Horde characters who have faction changed to Alliance should now be able to complete the quest "At Your Command" if they have completed the Alliance version previously.


Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios

Auchindoun

Grom'tash the Destructor and Gul'kosh should no longer force all party members into combat, including ones that aren't actively in combat with them.


Shadowmoon Burial Grounds

Level 1 Heirloom Mount
Collecting all heirloom items awards a special mount usable by level 1 characters.

Does this mean we need the fishing event BoA for this mount? When I won it I took the trinket that turns you into a fish.
I've asked about that and was informed that the achievement involves collecting a number of heirlooms not all of them. Working on getting clarification on the Heirloom collections tab and will be updating the 6.1 PTR Patch Notes with more concrete information once it's available.

Ashran Timing Hotfix
As you've probably witnessed, on many servers Ashran had digressed into a situation where the two factions were avoiding any confrontation. One faction would complete the outer events while the other faction would kill the faction leader. This isn't ideal, as the Horde and Alliance should be fighting more regularly in Ashran. 

Recently, we made changes to the frequency of events and the time between battles in the middle road. After a boss is killed, the center lane will take 30 minutes to reset. We hope this encourages the team that just won the middle lane to venture off into the rest of the zone for a time before the fight begins anew. Furthermore, we hope that factionâ€™s presence in the outer events will encourage the other faction to fight in the center lane a bit more, since winning the events is no longer a given.

We'll continue to consider your constructive Ashran feedback and appreciate those of you providing it. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/359433-2nd-blizzard-hotfix-without-warning/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16016273468?page=2#34
