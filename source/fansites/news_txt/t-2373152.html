Amongst the data for the Battle for Azeroth Alpha is the text forms of the new /flirt and /silly emotes for the Zandalari Trolls. We previewed the voiceovers for the Dark Iron Dwarves&apos; /flirt and /silly yesterday, but the Zandalari Troll voiceover versions are not in the game files yet.<br>
<br>
Zandalari Troll Male &apos;/Silly&apos;<br>
How loa can you go-a?<br>
Ha! You call DAT a ship? DIS is a ship!<br>
Troll healers have such an easy job. All dey ever say is &quot;Regenerate, den call me in de morning.&quot;<br>
Psst! Can you keep a secret? I&apos;m not a fan of dark magic. My collection of skulls and fetishes is purely decorative. Hehe!<br>
I don&apos;t mean to brag, but we have an entire city made of gold. Dose other trolls live in huts. HUTS!<br>
Need to name a city? Do what we do and put &quot;Zul&quot; in front of a random word.<br>
<br>
Zandalari Troll Female &apos;/Silly&apos;<br>
What makes de Zandalari superior? Two words: good posture.<br>
Evolution? Pfft. If you ask me, elves are a giant step backwards.<br>
Isle of Thunder, you say? Nope, never heard of it. Next question...<br>
Do not feel bad. To be honest, I cannot keep all dose loa straight either.<br>
Elves? Humans? No thanks. I cannot trust any race with dat many toes.<br>
Orcs call dose little teeth sticking out of their mouths tusks? Dat. Is. Adorable.<br>
<br>
Zandalari Troll Male &apos;/Flirt&apos;<br>
De ladies call me... Zanda-licious, baby!<br>
Other guys might put you on a pedestal, but I will put you atop a pyramid.<br>
I am en-raptored by your eyes.<br>
Are you casting a spell? Because I have a fetish for you.<br>
I may stand upright, but I know how to get down.<br>
Is Krag&apos;wa nearby? Because I want to leap into your arms.<br>
<br>
Zandalari Troll Female &apos;/Flirt&apos;<br>
I am a proud woman of Zandalar. I do not date slouches.<br>
Only an insecure troll brags about the size of his tusks.<br>
If you liked it, then you should have put a nose ring on it.<br>
You could say I am a double threat... hexy AND sexy!<br>
It does not take a love potion to win me over... but it couldn&apos;t hurt your chances.<br>
We should sail away to a deserted island and... get to know each other better.<br>
<br>
<br>
Battle for Azeroth Broadcast Text<br>
Here is some initial Broadcast Text datamining for the newest Battle for Azeroth build. Note that this not nearly complete, and we&apos;ll be adding more later. There&apos;s also a lot of placeholder text in the data; we&apos;ve included a few of those lines because they give a quick picture of what is happening with the story.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: Our enemies remain one step ahead of us. We must close that gap.<br>
Unknown_Male: The time has come to call upon old allies in distant lands, and to see the true might of the Alliance made whole again.<br>
Unknown_Male: Pack your bags and report to Stormwind Keep immediately. You&apos;re headed for Kul Tiras.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Female: The Horde has just run wild through Stormwind and you want to send me home?!<br>
Unknown_Female: We should head for Zandalar immediately and deliver those animals to justice!<br>
Unknown_Male: Underestimating our enemy has already cost us enough lives.<br>
Unknown_Male: There is now a more important task at hand, Jaina. Something only you can do.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Female: My king, the Lady Jaina&apos;s ship is ready to set sail.<br>
Unknown_Male: Thank you, admiral. This hero will be joining her.<br>
Unknown_Male: Kul Tiras must pledge their fleet to the Alliance. Can I count on you, Jaina?<br>
Unknown_Female: I will see it done. I will do anything to defeat the Horde.<br>
Unknown_Male: &lt;Sigh.&gt; That is what I am afraid of...<br>
<br>
Unknown_EitherGender	[Loading screen -&gt; IGC sail through Boralus main canal &amp; meet Katherine scene.]<br>
Unknown_EitherGender	[IGC - Katherine rejects Jaina and exiles her. Player is arrested.]<br>
Unknown_EitherGender	[Player wakes up in Boralus Prison. ~10m of gameplay as they break out with Flynn. Taelia brings them to a safehouse in the harbor.]<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: The beasts bar the way. Cut through them!<br>
Unknown_Male: There appears to be a structure in the distance. That must be where Jaina was headed!<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: I suspected the marshal might be here for that reason, though I&apos;d keep your voice down when mentioning that name around here...<br>
Unknown_Male: If he has need of me, I&apos;ll follow his orders, but it would be dereliction to leave without thining out these beasts a hair.<br>
Unknown_Male: Take up a crossbow and assist me, mainlander!<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: That is a risk I must take, Captain. Soldiers, on me.<br>
Unknown_Female: I have a feeling they&apos;re not going to open that gate for us when we return...<br>
Unknown_Male: We will find a way, Mace, once we find Jaina. Thoughts, Yorrick?<br>
Unknown_Male: It&apos;s likely she would&apos;ve followed the road to look for shelter.<br>
Unknown_Male: Very well, that&apos;s where we will begin.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: Halt! What is this?<br>
Unknown_Female: It looks like there are more than beasts in these woods. Do you think an exile did this?<br>
Unknown_Male: I wish I could believe they did. No, I think there&apos;s something much darker at work here.<br>
Unknown_Male: Come, we should keep moving.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Female: Ashvane won&apos;t be happy about your little stunt. There are probably bounty hunters looking for you as we speak.<br>
Unknown_Female: You&apos;ll be safe in the market, though. They wouldn&apos;t dare try anything here.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Female: This place stinks of the forsaken. I don&apos;t know how long these walls will hold, so we should keep moving.<br>
Unknown_Male: You are right. Sylvanas did not have much time to prepare for this attack, but we cannot underestimate her.<br>
Unknown_Male: Everyone, fall into position. We strike on my command!<br>
Unknown_Male: Genn, I need you to cover our flank. It is too risky to funnel everyone through the side of the keep at once; there could be traps.<br>
Unknown_Male: Yes, Anduin. I will watch for her arrival.<br>
Unknown_Female: Let&apos;s move.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Female: Kul Tiras is made up of many houses, but the real power is split between Proudmoore and Ashvane.<br>
Unknown_Female: House Proudmoore runs the military. The city guard and marines all answer to Lord Admiral Katherine Proudmoore. Technically, she rules the entire nation.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Female: House Ashvane controls the nation&apos;s wealth. The Ashvane Company holds all of the official state contracts for trade and production.<br>
Unknown_Female: Pretty much everybody works for them in one way or another. Even the gangs.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Female: This market is full of travelers from all over Azeroth, so it&apos;s heavily guarded.<br>
Unknown_Female: Still, I want to introduce you to a few folks you can trust. In case anything happens.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: Brothers and sisters of the Alliance, hear me now!<br>
Unknown_Male: We are standing the precipice of glory!<br>
Unknown_Male: Today, we will claim our victory over the Eastern Kingdoms and take back that which has been stolen from us so long ago.<br>
Unknown_Male: We stand as one in solidarity for those who were lost at the battle for Teldrassil - for the families who have lost their homelands.<br>
Unknown_Male: With this act of war, it is clear that we must fight for the survival of our next hundred generations.<br>
Unknown_Male: FOR THE ALLIANCE!<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: The dead are rising! We must evacuate the wounded!<br>
Unknown_Male: The blight is far too dangerous, my king! We must focus on the living!<br>
Unknown_Male: The Alliance leaves no soldier behind!<br>
Unknown_Male: Not this time...<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: Is that all you&apos;ve got, Banshee Queen?!<br>
Unknown_Female: Ahhhh, what have we here? Has the Lion of Stormwind finally come out to play? You have no idea what you&apos;re up against, boy king. We have only just begun!<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: Our siege machines are lost; we have not yet breached the wall. My king, I...<br>
Unknown_Male: Father, help me. I need your guidance. I need... a miracle.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: Alright, move out! We have more of this place to scout, and we can&apos;t get ourselves ambushed again.<br>
Unknown_Female: I don&apos;t think that&apos;s our fault, boss, given that we were attacked by a group that wasn&apos;t supposed to be here.<br>
Unknown_Male: We should&apos;ve seen the attack coming. Who was supposed to be the lookout?<br>
Unknown_Male: It was Tucker. The sethrak killed him first.<br>
Unknown_Male: Tucker! Should have known. At least he paid the price for his incompetence.<br>
Unknown_Male: Keep it down! Lady Sylvanas won&apos;t be happy if we fail our mission.<br>
Unknown_Female: Is she ever happy, boss?<br>
Unknown_Male: She will be if we do our jobs properly, Ingrid.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: Warriors of the Horde! Today we rise--axes and blades--thirsting for the blood of our enemies.<br>
Unknown_Male: Ready your blades! Lok-tar ogar!<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: It is you who is outnumbered now.<br>
Unknown_Female: That army is enormous... Give the word and I will abscond us to safety.<br>
Unknown_Male: We must be willing to fight! To die for what we believe in!<br>
Unknown_Male: Time is up for you, Prince Anduin!<br>
Unknown_Male: VICTORY TO THE FORSAKEN!<br>
Unknown_Male: ALLIANCE, HOLD YOUR GROUND!<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: Well, well, well! It looks like the Horde have finally decided to show their ugly mugs!<br>
Unknown_Male: Not half as ugly as you, Muradin Bronzebeard!<br>
Unknown_Male: We need resources to hold them off. Spread out! We&apos;re bringing the war to them.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Female: The horde is falling back again? What is their strategy here?<br>
Unknown_Male: That damned blight blocks our path. Our forces can&apos;t follow her.<br>
Unknown_Male: The Alliance gains no victory if the Warchief escapes. Capturing her is the only way to win this war.<br>
Unknown_Female: Understood. We will not let you go alone.<br>
Unknown_Male: Mekkatorque, can your gyrocopters get us past this blight?<br>
Unknown_Male: I do not have many, but my machines are at your disposal.<br>
Unknown_Male: So be it. Champions - with me. Mekkatorque, backtrack through the keep with the rest of our forces, and station them at Brill. Be ready to strike on my command.<br>
Unknown_Male: You&apos;ve got it.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: Soldiers of the Horde, hear me!<br>
Unknown_Male: The Undercity is not safe. We need your help evacuating its citizens!<br>
Unknown_Male: As you know, SI:7 spies have been lurking in our cities. They are among us now as we speak.<br>
Unknown_Male: We&apos;ve isolated their location to the Mage District and locked down the rest of the Undercity.<br>
Unknown_Male: You are to flush them out of hiding, eliminate them, and get our civilians to safety in Orgrimmar. Lok&apos;tar ogar!<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: A hundred years ago, all o&apos; dis land you see before ya belonged to da trolls.<br>
Unknown_Male: Today, it belongs to da Horde!<br>
<br>
Unknown_Female: These are Alliance lands! Swift retribution shall come to these Horde imposters that challenge us!<br>
Unknown_Male: Pfah! You can choke on your retribution, admiral!<br>
Unknown_Male: We need resources to hold them off. Spread out! We&apos;re bringing the war to them.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: Well, well, well! It looks like the Horde have finally decided to show their ugly mugs!<br>
Unknown_Male: Ugly or not... we be comin&apos; for ya, Muradin.<br>
Unknown_Male: Strike hard and strike fast, bruddas and sistahs. Dese Alliance won&apos;t know what hit &apos;em.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Female: These are Alliance lands! Swift retribution shall come to these Horde imposters that challenge us!<br>
Unknown_Male: All o&apos; dis been troll lands long before you Allies even knew it was here, Admiral.<br>
Unknown_Male: Strike hard and strike fast, bruddas and sistahs. Dese Alliance won&apos;t know what hit &apos;em.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Female: I tried to warn you. You intrude on Alliance territory, and now you set up camp.<br>
Unknown_Female: Alliance! Prepare to march!<br>
<br>
Unknown_Female: Very well. If you want war, then you shall have your war. Send a mounted battalion to take them out!<br>
Unknown_Male: Our defenses are still weak. Horde troops, return to base and defend our position!<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: Mortar teams! Blow their fortress to the ground. To the ground!<br>
Unknown_Male: Dey tink a few dwarven explosives gonna stop us? Hah! Show &apos;em what de Horde is made of!<br>
<br>
Unknown_Female: Very well. If you want war, then you shall have your war. Send a mounted battalion to take them out!<br>
Unknown_Male: Dey tink a few soldiers on horseback gonna stop us? Hah! Show &apos;em what de Horde is made of!<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: Admiral Rogers! We&apos;ve stormed your fortress. Where is your retribution now, paladin?<br>
Unknown_Female: The Light is still with me. I will not fall so easily!<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: Knock knock, little Bronzebeard. Anybody home?<br>
Unknown_Male: Hell yeah there is... my hammer!<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: Stromgarde has fallen. Surrender now, Rogers, and save your skin.<br>
Unknown_Female: The Light is still with me. I will not fall so easily!<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: Hear our call, fallen. Your wicked deeds are forgiven this day.<br>
Unknown_Male: Return to the storm and know peace. Flow through the Shrine so we might share your strength.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: No time to waste! Follow Baine with your weapons drawn!<br>
Unknown_Male: The Alliance will make it no further! CHARGE!<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: Wisps are dangerous only in large numbers, can we kill enough them Warchief?<br>
Unknown_Female: Not enough to matter. But we can disperse them.<br>
Unknown_Female: Saurfang, take some of our troops and go into Felwood. Find or make path over the mountain into Darkshore, but leave the siege weapons under my command.<br>
Unknown_Female: We will squeeze Malfurion from both sides.<br>
Unknown_Male: How many smugglers do you know, Blightcaller?<br>
Unknown_Male: I beg your pardon?<br>
Unknown_Male: I am not so naive to believe that Everlook gets all of its cargo via ship routes from Azshara. There has to be a hidden route somewhere through Felwood.<br>
Unknown_Male: Most smugglers will not want the attention of the high overlord, but I do know of somebody who is more loyal to the horde than their profits.<br>
Unknown_Female: Then it is decided. Saurfang, Nathanos - you are to leave at once.<br>
Unknown_Female: $n, let&apos;s keep the remainder of Malfurion&apos;s army busy.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Male: Armory construction complete. What are your orders?<br>
Unknown_Male: Get those forges up and running! And don&apos;t stop feeding them until this war is won.<br>
Unknown_Female: Bestiary ready, warbringer.<br>
Unknown_Male: Good, good. I hope our pups are hungry. Prepare the wolfriders for battle!<br>
Unknown_Female: Da spirit lodge is ready for ya. Whatcha needin&apos;?<br>
Unknown_Male: Ready the shaman for battle. It&apos;s time we turn the tide in our favor.<br>
<br>
Unknown_Female: Workshop ready for action!<br>
Unknown_Male: The demolishers outta that workshop gonna make quick work of those Alliance walls!<br>
Unknown_Male: Armory construction complete. What are your orders?<br>
Unknown_Male: Time to start outfittin&apos; our troops with better armor!<br>
Unknown_Female: Bestiary ready, warbringer.<br>
Unknown_Male: Excellent. Our wolfriders gonna tear you to pieces!<br>
Unknown_Female: Da spirit lodge is ready for ya. Whatcha needin&apos;?<br>
Unknown_Male: Ready de shaman for battle.</div></div>
