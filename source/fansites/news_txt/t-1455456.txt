Battle.Net Website Update - Warlords of Draenor Preorder Preparation
Blizzard made a small update to the Battle.Net website on Friday to add design elements for the Warlords of Draenor preorder and Digital Deluxe edition upgrade. No preorder date has been announced yet. The level 90 boost feature is part of Patch 5.4.7, and the latest PTR Build is flagged as a Release Candidate.

My upward 50-100K dmg differential on an attempt to attempt basis as Ele begs to differ...
If you meant 50k-100k DPS, I'm very dubious of that being due to RNG. If you meant 50k-100k damage, that's negligible. Celestalon 
 Logs to back it up. Look at both malk attempts. Almost same length, 40k+ difference. Not first time.
You died on the parse you did 10% less DPS, and spent significantly less time casting. That 40k difference is not all RNG. Celestalon 
Your recent comments like this one about rng make me feel like devs don't raid competitively or heroics at all
I've killed every single 25H raid boss when it was progression, since AQ40. From BC to Garrosh. We raid. Celestalon 
The true question is : do you arena ? 
I dabble in it. I've gotten to 2200 once before, I think only like 1700ish the last few seasons; don't recall exactly. Celestalon 
I'm much more of a PvE focused player myself, but we have other team members who are equally focused on PvP. Team effort. Celestalon 

I think making more abilities talents that you can choose: active vs passive. Would be a good way to keep/trim at same time.
Yeah, an interesting point. How would everyone feel if that ability we wanted to cut but you want to keep became a talent? Celestalon 
Abilities you'd want to cut are NOT worthy of being talents unless you put them on a non role increase row.
Of course, we wouldn't put a utility spell on the same row as throughput talents. Celestalon 
We're keeping in mind that cutting abilities people don't have keybound anyway doesn't buy us as much. Far Sight, Mind Vision, etc. Celestalon 
Not promising that any ability you don't have keybound is safe, but it's less likely. Celestalon 

what happens to the current talents we love? Or the blizzcon ideas...
We may also cut some existing talents that aren't working; could replace them with these abilities. Celestalon 

I'm afraid you'll cut too many and turn this game into GW2 or another 8 button action bar game which I can't stand.
We're keeping feedback like this in mind, very much. The goal will be to remove unneeded buttons, not dumb down the game. Celestalon 
I'm afraid you won't cut enough buttons. 
I'm certain that some people will say we cut too much, some will say we cut too little. Very difficult to balance. Celestalon 
Or, we cut to little, but what we did cut we shouldn't have. Celestalon 

Art
Which race for the model update is proving to be the most artistically or technically challenging to implement?
currently the Orc female is giving us a hard time - never realized how much her mouth looks like Homer Simpson's mouth. artofcgrobinson 
Hm wasn't that the orc female in the trailer? Or you mean in general with customization?
trailer version was an earlier take of the model, wasn't completely happy so iterating more on the face/body texture artofcgrobinson 

PvE
I could really use one right now, undermanning SoO. Need alcohol to deal with all these 1-tank strategies haha
Craziest one I heard of was 1-tanking Spoils. /boggleReminds me of 1-tanking H-LK. What a rush! Celestalon 
I've 1-healed Spoils before, that was fun actually. I'm not sure I understand 1-tanking! How does it work /headtilt
They all do one quarter, then swap sides, do both quarters, then swap sides, do last quarter. Lotsa teleports back up top. Celestalon 

PvP
how about you try better. Give us blue collar guys a Friday treat. New season ilvl perhaps..?
550, happy friday! holinka 
How about new ceiling?
It will steadily increase over the course of the season to 540. holinka 
Are you implying that 6.0 will come 28 weeks after season 15 starts? Or doesn't the 1 item level/week rule apply?
Yeah, not implying anything of the sort. It will reach 540 at a point when we think many people have 550 gear. holinka 

How are you going to avoid damage being way too high in the next season when people will have 550 ilvl ?
We've increased resilience. We can increase it again if necessary. holinka 

Any word on how crafters will obtain the patterns for the next line of crafted PvP gear next session?
There will not be a set of crafted PvP gear for the new season. holinka 

when will we get to see the new armor for S15 arena?? Wanna see how good the priest will look??
Season 15 armor is a color shift of Season 14 armor. Unfortunately, we weren't able to create new models for the season. holinka 
PVP S15 Conq Gear, so the gear will look like the opposing factions Grievous in game now? Ex: Ally get red?
Yes holinka 

is the elite gear for season 15 still going to be the same color?
Unfortunately yes. holinka 

Will we get a new pvp mount for S15?
Unfortunately, no. holinka 

s15 pvp dropped from celestial? what about a new content pve with this season??? raid tier etc
Dropping another tier of PvP gear is a trivial time investment for us, compared to a whole new raid tier. Focusing on WoD. Celestalon
