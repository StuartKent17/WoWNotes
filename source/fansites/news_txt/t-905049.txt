Boubouille2011-05-15, 11:38 AMEncounter Journal Preview
The Encounter Journal is finally on the test realms and even if it isn't finished we finally know how much information we will get from it: a lot. The Firelands raid encounters are already there and it looks like Blizzard really wants you to know where you're going before you enter a raid, see the screenshots below. 

I also added a small video preview from OMFGCata  because every time I forget to post a video from Jesse, a puppy gets sad.

If you're still wondering how much info you can get for a single fight, check the preview of the Ragnaros encounter below. Everything in the preview except for the picture, I guess is from the Encounter Journal and not a single bit of it is from extra datamining. 


Ragnaros - Encounter Journal Preview Heroic Version
Ragnaros, lord of the Firelands, embodies the fury and destruction of the promordial infernos that forged Azeroth itself. Promised the chance to set Azeroth aflame without interference from Neptulon and Therazane, Ragnaros seeks to appease the Old Gods by incinerating the World Tree of Nordrassil.

He has legs now. Who knew?
