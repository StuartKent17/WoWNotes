Garrison Lumber<br>
We&apos;re watching the spawns and experiences people are having. It&apos;s an easy enough number to tune. The question is: Are you just hanging around one zone or are you moving around? What tier is your LM? At level 1 it&apos;s going to be more difficult to fill your work orders since you can only log small timber. Also, timber spawns are much more plentiful in Spires/Nagrand.<br>
<br>
Good feedback. Few notes:<br>
<br>
Lumber Mill level 2 (and all medium plot blueprints for that matter) unlock at level 98 on the blueprint vendor. You can also get a token for a medium building by completing the Spires of Arak building quest chain.<br>
Small timber exists in every zone (except Frostfire). Spires is probably the most densely spawned with small timber, with Talador a close second.<br>
You can currently use timber to buy a few more things and we&apos;ll try to add more. At the very least if you ever manage to get Phylarch you&apos;ll likely want a steady supply on hand for Everbloom Seeds.<br>
<br>
That said, we&apos;ll take a look at the spawn points. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/329835-sooo-about-the-lumber/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13682248279?page=1#8))<br>

Next Beta Build<br>
We weren&apos;t able to get a new full build deployed this week (aside from the minor fastpatch we did on Wednesday to fix some Garrison issues), but we&apos;re hoping to get a beta build out to you all early next week.<br>
<br>
Thanks for being patient, and thanks for testing! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/329757-will-we-see-a-new-beta-build-today/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13680208005?page=1#18))<br>

Blood Elf Model Delay<br>
yes but it was expected to be more than one race. Not having half done for the release actually feels better to me than leaving out one.<br>
Yeah I understand that, feeling like the odd one out. But just think about that patch when you do get your updated model. Everyone else&apos;s models will be common by then, everyone will have been seeing them every day. But when the new Blood Elf model goes in it&apos;s going to be a new thing, and everyone will be focused on you and how fancy you look.<br>
<br>
Sounds like the kind of &apos;fashionably late&apos; style a Blood Elf would appreciate. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/329715-no-blood-elf-models-in-wod-launch/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13681698157?page=2#35))<br>

Warlords of Draenor Theorycraft Discussion<br>
On beta, haste is not affecting Healing Stream Totem nor Healing Tide Totem tics. Is that intended?<br>
Rejoice, for we have rebuilt Healing Stream Totem and Healing Tide Totem. They now will function 100% like any other periodic effect. No more fuzzy haste breakpoints due to server laziness of despawning totems. You even get partial ticks of them due to haste.<br>
<br>
Check it out in the next beta build. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/318876-warlords-of-draenor-theorycraft-discussion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13087818929?page=27#540))<br>

Classes<br>
this is the same for most hybrids, 1 gcd vs scores to throw out rejuvs, healing touches<br>
We absolutely do not balance utility by expecting anyone to switch to primarily healing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492889072969318401))<br>
The fact that a Boomkin could stop DPSing and throw Rejuvs on the raid does not factor into it at all. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492889188870520832))<br>
The fact that they could keep DPSing and let Ysera&apos;s Gift or Nature&apos;s Vigil do a ton of healing *does* though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492889322199068672))<br>
Sorry if I ever gave the impression that we are counting &quot;stop DPSing and Flash of Light&quot; as raid utility. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492889572116684800))<br>
Dream of Cenarius, Heart of the Wild? If NV healing is = increased healing from amp magic, that&apos;s nice.<br>
Heart of the Wild is a separate beast of its own. It&apos;s an option to provide *WAY* more utility, at a DPS loss. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492892166104965120))<br>
The availability of HotW is not what Druid utility is based around. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492892259382091778))<br>

In the simplest possible terms, using other abilities other than Frost Strike is punitive and inefficient.<br>
Not if it doesn&apos;t cause you to lose Frost Strikes... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492891887133405185))<br>
Except it does, runic power becomes runes, runes become RP, it is all connected, inefficient in 1 area affects all<br>
The conversion from RP to Dmg/Runes is better for Frost than the others. But so what? They&apos;re balanced around it (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492893135081467905))<br>
It&apos;s a leaky bucket. As long as it never overflows, it doesn&apos;t matter whether you pull RP or Runes out first. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492893728080547840))<br>
<br>
What would your response be to nixing 2H out of Frost entirely? Would save yourself from further headaches.<br>
Response would be &quot;No.&quot; (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/493840921121660929))<br>
May I ask why? I am honestly trying to figure out the need for both, no trolling.<br>
Because that&apos;s the defined style of the spec. Changing that now would be gigantic. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/493841829712773120))<br>

This makes 2 niche talents for Feral at level 100. Are you that confident that the majority of Ferals will be happy with LI?<br>
I don&apos;t understand. Shirvallah is the opposite of a niche talent. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/493097249753141248))<br>

Why not just make the Divine Storm free of cost? That way it&apos;s less clunky and people who want DS happy?<br>
That&apos;d make it used for single target. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492882662114070529))<br>
<br>
I&apos;m curious is there any reason why DS shouldn&apos;t be allowed single target? I mean both DK&apos;s and Warriors AoE single target.<br>
It&apos;s not that it&apos;s AoE so much as it&apos;s added complication. That talent is intended to be the one with minimal gameplay impact. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492898418088366081))<br>
However, I&apos;m not quite sure how the Divine Storm proc from Final Verdict being free would add much more complication.<br>
It adds an additional button to your single target rotation. That&apos;s pretty objectively added complication. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492901262413676544))<br>
True, but would it not be more confusing to people to see they have a Divine Storm proc that they *Shouldn&apos;t* use single target?<br>
A fair question. It&apos;s something we&apos;re weighing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492901942180335616))<br>
<br>
So for AoE you want to weave in Final Verdicts everytime you want to Divine Storm? Or is the proc worth it ST?<br>
Proc will not make it worth it, single target. But it will make it so you want to alternate them for AoE. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492877379933442048))<br>
wait...if it&apos;s a 100% buff, isn&apos;t it a complete wash compared to just using DS exclusively?<br>
Except you can do it ahead of time, and you also got the FV damage too. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883185584197634))<br>
<br>
So, Rets had too much raid utility...if that were true they&apos;d be guaranteed spots in raid/wanted a lot more.<br>
No, damage throughput has a lot to do with that too. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883024099303424))<br>
<br>
Don&apos;t know how I feel about this...I would like to ask you why remove raid utility from a hybrid but give to a pure dps?<br>
Because pure vs hybrid isn&apos;t relevant to this. The goal is parity for all. Anyone we removed it from had too much. Some had none. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492881299904794625))<br>
Do you value all utility as equal or is there more to it?<br>
The value of utility is very hard to balance; commonly totally subjective. Tough calls to make, but we try. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492882785703428096))<br>
You are taking away from a class that sees little play and giving to a class that was already well off.<br>
There are no &apos;giving from one to the other&apos; things here. And many other changes are involved. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883486185771010))<br>
Remember, the goal is *balance*. Equality. That should be what you want. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883551633694723))<br>
Devo Aura was the only reason Rets were used in MoP. We will be in less raids now.<br>
You lost Devo... Others lost a ton too. Overall raid cooldown utility went way down. Again: *balance*. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492884799825010689))<br>
<br>
... I understand if offheals are far stronger than live/healers weaker but ret flash of light vs smoke bomb?<br>
Ret utility is easy to overlook because it&apos;s not as blatant as Smoke Bomb. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883757087485952))<br>
There is, however, a ton of it. Many are situational, but some subsection is always useful. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883980530626561))<br>
Hand of Sacrifice. Hand of Protection. Hand of Purity. Double all those Hands. Sacred Shield. Lay on Hands. ...(cont) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492884180120768513))<br>
Lay on Hands. Level 90 talents&apos; offhealing. Hand of Freedom. Divine Shield. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492884508387975169))<br>
So how do you balance this? Do we do more damage than rogues seeing as we trade massive dmg for our utility compared?<br>
What? How do you trade &quot;massive damage&quot; for your utility? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492887367246561280))<br>
Considering you count exec sentence as part of our utility, which is a pretty large dmg loss to use that way.<br>
I was mostly referring to Light&apos;s Hammer (or Holy Prism, if we tune that better). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492888629417488384))<br>
That&apos;s still a single target dmg loss to take those...(I assume you wouldn&apos;t tune them better single target)<br>
But most fights are not single target. Light&apos;s Hammer is the top simcraft DPS talent on many fights, anyway. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492889879781466112))<br>

Even Gladiator Warriors dislike Bonus Armor despite being touted as &quot;Best DPS Stat for Gladiator&quot; By Celestalon himself.<br>

She is referring to Rukhmar and Sethe. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493190365168820224))<br>
Are Rukhmar and Anzu children of the Raven Mother?<br>
No, the Raven Mother is Anzu&apos;s consort - a demigod he left in charge of the ravens. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493190697064103937))<br>
<br>
So Terokk and Anzu were definitely presented as evil in tBC. Now they&apos;re painted in a much more positive light. So, what happened? Did they turn evil in those 30 years? Or are we missing something?<br>
Sorry if it&apos;s not totally clear! It&apos;s a story-heavy zone, and we are missing a few events to help explain things. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493455041676578816))<br>
They are both grappling with the curse and on the downward spiral. In BC Anzu is called back by the Sethekk. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493453953753817088))<br>
Terokk was pretty dark in his final days. Ultimately it&apos;s the player who sways the arakkoa away from evil in the WoD timeline. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493454385301553153))<br>

You CAN&apos;T make it important to the world. It&apos;s a second, public garrison. All it does is make YOUR garrison feel LESS important.<br>

Karabor will have vendors, and you can go there and do w/e you want, it&apos;s not going anywhere. Not sure why the anger on this. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/493170147830419456))<br>
I just think players are tired of the Orcs and Humans thing. It&apos;d be really cool to see Kara/BSF actually being used by players.<br>
TBH If I had infinite time, I&apos;d rather do a shared hub in Auchindoun or somewhere new/cool that has that Shatt/Dal vibe. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/493206198544789504))<br>
