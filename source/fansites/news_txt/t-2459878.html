Shaman community perception vs. reality<br>
I don&#x2019;t mean to harp on you not specifically mentioning enhance. But I am constantly getting told enhance doesn&#x2019;t bring enough cleave to be invited to a group. Note, not a mention of my skill, but of the class itself. I am pretty good at enhance, i am pretty bad at ele. But my god can ele do some amazing cleave and aoe dmg. Enhance&#x2026; um&#x2026; no? I get that there is and should be differences, but the gap seems too wide, no?<br>
<br>
Right now that&#x2019;s an issue with the perception of Shamans. numbers wise shamans can put them up, both Elemental and Enhancement, however the perception of Shamans in 8.0 has led to you guys into having a harder time when in reality you&#x2019;re perfectly viable. I wish I had a solution to this right now but its something we&#x2019;re aware of and know it becomes a problem if a class is known as &#x201C;struggling&#x201D;. One of those unfortunate WoW things when it comes to community discussion on viability that has existed since Vanilla.<br>
<br>
Little off topic from OPs original post but just letting you know its something we&#x2019;re aware of.<br>
