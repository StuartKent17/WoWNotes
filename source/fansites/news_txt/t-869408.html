Patch 4.1/4.2 - Winged Lion Mount?<br>
I spent a couple of days debating if I should post this model or not since it seems to be an early beta of the model and I&apos;ll assume that at this point my readers are smart enough to understand that the things they see can be a work in progress, so there you go! <br>
<br>
One of the latest beta build of Patch 4.1 on PTRs added a new mount model, the Winged Lion Mount! We don&apos;t have any information on this mount for the moment, and as I said it looks like a very early version of the model but ... IT&apos;S A LION WITH WINGS! <br>

Patch 4.1 PTR Notes Update - March 15<br>
The Patch 4.1 PTR Notes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/160430/patch-41-public-test-realm-notes-march-15) have been updated once again with a couple of class changes and more raiding nerfs. <br>
Classes: General<br>
<br>
Several persistent ground effects now display different visuals for hostile and friendly players. The following spells have the same visual effects for friendly players, but new alternate visuals for hostile players: Ring of Frost, Consecration, Desecration, Wild Mushroom, Flare, Ice Trap, Power Word: Barrier, Smoke Bomb, and Hand of Gul&apos;dan. As a general rule, the alternate effects have a red tint or hue indicating they are created by an enemy player.<br>

Restoration<br>
<br>
Efflorescence has been redesigned. It creates a healing zone at the feet of a Swiftmend target, but this healing zone now restores health equal to 4/8/12% of the amount healed by Swiftmend to the three most injured targets within 8 yards, every 1 second for 7 seconds. This periodic effect now also benefits from spell haste, but the individual ticks cannot be critical effects. In addition, Living Seed is no longer a prerequisite talent for Efflorescence.<br>

Botting in WoW<br>
This comment by Bashiok follows a giant banwave of people botting Archaeology and PvP earlier this week. That&apos;s why you shouldn&apos;t cheat if you want to keep your WoW account and that&apos;s why pointing to any exploit or cheat on our forums will get you banned, hard. <br>
We&#x2019;re in the process of stepping up our detection and tracking to log and action players that are botting, or habitually AFKing in the Battlegrounds. We&#x2019;ll be taking aggressive action and removing earned items, Honor Points, and ultimately suspending or even banning accounts of those that are found to be botting or habitually AFKing. It&#x2019;s a sophisticated level of monitoring we&#x2019;re undertaking. No one actively playing in the Battlegrounds normally should be concerned that they&#x2019;ll be actioned. <br>

Heroic Leap<br>
Perhaps I should elaborate further. Heroic Leap should work on flat surfaces, and in a great many places, actually. We&apos;ve had players telling us that it fails constantly, but without providing more specific information regarding where and how; hence the requests for more reports. There are very specific situations where we have purposefully stopped it from functioning to help prevent exploitation, which I&apos;ve covered in more detail below.<br>
<br>
Plus it causes tons of exploit issues, due to the elevation of the leap.<br>
Exploitation was indeed a concern, and some of the Heroic Leap failures you&#x2019;ve seen might be because of the restrictions we put in place to prevent exploitation. If you&#x2019;re in an area where flying is restricted (like a Battleground) and your leap would cause you to gain more than about 4 yards of altitude, then the spell should fail -- though the cooldown shouldn&#x2019;t be wasted. It should otherwise generally work on flat terrain and succeed much more often outdoors.<br>
<br>
It wasn&#x2019;t an ideal solution, but we added this limitation because players were able to use the targeted jump to exploit terrain to reach inaccessible areas or even leave the map. This wasn&#x2019;t a knee-jerk reaction either; we received literally hundreds of documented cases where warriors could exploit the ability. The short term alternatives, such as disabling it in Battlegrounds completely, felt worse. Ultimately, we want to remove the height restriction in Battlegrounds and other restricted areas when we have a more robust technical solution.
