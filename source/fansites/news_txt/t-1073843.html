The final version of the official patch notes includes a few extra changes to the game, including a nerf to the heroic version of Spine of Deathwing.<br>
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br>
Dragon Soul<br>
<br>
Yor&#x2019;sahj the Unsleeping<br>
<br>
The Shaman spell Unleash Life now properly only triggers Deep Corruption on its target. Previously, this affected both the caster and the target.<br>
<br>
Spine of Deathwing<br>
<br>
Burning Tendons health has been reduced by 15% in 10- and 25-player Heroic mode. This change eases the burst damage requirement to complete the encounter, which should allow players to make use of more varied raid compositions.<br>
<br>
Madness of Deathwing<br>
<br>
The Priest spell Leap of Faith is no longer usable while under the effect of Carrying Winds.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Maw of the Dragonlord can now have its effect triggered by healing from Holy Word: Sanctuary.<br>
<br>
<br>
User Interface<br>
<br>
Fixed a bug that caused the Mature Language Filter to reset on exit.<br>
A notice is now displayed 15 minutes prior to the player being disconnected by parental controls.<br>
<br>

Patch 4.3.2 Going Live This Week<br>
The information isn&apos;t official but assuming everything goes as planned, Patch 4.3.2 should be going live this week. It&apos;s not like it can go wrong 2 weeks in a row, right? <br>
<br>
<br>
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/january/patchtime_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/january/patchtime.jpg)<br>
<br>
This patch is bringing us Cross Realm raids for older content with RealID friends, a few item tweaks and new items, a few new achievements, and a reduced game client install size. It&apos;s also bringing the 64 bit client to the game, even if it won&apos;t be directly included in the game client it will be available as a separate download after the release of the patch. <br>
<br>
And yes, there&apos;s technically a 0.5% chance that something can go wrong. Just like last week the patch is scheduled for deployment internally, the patch files are already available on Blizzard&apos;s patch servers, and everything points to a release this week. It doesn&apos;t mean that things can&apos;t go wrong like last week, and this is exactly why Blizzard doesn&apos;t announce patches early and this is exactly why I looked like a big-ass idiot (http://xkcd.com/37/) last tuesday. <br>
<br>
Cross Realm Raids<br>
We previously introduced the ability to form cross-realm parties with Real ID friends (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/190952-new-real-id-party-feature-now-live/), and now with Patch 4.3.2, we&apos;re adding the ability for players to use that same functionality to form raids to run older normal or heroic raids, or participate in Battlegrounds!<br>
<br>
This will allow you to join up with your Real ID friends (http://us.battle.net/en/realid/) from other realms and:<br>
<br>
Form a cross-realm raid and use Raid Finder<br>
Jump in to any classic dungeon or raid and be automatically placed in the same instance<br>
Join forces and dominate the Battlegrounds<br>
<br>
<br>
Please note, you will not yet be able to run normal or Heroic Dragon Soul with cross-realm Real ID raids.<br>
<br>
As we look forward to the BattleTag system (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/209494-introducing-battletag/), it&#x2019;s a very exciting time for World of Warcraft. No matter what realm you and your friends are on you&#x2019;ll be able to team up and take on group content throughout the game.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dragon Soul Difficulty Changes<br>
During the scheduled server maintenance on the week of January 31, the Dragon Soul raid will become enveloped by the &#x201C;Power of the Aspects&#x201D; spell, reducing the health and damage dealt of all enemies in the raid by 5%. This spell will grow progressively stronger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/109257/power-of-the-aspects/) over time to reduce the difficulty and make the encounters more accessible. The spell will affect both normal and Heroic difficulties, but it will not affect the Looking for Raid difficulty.<br>
<br>
The spell can also be disabled by talking to Lord Afrasastrasz at the beginning of Dragon Soul, if a raid wishes to attempt the encounters without the aid of the Dragon Aspects.<br>
<br>
For those of you who raided in Firelands and/or Icecrown you&#x2019;re no doubt aware that as time goes on we want to keep people progressing by adjusting the difficulty. For any number of reasons a group may be having difficulty on a specific encounter each week, and our intent in adjusting the content is to ensure the ability to keep progressing, enjoying the content, and gearing up. With Icecrown we progressively buffed the players, and while this slow progression (and ability to opt-out of the buff) were both beneficial, it led to an expectation of your characters power, and once you left the raid you could certainly feel less effective. For Firelands we attempted to fix that by nerfing the content instead of buffing players, but we nerfed the content difficulty all at one time, which was counterproductive for players who really didn&#x2019;t need as severe a change as we made. With Dragon Soul we&#x2019;re attempting to do the best of both by having a progressive nerf to the content, keeping player power constant while providing small increases in assistance over a long period of time, as well as allowing players to opt-out of the assistance by speaking to Lord Afrasastrasz.<br>
<br>
We hope you continue to enjoy Dragon Soul, and that these changes encourage you to attempt a higher difficulty, or just keep pushing to down that next boss.<br>
<br>
<br>
4.3.2 PTR and New File Optimization Tech<br>
With the 4.3.2 patch we&#x2019;ll be testing some new file optimization tech. As you may be aware, with previous major expansion patches (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, etc.) we&#x2019;ve carried out a time-consuming process to reorganize the game files currently installed on your hard drive to integrate all previous patch files, essentially &#x2018;cleaning up&#x2019; what&#x2019;s on your computer and reducing the full installation size. This process used to require an amount of free hard drive space double that of the entire installation size to complete, which is why we&#x2019;ve reserved them for large expansion-sized patches.<br>
<br>
The new tech we&#x2019;re testing with the 4.3.2 PTR will process these cleanups with no additional hard drive space required beyond what the patch is adding. Because of that you may see them appear more frequently with patches.<br>
<br>
While the cleanup is occurring you&#x2019;ll see a specific message on the launcher informing you the process is currently taking place. If you encounter any issues with the new process please be sure to visit our support site at http://www.battle.net/support/<br>

Items<br>
<br>
Vial of Shadows (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/77207/vial-of-shadows/) had the proc damage cut in third and proc frequency tripled to reduce burst in PvP.<br>
Many of the original level 60 ranked PvP gear items have had Replica added to the start of their name, making their name identical to the versions being sold in Area 52, for example the Replica High Warlord&apos;s Cleaver (http://db.mmo-champion.com/item/77580/#15050/15148). However, they still retain their higher item level and stats.<br>
Gurthalak, Voice of the Deeps (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/78487/gurthalak-voice-of-the-deeps/) had its proc time increased to 12 seconds from 10 seconds. This change was made to all three versions of the item.<br>
The three new items added in Patch 4.3.2 are found on the TCG Loot vendor in Booty Bay. They are part of the Timewalkers: War of the Ancients expansion. (Feldrake (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79771/feldrake/), Eye of the Legion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79744/eye-of-the-legion/), and Demon Hunter&apos;s Aspect (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79769/demon-hunters-aspect/))<br>
