Mana regeneration "too good" in beta
Nobody seems to be having problems with mana in Naxx right now maybe Ret pallies, but I think that's because regen is too good across the board. I wouldn't use that experience yet to determine that you have enough Spirit. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/9679908318-tons-of-spirit-on-the-naxx-balance-gear.html

Lack of crit on Nax 10 Gear
Most casters are going to have a lot of Spirit on their gear, but we'll see if we can get you some more crit. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/9679908318-tons-of-spirit-on-the-naxx-balance-gear.html

Mana regeneration as a mage
I hear your concerns about Spirit and the Moonkin ones too and it's something we are discussing. We don't really expect a mage to stand around waiting for FSR to kick in often. I was trying to stress that casters were sort of allowed to opt out of worrying about mana in order to just do more damage throughout a lot of BC. But managing mana is supposed to be a part of playing the class well. You have some mana related tools already, and we will discuss talents that benefit Spirit or else trying to strip some off the gear. 

Fire Tree Feedback
Please use this thread to consolidate any feedback you have on the Fire tree. Which talents do you like? Which ones are disappointing? Which would be fine with a numbers tweak? Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=9679911937&sid=2000

Frost Tree Feedback
Please use this thread of course to post any feedback on your own Frost tree. Comments on which talents are fun, which ones are confusing and which ones you'd never get are all welcome. It's fine to mention talents in other trees that you like to cross-spec into, but try to keep to the topic of the thread, because these get a lot of posts.

Arcane Tree Feedback
This forum is dedicated to any concerns, issues or feedback you have on the Arcane talents. Please try to keep other topics, damage comparisons to other classes perhaps, in other threads. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=9679911930&sid=2000

Metamorphosis Feedback
While this is not final and could absolutely change, here is what we're thinking about for the new design:
You keep your pet.
You keep your spells.
It buffs spell damage for that "blow your cooldowns" feel.
It buffs mitigation you could even tank for a bit.
It provides the current snare reduction for PvP.
You'll still get a few fun demon abilities, but you can just use your normal spells if you'd rather. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/9679890957-metamorphosis-feedback.html
