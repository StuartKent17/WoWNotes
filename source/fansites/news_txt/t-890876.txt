Boubouille2011-04-22, 04:23 AMPatch 4.1: Guild Finder
In patch 4.1 we'll be introducing the Guild Finder, a new system designed to enable easier and faster guild recruitment. Guild leaders and players who are looking for a guild to call home will use the Guild Finder to meet one another and begin communications that can lead to a prosperous membership.

The Guild Finder is intended to act as an in-game bulletin board for guilds that are actively recruiting. Previously in World of Warcraft, your options were limited. You would have to publicly post on your realm forum message board, or speak to other players directly via private messages or the chat channels. That can be a time consuming process. Guild Finder will allow your “looking for new members” message to work 24 hours a day, accessible to all of the characters in your faction, from anywhere in the game.

A new Guild Finder button will now appear on your Micro Menu if you're either a guild leader or currently unguilded.

As a guild leader, you will indicate one or more of the common guild interests such as PvP, Raids, or Role Playing, a general time of the week availability you’re looking for Weekdays or Weekends, and which class roles you seek from new members Tank, Healer, Damage. The Comment field is where you can say anything you like about your guild and/or the sort of members you seek. Do you only accept female orcs? Is your guild slowly transitioning from 10-person to 25-person raiding? Perhaps you’ll only accept new members who are available to play on Thursdays at noon? This is the place to say so, and help potential recruits determine whether your guild is what they’re looking for.

From the perspective of an unguilded player, the Guild Finder allows you to browse through a list of the guilds currently looking for new members. Just launch the Guild Finder, tell it about your availability, class role, and the sorts of guild activities you’re looking for, and then click “Browse Guilds.” This will take you to the second tab, where you’ll see a list of recruiting guilds that fit your profile. Here you can read about them, and if you like what you see, submit a request to join.

Requests submitted to recruiting guilds appear in the Requests tab. From this third tab, guild leaders can examine potential recruits and proceed with the final steps toward new membership.

Whether you’re a guild leader looking to fill your ranks or a player looking for a guild that meets your strictest requirements, the Guild Finder provides an easy way to make new friends!

Heroic Nefarian down? Want to work for Blizzard?
You have Heroic Nefarian on farm, Cho'gall is a two-headed joke, Al'Akir is a bag of hot wind, and you have detailed documents on how all of these encounters could have been improved. If you're looking for the next great challenge, have you ever though about working for Blizzard?

We have Quality Assurance QA positions open and we're specifically looking for those with high-end raiding experience to join our teams, test future content, and provide feedback on Heroic raids, class balance, and general game experiences.

http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/posting.html?id=100008C

Only full-time positions at our headquarters in Irvine, California are available, so if you're serious about applying be aware that no telecommuting is possible for employment. But with the Blizzard campus offering an on-site cafeteria, library, volleyball and basketball courts, gym, multiple arcades, and movie theater, not to mention we're 30 minutes from the beach why would you want to?

Good luck!
