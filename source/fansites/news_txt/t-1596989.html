Clarification: http://t.co/xTKddHt4dr Does the 5% strength for Fallen Crusader apply to Frost only? Or both Unholy and Frost?<br>
That&apos;s a Frost perk. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/512436625033289730))<br>

Storm Elemental abilities now do 15% &amp; 30% rather than 215% &amp; 428%. Possible change to inherited SP for elemental pets?<br>

You&apos;ll likely see many more variants of things used when the transmog revamp happens (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/512344229570281472))<br>
As in it&apos;ll be part of the system to acquire alternative skins, or a whole bunch of pieces are being put in? TY 4 response btw<br>
Not decided yet, we&apos;ll have more info eventually (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/512347117902245888))<br>

The cloak/metagem/etc. vendor will remain accessible to those who have unlocked those items via quests (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/512289913174102016))<br>
<br>
Achievements<br>
Any news on this?<br>
The Sinestra FoS has been unattainable since Mists. Same deal for the Ra-den one once Draenor unlocks. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/512282864637849600))<br>

Garrisons<br>
if you build the &quot;Enchanting&quot; building in your garrision do you get the ability to disenchant or do you still need an alt? <br>
You get a disenchanting font for disenchanting all of the things! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/512348062459514880))<br>
<br>
So I&apos;m exalted wit the Exodar, and I have a Level 3 Barracks for Draenei guards. What happens if I change out the Barracks?<br>
You keep your guards, but need to make your &apos;rax again if you want to change them again. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/512351414173978624))</div></div>
