<img src="" title="Important" /> Fluidity  - All players standing in Conductive Water receive Fluidity, granting 40% increased healing and inflict 40% increased damage. However, all players standing in Conductive Water also take 100% increased Nature damage.

Conduction - Many of Jin'rokh the Breaker's abilities travel through Conductive Water, inflicting Nature damage to all players in that Conductive Water.
Electrified Waters  - Jin'rokh the Breaker infuses the Conductive Water with storm energies, removing Fluidity and inflicting 45,500 Nature damage every second to all players remaining in the Conductive Water. All players standing in Conductive Water still take 100% increased Nature damage.

<img src="" title="Tank" /> Static Wound  - Jin'rokh the Breaker statically constricts the target, inflicting 19,500 Nature damage per stack to all players when taking melee attacks. This effect stacks, but reduces in potency over time.

<img src="" title="Important" /> Focused Lightning  - Jin'rokh the Breaker creates an orb of Focused Lightning, which fixates on a player. The Focused Lightning detonates upon reaching that player, inflicting 195,000 Nature damage to all players within 8 yards. This orb also pulses 52,000 Nature damage every half second to other players within 5 yards.

Conduction - Focused Lightning Detonation damage travels through Conductive Water, inflicting 195,000 Nature damage to players standing in Conductive Water.

<img src="" title="Tank" /> Thundering Throw  - Jin'rokh the Breaker throws his current target at a distant Mogu statue, breaking the statue and inflicting 206,250 Physical damage. Additionally inflicts 260,000 Nature damage to other players within 14 yards of the point of impact, stunning them for 9 sec. Conductive Water erupts from the broken statue, forming a pool on the ground.
Lightning Storm  - Jin'rokh the Breaker commands a fierce Lightning Storm, inflicting 91,000 Nature damage to all players every second for 15 sec. Furthermore, the Lightning Storm electrifies Conductive Water.

Lightning Strike  - Lightning Strikes multiple locations throughout the room during Lightning Storm, inflicting 250,000 Nature damage to nearby players. Each Lightning Strike diffuses, inflicting 150,000 Nature damage to all players in a line.

<img src="" title="Heroic" /> <img src="" title="Magic" /> Ionization  - Jin'rokh the Breaker ionizes enemy players, attracting storm energies over 24 sec. Inflicts 500,000 Nature damage to players within 8 yards when dispelled or duration expires.

Patch 5.2 - Ra-den Audio
Ra-den is the Heroic difficulty only boss found in the Throne of Thunder raid. There is still nothing about him in the Dungeon Journal, other than the little bit of lore.


<object width="853" height="480"><param name="movie" value=";hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src=";hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="853" height="480" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

Shrouded in Mystery - There are no scholars with any recollection or record regarding the details of Ra-den's powers. Perhaps these memories have been obscured by the passage of time, or perhaps none who saw the Keeper of Storms in battle ever lived to speak of what they witnessed....

Lei Shen's life changed forever when he stumbled into a dark chamber below what are now the Mogu'shan Vaults. Legend has it he found an ancient titan keeper guarding a miraculous device known as the Engine of Nalak'sha. No one knows what transpired between the two beings, but Lei Shen later emerged from the site bristling with the power to forge an empire. The keeper's fate -- and his current whereabouts -- remain a mystery.

Classes
You succeeded at Active mitigation - avoidance is by definition passive mitigation - regretting the change?
Nope. We think active mitigation is more fun. Just need to decide what to do about dodge and parry long term. Source 

Items with spirit on it. Holy vs disc vs shadow - which spec gets priority in your opinion? Causing gearing issues ATM.
IMO it doesn't matter that much. Too many healers think they must have Spirit in every single slot and they really don't. Source 
That said, we think the whole Spirit to hit thing is awkward and we'd like to come up with a better solution in a future expansion. Source 

Long term, are "pure" dps classes here to stay, or are you guys evaluating other options?
We talk about it often. I'm not sure all those pures would want to be hybrids though. Not as simple as oh just ignore that role. Source 
For the pures that want, it's a plus. For the pures that don't, they can deal with it just like all other classes
Maybe they picked pure so they wouldn't have to deal with it. Source 

Tanks are still number 1 DPS for like all fights. It's a bit frustraiting as a DPS to not be able to compete. Concerns?
Can you name a specific fight? Dungeon? Raid? Happens on Mel'jarak because of the fight. Not common elsewhere. Source 

you are going to have to listen to the people playing the class and not all the ones playing everything else.
But the people playing the class are the most likely to think excessive buffs are reasonable. The others have a different pov. Source 
the others have the pov that no nerf is ever enough.
That can happen. It's really hard to have the objectivity to recognize the difference between overpowered and outplayed. Source 

Anyway you can balance out all the class specs so that there are no more FOTM specs? No best DPS spec, no best Healing, etc.
We try. There's math and then there are player reactions and we try to balance the two. Source 

So pls stop making drastic changes to mage pve spec,tired of having to regem/spec/test/learn a new rotation every month. 
The alternative is all the players who love X spec just can't play it. Not sure how to solve both. Source 

Theorycrafting ruined the game, it made everyone elitist and most specs "nonviable" because they do 5% less DPS.
No objections to theorycrafting overall. It's when stack ranks of DPS are offered as fact that it causes more harm than good. Source 

So you're more concerned with representation than balance?
There is often a relationship. Balance is not the only thing that drives population, but it contributes. Source 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
btw does it not seem overpowered that feral has passive movement, slow, and can shift slow/root? rhetorical question
Broadly speaking, we think the game is better when classes have powerful pros but also some cons rather than all mediocrity. Source 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
there aren't many changes to hunters in the 5.2 patch notes so far, would I be wrong to assume MM won't get the buff it needs?
The change buffed MM's damage. Can you explain how far you think they are behind with the change? Raidbots can't answer this. Source 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
At the highest RNG, Fire is okay. On average RNG, Fire sucks, and by sucks, I mean it's ridiculously low.
Raidbots suggests the standard deviation of both specs is pretty close. Source 

Why such a severe nerf to Rune of Power as Arcane? Seems to kill the effort vs. reward of having to stay in the same spot.
Trying to balance reward for using it correctly against penalty in those times when you can't. Source 

You forgot to answer his question. Tho, reading between the lines, looks like the answer is "switch to arcane"
Think I've said many times that Arcane is a bit high because Scorch lets them sit on 6 stacks all the time. Not our intent. Source 

So, our damage is too high, but other classes like Affliction Locks that do more damage than Arcane is fine?
Pretty sure I've said several times that Affliction is too high too. Source 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
BTW, what are the reasons to try and remove haste from prot pallies?
"WTF Bliz? Why put dodge on our tier sets. I'll just use Ret set." Source 

no offense, but you guys knew about Haste and Prot Paladins since well before live.
At the time we thought it was an undergeared problem because dodge doesn't matter when failing a dodge kills you. Source 
We still sort of suspect that's the problem but it's become such a mantra that it's worth changing anyway. Source 

Too gauche? So why warriors can not used carry daggers? It is a symbol of clumsiness as Ghostcrawler.
I think warriors will use any weapon but prefer the bigger ones. Paladins shun daggers for some code reason. Shrug. Source 

will you give back Ret paladins their divine purpose?
Unlikely. Despite the good arguments we hear, we're convinced many Rets would complain about forcing RNG on them. Source 

you talked about nerfing ret burst and buffing sustained dmg/mechanics. What happended to that idea?
We don't think the reaction from Ret players would be good overall. Would have to weigh that cost. Source 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
We have to cast PW:S 3 times every 12 seconds to net the same mana Rapture does, and it has to be effective healing.
Rapture isn't supposed to be a mana generation tool. It's to offset PW:S cost. Disc mana needs a nerf on live. Source 

Why does Shadow need to be nerfed? We haven't even seen PvP on 5.2. Premature.
We get very little PvP participation on PTRs. Mostly it's players theorizing about what changes mean which is still useful. Source 

For disc priests, do you think removing DA when PoH overheals rather than removing it entirely will be a better solution?
Potentially, but sometimes you want the bubble when everyone is full because big damage is incoming. Source 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
hi i know you are a busy man but have you taken any time to think about buffing rogues we suck thanks
We think they have been buffed in 5.2 a whole lot. Source 
Rogue buffing the result of ineffectiveness or population decline or both?
I've talked before about how DPS didn't seem to affect population in this particular case. Source 

Rogues get a bit of love in 5.2,but what if history holds and their pop still doesnt grow.What will be your next step if any?
Great question and we don't have an answer to share yet. We are looking at more exciting visuals. Source 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
would you mind explaining blizzards disregard for warlocks? Maybe justify our nerfs? It's the same thing every season...
No offense, but I think it's hard to claim "disregard for warlocks" in this expansion in particular. Source 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
On PTR the new TFB mechanic + overpower costing rage is makin it extremely difficult to keep hamstring up. Please take a look.
Well, that's kind of the point. Why have Hamstring cost rage if that cost is irrelevant? Source 

Does it make sense to you that a Mage can Blink out of a Stun but a warriors second wind shouldn't work?
The difference is the Blink is used once and then you can respond. There's no way to stop a SW unless you can out DPS it. Source 

Again nerfing warr's every 5 minutes after over a year of being gimped isn't a good fix, its no wonder people don't trust you.
I'm not sure if people trust me or not. I'm also not sure if that's important. Would be an interesting discussion. Source 

Character
So many ilvls of each piece + reforge + gems, enchants, enhances is making gear overwhelming. Too many choices/variables
Ignoring the damage it might do to professions, would you miss gemming and enchanting? Source 

Ever feel like there's too much focus on math in WoW? Reforging, DPS, HPS... numbers are too important. Not sure how to fix.
Players are really scared of being wrong, even if the delta is trivial. Much more likely to experiment in a single player game. Source 

I'm more concerned that the meta gem AH market will crash if most get free legendary metas.
Nobody said they were free. Nobody said they didn't cost metagems.... Source 

MoP seems to be harsher towards multiclass players. I know 'you don't have to do all your dailies', but to go to raids...
I think that's fair, but in the previous expansion players with one main ran out of stuff to do very quickly. Source 

Am I the only one who feels that they have the solution to separating PvE gear and PvP gear COMPLETELY from each other?
We wanted to have some overlap. However, current design seems to be having an even greater effect in the opposite direction. Source 

Very much agree. Those "BiS lists" irritate me.
I think knowing which item is your best piece is fine. That then gets turned into anything which is not that piece is "garbage." Source 

Do you intend to balance the tier set bonuses to ensure tier is better than off-set Thunderforged which is +6 ilvls?
Not sure. I sort of miss the days when players would take non-tier seriously if the stats were good enough. Source 
What days do you speak of? It was more like when set stat allocation was bad in addition to bad set bonuses.
It was also hard to complete sets. Some players had them, others had good stats to make up for the lack of the set. Source 

Have you guys thought about balancing racials a little better?It feels like no one really plays tauren,or gnome; human better
While I won't claim racials are perfect, I think what you are seeing is about graphics not racials. Source 

Tell me you are changing the tier 15 set bonuses for H Paladins. I don't want to nearly skip a tier and go from 517 to t15 hc.
We could have no set bonuses on T15 and you'd still want to upgrade because of the stats unless T14 is ridiculously over budget. Source 

No,actually,there is not a wrong choice.Wether weplayers buy new items OR upgrade old ones should be our decision,not DEV's.
Giving players the ability to make choices with wrong answers doesn't make players happy overall. Source 

PvE
This mostly affects the first wave of guilds tackling the encounters. I'm just curious if it's taken into account.
We balance the new tier with that ilevel in mind. Source 

Love the idea of the conquest catchup mechanism. Any chance we can see something similar implemented for Valor?
We like the idea for Valor too but want to see how it shakes out for Conquest first. Source 

What do you think about including some Lesser Charms of Good Fortune in the LFR consolation bag?
As we said in some of the 5.1 interviews, we plan on putting some better goodies in the consolation bag. Source 

Hey can you verify if the change in 5.2 to the 'failbag' will apply to 5.0 and 5.1 LFRs too? Or just the 5.2 LFR?
I can't yet. Definitely for 5.2 and 5.0 if we have time. Source 

Is Thunderforging the NA/EU equivalent/response to higher ilvl on Asian servers?
Asia will have Thunderforged too. Source 

I like the concept of the 'thunderforged' items, but dont let them drop while the world 1st race is on. I think its important.
Weapons drop or don't on the world first race right now and those are a bigger swing than 6 ilevels. Source 

I didn't see you guys reaching out to solve our problems, but you appear to work awfully hard to create incentives for 25s
While I am sorry for your individual situation, overall 10s are growing and 25s are shrinking. We don't like that. Source 
fix to the issue of raid sizes, remove both make 15m baseline also remove fiscal cost of server transfers
You are asking every raider in the world to grow their roster by 50% or prune 10 people. Feels pretty harsh. Source 

I recommend either acollapsing to one raid size, b going back to the Wrath model of decisive difficulty diff, or c equality
A Would be very cruel to all. B Potentially, but cruel to 10s. C Close to today, which feels cruel to 25s. No easy answers. Source 

Not to sound ignorant, but why don't you like people migrating from 25s to 10s? If ppl like 25 its its own reward
We don't buy that 10s are just more fun. Throughout WoW, one constant is that players gravitate towards efficiency. Source 

My guild lacks enough players to continue 25s, so we are forced to do 10s. But doesn't it look to you like we just like 10s?
Yes, and that's a problem. 10s are very unlikely to become 25s but the opposite happens all the time. Entropy. Source 

Instead of 'Thunderforged' why don't you just have items that drop that are consumed to upgrade items instead of VP? Simpler.
We want killing bosses on farm to stay exciting because of the chance of dropping a better item. Hard for tokens to be exciting. Source 

With this proposed Thunderforged idea, don't you think the iLevel focus and range is really getting out of hand?
It's 6 ilevels. We're not going to reach ilevel 1000 in this expansion. It may feel weird, but it still functions. Source 
I'm sure there was a reason for this, but why have TF items vs simply having items occasionally drop 1/2 upg already?
If we do upgrading in 5.3, then the drops become less exciting again because pre-upgraded not better than anything. Source 

I am confused. You say weplayers consume content too fast? Yet 5.2 is making current content obselete after what 4 months??
"Consume" doesn't mean complete. In this context it means "finish." Can be done with a raid even if you haven't cleared it. Source 

If LFR is meant to be the primary source of gearing up for a new raid tier, will lower LFR tiers get a higher chance for gear?
Yes. I think we improved drop chance, charm chance and made it easier to get charms. Source 

Any reason for the 5 dungeon per hour per account lockout? Could we at least double it? 5 is too low a # for low lvl dungeons
It's to discourage exploits. Do you really need to enter a new dungeon every 10 min? Source 

How come asian servers have 10/25 lockout seperately like WOTLK and have better ilvl for 25 man yet we dont on EU/NA?
Letting players play more isn't always a slam dunk. Witness current dailies debate. Source 
Much more controversial in NA/EU. Heard from many that ICC felt too much like a job. Source 

I'm excited about the PvP gear changes in 5.2. If the catch up feature works well can we expect to see it for PvE?
If it works well in PvP we'll definitely consider it. Source 


Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud 
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud  will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices  seem to have bottomed out for now, with almost all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte. This is the first month in a long time that there have been no amazing SSD sales. No new CPUs, GPUs, or SSDs worth waiting for are expected before the second quarter this year.

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 3770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions! If you are interested in Folding@home, take a look in our team's thread
