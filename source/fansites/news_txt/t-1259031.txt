Patch 5.2 - Ra-den Audio
Ra-den is the Heroic difficulty only boss found in the Throne of Thunder raid. There is still nothing about him in the Dungeon Journal, other than the little bit of lore.


<object width="853" height="480"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/1gU6_5OIk60?version=3&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/1gU6_5OIk60?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="853" height="480" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

Shrouded in Mystery - There are no scholars with any recollection or record regarding the details of Ra-den's powers. Perhaps these memories have been obscured by the passage of time, or perhaps none who saw the Keeper of Storms in battle ever lived to speak of what they witnessed....

Lei Shen's life changed forever when he stumbled into a dark chamber below what are now the Mogu'shan Vaults. Legend has it he found an ancient titan keeper guarding a miraculous device known as the Engine of Nalak'sha. No one knows what transpired between the two beings, but Lei Shen later emerged from the site bristling with the power to forge an empire. The keeper's fate -- and his current whereabouts -- remain a mystery.

Classes
You succeeded at Active mitigation - avoidance is by definition passive mitigation - regretting the change?
Nope. We think active mitigation is more fun. Just need to decide what to do about dodge and parry long term. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294581587620810752

Items with spirit on it. Holy vs disc vs shadow - which spec gets priority in your opinion? Causing gearing issues ATM.
IMO it doesn't matter that much. Too many healers think they must have Spirit in every single slot and they really don't. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294502706557640704
That said, we think the whole Spirit to hit thing is awkward and we'd like to come up with a better solution in a future expansion. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294502834119000065

Long term, are "pure" dps classes here to stay, or are you guys evaluating other options?
We talk about it often. I'm not sure all those pures would want to be hybrids though. Not as simple as oh just ignore that role. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294106474555265026
For the pures that want, it's a plus. For the pures that don't, they can deal with it just like all other classes
Maybe they picked pure so they wouldn't have to deal with it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294143098265669632

Tanks are still number 1 DPS for like all fights. It's a bit frustraiting as a DPS to not be able to compete. Concerns?
Can you name a specific fight? Dungeon? Raid? Happens on Mel'jarak because of the fight. Not common elsewhere. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294104201892618241

you are going to have to listen to the people playing the class and not all the ones playing everything else.
But the people playing the class are the most likely to think excessive buffs are reasonable. The others have a different pov. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293831179130507264
the others have the pov that no nerf is ever enough.
That can happen. It's really hard to have the objectivity to recognize the difference between overpowered and outplayed. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294101957071745024

Anyway you can balance out all the class specs so that there are no more FOTM specs? No best DPS spec, no best Healing, etc.
We try. There's math and then there are player reactions and we try to balance the two. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293439343459192833

So pls stop making drastic changes to mage pve spec,tired of having to regem/spec/test/learn a new rotation every month. 
The alternative is all the players who love X spec just can't play it. Not sure how to solve both. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293434165704151040

Theorycrafting ruined the game, it made everyone elitist and most specs "nonviable" because they do 5% less DPS.
No objections to theorycrafting overall. It's when stack ranks of DPS are offered as fact that it causes more harm than good. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293432755759484928

So you're more concerned with representation than balance?
There is often a relationship. Balance is not the only thing that drives population, but it contributes. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293427492025409536

btw does it not seem overpowered that feral has passive movement, slow, and can shift slow/root? rhetorical question
Broadly speaking, we think the game is better when classes have powerful pros but also some cons rather than all mediocrity. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293078940250165248

there aren't many changes to hunters in the 5.2 patch notes so far, would I be wrong to assume MM won't get the buff it needs?
The change buffed MM's damage. Can you explain how far you think they are behind with the change? Raidbots can't answer this. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293786211196223489

At the highest RNG, Fire is okay. On average RNG, Fire sucks, and by sucks, I mean it's ridiculously low.
Raidbots suggests the standard deviation of both specs is pretty close. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294104793075552257

Why such a severe nerf to Rune of Power as Arcane? Seems to kill the effort vs. reward of having to stay in the same spot.
Trying to balance reward for using it correctly against penalty in those times when you can't. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294099341503782913

You forgot to answer his question. Tho, reading between the lines, looks like the answer is "switch to arcane"
Think I've said many times that Arcane is a bit high because Scorch lets them sit on 6 stacks all the time. Not our intent. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294096161411842048

So, our damage is too high, but other classes like Affliction Locks that do more damage than Arcane is fine?
Pretty sure I've said several times that Affliction is too high too. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294094800637001729

"WTF Bliz? Why put dodge on our tier sets. I'll just use Ret set." Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294508651668971520

no offense, but you guys knew about Haste and Prot Paladins since well before live.
At the time we thought it was an undergeared problem because dodge doesn't matter when failing a dodge kills you. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294237921484087296
We still sort of suspect that's the problem but it's become such a mantra that it's worth changing anyway. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294238137599815680

Too gauche? So why warriors can not used carry daggers? It is a symbol of clumsiness as Ghostcrawler.
I think warriors will use any weapon but prefer the bigger ones. Paladins shun daggers for some code reason. Shrug. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294104007012671493

will you give back Ret paladins their divine purpose?
Unlikely. Despite the good arguments we hear, we're convinced many Rets would complain about forcing RNG on them. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293436992581148672

you talked about nerfing ret burst and buffing sustained dmg/mechanics. What happended to that idea?
We don't think the reaction from Ret players would be good overall. Would have to weigh that cost. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293430677829976065

We have to cast PW:S 3 times every 12 seconds to net the same mana Rapture does, and it has to be effective healing.
Rapture isn't supposed to be a mana generation tool. It's to offset PW:S cost. Disc mana needs a nerf on live. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293433464689139712

Why does Shadow need to be nerfed? We haven't even seen PvP on 5.2. Premature.
We get very little PvP participation on PTRs. Mostly it's players theorizing about what changes mean which is still useful. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293433218827427840

For disc priests, do you think removing DA when PoH overheals rather than removing it entirely will be a better solution?

Does it make sense to you that a Mage can Blink out of a Stun but a warriors second wind shouldn't work?
The difference is the Blink is used once and then you can respond. There's no way to stop a SW unless you can out DPS it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294106116785332224

Again nerfing warr's every 5 minutes after over a year of being gimped isn't a good fix, its no wonder people don't trust you.
I'm not sure if people trust me or not. I'm also not sure if that's important. Would be an interesting discussion. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293436693401436160

Character
So many ilvls of each piece + reforge + gems, enchants, enhances is making gear overwhelming. Too many choices/variables
Ignoring the damage it might do to professions, would you miss gemming and enchanting? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294165683401523200

Ever feel like there's too much focus on math in WoW? Reforging, DPS, HPS... numbers are too important. Not sure how to fix.
Players are really scared of being wrong, even if the delta is trivial. Much more likely to experiment in a single player game. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293437742333980673

I'm more concerned that the meta gem AH market will crash if most get free legendary metas.
Nobody said they were free. Nobody said they didn't cost metagems.... Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294511160642912256

MoP seems to be harsher towards multiclass players. I know 'you don't have to do all your dailies', but to go to raids...
I think that's fair, but in the previous expansion players with one main ran out of stuff to do very quickly. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294506078908076032

Am I the only one who feels that they have the solution to separating PvE gear and PvP gear COMPLETELY from each other?
We wanted to have some overlap. However, current design seems to be having an even greater effect in the opposite direction. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294504861372923904

Very much agree. Those "BiS lists" irritate me.
I think knowing which item is your best piece is fine. That then gets turned into anything which is not that piece is "garbage." Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294167797372698625

Do you intend to balance the tier set bonuses to ensure tier is better than off-set Thunderforged which is +6 ilvls?
Not sure. I sort of miss the days when players would take non-tier seriously if the stats were good enough. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294142658530660352
What days do you speak of? It was more like when set stat allocation was bad in addition to bad set bonuses.
It was also hard to complete sets. Some players had them, others had good stats to make up for the lack of the set. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294166733676244993

Have you guys thought about balancing racials a little better?It feels like no one really plays tauren,or gnome; human better
While I won't claim racials are perfect, I think what you are seeing is about graphics not racials. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294105814560550912

Tell me you are changing the tier 15 set bonuses for H Paladins. I don't want to nearly skip a tier and go from 517 to t15 hc.
We could have no set bonuses on T15 and you'd still want to upgrade because of the stats unless T14 is ridiculously over budget. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293078286102298624

No,actually,there is not a wrong choice.Wether weplayers buy new items OR upgrade old ones should be our decision,not DEV's.
Giving players the ability to make choices with wrong answers doesn't make players happy overall. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293077385518133249

PvE
This mostly affects the first wave of guilds tackling the encounters. I'm just curious if it's taken into account.
We balance the new tier with that ilevel in mind. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/292735817540050944

Love the idea of the conquest catchup mechanism. Any chance we can see something similar implemented for Valor?

Hey can you verify if the change in 5.2 to the 'failbag' will apply to 5.0 and 5.1 LFRs too? Or just the 5.2 LFR?

Is Thunderforging the NA/EU equivalent/response to higher ilvl on Asian servers?
Asia will have Thunderforged too. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294143464902361088

I like the concept of the 'thunderforged' items, but dont let them drop while the world 1st race is on. I think its important.

I didn't see you guys reaching out to solve our problems, but you appear to work awfully hard to create incentives for 25s
While I am sorry for your individual situation, overall 10s are growing and 25s are shrinking. We don't like that. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294266888828112897
fix to the issue of raid sizes, remove both make 15m baseline also remove fiscal cost of server transfers
You are asking every raider in the world to grow their roster by 50% or prune 10 people. Feels pretty harsh. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294510425427558401

I recommend either acollapsing to one raid size, b going back to the Wrath model of decisive difficulty diff, or c equality
A Would be very cruel to all. B Potentially, but cruel to 10s. C Close to today, which feels cruel to 25s. No easy answers. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294266332726317056

Not to sound ignorant, but why don't you like people migrating from 25s to 10s? If ppl like 25 its its own reward
We don't buy that 10s are just more fun. Throughout WoW, one constant is that players gravitate towards efficiency. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294503629409366016

My guild lacks enough players to continue 25s, so we are forced to do 10s. But doesn't it look to you like we just like 10s?
Yes, and that's a problem. 10s are very unlikely to become 25s but the opposite happens all the time. Entropy. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294095633470603264

Instead of 'Thunderforged' why don't you just have items that drop that are consumed to upgrade items instead of VP? Simpler.
We want killing bosses on farm to stay exciting because of the chance of dropping a better item. Hard for tokens to be exciting. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294265559044988928

With this proposed Thunderforged idea, don't you think the iLevel focus and range is really getting out of hand?
It's 6 ilevels. We're not going to reach ilevel 1000 in this expansion. It may feel weird, but it still functions. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294168113082163200
I'm sure there was a reason for this, but why have TF items vs simply having items occasionally drop 1/2 upg already?
If we do upgrading in 5.3, then the drops become less exciting again because pre-upgraded not better than anything. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294174320442351616

I am confused. You say weplayers consume content too fast? Yet 5.2 is making current content obselete after what 4 months??
"Consume" doesn't mean complete. In this context it means "finish." Can be done with a raid even if you haven't cleared it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294165298960027649

If LFR is meant to be the primary source of gearing up for a new raid tier, will lower LFR tiers get a higher chance for gear?
Yes. I think we improved drop chance, charm chance and made it easier to get charms. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294105318596698113

Any reason for the 5 dungeon per hour per account lockout? Could we at least double it? 5 is too low a # for low lvl dungeons
It's to discourage exploits. Do you really need to enter a new dungeon every 10 min? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293438053920407552

How come asian servers have 10/25 lockout seperately like WOTLK and have better ilvl for 25 man yet we dont on EU/NA?
Letting players play more isn't always a slam dunk. Witness current dailies debate. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293435755315990529
Much more controversial in NA/EU. Heard from many that ICC felt too much like a job. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293435660600242176

I'm excited about the PvP gear changes in 5.2. If the catch up feature works well can we expect to see it for PvE?
If it works well in PvP we'll definitely consider it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293434752898314240


Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/february/ssdgraph.gif seem to have bottomed out for now, with almost all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte. This is the first month in a long time that there have been no amazing SSD sales. No new CPUs, GPUs, or SSDs worth waiting for are expected before the second quarter this year.

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 3770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx and Nvidia http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/290-Computer for any extra questions! If you are interested in Folding@home, take a look in our team's thread http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/948557-MMO-C-folding-team.
