Well, Blizzard doesn&apos;t really need you, but they&apos;d be very happy to hear your feedback on your class.

Blue posts<br>
A few noteworthy blue posts today, it seems that they had to remove the useful Vendors in boats and zeppelins, there isn&apos;t any official reason but we can assume it&apos;s because of a very important bug or exploit.<br>
Transporation Vendors Removal<br>
The vendors on the Boats and Zeppelins throughout Azeroth have run out stock and shut up shop, they are no longer able to service you with their wares. (Source (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=1905770654&amp;postId=19052191740&amp;sid=1#0))<br>

BG Daily quest display issue<br>
There is a known issue where re-logging after completing the daily battleground quest will result in your honour estimation displaying incorrectly. Please note that this is just a display issue, and any honour you are owed should be applied as normal the next day.

Warrior<br>
The bug allowing Warriors to Intercept/Intervene through the whole map (http://youtube.com/watch?v=fRcEa1sIHEw) as long as the target was in range in the first place will be fixed in a future patch.

Death Knights<br>
No final decision has been made on whether ther will be an additional slot or not to let people create a Death Knight character. For the moment it looks like people will have to delete one of their character if they don&apos;t have any slot left but it could be changed in the future.

Dalaran<br>
Quests around the current location of Dalaran shouldn&apos;t be changed with the expansion.
