Boubouille2007-05-20, 08:05 AMUpdate : Item tooltips should be fixed, we're back to the "old" version to see if it works, please report any bug.

Blizzard has been heavily testing an encounter lately, and nearly all the loots seems to be "available". They arent from Illidan ilvl 141, it should be 151 so ... basically it means we've got the Essence of Souls loot table, or the Illidari Council loot table, hurray for us ? The uber loot compilation should be available shortly since someone requested it in comments.

Dreadboots of the Legion 
Boneweave Girdle 
Grips of Damnation
