The Secret Finding Discord (https://discord.gg/wowsecrets) has solved Fabious (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/169201-fabious)! You&apos;ll need to break out your S.E.L.F.I.E. Camera MkII (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/122674-s-e-l-f-i-e-camera-mkii) and head to 25, 29 in Nazjatar. Once Fabious spawns, you&apos;ll need to take a selfie with the NPC and the mount will be yours!<br>
