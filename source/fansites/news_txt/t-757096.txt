The first part of the Cataclysm prologue just started on live servers. Alliance player will find the Operation Gnomeregan event in Dun Morogh and Horde players should go to Durotar for Zalazane's fall. See the quest links below for more information.
Cataclysm Prologue - Gnomeregan and the Echo Isles 

Important - The events are fairly short and entertaining, I really suggest that you go play them on live servers instead of checking the screenshots.

This is a very fun questline, it's not too long and it's a pretty nice introduction to what will happen in Cataclysm! For more details on the quests please read:
