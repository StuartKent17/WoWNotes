Thanks for the feedback and thoughts so far.<br>
<br>
The Refer-A-Friend system is intended as an option for players who want to invite a friend to play WoW with them and experience the game together. When it was first introduced, we gave it a hefty bonus to experience gain as a way for both players to reach endgame content as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
Nowadays, purchasing the latest WoW expansion includes a free character boost, so the need to rush your friend to max level is no longer there; you can jump into the latest content with your friend right away. This meant that the only players who were using the Refer-A-Friend system in its intended way &#x2013; leveling alongside their friend &#x2013; were those who had decided that they wanted to experience that content together. We realized that, for those players, the 300% XP bonus was a disservice; we were cutting that shared experience short by making them finish it far too quickly.<br>
<br>
Now, we certainly recognize that the majority of people using the Refer-A-Friend system before these changes were doing so in order to level alts quickly. If anything, we take that as a strong indication that the system needed to change: the best method to level a character in WoW shouldn&#x2019;t be &#x201C;buy a new copy of the game, put it on a separate account, send it a Refer-A-Friend invite, level a new character, and then transfer that character to your primary account when you&#x2019;re finished.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s messy, at best.<br>
<br>
That said, we&#x2019;re certainly taking the feedback about the rate of leveling alts into account as we move forward with the game&#x2019;s development. We&#x2019;ve been happy with the changes so far, but if leveling is too slow, we&#x2019;d rather address that in the game itself than have Refer-A-Friend be some kind of bizarre workaround to an outstanding issue.</div></div>
