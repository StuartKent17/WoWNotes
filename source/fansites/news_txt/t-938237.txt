Patch 4.2 Hotfixes - July 14
A couple more of Firelands Raid balancing hotfixes today!
July 14

Dungeons & Raids
Baradin Hold

The Eye of Occu’thar shared cooldown on Focused Fire has been increased, while eye health has been decreased.


Firelands

Ragnaros

Molten Elementals can no longer be knocked back while having the Molten Power buff. Molten Elemental move speed has also been decreased by 15% on Heroic difficulty. These adjustments will require a realm restart to take effect.

Rhyolith

Concussive Stomp damage has been increased on Heroic difficulty.
Eruption now increases fire damage taken by 5% per stack, down from 10%.
The Eruption debuff is now cleared when transitioning into phase 2 of the fight.

Shannox

Successful attacks on Rageface will now always be critical strikes while he is channeling Face Rage.
Players on the legendary quest Delegation should now be able to get the Dull Emberstone Focus charge off of Shannox’s spear more easily, so long as it’s placed within 50 yards of the spear.



Quests & Creatures
Hyjal Regrowth & Molten Front

Players should no longer experience performance issues when the Fire Hawk Egg Carry Ping spell is cast while on the quest Peaked Interest.


Nexus A Legendary Engagement

Shaman Grounding Totems now properly redirect Thyrinar's primary Twilight Blast ability.

"Incentive to explore older raids in the future"
Besides, there should be some added incentive to explore those older raids in the future anyway. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/185816/i-dont-understand-blizzs-vp-logic / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2795074028?page=4#69

Valor Points
That's a significant part of the thought process, yes. Also, Valor Points are intended to reward top quality items, and we don't think that they should be trivial to obtain in any significant numbers. Allowing them to persist in older content once new raids are added would defeat that purposes.

Real ID Party as a "Premium" feature
I said this as a response on the blog and I'll post it here as well:


We greatly appreciate constructive feedback about this, but as we mention in the FAQ above we'll have information about a cost for premium services at a future point in time. For now, all anyone is able to do is "guess" at what this could mean. Let's focus on testing for now and avoid supposition about any sort of cost at this point in time. It's too easy for people to get involved in hearsay that is inaccurate or misleading.

We know people have concerns over this and get a bit itchy about the word "premium", but for now the answer we can give is the one in the FAQ. Your constructive feedback though is helpful in the testing of the feature and will help us make sure it's serving the community in the best possible way. What we want to avoid is people getting ahead of themselves and guessing at prices or spreading misinformation or rumor. We want this to be successful. We want the community to find value in it being available to them.

This is just one of several ways in which people can get together with their friends whether that includes them relocating realms and factions or not. It's simply an additional choice that will hopefully make your time in the game more enjoyable for you and your friends. It's not any more sinister than that.

Real ID Party cost
In other words, we have not announced an associated cost with this at this point in time and it's free for testing currently. Anything beyond this is merely conjecture on people's parts.

Leading a Real ID Party / Dungeon Finder
It should be restricted to you as the party starter as the primary Real ID holder and passing the group lead should not allow the other person to invite additional RID people of their own. That's my understanding of it and why we updated that question a bit to make it more clear. Now, should you find that it's working otherwise, I'd love to hear of it.

Essentially, you as the originator of the group have Real ID. You have friend A on one realm and friend B on another but you're RID friends with both they would need to have RID enabled too, even if they don't know each other, you can invite them because YOU are RID friends with them both. You can then invite additional people from your own realm if you don't have any other RID friends to fill it in with and go into the dungeon, or you can choose to enter the Dungeon Finder and let it do the work of filling in the rest of the group.

This is my current understanding and it should be functioning this way. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/185792/new-real-id-party-available-for-testing / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2838414159?page=13#241

Arena / Battlegrounds / Raid / Cross-Faction RealID Grouping
This is as of yet to be determined, much like the requests for Real ID Party for Battlegrounds, Arenas or Raids. There are a lot of technical limitations to consider and try to work within. We'll keep everyone informed should any of these come to pass as something we plan to add as a part of the feature.

RealID Party and multiple WoW licenses on the same Battle.net account
There's a known issue that doesn't allow the feature to be used at all if someone is logged into multiple World of Warcraft licenses on the same Battle.net account. It has nothing to do with inviting yourself, multiboxing, etc.

It's a bug, and we are aware. : Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/185910/cross-realm-real-id-no-multiboxer-support / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2842434419?page=2#35

Divine Aegis using the Power Word: Shield Animation
Divine Aegis using the Power Word: Shield animation is just temporary. The problem with the old animation was that Divine Aegis is used so much it caused for a bit too crazy of a light show. We love having awesome spell effects, but they can easily be overwhelming in a dungeon or raid situation with boss and player spell effects firing off like mad.

We plan to revise the Divine Aegis spell effect in an upcoming patch. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/185906/divine-aegis / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2842564560?page=1#2
