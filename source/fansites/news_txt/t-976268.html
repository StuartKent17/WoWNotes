The design called for &quot;phosphorescent mushrooms, reminiscent of Zangarmarsh,&quot; so our main concern was avoiding making a helm that looked like a giant toadstool sombrero. We&#x2019;re always looking to incorporate interesting light sources within a raid set, and bioluminescent vegetable growth certainly provides that. Twisting, organic shapes are often key elements of a druid set, and this tier is no exception, with writhing plant roots providing a frame for the glowing clusters of fungi.<br>
