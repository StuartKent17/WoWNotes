Runelock Chest WQ Changes<br>
We&#x2019;re adjusting the &#x201C;Runelocked Chest&#x201D; World Quests with a hotfix that changes the requirement from matching colors in a row to completing a specified total number of matches.<br>
<br>
I&#x2019;m not sure how long this is going to take to change, but we&#x2019;ll have it noted for you in our hotfixes list.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hotfixes: June 26, 2019<br>
Player versus Player<br>
<br>
The total number of points required for a faction to win the Battle for Nazjatar War Mode event reduced to 3000 (was 10,000).<br>
<br>
Quests and World Quests<br>
<br>
Players will no longer need to relog to turn in the quest &quot;Saving Corin&quot;.<br>
Players can now turn in &#x201C;Scouting the Pens&#x201D; to Neri.<br>
<br>
World<br>
<br>
Players can no longer loiter at the teleport location for the Heart of Azeroth quest line in Highmountain.<br>
Cursed items found in Nazjatar will now take longer to affect your character, and the detrimental effects have been reduced.<br>
Fixed a bug where being mounted while interacting with Arcane Device would cause visual issues.<br>
Prince Wiggletail is now easier to defeat.<br>
Moved certain Chitterspine crabs in Bitterstone Cove that were out of line of sight behind the water wall.<br>
Duration of Glimmershell Fluid reduced to 2 minutes (was 30 seconds).<br>
Upon re-entering the zone, previously selected combat allies will once again join your side in Nazjatar.<br>
Weeping Sanya now spawns upstairs so she no longer interferes with the puzzle World Quest in the same building.<br>
Due to many harsh lessons learned from gravity, we are increasing the &quot;Slow Fall&quot; spell duration obtained from the top of Kal&apos;methir Citadel from 15 seconds to 30.</div></div>
