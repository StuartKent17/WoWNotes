You probably remember my post in November http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/player-gets-all-achievements-shadowed-unit-frames/ about a Taiwanese player who had all the achievements in the game. A few months later, Caspi from Refuge EU-Taerar http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Taerar&cn=Caspi&gn=Refuge reaches a new record and is the first player to complete all the achievements currently available in-game, including a 25-man heroic Lich King kill. Congratulations to him!
