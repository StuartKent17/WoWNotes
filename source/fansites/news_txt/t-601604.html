From Curse-Guild.org (http://www.curse-guild.org)<br>
&quot;As leaders of Curse Guild, we are proud to announce a new partnership with the major E-Sports organisation Meet Your Makers (MYM). This will offer us the support and backing that we need to bring the team to its full potential. We have existed as Curse for several years now but the time for us to move on to something new and exciting has come. Since the release of World of Warcraft we have been one of the top guilds competing for PvE progress and with this partnership we believe that this will only improve in the future.&quot;<br>
