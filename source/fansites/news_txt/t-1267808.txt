Patch 5.2 - Isle of Thunder Rare Spawns
We already talked about http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3081-New-5-2-Rare-Spawns-5-1-Hotfixes-5-2-Set-Bonus-Issues-5-2-Raid-Testing-Blue-Posts the new rare spawns that drop some of the Direhorn mounts, so let's take a look at the new rare spawns on the Isle of Thunder. Thanks to Simca http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/545200-Simca for helping to gather much of this information. You will need to kill these ten NPCs to earn the http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/581/280/16/16/inv-shield-mogu-c-01.jpg Champions of Lei Shen http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/8103-champions-of-lei-shen achievement.

The rest of the rare spawns have a chance to drop a Key to the Palace of Lei Shen http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94222-key-to-the-palace-of-lei-shen and Shan'ze Ritual Stone http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94221-shanze-ritual-stone.

Patch 5.2 - Quest / Rare NPC Sharing
One of the complaints that often came up in the Blue Tweets was people "stealing" mobs during daily quests or when killing a rare spawn. Patch 5.2 attempts to make things a little bit better with a new system that lets you share mobs. Currently, any mob that is flagged as a quest mob on live gives you credit when you participate in the kill, but Patch 5.2 takes this one step further. 

When you encounter another player killing a rare spawn or quest flagged NPC, you can just start to help them kill it. Doing so will increase the maximum health of the NPC by 50% and give you a chance to win loot, completely separate from the other player. If someone else comes along to help out, this will increase the health by another 50%, and give them a chance to win loot as well. You will still get loot with just one hit while the mob is alive, even if combat drops. 

This system allows anyone from either faction, in your group, solo, or in another group to take part in killing these NPCs and get a chance at the loot, without affecting your loot chances. For now, it only works for the new rares and big quest mobs introduced in Patch 5.2. Please note that this does not work for normal quest mobs Kill 20 of X..., only the bigger ones that are usually named and have an icon on their unit frame.

Blue Tweets
Classes
My point is that you have never been able to balance classes in the past, this makes it even harder.
But players want their guy to be the highest DPS so they don't have to switch. Not sure how to solve that. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301066066849849344
I think it's impossible to balance say Fire, Frost and Arcane to be identical on every single boss. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301065886364749824

Positive feedback on what basis? Because on the PTR the seal hasn't been working correctly at all.
While actual testing is the most valuable, I'd say we get 75% of our feedback just from player reaction and theorycrafting. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301551845007036416

Survival Hunters - Black Arrow shares a cooldown with Explosive TRAP. Working as intended, but why? This baffles me.

Are you nerfing Silencing Shot because noone uses Wyvern Sting and Binding Shot? I think a better answer is SS as baseline! 
Silencing Shot is really powerful and the short CD just felt like too much. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/300330176066240512

Why can BM hunters Use Stampede in arena, And Dks cant use Army of the dead, It would be fun for Unholy to have this in arena.
There is a teensy bit of damage potential between the two. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302530152481566720

why nerf arcane into the ground instead of buffing frost with a small arcane nerf?
Because Arcane is ahead of everyone else along with Affliction. We'd have to buff everyone else including the bosses. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301073575736115202

would you consider the possibility of efficiently leveling as a Holy paladin or ranged dps paladin new spec?
Have you tried it in MoP? Ranged Judgment with Holy Shock and Denounce works pretty well for DPS. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301073393388756992

GC, most Rets today are crying for sustained damage and not burst. Please re-evaluate this outdated assumption.
Go look at my Twitter feed a month or two ago. I speculated we could nerf Ret CDs and buff sustained. The earth trembled. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301072914554445825

You know, youre giving WW an obscene buff in utility all around yet you give ret some small gimmick buffs. We need massive aid
There are like 5x as many Ret paladins as all monks put together. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301079017350631425

Could you explain why you won't change Devotion Aura to also include Phys damage 5.2? At least for Holy Paladins.
We don't want every CD to be a carbon copy. Mantid just happened to have a lot of physical AE. Not the case for every boss. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/300329242498039809

The 20% mindblast increase is a promising first tweak for shadow priests. Any chance mb haste scaling from ptr will come back?
Explain why your DPS needs it. What percent of relative DPS will you lose in the course of 5.2 because of scaling? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301077576892428288

instead of buffing mind blast damage, why not scale the cd with haste? Would help stat scaling a bit.
Will your relative DPS drop 10% over the course of a tier because of haste scaling? If not, why does it matter? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/300332397747118080

When are you going to stop focusing on disc all the time and pay some MUCH needed attention on holy? PvE
We think Holy is in a really good place. They just get overshadowed by Disc so their representation is low. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301076727172579328

And you still lose 25% output in the stance you're not in while no others healers have to deal with this. Why?
Chakra is the Holy priest resource. You could ask why Holy paladins need to build up Holy Power before using WoG or EF. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301033694360133632
chakra is a resource alright, a resource for frustration, and will to bump my head in the wall.
Holy without Chakra is just a generic healer, a Molten Core priest. If you don't like Chakra, probably not a good spec for you. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301566803723825154
I know you've talked about doing that before, and it really is the only way to make Chakra actually fun.
We agree it would be more fun with more different spells per stance. Making swapping super easy just makes swapping not a thing. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301574486254288896

Let me ask you this, do you think Sanctuary, in its current state, is a good spell?
A good spell, yes. A high HPS spell, no, and it wasn't intended to be. You can layer it with other heals though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301566165392699392

so disc priest wont crit anymore but get a bubble instead... why are you nerfing priest so much? Being oom constantly sucks.
Your crits will "only" be 130% but now non crits will be 130% too. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302866223715192833

will pws critting simply mean pws absorb is 2x or does it create da for 100% when crits? For pvp I hope it creates da.
PW:S crit is just a double absorb. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302523444216602624

how many patches will the devs ask and wonder why rogues pop isnt high enough when we have been telling you for months energy
Not a recent phenomenon. My pet theory is rogue pop started to drop as soon as gank -> guaranteed kill became less likely. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302861406636740608

regen is TOO low, therefor the class is SLOW and UNFUN, want to bring your rogue players back up? Increase the sodding regen!

PvE
Hey , i was wondering if the gear without a drop source on the new raid are trash loots or arent going to be implemented ?
Normal drops trash loot and there is no heroic trash. In LFR, you can get those pieces http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-difficulty-type=4&filter-patch=16408&filter-set=0&filter-ilvl-max=540 from the bags that only have gold today. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302867215710048256

Ra-den Limited attempts? Seriously? I am disappoint, #LevelALLTheAlts!
At some point, cutting-edge guilds making 500 attempts a week is no longer a test of skill. It's a test of endurance. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302864096502620160

And that's not my standard. That's standard.
The intent of Ra-Den is to be insanely difficult. Most heroic guilds should not consider him a part of progression. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302869329383407617

thunderforged increases logistics problem for 25. It makes things worse. If this is the only solution this expansion...

I could see that if the 5.0 raids were en masse on farm, but they aren't. Most raiders haven't cleared Terrace.
Most raiders have, because they play LFR, and they're ready for something new. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302531806937374722
How many % of players raid lfr, and how many % of players raid hardmodes? Have you got any current numbers?
I do, but it's probably not appropriate to share them. A whole lot of people do LFR. Very few do heroic raids. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302866777677901824
That should not be interpreted as developing heroic raids is a waste of resources. We don't agree with that conclusion. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302866901745426432

What is "the Mechanar Syndrome"? I've noticed you have mentioned it several times.

You mean like dailies? Perfect example whether intended or not.
Mmm, not really. A better example would be if Klaxxi offered more valor than Golden Lotus so everyone just ran Klaxxi. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302201259065237506

do you take those metrics into account when tunning drop chances? Just curious, not complaining.
No, we're worried that would cause a vicious cycle. We drop gear by number of potential users, not current class popularity. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301816453680742400

this is crude and simple but true. current progression: LFR-----------Normal---Heroics. should be: LFR----Normal-----Heroics
Some of the normals had berserk timers that were a little tight. If you beat the mechanics you should probably win N but not H. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301563386951520256

Challenge Mode dungeons are great fun! How do you feel their acceptance is? Above or below expectation? Or on par?
I think we will see more players do them as they run out of other content to do. We always knew their niche would never be huge. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301562407799627776
