*Item levels 890 and 900 above will become available when the Nighthold raid opens.

The item level of PvP gear rewards from Skirmish, Battleground, Arena, and Rated Battlegrounds victories will increase with Season 2, but the transmog look will remain the same as Season 1.

Faction-based Rewards
Don’t forget—end-of-season rewards are based on your faction nowadays. The top 0.5% of Alliance PvPers will be awarded the&nbsp;Gladiator: Legion Season 1&nbsp;achievement and mount, and the same will go to the top 0.5% of Horde PvPers. If you transfer your character to the other faction, you must have 50 wins after your transfer to receive the reward.

Now get out there and fight to the finish!
