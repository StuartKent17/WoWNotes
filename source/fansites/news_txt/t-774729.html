Mounts and Items Removed in 4.0.3<br>
As stated in the Under Dev page (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/), patch 4.0.3 brings about The Shattering, a cataclysmic event that will forever change the face of Azeroth. As we prepare to raise the level cap and introduce two new races with the Cataclysm expansion, it&apos;s important to keep in mind that the game world is going through tremendous changes that will affect the availability of certain rare mounts and items.<br>
<br>
Swift Zulian Tiger<br>
Zul&apos;Gurub is changing from a raid to a leveling zone in 4.0.3, and this mount will no longer be obtainable.<br>
<br>
Swift Razzashi Raptor<br>
This mount will also no longer be obtainable after the change to Zul&apos;Gurub.<br>
<br>
Razzashi Hatchling<br>
With the change to Zul&apos;Gurub this non-combat pet will no longer be obtainable.<br>
<br>
Tome of Polymorph: Turtle http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage<br>
This tome will continue to be available through other means.<br>
<br>
Crusader&apos;s White/Black Warhorse and Swift Alliance Steed/Swift Horde Wolf<br>
As the attempt-based tribute system is being removed from Heroic Trial of the Crusader, the Argent Crusade Tribute Chest will no longer spawn, and these mounts will no longer be obtainable<br>
<br>
Reins of the Blue Drake<br>
This mount will once again be available from defeating 10-player Malygos without needing to use the Dungeon Finder. The Reins of the Azure Drake will only be available on 25-player Malygos.<br>
<br>
Mimiron&apos;s Head<br>
This mount will change to be a very low drop chance when defeating 25-player Yogg&apos;Saron with no Keepers assisting you<br>
<br>
Invincible<br>
This mount will change to be a very low drop chance when defeating Heroic 25-player Lich King<br>
<br>
Although we have no current plans to introduce new ways to obtain the Zul&apos;Gurub mounts, pets, and the tribute mounts, they may return should we find a place where they fit in the future. <br>
