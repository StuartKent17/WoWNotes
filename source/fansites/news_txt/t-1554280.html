Don&apos;t understand devs&apos; love for players standing still. Movement is fun.<br>
So is caring about the specialness of movement, and the gameplay value of it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487760088795336705))<br>

What&apos;s the intent with new blood 4pc? Blood shield can&apos;t deplete, so immune to physical damage for 10sec?<br>
Your Shield can&apos;t drop below X% of your health; ie, every hit on you, Blood Shield will at least absorb that much. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487755376087953408))<br>

SI really gone for balance? Barkskin is so weak in comparison even with a 30second cd<br>
Barkskin is generally regarded as stronger, especially in PvP. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487748990486601729))<br>
I get killed with barkskin up almost every time I queue. And SI would help a lot more in raids since druids have no immunity<br>
With the Barkskin glyph? It&apos;s extremely strong in PvP. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487750293740740608))<br>

Are you even considering changing the new MM mastery? .. I would like to PVP as MM .. dont ruin my spec please<br>
I&apos;m not sure how that ruins your spec. It&apos;s valuable for PvP, situationally (and is optional anyway). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487750513484517376))<br>
stand still in PVP, hunters need to kite all the time, or else we get instat wrecked. It never goes off in PVP<br>
You should try harder to get some stand-still time in. It is absolutely possible. You only have to stop for 3 sec. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487754545053724672))<br>
only hunter def is roar of sacri, and one talent row. That is no where near other classes. You cannot face tank melee or casters<br>
And Deterrence, and Disengage, and the other defensive talent row, and traps... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487758624622538752))<br>

yes, thanks for reply. Speaking about heating up fade on none crit hit. The grace delay was a good fix 1/2<br>
We feel like the grace delay worked well. It may need some slight retuning after the responsiveness fix, though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487745674939609088))<br>

And in the category of nearly mandatory talents: Spirit Shell at Level 75. http://t.co/s5xP9BnOGs<br>
We think that&apos;s an interesting choice because Spirit Shell is not necessarily a throughput gain, whereas the others are. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487743120231002112))<br>

MM, ele and arms masteries changed for being too similar to MS. Why not combat?<br>
Combat&apos;s Mastery we changed to offhand dmg; has interaction with your other abilities. We decided it was different enough. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487742712121024512))<br>

Is the Echo of the Elements ui notification final? Looks like it&apos;s hard to see and not as flashy as Lava Surge &amp; Fulmination.<br>
No. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487686965265850369))<br>
<br>
I know it&apos;s MOLTEN earth, but sounds like it should be nature damage.<br>
Nature is heavily overloaded, unfortunately. Rocks/Earth doing damage are typical physical, and we didn&apos;t want this to be ... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487746660965949441))<br>
...affected by armor, or weirdly bypass armor.&quot;Nature&quot; damage is crazy. Poison, Solar, Plants, Lightning, Earth, Wind, Chi, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487747190345834497))<br>
<br>
Minor Glyph to make Molten Earth for Shamans summon Pandaria Earth Spirits.<br>
It doesn&apos;t summon anything. Heard that misconception several times now, perhaps there&apos;s a better way to word the tooltip. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487744138368929794))<br>
&quot;incite the earth around to come to their aid&quot; Since shamans call Elementals for aid, &quot;incite&quot; sounds like the earth comes alive<br>
In a way, it does, but they&apos;re not units, they&apos;re missiles. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487745178061398016))<br>
is this the same stone missiles the ogre shamans use in frost fire ridge?<br>
Very similar, but more polished for players. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487747563978637312))<br>
<br>
about new Ele mastery, will CL last target be the one you cast or the random one hit by the last chain?<br>
First target. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487760587409985537))<br>
<br>
Did the cool lightning from sky visual effect got scrapped for ele shammies? ;(<br>
I reckon that that was not the last you&apos;ll see of that visual. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487781930956365824))<br>
<br>
Any chance LB for EnhShaman will be revisited? Or is hardcasting LB as melee (to avoid MW overcapping) part of our skillcap?<br>
Part of your skillcap. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487845735056941056))<br>

Any chance you&apos;ll ever take WS off the GCD? Fury still feels terrible as is.<br>
It&apos;d feel worse with WS off the GCD. You&apos;d have a *ton* of rotational deadtime. Would feel extremely slow. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487748011133382657))<br>
<br>
&quot;Tanks now take 25% additional damage while engaged in PvP combat.&quot; Does this count Protection warriors in Glad stance too.<br>
Currently, no. It&apos;s something we could do if needbe, but don&apos;t think it&apos;s needed currently. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487754848180264960))<br>
<br>
...2 RB, bloodsurge proc, and full rage, no matter what we do feels wrong. Rage capping, wasting RBs and letting enrage fall...<br>
In that case, you should be doing WS-WS-WS-WS-WS-WS-WS-WS-BR-RB-RB-BT. No lost rage, or RBs. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487749999451582464))<br>
Did BT get a massive nerf/change in your build? You really prioritize it last? Dump to 0 rage / 0 RB before you BT...<br>
During a CS? Absolutely. It&apos;s the lowest DPCT. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487755497089425408))<br>
<br>
does Sudden Death&apos;s Execute proc increase based on rage or will it be as if we had minimum rage?<br>
Currently, yes. Strongly suspicious that that&apos;s too strong, though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487756370083450880))<br>
<br>
Prot Warriors can continue to avoid/block while in Bladestorm dispite the tooltip removing that description. intended?<br>
Yes. That wording was removed from several tooltips to make them more understandable. No functional change. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487846269574868992))<br>
<br>
Art<br>
Will Yrel have a custom, unique model like Jaina,Vol&apos;jin etc or will she use a heavily modified version of new Draenei female?<br>
Yrel&apos;s model has a couple custom elements, but isn&apos;t a whole unique model like Velen or Khadgar. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/487673677400403968))<br>

Character / Items<br>
color variation artists have made whenever you want, for a fee<br>
I love the idea of dying armor like Diablo did. I get a little worried with user-made content, because we&apos;re internet people. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487488224647184384))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
so you&apos;re fixing small details to the flag points that no one looks at when you could fix mmr and stop 0 point games<br>
The artist that made this flag post does not work on the MMR system (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/487942602415546370))<br>
<br>
Could we get any information regarding the Tournament realm when it&apos;s coming up and so on or is it top secret?<br>
We&apos;re finalizing details to share. Sorry for the delay. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/487717957808566272))<br>
<br>
Does the damage against Tanks stack higher if they are carrying a flag In a Normal or Rated BG?.<br>
The damage debuff for flag carrying remains the same so they&apos;ll stack (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/487775294510481409))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
Do Garrisons have specific music? Would be awesome; for example variation of vanilla Orgrimmar music.<br>
They have their own music, but you can get a boom box that lets you change the music (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/488014619647418368))<br>
