WoW Cataclysm @ Dreamhack
As you probably know, the Dreamhack Winter 2009  was held in Jönköping this week and people could play Cataclysm here. I never had a chance to post in-game footage of Cataclysm in the past and I thought it was a good occasion to do it since "someone" was nice enough to provide decent footage with a decent =not too awful quality, thanks to him/her/it.
