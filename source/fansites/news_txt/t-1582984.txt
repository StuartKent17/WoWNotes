Warlords of Draenor - Weapon Enchants
Today we are taking a look at the new weapon enchants and Illusions added in Warlords of Draenor. Three of the new effects listed below are Illusions, which are weapon enchant transmogs  available to those who have the Enchanter's Study  building in their Garrison. This building doesn't appear to function correctly in the current beta build, but it should offer many enchant transmogs  Flames of Ragnaros  is unique, as it is an item and not a crafted Illusion.

Warlords of Draenor - Rare Spawn Mount Drops
Muffinus shared  some information about the Warlords versions of the Time-Lost Proto-Drake style mount drops.


  


Warlords of Draenor - Call to Arms Removed
We've removed Call to Arms in Warlords. Originally, the feature was added to bring some variety to the battleground experience and allow players who like a specific battleground to occassionally binge on it. But, like any feature, we have to weight the benefits with the consequences. Call to Arms has an adverse affect on queue times in a pretty profound way. When certain battlegrounds are up, one faction will tend to queue for Call to Arms while the other tends to avoid it. As a result, we're going to remove it so that the majority of players are queuing through Random Battlegrounds.


Beta Stability Issues - 8/28
We're currently aware of the stability issues you folks are seeing on the beta realms: usually presented as either a difficulty staying online for an extended period of time, or getting disconnected when attempting to login to one or more characters.

These issues are known to us, and we're trying to back up to 100% capability. Our Server Engineers are doing a lot of the behind-the-scenes work to fix things like this. I'll be updating this thread with more info and/or any ETAs as I receive them.

So basically there's a few things going on here: The restarts are issued for a number of reasons, sometimes to pickup some code changes that we push out to improve stability, like fixing a client or server crash.

Another issue that has happened the last few days involves some actual hardware. It gets a bit technical, but the short version is that you may run into disconnects or issues loading anytime you try to access the instance server. This also means garrisons are impacted, since they don't "live" on the Draenor continent. 

Anyway, the real thing to take away here is that our server folks are working on this and keeping a very close eye on things. 

We've completed our maintenance on the Beta Realms, although we'll keep a close eye on the overall stability of the realms.

Classes
Mount speed nerfs for DK's/Pala's is this an oversight or legit?
Due to the additive vs multiplicative changes, yes. Celestalon 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
How did you find your time as an Unholy DK yesterday? Speaking as a casual PvPer, interested in seeing how things look post-NS.
Similar to other classes it is nice to have less buttons. Loss of double grip might make Gorefiend's Grip more attractive. holinka 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Not sure if its been brought to your attention, but resto druid healing seem to be OP-Using only two buttons 
Yes we're bring rampant growth down to 50% perhaps even more if necessary. holinka 

would it be possible to bring Hibernate back to WoD? It was a pretty fun CC for the druid to have. It definitely was very useful
No we're glad to have removed a lot of those niche use, rarely used CC buttons. holinka 
Meanwhile: "Think of it as "that niche spell that I sometimes get to use skillfully for great gains"."
Arena players tend to want classes to become increasingly complex, because all arena has for depth is class design. holinka 
The rest of the game including PvP parts like battlegrounds and Ashran does not work this way. holinka 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Agree, from the looks of it monks were hardly changed. They have way too many ways to disrupt casts.
In comparison to most classes, monks didn't have many abilities. They didn't really need much pruning. holinka 
Ah ok They have a lot of stuns, disarms and that. I'll keep an eye on notes in case I missed CC changes.
They lost their disarm, their silence & CC break trinkets work better vs fists of fury & ring of peace. holinka 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
stop that you're going to get us paladins cheesing the beacon macro nerfed. #intended #unfunplaystyle
.Relately, we're going to make a change that skews away from the Beacon macroing: a tiny mana cost. Celestalon 
Won't be a ton; the intention is that moving your beacon around frequently is still viable and min/maxy. Celestalon 
Just a bit to nudge away from doing it wastefully. Thinking 1000mana. Celestalon 

Do the level 90 Holy Paladin talents really need a mana costthat HIGH? Similar other class abilities are much cheaper/free.
They should still be very efficient. Cost offsets their high healing, while not being restrictive. Celestalon 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Rogues will have too many ways to stop casts.Deadly Throw didn't need a buff, it'd be fair if DT replaced Kick.
It wi require 5 pts to interrupt in the next build. holinka 

Character / Items
there will be *no* Benediction transmog in the 10th MC raid, right?
Nothing Benediction/Anathema-related in the anniversary raid, no. WatcherDev 

PvE
Is 7min enrage on twin ogron mythic intended as well? We hit that at 30%
Berserk timers are intended; health is artificially high. WatcherDev 

you said LFR would be smoothing out spikes to make it easier than mists due to not dropping tier - now it’s remaining the same?
Mists LFR wings varied a lot in difficulty. We'll be smoothing out those peaks in Warlords. WatcherDev 

Will it be possible to go Quest > Normal Dungeon > Heroic Dungeon > Normal Raid in Warlords, or is LFR a required step?
It will not only be possible, but is in fact the expected path for people who want to do organized raiding. WatcherDev 

PvP
The 'Kick' bonus - how does this help vs. melee? 2pc bonus only valuable vs. casters? I don't understand 
PvE bonuses don't work in PvP. Versatility bonuses are all undertuned. holinka 

small detail in WoD but has a huge impact: being able to take queues while in combat. Queuing arena during Ashran with no worry=win
.Indeed, we think it will be great to participate in Ashran, or the rest of the world for that matter, while you wait in queue. holinka 

do you envision ashran as something that will be used in future xpaks? Or just WoD
Ashran will be a part of the Warlords of Draenor expansion but much like old raids, it's relevance will diminish afterwards. holinka 
If it's successful we'd probably do something new based on lessons learned. holinka 

How long have you invisioned Ashran and why was something like it not made sooner? I'm strictly PvE but not anymore! Thanks #Ashran
A number of reasons. First, some of the technology necessary to pull it off. Second, the design resources to make it. holinka 
But we think it's great to introduce a new kind of PvP content to the game which we think has broad appeal. holinka 
I agree. Queing is ok, but jump right in and play is the best! Interesting gameplay I think all PvP/PvE players can enjoy. #Ashran
.A lot of people grinded High Warlord/Grand Marshal back in the day but have no interest in Arena/RBG. So adding Ashran too! holinka 
What does that mean do we have chance to get those titles from playing ashran?
No those titles are not available from Ashran holinka 
It means there are people out there who like PvP enough to grind hours for those titles but they don't like instance PvP. holinka 

World
True story: the original farm supports different outcomes based on weather and seasons, but I cut them to reduce complexity _DonAdams 
did you just say you dumbed down the farm too? Thanks, Blizz! That would have been awesome!
It *supports* those things, but they were never implemented. That is not dumbing down. _DonAdams 
I should also point out that the original farm was 6 plots at best. So it's actually way bigger than planned. _DonAdams 
Not doing a thing you originally wanted to do is the day to day reality of game dev. You cut and trim. _DonAdams 
In the end I'm very proud of the farm, even if I wanted to do more with it. That's most of our content. _DonAdams 

Misc
Random question, but do you know why there's such an absence of blue responses on the WoD beta forums? It's very discouraging.
Simply because it's extremely time consuming to do, and there's none of us dedicated to doing it, so only in spare time. Celestalon 
... monitoring and providing feedback then what the hell is the point? Might as well bury your head in the sand
Reading and Responding are two *extremely* different things. We do read all the feedback, with dedicated people. Celestalon 


Warlords of Draenor - Tanaris Changes
Forum users CosmicGuitars  and Reignac  noticed  some interesting changes in Tanaris. A new Infinite Vanguard  NPC has appeared outside of the Caverns of Time, along with a Black Morass style portal a little bit farther out. A total of 7 new Infinite NPCs  were added in Warlords.
