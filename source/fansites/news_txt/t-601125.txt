Boubouille2007-03-10, 08:25 PMAt first, I wasn't planning to make Karazhan guides, but lately i realized with the Karathress guide that most of the people are still making their attunements here.

There was one problem though, i've never been in Karazhan or in any instance actually, this is why i need raid guides writers. ^^ and there are a lot of bosses which make the process of creating a guide for each one based on friend's feedback pretty slow.

But Soul Society http://nordrassor.freehostia.com/phpBB/index.php from US-Deathwing server saved the day ! I would like to thanks the whole guild and especially Naggrodamus who allowed me to use the guides on the website. 

I will probably add screenshots when i've got more time. Missing bosses/events should be added soon too. probably tomorrow, i'm kinda short on time tonight
