Dragonwrath, Teracgosa's Rest - Questline
After going through things and stuff and poking at even more stuff, I eventually got the entire questline for Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest. 

According to that screenshot released by Blizzard  I wouldn't be surprised if some of the very important of the questlines were played as in-game cutscenes.

A Legendary Engagement  / A Legendary Engagement 
Objective - Speak to Anachronos in the Caverns of Time.
Description - I expected that I would find you here, <class>. But then, we of the bronze flight have somewhat of an advantage when it comes to such things.

*Coridormi smiles.*

For reasons unknown to me, my master seeks audience with you. I would counsel you not to take this invitation lightly, <name>. Anachronos seldom has cause to interact with mortals. Wisdom would dictate that you seek him out in the Caverns of Time at once. 

Speak to me when you are ready and I shall personally deliver you.

A Wrinkle in Time 
Objective - Speak to Anachronos in the Caverns of Time to witness the future of Azeroth.
Description - Listen carefully, <class>, for though we are only beginning, time already grows short and the consequences of our failure are unfathomable. An event in the recent past has been obscured from my vision by the most powerful of magics. Its impact, however, has not. 

If action is not taken to change the course of this timeline's future, the outcome is clear. Brace yourself, mortal, and behold the future of Azeroth.


All-Seeing Eye 
Objective - Collect 25 Living Embers  from Firelands and 3 Sands of Time 
Description - I perceive the questions that burn within your mind and I must confess that I share in your uncertainty... a rare position for one such as I, and a most unsettling one. As I scour time to find traces of this obscured event, you must aid me in the creation of an Eye, both to test your worthiness, and to provide an essential tool in the unraveling of this mystery. 

Venture into the Plane of Fire, <class>, and gather Living Embers. Bring them to me with Sands of Time and I will create the Eye.

On a Wing and a Prayer 
Objective - Bring the Timeless Eye to Coldarra.
Description - Time well spent, mortal. 

While you were struggling in the Plane of Fire, my watchers and I were able to determine where and, most importantly, when our vision was obscured. We have discovered that the shroud was placed over the Nexus, far to the north in the realm of the blue dragonflight. 

I have attuned the Timeless Eye  to show you the occurrences that remain hidden to us here. Go at once to Coldarra and search out a place suitable for the Eye's activation. 

Travel well, friend.


Through a Glass, Darkly 
Objective - Use the Eye of Eternity at the Nether Vortex in the Nexus. Meet Tarecgosa inside the Nexus where she will escort you to the rift.
Description - Tarecgosa listens as you explain your presence in Coldarra.

Your tale rings true, <class>. Much has changed since the death of Malygos - little of it for the better. I know of the device you carry, and I recognize Anachronos' magic in its creation. There is but one place in all of Coldarra that would allow this Timeless Eye to be used discreetly. 

You will need my assistance if you hope to succeed. Speak with me again inside the Nexus and you shall have it.


Actionable Intelligence 
Objective - Speak to Kalecgos at Nordrassil in Mount Hyjal.
Description - <Tarecgosa listens intently as you describe your vision.> 

Impossible! Not even Arygos would dare to go to such lengths. I do not question your integrity, <class>, but you must understand - your mortal mind can easily be deceived. 

Regardless, Kalecgos must be informed of these events. You must travel to Nordrassil at once to seek him out. I shall remain here to conceal the evidence of our activities. Speak of this to no one else!


Delegation 
Objective - Recover the Branch of Nordrassil  from the Firelands.
Description - I am duty-bound to look into your claims immediately, <race>, which means my mission here now must fall to you. A surge of ancient magic, far too strong to have occurred naturally, drew me here. I have since discovered a most troubling development. 

A bough from Nordrassil has been ripped from the tree and taken deep into the Firelands. There, a powerful ritual threatens to corrupt Nordrassil, consuming it in flame. You must find a way to interrupt the ritual and reclaim the world tree's branch.


Nordrassil's Bough 
Objective - Speak to Kalecgos to offer him the Branch of Nordrassil 
Description - Much has transpired since last we spoke. I have taken it upon myself to visit the Nexus and recover Anachronos's artifact, but not before using it for myself. Now I too have witnessed that which you have seen. 

Before discussing the matter further, allow me to express my gratitude to you for your assistance, both here and in the Plane of Fire. Give me the Branch of Nordrassil, <name>.


Emergency Extraction 
Objective - Accompany Kalecgos to Coldarra. Speak to him when you are ready.
Description - Now, back to the matter at hand... I am convinced that the vision in the Nexus is one of Deathwing's illusions designed to bring conflict into our flight at a very fragile time. The Worldbreaker would only be strengthened were we to fall to infighting. 

Still, a gnawing sense of unease tempts me to take a path of caution. It would be wise for me to take Tarecgosa and withdraw until the time of choosing.


At One 
Objective - Speak to Kalecgos to agree to his proposition.
Description - I was charged with her protection, yet it was she who sacrificed herself for my sake. I cannot bear to lose her, <name>. I must make a solemn request of you. 

Never has a mortal borne the essence of a true dragon, but with your permission I would make an exception. Please, while there is life in her, will you allow me to bind Tarecgosa to you? 


Time Grows Short 
Objective - Collect 25 Seething Cinders  from the Firelands.
Description - Tarecgosa is bound to you, <name>, but only temporarily. An aspect's power is required to permanently seal her essence. Malygos's successor will not be chosen until Azeroth's moons next eclipse, and the bond you share will not last until then. 

Fortunately, there is a way to buy us the time we need. Powerful elements exist that can extend the ritual's effects. Some of these can be found in the Plane of Fire, with which you've become familiar. Obtain them, <class>, and sustain Tarecgosa until the eclipse.


Alignment 
Objective - Accompany Kalecgos to the blue dragon council. Speak to Kalecgos in Coldarra when ready.
Description - The time of choosing has arrived, <name>. While only members of the Blue Dragonflight may attend, Tarecgosa's binding makes your presence requisite. 

I must ask that you take on her form and vote on her behalf. Do not tarry. The moment of the eclipse draws near....


Heart of Flame 
Objective - Obtain the Heart of Flame 
Description - You are the first mortal to witness a dragon council, <name>, and among the only beings in Azeroth to take part in the choosing of an Aspect. My ascension has endowed me with incredible power. I have taken the liberty to strengthen Tarecgosa's bond with you, though she will require a more... permanent home. 

I would have you venture one last time into the Plane of Fire and bring me the heart of Ragnaros. When next we meet, I will be able to suitably thank you for all that you have done.


The Stuff of Legends  Temporary name?
Objective - Speak to Hallegosa / Witnessed Kalecgos Ceremony in Stormwind
Description - It is an honor to make your acquaintance, <race> Your deeds echo in the ears of Azeroth's creatures, mortal and immortal alike. 

I shall present the heart of Ragnaros to Kalecgos when he arrives. Its power is to be harnessed to further endow your weapon. The ceremony is to begin shortly. I have been appointed to escort you there when you are ready.

VO_QUEST_42_LEGENDARY_DEATHWING_03 - Your reign, over the realm of magic will be absolute. Even after the hour of Twilight.

VO_QUEST_42_LEGENDARY_DEATHWING_05 - Cross me, and your punishment will be greater than the madness he suffered!

VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_ECLIPSE_01 - Brothers, sisters, Arygos speaks of our troubled past.
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_ECLIPSE_02 - Indeed, we have suffered greatly.
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_ECLIPSE_03 - But, I would contend that we are, at least, partly to blame for the scars we bear.
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_ECLIPSE_04 - Let us turn from our old ways.
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_ECLIPSE_05 - Let us not seek to extinguish magic from the world.
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_ECLIPSE_06 - But to use it responsibly for the benefit of Azeroth and all its inhabitants.

BlueSentry
