With 4.2, we&#x2019;re introducing the new World of Warcraft Dungeon Journal. The feature is currently deep in development, so while we don&apos;t have anything to show off just yet, we&#x2019;ve put together a FAQ with a bit of information. Please enjoy!<br>
<br>
Q: What is the Dungeon Journal?<br>
<br>
A: The Dungeon Journal is a new piece of UI in World of Warcraft that players can use to find out more about specific dungeons, and the bosses within those dungeons, including what abilities they have and the rewards they offer.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: How will I access it?<br>
<br>
A: While in a dungeon, hitting &quot;M&quot; (the default key for Map) will open the Dungeon Journal. A new button will also be available in the navigation tray. The Dungeon Journal can be accessed from anywhere - in a dungeon, in a raid, on a boat, etc. <br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Will I have to experience a dungeon or encounter in order to see the associated Dungeon Journal content?<br>
<br>
A: There won&#x2019;t be any &quot;gating&quot; or limitations placed on what content a player can see in the Dungeon Journal. All boss/dungeon/raid information will be available to all players regardless of level, gear, or content experience.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: What will it show me?<br>
<br>
A: The dungeon/raid map will display the locations of each boss in their respective locations, marked by unique icons.<br>
Players can access boss information by clicking on boss icons on the map, or by clicking on the boss&#x2019; name in the associated tab of the dungeon/raid map page.<br>
<br>
General loot information for the dungeon/raid can also be accessed from the dungeon/raid main page by clicking on the Loot tab. This will show all loot dropped - from bosses and trash - in the instance, of a certain quality.<br>
<br>
Boss abilities will be available via the boss&#x2019; page, either by clicking on the map or by going through the Dungeon tab. The Dungeon tab on the boss&#x2019; page will list out all major spells, abilities, and phases for that fight.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Are the descriptions going to be simplified or detailed?<br>
<br>
A: Descriptions will be verbose and complete. Our goal is to give a lot of context to the abilities in terms of how they&#x2019;ll play out; however, we will not be giving any strategy tips in the Dungeon Journal. For example, while the Dungeon Journal might say something like &quot;This ability will cause all players in the affected area to take damage,&quot; it won&#x2019;t say anything explicit like &quot;All players except the tank should stand behind the boss during his Shield phase.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Will this include adds?<br>
<br>
A: Yes. If a boss has adds, like Ascendant Council or Erudaxx, their abilities will be listed, too.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: What bosses will be included in 4.2?<br>
<br>
A: That&apos;s still being determined. We want to include as many as possible and add more as we go along. We&apos;ll provide additional information on availability as we progress through the Public Test Realm process.<br>
<br>
<br>
We&apos;ll provide a more comprehensive look at the Dungeon Journal, including the interface and examples of the information it provides, as we move closer to the release of 4.2. Have fun storming the castle!</div></div>
