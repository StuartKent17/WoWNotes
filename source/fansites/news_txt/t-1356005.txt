Elite PvP Gear
.Is it permanently or temporary because of the conquest cap bug at the start of this season. 
The elite set only providing armor is permanent, although there is nothing to say this won't change in future seasons. The Elite Grievous gear is only giving armor because it's designed as a transmog set, rather than gear you would need to spend gold to enchant and gem again. It's also not intended to provide better stats than the normal set, it's meant to make your gear different and more identifiable to signify the prestige of your accomplishment. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Burden of Eternity Rarity
We like the extra rarity that comes from requiring multiple Burdens to get perfectly-itemized 535 gear. The gear is very good, so we don't want it to be too easy to get a hold of the best possible pieces. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Cross-Realm Looking For Group
Why can't you guys at blizzard just implement a dedicated LFG crossrealm browsing/listing system?
That is definitely a good idea but like always, it’s mostly a matter of time and resources vs current needs.

Many of the ideas from some of the top addons have in the past been integrated into the default game UI. 
I agree that this would be a great tool to have but I also believe that this is nothing new to the devs. I’m pretty sure they are quite aware about the current needs for such a tool, especially now that we have such flexibility with all the cross-realm functionalities.

The raid browser, for example, was an early attempt at tackling this. It worked out somewhat ok initially but subsequent iterations weren’t as successful. I suspect the reasons for this were the introduction of LFR and not having a dedicated button on the main interface a lot of players still don’t know about its existence. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Legendary Quest Items
It's only 1 attempt per boss per week across all difficulties. 

If you already completed Siege of Orgrimmar wings 1 and 2 for Secrets of the Empire  they won't drop a Titan Runestone  If you haven't completed Throne of Thunder wings 3 and 4 though, you can run that with Lei Shen being a 100% guaranteed drop..

As a side note, only the first 8 bosses in SoO have a chance Sha of Pride is 100% guaranteed just like Lei Shen to drop items for Wrathion's legendary quest line. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Flex Raiding
How is personal loot and loot being distributed between 10/25 players even close to being the same thing?
The point is that neither system is intended to have no waste, which is what seemingly was being requested. Source 

Now I'm confused. I thought flex was targeted at a different demography from LFR, normal and heroic? Running both = burnout.
My point was it gives you something to graduate to. Normal guilds graduating to heroic has been a thing since we launched heroic. Source 

Reputation / Questing
Really think questing/endgame/rep need to go backward a bit. Wrath is by far the fav WoW Expac in all polls. Maybe look why?
We find it's hard to extricate the story and world from the gameplay even in people's minds. Source 
For example, I love Northrend as a place and all of the various story arcs. I've always been a nerubian fan. Source 
But would the LK rep grind or dungeon grind transposed to Pandaria turn it into another Wrath of the LK? Not convinced of that. Source 


Heroic Garrosh 25 Asia Defeated
Blood Legion  wasn't the only guild to kill Heroic Garrosh 25 recently. Stars is still around in Asia and killing bosses, this time with a 576 item level group. You can see the final moments of the kill below.
