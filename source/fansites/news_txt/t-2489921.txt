Raid Testing Schedule - June 7th
On Friday June 7th, we will be conducting Mythic raid testing in The Eternal Palace.

June, 7th

Za’qul, Harbinger of Ny’alotha - Mythic Eternal Palace
13:00 PDT 16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST
Blackwater Behemoth - Mythic Eternal Palace
14:00 PDT 17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST
Orgozoa - Mythic Eternal Palace
15:00 PDT 18:00 EDT, 24:00 CEST

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a test environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.

Q: How do I get into the raid zone?
A: In Zuldazar, Boralus, Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade III in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.

Q: What character should I use to test the raid?
A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players’ effective level to 120 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounters being tested.

Q: How long does testing last?
A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we’re satisfied that we’ve received that information for a given boss, we’ll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.
