Blizzard posted clarifications on how Challenge mode rewards will play out at the end of the season.<br>
Countless adventurers continue to brave the most trying versions of Mists of Pandaria dungeons, but the clock is ticking. This &#x201C;season&#x201D; of Challenge Modes will be coming to an end with the upcoming release of a patch prior to the expansion&#x2019;s release.<br>
<br>
Challenge Modes are designed to offer as close to a &#x201C;normalized&#x201D; difficulty as possible, and they&#x2019;re tuned to be tough to master. With Warlords of Draenor&#x2019;s class changes, itemization changes (e.g. the removal of Hit and Expertise), and&#x2014;of course&#x2014;increased level cap on the horizon, the difficulty of Mists of Pandaria&#x2019;s dungeons will no longer be tuned the same as they were. In the spirit of fair play, when the aforementioned patch is released a little while before the new expansion launches, the current slate of Challenge Mode dungeons will no longer be available, and the achievements they award will be converted to Feats of Strength. The reward items will still be available for purchase by those who qualified prior to the end of the season, but it will not be possible for new players to earn those rewards going forward.<br>
<br>
If you still need to earn your Undaunted title, Ancestral Phoenix, or class-specific Transmogrification sets, now&#x2019;s the time to get out there and prove your worth. In Warlords of Draenor, an entirely new set of Challenge Modes will be available . . . and with them an array of new rewards for you to earn. Until then, stay sharp!<br>
<br>
* Reward Clarifications<br>
<br>
With the upcoming end of the Challenge Mode Season, we wanted to provide some additional clarification on how we plan to handle rewards.<br>
<br>
Achievements: All Achievements associated with Mists of Pandaria Challenge Modes will become Feats of Strength.<br>
<br>
Rewards<br>
<br>
Bronze: The &#x201C;Undaunted&#x201D; title for achieving a full set of Bronze medals will become account-wide.<br>
Silver: The Pandaren Phoenix mounts awarded for a full set of Silver medals will become account-wide. If any character on an account has earned a full set of Silver medals, all four variants of the Pandaren Phoenix (Crimson, Ashen, Violet, and Emerald) will become available to all characters account-wide.<br>
Gold: The cosmetic class sets will remain character-specific. Any character that has earned all nine Gold medals will still be able to repurchase the appropriate set, should they misplace theirs, from Challenger Soong or Challenger Wuli in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Any characters that have earned one or more &#x201C;Challenger&#x2019;s Path&#x201D; teleport spells by earning Gold medals in Mists Challenge Modes will retain those spells.<br>
Realm Best Titles: There are extremely limited titles that are held by the players who hold the best clear time for a given dungeon on a given server. Since those Challenge dungeons will no longer be available in Warlords of Draenor, their respective titles are also being permanently removed. There will be new Challenge dungeons in the upcoming Warlords season, and new titles for which to contend, however.</div></div>
