Patch 5.0.4 Download Size<br>
The update is going to be quite large and the background downloader should already be preparing you for the 29 of August. It will be approximately 6GB in size and will include all of the Mists of Pandaria content including Talents, Glyphs and stats.<br>
<br>
You will need to wait for the release of Mists of Pandaria to play Pandaren and you must upgrade your account to play a monk.<br>
<br>
The 21GB download is only if you are doing a completely fresh installation. If you are patching to 5.0.4 from the current patch then it is a great deal smaller, approximately 6GB. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/233290-504-question/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5168468138?page=3#43))<br>
<br>
Reward Currencies: Conversions, 5.0.4, &amp; You!<br>
Can you continue earning JP/HP if you pass the soft cap of 4000. Remember, HARD CAP was removed (and that will only be from August 28 - September 25) since Valor and Conquest will convert to their lesser forms and any excess will go over the cap?<br>
<br>
The second question is currency conversion. When 5.1 drops (which is probably MoP), will we keep some JP/HP and have excess converted to gold; will all of it be converted to gold; or will no conversion happen?<br>
Yes, starting August 28, you can earn as much as you want, since there&#x2019;s no cap at all on the Justice and Honor currencies from that day, until September 25. With Mists of Pandaria, the caps will be applied, and players will be reduced to 4000 Honor and 4000 Justice &#x2013; any excess points will be converted on September 25 to gold at the rates described before.<br>
<br>
Are they seriously going to remove conquest points from regular BGs? One of the best changes in cata, and they&apos;re already going to take it away? <br>
Nope! There are no plans to remove Conquest from the Random Daily Battleground. We agree that it was a great change!<br>
<br>
What will be the conversion rate? Is it 1:1? or is it 2:1?<br>
On September 25, excess Honor over the cap will be converted at a rate of 35 silver per point, and excess Justice over the cap will be converted at a rate of 47 silver per point.<br>
<br>
Conquest points will be converted to Honor Points with patch 5.0.4. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/233093-reward-currencies-conversions-504-you/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6369528059?page=14#267))<br>

LFR Feedback<br>
It would be useful if we could form a guild group and set our own loot rules, essentially the same process we use in norm/heroic.<br>
Within LFR, boss loot is handled on a per-player basis using the new system, regardless whether you queued as a full group or used the matchmaking features. You should still be able to change the loot method you use to handle any drops from the non-boss creatures in the instance if you are a full premade, but the boss system is hardcoded.

150 Mount Achievement Update<br>
I&apos;ve discussed this a bit with Cory Stockton (Mumper (https://twitter.com/mumper)). There won&apos;t be a new mount achievement with the launch of Mists of Pandaria, though we&apos;ll consider adding one in patch 5.1. We agree that it&apos;s probably time to set a new bar for mount collectors. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/233199-150-mount-achievement-update/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6368648362?page=1#5))<br>

Account Wide Feedback for PvP Mounts<br>
I don&apos;t mind being called out on this. I didn&apos;t abandon anything, but I did get caught up in other tasks and didn&apos;t get back to you all like I had intended. I apologize for that. It wasn&apos;t my intention at all. (Yes, I&apos;m a community manager, not a developer (and a she just for clarity&apos;s sake).) <br>
<br>
I&apos;ve been working behind the scenes a lot lately with the team to get more information out to everyone on a variety of things as well as getting ready for the Mists of Pandaria launch, but I don&apos;t intend that to be an excuse.<br>
<br>
A few things just to be clear on the PvP mounts and what I know.<br>
<br>
There was a period of time in the beta in which some PvP mounts were erroneously showing that they couldn&apos;t be given/used on other characters. This was a bug that should have been corrected. That bug did not apply to the Gladiator Mount or the Rated Battleground Mount. <br>
<br>
The decision on the Gladiator Mount or Rated Battleground Mounts hasn&apos;t changed. The developers still want these to be character specific as they apply to that particular class and season.<br>
<br>
While I didn&apos;t respond again, I definitely did carry the feedback to the team. Other PvP mounts you get outside of those should be account-wide as it was originally intended to work that way within the beta.<br>
<br>
That all said, I have no doubt that the developers will continue to assess whether or not this is something they want to change in the future, but this is how it&apos;s working for now.<br>
<br>
I do appreciate everyone that took their time to share their feedback whether it was in those threads, twitter, or even via email (yes I got some.)<br>
<br>
Just of note, if there are particular mounts (beyond the Gladiator and Rated Battleground mount) that you&apos;re concerned about, feel free to post and let us know. We can always look into them to make sure everything is working &quot;as intended&quot;. <br>
<br>
I know it wasn&apos;t the answer you were hoping for, but it&apos;s what I have for you at this time. We always reserve the right to change our minds though, so while the answer today is &quot;no&quot; on those mounts, you never know what could happen in the future. <br>
<br>
Believe it or not, we have a lot of people here who love PvP as well (I&apos;m one of them), so while we may not always agree on what that means, please do know we do in fact care about it.
