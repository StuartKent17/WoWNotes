Shard of Exodar Nerf
While we do think the Shard of the Exodar http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/132410-shard-of-the-exodar is slightly overperforming, we've been discussing the 7.2 redesign and aren't happy with it, particularly in regards to some usability issues that the change created. We're going to revert the change from Patch 7.2 in an upcoming PTR build, and look into other potential tuning options for the future.
