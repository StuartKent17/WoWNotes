Upcoming Honor Items and Honor Reset - Update<br>
Reposting this message because a very important update was made concerning all of the gems that can be purchased with honor, they won&apos;t be bind on pick up or unique-equipped anymore and players will be able to sell them at the AH.<br>
As many of you know we will be featuring a new Battleground, a dedicated world PvP zone and all new PvP items in Wrath of the Lich King. In order to make the transition from The Burning Crusade to Wrath of the Lich King flow as smoothly as possible, all accrued honor points will be reset at the launch of the expansion. We do this to ensure select players do not have an unfair advantage at level 80 from stockpiling honor to instantly purchase the newest Wrath of the Lich King PvP rewards. For those with unspent honor points prior to the release of the expansion, we will be offering a few upgrades and special rewards in next content patch solely for purchase via the honor system.<br>
<br>
Update:<br>
All of the gems that can be purchased with honor will have the Bind on Pickup and Unique-Equipped tags removed so multiples of them can be equipped and they can be traded (or auctioned). The new items that will be available are: <br>
<br>

Blue posts<br>
WotLK on CD or DVD ?<br>
World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King will only be available on DVD, not on CDs. That goes for both the regular box and the Collector&apos;s Edition. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/16/5901920572-wotlk-on-cd-or-dvd.html))<br>
<br>
Reminder - ZA Bear Mount<br>
The current plan is to make it unobtainable with the upcoming patch. We are still doing some testing on this but this is how it should go. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10532274087-za-bear-mounts.html))<br>
<br>
Traveler&apos;s Tundra Mammoth<br>
This is fixed in the next build. You will be able to ask your vendors to leave (Eject!) and friends in your party may then take their seat. <br>
<br>
The &quot;Mammoth-Tech&quot; completely changed. If you bought the old Grand Caravan you&apos;re out 15k. Sorry! If you have the Traveler&apos;s Tundra Mammoth you&apos;re ok for upcoming patches (no need to buy another one). <br>
<br>
Loremaster Achievement<br>
Ok, here are the new numbers. They won&apos;t be in (most likely) until two beta builds from now:<br>
Horde - Eastern Kingdoms - 550 / Kalimdor: 700<br>
Alliance - Eastern Kingdoms: 700 / Kalimdor: 730 <br>
<br>
Drak&apos;tharon Keep - Heroic Mode<br>
The version of Trollgore you have is insanely brutal due to a bug that makes his Crush ability land as the exact same time as one of his melee swings. We&apos;ve already fixed him internally, but I&apos;ll see if we can hotfix Trollgore so you can get past him and do the rest of the dungeon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/10539063854-924-feedback--draktharon-keep-heroic-80.html))<br>

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/deathknight.jpg Death Knight (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=650) / Talent Calc. (8982) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br>
Death Knight now do double damage on melee and spell crits<br>
Death knights now do double damage on melee and spell crits. Normally spell crits are only 1.5x damage.<br>
<br>
This was an intended change. Death knights derive a lot of damage from spells, but not so much that it made sense to give them a talent to increase spell critical damage. It&apos;s just a passive bonus for them.<br>
<br>
We were worried about certain specs not scaling as well with high levels of gear. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10043234158-gc-any-info-on-the-100-spell-crits.html))<br>
<br>
Blood of the North changes<br>
We were pretty convinced that there was no way Frost could do comparable damage to the other trees without Blood Strike hitting harder. No matter how you slice it, you eventually need to use Blood Strikes. Since this was the talent that made you not feel guilty about hitting Blood Strike, it made sense to put it here.<br>
<br>
Howling Blast does a little less damage for me than Obliterate with no diseases, but about the same or higher with a disease. Given that Howling Blast can hit many targets, AND that it can do 200% crits now (which Frost gets a lot), it seems pretty potent to me. Check it out on the next build. If the damage is still low, there may be a bug somewhere. <br>
<br>
Heart Strike damage should be higher<br>
I believe the Blood Strike damage is correct and the Heart Strike damage didn&apos;t get updated before the build. Heart Strike should hit harder. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10043283890-blood-strike-doing-more-damage-than-heart.html))<br>
<br>
Frost spec damage boost<br>
What we are finding now is that Frost&apos;s sustained dps seems to fall behind Blood and Unholy. We think this is partially because of Bloody Vengeance in Blood and the extra disease damage from Unholy, but also because Blood and Unholy&apos;s 51 do sizeable damage.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re going to make up Frost&apos;s damage in a couple of ways -- buffing Obliterate and Howling Blast, but also Icy Touch. A few months ago, Icy Touch actually hit for serious damage, and we think that&apos;s probably okay for the Frost DK.<br>
<br>
(We don&apos;t want Hungering Cold to be CC and AE damage, since it would likely suck at both or be too powerful, and it overlaps a lot with Howling Blast already. We also don&apos;t want to just keep buffing Frost Strike because it is already a huge chunk of Frost&apos;s dps.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/8765690666-suggestion-killing-machine.html))<br>
<br>
Death and Decay &quot;nerf&quot;<br>
Crypt Fever was removed from its damage, though apparently not for everyone? That shouldn&apos;t have affected the damage for Blood and Frost though. We&apos;ll try to figure out what happened. We had no intention to nerf it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10043234047-death-and-decay-stealthnerf.html))<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/hunter.jpg Hunter (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=620) / Talent Calc. (8982) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter))<br>
Changes to suit the new instant cast time of Aimed Shot (See this post (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10043283732-upcoming-hunter-changes.html))<br>
We&apos;ll have to tone down the damage of Aimed Shot actually, probably in the ballpark of less than what it is now but more than what multi-shot does to a single target or arcane shot. We have not yet settled on the appropriate number.<br>
<br>
In terms of their duration and cooldown, I think those are pretty in line with the Warrior variant. The idea behind this change is that the Hunter was intended to be a source of the &quot;mortal strike wound&quot; in group PvP, but keeping up the debuff is too difficult with a cast time. <br>
<br>
Hunters getting a Mortal Strike spell for 11 talent points<br>
They got 11-point Mortal Strike sometime ago. Rogues have it baseline, but its a poison that can be dispelled. The Hunter variant is a ranged ability, which is hard to keep up if they are out of line of sight. They all have their benefits and drawbacks. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/10529923337-gc-hunters-get-11-point-mortal-strike.html))<br>
<br>
Pet health<br>
We still are working on bumping the base health of the pets up. <br>
<br>
Trap Mastery and and Explosive Shot linked in the future ?<br>
It won&apos;t be, no worries~ (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10532273525-please-unlink-trap-mastery-and-explosive-shot.html))<br>
<br>
Lock and Load bugged<br>
It isn&apos;t 100%, its more around 2/4/6% on periodic damage from Serpent Sting. Its proc chance is in the ballpark of Shadow Trance (Nightfall) for Warlocks, though 2% higher (since Nightfall is 4%). Seems like a tooltip bug.<br>
<br>
Edit: Nm, seems like its really bugged. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10043094197-lock-and-load-changes-what-am-i-missing.html))<br>

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/paladin.jpg Paladin (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=610) / Talent Calc. (8982) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br>
Paladin / Hybrid DPS in WotLK<br>
Ret should be as close to the top as anyone else. Our buckets at this point are basically DPS, Tanks, Healers. When the tank and healer are doing dps, it&apos;s even closer. You may be a couple hundred dps lower than a pure dps class (hunter, mage, warlock, rogue) but for most players, the numbers will be close enough that a raid with a good Retadin and an okay rogue will see Ret on top.<br>
<br>
This is a change in philosophy from the BC era, where we would engineer hybrid classes to be 25% to 30% and sometimes much lower than dps classes.<br>
<br>
If there are dps differences, it&apos;s going to take a very, very skilled guild to be able to accuately decipher them. That is because a boss is not a training dummy. For almost all of us, it&apos;s going to be impossible to tell whether the rogue doing 2500 dps and the paladin doing 2300 dps is because of the class or the player. And it is likely to be a different number on the very next boss.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re trying to hedge out bets and NOT promise that every class will do 2500 dps in all cases, because that just won&apos;t happen. There are too many other variables. But you won&apos;t be far below other classes... as you often were in BC and Classic WoW.<br>
<br>
Again, this is a goal. If a month after we ship someone discovers that the best way to play a mage is to get some obscure combination of trinket, set bonus, enchant and flask that allows them to do 3500 dps at no mana cost, well that&apos;s clearly not the kind of thing we expected to see and we&apos;ll take steps to adjust it. We have a lot of clever players though, and it&apos;s going to take some time before everything has been fully explored.

Prayer of Mending bugs<br>
It should be using the Priests spell power, not the targets. As for the threat, it should now generate threat for the Priest not the target. The same was done to Lifebloom, Earth Shield, etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/10544534418-suggestion-pw-shield-and-rage-generation.html))<br>
<br>
Shadow damage nerf and Twisted Faith<br>
Players are being too reactionary to recent balance changes. I certainly understand the will to be as powerful as you can be, and nobody likes seeing their damage reduced, but there is a method to the madness. This is just the ebb and flow of DPS testing and modifications to those tests. If it turns out Shadow Priests are underperforming, have faith we&apos;ll address that.<br>
<br>
As for Twisted Faith*, it increases damage if the target has Shadow Word: Pain not &quot;mind flay&quot; already on it. That&apos;s a typo. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/10539063807-please-just-stop-the-whining.html))<br>

Riptide<br>
We have a lot of work to do still on Riptide. We still think the niche is good, but the numbers don&apos;t feel right yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/10532593601-to-the-almighty-gc.html))<br>
<br>
Enhancement shamans / UR changes<br>
I can say that we aren&apos;t thrilled about seeing Enhancement shammies in caster gear, with two fast weapons and dual FTs. We have some ideas that will shift Enhancement back to caring about AP more, while still letting you do a lot of spell damage, because that&apos;s a cool part of the class. I predict that WF / FT will be more popular, but you never know. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/10529924081-devs-planintent-for-enhancement.html))<br>
<br>
If I didn&apos;t mention it before, UR should be affecting ranged attack power too. We&apos;ll get that fixed. <br>
<br>
Windfury Bugs<br>
I almost hate to mention this for fear I will be proven wrong, but we think we fixed the bugs with WF and they should be available next patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/10529923632-sorry-gc-but-important-question.html))<br>
<br>
Lightning Bolt nerf in WotLK / Elemental spec damage boost<br>
The reason Lightning Bolt probably feels weak to you (which I gather is the problem, though many of these posts aren&apos;t at all easy to read) is because it benefits from a lot of buffs that didn&apos;t used to benefit it. The old Curse of Shadows is but one example. We designed the numbers for LB to do some pretty decent damage when raid buffed, and lowered some of the base number accordingly so that it wouldn&apos;t be insane when fully buffed. But we started to realize Elementals were going to log into 3.0, even before Northrend, and see LB damage way down. That feels pretty cruddy. So we&apos;re talking about ways to get the damage back up there to where it feels decent in small groups or solo. <br>
<br>
The good news is that overall, Elemental damage was low. That&apos;s going to give us a lot of room for Balance-like damage buffs. I&apos;m not saying we&apos;re going to handle it the same way, but you should see it go up noticeably in a patch or two. Cool? <br>
<br>
[...] I didn&apos;t mean to imply that your dps will suck unless you&apos;re raid-buffed. Everyone should be in a similar boat. You will see your dps go up a lot when in a large group -- that&apos;s part of the charm of seeing what happens when everyone combines their efforts. But shamans in general and Elemental in particular isn&apos;t designed to be crappy unless with friends.

Affliction tree<br>
Haunt - It should be more than 20%. Haven&apos;t settled on the right number yet. Should be &quot;coming back&quot; when you apply a new Haunt or when the effect ends, will check on that.<br>
Pandemic - I&apos;m not sure it works the way you&apos;re describing, are you sure it rolls twice? I&apos;ll check tomorrow.<br>
Shadow Embrace - Not sure I buy that, Haunt has a 10 second cooldown, the duration lasts 12 sec. Suppose we could put Drain Life on this. You aren&apos;t really intended to just AOE MS.<br>
Everlasting Affliction - The philosophy is that Shadow Priests and Affliction Warlocks have harsher DPS rotations than most classes, so we chilled those out and gave the classes who had little to no rotations a rotation. You can still ignore this talent and go crazy with your rotation if you wish =) <br>
<br>
Haunt still doesn&apos;t heal<br>

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/warrior.jpg Warrior (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=600) / Talent Calc. (8982) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warrior))<br>
Developper Q&amp;A (Full version (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/10043282292-crunch-time-simple-but-vital-questions.html))<br>
Why does bladestorm have a self-CC element? Why doesn&apos;t it remove CC, stuns, snares or roots on use? Will this be reconsidered? <br>
It does great dps. It would be too good if you could do other stuff too and too good if you could Intercept someone down. We might reconsider the CC issue, but really that&apos;s the kind of thing to pop out of PvP testing. <br>
<br>
Are there any plans to make the improved charge and improved heroic strike talents not bad? Less bad? <br>
We buffed Imp Charge recently. Imp Heroic Strike might seem a little bland, but that may be because we&apos;ve changed a lot of the old talents in various trees that used to do simple things like this. Heroic really does hit like a truck now, so I assume your issue is what the talent does to rage cost? <br>
<br>
Why was enrage&apos;s bonus damage reduced so severely? Would you consider allowing deathwish to stack again now that the bonus is so low? <br>
Because we changed it from &quot;be crit&quot; to &quot;be hurt.&quot; We might consider letting it stack. <br>
<br>
Have you looked at the math supplied by Torgal and company that demonstrates titans grip isn&apos;t such a massive increase as you think it is? If their numbers are correct, then what is your stance?<br>
Our numbers say differently. I haven&apos;t looked to see where they differ. I&apos;ll try to get to that.<br>
<br>
You say you don&apos;t want any single talent point giving a 10% damage increase (as for example.) On 25-man Kel&apos;thuzad and Sapphiron last night, mortal strike amounted to approximately 17% of my total damage done. On Sapphiron, slam was approximately 40% of total damage. Will mortal strike, bloodthirst or improved slam be nerfed based on your talent budgeting?<br>
No. That&apos;s not a hard and fast rule. In your example though, if you had not used Mortal Strike or Slam you probably would have used the rage for something else. In the case of TG though we do have serious concerns about it being too good (sans a stiff penalty). While we might change our minds after more data, you&apos;re not going to change our mind by pointing out logical inconsistencies in talent trees. There are plenty of them.<br>
<br>
Do you see the glyph of resonating power (Increases the maximum targets affected by your Thunder Clap ability by 4) as being mandatory for tanking? If yes, do you feel that&apos;s acceptable? If no, why not? <br>
It&apos;s not mandatory, and actually it only increases your radius. Thunder Clap will do what you want it to do, but that&apos;s another topic.<br>
<br>
Can you offer an approximation of the proc rate/PPM on furious attacks? <br>
It&apos;s a frequency-based proc. It&apos;s a little complicated to explain but you might compare it to Omen of Clarity. I&apos;ll try to get back to this later. <br>
<br>
Are there any plans to make unending fury not bad? Less bad? Seriously, it&apos;s really really bad. <br>
Yeah, this one doesn&apos;t feel done. <br>
<br>
Damage shield is, according to some very basic testing, not generating threat from damage dealt. Can you confirm this? If so, is this intended? <br>
It appears to generate threat based on the damage done. But there might be a bug. <br>
<br>
Are there any plans to buff revenge baseline so that it&apos;s worth injecting into rotations for protection? <br>
Putting it into Sword and Board is something we are discussing. <br>
<br>
Do you feel that shockwave is, or should be, our be-all answer to AoE threat generation? Is there any chance of lowering the cooldown? <br>
No, we don&apos;t want it to be your go-to AE ability, because then Arms and Fury can never tank a 5-player dungeon very well. We want it to be useful obviously. <br>
<br>
Is it possible to give Disarm the same functionality as rogue&apos;s Dismantle, or at least, the removed Shield Break skill?<br>
I&apos;ll have to investigate this. <br>
<br>
Do you feel heroic throw is strong or interesting enough for a level 80 skill? <br>
Yes. <br>
<br>
The devs seem to have originally planned several means for warriors to interact with the new enrage mechanics. Will enraged regeneration and the rend bonus be all that we see for the expansion, or is more being considered? Specifically, enraged assault.<br>
The problem we had with Enraged Assault was our warrior testers and designers didn&apos;t feel like they had enough GCDs to work another attack into their rotations. It was just too much. I love the idea though (it wasn&apos;t mine) so I wouldn&apos;t say never. <br>
<br>
While you&apos;re doing numbers passes, any chance of restoring flurry to its original 30% bonus? Compare it to shamans flurry and it&apos;s clearly underbudgeted.<br>
It all depends at this point on whether shamans or warriors are doing too much damage. <br>
<br>
Why was the healing component of bloodthirst nerfed? <br>
We thought it was too good, though to be honest, there are clandestine whispers echoing through our offices in the dead of night to change it back. <br>

Also is it intended for protection warriors to be in the 1.3 1.4k dps ballpark when prot DKs, pallies or bears do a lot more damage? <br>
No, that is too low. We nerfed Devastate (for good reason) and haven&apos;t given warriors anything back yet. We don&apos;t want to just buff Revenge, because that doesn&apos;t help dps when you aren&apos;t the tank. Shield Slam is a good candidate. <br>
<br>
And it *is* the intention for Arms and Fury to do damage that is very close to other dps specs. I can&apos;t say 100%, because I feel the need to always caveat this. :) You may be tops on one fight, but the very next fight may work so differently that you aren&apos;t on top. Overall it should be really hard to tell whether it&apos;s the player or the class that is driving those numbers. <br>
<br>
To what extent is the warrior community&apos;s perception that the developers deliberately design warriors to be weaker than other classes at low or &quot;casual&quot; gear levels in exchange for being powerful at higher gear levels correct? <br>
We worry a lot more about class balance at max level. We do try and make sure people have the tools they need to level up, but we don&apos;t spend a lot of our time making sure rogues and warriors do similar dps at level 76. I don&apos;t think warriors are unique here. We *have* been burned before by warriors ending up a lot more powerful with good gear than we anticipated. Warriors have a tendency to be rage-starved and do low dps and then suddenly hit some magic threshold of gear and have plenty of rage, which means more dps, which means more rage.... It may have been our referencing that phenomenon that has driven that perception. But we don&apos;t go out of our way to compensate for that by nerfing warriors in greens or heroic blues. <br>

Protection talent tree<br>
Your solution gets us to pretty much the same place but with higher dps. We don&apos;t want to inflate every class to doing e.g. 4000 dps in the first raid of LK or we&apos;re going to be in crazy land by Icecrown. Rather than buff everything to Devastate&apos;s level, we brought it down. Prot needs to use Revenge more, agreed, but if Prot warriors can get more dps and therefore threat out of spamming Devastate, they are going to do that unless rage starved. Devastate works better when it&apos;s the third choice after SS and Revenge. (The crit chance was also too high. That would have started doing weird things to Prot as well.) The fact that dps warriors were looking at Devastate as a way to increase their dps, was just icing on the cake.<br>
<br>
We are going to buff Shield Slam&apos;s damage (but probably it&apos;s flat damage because it scales very well already) to make sure it remains the go-to ability for Prot, even when not tanking. We will probably add Revenge to S+B to make sure it gets used more (and might buff it&apos;s AP coefficient a tad). I think those changes will leave Prot in a better place.

Arms talent tree feedback<br>
This thread is a little bit different from some of the others I&apos;ve started, because I&apos;m going to povide a little more direction on a few specific talents. This is a discussion of ARMS however. Also note that we want the tree to be both PvE and PvP viable so keep that in mind when responding.<br>
<br>
First, we&apos;re not dramatically overhauling warrior stances. At least not now. We have talked about it quite a bit, and it&apos;s something we might do in the future, but it does require a lot discussion. So we aren&apos;t taking away the penalties and we aren&apos;t adding a bonus to Arms for now. However, if there are less dramatic changes that totally &quot;fix&quot; Battle Stance for you, feel free to mention those. An example might be putting Pummel into Arms (perhaps with a talent).<br>
<br>
Second, Bladestorm. Currently it allows you to use white attacks and we&apos;re inclined to leave it that way. It can do an awful lot of damage right now, so I hope your feedback isn&apos;t that it doesn&apos;t hit hard enough. I know several people want it to break fear instead of just prevent it.<br>
<br>
Third, Sudden Death. Some people love it because it&apos;s actually a decision when it lights up. Other people hate it for the same reason.<br>
<br>
Fourth, Wrecking Crew. This is pretty much just a discussion of the Enrage mechanic, unless you just think the numbers are off or something. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=10538134777&amp;sid=2000))</div></div>
