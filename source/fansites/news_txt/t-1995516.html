Legion - Action Camera<br>
Legion added a new camera feature with that changes the camera to focus on your target rather than always being centered on the player. <br>
<br>
<br>
Nameplates - Set nameplates to the normal position or under the character<br>
Head Movement - Heavy, normal, low, and no head movement<br>
Target Focus - Focus the camera on your target or the player.<br>

Legion Beta - NPC Phasing<br>
As many have confirmed, this isn&apos;t localized to Dalaran (although there&apos;s likely many different ways this is breaking, it&apos;s not so much a single global issue).<br>
<br>
We&apos;re continuing to work on this today; as our engineers find things to improve, they push out code changes, and either restart the servers completely (like with a 15 minute countdown to restart) or just instantly crash and restart all the instance of Dalaran running (which is more instant).<br>
<br>
This is our #1 issue on the Beta at the moment - we know it&apos;s impacting your ability to test the game in virtually all other avenues. Thanks for being patient while we work through it.<br>

Legion World Quests<br>
Level 1 and 2 WANTED quests have been tuned down significantly, please give them another shot and let us know what you think.<br>
<br>
Level 3 WANTED quests (currently) retain their high level of difficulty, blue icon, and extra-high chance to drop good loot.

Proving Grounds<br>
Are proving grounds still going to be a requirement in Legion?<br>
No. The emergence of Mythic dungeons, requiring premade groups, removes the need. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/727574452418936832))<br>
Just to clarify, you won&apos;t need/have Proving grounds to queue for Heroic dungeons in #Legion ?<br>
Correct. Proving Grounds still exist, but PG Silver won&#x2019;t gate Heroic dungeons. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/727629756095586304))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Thoughts on Blizzards response to legacy servers? Did you expect it? Would you find any interest in pristine servers? Thanks!<br>
Good on JAB for saying something publicly. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/725022310474739712))<br>
<br>
Tell me honestly, do Blizz really not have the code for old versions of WoW? Odd for a software company to not have backups.<br>
I&apos;m sure they do, but I don&apos;t think the idea of data security is that you restore to a 10 year old version. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/725319282985291776))<br>
I mean think about how much things like OS and server hardware has changed in 10 years. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/725319401910624256))<br>
Could they make it work? Probably. Would it be an extraordinary effort? Probably. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/725319510954102784))<br>
<br>
One of the hardest lessons in Game Design is knowing when it&apos;s appropriate to not give the player what they want.<br>
So long as you can empathize with why they want it and not come across as if you know better than them. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/725844381790396416))<br>
Man the hilarity of you guys&apos; tweets really never gets old. You have no clue what players want at all.<br>
Players almost never want the same thing. That&apos;s what makes this job both hard and fun. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/726097986535591936))<br>
