<br>
Patch 8.1 Hotfixes - January 22, 2019<br>
Dungeons and Raids<br>
<br>
Fortified (https://www.wowdb.com/affixes/10-fortified) and Bolster (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/209859-bolster) will no longer increase the health of the Reaping ghosts.<br>
The MOTHERLODE!!<br>
<br>
Fixed an issue causing Venture Co. Earthshapers to count double towards Enemy Forces criteria on Mythic Keystone difficulties. Slightly reduced the total Enemy Forces count.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Potions that grant the player Invisibility (such as Demitri&apos;s Draught of Deception) now place a 5-minute cooldown on all other potion types (was 10 minutes). The shared cooldown time for invisibility potions remains 10 minutes.<br>
Fixed a bug that prevented Tome of Town Portal (https://www.wowdb.com/items/142542-tome-of-town-portal) from being properly affected by Seafarer&#x2019;s Hearth (https://www.wowdb.com/garrison/talents/547-seafarers-hearth).<br>
<br>
<br>
Player versus Player<br>
<br>
Every portion of Azerite powers that scale with item level have been reduced by 50% in PvP.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: With the advent of new five-ring Azerite armor in Season 2, we&#x2019;re mindful of the increased potential for stacking and combining traits. Over the course of BfA we&#x2019;ve also made adjustments to individual Azerite traits, but that creates uncertainty and unpredictability, where unless you&#x2019;ve followed all our hotfixes you don&#x2019;t know exactly how a given trait will change when you enter PvP. This aims to replace that uncertainty with a straightforward rule. This change also overwrites all previous reductions to Azerite Traits in PvP that occurred during Season 1, as they will all now have their reduction set to 50% effectiveness. Non-scaling and non-stacking effects are unaffected by this adjustment.<br>
<br>
Resolved an issue that caused Sinister Gladiator&apos;s Maledict to not strike enemy players who have moved out of line of sight after the initial activation of the trinket.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quests<br>
<br>
Players on &quot;The Lord Admiral&apos;s Lament (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/53128-the-lord-admirals-lament)&quot; while on the Saurfang questline should now be able to see Isabella.<br>
&#x201C;Quartermaster&apos;s Bounty (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/53457-quartermasters-bounty)&#x201D;, in which you turn in 10 Quartermaster&apos;s Coins to get a Battleborn Sigil, is now a weekly repeatable quest.</div></div>
