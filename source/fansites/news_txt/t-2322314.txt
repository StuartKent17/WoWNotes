Beta Build Version Number Update
This afternoon the beta version of World of Warcraft was updated to Patch 8.0.0 - Build 25338. There is no data or actual patch, this is just a version number that is mentioned on the patch server. It is likely related to getting a build of the game ready for BlizzCon.
