Warlords of Draenor Alpha Patch Notes Update - May 23
You can find a full version of the notes with more context on the Blue Post Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/315561-warlords-of-draenor-alpha-patch-notes-05-23-2014/.
Introduction
Welcome to an early look at patch notes for the upcoming World of Warcraft expansion: Warlords of Draenor. The new expansion introduces a wealth of new content and changes. There's also a new patch note format, which we hope will help better convey the reasoning for many of the changes being made and what they mean for you, while providing more background into issues we're trying to solve.

Please be aware that the Alpha patch notes are preliminary and not final. Details may change before retail release and new information will be added for additional features as development continues on the Warlords of Draenor expansion. Note: Not all the content listed may be available for immediate testing or may only be available during a limited testing window during the Alpha.


New secondary stats: Bonus Armor, Multistrike, and Readiness.


Primary Character Stats and Attack Power

Weapon Damage values on all weapons have been reduced by 50%.


Itemization Changes
General

New secondary stats added:

Multistrike http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-multistrike-val=0&filter-multistrike-op=1: Grants a chance for spells and abilities to fire up to 2 additional times, at 30% effectiveness both damage and healing.
Readiness http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-readiness-val=0&filter-readiness-op=1: Reduces the cooldown on several abilities with long-cooldowns for the class. The tooltip for Readiness displays a list of affected abilities.



Ability Pruning
What abilities and spells got cut is a very, very difficult question to answer. Every ability is vital to someone, so we don't take this process lightly. We hope that even if we cut your favorite ability, you can see it in the context of our larger goals. It's important to remember that the point of these changes is to increase players' ability to understand the game, not to reduce depth of gameplay.

Berserker Rage http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/18499 no longer Enrage http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/13046 the Warrior, generates Rage or increases Physical damage dealt. It now functions to break and provide immunity from Fear http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5782, Incapacitates, and Sap http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/6770.
Mortal Strike http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/12294 now replaces Heroic Strike http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78 for Arms Warriors.
Overpower http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/7384 has been removed.


Crowd Control and Diminishing Returns
Another big takeaway from Mists of Pandaria is that there was simply too much crowd control CC in the game. To solve that, we knew that we needed an across-the-board disarmament. Here's a summary of the player-cast CC changes:


Paladin

Repentance http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/20066 cast time has been increased to 1.7 seconds.
Turn Evil http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/10326 cast time has been increased to 1.7 seconds and now has a 6-second duration in PvP down from 8 seconds.



Buffs and Debuffs
Weakened Armor and Physical Vulnerability were effectively redundant, both filling the role of increasing Physical damage taken by the target. We removed Weakened Armor and widened the availability of Physical Vulnerability and increased its effectiveness slightly.


Weakened Armor and Physical Vulnerability

Physical Vulnerability increases physical damage taken by 5% up from 4%.
The following abilities no longer apply the Weakened Armor effect.

Druid: Faerie Fire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/770 now applies Physical Vulnerability, increasing Physical damage taken by 5% for 30 seconds.



Raid Utility Balance

Hunter

A minor Raid utility ability to-be-determined will be added for Hunters.


Mage

Amplify Magic http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/159916-amplify-magic is a new spell available to Mages.

Amplify Magic amplifies the effects of helpful magic, increasing all healing received by 12% for all party and raid members within 100 yards, and lasts 6 seconds with a 2-minute cooldown.




Tank Vengeance and Resolve
To keep tank DPS meaningful, we'll be raising their damage, since it would be meager with no Vengeance Attack Power Vengeance accounted for 70-90% of a tank's damage on high-tank-damage fights in Mists. To do that, we're increasing the damage of several prominent tank abilities, as well as having tanks also gain increased Attack Power from Mastery and Bonus Armor, in addition to the statâ€™s existing benefits. For plate-wearing Tank specializations, Riposte has been redesigned to convert Critical Strike into Parry, a defensive stat. That also helps keep secondary stats balanced in offensive value for them.


General

Riposte is a passive ability for Blood Death Knights, Protection Paladins, and Protection warriors.

Riposte now gives the character Parry equal to their Critical Strike bonus from gear.





Class Changes

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight 

Heart Strike http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/55050 damage has been increased by 30%, but no longer deals additional damage for each disease present on the target.
Heart Strike http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/55050 has been removed. Blood Death Knights should use Pestilence http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/50842 in its place.



http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid
The maximum number of charges that can be accumulated for Savage Defense has been reduced to make its uptime more consistent between short and long periods of tanking. 


Ursa Major is a new passive ability for Guardian Druids.

Ursa Major: Multistrikes from auto attacks, Lacerate http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/33745 periodic damage, and Mangle http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/33878 grants the Druid the Ursa Major effect. Ursa Major increases maximum health by 2% for 30 seconds. When the effect is refreshed, the remaining portion is added to the new effect.

Lacerate http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/33745 now generates 5 Rage, has no cooldown down from a 3-second cooldown, and the periodic bleed effect triggers every 1 second down from 3 seconds. but no longer has a chance to reset Mangle http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/33878 cooldown.
Savage Defense http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/62606 can now accumulate 2 charges down from 3 charges.
Glyph of Savagery http://beta.wowdb.com/items/40923 has been renamed Glyph of Savage Roar http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/52610, and now grants a free 5 Combo Point Savage Roar http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/52610 when leaving Prowl http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/102547, instead of allowing Savage Roar http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/52610 to be used with 0 Combo Points.


We have some extensive changes for Balance Druids. One of our guiding principles with game design is that things should be "easy to learn, hard to master". We're not particularly happy with the Moonkin rotation because it was actually hard to learn, and easy to master especially with regards to periodic damage effects no longer snapshotting. Energy and Eclipse mechanics were not intuitive for many newer players. Once you became accustomed to the rotation, there wasnâ€™t much additional depth to mastering it; maintain two DoTs, hit these other two buttons whenever they light up, and spam one of two buttons in between. In order to try to make it easier to learn, but also add some gameplay depth and challenge we're making a significant revision to the rotation. The list of changes is quite dense, so hereâ€™s a summary of the changes.

Summary of changes to Balance:

Balance Energy is a bar that automatically cycles back and forth between Lunar and Solar sides, like night and day. The closer to one end that the bar is, the more damage that side's spells do.
Balance Druids now have four rotational spells.

Starfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/2912: Lunar direct damage spell

Cast when the Lunar side is stronger

Wrath http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5176: Solar direct damage spell

Cast when the Solar side is stronger

Moonfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921: Lunar periodic damage spell. While closer to Solar, this button is replaced with Sunfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402, a Solar periodic damage spell.

Maintain both effects where possible

Starsurge http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78674: Direct damage spell that benefits from whichever side is stronger. Has up to 3 charges, and buffs the damage of the next few Wrath http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5176 or Starfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/2912.

Cast when able to follow up with a few strong Wrath http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5176 or Starfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/2912.




That's the basics of the new Moonkin rotation. Thereâ€™s room for improvement beyond that, learning to optimally maintain both periodic damage effects with the strongest Eclipse effect, timing Starsurges to optimize the benefit of its buff, make use of Starfall and Hurricane for area damage, and taking advantage of the strengths of each side such as Moonfire and Sunfire having significant differences now. Here are the full details of the changes.


Balance Energy system has been redesigned. Balance Energy is a bar that cycles back and forth between Lunar and Solar sides, like night and day, with a 30 second cycle time from Lunar to Solar and back to Lunar.

Balance Energy is no longer generated through spells, talents, or other effects anymore.

Eclipse http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/79577 has been redesigned.

Eclipse http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/79577 inspires the Druid with the power of the moon and the sun, causing the damage of Lunar and Solar spells to be increased by up to 30% based on how close Balance Energy levels are to the appropriate side.

Example: With 0 Balance Energy, the damage bonus is evenly split between Lunar and Solar, and the Druid receives a 15% increase to damage for both spell types. With 80 Solar Energy, the Druid receives a 27% damage increase to Solar spells and a 3% damage increase to Lunar spells.

Mastery: Total Eclipse http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/77492 now increases the maximum damage bonus of Eclipse http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/79577 by 12% increasing with Mastery.

Starfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/2912 now has a 3 second cast time up from 2.7 seconds.
Moonfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921 now has a 16 second base duration up from 14 seconds, but is no longer extended by Starfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/2912 and Starsurge http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78674 critical strikes.
Sunfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402 now has a 16 second duration up from 14 seconds, but is no longer extended by Wrath http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5176 and Starsurge http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78674 critical strikes. Additionally, Sunfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402 is no longer its own spell. Sunfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402 replaces Moonfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921 on the action bar whenever Balance Energy is on the Solar side. Enemies may still suffer from both Moonfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921 and Sunfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402â€™s periodic damage components simultaneously.
Lunar Shower http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/33605 has been redesigned and renamed Astral Showers.

Astral Showers calls upon greater Lunar and Solar energy to permanently empower the Druid's Moonfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921 and Sunfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402 spells.

Moonfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921 initial damage is increased by 100%, and the duration of its periodic damage effect is increased by 100%.
Sunfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402 initial damage is increased by 100%, and its periodic damage effect is now applied to all enemies within 5 yards of the target.


Starsurge http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78674 now has 3 charges and a 30 second recharge time instead of a 15 second cooldown. Starsurge http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78674 now also grants Lunar or Solar Empowerment.

Lunar Empowerment causes the next 2 Starfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/2912 to deal 30% more damage.
Solar Empowerment causes the next 3 Wrath http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5176 to deal 30% more damage.

Starfall http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/48505 now shares charges with Starsurge http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78674, and has no cooldown of its own. It also now hits all nearby enemies up from 2 nearby enemies.
Shooting Stars http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93399 now adds 1 full charge of Starsurge http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78674 and Starfall http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/48505 when it triggers, and now has a 2.5% chance to trigger on Moonfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921 and Sunfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402 periodic damage. This chance is doubled on critical strikes.
Hurricane http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/42231 range has been increased to 35 yards up from 30 yards.
Astral Storm http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/106998 has been removed.
Wild Mushroom http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/88747 Balance now begins snaring enemies immediately when summoned, lasts 20 seconds, and can no longer be detonated to deal damage.

Wild Mushroom: Detonate http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78777 has been removed.

Celestial Alignment http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/112071 has been redesigned.

Celestial Alignment http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/112071 causes the Druid to enter Celestial Alignment http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/112071, a state where Balance Energy cycle is paused, and all Lunar and Solar spells benefit from the maximum Eclipse http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/79577 bonus. Lasts 15 seconds with a 3 minute cooldown.

Astral Communion http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/127663 now increases the rate that Balance Energy cycles by 300% while channeled.
Euphoria http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/81062 has been removed.
Insect Swarm has been redesigned and renamed Stellar Flare http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/1543.

Stellar Flare http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/1543 is a powerful spell benefitting from both Lunar and Solar Eclipse http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/79577, dealing the most damage when they are equal. Burns the target for Spellstorm damage and cause additional damage over 15 seconds. The ability has a cast time of 1.5 seconds.

Soul of the Forest http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/114107 Balance has been redesigned.

Soul of the Forest http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/114107 Balance now increases the damage bonus from Lunar and Solar Empowerment by an additional 30%.

Equinox has been replaced with a new talent, Balance of Power http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/33596.

Balance of Power http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/33596 causes Wrath http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5176 to extend the duration of Sunfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402 by 4 seconds and Starfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/2912 to extend the duration of Moonfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921 by 6 seconds.

Sunfall has been replaced with a new talent, Euphoria http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/81062.

Euphoria http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/81062 grants the Druid a deeper connection to the stars, causing Balance Energy to cycle 50% faster. Additionally, Starsurge http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78674 also grants 20% Haste for 6 seconds.

Several Glyphs and Draenor Perks will be redesigned in a future build, and so are currently TBD.

Glyph of Omens
Glyph of Sudden Eclipse
Empowered Starfall
Enhanced Mushrooms
Enhanced Starsurge
Enhanced Storms



Omen of Clarity http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/113043 got changed to not trigger more often with Tree of Life; it was too strong in our new healing model. Soul of the Forest http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/114107 was also redesigned for Restoration and Genesis to fit better with the new design for periodic effects.


Genesis has been redesigned.

Genesis now consumes all of the Druid's Rejuvenation http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/774 effects on party or raid members within 60 yards and applies the Genesis effect to them instead. Genesis heals the target for an amount equal to the remaining healing from the consumed Rejuvenation http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/774 effects over 3 seconds. Healing from Genesis counts toward Wild Mushroom http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/88747 as if it was from Rejuvenation http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/774.

Omen of Clarity http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/113043 Restoration can now only be triggered by the most recently applied Lifebloom http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/94447.
Soul of the Forest http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/114107 for Restoration Druids has been redesigned.

Soul of the Forest http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/114107 Restoration when casting Swiftmend http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/18562, the Druid gains Soul of the Forest http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/114107. Soul of the Forest http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/114107 reduces the cast time of the next Healing Touch http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5185 by 50%, or increases the healing of the next Regrowth http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8936, Rejuvenation http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/774, or Wild Growth http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/48438 by 100%.



The level 90-Talent row for Druids was designed to encourage hybrid gameplay. We decided that, while you shouldn't have to give up a significant amount of your primary role throughput in order to gain the off-role benefit, you also don't need to gain an actual benefit to your primary role throughput benefit either. We've reduced the power of their primary role benefit, making them roughly neutral in their effect on your primary role. Note that the increase to off-role healing from Nature's Vigil is not actually a buff see Healing and Player Health above.


Dream of Cenarius http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/108373

Feral: Increases the healing of Healing Touch http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5185 and Rejuvenation http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/774 by 20%, and causes them to also heal the Druid when cast on allies. Casting Healing Touch http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5185 no longer increases the damage of the Druidâ€™s next 2 melee abilities, or increases the healing of Rejuvenation http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/774.




http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter
Each Hunter specialization received a revision to the burst-damage-cooldowns they have access to. All specializations now have one burst-damage-cooldown available baseline, and can add to that through talent choices.

Beast Mastery Hunters retain Bestial Wrath. Rapid Fire is a good fit for Marksmanship, and we improved it. For Survival, we wanted to both increase the prominence of their traps, and give them a new damage cooldown. So, a new trap called Bear Trap has been created to fit that role. Note that Bear Trap's base cooldown can be reduced by other passive abilities and perks, such that it has roughly a 2 minute-cooldown afterwards.


Bear Trap is a new ability for Survival Hunters.

Bear Trap places a trap with duration of 1 minute that immobilizes the first enemy that triggers it for 8 seconds and deals heavy bleed damage over 20 seconds. Damage from other sources may break the immobilization effect. The ability has a 4 minute cooldown.

Careful Aim http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/34483 now also provides its effect against all targets when Rapid Fire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/3045 is active.


There were also a few other changes, primarily for quality of life and rotational consistency.

Aimed Shot http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/19434 now deals 20% more damage, no longer interrupts Auto Attacks, and can be cast while moving.



http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage 
We decided to merge the 3 current Bomb Talents into one that changes based on spec. That allows us to reintroduce spec-specific perks to each Bomb, and makes room for some non-DoT alternatives.


Nether Tempest http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/114923 can now only be on 1 target at a time down from unlimited, but its secondary damage now hits all targets in range up from only 1, deals 100% of the primary damage up from 50%, and its damage is now increased by Arcane Charge http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/114664.
Unstable Magic is a new Talent available at level 75, in the middle Talent slot.

Unstable Magic: Arcane Blast http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/30451, Fireball http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/133, and Frostbolt http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/116 have a 25% chance to explode on impact, dealing an additional 50% damage to the target, and all other enemies within 8 yards.



Frost Mages enjoyed newfound PvE viability in Mists of Pandaria, and we intend to continue that into the future. However, we do want to clean up some rough spots, especially around their valuing of secondary stats, and the amount of instant-cast spells in their rotation. The Frost Armor and Shatter changes increase the amount of Haste/Critical chance that they can acquire on gear before they start hitting soft caps. The Shatter change also lowers the value of Critical Strike for a bit. The changes to the level-75 Talent row meant that having a Bomb spell is no longer guaranteed, so we changed the way that Brain Freeze is triggered. We also changed Brain Freeze's effect, in order to give Frost mages another cast-time spell in their rotation.


Frost Armor http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/7302 now grants an 8% chance to Multistrike instead of 7% Haste.
The Brain Freeze http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/44549 effect now increases no longer makes Frostfire Bolt http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/44614 damage by 25%, and instant, but it can now stack up to 2 times. It also no longer triggers from the Bomb Talents, and instead has a 10% chance to trigger from Frostbolt http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/116 casts. Each Multistrike of Frostbolt http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/116 increases that cast's chance by an additional 45%. Total of 100% on double-Multistrikes.
Glyph of Icy Veins http://beta.wowdb.com/items/42753 now causes Icy Veins http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/12472 to provide 35% chance to Multistrike, instead of 20% Haste.


Rotation for Fire Mage is looking solid with the new Draenor Perks. However, their cooldown strength could use a buff.

Combustion http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/11129 damage has been increased by 100%.



http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk

Soothing Mist http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/115175 healing has been increased by 100%, its GCD has been reduced to 0.5 seconds, but no longer heals immediately, and no longer generates Chi. for Mistweaver Monks.
Summon Jade Serpent Statue http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/115313 now has a 10-second cooldown down from 30 seconds.
Thunder Focus Tea http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/116680 no longer costs Chi, causes the next Renewing Mist http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/115151 to jump up to 4 times used to cause instead of causing the next Uplift http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/116670 to refresh the duration of Renewing Mist http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/115151 on all targets. Its effect on Surging Mist http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/116995 remains unchanged.


To better balance the damage of Brewmaster versus Windwalker where both share many of the same abilities, we removed the damage increase provided by Tiger Stance, and increased the damage of melee abilities to compensate.


Stance of the Fierce Tiger http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/103985 no longer increases damage dealt.
Tiger Strikes http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/120272 is now available to all Monk specializations, and has a chance to trigger on successful auto attacks and their Multistrikes. It has an 8% chance to trigger while using a two-handed weapon, and a 5% chance to trigger while dual wielding.

When triggered, Tiger Strikes http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/120272 now grants a 25% increase to Multistrike for 8 seconds instead of a 50% increase to attack speed and double attacks for 4 attacks.



For Brewmasters, Gift of the Ox has been modified to allow it to scale defensively with the new Multistrike stat. The Black Ox Statue has been modified to aid Monks in establishing aggro on new enemies instead of shielding allies. We also removed the Misfire effect, as it did not live up to its original idea, and was unnecessary.

Black Ox Statue no longer casts Guard http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/115295 on allies and now has a 10-second cooldown down from 30 seconds. Black Ox Statue now passively attracts the attention of all enemies within 30 yards, causing a minor amount of threat each second.
Dizzying Haze http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/115180 no longer causes the target's melee attacks to sometimes misfire.

Avenging Wrath http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/31884 now also increases all of the Paladinâ€™s healing by 20% for its duration.


We wanted to improve Seal gameplay for Protection and Retribution, so have made a few changes in that regard. Protection had three Seals, but only used Insight due to its defensive value. Weâ€™ve moved that defensive value into a passive for Protection Paladins, and expect them to primarily use a mixture of Seal of Truth and Seal of Righteousness now. To provide better gameplay between Seal of Truth and Seal of Righteousness, and effectively remove a button, we made Seal of Righteousness transform Crusader Strike into Hammer of the Righteous.


Inner Light is a new passive ability for Protection Paladins and provides a chance for each melee attack to heal the Paladin.

Glyph of the Battle Healer http://beta.wowdb.com/items/81956 is now available only for Protection Paladins, and affects healing from Inner Light instead of Seal of Insight http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/20165.

Crusader Strike http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/35395 and Hammer of the Righteous http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/115801 are no longer separate spells.

Seal of Righteousness http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/20154 now also causes Crusader Strike http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/35395 to be replaced with Hammer of the Righteous http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/115801 while active.

Seal of Insight http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/20165 no longer gives melee attacks a chance to heal the Paladin.



http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest
For Holy Priests, our biggest concern is with the Chakras. We think that Chakras are the defining abilities of Holy Priests, but that they haven't lived up to their potential. We decided to move more of their effectiveness from their raw throughput buff which felt like a penalty for being in the wrong chakra, rather than a bonus for being in the right Chakra into their bonus effects, and the Holy Word spells that they grant. Please note that all Priest healing spells have been retuned to account for the loss of throughput increases from Chakras. We also returned Renew to a normal 1.5-second global cooldown GCD, so that Renew blanketing is still possible, but less ideal without Haste. Finally, the ability for Power Word: Shield to critically strike or Multistrike is now baseline for all Priest specializations instead of just Disciplins so that it continues to be a viable choice for Holy at higher gear levels.


Cascade http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/121148 no longer refreshes the duration of Renew http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/139 for Chakra: Serenity http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/81208.
Circle of Healing http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/34861 cooldown is now 12 seconds up from 10 seconds.
Chakra: Sanctuary http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/81206 no longer now increases healing of area-of-effect spells. It now causes healing spell casts to reduce the remaining cooldown on Circle of Healing http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/34861 by 1 second instead of always reducing the cooldown by 2 seconds. by 10% down from 25%.
Chakra: Serenity http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/81208 no longer now increases healing of single-target spells. by 10% down from 25%.
Divine Aegis http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/47515 no longer grants Power Word: Shield http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/17 a chance to critically strike.
Power Word: Shield http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/17 now has a chance for a critical effect based on critical strike chance and can Multistrike based on Multistrike chance for all specializations.


Several talents got split into different versions by specialization. We revised the effectiveness of some of these talents to better balance talent choices on their rows.

From Darkness, Comes Light http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/109186 has been split into Surge of Light for Discipline and Holy, and Surge of Darkness for Shadow for Shadow.
Solace and Insanity has been split into Power Word: Solace http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/129250 for Discipline and Holy, and Insanity for Shadow.
Surge of Light's activation chance has been reduced to 10% down from 15%.


There are a few other miscellaneous changes. 

Angelic Feather http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/121536 now increases movement speed by 60% down from 80%. If cast on players, will always prefer the casting Priest over others, then pick the player closest to the targeted location. If there are no players where it is targeted, it will still create a feather that can be picked up, as before. Additionally, when collecting multiple feathers, the duration will be extended instead of replaced; up to a maximum of 130% of base duration.



http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue
In our efforts to reduce cooldown stacking across the game, we chose to remove the damage increase from Tricks of the Trade. And second, we decided to loosen the weapon requirements on Assassination. It's important to note that we still intend for daggers to be the optimal choice for Assassination Rogues, but this change will help Rogues who want to try out Assassination but don't have two daggers.


Assassinâ€™s Resolve no longer requires daggers to function.
Dispatch http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/111240 can now be used with fist weapons or one-handed swords, dealing 331% weapon damage instead of 480% when used with those weapons instead of a dagger.
Mutilate http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/1329 can now be used with fist weapons or one-handed swords, dealing 137% weapon damage instead of 200% when used with those weapons instead of a dagger.
Sinister Strike http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/1752 now deals 188% weapon damage when used with a dagger instead of 130%.
Tricks of the Trade http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/57934 now has no energy cost and no longer increases damage caused by the target by 15%.


Worth noting here is the removal of Ambidexterity http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/13852. This was done to reduce the amount of damage coming from auto attacks for Combat Rogues. Weâ€™ve increased the damage of their active abilities to compensate and make them more rewarding.

To better balance the scaling rates and value of secondary stats for Subtlety, we reduced the power of their Sinister Calling http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/31220 passive ability.

Sinister Calling http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/31220 now increases Agility by 15% down from 30%.



http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman

Earth Elemental deals 90% less Auto Attack damage but generates 1000% more threat.
Using Unleashed Fury http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/117012 with Windfury Weapon http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8232 imbue active now increases Multistrike chance by 5%.
Tidal Waves http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/51564 now reduces the cast time of Healing Wave http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/331 by 20% down from 30%.
Unleash Life http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/73685 no longer increases the healing from Healing Rain http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/73920 but its direct healing has been increased by 100%.



http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock 
For Affliction, we're happy with their rotation. But, Drain Soul http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/1120 was causing them to be too strong in situations where they had a steady supply of small creatures to kill. We reduced the effectiveness of its on-kill effect in order to solve this.

Drain Soul http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/1120 now creates 1 Soul Shard down from 4 Soul Shards http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/117198 when the target dies.


Kil'jaeden's Cunning http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/119049 was a problematic talent. We've reduced the ability for ranged damage dealers to deal damage while moving in Warlords. Kil'jaeden's Cunning http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/119049 became much stronger relative to other casters. We redesigned how the ability works to be more powerful in bursts instead of always affecting only some spells.


Kilâ€™jaedenâ€™s Cunning has been redesigned. Kil'jaeden's Cunning http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/119049 calls upon the cunning of Kil'jaeden to permit movement while casting Warlock spells. This spell may be cast while casting other spells and lasts 15 seconds with a 2-minute cooldown.



http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior 
We wanted to fix a few problems with Warriors. Prominently, we still weren't happy with Arms' rotation and neither were many players, so we've made some more changes. The goal is to remove needless complexity while simultaneously adding more depth. As mentioned in the above section on Ability Pruning, Overpower and Heroic Strike have been removed for Arms Warriors. In their place, Slam now costs less Rage, and Execute has been revised to provide more dynamic gameplay throughout the whole fight while still retaining its identity of a low-health finisher.

In addition, we werenâ€™t satisfied with the Mastery for Arms. The intended flavor for Arms is about hitting with few, big, and heavy weapon strikes. Strikes of Opportunity actually went opposite of that, adding frequent little hits. Weâ€™ve replaced Strikes of Opportunity with a new Mastery which accentuates their intended design.


Mastery: Strikes of Opportunity http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/76838 has been removed, and replaced with a new ability, Mastery: Weapons Master.

Mastery: Weapons Master increases the damage of Colossus Smash http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/86346, Slam http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/1464, and Execute http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5308 abilities by 20% increasing with Mastery.

Executioner is a new passive ability for Arms Warriors.

Executioner causes the Warrior's auto attack hits to generate an additional 40 Rage against targets with less than 20% health remaining. Additionally, the Execute http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5308 ability no longer requires the target to be below 20% health to use, but its Rage cost is increased by 100%.

Colossus Smash http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/86346 no longer increases the damage of Slam http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/1464.
Mortal Strike http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/12294 now generates 20 Rage up from 10 Rage.
Slam http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/1464 now costs 15 Rage down from 25 Rage and no longer has additional effects when Sweeping Strikes http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/12328 is active.


Fury Warriors received a few additional changes. We made a revision to the critical strike chance of Bloodthirst http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/23881 to make them less crit-dependant. A new glyph has been added which gives Fury Warriors a choice for a notably different playstyle. Auto attack damage had become too high, so we also moved some damage from that into Execute http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5308 which has been changed to deal damage based on Weapon Damage, instead of just Attack Power. Plus, we've updated some to spell alerts to improve usability.


Bloodthirst http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/23881 now has 30% additional Critical Strike chance instead of double the normal Critical Strike chance.
Crazed Berserker http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/23588 no longer increases auto attack damage. Instead, it also causes Execute http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5308 to hit with the off-hand weapon.
Glyph of Colossus Smash http://beta.wowdb.com/items/63481 is a new glyph available to Fury Warriors. The glyph increases the duration of Colossus Smash http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/86346 effect to 20 seconds, but reduces its effectiveness.
