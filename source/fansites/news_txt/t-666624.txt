For The Horde http://www.for-the-horde.org/ only needed a few hours to go through the hard mode of the 10-Man Trial of the Crusader .... without wiping. They are the first guild to complete the A Tribute to Insanity 10 Players http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3810/a-tribute-to-insanity-10-player/ achievement.
