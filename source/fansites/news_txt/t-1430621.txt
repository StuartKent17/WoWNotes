GC said "if don't want to multi DoT, don't play Shadow Priest". Now I think - is there any ranged class that doesnt multidot?
Some are more multi-DoT heavy than others. Mages in WoD won't multi-DoT at all Well, technically, Pyro's DoT could be multi-DoTed. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411959846640967681
Elemental is also fairly light on multi-DoTing. Not zero, but relatively little, compared to Shadow/Balance/Affliction. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411960431872180224
How about Destruction and Demonology, are they hit with multi dotting options now you only mention Affliction?
Multi-DoTing is a core Warlock attribute; all specs will include it to some extent, Affliction most of all. Basically same as now Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/412297033043566592

What is the reasoning behind having Rogues and other classes who dual wield have white attacks still be missable in WoD? 1/2
It keeps DW balanced with 2H. If we were to remove it, we'd have to reduce the damage of 1Hs or 1H attacks. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411718347147845632
If OH white weapon damage was reduced instead of missing, would that solve the "bad feeling" of seeing misses?
OH hits currently hit for 50%. Would you rather they hit for 25%? That's what it'd take. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411949143846694912

WoD Vengeance: Why not have abilities just go to the DK's % of damage over the last 5 seconds and do away with the wierd buff?
Mechanically, 5sec vs 20sec is one difference. Also smoothing. You don't think the hidden dmg-taken-last-5sec is weirder? Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411181970194837504
No. I think a stacking AP buff but only for certain spells, which is only caused by some attacks, just feels overcomplicated.
It won't be an AP buff anymore. We also MAY not need the Vengeance on Taunts anymore either, or the bump to 50% of expected. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411334196406149120
But you're still keeping the +100% threat during Taunt's fixate period right?
200%, but yeah. That's what MAY make it OK to remove those two things. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411403663777603584

hello, i wonder if all the healers will have their mana pool locked in WoD like in MoP. pls no.
What is it that you liked about variable mana pools, besides just seeing the number get bigger? Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414951087452348416
Compared to being able to cast 6 fireballs for example instead of 4 before running out of mana.
But that never actually played out in practice, right? Mana pools have never been small enough that they were the limiter. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414956499874500609

Have you considered making catch-all icons for tier talents that reflect current choice? Macros for it are unwieldy.
Yes, going to try to make more talent rows work like Mage Bomb in terms of sharing a button. Can't do so in all cases, but most. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414611786713681920
Great news, thanks!
Sure. It works for things like Priest 90 or Monk 30. Not so well for things like Rogue 90. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414623243966767104

any chance of druids not losing model change effects from toys when shifting forms? Already works ok in ragefire scenario
Current tech needs major rework for it to happen universally. Those scenarios took tons of ridiculous scripting and spells. T_T Source https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/417351857401368576

1st Merry Xmas, 2nd how will dots work for balance druids with the change to snapshot? I'm referring to eclipse as a dmg mofier.
Eclipses' effects will snapshot on Moonfire/Sunfire. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/415955584291049472
How will the mechanic change to make up for that? One of the few snapshots left. Won't balance DPS be very swingy?
Perhaps a misunderstanding? I'm saying that it'll stay as it is today. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416686742318505984
So Sunfire and Moonfire will still snapshot haste, crit and eclipse buffs?
No, Eclipse will. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416745461551071233

- how do you feel the Glyph of Efflo is working? Are we going to see it kept in place for WoD, or should we expect changes?
We like the concept. It's probably too powerful for something so passive, so we may adjust tuning. That goes for all healers in general though; we want to time down passive healing and smart healing across the board. Most healing should come from actives.

Dear Santa: please give us tameable mantid tanks and pterodactyls in the near future. Wait, Christmas has already passed? Dang..

I'm fairly sure many hunters would love it if you looked into it! How about mantid tanks? Any chance for those? /nervousface
I'd say it's unlikely for a few reasons, but who knows! Source https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/417353694288424960
Addendum: Not that I'm unappreciative of your answer Just curious. Love silithids; would take mantid tanks over anything.
Hunter pets are an odd thing & a source of internal debate. I'll admit to not understanding/agreeing w/ some allowed & unallowed. Source https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/417358150056960001

I'm a hunter player for 5 years now.I know you ain't heading for a revamp though i need to ask will MM/SV/BM feel different?
That is precisely our goal. We don't think that requires a "revamp" or "overhaul". Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414890362209959937

But saying stuff like "Frost Mages do not scale well with gear because they experience many low % soft-caps." Is okay, right?
Almost. Softcaps reduce scaling rate, but that says nothing of whether the scaling rate was OP before, or if the difference is significant. In Frost's case, the next secondary is close in value, so its effect is minor, and their scaling prior to that was higher than normal, because we expect most high end Frost mages to hit that early soft cap. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410895553447206912
even it comes with some sort of nerf to balance things out. these are frost "scaling" problems as i see them
Having only some of your spells scale with some stats isn't a problem though, as long as the stats stay... Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411784892779745280
...valuable. Also, several of those DO scale with haste; you get more ILs and FFBs with more haste. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411785080411942912
as being worth the loss of dmg from continuing to stack haste beyond that point. I enjoy fast gameplay, the need to
Most of the issue you're talking about is caused by the Legendary Metagem. 20% haste was a mistake; caps GCDs. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411950096868065281

Might I ask what the design concept for WW Monks was? Main curiosities, Touch of Karma, their healing, and mobility+raw damage
I wasn't here, but I think the fantasy of being a monk is using mystical martial arts to damage & dismantle your opponent. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413085269433122816

Any closer to fixing WW monks hitbox? It's been our biggest problem since MOP release with hundreds of threads complaining.
We heard that early on, and investigated and found no evidence of it actually existing. It's how WoW handles latency for all melee Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417078610185297920

.Given the changes to Mistweaving/fistweaving you discussed before, will this also change based upon healing stances?
Mistweavers will count as melee, regardless of stance. Don't want them afraid to swap between stances. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/412679608182390784

how is chi explosion supposed to help brewmaster survivability?
What each chi level does isn't very useful in what you saw at BlizzCon. Changes are coming to it. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411959016571428864

Hey guy, would you pray tell why Crackling Jade Lightning costs mana on cast but doesn't damage?

Will Sacred Shield ever be made more useful for Ret Paladins PvP? A simple 10% buff and allowing it be used on 2 targets would do.
We made a lot of effort to change that row in 5.2 and 5.4. It's tough to balance those spells for the 3 specs. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/411014244377690112

IMO, Deep Healing would be good as a situational/optional talent, but too situational for a mastery

Warrior haste: why not let it increase rage generated by rage gen abilities. MS = 10r* haste%. Works for all specs. Unbuff conv.
That's one option that we're considering to make haste valuable for Warriors. It 'feels' a little weird, but OK. Feedback welcome. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417387244970708992

Just look at class representation, every roles fotm now, you took skill away and replaced it with re rolling
We've looked into it. Very few people re-roll fotm for example, warriors/mages right now. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/412659937500622848

Symbiosis seems impossible to balance in PvP; Maybe it should be PvE only. What do you think?
I think impossible is a strong word here but I don't deny the inequity here. Reshuffling it in WoD to be mostly defensive CDs. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/412400200355827712

Misc
May be I have different psychology, but I really hate competition in game.
That's a totally valid mindset for gaming, and one we attempt to support, along with others. Hard to balance at times. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417376826646724609

I really like WoW's audio, but I have two sound-related beefs that aren't really sound...1 When you fly over a zone, music changes so often you barely get to hear it. 2 Too many sounds at once in 25M raiding. Would be possible to intelligently pick the right sounds to play? I know that's a dangerous road but it's overwhelming atm
I completely agree. No promises yet for WoD, but currently working on is a system that will help bring more clarity to the game. Source https://twitter.com/analogmad/status/417369071928098816
