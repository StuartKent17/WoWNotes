Patch 8.2.5 PTR - Bee Mount Alliance Exclusive
We knew going into the PTR that the bee mount was going to be an Alliance specific quest chain, but many assumed it would work much like Kua'fon  and Child of Torcali  which are usable on Alliance even though the methods to obtain them are Horde exclusive. Currently on the PTR, the Honeyback Harvester's Harness  is the only bee mount in the mount journal and has the Alliance symbol next to it, meaning it is only rideable by Alliance characters. This could change, however, as the PTR is still early.


 


Patch 8.2.5 PTR - New Addition to the Mount Journal Preview

Patch 8.2.5 PTR - Party Sync New Quest Tracker UI Elements
The Patch 8.2.5 PTR is currently testing the new party sync feature, and the quest tracker ui now has two new icons to let you know if you are replaying a quest you completed and whether or not you will receive bonus loot for participating.
