Patch 8.2.5 PTR - Bee Mount Alliance Exclusive
We knew going into the PTR that the bee mount was going to be an Alliance specific quest chain, but many assumed it would work much like Kua'fon https://www.wowdb.com/items/159146-kuafons-harness and Child of Torcali https://www.wowdb.com/items/168408-child-of-torcali which are usable on Alliance even though the methods to obtain them are Horde exclusive. Currently on the PTR, the Honeyback Harvester's Harness https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/170069-honeyback-harvesters-harness is the only bee mount in the mount journal and has the Alliance symbol next to it, meaning it is only rideable by Alliance characters. This could change, however, as the PTR is still early.
