#422 New - Dearest $n, I look back upon our adventures together as if they happened yesterday. Several of my admirers informed me that you looked rather... sullen... when last we met. While I see no reason for such behavior when you had the pleasure of working with the world-renowned Johnny Awesome, I did feel a twang of... what was it... pity? Being as such, I felt it appropriate to send you this tip as a token of my appreciation for your efforts. Do people still tip? Listen, if people do NOT still tip, please return all attachments to me at once. I'm not made of money, you know. -Johnny
