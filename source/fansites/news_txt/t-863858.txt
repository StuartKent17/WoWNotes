Boubouille2011-03-06, 03:36 PMPatch 4.2 - Season 10 Armor Models Preview
Everything is starting to work nicely on my side after the PTR build and it's time to release the slightly more interesting stuff! Let's start with the Season 10 armor sets!



Yes, I said Patch 4.2 and not 4.1. It was confirmed in a blue post 
The amount of recolors vary for each class, I only used the ones actually used on items to try to minimize confusion. 
The sets are previewed on humans because they have perfect proportions and are the best way to display all the pieces of an armor set.
