The Burning Legion is heading our way and to help thin the number of demons already in the lands of Azeroth, we&#x2019;ve teamed up with various community members to set a bounty on their heads.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ve gathered some of our finest generals from the community to lead the onslaught. You&#x2019;ll want to follow them closely and be ready to jump into the fray to take on the demon they issue a bounty on. Once the demon is targeted, you&#x2019;ll be asked to head into Azeroth, Outland, or Draenor, to screenshot any demon of that specific type (dead or alive), and tweet it using the associated hashtag.<br>
<br>
Your efforts could result in netting you a key to the Legion beta test and joining the thousands who have already been testing the upcoming expansion.<br>
