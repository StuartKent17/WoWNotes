<br>
Patch 5.4.2 - Raid Browser<br>
Patch 5.4.2 updated the old Raid Browser interface to work across all realms for Ordos, Celestials, and Siege of Orgrimmar Flex wings. This has made finding a group much quicker, allowing you to list your character or your own group in the Browser, as well as a comment. <br>
<br>
The Raid Browser also passes along other information that isn&apos;t displayed by the default UI, as well as allowing anyone to message anyone listed for a raid, which could allow for enterprising addon authors to create an alternative listing view that would allow other users of the addon to share information such as achievements, number of boss kills, and groups for other things by using hidden whispers. This could be done without requiring people to make a mess of their friends list with random battletags or impacting performance when not looking for a group.<br>

<br>
<br>
Addon - LFRAdvanced<br>
Using the additional information passed along by the game, LFRAdvanced (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/lfradvanced) will make the default Browser UI slightly more useful by displaying the item level of players looking for a group, the item level of players in a group, and the group item level. The item level is provided by the game, which uses your maximum item level, rather than equipped item level. <br>
<br>
It also shows other stats that are passed along by the game, but not normally displayed in the window. If you want to disable those stats, you can do &quot;/script LFRAdvancedOptions.ShowStats=false&quot;.<br>
<br>
It will also add a button to open the Raid Browser to the frame used to queue for PvE activities. The addon is still rough around the edges, but is a nice improvement over the default listing UI. <br>

Dampening Hotfix Incoming<br>
No need for alarm &#x2013; we&#x2019;ll be hotfixing Dampening back to a 10-minute start time (with Arena matches ending at 20 minutes). <br>
<br>
As you might be aware, the WoW Arena Invitational at BlizzCon was configured to have Dampening begin at 5 minutes, with a 15-minute round timer. Those changes were intended solely for BlizzCon, but made it over to live servers as part of the 5.4.2 patch. Again, this was unintentional, and we&#x2019;ll be hotfixing things back to normal ASAP.<br>
<br>
no, but saying &quot;it will be reverted&quot; (Lore) isn&apos;t the same as PLAINLY NOT SAYING it will be reverted when asked (Holinka) but rather saying &quot;it&apos;s out there now, so gauging reaction&quot;.<br>
I spoke with Brian immediately before posting. Since his tweet, we had continued to discuss internally, looked at the initial feedback, and decided the right thing to do was to put things back how they were. There is no contradiction here, only the passage of time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dismiss Pet and Arenas<br>
This change was intentional. Unfortunately, it didn&apos;t make it into the patch notes.<br>
<br>
Dismiss Pet was frequently being used to bypass cooldowns on certain pet abilities, such as Roar of Sacrifice, or to swap out a dangerously wounded pet for one at full health. Neither of those were intended behavior. Furthermore, our design is that choosing your pet should feel similar to choosing a glyph or talent during pre-match preparation. <br>
<br>
With this change, Hunters are able to switch pets during the pre-match preparation period, but unable to dismiss them once the match has begun.<br>
<br>

Upcoming Paragons Hotfix<br>
This was an unintended side-effect of attempting to fix the occasional issue where a Paragon would melee a player from midair while jumping into battle. We&apos;re reverting the change ASAP (overnight restarts will probably be required), since the current state is clearly far worse. Apologies for the inconvenience.

Garrosh&apos;s Trial<br>
Getting real sick of these books to be honest. I&apos;d like to see all these story arcs in game, seeing as how Warcraft has always been a video game series first and foremost. <br>
We try to fit in what we can. There are a variety of factors that go into deciding these things. Time, resources, and (of course) whether there&apos;s some compelling gameplay to go with it are all factors. We can also tell a much deeper story in the novel. That doesn&apos;t mean there can&apos;t be elements that you can experience or encounter to some extent within the game (story wise). These aren&apos;t always easy decisions for the designers, but they do what they can. Our Creative Development team also puts a lot of work into the novels to make sure we do a good job of filling in what doesn&apos;t make it into the game and the book is in good hands with Christie Golden.<br>
<br>
I have to imagine this answer was unintentionally vague.<br>
I was actually intentionally a bit vague since I&apos;m not aware of what specific elements surrounding this will make it into the game and in what ways (at current). It&apos;s all in development and consists of many layers. At the same time, we&apos;ve already announced the book and that it will cover the trial among other revelations. WoW Insider has a nice look at it - http://wow.joystiq.com/2013/11/18/exclusive-first-look-at-christie-goldens-new-novel-war-crimes/ <br>
<br>
A point worth noting in the interview is the following:<br>
<br>
Is this going to tie into Warlords of Draenor, like Tides of War and The Shattering? <br>
<br>
It&apos;s more of a bridge. It&apos;ll take us from one place to the other.<br>
Dave Kosak has said as well that we want to tie in what we can tie in, but I couldn&apos;t say how much we&apos;ll be able to do or how currently. I also disdain being the bearer of spoilers when I can avoid it (which is sometimes more difficult that you might think.)<br>
<br>
I understand the concerns and this has been a good thread to read. I just wouldn&apos;t get too caught up in what is or what won&apos;t be. The expansion is in development and there&apos;s a lot of ground we&apos;ll be covering including a lot of great new story arcs and experiences.

Patch 5.4.2 In-Game Store<br>
When you go to purchase in game, you click the &quot;Buy Now&quot; option (after selecting the pet or mount you want) and an additional window will open saying you&apos;re being connected to the Shop. You&apos;ll then get another confirmation window that explains how you&apos;ll be charged. (I believe if you want to change this, you have to change that in your Battle.net Account options on the site.) The transaction should only finalize when you click the &quot;Buy Now&quot; button again.<br>
<br>
I didnt even see what it was charging it too? Is that what the confirmation window does?<br>
<br>
Because i pressed to buy now buttons 1 was in the window with all the pets, the 2nd one with the individual pets and then all my UI disappeared and a blue boarder came up and i got the mount..? <br>
In the second window that pops up it will say : &quot;This will be charged to your: [payment method ]&quot; right within the Shop Confirmation (above where the price is).<br>
<br>
We&apos;ll keep an eye on things to see if there are issues with it, but it should be working properly. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/284070-important-cash-shop-suggestion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10787139397?page=1#9))<br>
