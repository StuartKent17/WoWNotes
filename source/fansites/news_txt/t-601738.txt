Boubouille2007-08-15, 08:25 AMPaypal now accepted for subscriptions !
For the moment, this feature was only announced on the US website. 

We're pleased to announce that we're now able to accept PayPal payments for World of Warcraft subscriptions. Both current and new subscribers can now assign their PayPal account as their automatic payment method on the Account Management page. If you wish to open a PayPal account or want to learn more about the popular online payment system, the PayPal website has the details.

Class balance
Rogues are getting balanced, other classes too. Rogues should read the original post http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=450715166, it should let them know what kind of change they can expect.

There are a lot of valid concerns and thoughts inhere, so I would like to blue-tag this thread just to let you know we have both seen and read this thread. Most of the things posted inhere have been forwarded to the developers already, and some of the things have already been commented in other threads both on these forums and the US forums.

It is taking time indeed, but for a good reason. Many classes are getting adjusted, not just Rogues, so time is required in order to make sure that things are done properly. 

Balancing classes in a game like World of Warcraft is not a small task, so I am afraid that patience is something you will have to stock up on at least to a certain degree.
