Yes, I know the hands are bugged on 2 colors but they&apos;re also bugged on the official preview so ... I don&apos;t know.<br>

Tier 12 Official Preview - Druid and Warrior<br>
Blizzard finally released the last 2 previews (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/172687/tier-12-armor-set-preview-updated-6-13) of Tier 12 armor sets, the Warrior and Druid sets. It means I finally have a confirmation that the T12 Druid set use pants and I can work on final versions of Tier 12 pages. Yay! <br>
