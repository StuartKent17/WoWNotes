Kosumoth the Hungering Orbs Hotfixed
In addition to the hotfixes below, players are reporting  that the orbs for Kosumoth the Hungering are now clickable by multiple people. 


  


Patch 7.0.3 Hotfixes - September 13
Classes
 Druid Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Shifting into Bear Form will no longer freeze resource decay for non-Guardian druids.


 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Barrage range will now correctly match the range of the Hunter’s other abilities.

Developers’ Notes: During the recent updates to Barrage, we discovered it extended approximately 2 yards beyond the range of autoshot and other abilities. We’re changing it to more closely match.



 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Hammer of the Righteous will no longer show its impact visual on dead targets.


 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Ghostly Strike debuff application and removal are now correctly posted to the combat log.


 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Soul Shards now regenerate to 3, while out of combat up from 1.

Developers' Notes: As discussed in last week’s Developer Q&A, warlocks and Demonology especially needed to go through several spellcasts in order to generate the Soul Shards required to cast the spells needed for them to operate at peak efficiency. In outdoor gameplay and against packs of enemies in dungeons, this often meant that combat was ending just as the warlock was getting warmed up. Allowing warlocks to begin combat with 3 Soul Shards instead of 1 should let them bring more of their arsenal to bear in shorter encounters.



 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Mannoroth's Bloodletting Manacles now heals the warrior based on base Rage spent, rather than actual rage spent, to account for Rage cost reduction effects.
Arms Colossus Smash's cooldown reduced to 30s.

Developers' Notes: The cooldown on Colossus Smash serves as bad luck protection against long streaks of Tactician not activating. At 45 seconds, the worst case scenario of actually waiting for the full cooldown to elapse was a rare occurrence that was particularly noticeable and frustrating when it happened. At 30 seconds, the majority of the time Colossus Smash will still reset before its cooldown elapses, but those unlucky streaks should feel a little better.


Arms Focused Rage's damage bonus reduced to 40% per stack.


Dungeons

Luck of the Draw  now properly increases pet and guardian damage.
Assault on Violet Hold

Sael'orn will no long aggro players immediately when she spawns.
Fel Prison will no longer target healers in Heroic and Mythic difficulty.

Maw of Souls

Resolved an issue where Nether Rip didn’t appear on lower graphics settings.



Items

Hotfix work in progress Emissary bags from completing World Quests now contain equippable items for your class.
The Derelict Skyhorn Kite  now has a 15 minute cooldown.


NPCs

The Imperial Arcanist and the Imperial Spellbreaker that spawn in front of Lothrius Mooncaller’s room in Suramar – The Athenaeum no longer drop loot or grant experience when killed by the Moonfall Manafiend summoned by a player or by Lothrius Mooncaller.
Regular creatures at Warden Towers should spawn more rapidly when attacked by many players.
Brimstone Destroyers in Azsuna can no longer be enslaved.


Professions

Mother's Skinning Knife  is now only usable by players who know Skinning.
Several Alchemy quests which required Heroic Dungeon kills can now be completed in Mythic.
Engineering

Players should no longer be able to skill up Engineering in Legion by making Gearspring Parts. It should now be slightly easier to skill up to 800 by making goggles or Trigger.
The Arcanic Compressor is now multi-drop and can be looted several engineers in a group for completion of “Revamping the Recoil”.



PvP

Several followers have had the effectiveness of their abilities reduced against players.
Fixed an issue causing some PvP World Quests to have invalid rewards for Honor level 50 players.
Flickering Shadows  will no longer activate if the Rogue is capturing a point in Domination maps such as Arathi Basin.
The time between Wintergrasp and Tol Barad battles has been increased to 1 hour.
Skirmish victories now award 100 honor was 50.
The first random battleground win of the day now rewards a Soldier's Splendor 250 Artifact Power.


Quests

In the Warrior Class Campaign Ulduar Scenario, the door after Brood Queen Morvaniss should now always open when you kill her.


On the World Quest “Ley Race”, ley line nodes should now spawn more quickly as you go.
Death Knights should no longer become stuck on “Steeds of the Damned”.
Druids should no longer be stuck on “Gathering the Dreamweavers”.
Players that manage to find themselves in the "Champions of Elune" scenario without a vehicle will now be teleported out after 30 seconds.
Bind on Equip items have been removed as possible rewards from World Quests.

Developers’ Notes: As a player’s own item level increases, the quality of many World Quest item rewards rises as well. However, when these items can circulate throughout the economy, they can overshadow other sources of loot, and crafted items especially. World Quests should feel rewarding, but we want that to be because of a direct value to your character.



The Warden Tower World Quests are now on 6 hour rotations was 3 hours.
Withered in the Withered Army Training scenario should now be able to throw rocks from point blank range. Ow!

Hidden Artifact Appearances
We can confirm that the processes for obtaining these alternate appearances are all in the game and functioning properly. Once you’ve met all the appropriate requirements – some of which involve content that hasn’t yet been released, or will take some time to complete – the appearance will be granted to your character.

Warden Tower Hotfix
do you dislike people getting honor via towers or was the nerf to prevent people from feeling the need to do em every 3 hours?
We like how rewarding the towers are for the time spent, but don't want them to be the primary source of Honor. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Druid Armor Set Legs
Good news to share here - this should be fixed in patch 7.1.

The issue stemmed from the chest piece of the Druid set not having the bottom half of the robe set correctly. I also noticed that a similar issue affected the Mage Order Hall Leggings, which were using the Druid set skin, so those have been fixed as well.

Cheers! Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
What design decision do you regret the most, from all games?
I have a lot of regrets about Raid Finder for WoW. I am sure I worked on features that were much, much worse, but that's the first one that came to mind.

To be clear, the goal of getting more players into raiding is a good one. But the way Raid Finder turned out removed, IMO anyway, a lot of the epicness of what made raiding raiding. I also haven't played WoW in a few years, so it's entirely possible they have solved the problem by now. Source 

You've explained before that back in the days in WoW you wanted to nerf frost mages. How come frost mages were pretty much left untouched for such a long long time? What's the process behind getting something nerfed/buffed like and who has the final word when something gets nerfed/buffed at Blizzard and Riot Games? 
The less diplomatic answer is that there were a lot of WoW devs who played Frost mages, even though I wasn't one of them, so there were always a lot of people to point out your potential mistakes when you try to make a change.

But above and beyond that, it was a tricky design space, because Frost mages were supposed to be good at both tankiness emergency buttons that cover you in ice and burst ice lance combos. When you are good at defense and offense especially burst, you are walking a razor's edge all the time. Source 

One of your former colleagues, Chris Metzen, just announced that he was retiring at 42. I know Chris as the legendary creator of Diablo, Starcraft and Warcraft, my childhood, but can you tell me what Chris was like in the office and how you feel about him 
Chris was a rockstar. That guy you saw on stage at Blizzard? That's 100% legit Metzen. He'd call us brothers and sisters. He'd call us cats. I think once he called me baby. I can't get away with talking like that, but he didn't fake it. That's who he was. He bleeds for his story, his characters, Blizzard, and most importantly, the players.

I first met him at a party, a few years before I went to work at Blizzard. He yelled at the top of his voice in a Scottish dwarvish? accent the entire time.

Sometimes in meetings he would get a far off stare, and you'd know something was bubbling up inside his mind and something great was about to come out.

Once at Blizzcon, he hugged me for like a really long time in the middle of a busy men's room. We blocked the doorway and made a lot of people wait in line that much longer.

A possibly apocryphal story: when Kaplan was new to Blizzard, Metzen came into his office, crashed on the couch for like an hour nap, woke up, asked "Do you know why they won't let us drink at work any longer?" Got up and left. P.S. Blizzard let us drink at work all the time, so I'm not sure what that was all about.

And maybe my favorite story. At a Blizzcon party we were all at, there was inexplicably a bowl of powdered donuts with the snacks. Chris took a donut, rubbed it under his nose so that there's this light dusting of white powder and then left it there all night as he bearhugged and did the Top Gun high-five to everyone at the party.

He's one of the top 5 or so most authentic and yet almost supernatural forces I've ever met. I am lucky to know him. Source
