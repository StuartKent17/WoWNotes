Legion Alpha - Voice Acting<br>
VO work is ongoing! I can&apos;t say to the extent that is remaining, but we&apos;re definitely not at 100% yet.<br>
<br>
As VO comes in, feel free to enter bug reports for things like the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
Sound files that cut each other off during a back and forth conversation (sometimes we get the duration wrong so it&apos;ll become a shouting match)<br>
Sound files that don&apos;t match the written text<br>
Sound files that can&apos;t be heard from a reasonable distance<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Blue Tweets<br>
Character / Items<br>
Could the ability be Strike of the Windlord since the weapon lore says Al&apos;akir imbued the weapon with his power?<br>
Good call. We&apos;ll address this. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/673766589796253697))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
with the removal of honor in Legion, will we be able to purchase old pvp armor for transmog with gold?<br>
That&apos;s one option we&apos;re considering, but haven&apos;t made a final decision yet. Rest assured, they&apos;ll be available somehow. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674016635083096067))<br>
<br>
any plans for gladiator mounts and titles to finally become account wide? Only seems fair with all the account wide pve stuff.<br>
No such plans, no. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674016834035671040))<br>
<br>
Will item level matter regarding stats in low level PvP?<br>
Yes, in a similar manner to max-level PvP. The stat difference will be considerably smaller. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674017015082823681))<br>
<br>
As a major transmogrification and PvP enthusiast, will there still be &quot;Elite&quot; transmogable gear for PvP in Legion?<br>
Gear awarded at higher rating will continue to have the &quot;Elite&quot; designation and appearance. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674017299418877952))<br>
<br>
will pvp tabards be account wide with the new transmog system?<br>
We have no plans to change how the PvP tabards are bound. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674016366496636928))<br>
<br>
Transmogrification<br>
Sorry if this is a repeat: all items from completed quests are auto-added to wardrobe. Does this include Draenor treasures?<br>
You will get credit for any one-time treasures in the same manner as a quest. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674017436325122048))<br>
