When are you planning on updating all of the tooltips that are now wrong?
These require a full client patch, so they'll be fixed in 6.1. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/545073506333896704

PvE
.Please make Augment Runes not work in raids.
That's the point of Augment Runes though... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/545681736567234562

Does that mean Blackrock Foundry is a 6.1 raid?
Nah, Foundry is very much 6.0 content - was fully tested as such on beta. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/545708940529377280

PvP
Many players are overly fixated on representation but probably because it is the only metric to look at. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/542705522328494082
what aught they fixate on, instead?
their own experience playing the game. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/545270832381976576
