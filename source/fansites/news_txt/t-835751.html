Patch 4.0.6 introduces 2 new vendors to the game, the Honor and Justice Trade Goods vendors! They can be found next to the other Justice and Honor NPCs and will sell reagents for a very reasonable price. <br>
<br>
Please note that some of these items are stacks of items so pay attention to the quantity on the icon! The Satchel of Freshly-Picked Herbs (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/68813/satchel-of-freshly-picked-herbs/) contains a selection of 20 random Cataclysm Herbs. <br>

Lady Sinestra First Kill (and bugs)<br>
I do think you have to take the tone of that post in the context in which it was written. Because Sinestra is a super-hardcore boss, they were pretty much the first ones to really push her mechanics to the limits. It&apos;s easy to see from their post that they were understandably frustrated. Not only were they trying to learn the mechanics and develop strategies, but we were watching closely, hotfixing several different issues as they stumbled across them. This meant they had to adapt to the changes we were making on the spot in addition to figuring out how to kill her -- and she&apos;s definitely no pushover.<br>
<br>
We do wish it would have been a cleaner fight for them, but we really appreciate them pushing the limits of hardcore raiding, and testing us to design new and compelling challenges. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/152991/did-paragon-enjoy-their-journey))<br>

Dungeon Difficulty and Ghostcrawler&apos;s Blog - Wow, Dungeons are Hard! (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/829237-Wow-Dungeons-are-Hard!)<br>
I know you&apos;re probably frustrated by any number of issues Ghostcrawler tackled in his blog. We completely get that, which was the entire point of his post. We&apos;re not telling players it&apos;s our way or the highway. We&apos;re not burying our heads in the sand and letting you figure it out. He took a lot of his own time to try and provide some insight and positive reinforcement, admit some design mistakes we&apos;ve made in Cataclysm, and let you know (most importantly) that we hear you.<br>
<br>
We also have to recognize that there is a harsh debate within the community right now about the difficulty level. Players are flinging mud at one another and saying &quot;learn to play&quot;, or &quot;go grind in some other hardcore MMO&quot;. People aren&apos;t in agreement about these things and need to tone down the rhetoric (which Ghostcrawler addresses eloquently in his blog).<br>
<br>
We&apos;re not going to join that debate, though we are players too. The best we can do right now -- as I think Ghostcrawler noted well -- is keep the dialog open and encourage constructive criticism, and even positive feedback. Hearing both what players like and don&apos;t like about select aspects of gameplay is useful to us.<br>
<br>
The entire reason behind him writing that blog sprung from us sending him a particular thread (amongst many other we&apos;ve been sending him since the launch of Cataclysm) that had him really concerned: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1660221627<br>
<br>
He wants to see the tone of the debate changed so we can work together to make this a better game, so it&apos;s really unfortunate when you post as though he&apos;s throwing the naughty finger in your face. His post was not written from a place of hubris. Those who would take it that way probably just fundamentally disagree with the current design philosophy. But only two things are true in this case: 1) we will never please everyone with our design, and 2) we will never stop listening to our players.<br>
<br>
In any event, I appreciate you taking the time to post. I just hope you can keep an open mind and a thoughtful dialog with us, as simply sharing with us how you perceive Ghostcrawler&apos;s attitude to be won&apos;t move game design anywhere. That&apos;s just the reality of it all. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/152998/ghostcrawlers-article-on-dungeons))<br>

Removing guild reputation requirements for officers<br>
Sounds great, here&apos;s how that would work out: I have an awesome end-game progression guild. We&apos;re level 25. You give me 20k gold, I send you an invite and promote you to the highest officer rank. You buy whatever rewards you want, and then leave.<br>
<br>
This is not the intent of the system. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/152013/guild-rep-is-100-stupid))</div></div>
