<a name="noteupdate"></a>Update #2 - Patch notes have been updated on both EU and US official sites and Kalgan made an interesting blue post regarding class balance in Arena. 
In Memoriam: Gary Gygax
Blizzard Entertainment would like to dedicate the patch in memory of Gary Gygax. His work on D&D was an inspiration to us in many ways and helped spark our passion for creating games of our own. As avid D&D players and fellow game developers, we were all saddened by the news of his passing; we feel we’ve lost a true adventuring companion. Thanks for everything and farewell, Gary. You will be missed.

Class balance in Arenas
No other warlock nerfs are planned for 2.4. One of the things we look at is class representation in arenas although normalized for class popularity. In this particular chart, a value of 100% means the class is represented as we'd expect, a value over 100% means the class is represented that much more often than we'd expect, a value below 100% means they're represented less than we'd want obviously this chart doesn't include a spec breakdown in any way.


one other detail regarding the chart, this one is set at 2200+ rating.

2v2 3v3 5v5
Druid 276.0% 184.0% 80.5%
Hunter 43.0% 50.2% 43.0%
Mage 8.7% 96.0% 96.0%
Paladin 19.7% 29.5% 147.4%
Priest 113.3% 164.8% 185.4%
Shaman 37.8% 50.4% 138.6%
Rogue 144.2% 175.1% 61.8%
Warlock 149.2% 93.2% 111.9%
Warrior 130.4% 90.7% 79.3%

Here's 1850...

Druid 184.0% 138.0% 92.0%
Hunter 50.2% 50.2% 50.2%
Mage 61.1% 87.3% 87.3%
Paladin 68.8% 88.4% 137.6%
Priest 133.9% 133.9% 154.5%
Shaman 75.6% 88.2% 138.6%
Rogue 154.5% 154.5% 82.4%
Warlock 121.2% 102.5% 102.5%
Warrior 90.7% 85.0% 85.0%


Locks are doing pretty well overall, but what had us worried was that it appeared to us a month ago or so as though warlocks were on an uptrend. However, the evidence is strong that that trend is reversing, which means significant nerfs aren't really what we want right now we really don't know where those numbers will settle down.

Update - The Twin Eredars are killable again, and we'll probably see a few new items from them ! The first of them is [Book of Highborne Hymns]

Due to the nature of the Warlocks and Shaman changes, you should seriously wait for a confirmation from an official source before going crazy. I could also be wrong and suck at interpreting game files.
