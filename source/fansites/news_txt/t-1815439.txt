Warcraft Movie Teaser
Legendary released a nice teaser for the Warcraft movie tonight. This is best viewed with their app on your phone, as it is a 360 spherical video. The video below will not give you the same experience.

We contacted them to ask if recording would be allowed during the presentation and if they would release the footage from it to the public, but only got confirmation that no recording will be allowed.

Mythic Hellfire Citadel Progression
Method is still ahead at 12/13 today. You can keep up with the latest progress on WoWProgress , our forum thread , and Manaflask 


 


Patch 6.2 Hotfixes - July 8
Creatures and NPCs
Tanaan Jungle

Captain Ironbeard  now has a guaranteed chance to drop Equipment Blueprint: Ghostly Spyglass 
Varyx the Damned  now returns to his spawn location instead of despawning if he drops out of combat. Additionally, only 1 beam needs to be blocked to restart the encounter.


Quests
Garrison Quests

[Requires a realm restart] Fixed an issue where completing daily assault objectives in Tanaan Jungle was incorrectly also granting completion credit for daily assault objectives in the Garrison.

Spires of Arak

Call of the Raven Mother  Fixed an issue where interacting with items during the ritual was causing player pets to use their abilities.


Raids and Dungeons
Hellfire Citadel
Tyrant Velhari

Fixed a timing issue that could cause Tyrant Velhari to use the incorrect finishing move just as a transition into the next stage happened.

Xhul'horac

Adjusted scaling to reduce the amount of health by roughly 10% on Xhul'horac, Omnus, Unstable Voidfiend, and Vanguard Akkelion for a 10-player raid on Normal and Heroic difficulty. Health should remain the same as before for raids with 30 players.

Mannoroth

Mannoroth no longer transforms back into a skeleton after being defeated.
Fixed an issue that could cause Gazing Shadows to sometimes not reduce movement speed.


PvP
Ashran

Fixed a number of issues affecting Ashran events that could cause characters to drop out of stealth effects.


Items

Increased stat bonuses for critical strike, Versatility, Stamina, and Spirit on all Wild Gladiator Warlords Season 2 trinkets by 50%.


UI

Clicking “Join Raid” in the Adventure Guide should now open the Premade Groups menu instead of Raid Finder.


Classes
 Monk Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Armor Sets

Yesterday's hotfix on July 7 for Tier-18 4-piece set bonus for Mistweaver Monks should now be healing for the correct amount.


 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Talents

Yesterday’s hotfix on July 7 that reduced the healing of Execution Sentence by 25% in PvP combat now only applies to Holy Paladins. It has been returned to its previous effectiveness for Retribution and Protection Paladins.

Warcraft Movie Trailer at SDCC
Well, as the Legendary Comic-Con page says:

Legendary’s Hall H panel will be taking place on Saturday from 2:30pm-3:30pm, and hosted by Chris Hardwick of Nerdist. WARCRAFT fans in particular, you will not want to miss it. Hint, hint!

Anyone at Comic-Con this week/weekend should certainly fit the Legendary panel into their schedule. I've gone quite a few times and I'm pretty consistently surprised at how many times I'm told I'll never get in, or that I need to camp for days, when I always show up just a little early that morning and get into the hall with room to spare. If you're there, it's not as crazy as everyone makes it out to be. In my experience anyway. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 


Racials and PvP
So, we agree that Every Man for Himself  is a problem. It's one that we want to fix. It's also a more complicated issue to solve than it may initially seem. We want to reduce the effectiveness of the Human racial, but we don't want to leave Humans with a useless racial either.

With Patch 6.2, we reduced the effectiveness of on-use trinkets which, in turn, reduced the relative strength of having two throughput trinkets equipped. Today, we’ve just pushed a hotfix that increases the raw stats on the Medallion trinkets e.g. Versatility, Crit, Stamina, or Spirit by 50%. 

Our intent with both of these changes is to still allow Humans to benefit from equipping two throughput trinkets, but reduce how much of a benefit that is when compared to equipping a Medallion enough that other racial abilities feel more competitive. We'd love to hear how this change is working out once you've had a chance to play with it a little.

Re: "Why not just get rid of racials entirely?"

We like racials. It's cool that there's a subtle difference for, say, a Rogue who chooses Orc instead of Undead, or a Priest who picks Night Elf instead of Dwarf. It makes each race feel different in a way that isn't just cosmetic. It's only a problem when one is so much better than the others that you feel stupid for playing anything else.

Realistically, sure, there will probably always be a "best" race -- just like there will probably always be a "best" healer, or "best" comp, etc. That's to be expected. We just want things to be close enough that there's some room for difference of opinion on what exactly the "best" option is.

Looking through this thread and some responses on Twitter, I'm already seeing some people saying "Humans are still the best" and some people saying "Humans are worthless now." That's a good thing, I think. It means the difference is small enough that there's a discussion to be had.

Disgusting Oozeling no longer turns the owner green, intentional or bug?

PvP
Weird every Ashran Instance I have joined since 6.2 is 5-10 Horde and 40 or more Alliance. Lots of bots running around too.
Strange. We strictly enforce a 1:1 ratio. Even if a bunch of horde leave, the server gets priority to be filled back to 1:1 holinka 
We look at the realm populations constantly and they are all 1:1. Every single instance of Ashran. holinka 

have the queue times gone done noticeably ? I still get 1-2 hrs on average.
My alliance toon is currently in a 40 min queue. Better but still unacceptable. holinka
