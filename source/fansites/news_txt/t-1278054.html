Heroic Dark Animus 25 Video<br>
We finally have some videos of the Heroic Dark Animus encounter! It took several days for guilds to defeat this encounter, making it the hardest fight so far. Icy Veins has a nice strategy guide (http://www.icy-veins.com/dark-animus-detailed-strategy-wow) if you don&apos;t understand what is going on.<br>

Zandalari Warbringers Hotfix Clarification<br>
Ok, here is clarification from Lead Encounter Designer Ion Hazzikostas (Watcher) regarding the change to Zandalari Warbringers.<br>
<br>
Yes, it&#x2019;s intentional. Zandalari Warscouts are supposed to be difficult solo encounters; you can use various control mechanics on them. <br>
Zandalari Warbringers, however, are designed for groups of players. They&#x2019;re immune to snares and other control effects for the same reason that most 5-player dungeon bosses are: those effects would make the encounter easier than intended. Grab some friends, or invite the people camping the spawn to join your group, and you should be just fine. <br>
<br>
In summary, it is dangerous to go alone. Bringing friends should make taking down a Warbringer much more manageable.<br>
<br>
Was making Horrific Visage uninterruptabale also intended? <br>
Bring a friend with a dispel magic ability to counter Horrific Visage&apos;s fear effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oondasta Spawn Rate Increased<br>
I&apos;d like to have an elite world boss not a rare world boss <br>
Agreed, this is an amazing fight of epic proportions and really tiny arms. We definitely want players to have more chances to experience it. The epicness should be about fighting it, not about finding when it spawns, even though that can also be somewhat fun as long as the timer is not so long that it gets frustrating.<br>
<br>
You should be able to find Mr. &#x201C;Tiny Hands&#x201D; Oondasta a bit more often now. <br>

Secrets of the Empire Drops and Raid Difficulty<br>
It seems like these are awarded randomly per person (LFR style) from normal mode raids. Is this intended? The previous tier had legendary items dropping randomly per person from LFR and to the raid as a whole in normal.<br>
<br>
Has anyone gotten a secret from LFR and Normal/Heroic? It seems as if just like the rep you can only get a shot at a secret once per boss. <br>
Everyone has a personal chance to receive a Secrets of the Empire drop on Normal/Heroic; the quest loot functions the same way that the Raid Finder version of the Legendary quest did prior to 5.2. <br>
<br>
We wanted to have a single shared chance per boss per week because we&apos;d prefer to avoid making raiders who are killing bosses on non-Raid Finder runs to feel obligated to do Raid Finder specifically for Legendary quest drops. If those players want to do it for Valor or off-spec gear, that&#x2019;s great, but doing Raid Finder shouldn&#x2019;t be necessary for optimal Legendary acquisition.

Mandatory Daily Quests<br>
I think one of the issues is not the amount of dailies, but the feeling that they&apos;re mandatory. We don&apos;t have any VP items on the new 5.2 daily reps (not technically true there are a couple, but they&apos;re low enough ilvl as to not feel mandatory for raiders), and we&apos;ll see how that feels for everyone. There&apos;s also not a lot of clarity about what you should be doing to progress in the most efficient way. If you hit 90 today you&apos;d be wise to run some Heroics and only do the 5.1 dailies until you have the ilvl to queue for 5.0 LFR&apos;s, and then progress to 5.2 LFR, and you can probably ignore pretty much everything else. That is, if getting to 5.2 raids is your goal.<br>
<br>
But that&apos;s the important question, what is your goal? Why are you doing all of the dailies? What are you looking to accomplish? If it&apos;s to see the raid content then certainly working on all of the dailies every day is not going to help get you there, or at least not very quickly. And like you said trying to do all of them every day can really eat up a big chunk of time.<br>
<br>
We have a lot of level-cap questing content because there are a lot of people that just like questing, and it&apos;s there and gives some reward for doing it, but if you don&apos;t like that kind of content we don&apos;t want for it to feel mandatory. 5.2 was one step in that direction and if it feels like a good compromise for everyone we can keep going that way. If you want a big shiny dragon, sure you&apos;ll have to spend time on dailies, but it won&apos;t keep you from being able to progress smoothly, or feeling like you&apos;re missing out on an avenue of progression.<br>
<br>
The problem is dailies have become Blizz&apos;s go-to solo pve content for each new content patch.<br>
<br>
5.1, what was the new pve solo content to do? Dailies. 5.2? Dailies. LFD/LFR que&apos;s are so long, you can either sit in town, or do the only new content - dailies. People look forward to the content patches for NEW stuff to do, and when the only option for pve solo content is dailies, of course they will be sick of it. <br>
If we could produce unlimited amounts of content we would, of course, but the laws of physics unfortunately prevent it. Having repeatable questing content gives people who enjoy questing something to do. You&apos;re being unfair by glossing over LFR and dungeons because of queues. If you don&apos;t want to wait for queues you can build your own group and zone into the dungeon, like you did before (and dailies existed then too!), but the fact of the matter is that it&apos;s still more convenient despite the queue times. Or, you could play a tank or healer and spend no time in queues. That&apos;s always an option.<br>
<br>
If you have other solutions I&apos;d be happy to hear them. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257309-my-first-and-my-last-rant-update/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8197653184?page=8#156))<br>

Classes<br>
How likely is it you guys will soon take similar steps across classes? Mists offered simplfied talents; are abilities next?<br>
Great question. We tried to prune abilities for MoP without much success. It&apos;s tough to simplify classes in a game this old. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/311993933867655168))<br>
Don&apos;t want to give everyone a very simple rotation. Would love less action bar bloat, but which stuff to cut is always tough. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/311994130186256386))<br>

Do you ever see the team overhauling hunter aspects to be more fun and compelling?<br>
Overhaul would be unlikely. Cutting them more likely. Not enough design space to make them fun and equal. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/311972381637885952))<br>

before you discover/nerfed stampede bug, u nerfed stampede heals, lynx rush, and bestial wrath. Then silenc shot, powershot.<br>
Yes, all of that is true. A lot of different reasons though. BW was more of a philosophical change not a means to &quot;fix hunters.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/311641826413133825))<br>

If you&apos;re doing less damage than everyone, I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s a warlock issue. Their DPS overall is pretty competitive. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/312356142120574977))<br>
