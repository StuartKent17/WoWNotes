Italian Version of World of Warcraft is Coming to Europe
We have exciting news for our many Italian players: you will soon be able to play WoW in your native language!

Existing players will be able to download a free language pack to experience the game in Italian when it launches later this year.

Gamers in Europe will also be able to purchase fully localized versions of World of Warcraft which now includes its first expansion, The Burning Crusade and its three following expansions, Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm, and the upcoming Mists of Pandaria.

The games will be available for purchase at retail and digitally through your Battle.net account.

Of course, the official World of Warcraft website and forums will be offered in Italian, and weâ€™ll also be opening up Italian realms!

Stay tuned for more information on a release date in the coming months.

A few years ago we noted  that Blizzard was hiring for Italian and Polish positions. There was finally an announcement today regarding the upcoming Italian localization of the game!

This time around Blizzard has added more Polish speaking positions on their employment page  They were also hiring for Turkish speaking positions in the past, though all of those appear to have been filled now. There is a possibility that we will see a Turkish localization in the future, but keep in mind that it took years from the first Italian postings for us to see the localization. 

The Battle.net Mobile Authenticator was updated  was updated recently to add Italian and Polish support. This points to a strong possibility for a Polish localization in the future. However, it is possible they are localizing things other than World of Warcraft, so don't get your hopes up yet! 

Keep in mind that has been no official announcement about any other localizations and the job postings don't mean that other localizations will happen anytime soon, if at all.


Statistics: Insane in the Membrane
Today we take a look at the rate at which people are completing Insane in the Membrane ! The sample size was ~5.6 million level 85 characters with a total of ~11,000 that have the achievement. 

Departing from the way we normally graph the numbers, this graph shows the number of new achievements earned each week, not the total. You can see the big spikes recently caused by the new Darkmoon Faire have boosted the number of people with the achievement. Previously the faire coming to town would cause much smaller spikes.
