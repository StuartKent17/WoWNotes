World of Warcraft 10th Anniversary Ending
The 10th anniversary celebration  is coming to an end soon. You have until Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 10 a.m. PST / Monday, January 5, 2015 at 7 p.m. CET to get anything you may have missed.

If you logged in at all during the event, the Molten Corgi  would have arrived in your mail. A successful run of the 40 player Raid Finder version of Molten Core rewarded a nice Core Hound  mount. The Hatespark the Tiny  pet had a 10% drop rate and the Flames of Ragnaros  weapon enchant transmog had a 2% drop rate  Anyone that killed Ragnaros also got a spec appropriate item level 640 helm

Armory Stats - World of Warcraft 10th Anniversary
We couldn't resist one more graph before the holidays are over and people hopefully return to work! There are 3.7 million characters and 2.4 million accounts that make up this sample. The percentage of players that have both the Alliance and Horde win in Southshore achievement is almost too small to see on the graph 0.01%.

Unsure if this is a bug, but killed The Lanticore in H UBRS and no one in group was able to loot/roll. Did the droprate on the pet change?
Droprates when loot is on Personal are different than when loot is on Group. Muffinus 

This expansion made inventory management worse. Toy box was one step forward and all the new stuff 5 steps back.
What new stuff are you having trouble fitting?
moroes' lucky polish. my inventory is fine save that one item.
Fixed in 6.1 I believe! A few things missed the bus. Muffinus
