When are you planning on updating all of the tooltips that are now wrong?<br>
These require a full client patch, so they&apos;ll be fixed in 6.1. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/545073506333896704))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
.Please make Augment Runes not work in raids.<br>
That&apos;s the point of Augment Runes though... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/545681736567234562))<br>
<br>
Does that mean Blackrock Foundry is a 6.1 raid?<br>
Nah, Foundry is very much 6.0 content - was fully tested as such on beta. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/545708940529377280))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Many players are overly fixated on representation but probably because it is the only metric to look at. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/542705522328494082))<br>
what aught they fixate on, instead?<br>
their own experience playing the game. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/545270832381976576))<br>
