Fangs of the Father - Legendary Daggers Questline Mini-Preview<br>
The patch has only been on the test realms for a few days but we can already find a couple of information on the questline to get the legendary daggers! The quests below are the 4 first quests found in the game files, they will most likely be followed by more of them. <br>
<br>
I also added high resolution screenshots of all 3 stages of the dagger and a 1080p video. <br>

Proving Your Worth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29801/proving-your-worth/)<br>
Objective - Pickpocket a cryptomancer&apos;s decoder ring from a Twilight Sorceror at the Azure Dragonshrine within the Dragon&apos;s Soul raid encounter. <br>
Description - Hello, [name]! You&apos;ve earned a reputation among the flight as having - shall we say - &apos;nimble fingers.&apos; We need someone of your skills for a matter of utmost delicacy. Before I reveal more, we need to know you&apos;re the right [man/woman] for the job. <br>
<br>
When the course of battle takes you to the Azure Dragonshrine, I need you to pickpocket the Twilight Sorcerors until you discover a cryptomancer&apos;s decoder ring. Are you up to the task?<br>
<br>
A Hidden Message (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29802/a-hidden-message/)<br>

Description - Corastrasza, currently stationed at the Vermillion Redoubt in the Twilight Highlands, has intercepted a coded message of grave importance. I&apos;ll let her explain the full situation, but we need your expertise to unravel the cipher! <br>
<br>
Take your decoder ring to an ethereal thurmaturge in your capital city - he should know how to charge it. Acquire the encoded cipher from Corastrasza and use the ring to decode it for her. Hurry! Time is ticking... <br>

Mostrasz will help you infiltrate the compound. Speak to him just outside and fly to Ravenholdt together. Good luck!<br>
