have there been any ideas to make galakras in SoO skippable so we can actually solo it. Much like the valithria encounter in icc<br>
Have you tried it recently? Patch 7.1 should have let you bring the drake down with a single cannon. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/831243393267142658))<br>

No highmountain tribes in over a week yet we&apos;ve had the dreamweavers twice, why is this system so screwed up?<br>
In a system with 7 entries, some fortnights you can have the cycle be ABCDEFG|EDFCGBA, A being Highmountain. Because math. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/831651625609551872))<br>
It would be better to have emissaries set as days to ensure rep dispersion across the factions than having no emissary for a week+<br>
This system already ensures even distribution of all emissaries over time. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/831653735113764864))<br>

Misc<br>
We have riding mounts, flying mounts and swimming ones. Have you guys ever thought about a new type? Climbing? Leaping?<br>
mounts should be able to roll affixes like items, so you can get a leaping white stallion or a vicious frolicking war turtle (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/831179522250649600))<br>

Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
What makes wow the best? What is it about wow that no other MMORPG got right?<br>
The biggest challenge in my mind for MMO design is being able to create stuff for players to do faster than they can consume it.<br>
<br>
Even WoW can&#x2019;t solve that problem completely, but it was the closest I have ever seen. WoW always gave players a ton of things to do. Not only were there dozens of quest zones, but you could actually go do them all without having to find a group first. In previous MMOs, you&#x2019;d hit the point where you&#x2019;re intended to just go slaughter frogs or whatever to gain the next level. WoW never hit those dry points. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, if you did find a group, there were dungeons to run or BGs to jump into. At launch, just looking behind waterfalls or trying to get up cliffs where we weren&#x2019;t supposed to go was fairly entertaining. <br>
<br>
A lot of people, including me, like to point out the ridiculous level of polish that Blizzard puts into games, and I definitely think that is part of WoW&#x2019;s secret sauce. But for me, the reason I kept playing, is that after Redridge, there was Stranglethorn to explore, and after I got tired of my hunter, there as a priest to try, and after I was sick of UBRS, I could try my hand at LBRS. And then I discovered raiding, and whole new ways to play were on the table. And when I wasn&#x2019;t raiding, I needed to farm flasks and Whipper Root Tubers or see if I could get the shield to drop in UBRS. Or I could work on my engineering or I could consider grinding factions. Or I could see if there was any PvP happening around Tyr&#x2019;s Hand. Or try Dire Maul. And just when I was sick of wiping to Naxxramas, an expansion was announced.<br>
<br>
Like a lot of players, my WoW-playing started to shift from just logging on to see what was happening to logging on only for raid nights or the like. But I don&#x2019;t think I would have developed those friendships if I hadn&#x2019;t already been spending so much time in the game before that point.<br>
<br>
I played a lot of games like Civilization, XCOM and Diablo before I discovered WoW, but I felt like I had seen everything there was to see in those games pretty quickly, even though I stuck with them. With WoW, there was always the sense that I was going to discover a new troll ruin or a new rare drop or see some rare spawn for the first time. I also didn&#x2019;t want to miss out if I heard about my friends seeing all of that stuff the one night I chose not to log in.
