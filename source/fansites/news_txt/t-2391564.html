Battle for Azeroth Paladins<br>
After getting used to the Judgement Window and learning how to cram everything into it, I am still glad to see it go<br>
Same honestly. I think it was fun and different but I&apos;m very excited to see how BfA Ret goes.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m super happy as well that Crusade right now is not looking to be the go to talent as I wasn&apos;t a fan of the Crusade burst window. It was fun seeing the numbers but I&apos;m happy overall to see other options in that talent row like Inquisition become more viable when you&apos;re looking at sustained damage versus burst.<br>
<br>
Retribution was very strong in Legion however the BfA changes have the ability to smooth out our weak spots and make things like Crusade not look so dominant and open up playstyles we haven&apos;t had in awhile and I very much welcome that.
