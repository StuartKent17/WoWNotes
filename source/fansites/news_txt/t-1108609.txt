Update: New Zergotchi Authenticator http://eu.blizzard.com/en-gb/games/zergotchi/ announced!
Note: If the Korean site http://www.trywow.co.kr/event/data/2012april/wow/ is any indication, we should be seeing another announcement for WoW soon!

New Zergotchi Authenticator – Blizzard Exclusive
Say goodbye to your dusty old Battle.net Authenticator and hello to its new incarnation: the Zergotchi! Gone are the days when all you had to do was type in a boring six- or eight-digit code to log in to Battle.net or World of Warcraft. Blizzard Entertainment’s newest authentication system takes the next step in both Virtual Pet and Authenticator technology to provide you with the login experience of your life!

Combining a Battle.net Authenticator and a virtual pet into one seamless design, the Zergotchi will not only be an endless source of fun but will also make sure your account stays as secure and safe as ever – in style. Once attached to your Battle.net account, your Zergotchi’s life begins in its vulnerable egg-state. See it hatch! Be there when it evolves from a tiny, creep-spilling larva into a disgustingly cute Zergotchi, and experience the miracle of creation.

Feed it, play with it, care for it, and give it the love it needs to grow into the monster it was meant to be. Even better, it will display a new authentication code every time you ask. Be sure to keep your pet happy, though! If you don’t care for your little friend it will start begging for your attention – and if you let it get unhappy, it’ll start giving you partial authentication codes! Can you guess the missing digits? Yes, your Zergotchi is a playful little character. 

Features

Adds an additional layer of security to your account
Impressive 16-bit display
Grows according to your play-style
Intuitive, user-friendly interface


Countless different critter outcomes
Thanks to a unique piece of Blizzard technology - the Advanced Pattern Recognition Integrated Layer™ - your Zergotchi will be able to determine how often you logged in to which game and played with the different races in order to create your perfect little pet. Playing an orc in World of Warcraft and enjoying some StarCraft II matches as a Terran? Then get ready to meet your little orcish Marine buddy. Or what about an undead Dark Templar? The possibilities are endless!*
*Possibilities are not endless.

Make new friends
But there's more! With its integrated RL Friend Finder Sensoring System, the Zergotchi will bring your gaming experience to the next level. Whenever you’re near someone with a Zergotchi of their own, your little fella will light up and make a noise! What better way to make new in-game and real-life friends than when you are cooing over your little critters together?
