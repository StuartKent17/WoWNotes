Boubouille2008-04-03, 06:26 AMWotLK Beta very soon ?
A nice change has been made to the official site, http://beta.worldofwarcraft.com http://beta.worldofwarcraft.com/ is now working ! Well it's not really working, but it's effectively redirecting people to http://beta.worldofwarcraft.com/game/character-copy.html http://beta.worldofwarcraft.com/game/character-copy.html on the server. Before yesterday it was only showing a 404 error, this could be the sign of an imminent opening of beta signups and it wouldn't be the first time something like this happens, the Wrath of the Lich King website was "detected" a few days before the Blizzcon using the same method.

Frostmourne Replica auction closed - Highest bid reaches $20,700!
A few days ago the Frostmourne Replica Auction http://www.weaponmasters.com/auction/ has been closed, and the two highest bid were respectively ... $20,700 and $20,600 ! The 3rd bid only reached the ridiculous amount of $12,000. I personally find it a bit overpriced for a sword, even if it's Frostmourne, but that's probably because I'm a hunter and I don't really use my melee weapons right ? 

You can see the top 100 bidders on Blizzplanet.com http://blizzplanet.com/news/2256/

US-Proudmoore first realm to reach Phase 3
US-Proudmoore http://us.gorgonnash.info/realm/Proudmoore players are the first to reach the Phase 3 of the offensive on Quel'Danas ! This will let them rebuild the anvil and access the new heroic badges rewards http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=5548.0#post_swisle ! Congratulations to them.
Watching the realm progress and wanted to give a shout out to all the Proudmoorians and their success thus far in taking back Quel'Danas! The Shattered Sun Offensive is surely impressed by your efforts.

02/04 Spotlight - BattleHeat
The focus of our latest World of Warcraft Spotlight is Blacksmithing, not the profession in-game, but one of the oldest crafts and a major cornerstone in building our modern world. While the profession has been around for a long time it still has much to offer us and a small dedicated group of “real life” armor blacksmiths inspired by the World of Warcraft universe were eager to show the community just how much.

We interviewed a member of the German workshop group BattleHeat, and talked about the creation of a paladin armor set, the challenges they face and their ideas for the future. Discover the heat of the battle and the ancient art of blacksmithing!
