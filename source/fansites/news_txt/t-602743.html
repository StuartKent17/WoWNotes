Q: Heroic Keys now requires honored. Is it a bug or a new feature? I didn&apos;t find it on patch&apos;s notes.<br>
A: That&apos;s intended. It was a late change so the patch notes haven&apos;t been updated to reflect it.<br>
<br>
On a side note, the [item=22538] has been changed (Lower City honored instead of Scale of Sands revered)<br>
<br>
Sunwell Plateau<br>
Small update, Tigole seems to post tons of nice things tonight, here is an ETA for the Sunwell Plateau and Sunwell Isle.<br>
Sunwell is coming along nicely. It will be on the PTR shortly after 2.3 goes to the live realms. We still need to perfect 2.3 a bit on the PTR.<br>
<br>
The 5 person dungeon is complete and the 25 person raid instance is progressing nicely. There&apos;s also a cool &quot;public&quot; area featuring brand new daily quests called Sunwell Isle.</div></div>
