Stormwind and Orgrimmar Updates in Battle for Azeroth<br>
Ian Bates (Red Shirt Guy) (https://twitter.com/TheRedShirtGuy) has released a blog post (http://warcraft.blizzplanet.com/blog/comments/updates-stormwind-orgrimmar-battle-azeroth-demo) on Blizzplanet (http://www.blizzplanet.com/) detailing some interesting info from the BfA BlizzCon demo.<br>
<br>
<br>
Each city will now have an embassy linked to the recruitment of Allied Races. <br>
The Orgrimmar embassy resides in what was the Goblin Slums.<br>
The Stormwind embassy is behind the Dwarven District.<br>
Sylvanas Windrunner, Varok Saurfang, Baine Bloodhoof, Lady Liadrin, Rokhan, Lor&#x2019;themar Theron, Trade Prince Gallywix, Ji Firepaw, Eitrigg, and Nathanos Blightcaller reside in the Orgrimmar Embassy. <br>
Saurfang, Baine and Nathanos each have a brand new model.<br>
The Stormwind Embassy contains Anduin Wrynn, Turalyon, Alleria Windrunner, Tyrande Whisperwind, Velen, Genn Greymane, High Tinker Mekkatorque, Muradin Bronzebeard, Aysa Cloudsinger, and Wrathion. <br>
Wrathion isn&apos;t standing next to the others.<br>
When visiting these locations, the faction leaders in both places discuss finding allies for the war and eventually ask you to pick a race to go after. <br>
Currently Horde could only choose between Highmountain Tauren and the Nightborne.<br>
Alliance could select Void Elves or Lightforged Draenei. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Developer Interviews<br>
We&apos;re continuing to take a look at new information from the BlizzCon developer interviews.<br>
<br>
PCGamesN Interview with Ion Hazzikostas<br>
PCGamesN (https://www.pcgamesn.com/world-of-warcraft/wow-patch-735-level-scaling-ulduar-timewalking) was able to sit down with Ion Hazzikostas (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev).<br>
<br>
<br>
The hard modes will be preserved for Ulduar timewalking in 7.3.5.<br>
Vanilla content scales to 60.<br>
Potential to add the old world zones as a Timewalking event.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jessie Cox Interview<br>
Jessie Cox (https://twitter.com/JesseCox) sat down on the show floor with Ion Hazzikostas.<br>

<br>
<br>
Vol&#x2019;jin&#x2019;s physical manifestation is dead, but we likely haven&#x2019;t seen the last of his spirit.<br>
Thrall may have Vol&#x2019;jin&#x2019;s urn.<br>
Minute one of the new expansion takes place right after the cinematic.<br>
Allied races fit with the theme of this expansion.<br>
Warfronts are &#x201C;raid vs army&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;raid vs giant boss.&#x201D;<br>
Heavily built up faction hubs in BfA<br>
High Elves are pretty much Blood Elves and so it&#x2019;s unlikely they will be a playable race.<br>
No third faction is planned<br>
Uldir is a traditional troll raid with slight Old God/Titan themes.<br>
No plans for account bound item stash right now but it&#x2019;s a good idea, especially for crafting materials.<br>
Gear slots affected by the Heart of Azeroth (head, shoulder, chest) will not Warforge/Titanforge.<br>
The patch cycle will be similar to Legion.<br>
A separate team is doing World of Warcraft: Classic.<br>
World of Wacraft: Classic will take a lot of community feedback.<br>
Pacing and requirements to unlocking flying are subject to tweaks.<br>
Kezan is not currently planned to be more than a dungeon.<br>
There are no current plans for Gnome Paladins.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rolling Stone Interview<br>
Rolling Stones (http://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/battle-of-azeroth-wow-game-director-discusses-expansions-w511011) talked to the WoW Devs.<br>
<br>
<br>
The team likes the story to flow from one expansion to the next instead of in previous ones where a completely different story popped up between each of them.<br>
The team wants to give something to every playstyle in every expansion.<br>
BfA is more about the story and improving systems rather than making major gameplay changes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Polygon Interview with WoW Devs<br>
Polygon (https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/3/16597166/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth-news-features-reveal-wow-new-expansion) sat down with the WoW Devs.<br>
<br>
<br>
Void elves will have a short-range teleport as a racial.<br>
The team is thinking about bringing the faction conflict into dungeons and raids.<br>
BfA is also about the world dying beneath our feet.<br>
Progression of the Heart of Azeroth is not spec specific like the artifact weapons.<br>
<br>
<br>
DigitalTrends Interview with Muffinus<br>
Digtaltrends (https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth-interview/) interviewed Jeremy Feasel. (AKA Muffinus)<br>
<br>
<br>
Warfronts let you contribute to victory in any way you want. You can focus on combat while someone else can go chop wood or mine ore.<br>
Existing characters are now front and center to the story.<br>
<br>
<br>
Blizzplanet Interview<br>
Blizzplanet (http://warcraft.blizzplanet.com/blog/comments/blizzcon-2017-jeremy-feasel-interview-world-warcraft-battle-azeroth) sat down with Muffinus as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zhU9AvMlAQM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
You will have to finish Legion to figure out Illidan&#x2019;s future.<br>
Bwonsamdi (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Bwonsamdi) (the Loa of death) plays a major role in Zandalar.<br>
Blood Trolls (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Blood_troll) are under the servitude of a powerful new creature that you will meet in the very first raid of this expansion.<br>
Uldir (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Uldir) only has one of its three seals remaining on it. During the course of the expansion, you are going to find out what happens to that last seal.<br>
Drust (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Drust) people were a society wiped out in Drustvar (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Drustvar) that now exists as spirits trying to work their way back into the world.<br>
Another random event in Warfronts could be major figures such as Jaina showing up and rallying the raid to help her fight to take over a point.<br>
<br>
<br>
Vanion Interview with Muffinus<br>
Vanion (http://www.vanion.eu/news/battle-for-azeroth-interview-mit-jeremy-feasel-viel-lore-und-spoiler-17370) also interviewed Muffinus.<br>
<br>
<br>
The ending cinematic to Antorus is epic and will answer a lot of lingering questions while raising new ones.<br>
<br>
<br>
GameSpot Interviews John Height<br>
GameSpot (https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wows-battle-for-azeroth-expansion-might-be-the-bes/1100-6454665/) interviews John Height.<br>
<br>
<br>
The burning of Teldrassil is the event that causes the Alliance to lay siege to the Undercity.<br>
Anduin&#x2019;s moment in the cinematic is him realizing what he is really about, healing over fighting.<br>
BfA is a more personal story instead of a &#x201C;big bad&#x201D; one.<br>
There will still be zones that are 1-20 to get new players acclimated.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hotted &amp; Asmongold Interview<br>
Hotted (https://twitter.com/hotted89) and Asmongold (https://twitter.com/Asmongold) also did an interview.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FOkw1BSzBKI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
No plans for more solo challenge content like the mage tower in BfA but it&#x2019;s definitely a possibility.<br>
New World PVP systems should even out Horde and Alliance on PVP shards.<br>
Small revamps to existing PVP talents to keep rotations similar between PVE and PVP.<br>
Team is talking about adding Mythic + to old world dungeons, but not yet planned for BfA.<br>
No current plans for Mythic + raids.<br>
4 difficulty options for raids will continue in BfA.<br>
No change to mythic raid size.<br>
Not looking to add a ton of new abilities to classes, but this could change.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeff Kaplan Weighs in on World of Warcraft: Classic<br>
Jeff Kaplan was asked about classic WoW servers by r/overwatch (https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7bdyby/blizzcon_2017_interview_jeff_kaplan_bill_warnecke/). Here is a quick recap:<br>
<br>
<br>
Thinks it&apos;s a great idea.<br>
It&apos;s the sense of community that made classic WoW great.<br>
Lack of systems such as server transfer led to building a reputation, good or bad, on your server.<br>
It was not the quests he designed that made the game great.<br>
Game design isn&apos;t black and white. Players need to also look at what they are giving up when asking for things.<br>
