A wild Patch 4.2.2 appeared on the test realms download servers a couple of hours ago, and it looks like we&apos;ll go through a bugfix patch before we get to see Patch 4.3.<br>
<br>
<br>
Important - Most of these changes are nothing more than tooltip fixes to reflect Patch 4.2 Hotfixes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/183042/patch-42-hotfixes) already active on live servers. I&apos;m mostly documenting them for the sake of it.<br>
