Pet Battle Bonus Event &#x2013; December 30 - January 4<br>
Through Monday, January 4, Pet Battle experience gains are increased by +200%. There&#x2019;s never been a better time to get out there and level up your mighty minions!<br>
<br>
Before you head out into the wild with your lower-level wild things, make sure you pick up the quest &#x201C;The Very Best&#x201D;. Because you&#x2019;re the best &#x2013; around &#x2013; you&#x2019;ll want to queue up for PvP Pet Battles with a team of three level-25 pets. After only five wins during the event, you&#x2019;ll be rewarded with an Ultimate Battle-Training Stone, which means another level 25 is on its way to your collection.<br>

One of the things I love is Highmountain quests divided in questlines like the Divine Bell achv<br>
Yeah, we prefer that format too. I&apos;d expect to see that for the other zones a bit further down the line. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/681232411808546816))<br>
