Level 1 Heirloom Mount<br>
Collecting all heirloom items awards a special mount usable by level 1 characters.<br>
<br>
Does this mean we need the fishing event BoA for this mount? When I won it I took the trinket that turns you into a fish.<br>
I&apos;ve asked about that and was informed that the achievement involves collecting a number of heirlooms (not all of them). Working on getting clarification on the Heirloom collections tab and will be updating the 6.1 PTR Patch Notes with more concrete information once it&apos;s available.

Ashran Timing Hotfix<br>
As you&apos;ve probably witnessed, on many servers Ashran had digressed into a situation where the two factions were avoiding any confrontation. One faction would complete the outer events while the other faction would kill the faction leader. This isn&apos;t ideal, as the Horde and Alliance should be fighting more regularly in Ashran. <br>
<br>
Recently, we made changes to the frequency of events and the time between battles in the middle road. After a boss is killed, the center lane will take 30 minutes to reset. We hope this encourages the team that just won the middle lane to venture off into the rest of the zone for a time before the fight begins anew. Furthermore, we hope that faction&#x2019;s presence in the outer events will encourage the other faction to fight in the center lane a bit more, since winning the events is no longer a given.<br>
<br>
We&apos;ll continue to consider your constructive Ashran feedback and appreciate those of you providing it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/359433-2nd-blizzard-hotfix-without-warning/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16016273468?page=2#34))</div></div>
