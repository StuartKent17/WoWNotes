<br>
Talents<br>
<br>
The Dream of Cenarius effect is now removed when the Druid switches talents.<br>
<br>

Protection Paladins are now eligible to receive plate armor with Haste via person loot (Raid Finder and Flexible difficulty) and bonus rolls (all difficulty modes) from Siege of Orgrimmar and Ordos.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br>
<br>
Siege of Orgrimmar<br>
<br>
Norushen<br>
<br>
The number of Look Within orbs spawned by Norushen in Flexible difficulty will now round up instead of down, so that the ratio of orbs to players is never worse than on Normal difficulty.<br>
<br>
Galakras<br>
<br>
The portal leading back to the Vault of Y&apos;Shaarj can no longer be used while in combat.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Battlegrounds and Arenas<br>
<br>
Arenas<br>
<br>
[Requires a realm restart.] The Crowd Chose You has been removed and replaced with a debuff called Dampening.<br>
[Requires a realm restart.] For Arena matches that last more than 10 minutes, all players in the Arena will begin to receive Dampening.<br>
<br>
Dampening is a stacking debuff applied to all players in the Arena every 10 seconds.<br>
Each stack of Dampening reduces all healing and damage absorption by 1%.<br>
If neither team has won after 20 minutes, the Arena match will end in a draw.<br>
Necrotic Strike&apos;s healing absorption is not affected by Dampening.</div></div>
