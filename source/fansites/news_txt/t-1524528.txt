Warlords of Draenor - Tier 17 Rogue Armor Sets
Today we are taking a look at the Rogue Tier 17 armor sets. Unfortunately the Mythic set is missing shoulders, but the other two sets are complete.

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/us-en.png Free Faction Changes for Select Realms
It looks like Blizzard is ready to try something new to address long battleground queues, starting with a test on US-Barthilas. 

As it stands, Barthilas has roughly 18.6k players with a Level 90 character on the realm. Around 14.7k of those characters are Horde and 3.9k are Alliance, resulting in a population that is 21% Alliance and 79% Horde.

Looking at characters rather than players, there are ~41.7k Level 90 characters on Barthilas now, with 34.3k Horde and 7.4k Alliance, for a 17.8% Alliance and 82.2% Horde population.

Holinka https://twitter.com/holinka also answered some common questions about the transfers on Twitter, noting that this isn't intended to solve the faction imbalance problem on many realms. 

Something to keep in mind about free faction transfers: The primary objective is to balance faction populations at the region level. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469164643781316608
Nice little attempt to give players corrective abilities to balance their own realms. Good luck on Mal'Ganis...
Again, the intention isn't to correct realm imbalances, but region imbalance. It's unlikely Tichondrius would become 50/50. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469184533573533697
Do you think starting with smaller realms to balance the regional overflow not wanting ques would work?
We're starting with one server to ensure we can be responsive if anything unexpected occurs. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469191766793416706
What if you don't get good results? Will you try another server? And thank you for listening to us 
if things go well we will expand to other realms and regions. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469207846815428608
My question was if they don't go as expected on that one server, will you still try another?
We started with one server to evaluate the process not player response. If the process works properly we will expand it. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469214322053230592

what is the incentive though? why would anyone at this time choose to go to the side that lower pop, and lesser racial abilities?
We're trying to remove barriers first. People faction transfer all the time. They may not need added incentive. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469167563536990208

So horde->alliance is probably all we are going to see initially?
Yes holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469165044836466689

but what about when all the alliance go horde like they've slowly been doing since faction change was implemented
We aren't offering alliance to horde transfers for free. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469165237036277762
how is that helping to solve the alliance dominance on my server then? Horde is dead on my server ..
it isn't meant to fix that problem holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469207711050383360

I wonder why they started with Barth? are we the guinea pig server? but I am excited. Ashran!!
It was a good size and had a horde/alliance ratio we thought might attract faction changes. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469287666194726912


We consistently watch queue times for all areas of the game to try to identify problem areas where we can step in and make an improvement. Battleground queue times specifically tend to be a direct result of how many people are entering the queue at any given time from both the Horde and Alliance, within an entire region. While a number of factors can lead to longer queue times, faction interest in queuing for PvP tends to be the primary influence. For that reason we're going to be trying something new. For a limited time, and only for select realms for this first test just a single realm, we'll be opening faction changes for Horde characters to change to Alliance for free.

These changes will be provided on a limited basis to realms where we see the greatest potential for changes to occur. Guild leaders who want to Faction Change their guild for free will first need to pay for the initial transaction, but will be granted a refund* if they change to the eligible faction within the free change time frame.

This first test of free faction changes will only initially be available to players on Barthilas. Eligible characters will be able to faction change from Horde to Alliance for approximately** one week beginning on Tuesday, May 27. If you're looking to faction change--and especially for any Guild leaders looking to initiate a Guild Master Faction Change https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/guild-master-realm-transfer-faction-change-procedure--we highly recommend taking advantage of this offer as soon as possible to avoid leaving anyone behind. For more information on Faction Change eligibility and limitations, please visit the support site here https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/faction-change-basics-eligibility-and-limitations.

We'll be providing updates on availability--as well as if this offer is extended to additional realms--here on the front page, so keep checking back. We look forward to your feedback on these faction changes, and ensuring you spend less time in a queue and more time slaughtering your enemies in glorious team-combat.

* Eligible Guild Master Faction Change refunds will be automatically processed within 72 hours.
**Faction Change availability may either be shortened or extended depending on ongoing evaluation during the faction change period.

Isn't a talent that denies another talent bad design?
The problem is when one talent mandates another. It's OK if *occasionally* two talents are incompatible. Still a choice. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467990817945051138
How is that a choice? I have the choice to pick a incompatible talent? ... not a choice at all
I think you may have misread. The point is that you do still have a choice, between the other two talents. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467997723321331713
what if 2 or all 3 talents are penalized/incompatible/defeat the purpose? You have only 1 remaining.. or none
Then that's a problem, as I said. We try to never do that. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468001738801172481
and 75 talents, if you are not a BM hunter, you dont want any of that as its tuned around BM mastery.
That's... not actually true, you realize? It doesn't matter if a row is stronger for one spec; row is still balanced. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468007886291861504

So Army is losing its Defensive properties then with it being instant or will blood gain a small defensive boost for short time?
No; the 4sec of damage reduction is remaining. Yes, that's a buff, since it's no longer in lieu of being able to dodge/parry. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467820854563196928

BT Is the only option now in that tier and that is also passive as most people just macro it. That tier is illusion of choice.
Are you a PvP-oriented Unholy DK? For every other combo that tier has some of the most talent diversity. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468572025510830080
I'm a PvE raider. Every DW DK runs BT, 2H runs RE and so on. No choice there for PvE. Sorry I'm just not seeing choice there
Of Frost DKs who killed a boss in N/H SoO last week, here is the T5 talent breakdown: 43.93%, 29.81%, 26.26%. Guess which is which? WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468576674385121281
The point here is that different people can view choice differently. Sometimes each might think theirs is the only "right" answer. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468577239391404032
I agree. The 43% is obviously BT, the other two are way low meaning they need help. Just spice them up so aren't so boring.
The 43.93% is actually Runic Empowerment. Go figure, right? BT pulls ahead if you look at Heroic exclusively, but it's still close. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468580214000189440
Can you see whats chose for raids or just "who killed a boss" & "what they have now" independently? I switch for raids
The former - can look at it boss-by-boss, or for BGs, or arenas, etc. As you say, it wouldn't be accurate otherwise. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468585751475539969

Will AMZ stay a talent for dks, when all other minor raid cooldowns are given to classes baseline?
There are many talented forms of raid utility. It's actually a benefit to the class to be able to trade it for something... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468583999909031936
...else in the situation that it's not particularly useful. There are several talented raid utility abilities. Examples: ... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468584199633371136
Nature's Vigil, Heart of the Wild, Ancestral Guidance, Hand of Purity, Clemency, Sacred Shield, Safeguard, Vigilance, etc. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468584610100543489
But then blood gets it, I thought you were removing all raid cds from tanks.
A very fair question. We've not reduced tanks to zero, just as much as we can without hitting talents. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468586993069215744
AMZ is more a raid CD than those types of utility though
It's no more of a raid CD than Nature's Vigil or Chi Burst or Ancestral Guidance, etc. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468587517998923776
Er, you might not have intended it that way but it's very much viewed and assessed as a raid CD by DKs today.
Er, I'm agreeing that it's a raid CD. And pointing out that there are many talented raid CDs; it's not unique in that regard. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468643181848825857

...Blood DKs feel that Purgatory is a must since it acts as a cheat death. That's huge for a spec like Blood.
And AMZ isn't valuable during progression? It depends upon the fight; in many cases AMZ is better. Lichborne too Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468647401012465664
If you're seeing any DPS/Tank DKs take Lichborne widely in PvE, I'd be very interested in hearing about it.
I was referring to the 6.0 version of Lichborne. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468648158113718272
One quick question- is 6.0 Lichborne still a CD, or does the Leech have a passive component?
Still 2min CD. I believe it's 15% Leech, offhand. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468652327553871872

If RoP is superior to MI or IF, we have to use it. Just like LB > NT for single target now, even if I hate LB I have to use it.

For all difficulties - a Mythic raid will be treated the same as a 20-player Normal/Heroic raid. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/467736988964376576

Kind of puzzled at the LFR Garrosh timer increase as opposed to a health reduction. 18+ minute LFR fight is a little long, no?
Vast majority of LFR Garrosh kills are well short of that, but if you made it that far, a sub-10% zerk wipe is the worst thing. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468780542520197120

PvP
Thoughts about honor from bgs after the buff? It still feels like it's WAY too little honor for how much you need on a new toon.
Dunno, just geared up a toon and felt really fast holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/467328162762747904
Sounds like you have alot of toons Holinka, trying all classes?
yup holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/467328935726809088

Are there any plans to change fear in WoD? I'm tired of it not breaking and I die in it
they're 2 seconds shorter holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/467379282507886593

Thoughts on Flex RBGs? Would help my guild, but I can understand balance concerns.
Flex is a great idea for PvE content. Fixed size is pretty necessary for PvP. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/468772809926520832

What's your opinion on "Prideful Conquest" being account-wide. The catch up is brutal for most people.
I've done the catchup myself through pugs several times. I think it works great. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/468772621899689984
And then you're still behind on gear.
The intention isn't to catch all the way up. Playing consistently should have an advantage. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/468773797877665792
I guess you're right. I guess I'm just the minority that feels rated PvP shouldn't be an uneven playing field.
there others with that opinion. I think WoW strikes a good balance. There is progression but fairly easy to get to full gear. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/468777869561184256

UI / Addons
Random question, but is there a particular reason that there is no cooldown text on action bar buttons by default?
It's an option in 6.0. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468630422134349824

Warlords of Draenor
Will we ever see better in game testing tools? Even better/more target dummy options would be REALLY nice.
We're working on some options for alpha/beta, but nothing I can promise. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468705495591579648
