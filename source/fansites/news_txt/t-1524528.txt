Warlords of Draenor - Tier 17 Rogue Armor Sets
Today we are taking a look at the Rogue Tier 17 armor sets. Unfortunately the Mythic set is missing shoulders, but the other two sets are complete.

 Free Faction Changes for Select Realms
It looks like Blizzard is ready to try something new to address long battleground queues, starting with a test on US-Barthilas. 

As it stands, Barthilas has roughly 18.6k players with a Level 90 character on the realm. Around 14.7k of those characters are Horde and 3.9k are Alliance, resulting in a population that is 21% Alliance and 79% Horde.

Looking at characters rather than players, there are ~41.7k Level 90 characters on Barthilas now, with 34.3k Horde and 7.4k Alliance, for a 17.8% Alliance and 82.2% Horde population.

Holinka  also answered some common questions about the transfers on Twitter, noting that this isn't intended to solve the faction imbalance problem on many realms. 

Something to keep in mind about free faction transfers: The primary objective is to balance faction populations at the region level. holinka 
Nice little attempt to give players corrective abilities to balance their own realms. Good luck on Mal'Ganis...
Again, the intention isn't to correct realm imbalances, but region imbalance. It's unlikely Tichondrius would become 50/50. holinka 
Do you think starting with smaller realms to balance the regional overflow not wanting ques would work?
We're starting with one server to ensure we can be responsive if anything unexpected occurs. holinka 
What if you don't get good results? Will you try another server? And thank you for listening to us 
if things go well we will expand to other realms and regions. holinka 
My question was if they don't go as expected on that one server, will you still try another?
We started with one server to evaluate the process not player response. If the process works properly we will expand it. holinka 

what is the incentive though? why would anyone at this time choose to go to the side that lower pop, and lesser racial abilities?
We're trying to remove barriers first. People faction transfer all the time. They may not need added incentive. holinka 

So horde->alliance is probably all we are going to see initially?
Yes holinka 

but what about when all the alliance go horde like they've slowly been doing since faction change was implemented
We aren't offering alliance to horde transfers for free. holinka 
how is that helping to solve the alliance dominance on my server then? Horde is dead on my server ..
it isn't meant to fix that problem holinka 

I wonder why they started with Barth? are we the guinea pig server? but I am excited. Ashran!!
It was a good size and had a horde/alliance ratio we thought might attract faction changes. holinka 


We consistently watch queue times for all areas of the game to try to identify problem areas where we can step in and make an improvement. Battleground queue times specifically tend to be a direct result of how many people are entering the queue at any given time from both the Horde and Alliance, within an entire region. While a number of factors can lead to longer queue times, faction interest in queuing for PvP tends to be the primary influence. For that reason we're going to be trying something new. For a limited time, and only for select realms for this first test just a single realm, we'll be opening faction changes for Horde characters to change to Alliance for free.

These changes will be provided on a limited basis to realms where we see the greatest potential for changes to occur. Guild leaders who want to Faction Change their guild for free will first need to pay for the initial transaction, but will be granted a refund* if they change to the eligible faction within the free change time frame.

This first test of free faction changes will only initially be available to players on Barthilas. Eligible characters will be able to faction change from Horde to Alliance for approximately** one week beginning on Tuesday, May 27. If you're looking to faction change--and especially for any Guild leaders looking to initiate a Guild Master Faction Change  highly recommend taking advantage of this offer as soon as possible to avoid leaving anyone behind. For more information on Faction Change eligibility and limitations, please visit the support site here 

We'll be providing updates on availability--as well as if this offer is extended to additional realms--here on the front page, so keep checking back. We look forward to your feedback on these faction changes, and ensuring you spend less time in a queue and more time slaughtering your enemies in glorious team-combat.

* Eligible Guild Master Faction Change refunds will be automatically processed within 72 hours.
**Faction Change availability may either be shortened or extended depending on ongoing evaluation during the faction change period.

Isn't a talent that denies another talent bad design?
The problem is when one talent mandates another. It's OK if *occasionally* two talents are incompatible. Still a choice. Celestalon 
How is that a choice? I have the choice to pick a incompatible talent? ... not a choice at all
I think you may have misread. The point is that you do still have a choice, between the other two talents. Celestalon 
what if 2 or all 3 talents are penalized/incompatible/defeat the purpose? You have only 1 remaining.. or none
Then that's a problem, as I said. We try to never do that. Celestalon 
and 75 talents, if you are not a BM hunter, you dont want any of that as its tuned around BM mastery.
That's... not actually true, you realize? It doesn't matter if a row is stronger for one spec; row is still balanced. Celestalon 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
So Army is losing its Defensive properties then with it being instant or will blood gain a small defensive boost for short time?
No; the 4sec of damage reduction is remaining. Yes, that's a buff, since it's no longer in lieu of being able to dodge/parry. Celestalon 

BT Is the only option now in that tier and that is also passive as most people just macro it. That tier is illusion of choice.
Are you a PvP-oriented Unholy DK? For every other combo that tier has some of the most talent diversity. WatcherDev 
I'm a PvE raider. Every DW DK runs BT, 2H runs RE and so on. No choice there for PvE. Sorry I'm just not seeing choice there
Of Frost DKs who killed a boss in N/H SoO last week, here is the T5 talent breakdown: 43.93%, 29.81%, 26.26%. Guess which is which? WatcherDev 
The point here is that different people can view choice differently. Sometimes each might think theirs is the only "right" answer. WatcherDev 
I agree. The 43% is obviously BT, the other two are way low meaning they need help. Just spice them up so aren't so boring.
The 43.93% is actually Runic Empowerment. Go figure, right? BT pulls ahead if you look at Heroic exclusively, but it's still close. WatcherDev 
Can you see whats chose for raids or just "who killed a boss" & "what they have now" independently? I switch for raids
The former - can look at it boss-by-boss, or for BGs, or arenas, etc. As you say, it wouldn't be accurate otherwise. WatcherDev 

Will AMZ stay a talent for dks, when all other minor raid cooldowns are given to classes baseline?
There are many talented forms of raid utility. It's actually a benefit to the class to be able to trade it for something... Celestalon 
...else in the situation that it's not particularly useful. There are several talented raid utility abilities. Examples: ... Celestalon 
Nature's Vigil, Heart of the Wild, Ancestral Guidance, Hand of Purity, Clemency, Sacred Shield, Safeguard, Vigilance, etc. Celestalon 
But then blood gets it, I thought you were removing all raid cds from tanks.
A very fair question. We've not reduced tanks to zero, just as much as we can without hitting talents. Celestalon 
AMZ is more a raid CD than those types of utility though
It's no more of a raid CD than Nature's Vigil or Chi Burst or Ancestral Guidance, etc. Celestalon 
Er, you might not have intended it that way but it's very much viewed and assessed as a raid CD by DKs today.
Er, I'm agreeing that it's a raid CD. And pointing out that there are many talented raid CDs; it's not unique in that regard. Celestalon 

...Blood DKs feel that Purgatory is a must since it acts as a cheat death. That's huge for a spec like Blood.
And AMZ isn't valuable during progression? It depends upon the fight; in many cases AMZ is better. Lichborne too Celestalon 
If you're seeing any DPS/Tank DKs take Lichborne widely in PvE, I'd be very interested in hearing about it.
I was referring to the 6.0 version of Lichborne. Celestalon 
One quick question- is 6.0 Lichborne still a CD, or does the Leech have a passive component?
Still 2min CD. I believe it's 15% Leech, offhand. Celestalon 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
As a feral druid, I don't want to have to be healing people. I want to do damage. Not every druid wants to be a hybrid healer.
That's totally fine; we're providing options to do just that playstyle. Celestalon 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Hunters also have no stackable raid utility, will we be getting one in WoD?
Yes. We're working on solving that problem. Celestalon 

Would it ever be possible for hunters to have a version of Xuen to tame? Have pined for one since model reveal...
Feels like it would be taking away from monk's summon. Muffinus 

Can you make Bombardment dmg modifier baked in and not a proc? sometimes you don't have time for another Multi-Shot
That's the challenge and skill-check involved in doing well at AoE with Marksmanship. Celestalon 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Thanks for forcing RoP on us for some progression fights. I'm so excited to hate playing my class.
No idea where this is suddenly coming from, but you can help spread the word that it's not the case. Celestalon 
If RoP is superior to MI or IF, we have to use it. Just like LB > NT for single target now, even if I hate LB I have to use it.
Extremely different situations. LB was fully intended to be better than NT for single target. RoP is not in that situation. Celestalon 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Will Crane Stance see new/unique attack animations, or just use Serpent Stance's?
Crane Stance will use the same animations as Tiger Stance. Celestalon 

Chi Explotion replaces Blackout Kick? Do Chi Explotion do damage in crane stance then? Worried about my solo abilities.
Yes. Celestalon 

would it be possible to have Storm, Earth, and Fire, put a debuff on the mobs they are focused to prevent attacking the same one
Yep. Celestalon 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Can Glyph of Holy Nova become Shadow Nova for Spriests? Shadow has no AoE before 75 while leveling, it would help a lot! 
I believe we're removing the glyph. We may rebuild the levels you get spells at; Mind Sear could prolly be lower level. Celestalon 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Hello. For Assassination it's seemingly better to spread Rupture around than using Crimson Tempest. Will this change in WoD?
Yeah, this is a problem we're working on solving. Not sure if we've gone far enough yet, but already significant buff via Perks. Celestalon 
Will "Death from Above" profit from Sub Mastery and Revealing Strike? How will it be balanced for Mut against Envenom?
We're working on a tweak to it to solve that concern, actually. Looking like we'll have it do an Envenom/Eviscerate on land. Celestalon 
instead of the weapon strike Celestalon 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
any plans to add a ranged component to lava lash during ascendance? It's a serious quality of life issue for enhancement shamans
No; it's intentional that you do "nearly 100%" of your damage from ranged, not "fully 100%", with Ascendance. That's so... Celestalon 
...that you care more about how it fits into your rotation, and more importantly, so that you still prefer to be in melee. Celestalon 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
whats the reasoning for the warrior talent change: Storm Bolt replacing Blade Storm in the line up? is it just for pvp balance?
We feel the talent grouping makes more sense. It puts DPS cooldowns together and CC abilities together. holinka 

Glyph of Unending Rage is very powerful for all War Specs and near mandatory. Happy with req Glyph or chance of making baseline?
Worth considering, but how mandatory it is may significantly change in WoD; waiting to see. Regardless "Mandatory->Baseline"... Celestalon 
...is generally a thought process that glosses over the fact that that's a net buff to the class. Easy mistake to make. Celestalon 
Wtb hints on arms changes
Hint: Less complexity. More depth. Celestalon 
I call foul, you gave us that hint already a few days ago. Give us a new hint!
Wouldn't it be cool if you had a Mastery that accentuated your spec's flavor, instead of fought against it? Celestalon 

Will prot mastery benefit gladiator stance at all?
Yes; mastery grants +%AP for tanks. Celestalon 
About this, will Mastery's AP scaling for tanks be tuned differently for each tank?
If needbe. So far, no, but we haven't fine-tuned performance yet. Celestalon 

Art
Do you think we can have full spell effects out in the world and only diminish them in raid environments?
That's the plan other than in large concentrations of players even outdoors, such as Ashran. Celestalon 

Character / Items
What was the reasoning behind necks, rings, and cloaks not changing stats in 6.0? I get how weapons and trinkets have a ...
It's good for loot distribution, competition, variety, and interest, for different items to be valuable to different people. Celestalon 
Had they changed stats, a given ring would be useful to everyone of a role. Rings that 2/3 of the raid rolls on... CC: @olandgren Celestalon 

Is there any intention to help alts with upgrades? Will take 4 months to upgrade a full gearset with a weekly 1k valor cap.
The increase is mainly to let already-capped players continue progressing. If your gear is unupgraded you don't have that issue. WatcherDev 

Warlords of Draenor Stats
With the upcoming stat squish, will we feel weaker when soloing old raid content compared to how it is now?
No, not at all. Celestalon 

You mentioned that necks, ring etc with spirit will be useless for dps in 6.0. Same for mail gear? Will be super annoying as ele
Nope. Mail gear will not have Spirit on it. Celestalon 

will secondary stats weigh equally for each spec so we can stack what we think is more fun, not which is "more dps"?
We don't aim for perfect equality and that that's not even feasible most of the time. But, we are aiming for much closer. Celestalon 

Can trinket procs or weapon enchants multi-strike? Or is multi-strike focused on player abilties.
If you're referring to ones that do damage, such as Elemental Force, yes, the damage can Multistrike. Celestalon 
However something like Jade Spirit cannot. Celestalon 

PvE
Is the new recharging rez system for flexible difficulties only or mythic too?
For all difficulties - a Mythic raid will be treated the same as a 20-player Normal/Heroic raid. WatcherDev 

Kind of puzzled at the LFR Garrosh timer increase as opposed to a health reduction. 18+ minute LFR fight is a little long, no?
Vast majority of LFR Garrosh kills are well short of that, but if you made it that far, a sub-10% zerk wipe is the worst thing. WatcherDev 

PvP
Thoughts about honor from bgs after the buff? It still feels like it's WAY too little honor for how much you need on a new toon.
Dunno, just geared up a toon and felt really fast holinka 
Sounds like you have alot of toons Holinka, trying all classes?
yup holinka 

Are there any plans to change fear in WoD? I'm tired of it not breaking and I die in it
they're 2 seconds shorter holinka 

Thoughts on Flex RBGs? Would help my guild, but I can understand balance concerns.
Flex is a great idea for PvE content. Fixed size is pretty necessary for PvP. holinka 

What's your opinion on "Prideful Conquest" being account-wide. The catch up is brutal for most people.
I've done the catchup myself through pugs several times. I think it works great. holinka 
And then you're still behind on gear.
The intention isn't to catch all the way up. Playing consistently should have an advantage. holinka 
I guess you're right. I guess I'm just the minority that feels rated PvP shouldn't be an uneven playing field.
there others with that opinion. I think WoW strikes a good balance. There is progression but fairly easy to get to full gear. holinka 

UI / Addons
Random question, but is there a particular reason that there is no cooldown text on action bar buttons by default?
It's an option in 6.0. Celestalon 

Warlords of Draenor
Will we ever see better in game testing tools? Even better/more target dummy options would be REALLY nice.
We're working on some options for alpha/beta, but nothing I can promise. Celestalon
