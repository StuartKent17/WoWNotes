Armory Stats - Battleground Win Ratios<br>
Today we are taking a look at the win percentage for each faction and battleground that took place in the last month. To find these numbers, we compared the number of battles and victories a character had in a February snapshot of data to a March snapshot of data.<br>
<br>
These numbers come from a character&apos;s statistics pane, so any bugs with character statistics will have skewed the results. This means that there isn&apos;t any way for us to verify how accurate these numbers are, so do not take them as fact.<br>
<br>
Percentages came fairly close to 100% in most cases, so we normalized the data to 100%. Unfortunately it seems that most Eye of the Storm wins are still not recorded in your statistics most of the time. This bug has been around for five or more years now, but we normalized the data we had (~7.5% and ~9.7% win ratios for each faction) for the chart.<br>
<br>
The data used today is a sample made up of ~8.6 million level 90 characters and ~10 million battles. The sample is slightly biased, as players who are not in a guild are less likely to appear in our sample.<br>
<br>
You can see the data from the last time we did this back in January (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3707-Battleground-Win-Ratios-Upcoming-SoO-Changes-Feedback-Blue-Tweets-DLC-424).<br>
<br>
The major change to note this time is the increase of Horde wins Alterac Valley. You may recall that Patch 5.4.7 changed some things around the Horde base (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3771-Patch-5-4-7-Official-Notes-Blue-Tweets-Patch-5-4-7-Alterac-Valley-Map-Changes). <br>
<br>
<br>
December 2013 to January 2014 - Horde won 21.8% of Alterac Valley games.<br>
January to February 2014 - Horde won 20.6% of Alterac Valley games.<br>
February to March 2014 - Horde won 27% of Alterac Valley games.<br>
February to March 2014 - ~10% of players took part in at least 1 Alterac Valley game.<br>

Battleground Queue Times<br>
Holinka also shared (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449573793019604992) something interesting about blacklisting recently, mentioning that the majority of people aren&apos;t using the blacklist function. <br>

PvP<br>
I really want to play and gear my Horde alt, but every time I see a 17 min random BG queue I die a little inside. Any plans to fix?<br>
Yes we have some things we&apos;re working on. More to come soon. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/445452919098191872))<br>
<br>
&quot;what would it take for Horde PvP players to switch to Alliance?&quot; having faction change be FREE would be a mandatory start.<br>
We certainly agree that removing that barrier in certain cases would help. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/447453472258945025))<br>
<br>
Should give low level battle ground queues satchels of armor (and maybe gold) like dungeons<br>
That&apos;s the plan for warlords because @nite_moogle is awesome (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/446100647209742336))<br>
<br>
Hey - I wrote you something for lazy friday afternoon reading. http://t.co/FUdgZPA7N9<br>
cool, I&apos;ll give it a read when I find some time. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/447107375002955776))<br>
thanks for putting a lot of effort into the article. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/447454133771976705))<br>
My primary critique is the fixation on mathematical balance, at the expense of anything else, including the very soul of a game. This is a dangerous and common mistake that often sacrifices a game&apos;s flavor to balance a spreadsheet. Our primary concern is long queue times. We should strive to solve the problem &amp; preserve what makes WoW unique and special. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/447455553065738240))<br>
I am not suggesting that you try not to fix it, but rather that by choosing factions, you implicitly accept some imbalance.<br>
Absolutely. It is a tradeoff every game has to make and there is a wide spectrum of implementations as a result. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/447472369326505984))<br>
Compare Call of Duty (which values short queues and visible balancing) to Titanfall (which wants more narrative in MP) (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/447472681202360320))<br>

Classes<br>
quick question, do best players often play at a level above or below the &quot;cap&quot; you designed them with? meaning that does players often find better rotations than the optimal rotation you had in mind when designing?<br>
Not often, but it has happened occasionally. Scorchweaving, Masterfrost, and Festerblight are the 3 cases I can think of...-- (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445683002220085249))<br>
Why did you accept DW masterfrost but kill scorchweav? Curious re thought process. B/c 2H frost exists as altern?<br>
2H Frost existing as an alternate helps. As does it being a complication to the rotation, rather than trivializer. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445699593032851456))<br>
<br>
You (Bliz) think changing the game keeps it &quot;fresh&quot;. Players outside the elite find it tiresome.<br>
Change just for the sake of change is a mistake and a trap. We only act if confident we&apos;re making a real improvement. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/447398566865420288))<br>
<br>
Professions<br>
Why is there a system for Mining/Herbalism/Blacksmithing to fast-level in MoP but not the other professions?<br>
It was something we started small with, to try out. We&apos;re considering doing more of that in the future. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447490225724334082))<br>
<br>
Pets and Pet Battles<br>
Pet cap staying at 25 for new expansion? would love to have Epic quality pets!<br>
Cap staying at L25, didn&apos;t want you to have to level all of your old pets, lots of new pets to level and new trainer challenges (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/447129788625321985))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
Any updates for Toybox regarding items with charges and pure fun trinkets?<br>
Investigating how we can split these up so that the fun effect is in your toybox, may not be possible for everything. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/446808282758250498))<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor Flying<br>
Sounds like developers already made up their minds not alowing flying the entire wod expansion.<br>
If that were the case, we&apos;d say so. Our plan is no Draenor flying in 6.0 and player feedback is important to us. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/446688276825784320))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Are you happy with how Mists of Pandaria panned out?<br>
Overall, yes, especially from a raiding POV. There are of course regrets and lessons learned, though. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/446871083367411712))<br>
Within your realm of responsibility, what do you regard as your biggest success in Mists of Pandaria?<br>
Flexible raiding. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/447398971900563456))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
You seem like the nerdiest Blizzard employee. Either you or Kosak, I cant decide. Hes a lore nerd and you&apos;re a numbers nerd.<br>
There are some REALLY nerdy people at Blizzard. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445444567630757888))<br>
(Which is awesome, BTW. We love to geek out about all manner of nerdy topics.) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445444743057530880))<br>
