Cataclysm is still in early beta but a lot of interface changes are already implemented in the game. This post is the first of a 3-part preview of the interface changes in Cataclysm, today I will just stick to the general interface. <br>
<br>
Spellbook<br>
The Spellbook has been fully revamped, it looks nicer and has a couple of extra features.<br>
Professions now have their own tab.<br>
All spells and their training level are now displayed in the book. <br>
Spells that you can train immediately are now highlighted.<br>
<br>

<br>
Trainers<br>
Class and Profession trainers have a new interface, I&apos;m not really sure it&apos;s more useful than the old one but it&apos;s nicer.<br>
<br>

Blue posts<br>
Next wave of Beta invitations<br>
We hope to distribute additional invites to the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm beta sometime this week, possibly as soon as late Tuesday or Wednesday. This is only an estimate, though, so the schedule may change and, as a result, invites could be distributed earlier or later than anticipated. Either way, we&apos;ll work to keep you as updated as possible. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968569181/when-is-next-beta-wave-comming/))<br>
<br>
World changes in Cataclysm - &quot;Old&quot; zones lost forever<br>
If there&apos;s one lesson I&apos;ve been struggling with a lot recently, it&apos;s that rejecting the nature of change can be damaging. Granted, the trials to which I&apos;m referring aren&apos;t related to video games, though they still apply universally. Sure, places will change, new questlines will replace many old ones, and Azeroth will never look quite the same again. There are, however, new places of beauty, new adventures to be had, and new struggles to overcome in the wake of change. A brand new player joining us in Cataclysm won&apos;t know quite what it was like to level prior to Deathwing&apos;s return, but they&apos;ll get to experience all of the new wonders of the world, not to mention a design that&apos;s become more definitive and polished over the years.<br>
<br>
[...] Trust me, I understand the sentiment. We have no current plans though for preserving elsewhere the areas being changed. The story is evolving. To complement this, so is Azeroth as we know it. For current players, there will still be a good sense of familiarity in so many places within the old world.

<br>
Classes<br>
Block Chance<br>
Your block chance won&apos;t be 5%. That&apos;s too low. It will probably be something like 30%, but we haven&apos;t figured out yet where to provide that 30%. It is likely to be a warrior / paladin only thing or even a Prot / Prot passive. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399820149/protection-warrior/))<br>
<br>
Max out the Mastery Bonus<br>
Furthermore, there should be no way to max out mastery. It&apos;s only just possible to max out things like crit and haste today because of A) overly generous talents, and B) ratings that were never designed for current item levels. We&apos;ve already built the theoretical Deathwing gear, so we can make sure the numbers are more appropriate. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399820149/protection-warrior/))<br>
<br>
Hybrid/Multi-Tree Specs<br>
Whenever a popular hybrid spec comes up, it&apos;s usually because of some sneaky build that is broken for PvP by snaking down to pick up key talents in two trees. It&apos;s not because the player really wants to play as say two specs -- they are just cherry picking the talents. Since those builds almost always feel broken (as in breaking the rules) we don&apos;t want to design around them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969019580/question-clarification-on-new-31-talents/))<br>
<br>
Abilities in new Talent Trees<br>
They aren&apos;t all abilities. Most of the trees have say 4 or so active abilities in addition to the one at level 10. This is pretty consistent with live (an 11, 21, 31, 41 and 51 &quot;clicky&quot; ability).<br>
<br>
The first couple of tiers have mostly simple talents. This is because you just don&apos;t have a lot of abilities at level 10, rotations are simple, stuff tends to die fast, and we don&apos;t want to overwhelm new players (including experienced players trying a new class). We also have to provide a lot of sub-spec potential in these trees.<br>
<br>
Beyond that, things start to get more interesting and you see the talents that do procs or mechanic changes. There are more 1 point talents now, typically those that give raid buffs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969019580/question-clarification-on-new-31-talents/))<br>
<br>
GCD Locked<br>
We consider being GCD locked a bad thing. It doesn&apos;t give you any room in your rotation to say click a potion or respond to a proc or do something out of the ordinary. It leads to tunnel vision. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626351370/my-cataclysm-protection-warrior-wishlist/))<br>

Regrowth<br>
We want Regrowth to feel like the flash heal. It will need to change a little to fit in that model (more up front and less hot perhaps) but it doesn&apos;t also need to feel exactly like Flash Heal to do the job. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969519290/a-question-about-regrowth/))<br>

Holy Paladins in Cataclysm<br>
Holy paladins are changing in Cataclysm probably more than you realize. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968748033/changes-in-cata-and-tank-damage-for-pally/))<br>

Mortal Strike as Fury/Protection<br>
Correct. It is impossible for Fury or Protection to ever have Mortal Strike. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969019580/question-clarification-on-new-31-talents/))<br>
<br>
Dual-Wield<br>
Only Fury warriors will dual-wield in Cataclysm. The Arms tree is completely built around using a two-handed weapon and the Prot tree is completely built around using a shield. There is no reason to dual-wield in those trees. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399740676/please-streamline-the-warrior-trees/))<br>
<br>
Critical Block<br>
We haven&apos;t done much with Critical Block as mastery yet because the level cap on the beta is so low and raid content isn&apos;t available to publicly test yet. As we get closer we&apos;ll put some better numbers on it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626351370/my-cataclysm-protection-warrior-wishlist/))<br>
