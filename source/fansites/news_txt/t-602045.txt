European servers down
A few european servers are down, Blizzard is aware of the problem and working on it.
We’re currently experiencing connection issues with the below realms, and are investigating this with our partners. There’s no ETA at this time. We apologise for the inconvenience and will get back to you with an update as soon as possible.

Affected realms: Aerie Peak, Boulderfist, Eonar, Frostmane, Grim Batol, Jaedenar, Kazzak, Kilrogg, Outland, Ravenholdt, Stonemaul, Tarren Mill, Vek'nilash, Wildhammer

Our technical team is working diligently to resolve this matter, and we hope to have these realms accessible again as soon as possible.

South Park : Make Love, Not Warcraft
The South Park WoW episode: "Make Love, Not Warcraft" won a Creative Arts Emmy Award for "Outstanding Animated Program for Programming Less Than One Hour" and I will use this as an excuse to post something else that I forgot to report last week.

If you didn't see the episode, you can now buy the South Park: The Complete Tenth Season http://shop.comedycentral.com/South-Park--The-Complete-Tenth-Season--3-Discs--Front-Page_stcVVproductId19108230VVcatId424910VVviewprod.htm in Comedy Central online shop, but also, if you use the "WARCRAFT" code you will get a 15% discount and free shipping. Bad news is, it won't work outside of the US as far as I know.
