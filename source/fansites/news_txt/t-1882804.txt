Linkin Park LIVE at BlizzCon 2015!
Whether you’re geeking out on the show floor at BlizzCon or tuning in from home, this is a performance you won’t want to miss: Linkin Park is closing out BlizzCon 2015!


  

The Grammy Award–winning rock band—and the biggest band on Facebook, with 63 million fans and counting—will be taking the stage the evening of Saturday, November 7, to provide an epic send-off for everyone at this year’s convention. Even if you didn’t score tickets to the show, Blizzard gamers and Linkin Park fans around the world can still get a front-row seat from home with the BlizzCon Virtual Ticket 

BlizzCon is the biggest Blizzard party of the year, packed with in-depth developer panels, intense eSports tournaments, the legendary Friday night contests—this year hosted by Wil Wheaton—and what’s sure to be an epic finale from Linkin Park. The Virtual Ticket lets you watch it all online, live and in high definition. Order a Virtual Ticket and you’ll also receive a treasure trove of in-game goodies  for World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, Diablo III, Hearthstone, and Heroes of the Storm.
