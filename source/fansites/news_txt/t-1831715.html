<br>
Patch 6.2 Hotfixes - August 3<br>
Garrisons<br>
Naval Missions<br>
<br>
An Expert Captain threat can now be fully countered by 2 Pandaren Crews or 2 assist ship equipment (Ammo Reserves, Automated Sky Scanner, Extra Quarters, Noisemaker Mines, and Sonic Amplification Field).<br>
<br>
<br>
Quests<br>
Legendary Ring Quest Line<br>
<br>
[Hotfix in testing] Master vs. Commander: Fixed an issue that could cause legendary naval missions needed to obtain a Draenic Sea Chart to not show up correctly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Raids and Dungeons<br>
Hellfire Citadel<br>
General<br>
<br>
Corrected an issue where bonus roll loot tables for Tyrant Velhari and Fel Lord Zakuun&apos;s got swapped on Raid Finder difficulty.<br>
<br>
Kilrogg Deadeye<br>
<br>
Health of adds for the encounter have been reduced by roughly 20% for raid groups with 10 players on Normal and Heroic difficulty. This should help with the difficulty experienced by smaller raid groups losing their DPS when sending players down into the death phase. The health of adds scales back up and should be remain roughly unchanged from before as raid group size increases.<br>
<br>
Gorefiend<br>
<br>
Players who die to Digest or from fatal damage while in the stomach phase in the Gorefiend encounter should now be able to be resurrected once their bodies are teleported back outside.<br>
<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Ashran<br>
<br>
Fixed an issue that could incorrectly cause player pet health to increase while in the center lane in Ashran.<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Reduced the chance to obtain bonus Felblight (http://www.wowdb.com/items/127759-felblight).<br>

Character / Items<br>
is there any plan to fix player inventory? Bank &amp; VS = full. Can&apos;t quest anymore cause no where to put rewards.It&apos;s game breaking<br>
Parden my ignorance, but what all are you keeping? I usually do a purge once per expac of old stuff. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/625221479249018880))<br>
10 years of tier sets &amp; holiday rewards pvp gear. X mog weapons. Why would I purge stuff Ive invested countless hours acquiring?<br>
Sounds like a lot of wearable items! Hopefully we can address this soon. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/625243418583695360))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
<br>
Riot wouldn&apos;t exist if it wasn&apos;t for Blizzard. The only reason is a game is because of Warcraft III customs.<br>
True story. And the War3 editor was based on the Starcraft editor. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/619658521223626752))<br>
