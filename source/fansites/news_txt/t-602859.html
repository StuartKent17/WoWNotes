Rejoice, you&apos;ll finally be able to change this &quot;Leghollass&quot;, but it will cost you 10$. This feature is being tested on a few servers, see the post for a complete list.<br>
We&#x2019;re happy to announce that through the wonders of modern gnomish engineering, you are now able to change your characters&#x2019; names. Finally, you can turn the moniker that seemed like a good idea at the time into something more befitting your true standing in World of Warcraft.<br>
<br>
Visit Account Management to begin the paid character-name-change process. The fee is $10 per name change. As with our recent addition of voice chat to the game, this feature is being rolled out across all realms in several phases. The first-phase realms are listed in this forum post. Enjoy this new feature and the subsequent effect that your bold new name will have on friends and foes alike.<br>

Paladins<br>
The season 3 retribution set has been changed. We&apos;re removing the Armor Penetration and Spell Damage that was being added to season 3, and moving those stat points into Strength. Those changes should be visible in an upcoming PTR build. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366733197&amp;postId=25734107361&amp;sid=1#439))<br>

World Environment<br>
Areas can now be flagged as Contested instead of whole zones, for example the area around Zul&apos;aman will be flagged, and maybe the one around Scarlet Monastery too (This change will affect both PvE and PvP realms). Everything will be made to make sure it doesn&apos;t impact low level quests nearby.
