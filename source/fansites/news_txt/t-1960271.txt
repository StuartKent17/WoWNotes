Restoration Druid Feedback -- Build 21232 -- 3-Mar
The minor tuning changes last build were intended to move a small amount of healing from Wild Growth to Rejuvenation, and to slightly increase costs overall due to the class's currently high efficiency, especially on a single target the latter part is mostly represented by the Swiftmend change. But, we agree the simultaneous healing and cost increase on Rejuvenation looks like it fights against the mastery. Next build will move Rejuvenation's healing and cost slightly back down. Both changes are quite small, but should be noticeable on a spell as frequently used as Rejuvenation. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Hey! How about some early alpha Holy Paladin numbers? 
Good data/feedback. What % of the LotM damage were you counting as negative healing? Celestalon 
For my stats, 265% SP 450 / 1.3 from stoicism, 1.15 from Knight of the Silver Hand, 1.02 from vers. Is that what you mean?
It sounded like you were counting some of the damage taken against its healing, as if it were negative healing. What % of it? Celestalon 
Not really a percent of the healing, I did 450% * crit * mast * vers - 265%
Right, so if it heals for ~40k, and damages you for 15k, the effective healing is somewhere between 25k and 40k. Celestalon 
Clearly, neither of those extremes is reasonable in practice. Factor in things like Overhealing to help, but still subjective. Celestalon 
Right and in a situation where we know we won't take lots of damage, but a specific target will, LotM is strong.
Aye. At a minimum, any overhealing you'd have received following it is no longer overhealing. Celestalon 
Yep. Being able to play with it in raids and with predictable damage will help to see its potential
Indeed. So which does your data reflect, 25k, 40k, or somewhere in the middle? Celestalon 
Both HPM and HPCT are based on the 25k. I usually try do any outside tuning based on logs, which I don't really have yet.
OK, so that data is worst case, got it. Thanks. Celestalon 

Achievements
How about as a reward with Crazy Cat Lady title, you can have more than 3 of the various cat pets?
at some point, we're saving you from yourself Muffinus 

PvP
Any chance on removing the premade tab for Ashran? Looking at both horde/alliance - it's filled with tons of premade groups. Sad 
They'd just go to Custom if we removed it. holinka 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Is that a problem of LFR or of the player base not improving?
It was LFR IMO. Since the group had no owner, nobody had perspective or authority to call for a different strat or call the raid. OccupyGStreet 
why be in there then? The point of raids is to work together & defeat the biggest of the bads not everyone do their own thing
There isn't a ton of motivation to work with a group of strangers when the game can just find you another group trivially. OccupyGStreet 
I also want to reiterate that I am taking blame here, not distributing it. OccupyGStreet 


Computers - Setup of the Month
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices  are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. New GPUs may be coming towards the middle of this year

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 6700K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions!
