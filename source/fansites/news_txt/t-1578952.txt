FEEDBACK: Highmaul - Walled City LFR
This first wing of LFR Highmaul is open for the weekend! 
We've opened the first wing of Highmaul Raid Finder Kargath, Butcher, and Brackenspore for the weekend. It's quite likely that these encounters are overtuned for the intended audience, but we'll be watching closely to make the required tweaks to get the experience to where it needs to be. In general, Raid Finder should be no more challenging than it was in Mists, so please tailor your feedback regarding tuning accordingly.

Warlords Currency Changes
Honor and Conquest definitely are not going away, just to clarify a misconception - you'll still be earning those currencies through PvP and using them to buy your PvP gear.

What will be going away is Justice and Valor. Over time, they've moved away from their original purpose, and given how widely available they'd become awarded from quests, scenarios, dungeons, raids, etc., we'd rather return to the original universal currency: gold. The final values aren't hooked up yet, but the old Valor rewards for completing your daily random dungeon or an LFR wing will be replaced with a hefty sum of gold, which should make something like the gold turn-in for a bonus roll seem far more attainable even for players who currently don't have much gold.

That said, the feedback/suggestion of allowing repeat turn-ins definitely has merit, and it's something we'll discuss and consider. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Importance of Garrisons
Do you think Blizzard is putting too much emphasis on garrisons? Feels like they're heavily tied in with leveling and overall game play to the point you simple cant not do them. I feel Blizzard would do so much better just focusing on epic raids and heaps of dungeons, that's our bread and butter. Trying to reinvent the wheel every expansion will always bring about hits and misses.
We're putting together at long last more information on the Garrisons that will hopefully assuage a lot of concerns people have and share more about the gameplay that goes with it. It will take us a little longer to put that information together for you all, but I think it will shed some light on the depth of Garrisons while also making it clear how much or how little you can interact with them based on what you want from it. They definitely have something to offer pretty much everyone save the rare person.

We'll do our best to try to address as many concerns and questions as people have in those blogs and in the forums here as we go along.

Finally! It has been nearly three months since part one of the supposed four-part water cooler on Garrisons. I figured it was because they've gone through heavy iteration.
It's a great addition to the game and yes, it's gone through a lot of iteration for the better that we hope everyone will be able to enjoy. We just didn't want to put out blogs that weren't as accurate as possible since it is such a big addition. We wanted to do it some justice and the developers too when we presented it.

Read Hellscream, the prelude to Warlords of Draenor
"We will never be slaves! But we will be conquerorsâ€¦"

The pit lord Mannoroth is dead.

Gul'dan and his followers are in chains.

In one night, Grommash Hellscream exposed and thwarted the forces that meant to subjugate the orcs. In one night, Hellscream proved himself a worthy warchief to the Iron Horde and set his people on a violent collision course with another world in another time.

But this was not meant to be. Who warned Hellscream of Gul'dan's treachery? Who convinced him that Azeroth was a foe worth defeating at all costs?

Before Gul'dan's dramatic fall, two strangers arrived on Draenor: Garrosh Hellscream, the deposed warchief of the Horde on Azeroth, and Kairozdormu, a bronze dragon whose motivations were clouded in mystery. The newest World of Warcraft short story, "Hellscream,"  reveals how their actions on Draenor have placed all living beings on Azeroth in mortal peril. Read the short story here, and then delve deeper into the events surrounding the Iron Horde invasion in our lore archives:


War Crimes  - In this novel by Christie Golden, Garrosh Hellscream is put on trial for his crimes during the events of Mists of Pandaria.
Gul'dan and the Stranger  - Gul'dan and Garrosh Hellscream meet face to face for the first time in this free comic written by Micky Neilson, featuring art by Alex Horley.
World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor cinematic  - At a pivotal moment in Draenor's history, Warsong chieftain Grommash Hellscream challenges destiny and reforges the fate of his people.

Classes
Hopefully this question makes sense: Does Haste affect the resource regeneration of multiple classes in some uniform fashion?
Yes. It's completely uniform. 1% is 1%. Celestalon 
Being able to adjust that number might very well solve many problems. I see no downside here. Am I missing something?
The "rate haste affects resource gen" isn't an arbitrary thing. 1% is 1%. That's what haste is. It'd be bizarre otherwise. Celestalon 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
so why do mages with timewarp get a healing cd as well. Rough call there, sorry.
Time Warp is a raid buff, not stackable raid utility. Same as Crit buff or Mastery buff, etc. Celestalon 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Prior to healing tuning, can we get confirmation on Chi Explosion and Breath of the Serpent splitting?
Both are currently intended to split, yes. Celestalon 

PvE
I'm sure everyone knows how ANNOYING it is to try and get raids together during the holidays.
Yes, we do. WatcherDev 

I cant imagine rushing through #Warlords to do molten core at 100.
.Anniversary content will be open for a while, don't rush through Warlords! Lots to see! Muffinus 

Sorry if I missed it but will level 90 UBRS be tuned for fresh 90s or will it be tuned for players who have a decent item level?
For existing 90s who've done at least some Timeless Isle, Siege LFR, etc. New 90s will find rewarding content in Blasted Lands. WatcherDev 

Grom is the final boss of WoD? Please don't let this be true. SOO 2.0 
There's a lot of ground and a lot of story to cover before the book closes on Warlords. Trust me, it won't feel like SoO 2.0. WatcherDev 

PvP
Skirmishes might be better if they'd take player skill into account like an MMR?, or you feel randomness is part of the flavour?
You have a skirmish MMR, its just hidden. holinka 

So, will the TM vs SS be level 100 or level 90? The release date being so close to the anniversary makes it confusing.
We'll have a bunch of different brackets for the anniversary battleground holinka 

World
I'll say it. I'm sick of Orcs.
That's feedback that we are very conscious of, and are taking big steps to make sure it doesn't end up being the case. Celestalon 
There are a ton of different races and creatures in Draenor. Lots to fight besides Orcs. Celestalon 

Misc
Are the dates for the 10th Anniversary on the in-game calendar correct? 4 days to level to 100 to get into the LFR?
The dates are not correct. That is a recurring calendar event that was set up a while back. This year's will be different. WatcherDev 

Good to hear. Release date on a Thursday seems unusual though, lockout-reset day changing to Thursday or just a one time thing?
Expansion releases haven't always been Tues - no general change to lockout timing WatcherDev 
does this give you the ability to patch on Tues/Wed, and unlock midnight Thursday without a patch on release date?
we generally do not patch at all during the week of an expansion release - you'll have all the data needed in 6.0 WatcherDev
