As heal I hate this "nonstop AOE heal spam" playstyle for example.
We do think AE heal spam has gotten out of control again. The healer tookit lacks depth when single target heals are ignored. Source 
It's challenging because every time we nerf AEs, rather than going to single-target heals, healers just feel too weak to heal. Source 

Stop giving abilities 2charges, it's a dumb system..
Why do you think so? We like the system since it lets you hold a CD rather than using it ASAP. Source 

New minor glyphs are nice. ... But some classes ALREADY have too many mandatory minor glyphs, and no room for cosmetic ones
What is a mandatory minor glyph? Source 

are you concerned people are playing specs that sim the highest spa and not the specs they enjoy the most?
Yes. I don't think it's healthy for the game but it's a hard mentality to fight. Source 
For almost all of us, 1% more DPS is not the difference between success or failure. Playing well is. Source 
For almost all of us, the top 100 on Raidbots is not a reflection of what we can do on an encounter. Even more so for sims. Source 

in the world of bring the player not the class shouldn't  be equivalent to lust and not weaker?
If the goal was that you had all buffs regardless of comp then we'd just give them all passively. Source 
Isn't this raid buff thing mostly there to shit on 10m raids? 25s get them all by accident.
Buffs are there to make you feel stronger in a group and to encourage some level of raid diversity. Source 
I just don't see why mark fort and now hero, which we have like 3 copies of each, are handed out, but we gotta struggle.
The original idea with Mark and Fort was that tank survivability is balanced around having those. Source 
It's harder to tell a tank to survive better the way you can usually coax a little more from DPS. Source 
But in MoP I'm not sure the distinction is that relevant anymore. Source 

Don't you think that cooldowns/trinkets are too high? a 250k Chaos Bolt normal going to 900k with procs, isn't that too much?
We do worry that the synergistic effects of lining up CDs with trinkets has grown too large. Lining up shouldn't trump everything. Source 
Personally I think there are just too many cooldowns+trinkets. I'd rather have one big cooldown I use than 4 I have to line up
Yeah, it's a cause of button bloat for sure. Does Ret need AW and GoAK? Does Fury need Skull Banner and Recklessness? Source 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Does the solo Sha kill still not prove how broken blood is? It's still current content and this has been every xpac.
Lei Shen is current content. Sha is many ilevels ago. What is the specific issue that offends you here? How does it hurt you? Source 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Will we ever be able to have hybrid talents trees like we did long ago? I.e. Some spec skills from resto on moonkin = Restokin
With the druid talents in particular we tried to offer healing options to Balance and so on. Source 

When will Resto Druid Glyph of Efflorescence be on PTR? Is this glyph being rethought?
Our concern is that Swiftmend went from being a great ST heal to part of the AE healing kit. Maybe that wasn't the right call. Source 
What exactly does that mean? That doesn't really answer the question...
The answer is yes it is being rethought because we're debating the old vs new role for Swiftmend. No decisions yet. Source 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Removing SS as a talent will cripple BM and SV in PvP, forcing hunters into MM if they want to be able to compete in PvP
So BM for example can have a trinket or a silence. Seems fair. You really need both? When does anyone get a chance to counter? Source 
you do realize that you gave hunter trinket and silence in the first place right? youre arguing with yourself now
Right. That's why we made the change. The original 5.0 talent design was crazy generous to BM PvP. Source 
will we have some dmg buff on kill command in 5.4 ? and you guys think of baking widow venom in serpent sting ?
Long term, we agree Widow Venom needs some work. Short term not thrilled with the idea of e.g. Serpent Spread + Widow Venom. Source 

Why is Snake Trap still in the game? It does like 300 dps on level 90. It's completely useless.
We agree it needs a better niche. Reluctant to yank it since it has a unique kit vs. the 200 spells in the game named Frost X. Source 

The tooltip says "preventing any spell in that school from being cast for 3 sec" so yes.
You can also use Silencing Shot preemptively to stop the cast, while Counter Shot has to land during the cast. Source 

Talking with several hunters, agreement that Readiness going away is fine if other spells are adjusted as well.
We're thinking 2 charges on Deterrence and Disengage, then other buffs to things like Kill Command. Source 
Wouldn't that be a big buff with the talented 1min Deter? 1min and 5min Deter vs both are up in 2mins?
Charges just gives them what they have today with Readiness, though IIRC the base CDS are longer. Source 
This is an example where I am expressing design intent no Readiness and not tuning... yet. Source 

what's the real difference between counter shot and silencing shot?
The silence...? Source 

Have you seen this post detailing some concerns about hunters?  has some nice points.
We are pretty happy with raid utility for all specs. Every class asks for more to guarantee a raid spot. Source 
What utility do hunters offer in 25m or even well organized 10m that another class or two don't already bring?
That is true of everyone but warlocks, who probably bring too much. Source 

Stampede was never intended to provide utility. It's a DPS cooldown. Source 
It's now a 20 second DOT on a 5 minute CD that is worth 1% of our total damage. Least compelling CD in the game?
Do keep in mind that total damage and damage per second both have different benefits. Source 
Do keep in mind that it is our 87 ability, and it is exactly like Dire Beast. "Insulting" is the word.
So how much damage do you think Stampede needs to do to be fair? Source 

Will you EVER get rid of arcane shot for spec unique dumps? It's a remnant from days of Hunter mana; Please remove
Having different focus dumps would help with spec distinction. Source 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
They think Frost PvP is "balanced" as is on PTR and that people enjoy the RNG of Fire and the poor scaling of Frost.
We try not to tell you what you enjoy. We design specs and encourage you to play the specs that appeal to you the most. Source 
When players try to redesign specs too much we worry they're just looking for something different than we're offering. Source 

Excuse Masta, he's a bit pissed as I am, though to be fair. If you can overhaul warlock talents, why not Mage???
It's just a matter of degree. KJC and AV risked breaking all of our encounters. Source 

54% crit as fire with CM, zero heroic gear, hit/haste staff. ilvl528. 5.4 scaling problems? Same old CM nerf inc or plans?
Don't know yet. It's cool to have crit -> something cool happens, but we're souring on the whole weak until X%, then OP design. Source 
We had the same problem with warriors previously. Just feels like crit has to be between say 30 and 70% for the design to work. Source 
WoW's problem has become that for y=mx+c 'm' is too large and 'c' is too small. MoP T16 has 3x stats of H 5m
Are you saying that about Fire or as some kind of generic problem? Source 
Because we like huge gear jumps between tiers. Allows us to challenge the best guilds and those that come later with more gear. Source 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
WW needs something besides dps to offer. Every other melee has a raid cooldown, major raid healing or both. WW has neither.
The utility arms race won't end well. Someone will always have the best and others will still want more to compete. Source 

And if you haven't already a good thread  regarding concerns and discussion on the changes as well
The intent isn't to nerf WW overall -- we're not finished yet. It will end up with Rune just being good instead of crazy OP. Source 
On the flip side, you won't be so dependent on Rune or any specific trinket. Source 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
You need to understand LoD is too weak and you tuned SoO encounters to favor hotsEF. On no boss so far would LoD outdo EF.
Paladins survived for years without hots. We don't buy that they are utterly dependent on a talent that is like a year old. Source 

continued we do it because the alternative doesn't exist. When u floored Holy Radiance u made the 3hp finisher too important
If the finishers aren't good, we find paladins just spam the builders and ignore the finishers, which feels bad too. Source 

To continue, we don't want every paladin playing like a Resto druid, and honestly neither should you paladins. EF shouldn't be mandatory. Source 
Agree100%. I am growing to hate having to take EF. Every fight my top heal is an absorb. Should just play my Disc priest.
Exactly. We don't argue it's effective. But we question whether it's really fun or fits the paladin kit. Source 
If you recall, EF was limit one until very late in MoP beta. It's an example of a change we should not have made so late. Source 
Obviously had big consequences. Source 

you fked up prots in PvP because of all qq from none tank players.. you need to be fired
Do you realize you won't have any opponents in PvP for long if you're having tons of fun and they aren't? Source 
Tanks in PvP are "you can't kill me" which is super frustrating for everyone else. If there's another design we're open to it. Source 

+10% on LoD won't help much, increase the amount of targets hit and increase holy radiance's 6 target cap in 25man.
We don't like non-CD AE heals with huge target caps. Trying it with HR only because we want Resto to be awesome when clumped. Source 

Then give us something to use as an alternative, the other two talents in that tier are a joke, at best.
We buffed SH a lot for Holy. Looking at what we can do to SS for them. Source 

Don't want to play like a druid, either. Concerned about number balance since EF hot/shield accounts for so much on live
Yes. Our strategy is to try to buff LoD w/out killing WoG or EF. Source 

i still dont understand why paladins are getting a fear when we have repentance, unless its instant n1 will go for it
PvP balance has a great deal to do with team synergy, not the tools of the individual. Fears are a valuable and hard to get DR. Source 

Healer balance is looking good! Feels like Shaman, Druids, Monks, and Priests are going into 5.4 feeling good. Pallies need <3
Going to try DP scaling with Spirit. GoAK with AE heals. Maybe buff to WoG, EF, LoD. Source 
Clarifications from Lore seems great. I hope the change to GoAK will be an overall buff. Also 40y on LoD would be nice.
The intent is that GoAK is a buff. We agree that it's a lot of single-target overhealing in today's environment. Source 
Considered lowering the CD, but we'd have to nerf the HPS and it would also get macro'd with Divine Favor a lot. Source 
What HPS? Paladin HPS is bad on the PTR.The updated GoAk on a 5min cd is hardly going to be enough to push that up.
Do you have any logs or other data to support that? It's unfortunately too easy just to tweet for buffs with no support. Source 

Not nearly enough to compensate for SoI sadly.
We didn't balance Holy around 100% SoI usage because we knew that was unrealistic. We balanced them around DP. Source 
For Prot, we buffed Guarded by the Light to 15% mana return to compensate for SoI. Source 
Guys are making of mess of the last patch. Should of done this retooling with an expansion.
It's often a tough balance. Many players want their issues fixed NOW and don't want to wait an indeterminate time in the future. Source 

These are reassuring words. Any chance that for Holy SoI/BattleHealer and Judgment could scale for SelflH use?
Might try Selfless Healer gives Judgment Holy Power for Holy, but nervous about that one. Source 

Divine Plea no longer reduces healing in 5.4. Truth/datamine? What about Glyph of Divine Plea--changing?
Truth at least for the moment - anything could change. Not sure of glyph future yet. Source 

Holy Paladins are lacking in the PTR 5.4 at the moment. Any hope for compensation considering the Eternal Flame nerfs we got ?
EF, like GoSac and KJC are intended as rule-breaking talents. We want to see some players use them but not all. Source 
It's funny, the talents that the warlock community, on average, liked the most, y'all hate and decided to destroy
I feel like they liked them because they made the class easy to play without a corresponding DPS loss. Source 

t16 4pc for ret is really boring gameplay. Button lights up = press it when a free gcd = not fun.
Did you find your t15 TVs hitting harder to be more engaging? Seems even easier to ignore. Source 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Holy word:Sanctuary performs awful, increasing the reduced amount and radius insteadof reduce the mana cost is better. 
Sanc isn't intended to be a go to AE spell. It is intended to be layered with other spells to be ticking while they do. Source 
Too much buffing and it becomes like Healing Rain, a big weapon in the Resto toolkit. But that's not what we want for Sanc. Source 

speaking of healing is holy priest ever going to be as good as disc again?
You have to define good. Holy is a great healer and better than Disc in some fights. Atonement makes Disc very popular in 10s. Source 
And Atonement itself isn't OP, but the ease with which Disc can swap from DPS healing to shielding is quite useful esp in 10s. Source 

Dear crabby, is there any news regarding Divine Hymn becoming baseline again for all priest specs?
We don't really think Disc or Shadow need more CDs or utility, respectively. Source 

with the recent changes to apparitions on the ptr, is there also a movement speed increase to them? Or would it not be needed?
We don't want them to move super fast or they become just another missile. Shouldn't have big pathing problems anymore though. Source 
whats wrong with JUST ANOTHER missile? its gona be the only missile shadowpriest has. STOP discriminating ffs
Resistance to making everything the same is not the same as discrimination. We don't want SA to be Shadow Bolt. Source 

Limited, too. 30 sec Chakra CD makes it tough to be flexible.
We could consider lowering CD, but we don't want "Chakra twisting" every time you want to cast e.g. CoH. Source 

Any plans on giving disc divine hymh back? maybe make it share a cooldown with PW:B?
Feel like Disc needs more limitations, not more tools. Source 

Is Holy Priests' HW: Sanc ever going to be looked at number wise? It's pretty terrible and even with new 4set won't be used.
It is meant to be layered along with PoH etc. so both are happening at once. It isn't intended as a high priority AE heal. Source 

Holy regen is too low. Disc mp5 is very comfortable indeed, but nerfing it wouldn't solve the low holy regen.
We are worried that Holy regen is where the other healers are but that Disc can largely ignore mana. Source 

clarify how you think holy competes w disc?Don't have utility or damage disc has chakra limits st/aoe heals gap esp > in 10's
Holy heals fine. I think the desirability of Disc in 10s is purely Atonement. Source 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Fierydemise has some raw sim date for your proposed combat changes  Combat's going to need more tbh.
Yeah to be fair, we haven't tuned the damage yet. Just focused on pacing. Bandit's Guile may need tweaking too. Source 

it seems for rogues this coming tier combat is looking less desirable than sub in raids. Is this the intent?
Are you basing that on anything other than DPS which isn't tuned for 5.4 yet? Source 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
What use does the Conductivity Change have if you cant have 2 Healing Rains at a time?
It isn't intended to let you splash rains around the entire raid, and technically the spell cannot even work that way. Source 
The idea is you can keep HR going without spending the cast time just by casting other spells. Source 
Why buff HR when we're already good in packed situations? Isn't HTT nerf making us weaker in spread situations? CH still slow
We like that Resto shaman look at the battlefield and not just the target frames. Source 
We'd rather make them stronger while grouped than just like everyone else. Source 
Would you agree Shaman should be superior than every other healer when stacked to justify poor spread healing?
Yes. That is the intent. Just need to rectify that with e.g. SCK. Source 

Resto Shaman are lacking in the PTR 5.4 at the moment. Any hope for compensation considering the poor spread healing we got ?
We understand players will say that's not enough, but we still want shaman to care about grouping and to perform better then. Source 
Make chaining glyph baseline with no CD for resto.
No CD means your rotation would likely turn into CH CH CH CH CH CH. It was that way once.... Source 
Also, if CH is being spam, that implies other abilities aren't good enough and should be buffed so CH doesn't HAVE to be spam
That argues that no spell needs a cooldown, just buffs to other spells. We don't think rotations work that way. Source 
But the thing about grouping is that we are losing even on those fights to ppl who have better spread healing.
Yes. This is what we're trying to fix. Source 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
What's the story behind affliction changes? Just curious, I'm guessing it's because they rely on fillers and not the DoTs?
Wanted to nerf MG a little bit and buff dots since you can't always MG especially in PvP. Still want MG to be good of course. Source 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
GC, i think Revenge needs an increased cleave range. Its a little dumb the ability not hitting secondary targets some times.
Possibly. I can't recall of the top of my head. Is the range 5 or 8? Source 

Can bladestorm be baseline to arms please. It was an iconic arms ability and now we just can't afford to take it in PvP
We'd rather get it to a point where it's competitive in PvP. Baking in talents and adding new ones leads to button bloat. Source 

Actually, changing stances every couple of seconds was exactly what made warrior gameplay so fun and engaging
It was a very common request to remove the old stance restrictions. Lots of "no other class has this liability" etc. Source 

You guys really like Arms rotation? it works but it's... really boring to spam OP. op could be our revenge proc TFB changed?
Wouldn't you run into a lot of MS -> empty GCD? Source 

Any plans on bringing the sunder armor debuff up to date? I dont think anyone has spent the gcds/rage on actual Sunder in mop
Maybe have CS and Devastate apply Sunder and cut the core ability. Source
