As heal I hate this "nonstop AOE heal spam" playstyle for example.
We do think AE heal spam has gotten out of control again. The healer tookit lacks depth when single target heals are ignored. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356130747364544513
It's challenging because every time we nerf AEs, rather than going to single-target heals, healers just feel too weak to heal. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356130907784097792

Stop giving abilities 2charges, it's a dumb system..
Why do you think so? We like the system since it lets you hold a CD rather than using it ASAP. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355448354823618560

New minor glyphs are nice. ... But some classes ALREADY have too many mandatory minor glyphs, and no room for cosmetic ones
What is a mandatory minor glyph? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355423120401764353

are you concerned people are playing specs that sim the highest spa and not the specs they enjoy the most?
Yes. I don't think it's healthy for the game but it's a hard mentality to fight. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352095864732397570
For almost all of us, 1% more DPS is not the difference between success or failure. Playing well is. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352096047851511808
For almost all of us, the top 100 on Raidbots is not a reflection of what we can do on an encounter. Even more so for sims. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352096218630979586

in the world of bring the player not the class shouldn't http://t.co/s32qQttF4q be equivalent to lust and not weaker?
If the goal was that you had all buffs regardless of comp then we'd just give them all passively. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350640762343538689
Isn't this raid buff thing mostly there to shit on 10m raids? 25s get them all by accident.
Buffs are there to make you feel stronger in a group and to encourage some level of raid diversity. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350659198029271042
I just don't see why mark fort and now hero, which we have like 3 copies of each, are handed out, but we gotta struggle.
The original idea with Mark and Fort was that tank survivability is balanced around having those. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350821847111184384
It's harder to tell a tank to survive better the way you can usually coax a little more from DPS. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350821999729328128

Don't you think that cooldowns/trinkets are too high? a 250k Chaos Bolt normal going to 900k with procs, isn't that too much?
We do worry that the synergistic effects of lining up CDs with trinkets has grown too large. Lining up shouldn't trump everything. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350707058494021632
Personally I think there are just too many cooldowns+trinkets. I'd rather have one big cooldown I use than 4 I have to line up

Removing SS as a talent will cripple BM and SV in PvP, forcing hunters into MM if they want to be able to compete in PvP

will we have some dmg buff on kill command in 5.4 ? and you guys think of baking widow venom in serpent sting ?
Long term, we agree Widow Venom needs some work. Short term not thrilled with the idea of e.g. Serpent Spread + Widow Venom. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356124251746607104

Why is Snake Trap still in the game? It does like 300 dps on level 90. It's completely useless.

The tooltip says "preventing any spell in that school from being cast for 3 sec" so yes.
You can also use Silencing Shot preemptively to stop the cast, while Counter Shot has to land during the cast. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355775236140056577

Talking with several hunters, agreement that Readiness going away is fine if other spells are adjusted as well.
We're thinking 2 charges on Deterrence and Disengage, then other buffs to things like Kill Command. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355446169616392193
Wouldn't that be a big buff with the talented 1min Deter? 1min and 5min Deter vs both are up in 2mins?
Charges just gives them what they have today with Readiness, though IIRC the base CDS are longer. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355482459929968640
This is an example where I am expressing design intent no Readiness and not tuning... yet. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355482542067036161

what's the real difference between counter shot and silencing shot?
The silence...? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355423642441621504

Have you seen this post detailing some concerns about hunters? http://t.co/NlAMMnOwjPIt has some nice points.
We are pretty happy with raid utility for all specs. Every class asks for more to guarantee a raid spot. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350663595475996674
What utility do hunters offer in 25m or even well organized 10m that another class or two don't already bring?
That is true of everyone but warlocks, who probably bring too much. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352113914055634944

Clarifications from Lore seems great. I hope the change to GoAK will be an overall buff. Also 40y on LoD would be nice.
The intent is that GoAK is a buff. We agree that it's a lot of single-target overhealing in today's environment. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355485294163787778
Considered lowering the CD, but we'd have to nerf the HPS and it would also get macro'd with Divine Favor a lot. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355485383926087681
What HPS? Paladin HPS is bad on the PTR.The updated GoAk on a 5min cd is hardly going to be enough to push that up.
Do you have any logs or other data to support that? It's unfortunately too easy just to tweet for buffs with no support. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355775834843398144

Not nearly enough to compensate for SoI sadly.
We didn't balance Holy around 100% SoI usage because we knew that was unrealistic. We balanced them around DP. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355484508503543809
For Prot, we buffed Guarded by the Light to 15% mana return to compensate for SoI. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355484712644509696
Guys are making of mess of the last patch. Should of done this retooling with an expansion.
It's often a tough balance. Many players want their issues fixed NOW and don't want to wait an indeterminate time in the future. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355775615292542976

These are reassuring words. Any chance that for Holy SoI/BattleHealer and Judgment could scale for SelflH use?
Might try Selfless Healer gives Judgment Holy Power for Holy, but nervous about that one. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355485697664237571

Divine Plea no longer reduces healing in 5.4. Truth/datamine? What about Glyph of Divine Plea--changing?
Truth at least for the moment - anything could change. Not sure of glyph future yet. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355395900425764864

Holy Paladins are lacking in the PTR 5.4 at the moment. Any hope for compensation considering the Eternal Flame nerfs we got ?
EF, like GoSac and KJC are intended as rule-breaking talents. We want to see some players use them but not all. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350645965289553920
It's funny, the talents that the warlock community, on average, liked the most, y'all hate and decided to destroy
I feel like they liked them because they made the class easy to play without a corresponding DPS loss. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352115348348223488

t16 4pc for ret is really boring gameplay. Button lights up = press it when a free gcd = not fun.
Did you find your t15 TVs hitting harder to be more engaging? Seems even easier to ignore. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352111805830660096

Holy word:Sanctuary performs awful, increasing the reduced amount and radius insteadof reduce the mana cost is better. 
Sanc isn't intended to be a go to AE spell. It is intended to be layered with other spells to be ticking while they do. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356125748194586624
Too much buffing and it becomes like Healing Rain, a big weapon in the Resto toolkit. But that's not what we want for Sanc. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356125878645821440

speaking of healing is holy priest ever going to be as good as disc again?
You have to define good. Holy is a great healer and better than Disc in some fights. Atonement makes Disc very popular in 10s. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356121942996160513
And Atonement itself isn't OP, but the ease with which Disc can swap from DPS healing to shielding is quite useful esp in 10s. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356122075397758976

Dear crabby, is there any news regarding Divine Hymn becoming baseline again for all priest specs?
We don't really think Disc or Shadow need more CDs or utility, respectively. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356119796623998977

with the recent changes to apparitions on the ptr, is there also a movement speed increase to them? Or would it not be needed?
We don't want them to move super fast or they become just another missile. Shouldn't have big pathing problems anymore though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355395371582767106
whats wrong with JUST ANOTHER missile? its gona be the only missile shadowpriest has. STOP discriminating ffs
Resistance to making everything the same is not the same as discrimination. We don't want SA to be Shadow Bolt. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355452448724357120

Limited, too. 30 sec Chakra CD makes it tough to be flexible.
We could consider lowering CD, but we don't want "Chakra twisting" every time you want to cast e.g. CoH. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352134037835485184

Any plans on giving disc divine hymh back? maybe make it share a cooldown with PW:B?
Feel like Disc needs more limitations, not more tools. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352098736240988163

Is Holy Priests' HW: Sanc ever going to be looked at number wise? It's pretty terrible and even with new 4set won't be used.
It is meant to be layered along with PoH etc. so both are happening at once. It isn't intended as a high priority AE heal. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352098044088549377

Holy regen is too low. Disc mp5 is very comfortable indeed, but nerfing it wouldn't solve the low holy regen.
We are worried that Holy regen is where the other healers are but that Disc can largely ignore mana. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352096987484667907

clarify how you think holy competes w disc?Don't have utility or damage disc has chakra limits st/aoe heals gap esp > in 10's
Holy heals fine. I think the desirability of Disc in 10s is purely Atonement. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352094069754826753

Fierydemise has some raw sim date for your proposed combat changes http://t.co/b0dyEezlzv. Combat's going to need more tbh.
Yeah to be fair, we haven't tuned the damage yet. Just focused on pacing. Bandit's Guile may need tweaking too. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356131652310806528

it seems for rogues this coming tier combat is looking less desirable than sub in raids. Is this the intent?
Are you basing that on anything other than DPS which isn't tuned for 5.4 yet? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355804551489650690

What use does the Conductivity Change have if you cant have 2 Healing Rains at a time?
It isn't intended to let you splash rains around the entire raid, and technically the spell cannot even work that way. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350717995716325376
The idea is you can keep HR going without spending the cast time just by casting other spells. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350717845648314370
Why buff HR when we're already good in packed situations? Isn't HTT nerf making us weaker in spread situations? CH still slow
We like that Resto shaman look at the battlefield and not just the target frames. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351126053885968386
We'd rather make them stronger while grouped than just like everyone else. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351126146550730752
Would you agree Shaman should be superior than every other healer when stacked to justify poor spread healing?
Yes. That is the intent. Just need to rectify that with e.g. SCK. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351132023567564801

Resto Shaman are lacking in the PTR 5.4 at the moment. Any hope for compensation considering the poor spread healing we got ?
We understand players will say that's not enough, but we still want shaman to care about grouping and to perform better then. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350716375645421568
Make chaining glyph baseline with no CD for resto.
No CD means your rotation would likely turn into CH CH CH CH CH CH. It was that way once.... Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350727214830059520
Also, if CH is being spam, that implies other abilities aren't good enough and should be buffed so CH doesn't HAVE to be spam
That argues that no spell needs a cooldown, just buffs to other spells. We don't think rotations work that way. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350825953942970368
But the thing about grouping is that we are losing even on those fights to ppl who have better spread healing.
Yes. This is what we're trying to fix. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351126385852551168

What's the story behind affliction changes? Just curious, I'm guessing it's because they rely on fillers and not the DoTs?
Wanted to nerf MG a little bit and buff dots since you can't always MG especially in PvP. Still want MG to be good of course. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355447984877604866

GC, i think Revenge needs an increased cleave range. Its a little dumb the ability not hitting secondary targets some times.
Possibly. I can't recall of the top of my head. Is the range 5 or 8? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356123837336780801

Can bladestorm be baseline to arms please. It was an iconic arms ability and now we just can't afford to take it in PvP
We'd rather get it to a point where it's competitive in PvP. Baking in talents and adding new ones leads to button bloat. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351132538724560896

Actually, changing stances every couple of seconds was exactly what made warrior gameplay so fun and engaging
It was a very common request to remove the old stance restrictions. Lots of "no other class has this liability" etc. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351125283094528000

You guys really like Arms rotation? it works but it's... really boring to spam OP. op could be our revenge proc TFB changed?
Wouldn't you run into a lot of MS -> empty GCD? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351121526780727296

Any plans on bringing the sunder armor debuff up to date? I dont think anyone has spent the gcds/rage on actual Sunder in mop
Maybe have CS and Devastate apply Sunder and cut the core ability. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350701923470540800
