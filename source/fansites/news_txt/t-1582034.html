<br>
<br>
Rotation Depth and Talents<br>
We&#x2019;ve changed the combat rotations of each Hunter specialization (primarily through Ability Pruning) with the goal of them being a platform to build upon with talents. To facilitate this, we&#x2019;ve modified several talents to add additional rotational depth. Hunters had many talent options which added abilities to their rotation, but most of them had quite simple usage, with little interaction with your rotation or other abilities. Now, there should be more of a variety; still some simple talents, but also some talents that create a more engaging combat rotation.<br>
<br>
Barrage (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/120360) now has a 20 second cooldown (down from 30 seconds), costs 60 Focus (up from 30 Focus), and its damage has been increased by 100%.<br>

Fervor (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/82726) has been replaced with a new passive ability, Steady Focus (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53224).<br>
<br>
Steady Focus (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53224) increases Focus Regeneration by 50% for 10 seconds after using Cobra Shot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/77767) or Steady Shot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56641) twice in a row, or after using Focusing Shot.<br>
<br>
<br>
Survival Changes<br>
Apart from rotational changes through Ability Pruning, changes for Survival Hunters mostly center on Lock and Load (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56343). We changed how Lock and Load (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56343) is triggered to increase the value of Multistrike, provide gameplay depth and the ability to pool damage more. Also note the new passive ability, Survivalist, which increases multistrike chance by 10%, in order to give Survival Hunters some baseline Multistrike chance.<br>
<br>
(Line moved to Ability Consolidation and Refinement.) Black Arrow (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/3674) now deals 60% more damage, inflicts Shadow damage every 3 seconds (up from every 2 seconds), has a duration of 18 seconds (down from 20 seconds), and triggers Lock and Load (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56343) on Multistrike hits.<br>
(Line moved to Ability Consolidation and Refinement) Lock and Load (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56343) effects have been incorporated into Black Arrow (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/3674) and have been redesigned.<br>
<br>
Lock and Load (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56343) now causes the next Explosive Shot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53301) to not trigger its cooldown, but no longer causes it to be free or reset the ability&apos;s current cooldown. This effect can stack up to 5 times.<br>
<br>
Survivalist is a new passive ability learned by Survival Hunters at level 10.<br>
<br>
Survivalist increases Multistrike damage by 20% the chance to Multistrike by 10%, and causes the Hunter to gain 15% health over 10 seconds after killing a target.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage<br>
Ability Consolidation and Refinement<br>
<br>
Frostbolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/116) can no longer be used to heal the Mage&apos;s Water Elemental.<br>
<br>
<br>
Frost Changes<br>
<br>
The Brain Freeze (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/44549) effect now increases Frostfire Bolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/44614) damage by 25% 15%, and can now stack up to 2 times. It also no longer triggers from the Bomb Talents, and instead has a 10% chance to trigger from Frostbolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/116) casts. Each Multistrike of Frostbolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/116) increases that cast&apos;s chance by an additional 25%. (Total of 60% on double-Multistrikes).<br>

<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin <br>
Ability Consolidation and Refinement<br>
<br>
Selfless Healer (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/85804) no longer causes Bastion of Glory to apply to Flash of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/19750). For Holy Paladins, it now increases the healing of Flash of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/19750) on others by 35% per stack (up from 20%). For Retribution and Protection Paladins, the effect on Flash of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/19750) remains unchanged.<br>
(Moved to Holy Changes) Tower of Radiance (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/85512)&#x2019;s effects have been merged into baseline Beacon of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53652).<br>

<br>
Tower of Radiance (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/85512) now causes Flash of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/19750) and Holy Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/635) on a Beacon of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53652) target to refund 40% of the spell&#x2019;s Mana cost instead of generating 1 Holy Power.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue <br>
Combat Changes<br>
<br>
Revealing Strike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/84617) now grants Sinister Strike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/1752) a 25% chance to generate an extra Combo Point (up from 20%) deals 20% more damage, but no longer advances Bandit&apos;s Guile (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/84654).<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman <br>

<br>

Earth Shock (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8042) will consume any charges beyond 1, dealing their total damage to the enemy target.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Elemental and Enhancement Changes<br>
<br>
Magma Totem (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8190)&#x2019;s damage has been increased by 100%, and now ticks faster with Haste.<br>
Maelstrom Weapon (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/51530)&#x2019;s chance to trigger has been reduced by 20%.<br>

We also tweaked the design of Master Demonologist, in order to solve some edge cases, and simplify and clarify its effects.<br>
<br>
Mastery: Master Demonologist (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/77219) has been slightly changed. It now passively increases all damage by 6% regardless of form. While in Metamorphosis (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/103958), it further increases the damage of Touch of Chaos (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/112089), Chaos Wave, Doom, Immolation Aura, and Soul Fire (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/6353) while by 12%. <br>

<br>
<br>
Enrage and Deep Wounds<br>
With the introduction of one of the level-100 Warrior Talents, which deals Fire damage, We also expanded Enrage (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/13046) to affect all damage, not just Physical damage, and increased its duration slightly so that it can cover burst windows like Colossus Smash (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/86346) adequately. We&apos;re also making a change to the design of Deep Wounds (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115768), to try to limit is effectiveness in PvP, without hurting its effectiveness in PvE. <br>

.Well we all want to hear it. MM thoughts/impressions?<br>
.I was pleasantly surprised, actually. The Bombardment weaving, Thrill of the Hunt, and Kill Shots added more than I expected. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/502618207514284032))<br>
You seem to be the only person positive about MM in WoD. Why can&apos;t I find any positive reviews about MM changes ?<br>
As a player, I had fun, but I&apos;m coming into it from a very different perspective. Both mine and your perspectives... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/502913015679688708))<br>
...are valid and valuable. (Mine=inexperienced playing it, at least recently, and yours=very experienced playing it) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/502913231015272450))<br>
As a *developer* however, those are both perspectives that we need to try to satisfy, and we totally understand... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/502913360778641409))<br>
...your point of view, and are looking at ways to satisfy both, better. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/502913485752135680))<br>
<br>
are you guys gonna do another pass on talents? I think some hunter talents could use some work.<br>
Unlikely at this stage that talents will be redesigned, but they will definitely be tuned. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/502924427172904967))<br>
<br>
How come the extra 5 yards and camo not breaking for 6 sec was scrapped from MM and Surv? I thought those was really cool perks.<br>
Range was replaced with Sniper Training. Camo was too strong/frustrating, so was cut. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/502945226197987329))<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o))<br>
so this supposed healer balance patch ignored MW ENTIRELY. Reason behind ignoring in this round of tuning? MW needs help BAD<br>
False. Enveloping down 30%, Uplift up 30%, ChEx down 10%, ChiBrew down 1 tea, Jab cost up 8%, Emin up 43%, Pool Renews up 15%, (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/502823460087689216))<br>
Wait, Uplift got buffed 30%? Don&apos;t see that reflected in any patch notes or data mining. I see the rest of them.<br>
Well it wouldn&apos;t be in patch notes. Double checked, looks like those two changes are actually in next build, not last. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/502945076394225664))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
hey watcher. You tweeted me months ago about account wide tabards. no updates still?<br>
It&apos;s something that will likely accompany a transmog revamp/UI since it&apos;s a very similar sort of system (cosmetic appearance). (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/502887273361182720))<br>
<br>
I&apos;ll never give up. - This .39% DR and .72% Damage bonus is really terrible as a 4 set...<br>
.The PvP set bonuses with Versatility are completely not tuned. They&apos;ll probably end up in the 10% range. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/502921705249964040))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Will there ever be an implementation of RBGs at BlizzCon? In example, a booth where some of the top RBG teams can Vs. One another?<br>
Not this Blizzcon. Something to think about for the future perhaps. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/502852474555097088))<br>
<br>
Something we&apos;re exploring in an upcoming build: Discipline gets Silence baseline. We expect mixed reactions. Please try it on beta. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/502896996483481600))<br>
Not much help against mele specs, i think baseline fear still in need.<br>
Warriors and Rogues, no. Ret and DK, yes. Monk and Enhance to a small extent. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/502903317006012416))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
how do you feel about ghostcrawlers comment about working on Wow? <br>
Different games have different goals. The best designers align their work with those goals...and Greg is one of the best. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/502646134251462657))<br>
