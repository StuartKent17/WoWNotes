Patch 5.4 Hotfixes - December 2<br>
Creatures<br>
<br>
The Celestials (Chi-Ji, Niuzao, Xuen, and Yu&apos;lon) have their health reduced to 25% of original health. If more than 10 players from the same faction are engaged with the Celestial, their health will scale up. The health increase will cap at 100% of their original health with 40 players.<br>

CC in Warlords of Draenor<br>
We are planning to take a strong look at CC in Warlords with the intent of dialing things back a little. We do think it&apos;s important that players are rewarded for using CC intelligently (by coordinating usage, being mindful of diminishing returns, etc), but we think we can approach things in a way that allows us to tone down CC overall while still providing that gameplay. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/282735-will-warlords-reduce-the-amount-of-cc/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10717442112?page=4#62))<br>

Daze Effect<br>
Oh man! Remember when it was based on Defense so tanks could essentially run anywhere and never get dazed but us cloth wearers would be in dazed-city? Crazy. Although they had to pay more repairs back then too. XD<br>
<br>
Don&apos;t hear too much about it these days though, kind of a fun discussion to have again! In-general the world should be dangerous, and when you can ride through it unaffected, or have guaranteed escapes, it loses some of that danger. It&apos;s a lot of the same reasoning for non-flying in new content. Sure, you can still escape many situations, and there are still some get-out-of-jail-free cards, but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s a good idea to remove all of the situations which cause you to be cautious, plan travel routes, and have to play your character in this Roleplaying Game. We think the daze mechanic still serves its useful purpose.

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/us-en.png Connected Realms Update<br>
As previously announced, we&#x2019;ve been working toward connecting realms to increase the number of players on low-population realms, and since then have completed several connections. <br>
<br>
Future Connections<br>
We do not have a date for the following realm connections, but will update this blog post when we do.<br>
<br>
Next &#x200B;&#x200B;Batch<br>
<br>
Andorhal and Ursin<br>
Crushridge and Anub&apos;arak/Chromaggus/Garithos/Nathrezim/Smolderthorn<br>
Icecrown and Malygos<br>
Quel&apos;dorei and Sen&apos;jin<br>
<br>
<br>
&#x200B;Plans for these connections may change at any time, but we&#x2019;ll provide additional updates on specific dates for future connections here as we can. Please note that as a part of the connection process realm times may change to match each other.<br>

Professions<br>
Also if sockets that uncommon do you have plans to rebalance profession perks or just ignore for another expansion?<br>
I&apos;d like to cut them TBH. Not sure we can pull that off. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405463712347078656))<br>
<br>
I can&apos;t remember...were professions discussed with the instant 90s?<br>
We likely need some solution, but aren&apos;t crazy about just &quot;choose which prof you want at max.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403952590204833792))<br>
<br>
Lore<br>
Why are there no female Warlords of Draenor? You couldn&apos;t have come up with a single one?<br>
Their identities already established in the lore. We could have replaced one, but that might have felt transparent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401046106152251392))<br>
<br>
&quot;Gameplay trumps lore.&quot; &quot;We want to let you play with friends.&quot; So when can my gnome play with my RealID friend&apos;s blood elf?<br>
Having two factions also produces good gameplay. It was a conscious decision not dictated by lore. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401043121384853504))<br>
<br>
so we got suspended from Heroes to Soldiers again. Feels wrong! Do you think about Lore when you make such Decisions?<br>
We are crafting the story so hopefully you feel like heroes. That is why you are asked to return to the dark portal. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402535736651419648))<br>
That is why you command the garrison. If being heroic meant you could not be threatened, the game would be boring. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402535832772280320))<br>
<br>
UI / Addons<br>
This is NOT a full group finder system. These are some moderate updates to the current system that people may find useful.<br>
Takes our crappy old raid browser and enables some cross realm functionality. Still doing a new Group Finder for 6.0. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403632954120736768))<br>
To be fair, it needs to be a LFM and not LFG thus the need for oqueue. Hopefully blizzard realizes this<br>
Random matchmaking and pug forming are two different and valuable features with different audiences. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403952859902799873))<br>

Poll: Profession Perks<br>
Taking a look at one of the more interesting tweets we saw today, Ghostcrawler suggested the removal of profession perks. What would you like to see change (if anything) with profession perks in Warlords? Share your thoughts and suggest more poll options or new profession perks in the comments.<br>
<br>
Yesterday we revisited a poll (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3398-SoO-Progression-Heroic-Norushen-Changes-Blue-Tweets-Poll-PvE-Content-Fan-Art) about the best world PvE content after many people suggested that the allure of Timeless Isle would wear off in a month or two, but it looks like the results are almost the same (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3608-Armory-Stats-Player-Raid-Completion-Blue-Tweets-Poll-World-PvE-Content-Fan-Art) yet again. <br>
