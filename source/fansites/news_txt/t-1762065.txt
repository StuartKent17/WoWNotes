Patch 6.2 - Garrison Shipyards
Patch 6.2 adds Naval Missions to your garrison. You can't have Naval missions without ships, so there is also a new Shipyard being added to your garrison. The Shipyard is not a building and doesn't take up any existing slots or space in the garrison. 

Both the Alliance and Horde shipyards are placed near your initial arrival point to the zone. The Alliance can get to the shipyard by taking the new exit  that was added to their garrison. The Horde can take the existing back exit down to where the crashed ship was to get to their shipyard.

The Shipyard is unlocked by completing a short quest chain at the Iron Docks, accessible to anyone with a Level 3 Garrison. Vol'jin  / Varian  send you to the Iron Docks to recruit a Shipwright  You collect supplies  and break Roark out  of a prison train. After Roark is free, you reclaim his blueprints  and return to your garrison  to construct a shipyard  Currently it costs 5,000 garrison resource, but that is a placeholder value 

After unlocking your shipyard, you meet Solog at the dry docks  and build a Transport ship  Currently the ship costs 1,000 resources to build, but this may be another placeholder value. Once you have a ship, the Assault on Tanaan Jungle can begin!

Ship Models
Some new ship models have been added and some are reused from previous expansions.


   
 

    
 

    
  <!-- Model missing textures, yay devs -->


Missions
Ships have abilities that counter other abilities and traits, just like followers. Almost all of the missions are currently placeholders, but we can still get a look at the UI. A new NPC is added in your Town Hall that allows you to access Naval Missions, which require Oil  to complete.

Ship Equipment
Ships have two equipment slots, one of which is unlocked when the ship becomes epic quality.

Patch 6.2 - Spec Specific Trinkets
Along with the other trinkets  being added in Patch 6.2, Archimonde drops some trinkets that change effects based on your spec. Keep in mind that the procs aren't final.

Timewalker Dungeons
1: When tuning these timewalker dungeons, are you also taking into account that they're already faceroll when you're doing them while leveling even right now? Seriously, have you tried running Arcatraz at its intended level? Bosses usually die in 10 seconds or less. I don't want that to be the kind of experience you get with timewalking.
The item squish and other class changes over the years certainly have had an adverse effect on old dungeons. 

Our QA team is in the process of playing through the Timewalking versions and we look forward to PTR feedback as well. What we'll likely do is continue to adjust the item leveling scaling until we feel that the dungeons are appropriately tuned. We'll also be looking out for any strange outliers in mechanics and such.

2: Is there any chance this feature could be expanded to raids? Most of the raids before WotLK saw very little of the player population doing them because of the number of geared players required was too high for normal people. I'm personally hoping for Ahn'qiraj and Sunwell Plateau to be brought back somehow, even if only briefly.
This is still to be determined, but there are no plans for Timewalking raids in Patch 6.2. 5-player dungeons serve a significantly different purpose than do raids, and so we'd want to make sure we're not interfering with, or otherwise negatively affecting, Normal/Heroic/Mythic raid progression by adding an extra layer of "legacy" tiers.

We definitely want to focus on getting this introduction of Timewalking with TBC/Wrath dungeons in 6.2 right first, before we consider expanding it to include additional dungeons, or especially raids.

fair enough, but what happened to making new content? in the past, we would get a set of dungeons along with a new patch or raid tier: like ICC or DS. cant new dungeons be made, rather than recycling old ones? I like doing old content but it's still not bringing anything new to the table.
One of my points in my original post is that this isn't an either/or scenario. Creating a Timewalking system is entirely different from creating new 5-player dungeons, particularly in terms of artist resources. 

We love 5-player dungeons too. But they're also difficult to introduce in patches, as they take quite a lot of time to develop relative to their lifespan as relevant content, even when compared to new raid dungeons, which require weeks or months of progression for the average guild. Most players run through 5-player dungeons a small handful of times to get whatever upgrades are available and then move on. 

This is, in part, why we're introducing Mythic difficulty for 5-player dungeons in Patch 6.2. Most players feel a content gap between world content and raid content once they've run through the Heroic 5-player dungeons, and we feel that a Mythic difficulty in addition to the introduction of Timewalking dungeons will give players more progression options in small group content further into the lifespan of an expansion. 

At the same time, this frees up our artists more to create the creatures and environments needed for future content, which aids us in our efforts to reduce the gaps in between content updates.

Are the time walker dungeons being designed just for level 100 characters, or is the intent for the level 100 people to group with people leveling up through the content now? So e.g. Level 100s would join groups with characters level 70 for BC dungeons, etc?
The intent is to group together anyone queuing for Timewalking when available. So, level-70 characters will be matched with level-100 characters for TBC Timewalking dungeons, for instance. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 


Blizzcon 2015 - Eventbrite Issues
Message from Eventbrite
On Wednesday evening, we had incredible demand for BlizzCon tickets but unfortunately, our waiting room did not work as we had expected. While thousands of people were successful in securing a Blizzcon ticket, sadly, we let others down. Our team spent the rest of the week working on a fix that we thought would remedy the issue that some encountered on Wednesday so Blizzcon’s second onsale would be seamless.

Unfortunately, on Saturday morning we experienced significant site slowness during BlizzCon’s second onsale. We understand what a frustrating experience this was for those purchasing tickets.

At Eventbrite, we are completely committed to offering a smooth, pain-free ticketing experience for event attendees and organizers alike. This week, we were not successful in providing that experience and on behalf of all of us at Eventbrite, we’d like to apologize to the entire Blizzard community. We take issues like this very seriously, and in the coming days, our team will be looking into what caused these situations so we can remedy for future onsales. Official Forums 

Message from Blizzard
Just want to say to everyone who ran into issues when purchasing or trying to purchase tickets: we share your frustration and are sorry that the experience did not live up to expectations. Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback. We are evaluating options for future online ticket sales to help ensure a smoother overall process. Official Forums
