Boubouille2007-05-15, 09:39 AMRetribution http://www.retributionguild.net/ guys were on the PTR yesterday. After getting both Najentus and Supremus sub 20%, a GM requested their help tuning the Shade of Akama encounter. After a few attempts, they got a working strategy down and within an hour had him dead.
