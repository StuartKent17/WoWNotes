Mythic Item Level
I've seen most groups ask for people at 305 to 315ish that's just my experience though and I can see people asking for higher. 

Honestly they're very doable under 300 as long as you can follow mechanics and figure out some strats with your group.

If I was doing a World Tour with all pugs, I would aim to have the group be all 320.
I would ask for something similar if we were doing a World Tour. Some of the dungeons are a bit harder than the others and can be pretty challenging at lower ilvls but for the most part they're pretty doable and similar to the heroic counterparts in difficulty. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
