Boubouille2010-03-08, 09:29 PMPatch 3.3.3 - PTR Build 11643
A new build has been deployed on test realms. So far it doesn't look like there are a lot of changes out there but stay tuned, test realms can be full of surprises! 

Pets / Mounts
Lil' XT http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75906/lil-xt/ finally got its own model, the name is VERY similar to Lil' K.T. http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69677/lil-k-t/ and it wouldn't be surprising to see this pet appear on the Blizzard Store at some point.
