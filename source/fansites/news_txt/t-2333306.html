World of Warcraft Interview Recaps<br>
Lots of interviews took place at BlizzCon, so we are starting with some recaps today!<br>
<br>
Trade Chat Interview with Alex Afrasiabi and Chris Robinson<br>
Tradechat (https://www.youtube.com/user/TradeChat) sat down with Alex Afrasiabi and Chris Robinson to discuss Battle for Azeroth (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7117-BlizzCon-2017-World-of-Warcraft-What-s-Next).<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Dungeon bosses will consist of threats outside the Horde and Alliance conflict.<br>
Faction conflict is the foreground and the outside threats are a slow build up in this expansion.<br>
Redoing Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms again was an option, however, team realized the narrative was tied to level and decided to use sharding tech to change existing zones for characters 110 and above.<br>
Team wanted players to connect with the faction and who they are before the events of Battle for Azeroth so you have a connection to what unfolds.<br>
Sharding allows team to take tangible and meaningful places in the world and update them with what is happening in the story.<br>
Flying will unlock in a similar way to Legion and Warlords. Team wants players to get familiarity with the world before being able to fly. They learned from Legion though and will tweak it as needed.<br>
No plans to have followers or missions at the moment. Team doesn&apos;t want to hold on to something for the sake of holding on to it. They want it to work with the story and new content.<br>
World quests will extend to the continent not explored by your faction. (i.e Horde: Kul Tiras and Alliance: Zandalar)<br>
New World PVP concept could allow (tentatively) for things like bounties in which the longer and more dangerous you become on the opposite faction&apos;s continent, the more the other faction is alerted to your presence and encouraged to take you down. (Might not happen)<br>
New AI allows players who don&apos;t PVP to experience what PVP is like without fighting actual players.<br>
Brawls will continue, but not sure on how much it will be expanded.<br>
Soloing old content will still be fine with the scaling tech, however, one expansion back could still pose a challenge.<br>
Classic servers are still super early in development and so not much is known outside of them happening.<br>
Allied races are super fun and people will be pleased with them!<br>
Player characters act as heroes from Wacraft 3 in Warfronts<br>

Taliesin and Evitel Interview World of Warcraft producers Ray Cobo and Shani Edwards<br>
Taliesin and Evitel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiHdR2hAyFEXWCbNQgbu_Dg) interviewed producers Ray Cobo and Shani Edwards.<br>

<br>
<br>
No plans for mobile support for Battle for Azeroth at the moment<br>
Azerite is similar to artifact power for this expansion<br>
No plans for paid loot boxes in WoW right now<br>
Circles on the Heart of Azeroth can alternate between damage/healing and utility. Abilities are hand crafted so there isn&apos;t much RNG in what you have as options.<br>
Every item in a slot that has the same name will have the same ability options. The higher the ilvl, the better the abilities.<br>
No plans for getting your own boat.<br>
<br>
<br>
FinalBoss Interviews Ion And Alex<br>
FinalBoss (http://finalboss.tv/) sat down with Ion and Alex for an interview as well. Here are the highlights:<br>

<br>
<br>
Team is looking into tweaking the frequency in which warforging/titanforging occurs.<br>
Allied races will get full character kits: their own emotes, their own flirts, funnies, exertions, etc.<br>
Ideally our current legendaries will taper off in their power as you level towards 120. By the time you reach max level, you will want to replace them with better, newer gear.<br>
It would be nice to make flying possible and no loading screen for Silvermoon City but it is not currently slated for the BfA release.<br>
Team is trying to figure out how to deal with Allied races being hero classes. They are talking about allowing Dark Iron Dwarves to be Death Knights.<br>
It&#x2019;s possible that there will be some form of missions moving forward. However, it won&#x2019;t be a central feature like in Warlords.<br>
The faction divide is key to the game. That is what makes Warcraft Warcraft. It is not expected to be broken in the future.<br>
They have talked about plans for Wrathion for various other things, but currently have no plans for him in BfA.<br>
As of now, Warfronts are PVE only.<br>
For some classes, their artifact abilities will be incorporated into the spec as baseline or a talent. Others will be eliminated altogether.<br>
There is a prevalence of immunities/defensives and the team wants to revisit these and make changes where it makes sense.<br>
No plans to re-envision the Moonkin model as of now.<br>
No class changes as drastic as Survival Hunters are being planned at this time.<br>
The story will definitely build up to a major threat. It will be a &#x2018;slow burn&#x2019; that escalates as the expansion progresses.<br>
The profession rank system is likely staying. The amount of quest content tied to them may go down, however.<br>
They want to give players options to customize their gear and keep crafting relevant.<br>
Arcane Torrent and Rocket Jump are being looked at for a re-design.<br>
<br>

Artifact Ability and next expansion<br>
We haven&apos;t nailed down the specifics on which artifact abilities and traits will be carried forward into the next expansion, though we have heard from players that some traits feel like core parts of their rotation now. So, where possible (and feasible), we will be looking into carrying over those traits as talents or passives. Note, this doesn&apos;t mean that everything will be carried forward.<br>
<br>
Look for more specifics on this as we head into beta which, before you ask, I don&apos;t have a date for yet either. Soon&#x2122;<br>
