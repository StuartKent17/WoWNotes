<br>
<br>
<br>
This post will be updated every few minutes / hours depending on how successful we are at spotting changes. <br>
<br>
Thursday April 24th<br>
A new PvP Trinket as been added to Honor Rewards Medallion of the Alliance (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/epicpvptrinket.jpg). There is obviously a horde version of the item and both of them cost 40 000 Honor Points. <br>
Epic gems are still sold by Shaani for 15 Badges (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/gem15badge.jpg) on PTRs ! This could mean that the official armory showing 10 badges was an error.<br>
The Quest &quot;The Multiphase Survey (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/multispectral.jpg)&quot;, where you retrieve surveys from Nagrand, no longer gives a [item=35232].<br>
Added screenshots for most of the item changes, also added the new stats for Naturalist&apos;s Preserving Cinch (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/naturalistcinch.jpg) and Borderland Fortress Grips (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/borderlandgrips.jpg)<br>
Added a screenshot for the new Theramore/Stonard portal spells (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/newportals.jpg)<br>
<br>

<br>
Wednesday April 23rd<br>
22:35 CEST - Actually, it looks like new items related to mount &quot;enchantments&quot; are indeed here (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/carrotonastickv2.jpg) ... Maybe they just didn&apos;t replace the old ones.<br>
21:35 CEST - Added the stats of the Purified Shadowsong Amethyst (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/purifiedshadowsong2.jpg) (Reward from the Shattered Sun Offensive, Exalted reputation required)<br>
21:30 CEST - PTRs are now live and old trinkets (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/mountspeed.jpg) haven&apos;t been replaced with mount enchantments ![/b][/u] at this time we can assume they will be added later in the game and maybe we won&apos;t even see them before WotLK.<br>
16:50 CEST - Fixed the last errors with item links. <br>
16:45 CEST - Added professions changes, added a few details about the [item=11122] in 2.4.2<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
New Mounts<br>
According to spells and models available in the game files, at least two new mounts have been added to the game.<br>
<br>
Swift Zebra<br>
49322 : Swift Zebra - Summons and dismisses a rideable Swift Zebra. This is a very fast mount.<br>
<br>
Headless Horseman&apos;s Mount<br>
48023 : Headless Horseman&apos;s Mount - Summons and dismisses a rideable Headless Horseman&apos;s Mount.<br>
48024 : Headless Horseman&apos;s Mount, Ground - Summons and dismisses a rideable Headless Horseman&apos;s Mount.<br>
48025 : Use Headless Horseman&apos;s Reins<br>
<br>
The headless horseman mount &quot;,Ground&quot; effect could be the sign of a flying mount, but obviously nothing is confirmed yet. <br>

Mounts enchants<br>
According to the spells available in the game files, most of the trinkets used to boost your mount&apos;s speed have been changed to ... enchantments ! <br>
<br>
Old items aren&apos;t getting replaced on PTRs, there are only new items, and we still don&apos;t know if it&apos;s a feature from the 2.4.2 patch or not<br>
