Some pages will be very slow to load if you&apos;re the first one (lucky you !) to load them. Some pages will probably be bugged to hell, I&apos;ll try to fix them as soon as possible. <br>
<br>
Of course, I could do this on the test version of the site, but it wouldn&apos;t be fun. <br>
<br>
Final update : I&apos;ll fix the few bugged itemlinks, the enchantment list and the jewelcraft list will be fixed a bit later. (but not too much later)</div></div>
