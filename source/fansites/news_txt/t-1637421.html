Garrison Missions and Invasions<br>
Followers and Garrison Missions XP<br>
Thank you for the feedback on Garrison Follower missions. <br>
<br>
We&apos;re working on a hotfix that should increase the amount of lower level Garrison Missions being offered to players that have lower leveled Followers. (Blue Tracker[/b] (]Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15270569154?page=10#197))<br>

Garrison Invasions and You<br>
We&#x2019;ve been seeing a lot of confusion in regard to the way Garrison Invasions work and we wanted to take some time to clear up this confusion for you.<br>
<br>
Most players will get their first taste of what Invasions will be like when they get into Tier 2 of their Garrison. Approximately midway through Frostfire Ridge or Shadowmoon Valley, a player&#x2019;s Garrison will be attacked either by a Thunderlord or Shadowmoon force. The quest is just a taste of what this type of gameplay offers but it&#x2019;s not a full blown invasion just yet. It&#x2019;s a way to get your feet wet and experience just a bit of what it will be like when you reach max level. For those who move quickly into their 3rd tier before getting this event, don&#x2019;t worry. You haven&#x2019;t missed out on any special rewards. It&#x2019;s just a precursor to what you&#x2019;re going to get to experience at maximum level.<br>
<br>
Once you reach max level, these events are triggered organically. What this means is, as you fight powerful foes among the enemy factions of Draenor (generally in and around the areas for Apexis Crystal Missions) you&#x2019;ll draw their attention and an enemy force will eventually prepare to attack your Garrison. When that happens, the commander outside your Town Hall will have a quest for you, allowing you to trigger the invasion.<br>
<br>
The Nuts and Bolts:<br>
<br>
Your effectiveness in defending your Garrison is measured by how many enemies you&#x2019;re able to defeat and how many of your guards and buildings survive the assault. (Don&#x2019;t worry, there&#x2019;s no permanent damage- they will rebuild it!) You can bring up to 2 friends into your Garrison to assist in the defense. (It&#x2019;s like a party, but with heavily armored invaders.) Based on your final score you and your allies present will earn a Bronze, Silver, and/or Gold award for your efforts &#x2013; each award may only be earned once per week.
