Windsong and Elemental Force Information
And DKs, since our Runeforges are superior to these enchants
Oh, oops, yes, them too. Sorry!

I suppose this brings up another question of mine. Does it dynamically update with haste procs?
Yes. The proc chance is determined based on the haste at the time of the damage/healing event. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/240336-windsong-and-elemental-force-information/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6893549789?page=5#90

PvP
Begging you to fix PvP. At least give the arena forums a glance over. 
The problem I've always found with PvP forums is subjectivity. It makes discussing actual problems hard. 

"Players who enjoy PvE shouldn’t feel forced to PvP to get the best gear, and vice versa." Where's the honor weapons then? 
Weapons are so attractive, that every PvE player would buy an Honor weapon. 

Why are 1h weapons 2,500 conquest when 2h weapons are 3,500 conquest? My Death Knight would have to spend 5,000 conquest to dual wield! 
Thinking of changing the 1H costs. 

Need more stuff to buy with honor. I'm capped and I have nothing to spend it on. Maybe more transmog gear, or battle pets? 
Agree with this. There needs to be another way to spend Honor. 

What's the reason for PvP vendors being in the wall? If i buy something i want to be near an AH to enchant, gem and reforge.
We thought the space looked cool and wanted the possibility of PvP combat around the vendors. 

What is being done about PvP Balance? MMR reset? Ladder Reset? Rating Decay? Self Healing? Instanct CC? 
We have a plan to keep high ranked folks still playing. Details require a format with more than 140 ch.
Why did you guys change your mind about resetting the MMR this season, or will you eventually reset it after balance changes? 
Want to make a blog on this -- we think there are better ways to get top players to keep playing than to keep resetting MMR. 
Yeah but are those "ways" not implemented yet? Everyone wanted MMR to get reset; including the top players 
Resetting = lots of unbalanced matches until MMRs return to their previous values, so a few weeks of pain with no long term gain. We have a better idea to handle folks who sit on high ratings that we'll talk about as soon as we are sure it works. 

I am not capable of doing the same damage as a raid level boss. And yet healers have their save the Main Tank heals in pvp? 
On the other hand, the boss tends to not stun you nearly as much as players do. 

So you nerfed our dispels and now your nerf our healing. What are we healers supposed to be in PvP for you, a punching-bag? 
There is a continuum between invulnerable and punching bag. A 15% healing debuff or even 30% isn't going to kill healing. 

Are you satisfied of the PVP ? Class had never been so unbalanced, BM hunter and warrior can one shot every class with macro 
Worried about BM hunter PvP burst. Warriors maybe. We agree war / hunter should be viable, but macro'ing all cooldowns together is neither fun, interesting nor skillful or good design. 
Nothing to worry about, really. BM aren't overpowered at all. 
We don't like the BM 'skill' macro, but WoW also has a storied history of videos that demo what their makers want them to demo. 
Don't get me wrong, it's fun, I'm just out of room to put spells on my bars. 
We did not do as great a job as we hoped at pruning abilities. Every candidate felt like a nerf or someone's favorite spell. 

Yep, actually MM is like unplayable, because of the damage, they are so weak in pvp actually. 
MMs damage is virtually identical to BM, SV. It just asks a lot more of the hunter. We could potentially simplify the rotation. 
In PvE maybe, but in PvP, MM is so lower than BM, which got a lay on hands with stampede heal x4 and which got an insane burst 
The Stampede heal is dumb. Other pet abilities are chilled out during Stampede. 
So the "Stampede Heal every 5 mins is dumb" but passive 3% per second regen under 35% isn't? SP OH's aren't? Get a clue, man. 
The big difference is those other two examples are intended. Stampede isn't supposed to be a massive heal. 
Stampede in PvP is a little much. Any plans for nerfs or disabling it from Arenas completely? Everything else is fine.
We think Stampede is ok, as long as it's not with Lynx Rush, Rabid and BRP. 
Do you think that Stampede lives up to the standard of other spells in WoW flavor wise? 
Hunters have been asking for it for years. 

Why are the PvP agi staves 2.00 speed? Why would a monk ever use it over the polearm? 
Monk damage is weapon speed agnostic. It might give you a slight autoattack boost, but that shouldn't mean no brainer. 

So aren't you going to fix BM hunters? 1 min CD ignores resilience and can be refreshed, warriors can be cc'd hunters no 
The answer might be that all cooldowns can't be popped at once.
