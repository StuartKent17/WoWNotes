Boubouille2007-08-18, 06:11 PMIt seems that the haste effect has been changed on the current version of the PTR. Keep in mind that it could be a test and it's not anywhere in the patch notes for the moment

Melee haste rating has been nerfed, and it now requires 15.76 points of haste to get 1% increased attack speed. Instead of 10.51 on the live servers

Ranged haste rating calculation is the same as Melee.

Spell haste rating has been upgraded, and it now requires 15.76 points of haste to get 1% increased cast speed. Instead of 21 on the live servers

If you want to check your haste rating on both PTR and Live servers, you can use the two following commands :

Melee haste rating
/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessageGetCombatRatingBonus18

Ranged haste rating
/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessageGetCombatRatingBonus19

Spell haste rating
/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessageGetCombatRatingBonus20

You should get a % value in your chatbox like in the following examples.
