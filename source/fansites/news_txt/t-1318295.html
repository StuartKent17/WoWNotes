Patch 5.4 -Skeletal Warhorse and Warsaber Mounts<br>
Patch 5.4 adds two new PvP mounts, the http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/102533.jpg Reins of the Vicious Skeletal Warhorse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/102533-reins-of-the-vicious-skeletal-warhorse) and http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/102514.jpg Reins of the Vicious Warsaber (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/102514-reins-of-the-vicious-warsaber). <br>
<br>
Currently, the mounts are sold by Netharian (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/73151-netharian). on the PTR for a http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/102535.jpg Vicious War Saddle (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/102535-vicious-war-saddle), but it isn&apos;t very clear where those come from yet though, as we saw two different answers on the same day from two developers:<br>

Patch 5.4 In Game Store Update<br>
It looks like the Asian regions will be the first to be able to purchase faster leveling and Lesser Charms!<br>
Thanks for all the feedback so far, everyone. We&#x2019;re still pretty early in the exploration process, but we did want to go into more detail about our rationale for introducing an in-game store, as well as provide some insight into what you might ultimately see available there.<br>
<br>
For players who are already interested in the in-game items we offer, such as Pet Store pets and mounts, the benefits of an in-game store are pretty clear. We think everyone would appreciate the convenience of being able to make such purchases without having to leave the game, and ultimately that&#x2019;s our long-term goal for the system, though there&#x2019;s quite a bit of work involved in retrofitting those existing items into the new system. <br>
<br>
First, we&#x2019;ll be testing the in-game store with some new kinds of items we&#x2019;re looking into introducing (in Asian regions, at the outset) based on player feedback: specifically, an experience buff to assist with the leveling process (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/146939-enduring-elixir-of-wisdom), as well as an alternate way to acquire Lesser Charms of Good Fortune (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/738-lesser-charm-of-good-fortune). We&#x2019;ve had a lot of requests from players in different regions for convenience-oriented items such as these, and as with other new ideas we&#x2019;ve introduced as WoW has evolved&#x2014;including Pet Store pets, mounts, and more&#x2014;your feedback plays a hugely important part in determining what we add to the game.<br>
<br>
Ultimately it&#x2019;s still too early in the process to make any final determinations about our plans, but in the meantime, we hope you&#x2019;ll check out the in-game store once it&#x2019;s implemented on the PTR and let us know what you think. <br>

Legendary Cloak Effects and Druid/Warlock Forms<br>
As the legendary spell effects are tied to the procs and not the cloak graphics themselves, they will still display even if your cloak is hidden. That includes Druid forms.<br>

How&apos;s it work with Meta for demo locks I wonder? I&apos;d love to know it&apos;s all gonna be smooth sailing <br>
I haven&apos;t confirmed Meta form specifically, but I don&apos;t see why it wouldn&apos;t work.<br>
<br>
Will players that haven&apos;t been doing the quests or chose to level a new character have a chance at getting these cloaks? <br>
You won&apos;t get them quite as quickly as someone who&apos;s already on the most recent step of the quest chain when 5.4 releases, but we do have plans to shorten the amount of time it takes to &quot;catch up.&quot; We made similar changes for the 5.0 steps of the chain when 5.2 launched.

<br>
Legendary Cloak and Transmogrification<br>
How many of you are concerned that legacy legendaries will become the new Paladin Tier 2, in that everyone and his dog will be equipping them? Wouldn&apos;t it somehow ruin the novelty of owning these items when you get to see them being used constantly, even by levelling characters? Alright, I guess the argument for items that aren&apos;t available anymore is a little stronger in my eyes. <br>
<br>
But hey, we&apos;re not ruling it out completely&#x2014;one day, who knows? We purposefully made it very limited when transmogrification started, so we could maybe open things up further down the road. I&apos;ve seen plenty of people argue against this is all.<br>
<br>
I mean, allowing players to transmog into legendaries isn&apos;t gonna automatically increase the number of players having, say, Thunderfury <br>
Are you sure? One of the reasons I&apos;ve never gone for the Twin Blades of Azzinoth is because I know I wouldn&apos;t be able to show them off constantly. All that work for a few minutes posing in Stormwind? But if I could transmogrify them, I&apos;d be in BT every waking moment trying for those things, and I think there&apos;d be a few more like me. Just a guess, of course. At least now when you see someone taking those few minutes to /flex in the city with those awesome old school legendaries, you&apos;re impressed. Well, I am.

Patch 5.4 Hunter Updates<br>
As I&apos;ve mentioned before, we&apos;re still discussing Hunter concerns. When we have an update, we will share it.<br>
I said this 5 days ago, before a holiday weekend. We haven&apos;t somehow jumped ahead several weeks in development while everyone&apos;s been out of the office.<br>
<br>
I know it can be frustrating to be patient, but that&apos;s just how our development process works. We&apos;re still pretty early in that process. As I&apos;ve mentioned before, balance tuning typically takes place towards the end of the PTR cycle. Hunter sustained DPS in the wake of the Readiness nerf is a concern that we&apos;re well aware of and fully intend to fix -- when we get to that point.<br>
<br>
For clarity: we know there are other issues than just Readiness. Arcane Shot vs Kill Command is one such issue that, again, we intend to fix. I will make sure to bring up the other concerns to the team as well.<br>
<br>
He can be our man on the inside and a champion for our class. It would be risky and challenging, but, if he cares about this game and us, he absolutely should do it. If I could walk down the hall and force Greg to hear these issues I would do so in a heartbeat. <br>
This is starting to get pretty off-topic, and I apologize, but I want to be clear: this is exactly what I do. Daily. For every class. My job as a World of Warcraft Community Representative, as it turns out, is to represent the community. I take my job very seriously. We all do.<br>
<br>
I know all too well how frustrating it can be when you&apos;re concerned about something and it appears that we&apos;re being silent. I was in those shoes myself until very recently. Just please be aware that silence isn&apos;t necessarily a bad thing. In many cases, including this one, it means we&apos;re still actively discussing things and just don&apos;t have anything we&apos;re comfortable sharing yet.<br>
<br>
We really do appreciate all of the feedback, both on Hunter concerns as well as how we can communicate better. This thread in particular should probably stick to Hunter concerns, but I want to be the very best (like no one ever was) and can always work to improve how we interact with you guys.<br>
<br>
Alright, I have a few updates, followed by a request. Here&#x2019;s what the developers are currently thinking about several of the issues brought up in this thread:<br>
<br>
Regarding Stampede: We&#x2019;re happy with the damage it&#x2019;s currently putting out in PvP. For PvE, we&#x2019;re planning to buff its damage pretty heavily, so it becomes a substantially more potent DPS cooldown. We don&#x2019;t want to give it any more utility than it has now, for reasons we&#x2019;ve explained at length already.<br>
<br>
Readiness is still under heavy discussion, and we haven&#x2019;t made a final decision on what we&#x2019;re going to do with it in 5.4. At the moment, we&#x2019;re leaning towards just removing the ability entirely and giving the affected abilities shorter cooldowns or charges to compensate. If we end up taking that route, we will buff Hunter damage (most likely across the board, not just specific abilities), but as I mentioned, we&#x2019;re still discussing.<br>
<br>
Murder of Crows vs Blink strike is also still under heavy discussion. Our goal (with all talents) is that active abilities used properly will outperform passive ones. We haven&#x2019;t decided yet what adjustments we&#x2019;ll make to achieve that in 5.4.<br>
<br>
Scatter/Silencing Shot: We don&#x2019;t consider interrupts to be mandatory in PvE. If a Hunter would rather not take the Glyph of Scattered Thoughts, there are plenty of other players in the raid who could take on the responsibility. We like Silencing Shot as a Marksman perk overall, but we&#x2019;re still discussing things. We may end up making a baseline Interrupting Shot that gets upgraded to Silencing Shot if you spec Marksman.<br>
<br>
Speaking of spec differences, we agree that Hunter rotations feel cooler when your signature shots do a lot more damage than other shots, and we&#x2019;ll discuss that some more. That&#x2019;s part of the reasoning behind the Arcane Shot changes &#x2013; our hope is that saving up more Focus for a bigger hit will feel better than firing off smaller shots more regularly. <br>
<br>
As to overall Hunter performance and utility, we don&#x2019;t think the issues are with the Hunter class specifically. Instead, we think that certain other classes are overperforming (in both) at the moment. Fixing those outliers will, in turn, make a good Hunter more attractive for their raid spot. You may have seen some (but not all) changes along those lines on the PTR already.<br>
<br>
Pet pathing errors are unfortunately extremely difficult to fix. A lot of the time, the problem isn&#x2019;t with the pet AI but with the environment or encounter. That means there&#x2019;s no blanket fix here; we have to resolve every such error individually. When reporting these problems, it&#x2019;s most helpful to be very specific. &#x201C;My pet has trouble getting to the boss during this phase transition on this encounter&#x201D; allows us to reproduce the issue and come up with a fix. &#x201C;My pet is dumb&#x201D; does not.<br>
<br>
Which brings me to my request. This thread has a lot of great feedback put together by a good handful of Hunters who just want their class to be fun &#x2013; which is amazing! The issue is that, in order to find those helpful posts, we have to dig through hundreds of other posts that contain no helpful information whatsoever (and instead focus on how class X got more blue posts this week, or employee Y must just hate Hunters, etc.). There&#x2019;s always going to be some of that, and we expect as much, but this thread has been particularly out of hand.<br>
<br>
I&#x2019;m not bringing that up because it hurts my feelings or whatever. That sort of thing doesn&#x2019;t really affect me. I&#x2019;m bringing it up because it makes it incredibly difficult for us to figure out what you&#x2019;re actually upset about. When we have to sift through so much noise just to find something we can actually bring up in our meetings and discuss, the end result is that we have less to talk about in our meetings. I&#x2019;m sure there are still some concerns that I didn&#x2019;t address above &#x2013; if that&#x2019;s the case, it&#x2019;s 100% because they got lost in the pile. That sucks.<br>
<br>
So please, try to keep things constructive. You&#x2019;re only hurting yourselves and your fellow Hunters otherwise. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/263649-readiness-nerf-and-hunter-pve-pt2/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9377368613?page=35#697))<br>
