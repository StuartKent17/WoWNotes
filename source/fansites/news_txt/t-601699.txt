Boubouille2007-08-08, 06:28 PMIf you took the time to read Blizzcon changes list, you probably noticed this part :
Season 1 gear will be available through honor system when the season 3 starts.



Good news, they'll be cheap according to this blue post :

Somewhere around 15k honor per piece.

Keep in mind that they won't be available until the season 3, and it's merely a way to keep everyone geared at a decent level I guess.
