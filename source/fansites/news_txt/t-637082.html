A new build will be deployed on PTRs tonight, stay tuned for possibly more patch 3.1.0 changes!<br>
Good Morning,<br>
<br>
The PTR realms will be coming down for maintenance today at 11:00am PST. There will be a new patch available to download once the realm maintenance has finished. This patch will only be able to be applied by players that have upgraded their accounts to Wrath of the Lich King. If you do not currently have an account that is upgraded to WotLK, you will be unable to connect to the PTR during this testing phase.<br>
<br>
This thread will be updated when an ETA is available for when the realms will be up again.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your patience in this matter.</div></div>
