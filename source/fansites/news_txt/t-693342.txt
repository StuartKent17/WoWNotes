Boubouille2010-02-04, 08:56 AMLich King Encounter Video by Blood Legion
Blood Legion  released a video of their Lich King kill in 10-man. Keep in mind that this is the 10-man normal mode version, I suggest that you wait for a video of the 25-man in heroic mode to see how hard/impressive the encounter can be. 

Important - Players are randomly sent to the Frostmourne room during the encounter, sadly the player frapsing the fight wasn't teleported this time. You will have to wait another video to see this part of the fight.
