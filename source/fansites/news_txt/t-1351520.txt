Patch 5.4 Raid Finder and Flex Drop Rates
Now that we have a few weeks worth of data on WoWDB , we can talk a little bit about the Raid Finder and Flex difficulty drop rates.

World Boss Drop Rates

Celestials  - 21% item drop rate. The Celestial Treasure Box  drops 79% of the time.

Nalak  - 18% item drop rate. The Stormtouched Cache  dropped 82% of the time. 

Ordos  - 15% item drop rate. The Flame-Scarred Cache of Offerings  dropped 85% of the time.

Oondasta  - 19% drop rate. The Shiny Pile of Refuse  dropped 81% of the time.
Galleon  - 17% item drop rate. The Marauder's Gleaming Sack of Gold  dropped 83% of the time.



Raid Boss Drop Rates

Siege of Orgrimmar Raid Finder - 25% item drop rate. The Twisted Treasures of the Vale  and Coalesced Turmoil  drop 75% of the time.

Throne of Thunder Raid Finder Pre Patch 5.4 - ~16% item drop rate. The Treasures of the Thunder King  dropped ~84% of the time. 

Siege of Orgrimmar Flex - 25% item drop rate. The Twisted Treasures of the Vale  and Coalesced Turmoil  drop 75% of the time.



Siege of Orgrimmar Heroic Progression
Method  and Blood Legion  are leading progress with 13/14 bosses down now, followed by six other guilds at 12/14. Over in the 10 player column, Paragon  is still leading with 13/14 bosses down.


  


Upcoming Pet Changes
We have a few hotfixes to share with you and these changes should be in game now, or will take effect once the realms have been restarted:


Pierre  and Rascal-Bot  are no longer Bind on Pickup; they can now be caged and you can collect up to 3 of each.
Rascal-Bot's Phaser spell is now a one-round ability. The tooltip still erroneously states that it is a two-round ability which we plan to correct at a later date.
Jadefire Spirit's Fade ability now has an eight-round cooldown.

Raid Finder Difficulty
You would think with all this LFR SoO complaints that Blizzard would get the message but they're still in denial... 
You may have missed my second post  Or are you dismissing a lack of immediate change and specific hotfix notes as indifference? 

This guy gets it. You don't make people better players by smoothing to road for them. You do it by handing them a shovel and saying "here's the tools, fix it yourself". 
That's an unfortunately common outlook, that if you just made stuff harder for people they'd aspire to greatness. But we know that's not how it works for everyone, or how all people respond to challenges, or necessarily what everyone is even looking for in their entertainment. We're getting into social commentary territory which I'd like to avoid, but let's dismiss the notion that any of us "know what's best" for any other person, and instead accept their preferences as absolutely valid, and think and discuss about what the issues and solutions are from that viewpoint instead of focusing on how to tell other people they're enjoying their game incorrectly.

Patch 5.4 and Deterrence
I understand why there would be some confusion about Deterrence's function in 5.4. And yes, it's a nerf in cases where you were using it more or less on cooldown every minute for longer than about 4 minutes. 

However, in cases where you'd like to use it more than once inside a 1-minute period, the new Deterrence is a significant buff. Previously, that couldn't be done without using Readiness, and the vast majority of players weren't saving Readiness for Deterrence.

It's different now, sure, but we like how the new version is working. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Why don't you make all raid modes share the same lockout? That way they won't have to hate such an awesome feature. 
We like the idea that e.g. a HC guild could run a flex on another night for those folks who care about achievements. Source 
FWIW, in 5.0 when my old guild was dead, LFR was the only way I was able to run those raids. So I am all for it
I am a HC raider, but if I log on an alt at 10 AM on a Sun, I don't want to have to look for guildies. LFR works great for that. Source 

Do you think that this bias towards / insistence on larger raids leads to overemphasizing AE heals as a necessary consequence?
In 10s it's easier to coordinate and 25s easier to specialize, which leads to just doing one thing over and over. Source 
I believe 25s are more fun personally and think better for the game strategically, but concede healing more fun in 10s. Source 
I feel 10s are better socially. 25 is too many people I don't know well enough to care about or listen to.
Some truth to that, but 10s also have to be more selective & are less resilient to losing folks. In that way, 25s good for social. Source 
seems the changes your making 10 man's are becoming worthless and second place to 25 man raids. how long b4 10 mans are gone
10s are in no danger of going anywhere. 25s remain in danger despite the advantages you are worried about. Source 

so the next xpac will be another cataclysm, you had this talk before that launch about difficulty and need to change
No, the problem with Cat was there was no alternatives to HC dungeons. As I said, exclusive is fine as long as alternative exist. Source 
That has me worried. The early cata zones is what made me leave last time!
Zones meaning the outdoor leveling content or dungeons? The discussion was about dungeons.... Source 

does the vast diversity of player skill pose problems in content design?
Absolutely. Often players can use gear which is generally a function of time invested to help make up the difference. Source 

Why not open heroics first week so heroic guilds dont load up on Ngear with multiple raids and the tiers last a little longer?
Seeing the encounters for one week in normal helps us catch last minute problems. Source 
Imagine first kill of a heroic boss was 60 sec without cheating. Do we then buff the boss? Do we strip them of their kill? Source 

If organized gameplay is "the heart and soul" of wow, why is only a minority part of this "heart and soul"?
Queuing for random matchmaking is very convenient. Our concern is that those players burn out quickly without social connections. Source 

why the hell can i get a cloak off ordos when you need a legendary cloak to even fight him. Waste of a drop.
You can access Ordos if any character on your account has a cloak I believe. Source 


WoWDB Addon Data Collection
Collecting data on things like the 5.4 drop rates is done with the help of thousands of players. The more people that contribute data, the more accurate and quickly we can update the database. 

To help out, just click here curse://enable-wowdb-upload if you have Curse Client already installed. 

When you are playing the addon will gather data and save it. When you are done playing, Curse Client will see the game close and upload the collected data from the addon. You can see the last time data was uploaded by looking in the Plugins tab of the options, as well as making sure the addon is enabled there. If you don't normally leave it open, be sure you open Curse Client once in a while so that the data will upload
