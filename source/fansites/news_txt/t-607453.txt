Official forums avatars & rogues
Woops! I meant T5, but yeah rogues are in T4, maybe the web artists thought T5 was too dark/bland to set the icons apart. In any case your armory is a click away so I wouldn't worry about a forum icon too much. Before Lich King comes out I'm betting there will be new icons for level 80 and everyone will be in Tier 7. We have no plans to update the icons before that time. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=6286802685&pageNo=1&sid=1#6
