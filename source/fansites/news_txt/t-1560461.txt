Comic-Con visitors got another teaser for the Warcraft movie this year, but no footage has appeared as of yet. For now we have a short description thanks to comingsoon , SlashFilm , ScreenRant , IGN , and io9 io9:


The movie focuses on the origin of conflict between Humans and Orcs in Azeroth.
The story should be accessible to everyone, not just Warcraft fans.
A human Travis Fimmell  wearing Alliance themed armor is up first. He wonders if he is a fool for spending so much time protecting his king and so little protecting his son.
An orc was up next, noting that he had led thousands of warriors into battle but fears becoming a father, wondering if that makes him a leader or a coward.
A giant throne, armory, green sky, gryphon, and other Warcraft elements appear in the teaser.
Magic and melee fighting occur between the Orcs and Humans. Ben Foster  appears as Medivh.
SlashFilm  mentioned the Orcs are already Lord of the Rings quality, but ScreenRant  mentions that they look far from finished. 
Everyone seems to agree that the scenery looks great!
