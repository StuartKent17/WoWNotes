On 17th of September at approximately 10:30 Sydney time, guild 'Not Steamboat http://www.notsteamboat.com/' achieved an Oceanic first of slaying the end boss of content as we know it, Illidan Stormrage. Not Steamboat NSB are located on the Oceanic server Aman'Thul and raid five days a week for four hours each day. And they are recruiting

Also, Sanctus who contacted me added a few interesting thoughs in his mail : 
The main reason for this email is mostly due to the fact of gaining a unique representation amongst the US servers and EU servers. There are only eight oceanic servers in total and in all progression and new content release cases, oceanic servers is grouped with the US servers as a whole.

We believe australia and fellow oceanic countries have a strong and commited player base and deserve servers located in the oceanic region so we can have pings equal to those of our competitors around the world. We constantly raid with 400ms, this would be considered 'horrible lag' by those who live in the US that get pings of less then 100.


Farming Skettis trees in 2.2
I was reading this post on the forum, and someone asked if it wouldn't be better to farm the elite trees of Skettis instead of running slave pens to get ancien lichens ? 
Good news : It's probably better yes.
Bad news : As far as I know and according to a mail I received, you can't "gather" these trees anymore in 2.2. 


Website
Mail server is still down, as well as a few other things, you probably won't notice it most of the time anyway except if you are trying to reach the site without using the "www.", hopefully it will be fixed today.
