Glyph of Fel-Touched Shards
A note on this, as it may be the cause of the confusion here - 

We had a bug in 7.3 that caused the Glyph of Ember Shards http://www.wowdb.com/items/151538-glyph-of-ember-shards to be converted to Glyph of Fel-Touched Shards http://www.wowdb.com/items/151542-glyph-of-fel-touched-shards in the Inscription window. While we worked on a fix, we temporarily disabled Inquisitor Vethroz http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/126946-inquisitor-vethroz from dropping the new Glyph of Fel-Touched Shards recipe http://www.wowdb.com/items/151543-technique-glyph-of-fel-touched-shards. We’ve now hotfixed the Glyph of Ember Shards back for people who had it in 7.2.5, and scribes can use the recipe dropped from Kil’jaeden again. We’ve also added Glyph of Fel-Touched Shards back as a drop from Inquisitor Vethroz when he next spawns.

Unfortunately we were not able to restore Glyph of Fel-Touched Shards to scribes who had it legitimately from the rare prior to us disabling the drop. However, all scribes should be able get it relatively quickly from Inquisitor Vethroz on Argus.

Thank you for your patience on this issue! Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1072155-fel-touched-shards/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759006092?page=1#4

Hello there, is artifact power still good for anything after maxing all weapons or can I get rid of a bank full of ap?
The Concordance trait in your Artifacts can be purchased with Artifact Power nearly indefinitely. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/907373212601745410

Does netherlight crucible work in arena now? 
The baseline item-level increase will have a minimal impact on your total item-level. Additional relic traits will not be active. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/907373552680108032
