Dev Watercooler: Pruning the Garden of War Twitter Q&A
Celestalon  and Holinka  answered some questions on Twitter that arose from the Watercooler posted earlier tonight 
Future Blog Posts
You're better off making a blue post about racials/class abilities rather than tweets. Info overload! future watercooler?
Working on it, just wasn't ready in time, and didn't want to delay the blog post. Source 

To those /sadpanding at the blog, you're not after the philosophy. You're after the patch notes which still aren't available yet. Rygarius 

Alliance Racials
Humans lose the Mace   racials. The Human Spirit  becomes +X to two secondary stats of your choice. Source 
Change to Human Spirit seems really cool. Can you talk about the interface for choosing which secondary stats it'll give you?
Still designing it. Probably a flyout button of some sort like Rogue Poisons, Mage Portals, etc Source 
The idea is interesting, but are you worried it will be too strong since it's customizable? Or just needs proper tuning
The downside is that it's split between two. If haste is your best stat, 1% haste is better than 0.5%haste + 0.5% crit. Source 

Weapon Specialization racials are removed because Hit/Exp are removed. Source 

Draenei's Heroic Presence  is now +X to your primary stat. Gift of the Naaru heals for the same amount but over 5sec. Source 

Night Elves' Quickness  also increases movement speed by 2% passively. They also got a new passive which is quite unique... Remember, no more haste breakpoints! Touch of Elune, a new passive which grants 1% Haste at night, 1% Crit during the day. Source 
Might annoy some specs that benefit from one stat but not another e.g. feral druids benefit from crit, but not haste
We're making sure that everyone benefits from them. Source 
Shadowmeld  is unchanged. Source 

Gnomes' Escape Artist  dropped to a 1min CD from 1.5min, and Shortblade Specialization became Nimble Fingers, 1% Haste. Also a tweak to Expansive Mind  Was +5% max Mana. Now +5% Max Mana, Energy, Rage, or Runic Power. Source 

Darkflight  is staying unchanged. Source 

Dwarves lost Crack Shot  and Mace Specialization  Gained Might of the Mountain, a passive which adds 2% Crit Damage and Healing. Also a change to Stoneform  Also removes Magic/Curse. HOWEVER, it still cannot be used while CC'd. It is still NOT a CC-break Source 

Horde Racials
Undead are seeing relatively few changes. Tweaks to the scaling rate of Touch of the Grave , and WotF  to 3min CD up from 2. Source 

Blood Elves gain Arcane Acuity, a 1% crit passive. Arcane Torrent now restores 20RunicPower, or 1HoPo, or 3% Mana. Also, Rage and Chi Source 

Orcs were one of the outliers we brought down. Lost the Axe Specialization , and Hardiness  is 10% Stun reduction down from 15%. Source 
Blood Fury  is unchanged. Every Man For Himself , we're still evaluating. Itemization changes may mean no nerf needed. Source 

Tauren's Endurance  becomes +X Stamina. Brawn is a new passive which increases Crit Damage/Healing by 2%. Source 

Can you tell us what exactly will be changing with the Troll racial Berserking 
Reduced to 15% Haste down from 20%. Source 

Will there be any changes to Worgen and Goblin racials?
Not much. They were about at baseline. Time is Money  becomes real 1% Haste, not just attack speed / cast speed. Subtle diff. Source 

Squish
Re the squish, simple yes/no question-- will noninstanced world bosses like Oondasta be soloable at level 100?
I'd be surprised if really skilled players didn't solo him at 100. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if a couple are close already. Source 

Any idea what enchants & set bonuses that currently reduce disarm duration will turn into?
We'll change the set bonuses but the weapon chains won't be relevant anymore. Source 

PvP
PvP trinkets now grant immunity to reapplication of an effect from the same spell= bad idea, everything else good.
You actually want to trinket a Solar Beam, and have it instantly reapply to you? Source 

"Long fears are now shorter in PvP due to the added benefit of a fear changing the players position." How short?
6sec instead of 8sec. Source 

Is paralyze dispellable? Like cyclone is going to be.
It's a physical effect, like gouge, so it can't be dispelled.
Cyclone is not a physical effect?
No it's magic
Magic in WoD, you mean? It's always been Physical CC.
It's more of a "behind the curtain" thing here. It's actually magic, it just isn't dispellable. Source 

Can we expect more relative damage in WoD with the reduced amount of cc?
We're reducing crit damage done to players by 25% i.e. crits do 150% damage against players. Damage will be more consistent. Source 

The blog doesn't mention abilities that break CC, which is significantly more powerful Lichborne, Fear Ward, TT, BRage..
In a world where we have too much CC and we're trying to tip the balance away, I can't see going after breaks as aggressively. Source 
What about mechanics like subterfuge/dematerialize? Those are really bad mechanics..
Subterfuge no longer leaves the rogue in stealth but provides the rogue access to stealth abilities. Source 
Will there be changes to all the root breaks that melee have now that they all share a DR and we have less instants?
Certainly concerned about all the root breaks. We haven't arrived at exactly what we want there yet.
What about interrupts? Skull bash/rebuke staying?
Interrupts are staying. We think their gameplay is more interesting than blanket silences. Source 
If interrupts dont have globalCD & casters dont cast a lot,then I disagree.Its just random, no-skill
Our other changes will mean a lot more casting, fewer instants. Source 
Will Interrupts remain off the GCD?
Yes, that's just a gameplay feel issue. Source 

Confused about "Removed Silence effects from interrupts." No more 3s lockout on kick?
No more silence on counterspell, spear hand strike, silencing shot, etc. Things that added a silence to an interrupt. But a spell that is specifically a silence, like, well Silence, isn't going away. Source 
So no more blanket silence as a CC unless Spriest?
There are others like Strangulate. Source 
Short silence, or wait for a cast for a longer interrupt. how is that not a choice?
Disagree. It feels like people more often use it to silence and the lock out ends up as a bonus. Source 
What about the "Spell locks"? Will Wind Shear still have a 2 sec lockout and will CS keep it's X secs?
Yeah, interrupts still lockout the interrupted spell school for X sec. Source 

Are you going to do some kind of pass with the goal of equalizing CC is some way? IE: Each class has like 1-2 CC spells?
Some classes will have more control than others. Source 

Are PvP set bonuses going to be reworked? I think it would be cool if they were really interesting like PvE bonuses.
Probably. Some classes rely on their set bonuses more than others. Source 

With the stat squish, number retuning, and CC changes are you looking to make PVP fights overall longer or shorter?
We'd like to see people rotting and healers having to triage more. No one likes 100-0 gameplay.
So overall it would take longer to die/kill someone, but it is also much harder to heal someone back to full?
That would be the goal Source 

Classes
Regarding removing CDs, which is likely gonna be cut for Ferals Berserk or Tiger Fury or both?
Both of those are staying. Tiger's Fury is on the border between feeling like a DPS cooldown and a rotational button. Keeping it because it has significant impact on your rotation; good gameplay. Source 

So the 197 of CJL's damage 6 * 197 + 1 [1.2] * Attack power * 0.386 is going away?
Correct, no more base damage on spells. Source 

Does "One type of ability that we focused on removing is temporary power buffs aka "cooldowns"" mean hero/lust/windfury/etc?
We're keeping Bloodlust/Heroism as the only raid-wide throughput cooldown. No more Stormlash/SkullBanner. Time Warp, Ancient Hysteria stay. We count those all as the same thing, just different sources of the same buff.Source 
When are we getting those changed from Haste to Amp? Makes much better sense as raid cooldown
Based on our experiments with the SoO trinkets, we're holding off on doing Amp and Cleave as stats, at least for now. Source 
Plans for a different new secondary to take its place then? DPS could use more options. I know readiness+multistrike
Crit/Haste/Mastery/Readiness/Multistrike. We think 5 is enough for now. Will make sure none are terrible. Source 

What of the Raid Wide CDs, other than Bloodlust, like devotion aura?
Defensive cooldowns stay. May tweak them of course, but as a concept they stay. Only offensive one will be Bloodlust etc. Source 
Wait, the ONLY offensive cooldown will be Hero/BL/etc? Every other one is gone?
No, only *raid-wide* offensive cooldown is Bloodlust. I'm referring to removing Stormlash and Skull Banner. Source 

I'm worried that class flavour spells are going to vanish. Things that don't take up keybind space, like Enslave Demon/Undead.
We're less concerned about removing those Source 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Death Knights' runeforges. Anything new there, yet?
Couple tweaks, but nothing ready to announce yet. Not an overhaul. Source 

DKs don't fit in a world with fewer CCs.They r essentially gonna become immune CC.other than slow/root
Then root them? Source 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Can you still NS healing abilities? or is NS just going completely?
You can NS all other spells. Source 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
What about Silence/Counter Shot for Hunters. How will you go about changing these?
Counter Shot stays, Silencing Shot goes Source 

NS Clone/PoM poly gone is a good change. Wyvern Sting gone as well I presume?
Wyvern is still available. Hunters have had other changes to their CC Silencing Shot gone for example. Source 

With all incap sharing DR will scatter and trap now DR w/ each other? How will hunters land traps?
Scatter Shot is gone. Traps arm and activate instantly. Source 
"arms and active instantly"? Does that mean it can be fired at a person directly to be trapped? No luncher
No, it has to be placed and has a travel time. Source 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
How will combustion work in relation to the new "dynamic" dots? Popping CDs just to have them be meaningless after
Combustion is based on the damage of the Ignite, so will not dynamically change. Source 

Re pet-cast CC: Freeze going away? If so, room for a non-CC replacement?
Water Elemental Freeze is staying. However, there is a minor talent that teaches Squirt a new spell that shares a cooldown with it Source 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Divine favor is gone right?
Healadins had a whole bunch of cooldowns. Merged some of them together. Source 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
For example, are Combat Rogues going to See AR and Shadow Blades combined?
Killing Spree and Adrenaline Rush for Combat, Vendetta for Assassination, Shadow Dance for Subtlety. Plus talents. Source 

Shadow blades gone? I'd love that.
Yes, Shadow Blades lost the roll of which Rogue cooldown to cut. Source 

Is preparation considered bloat? I think it's good having the choice, I hate abilities with 2 charges it promotes tunelling
We're exploring an idea where Preparation becomes a passive. Details still being worked out. Source 

Removing tricks damage modifier as well, yes please? 
Yes, Tricks of the Trade no longer increases damage. Yay! Source 
Is it going to be free, then?
Oh, yes. Tricks is free. Source 
Awesome, now it's pure utility! It's not as needed anymore with threat buffs it's still an old fav
Indeed. We expect it to be used for helping pick up new adds, that sort of thing. Source 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Regarding pet-cast CC, will Seduction still be in the game as it currently exists?
A nerfed version. We don't like so much CC coming from the pets. Source 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
The blog post implies that Charge is going to be changed to a root after all?
Yes Charge will become a root. Our stance was we liked that change, but 5.4.7 wasn't the right time to do it. Source 
Will Warbringer still add a stun? That will be the only choice for PVP, jumping charges with Freedom/druid shifting/windwalk totem
Yes, Warbringer will be a short stun off DR. Players will be able to get the same behavior with a talent. 
Warbringer stun off of DR seems counter to the idea that all stuns share a DR.
There are a number things with very short duration that do not share DR. Source 
Clarify very short? Heard warbringer will be a 3 second stun. Also presume they DR with themselves? warbringer rotations in RBGs
Basically baseline charge, 1.5 seconds. Source 
Charge should remain as is change the talents instead!
We like the added mobility that the talents give, but charge stun every 12 seconds is too much. Source
