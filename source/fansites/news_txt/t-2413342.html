PvP Disqualification Policy Update<br>
As part of our continued efforts to combat cheating and unfair play in World of Warcraft, we&#x2019;ve recently made a change to our policies regarding PvP disqualifications.<br>
<br>
As of the Battle for Azeroth Pre-Patch, any player who is found to have engaged in unfair practices that result in their disqualification from end-of-season PvP rewards will also have their ability to queue for rated PvP matches immediately revoked. This restriction will continue through the remainder of the season in which they were disqualified, which includes the current &#x201C;Post-Season&#x201D; available until Battle for Azeroth launches.<br>
<br>
This change is intended to minimize the impact that disqualified players have on those who are playing legitimately while the PvP season continues, and is just one aspect of our ongoing commitment to upholding the competitive integrity of World of Warcraft PvP.</div></div>
