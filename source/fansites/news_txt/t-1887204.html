On Inactivity and Freeing Names<br>
In general names are taken in WoW on a &quot;first come, first served&quot; basis. We do realise that having the name of your dreams taken by an inactive character can be a pretty disheartening experience, particularly in cases where you may be moving from one realm to another.<br>
<br>
World of Warcraft has a lot of different types of players, some choose to just focus on a handful of characters and work to getting them to max level and beyond, while others play a large number of characters across multiple realms but may get hardly any to max level. We have to strike a fine balance in this regard as no playstyle is any less &quot;valid.&quot; No matter which period of inactivity we choose to go for, it will always be too long for someone, and too short for someone else. Ultimately we landed on our current policy which you can see at:<br>

<br>
Having said that, there has been a lot of great feedback in this thread which I will be forwarding on. Thanks for taking the time to constructively share your thoughts about this matter!

Overwatch Beta FAQ<br>
Q. How can I opt-in to the Overwatch Closed Beta?<br>
A. To opt into the beta, visit your Beta Profile Settings page in Account Management, check the &quot;Overwatch&quot; box under &quot;Beta Tests I&apos;m Interested In,&quot; and then click &quot;Update Preferences.&quot; Alternatively, you can also sign up by clicking here.<br>
<br>
Please note that opting in will not guarantee you access to the Closed Beta.<br>
<br>
Q. How are Closed Beta participants selected?<br>
A. Beta testers are chosen based on many factors, including your Battle.net region, when you signed up, your computer hardware specifications, and an element of luck. We are also inviting select journalists and community contributors from around the world on a case-by-case basis.<br>
<br>
Q. How will I know if I&apos;m selected to participate in the Closed Beta?<br>
A. If you are selected to participate in the Closed Beta, you will receive an invite via email. Invites will always be sent to the email address associated with your Battle.net account.<br>
<br>
To help avoid phishing attempts, if you believe you&apos;ve received an invite, it&apos;s best to refrain from clicking on any links in the email(s) you receive. Instead, you can verify that your account has been granted a Closed Beta license in Battle.net Account Management.<br>
<br>
Q. Will there be any other ways to get into the Closed Beta besides opting-in?<br>
A. Not at this time. Also, please note that Overwatch beta keys do not exist. Access to the Closed Beta will be provided solely through account flagging.<br>
<br>
Q. How many players do you plan to invite to the Closed Beta?<br>
A. The number of players we invite will be largely based on our testing needs. We also want to make sure the game&#x2019;s matchmaking system remains in a relatively healthy place throughout this phase of testing. As a result, if we determine we need more players to test new features or keep matches running smoothly, we&#x2019;ll continue to add people to the Closed Beta from our opt-in pool.<br>
<br>
Q. What gameplay regions is the Closed Beta available in?<br>
A. The Closed Beta is currently available in the Americas and Europe gameplay regions. We have plans to bring the beta to our Asia gameplay region at a later date. For more information on which countries are associated with each of our gameplay regions, click here.<br>
<br>
Game performance for players in some regions, such as Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America may be sub-optimal during the beta. If you experience issues with gameplay like high latency, excessive loading times, or long matchmaking queues, please be sure to post in our beta forums so that we can work to make improvements.<br>
<br>
Q. What languages are supported in the Closed Beta?<br>
A.The Closed Beta currently supports 10 languages: English, French, German, Castilian Spanish, Polish, Italian, Russian, Latin American Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese. Localization is not yet complete for all languages, however, so some content may still appear in English during the beta.<br>
<br>
Q. If I get invited to the Closed Beta, can I stream or create content about the game?<br>
A. Absolutely! There is no non-disclosure agreement (NDA) for the Closed Beta. You are encouraged to take screenshots, livestream your play sessions, record feedback videos&#x2014;whatever your heart desires. The game is still a work in progress, though, so we appreciate your understanding when you encounter bugs, graphical errors, or other issues.<br>
<br>
Q. Can I run tournaments with a prize pool during the Closed Beta?<br>
A. Yes! You are welcome to run tournaments (with or without prize pools) during the Closed Beta. However, given the size and scope of this phase of beta, we will not be issuing tournament licenses for large-scale events with prize pools over $10k. For smaller events, please review our Community Tournament Guidelines before you begin planning to make sure your community tournament is in compliance.<br>
<br>
If you would like to begin discussing your tournament plans for after game launch, or have any other questions, feel free to reach out to tourneyinfo@blizzard.com any time.<br>
<br>
Q. How long will the Closed Beta last?<br>
A. This phase of the Closed Beta will conclude before the end of the year. We don&apos;t have an exact date to share at this time, but we&apos;ll be sure to provide testers with advanced notice.<br>
<br>
Q. Will any progress I make during the Closed Beta carry over to the live game?<br>
A. No. We&apos;ve no plans at this time for your activity during the Closed Beta to carry over.<br>
<br>
Q. If I don&apos;t get into the Closed Beta, am I guaranteed access to a Beta Test Weekend?<br>
A. No. While Beta Test Weekends will include a much larger number of players than Closed Beta, they will also be invite-only. You&apos;ll need to opt-in to the Overwatch beta to be eligible.<br>
<br>
Q. How do I opt-in to the Beta Test Weekends?<br>
A. There is no special opt-in process for Beta Test Weekends. If you opted-in for the beta, you&apos;re all set!<br>
<br>
As a reminder: To opt into the beta, visit your Beta Profile Settings page in Account Management, check the &quot;Overwatch&quot; box under &quot;Beta Tests I&apos;m Interested In,&quot; and then click &quot;Update Preferences.&quot; Alternatively, you can also sign up by clicking here.<br>
Again, please note that opting in will not guarantee you access to a Beta Test Weekend. <br>
<br>
