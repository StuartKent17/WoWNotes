<br>
(*) - Items with a (*) after their name are available from the vendor on the Sunwell Isle if you can provide the loot above it on the list along with a Sunmote. <br>
<br>
Example - You can get the Helm of Uther&apos;s Resolve (*) (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/helmofuthersresolve.jpg) by trading it to the vendor for Helm of Burning Righteousness (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/helmofburningrighteousness.jpg) and a [item=34664]<br>

<br>
Bosses<br>
Note on Kil&apos;jaeden loot : Nobody killed him yet, however he will most likely be the only one dropping ilvl 164 items. You can already check a few of them at the Sunwell vendor but I&apos;ll only list the 3 that really look like they drop from Kil&apos;jaeden himself (based on their itemID mostly). The three additional items are the one you can get from the vendor with an additional Sunmote, and Apolyon was added because it&apos;s an ilvl 164 weapon and that&apos;s probably the only boss it could drop from. Same goes for Thori&apos;dal, it&apos;s confirmed to be a drop and I don&apos;t really see how it could not drop from the last boss of the dungeon. (Be careful though, the stats of both items are based on the leak posted a few weeks ago)<br>
<br>
Unknown bosses<br>
A lot of weapons stats have been leaked through this Sunwell Loot screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/sunwell_loots.jpg) released before the PTR, so far nothing changed and you probably want to check it for items that aren&apos;t listed below yet. <br>

Dungeon Loot<br>
Legendary bow<br>
The legendary bow is indeed named Thori&apos;dal (and supposedly drops from Kil&apos;jaeden). And since everyone will ask for a proof, here are the spell IDs for some of the bonuses. (The spell names and bonuses are directly from the patch released today)<br>
<br>
44972 : Legendary Bow Haste - Increases ranged attack speed by 15%. Does not stack with quiver or ammo pouch haste effects.<br>
46699 : Requires No Ammo - Thori&apos;dal generates magical arrows when the bow string is drawn. Does not use ammo.<br>

<br>
Sunwell plateau<br>
The old Sunwell Loot screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/sunwell_loots.jpg) is now confirmed. Bonuses on items are considered as spells and are directly added to the patch files, even if none of them dropped yet we can confirm that some of these loots are true and you can probably consider all of them legit now.<br>
<br>
Few examples of spells used in these items<br>
45059 : Vessel of the Naaru - Collects 100 Holy Energy from healing spells you cast. Cannot collect more than ${100*20} Holy Energy.<br>
45064 : Vessel of the Naaru - Release all accumulated Holy Energy to instantly heal current friendly target by the amount of Holy Energy accumulated.<br>
45355 : Item - T7 Melee Trinket Base - Chance on hit to enter a Battle Trance, during which your melee or ranged attacks will each grant 44 attack power, stacking up to 10 times. Expires after 20 seconds.<br>

For instance you can search for items by socket color, by effect (&quot;Critical Strike&quot; for instance) or search gems by their effect (&quot;Strength&quot; for instance). In addition, the searching of items by level has been made more intuitive. You can now search for items by level with &quot;15-20&quot; to search for items that you can make that have a minimum level required of 15 to 20. The Tooltip for player Dodge/Block/Parry in the character sheet has been changed slightly. Optimized particle system rendering for improved frame rates. The casting bar will now display properly when casting Blizzard (mage) or Rain of Fire (warlock) with spell haste. For additional notes on Lua and XML changes please visit the UI &amp; Macros Forum (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?sid=1&amp;forumId=11114).[/list]<br>
