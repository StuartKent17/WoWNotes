World of Warcraft turns seven on November 23, 2011! It&#x2019;s been a truly incredible seven years, and we&#x2019;d like to thank you all for joining us for yet another fantastic year. To celebrate, players who log into the game between November 20 and December 3 will earn a feat of strength added to their Achievements and a &#x201C;Celebration Package&#x201D; item. Using your item will get the celebrations rolling by shooting off fireworks*, applying a (visual only) tabard to your character, and granting a 7% bonus to experience and reputation gains while active.<br>
<br>
We look forward to another year of adventures ahead and many more to come!<br>
<br>
*Please observe all goblin and gnome fire hazard warnings and celebrate responsibly.<br>
