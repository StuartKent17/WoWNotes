Patch 5.2 LFR<br>
It looks like LFR will be broken into four different groupings this time. <br>
<br>
Last Stand of the Zandalari - The forces of the Zandalari forces have dug into the ruins surrounding the Thunder King&apos;s island citadel.<br>
Forgotten Depths - Beneath the foundations of the Throne of Thunder lie vast caverns, teeming with ancient horrors.<br>
Halls of Flesh-Shaping - In the horrific chambers beneath Lei Shen&apos;s citadel, the mogu conducted terrible experiments into reshaping life.<br>
Pinnacle of Storms - From within his inner sanctum, the risen Thunder King plots the return of the great mogu empire.<br>

PvE<br>
Any news on 25men raiding and incentives for them? Numbers of guilds still dwindling, you mentioned a developer blog<br>
We have an idea, but it&apos;s a bit controversial so we&apos;re not ready to spring it on you yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281091815015346177))<br>
<br>
Could you give me a reason as to why 25man raids don&apos;t just straight up drop items that already are already 2/2 upgraded?<br>
Because that would cause progression-oriented 10 player raids to feel like they had to switch to 25s to benefit from the ilevel. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281451667117993984))<br>
<br>
Why the Empress nerf? We were still working on it but felt it was 100% doable.<br>
Ten player raids were bringing 4 healers, which felt broken. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281090558544465920))<br>
<br>
So what about new players 5.3? What about alts? Coming back in the middle of MoP=impossible?<br>
There&apos;s a big continuum between instantly caught up and impossible. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280718882707222529))<br>
<br>
Is 10H Shek&apos;zeer designed to be 4 healed?<br>
Not ideally. Discussing it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280718627311869952))<br>
<br>
Any reason why Flask Cauldrons didn&apos;t make an appearance in MoP ? <br>
We wanted to return some responsibility of raiding to individual members not just officers. <br>
This answer does not make sense. So you should remove feasts too... You are just adding work to the officers.<br>
This is a tiny, tiny step back towards that. It doesn&apos;t seem unreasonable. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280716739875074049))<br>
Once upon a time, players spent a big chunk of time preparing for raiding, not just logging in (+ summoned) and then done. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280716639354368000))<br>
<br>
How &quot;bad&quot; would it for the game if LFR never dropped twice the same item (DW aside) ? Did you do that projection internally ?<br>
If players could gear up that much faster, then they&apos;d finish the content (and demand something new) that much faster... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280485818387271681))<br>
<br>
LFR is the only way for me as a casual to get loot. After the 4th run with nodrops, i got so angry.. i destroyed my mouse<br>
You&apos;ll still get valor from those runs though and that gear is higher ilevel. I&apos;ve raided for weeks many times with no drops. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281452702926516224))<br>
<br>
Expanding on recent LFR thread, could there be two options at queuing for loot? &apos;Queued spec&apos; or &apos;any spec&apos; would make sense.<br>
Yeah it needs something like that, but it needs to be clean, not a double role check. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280386797727518720))<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, most of what LFR healing consists of is meter padding.<br>
I wouldn&apos;t take LFR meters as a meaningful indication of anything. That&apos;s just not what LFR is about. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280386128555679744))<br>
<br>
A player is fighting vs Galleon. He changes to another group. The second group can loot. Is it ok for you?<br>
I know there were some mixed messages from us on this, but it&apos;s fine. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281526153007751168))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Every gladiator/2400+ player I know feels that you balance poorly. Nerf &quot;a&quot; classleave starsurge at 250k = golden<br>
We have heard very little Starsurge QQ, even from highly rated players. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281455289675427840))<br>
<br>
Do healers in pvp have roles between classes, or should they be similar to each other?<br>
They should feel different, but generally you don&apos;t need enough of them for well-defined niches to be important. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281457601881985025))<br>
<br>
So, warriors back to the free-kills in PVP again.Surprise.Plz don&apos;t kill PVE viability when you do.<br>
Despite what forums would have you believe, there is a continuum between overpowered and free kill. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281525075495227393))<br>
<br>
How do you feel about the players getting to 90 just now and not being able to play arena competitively due to being behind<br>
We want to reward players who keep playing. Too often in the past catch up was so easy that it trivialized accomplishments. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280482725448777728))<br>
So, since Mt. Everest was climbed the first time, have we put up gates to stop people from going up there?<br>
We don&apos;t put chair lifts up there... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280723177666117632))<br>
Also, they havent pu lifts because of technical limitations, not because of climbers having their achieve screwed<br>
I&apos;d argue mountain climbers like to climb things that are challenging, not things that anyone can stroll up. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280725302739599362))<br>
But you brought this trivialization of content yourselves starting with patch 3.2 &gt;.&gt; &#x2026; what have you learned since then?<br>
We learned not to let players catch up so trivially that it negates everyone else&apos;s accomplishments. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280721645272981505))<br>
Greg, you need to stop blaming the wrong things for cataclysm failures. Catch up mechanics dont hurt the game<br>
We just disagree on that. I understand you have very strong feelings about how things should work. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280725857054621696))<br>
<br>
why make us to do Rated BGs for cap?<br>
We know from history that players will do the most convenient thing to earn points without a strong incentive to do otherwise. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280724307129290753))<br>
<br>
In your opinion, whats a more fun pvp experience? A team objective based bg? or chasing a druid around a piller for 30+ mins?<br>
I personally prefer the former, but as I&apos;ve said, I know not all our players like what I like. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280485611473874945))<br>
<br>
Upgrading PVP gear via Conq sure is rough for newcomers to arenas who want to catch up. It was already so hard to compete =\<br>
If newcomers can catch up too quickly, then the players who stuck with it start to wonder why they bothered. It&apos;s a fine line. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280715673729130496))<br>
Getting gear is 0% of PvP. In fact we hate that part. It&apos;s the competition. Please realize that.<br>
For tournaments, gear shouldn&apos;t matter. For playing your character, we want it to. It&apos;s a powerful incentive. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281096112805404673))<br>
WoW is an RPG. Getting gear is a big part of that. We don&apos;t think the game would have legs, even in PvP, without it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281096003317276672))<br>
<br>
heres one more, how about balance pvp around BG and RBG instead of 3v3 arena. BGs are were 90% of pvp takes place if not more<br>
I don&apos;t think that % is correct. Arenas, even very casual 2s, are very popular. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280040057564438528))<br>
yes that maybe true, but you balance pvp around 3v3, where the most pvp is not played<br>
PvP might not be played by you in 3&apos;s but it is the most competitive and balanced bracket even rbgs are a mess<br>
RBGs feel pretty good to us. What are your concerns? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280484663791874049))<br>
<br>
My point, is that Tanks have a purpose in arena, pvp has become who can lock down who first. Its not methodical.<br>
We&apos;re just not convinced that tanks in Arena would be very fun for everyone else. Tanks make great flag carriers in BGs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280483357916286976))<br>
