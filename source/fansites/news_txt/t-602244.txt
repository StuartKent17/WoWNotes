Two new screenshots of Wrath of the Lich King were added to the official site, I'm not sure what zone this is, this could just be some random forest crystalsong ?, or maybe a small preview of the emerald dream. but unlikely

WotLK Armor sets
They're still thinking about re-using tier 3 models in the new naxxramas but I still couldn't find a blue post where someone dare confirming it, they're also planning to re-use other tiers =more recoloring
Yes, some of the earlier armor models in The Burning Crusade were modified versions of tier 1 and 2 armor, but tiers 4, 5, and 6 are all brand new armor models and stand out as a strong accomplishment for the players who have them.

We have previously stated that we may re-use the tier 3 art models for the new version of Naxxramas. This was mainly because the armor models really fit the dungeon they were coming from and look really awesome.

Will we modify other tiers of armor and use them in Wrath of the Lich King? It's possible, but I am also confident that new armor sets will be made ... and I will be drooling over them as usual. &#58;

One expansion each year
Surprisingly, Blizzard is still planning to release one expansion each year. Of course, we still don't know if it means 365 days after Burning Crusade, or BC in 2007 and WotLK in 2008. 
This is something we talked about awhile ago and it is still a goal for us. Keep in mind that a goal isn't a guarantee. We are always trying to add as many dungeons, items, and features as possible and this of course takes time. So when will we release Wrath of the Lich King? When it's ready. &#58;

BC Price drop
There isn't anything said about the price of BC alone, but the Battlechest including the two Bradygames http://www.bradygames.com/ guides a preview of the last one is available here http://www.bradygames.com/content/images/9780744009125/samplechapter/wowdc2sample.pdf is their new offer for new players or if you want to buy another account to powerlevel all your alts by rushing the brand new +30% xp quests and lowered xp requirements in 2.3/2.4.
Sooner than you think actually. We announced on our front page that we are making a World of Warcraft Battlechest in August. Here is a rundown on what it will include:

In early October, we'll be releasing the World of Warcraft Battle Chest, which combines the DVD versions of World of Warcraft and the game’s first expansion, The Burning Crusade, with the BradyGames strategy guides for both titles all in one package. At a suggested retail price of $39.99, this will be a great value for anyone looking to begin their World of Warcraft experience -- and a great gift for anyone you’d like to share that experience with. The World of Warcraft Battle Chest will beginning shipping on October 2 and should be available in stores nationwide shortly thereafter.

Daily quests
Daily quests are a success and they plan to keep adding them in WotLK.
We do have plans to increase the number of daily quests in the game.
