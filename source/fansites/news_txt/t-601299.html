<br>
Blizzard has been heavily testing an encounter lately, and nearly all the loots seems to be &quot;available&quot;. They arent from Illidan (ilvl 141, it should be 151) so ... basically it means we&apos;ve got the Essence of Souls loot table, or the Illidari Council loot table, hurray for us ? The uber loot compilation should be available shortly since someone requested it in comments. <br>
