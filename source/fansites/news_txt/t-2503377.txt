Siege of Boralus 

Corrected an issue in the Dread Captain Lockwood encounter where a player dying while holding the cannon would not spawn a new cannon.

Developers’ notes: Arms Warrior, Destruction Warlock, Frost Death Knight, and Unholy Death Knight are generally underperforming and could use a damage increase.

Conflict and Strife's Essence Rank 4 visual should now properly display when PvP events are triggered such as capturing a flag or interrupting a target.



Mounts

Vicious Basilisks have grown larger for most races, and even larger for large races.
