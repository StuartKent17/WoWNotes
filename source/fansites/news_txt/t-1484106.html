Ok, core if issue inc. Value of crit PvP != Value of crit PvE. Value of other stats PvP = Val other stat PvE. Given that, how can you possible make balanced with other values in PVE and PvP at the same time? If you can&apos;t, crit classes will be weak in PvP. If you buff them, they&apos;ll be strong in PvE.<br>
It&apos;s worth remembering that at 200%, crit is *more* valuable in PvP, than PvE. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443439880199077889))<br>
Will elemental shamans still get their buffed crit modifier in PvP?<br>
It&apos;s a 25% reduction to crit damage. So they still get extra crit damage, but then reduced by 25%. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443464655910883328))<br>
So (200% base +50% extra) -25% = 187.5% crit for ele shamans in PvP?<br>
Yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443466381971816448))<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br>
&apos;Afternoon. WoD Tank info seems hard to come by. 3 ?s, if you are willing: Value of Multistrike for tanks(just dps or more)?<br>
Multistrike will have defensive value. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444179013720748032))<br>
Is that just self-heals, or a chance for damage reduction to multistrike? I.e., get another 30% of your armor?<br>
Just like there are passives that give defensive value to crit, there will be passives that give defensive value to Multistrike. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444204525503520768))<br>
<br>
.Meaning 30% Multistrike = one 30% roll in PvP (max 130% damage), two 15% rolls in PvE (max 160% damage), same avg dmg?<br>
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443564629050920960))<br>
<br>
Also, the same argument can be made for haste because haste bonus to CC casts. Separate value there too? <br>
Multistrike will also have a PvP modifier. One extra roll instead of two. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443445206738665472))<br>
Everyone will just avoid crit and multistrike like the plague, don&apos;t see how it&apos;s a good idea<br>
Multistrike&apos;s combines the two rolls into one. Same average chance. Multistrike will definitely *not* be avoided. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443471882973495296))<br>
are you sure that multistrike isn&apos;t causing a similar problem that you just fixed with 150% crits? Peaky dmg.<br>
Multistrike caps out at 130%, and is much *much* more common, such that it will be the common occurrence, not a rare burst. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443692554106568704))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Pugging is a prob. a niche audience too though, saying that just because personal is an option, organizers might not take it<br>
I&apos;d expect PUG organizers using personal loot will see more takers. It&apos;s nice to not worry whether you can trust the master loot (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440628348796952576))<br>
<br>
any plans for an increase of tank dmg taken to make room for dedicated tank healers again?<br>
If we hit tanks any harder today, we&apos;d just one-shot them. Vengeance and smart heals are the major culprits. Agree with the goal. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440595499494547456))<br>
Just tank healing or Single-Target healing in general? I think targeted healing is more interesting than aoe/smart<br>
Absolutely. Making decisions is more interesting than pushing a button and having them made for you. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440632932827275265))<br>
<br>
how are heroic lockouts handled? had a shammy, not able to join H.Galakras because he was locked to 3/4 /w H.Norushen down.<br>
Heroic lockouts assign a single fixed raid ID for the week, and you can&apos;t enter any other Heroic ID for that zone once locked. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440671787609636865))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
If silences are gone from interrupt, what happens to silencing shot? Gone too?<br>
Replaced with Counter Shot (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443596569657356289))<br>
<br>
Is there a reason a lot of classes dodge/parry monks in arenas? 6% over pvp expertise cap, and I don&apos;t get issue on other toons <br>
Agility classes gain dodge &amp; strength classes gain parry. Attack them from behind to avoid getting dodged/parried. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443811706934792192))<br>
<br>
Will Movement speed stack in RBG disapear totally anytime soo ? <br>
We&apos;re reimplementing this speed system in Warlords to avoid alot of these stacking bugs slipping through. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443801591510863873))<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor<br>
There isn&apos;t a word in the English language that would adequately convey how much I want new Garrison info. ETA on info dump?<br>
Soon&#x2122; (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/443268875916808192))<br>
and beta? <br>
Probably less soon? Gotta make sure it&apos;s #Savage enough (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/443293680892268544))<br>
