Mists of Pandaria Cooking Preview
The recent beta builds have updated and added several cooking quests, most of which take place in the Halfhill Market in the Valley of the Four Winds. The Nomi line takes advantage of the new Friendship system that is similar to reputation. In order to begin questing with Nomi, you must first complete the To Be a Master  quest and earn Ironpaw Token  x 100 to purchase Cooking School Bell  The quest requires you to have 600 cooking in every specialization. 

The Replenishing the Pantry  quest allows you to turn in a Bundle of Groceries  every day in exchange for an Ironpaw Token , which is the new Chef's Award in Mists of Pandaria. It will be used to purchase cooking ingredients from Nam Ironpaw, as well as a few novelty items  which cost Ironpaw Token  x 50. 

Each cooking specialization has an individual level which determines which recipes you can learn for that specialization. Your highest level specialization will be your cooking level, which will allow you to learn any non specialization recipe that requires a certain cooking level. You can see the recipes that have been added so far on WoWDB

Why do we Identify Rare Items?
Let’s start off small: Scrolls of Identification are no longer in the game. Unidentified items and the act of identifying them is still very much part of the game, but now when obtaining an unidentified item you'll simply right click it, a short cast timer will occur as your character examines the item, and it will become identified. We love the double-discovery of finding a present and then unwrapping it, but we don't think it requires a physical item you have to find and keep in your bags to get the same effect. From now on you'll just be able to inherently identify all your items, no need to carry scrolls. Your character in Diablo III is just that badass now. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Legendary Item Quality
Who doesn't want Legendary items to be the best items in the game?
Players shouldn't, really. I mean if you want all end-game characters to look the same and have on the exact same items by having a single #1 best item in the game, it's a good way to get there. It's a lot easier, to be sure, to just chase a single BiS item, but we really don't believe it should be a lot easier. It should be difficult to find and judge and compare and build characters out of a mix of randomized items, not just go after a tier set. 

Hah. Well, no one is standing back, every designer is in the thick of it working on future updates, patches, hotfixes, etc. I think it really comes down to a perception issue that color quality differentiation and name have made. If the items were called Uniques, as they were in Diablo II, would you assume they were the best items in the game? Maybe, if they're the hardest to find. But I think the point is that the hardest to find items are not in fact Legendaries, but perfect Rare items. It's less intuitive to not have clear separations of item power through name and color, and that's tripping people up to be sure.

But that's not the issue here, the issue here is the legendaries are worse than rares and blues. And that should not be. Please accept that THIS is what players want. For once in my life I am VERY comfortable speaking for everyone. We're accustomed to the term "Legendary" actually MEANING something.
And we've stated we plan to buff them and add more unique affixes.

I don't know ... we're looking to buff them. Whether we guarantee a blue item dropping in the same difficulty/Act can't have higher DPS than a Legendary is still a judgment call we've yet to make. It'd sure make more sense to people who are stuck on item colors telling them which should be better, but whether it's the best for game's itemization I think is still up in the air. Giving players a clear 'best item' is not necessarily the best decision for the game and itemization landscape.

Auction House and Item Drop Rates
I have ZERO chance to find a legendary, because the server has now adjusted the rates on the fly, because others have already found it.
That's not what was said or implied at all, sorry if it was confusing. The AH doesn't have any affect on the literal drop rates of items depending on what's available.

What I said, and what is true, is that with far more players and an increased proliferation of item trade, we have to factor in how many items are being found by players and how quickly a player can gear up by 'sourcing' items from others through trade and the convenience of the gold auction house.

If we say "a player should have X power in Y amount of time through drops" and completely ignore that the time factor can be reduced by simply having access to more drops through trading and the auction house, players would be gearing up far quicker than we've determined they should. It has nothing to do with the auction house per se, but the general ease at which players have access to more items than they would without it and us needing to keep that in mind while balancing drops. It would be rather poorly thought out if we balanced drops completely ignoring all of the ways players can gear up, and trading is certainly one of them.

Obviously everyone wants the best gear possible as quickly as possible, and us attempting to mediate that through design that takes all factors into account is not always going to be a popular notion. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
