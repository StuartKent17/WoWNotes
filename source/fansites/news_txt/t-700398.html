<br>
Is Patch 3.3.3 going live this week?<br>
Not a chance. The last 2 ptr builds were fairly unstable and Blizzard would never risk pushing it live this week, especially with some of the developers and lead developers attending the GDC (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Developers_Conference) in San Francisco this week.<br>

Healing and Mana Efficiency in Cataclysm<br>
If you use your efficient heal 100% of the time, then sometimes people will die for want of a quick or big heal. If you use your quick or big heal 100% of the time, then sometimes you will run out of mana. If you use the right heal for the job, you will be awesome and get fat purps. <br>
<br>
[...] We want the choice that downranking provided (don&apos;t use a big heal when a small one will do) without all the problems of gaming the coefficients of the lower level spells.<br>
<br>
[...] Prior to LK, healers wouldn&apos;t use their quick / big heal every GCD. They would even stop heals to avoid wasting mana. We&apos;re not really trying to bring back cancel macros in a big way, but we would like for the best healers to be the ones who know when to use the right spell at the right time.

Tanking Threat<br>
I would be very curious to see those numbers. You&apos;re making a jump from &quot;Sometimes AE pull off of me&quot; to &quot;AE will always pull off of me,&quot; and that&apos;s just not what we&apos;re seeing. I totally buy that a warrior may work harder to generate as much, or less, AE threat as a paladin. We&apos;ve acknowledged that is a problem. But that is the comparison I would make, not the comparison between &quot;Sometimes I have to do stuff to maintain threat&quot; and &quot;Under no circumstances should I ever have threat problems.&quot;<br>
<br>
It isn&apos;t the goal that dps can never pull off of you under any situation. If that was the goal, we&apos;re wasting an awful lot of the game space on all of these +threat and -threat talents and abilities, when we could just institute a rule that mobs will never retarget off of their initial target (which would hopefully be the tank). I don&apos;t think that would make tanking more fun, though it would definitely make it easier.<br>
<br>
The threat-related goals still remain:<br>
<br>
1) All -- Get threat to scale better at higher dps levels.<br>
2) Paladin -- Nerf the threat capacity of HoR and SoC.<br>
3) Druid -- Something to do on AE packs besides Swipe.<br>
4) DK -- More burst threat, which the Icy Touch change should accomplish.<br>
5) Warrior -- As I&apos;ve said, we&apos;re pretty happy with, minus points 1 and 2 above.<br>
6) I&apos;ll add that if taunts retain the ability to miss at all, it should be something you can gear your way out of. It&apos;s also possible we&apos;ll just make them always hit. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23425588028-do-warriors-really-need-another-cleave.html))<br>
