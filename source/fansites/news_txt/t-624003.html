2.8 million copies in 24 hours ... no wonder why my Saronite is selling so fast at the auction house. <br>
IRVINE, Calif. - November 20, 2008 - Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. today announced that World of Warcraft&#xAE;&apos;s second expansion, Wrath of the Lich King&#x2122;, has sold more than 2.8 million copies in its first 24 hours of availability*, making it the fastest-selling PC game of all time. This eclipses the previous record of nearly 2.4 million copies sold in 24 hours, set in January 2007 by Blizzard&apos;s first World of Warcraft expansion, The Burning Crusade&#xAE;. Wrath of the Lich King was simultaneously released in North America, Europe, Chile, Argentina, and Russia on November 13; Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand on November 14; and South Korea and the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau on November 18.<br>

In celebration of the launch, more than 15,000 stores throughout the world had their doors open at midnight to welcome thousands of expectant players. Several of these locations were attended by Blizzard Entertainment representatives, who met players and signed copies of the game.<br>
<br>
&quot;We&apos;re grateful for the incredible support that players around the world have continued to show for World of Warcraft,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. &#x201C;Wrath of the Lich King contains some of the best content we&#x2019;ve created for the game so far, and we look forward to seeing even more players log in to experience it in the days ahead.&quot;<br>

&quot;After a single day of availability, Wrath of the Lich King is already the bestselling PC game of 2008 at GameStop and ranks as one of our top-selling products so far this year,&quot; said Bob McKenzie, GameStop&#x2019;s senior vice president of merchandising. &quot;In keeping with the tradition established by their previous releases, Blizzard Entertainment has again created a product that not only reflects their high standards of quality but is clearly an instant hit with gamers around the country.&quot;<br>
