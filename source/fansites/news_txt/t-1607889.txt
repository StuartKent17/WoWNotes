chaud2014-10-13, 03:27 AMPatch 6.0.2 Live This Week
The Warlords of Draenor systems patch will be going live this week and it brings a lot of changes! Make sure your Background Downloader has downloaded the files so you aren't stuck waiting on patch day.

This patch will convert your install to using the new CASC format, which can be a time consuming process. Be sure to defrag before and after the install if you are not using a SSD. The free version of Defraggler  is a useful tool, as it can defrag just the WoW files if you are in a hurry.

New Character Modelsnewcharactermodels
After asking for updated character models for years, they are finally here! Except for Blood Elves, which are coming in a later patch

Stat Changesstatchanges

The stat squish is finally here. Numbers will be much smaller, but combat should feel the same. Yes, you can still solo old raids.

New secondary stats have been added and are on a few items: 

Bonus Armor  - Increases Armor and Attack Power for tanking specializations. 
Multistrike  - Grants a chance for spells and abilities to fire up to 2 additional times, at 30% effectiveness both damage and healing. 
Versatility  - Increases damage, healing, and absorption done. Reduces damage taken. 




AskMrRobot Updating
AskMrRobot should be fully updated and ready to go on Tuesday with a new UI  Reforging may be gone, but gear optimization is still a part of the game. 

As an added bonus, the Best in Bags feature  will be free this week, which should help you figure out which gear that you have is the best after reforges are undone. 

Unfortunately it appears that the API team was not as prepared, as they are predicting  API troubles with the new patch until Warlords release. If there are API issues, you can import your character with the AMR Addon  as a manual import 


  


Merged Auction Houseahchanges
Players on the less populated faction will no longer have as much trouble finding things on the auction house, as Patch 6.0.2 merges the Alliance, Horde, and Neutral auction houses into one for each realm.


  


Black Market Auction House
The Black Market Auction House has relocated to Draenor and the Pandaria location has been retired.


  


Currency ChangescurrencyChanges

Item upgrades now cost 50 x Lesser Charm of Good Fortune  each.

The toy box is on the collections tab, next to the mounts and pets tab.
Items in the toy box are available account wide.
Only one copy of an item can be added to your toy box, so all of the others will have to be deleted.
You can set toys as your favorite so that they appear at the start of the list.
Toys that you haven't collected yet will list a source.
You can filter toys by source and name.
Some toys that can no longer be obtained aren't listed under Not Collected, but if you have them you can add them to the toy box.

Talent Changes
While you won't have access to Level 100 talents, all of the other changes are going live with the patch.


Exclusive glyphs cannot be used with each other. These are usually glyphs that both modify the same spell, such as Glyph of Ice Block  and Glyph of Regenerative Ice 
Some glyphs are learned automatically as you level, such as Glyph of Siphon Life  These are earned at level 25, 50, 60, and 75.

Guild Changesguildchanges
Guild levels have been removed  for Warlords of Draenor, along with some of the perks that they provided. This includes the Cash Flow perk, which was causing players to form guilds and spam invite others to take advantage of the perk.

Every guild now offers the same perks. Many of the perks that were removed are just applied to everyone now, even if they aren't in a guild. A list of the remaining perks is below.

Group Findergroupfinder
This patch also removes the old Raid Browser that got a temporary fix for Patch 5.4 and replaces it with a real Group Finder 


Creating a group first requires you to pick a category: Questing, Dungeons, Scenarios, Raids MoP, Raids Legacy, Arena Skirmishes, Battlegrounds, or Custom.

Questing: Allows you to select the continent and zone
Dungeons: Allows you to select random or a specific dungeon, as well as the difficulty.
Scenarios: Allows you to select the scenario and difficulty.
Raids - Allows you to select the raid and difficulty.
Skirmishes - Allows you to select the size 2v2 or 3v3

After selecting the activity, you can add a title, description, minimum item level your own or lower only, and voice chat.
When browsing groups, you can see the number of players of each role in the group. 
When applying to a group, you can include a note to the leader.
When in a group, you can see a list of everyone's role and item level.
When someone applies to your group, you can see their Proving Grounds achievements.



      

 


Siege of Orgrimmar Changessoochanges
Siege of Orgrimmar is giving out Heirloom weapons and has been converted to the new Warlords of Draenor raid size system.


Your first heirloom weapon  drop per difficulty  is now guaranteed. These weapons will scale up while leveling and won't be replaced until at least level 100, so be sure to grab some for yourself and alts!
The Warlords of Draenor raid size system will be applied to Siege of Orgrimmar:

There are now four difficulties: Raid Finder, Normal was Flex, Heroic was Normal, and Mythic was Heroic.
Normal and Heroic will scale from 10 to 30 players. Raid Finder can also scale down if players drop group.
Mythic will be a fixed size of 20 players.
Each difficulty has its own weekly lockout. 
Raid Finder, Normal, and Heroic have a loot based lockout, which means you can kill bosses as many times as you would like, but you will only get loot in each difficulty once a week. The amount of loot that drops scales to the number of people eligible for loot, so you can't game the system.
Mythic difficulty has an ID based lockout, similar to how Heroic lockouts have worked previously. You are locked to one raid ID for the week.

The Ahead of the Curve  10  and 25  achievements for killing Normal Garrosh are no longer be obtainable. These rewarded the Kor'kron War Wolf  mount.
The Cutting Edge  10  and 25  achievements for killing Heroic Garrosh are also no longer obtainable. These achievement had no reward.
The Kor'kron Juggernaut  mount that drops from Heroic Garrosh isn't going away, but after Warlords is live it will be a rare drop instead of guaranteed. 
You can queue for Dragon Soul LFR once again, but there is no matchmaking. You must form your own group and travel to Auridormi  in the Caverns of Time to queue.


OpenRaid Updated
If you want to schedule a Siege of Orgrimmar run to get your Garrosh heirlooms, OpenRaid is ready with many groups already listed for Tuesday.


  


Level 90 Upper Blackrock Spireubrs
There is a special Level 90 version of the revamped Upper Blackrock Spire available for players during Patch 6.0.2. The loot is item level 550, which is better than Flex Siege of Orgrimmar gear that hasn't been upgraded yet. There will be an item level restriction  in place, but the dungeon is tuned for players with a few pieces of Raid Finder Siege of Orgrimmar gear, so it shouldn't be too high.

Blasted Lands Questsblastedlands
The Iron Horde have come through the red Dark Portal and taken over most of the Blasted Lands. Thrall , Khadgar , Vindicator Maraad , and other NPCs have set up small camps near the Dark Portal with a short quest line of standard kill, collect, and interact objectives.

At the end of the quest line, Thrall will assist you in killing the leader of this Iron Horde assault. Turning in the final quest played the incorrect cinematic when we did this preview. You can see the correct cinematic here  Quests were also very slightly tweaked since this preview, but nothing significant was changed.

This quest line rewards the Iron Starlette  pet, the The Iron Invasion  achievement, and the <Name> of the Iron Vanguard  title.

Updated Character Selection Screenscharselect
A few of the races got new character selection screens.


          


Arena Skirmishesskirmishes
Players have been asking for skirmishes back for a long time and they finally make their return in Patch 6.0.2!


Skirmishes have no visible ratings, unlike regular arenas. There is a hidden rating used for loose matchmaking to keep things a little more balanced.
Skirmishes are only offered in 2v2 and 3v3 sizes.
You can queue for a skirmish solo or with a group.
Skirmishes will reward honor 
If you run across someone you enjoyed playing with, you can queue again with them at the end of a match.



  


UI Improvementsuiupgrades
The default UI has received several upgrades:


The Dungeon Journal now includes short overviews of the fight for each role, which should help players that don't know the fights. 
The Key Binding UI has also been improved to a tabbed list rather than a very long list you have to scroll through. 
You are now able to manage addons in game without having to log out. 
Bags have several improvements:

The default UI now allows you to assign item types to certain bags, search your bags, and auto sort your bags. 
Junk items in your bags display a gold coin icon when you are at a vendor, letting you know it is safe to vendor them.
Items in your bag have a item quality colored border around the icon.

The Mount Journal has several improvements:

The journal now lists a source and description for mounts.
You are now able to set mounts as favorites, putting them at the top of the list.
There is a new Summon Random Favorite Mount button, which selects a usable mount at random from your favorites.
Mounts that are faction specific now have a different background in the list.

The map and quest log have several improvements:

The quest log has been integrated into the map.
The map now becomes transparent when you are moving.
The map is now zoomable and draggable.
If you prefer a fullscreen map still, you can make it fullscreen. M will then open the map and L will open the quest log and map combination.

You can now scroll through your spellbook with the mouse wheel.
Quest objectives, NPCs, your target, and mouseover all can have outlines now. These replace the old sparkles used to show quest objectives. 
The default action bars can now show cooldown duration in numbers.
There is a now screen that gives you a list of a few of the big new things in a patch.
The client now tones down or hides some less important spells when things are visually cluttered. This should increase performance in group content and make it easier to see what is going on. 
Graphics settings  can be changed automatically to your presets in raids and battlegrounds.

Undelete Character Featureundeletechar
In the upcoming pre-Warlords of Draenor content patch, we’re adding a new feature that allows players to undelete characters. But before you delete that character, there are a few limitations we want you to let you to know about first.


Characters under level 10 and Death Knights at level 55 are not eligible to be undeleted.
Characters between level 10 and level 29 will no longer recoverable after 90 days.
Characters between level 30 and 49 will no longer recoverable after 120 days.
All other characters level 50 and above are eligible to be undeleted at any time.
Please keep in mind you will only be able to use the undelete option once every 30 days.



  

Reclaiming Your Name: What About Flugur?
We’ll be holding deleted character names for a limited time, and the original creator can reclaim it for use on a new character during that time. If you create a new character with the same name as one of your deleted characters let’s say Flugur, the new character must be renamed, transferred, or deleted to complete the restoration of the original Flugur.


Server Responsiveness Improvementsresponsiveness
I don't want to get too deep into the under-the-hood workings of WoW servers, but here's a super short version. Any action that one unit takes on another different unit used to be processed in batches every 400ms. Some very attentive people may have noticed that healing yourself would give you the health instantly minus client/server latency, whereas healing another unit would incur a delay of between 0ms and 400ms again, on top of client/server latency. Same with damaging, applying auras, interrupting, knocking back, etc.

That delay can feel bad just due to the somewhat laggy responsiveness feeling, but also because the state of things can change during that time. For example: Holly the Holy Priest is healing Punky the Brewmaster. Punky spikes low, and Holly hits Guardian Spirit in a panic. The server verifies that Holly is able to cast it, and that Punky is alive great!. The cast goes off, Guardian Spirit goes on cooldown, and a request is placed for the Guardian Spirit aura that prevents dying to be placed on Punky. That request will be filled next time the 400ms timer loops, which happens to be 320ms from now. 250ms later, the boss lands another hit on on Punky. Punky dies. Sadface. Another 70ms goes by, and the Guardian Spirit aura request pops up, and goes "Hey guys, I'm here!... Aww... damn, I missed the party. Sadface."

We no longer batch them up like that. We just do it as fast as we can, which usually amounts to between 1ms and 10ms later. It took a considerable amount of work to get it working that way, but we're very pleased with the results so far; the game feels noticeably more responsive.

I can't guarantee that you'll never ever again run into cases where Guardian Spirit went on cooldown and the tank still died... but it'll be literally 40x rarer than before, and the whole game will feel more responsive too.


Anti-Aliasingaachanges
The old MSAA  option is now gone. In its place is FXAA  and CMAA  options. These offer reduced jaggniess at less of a performance cost than MSAA, but tend to result in somewhat blurrier images. You can find more details in the related tech blog 


    


Challenge Modes
All of the challenge mode achievements are Legacy and Feat of Strength achievements, with all of the rewards other than the armor sets and teleport spells becoming account wide. 


Bronze  - The Undaunted  title is unobtainable and account-wide.
Silver  - The mounts are unobtainable and account-wide. If you have at least one of the mounts, all four  all of the mounts should be unlocked. 

Modelviewer: <div class="mv-ph" data-model-id="44633" data-model-type="creatures">Crimson <div class="mv-overlay"></div> </div>, <div class="mv-ph" data-model-id="45521" data-model-type="creatures">Ashen <div class="mv-overlay"></div> </div>, <div class="mv-ph" data-model-id="45520" data-model-type="creatures">Emerald <div class="mv-overlay"></div> </div>, <div class="mv-ph" data-model-id="45522" data-model-type="creatures">Violet <div class="mv-overlay"></div> </div>

Gold  - The transmog armor sets and teleport spells are unobtainable and remained character specific. The Gold guild achievement  that rewards a pet is unobtainable.
