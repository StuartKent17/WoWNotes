Legion - Resto Shaman Artifact Effect
Resto Shaman also get an effect  from their Artifact weapon in Legion, though it isn't as exciting as the Fire mage effect  After you have been idle for several minutes, your character assumes the pose shown below and a blue swirl appears underneath you. 


  


Legion - Character Trial Boost
The latest Legion build added some interesting strings that point to players being able to boost a character to level 100 to try it for a limited duration. Unfortunately the process isn't enabled on the Legion Alpha right now, so we don't have more details.

Fury of the Eagle is consuming all my stacks of Mongoose Bite when I use it, it's a bug or intended?
This is a bug - Fury of the Eagle should not be consuming your stacks of Mongoose Bite. Thanks for the heads up! WarcraftDevs 

Weird/stupid question: What's the bulk of quest design? What skills are needed?
it's about 50% spawning creature placement/actions/flavor, 40% mechanics building spells and gameplay and maybe 10% writing. DaveKosak 


Computers - Setup of the Month
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices  are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. New GPUs may be coming later this year.

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 6700K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions!
