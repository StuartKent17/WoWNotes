Boubouille2011-08-28, 04:47 PMPatch 4.2.2 on Live Realms probably this Week
The final version of Patch 4.2.2 Build 14645 hit the Blizzard download servers and it means the patch will most likely go live this week. Last week's build was flagged as release but wasn't deployed to be ready as a live patch, but this build seems to be the right one unless something terrible happens, as usual, but it never does. 

This patch doesn't really have anything interesting for players, it's mostly a bug fixes patch with a way to consolidate most of the Patch 4.2 hotfixes into the game files to display them properly.

When's the Diablo 3 Beta?
People keep asking when the D3 beta is, and it's pretty hard to give an actual date. Fansites have been contacted and asked to give contact info battle.net accounts for an access to the beta. 

The beta is definitely approaching and we probably won't have to wait much longer before we see something happen! As usual, keep an eye on Diablofans.com  for any D3 related update. 
We have begun early media and fansite outreach in preparation for the upcoming Diablo III beta test. The email they are receiving clearly states that we do not have a date to announce for the start of the beta test.

While we appreciate the interest in the beta test, we’d like to take this opportunity to caution everyone of potential phishing attempts or scams. Emails from Blizzard Entertainment will NEVER ask you for your password, and if you are selected for participation in the beta test, you won’t need to click any links in any corresponding email that you’d receive from us. When the time comes, players accepted into the beta test will be able to sign in to their account at www.Battle.net and see a Diablo III Beta license as one of their game licenses, as well as the ability to download the beta.

In order to be eligible to participate in the Diablo III beta test, you should set up a Beta Profile on your Battle.net account, by following these instructions: 

You'll want to stay tuned to the front page blogs of this community site for future announcements regarding the Diablo III beta test.
