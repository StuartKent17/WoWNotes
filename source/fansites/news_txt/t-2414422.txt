War of Thorns Quest Chain
Spoilers ahead! The War of Thorns  quest chain that leads up to the Burning of Teldrassil starts today!


There is a time gate this week on the quest chain that ends at the halfway point.
This quest chain involves the Horde marching on Teldrassil through Darkshore while what little Darnassian troops are available try to hold them back. It eventually culminates in the burning of the tree.
Both factions unlock the world quests in Darkshore after completing the quest chain up to the halfway point where there is a stalemate at Wildbend River. These world quests provide catch up gear, order hall resources, and gold.
Alliance players are rewarded with the Smoldering Reins of the Teldrassil Hippogryph  while the Horde receives the War-Torn Reins of the Undercity Plaguebat  for completing the entire quest chain.

Jump into PvP Brawls: Deep Six
Who has your six in this six vs. six brawl? Deep Six will put you and your group to the test.

Every other week, a new PvP Brawl will be available to players looking for something just a little different. Each Brawl will offer a variety of modes, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay, and you’ll find them in the Group Finder tool hotkey “I” in the Player vs. Player tab. Just like Random Battlegrounds, you’ll receive a reward for achieving victory.

Deep Six pits teams of six players against each other in three iconic Battlegrounds: Warsong Gulch, Silvershard Mines, and Temple of Kotmogu. Each Battleground offers a little variation on the traditional format, such as flags that are a bit closer in Warsong Gulch, less carts to keep track of in Silvershard Mines, and only two orbs within the Temple of Kotmogu.
