Mastery System and PvP Balance<br>
First, it&apos;s a powerful new tool, but it&apos;s by no means the only tool in the toolbox.<br>
<br>
Second, higher health pools and survivability relative to damage means damage output won&apos;t be balanced on the same razor edge in Cataclysm as it is now. When increasing damage by 5% means you knock off 90% of a health pool in five seconds instead of 86%, that&apos;s pretty risky. When it means you knock off 40% of a health pool instead of 38%, that&apos;s not a real big balance changer. Numbers made up, but that&apos;s the general principle.<br>
<br>
Third, a greater focus on large-scale PvP will also probably help moderate the effects of changes like this.<br>

Pretty sure PvP gear will have mastery.<br>

Tanking is (not) hard!<br>
&apos;m just reading a lot of &quot;tanking is so hard&quot; threads, and A) we don&apos;t really agree, and B) if it&apos;s any less challenging I fear a lot of tanks may get bored and move on to other classes. There are some annoying parts of tanking we need to fix, and we definitely want to fix the threat scaling problem and any major disparities in AE tanking. But if you&apos;re looking for an experience even easier than tanking Naxx, I&apos;m not quite sure how to provide that given my A and B above.

Faction equality on servers<br>
The average alliance to horde ratio for Trollbane is 1.08:1. That doesn&apos;t take into account things like player participation, character level, interest in certain activities such as world PvP, etc. but the actual ratio is pretty much even.<br>
<br>
We do what we can to encourage faction equality though. If any situations arise that require our intervention we do so. We&apos;ve had realm transfers that only allow one faction to move, we&apos;ve shut down character creation for a single faction. We have methods to help balance realms or even battlegroups and we do use them, for all US realms at current and especially in this case though I wouldn&apos;t characterize it as needing that level of intervention.

Upgrading the original backpack<br>
We think about this one all the time, be it an upgrade to the backpack, or making it replaceable by larger bags. We&apos;d just have to be careful to not make it possible to have no bags equipped at any given time, because that would get messy. No guarantees on this one, but do know we&apos;re considering it. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/12947283189/storage-bag-upgrades/))<br>

Celestial Steed scaling<br>
We acknowledge that the Celestial Steed can seem a little out of proportion when especially some of the bulkier races are riding it, and this is something that is being looked into. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/13200302232/fix-req-celestial-steed-gfx-and-scaling/))<br>

AE Tanking in Cataclysm<br>
I didn&apos;t mean to imply that blowing Intimidating Shout is a swell idea on every AE pull. The context was a scenario that apparently comes up all the time where the warrior has recently used Thunder Clap and Shockwave and a whole lot of Morogrim-style adds pour into the room, leaving the hapless warrior without an AE button to push and solve the whole problem. I was pointing out that there are a lot of things you can do in that situation. Yes, if someone is about to die and you can&apos;t wait for Thunder Clap to come back up, then by all means use Intimidating Shout. That&apos;s what it&apos;s there for.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re just not crazy about the sound of any of these ideas that have the warrior able to use Thunder Clap and have it tick away on the mobs or on the ground to make sure things will stick to you no matter what.<br>
<br>
Warriors tanked for years without Shockwave and with a pretty wimpy Thunder Clap that only hit four adds. Yet, they still managed to handle a variety of fights, including this staggered adds situation that is the current hot topic button for this forum. I played a warrior tank a lot in that time period, and yeah, sometimes you lost aggro and sometimes you wiped. It&apos;s a lot easier today. I&apos;m not trying to use one of these &quot;back in my day, we tanked uphill in the snow&quot; arguments, but I am trying to get a sense for how easy you really want tanking to be and still have fun doing it.<br>
<br>
(Again, I&apos;m totally bought into the argument that AE tanking on live may not be as easy for warriors as paladins and druids. I&apos;m trying to establish how AE tanking should feel in an absolute, not a relative sense.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401521630/twitter-chat-on-warrior-aoe-tanking/))<br>
