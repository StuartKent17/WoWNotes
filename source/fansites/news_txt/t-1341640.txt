Patch 5.4 - Visions of Time: Courting Destiny
Patch 5.4 adds a quest line on the Timeless Isle that involves working for Kairoz  of the Keepers of Time  He is on the Timeless Isle because the Bronze Dragonflight is not as powerful as it once was, only being able to catch furtive glimpses through time. He has created an hourglass that will allow for a window into the timeways, but you must collect 50 x Epoch Stones  to make it usable. 

After collecting the stones, you embark on a series of weekly quests to use the Vision of Time  in different locations to calibrate the Vision of Time. Kairoz eventually will reveal  that there is a traitor among the Bronze Dragonflight.

As the hourglass grows more powerful, he will send you  to the Temple of the White Tiger to see a glimpse of Garrosh and Anduin, which is the scene you see below.
