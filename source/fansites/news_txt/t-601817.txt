Boubouille2007-08-29, 06:03 AMArena gear swapping
According to this screenshot http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/geardr1.jpg you can't swap gear in Arena since the latest build of the PTR patch. This could mean that this is a 2.2 feature, but it's still unsure because in a previous blue post http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=965654657&pageNo=1&sid=1#5 Nethaera stated that it wouldn't be in this patch. 

2.2 Item changes
Update : All screenshots are now updated with 2.2 PTR / 2.1 Live comparison. 

Yesterday, some items were changed during the PTR Patch. I'd say that my list is pretty much complete now. I'll add a screenshot of the Serpentshrine Shuriken and probably try to get a better version of enchantments when PTRs are back up

New paladin shield http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/illidariruneshield.jpg. Ilvl 141, could drop from pretty much anything in Hyjal or Black Temple, technically it could also drop from Vashj or Kael'Thas now that the ilvl of their loot is 141, but it's doubtful
All the weapons from Serpentshrine Cavern http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/sscchanges2.jpg were upgraded Including Wildfury Greatstaff http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/wildfurychanges.jpg and Serpentshrine Shuriken http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/serpentshrineshuriken2.jpg from trash.
All the weapons from Tempest Keep http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/tkchanges2.jpg were upgraded. 
The amount of reagents needed for several enchantments http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/enchantchanges3.jpg has been lowered.
[item=21756] cooldown has been changed from 30 minutes to 20 minutes.
[item=23565] attack power bonus has been changed from 58 to 84
[item=23576] required level has been changed from 55 to 60
[item=30067], [item=32540], and [item=32541] now requires 300 in enchantment skill to be disenchanted. 




Tigole interview on Mondespersistants.com
Mondespersistants.com http://wow.mondespersistants.com/?article=403&page_art=2, a french fansite, has interviewed Tigole and Chris Robinson during the Games Convention, the video and the transcript in both english and french is now available here http://wow.mondespersistants.com/?article=403&page_art=2.

As usual here is a short summary :
Arthas will "use" both alliance and horde players to defeat things that cannot be defeated by his brainless minions, the same way the Lich King used Arthas in the first place.
Death Knight will probably be able to use and inscribe any weapon with runes. Even if they might add a few Death Knight specific weapons
Few things about instance we already know, Azjol'Nerub will be a mega-huge underground zone full of spiders, the Nexus will have 3 instances and you will fight Malygos in the last one lvl 80, 25 players.
They might change old battlegrounds like AV, but they're still not sure if they will be able to do it because of the heavy changes it implies. 
Mal'ganis http://www.wowwiki.com/Mal'Ganis will be the final boss of CoT : Stratholme.
Sunwell Plateau will have 6 bosses in the 25 man raid dungeon, and a 5 people normal and heroic instance. 
A "famous character" is trying to re-ignite the sunwell and summons Kil'jaeden back.
