Warlords of Draenor Domain Changed
The WarlordsofDraenor.com domain we mentioned  last week changed early this afternoon to a Forbidden error from the domain parking page previously used. 

It also is now pointed to an IP address that Blizzard owns. Keep in mind that anyone can purchase a domain and point it to a Blizzard IP, as those servers currently respond to requests for any domain.
