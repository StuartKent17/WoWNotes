Alchemy Items Adjustments - Oct. 1
Alchemy is getting a few fixes tonight. At max rank: 


Battle Potion of Agility https://www.wowdb.com/spells/279161-battle-potion-of-agility now requires 8 x Siren's Pollen https://www.wowdb.com/items/152509-sirens-pollen down from 10 and 10 x Riverbud https://www.wowdb.com/items/152505-riverbud up from 8. 
Potion of Rising Death https://www.wowdb.com/spells/252346-potion-of-rising-death now requires 8 x Sea Stalk https://www.wowdb.com/items/152511-sea-stalk down from 10 and 6 x Star Moss https://www.wowdb.com/items/152506-star-moss down from 8.
Potion of Rising Death https://www.wowdb.com/items/152559-potion-of-rising-death now has a 20 yd minimum range for maximum effect, down from 30.
Potion of Bursting Blood https://www.wowdb.com/spells/252343-potion-of-bursting-blood now requires 8 x Siren's Pollen https://www.wowdb.com/items/152509-sirens-pollen down from 10 and 6 x Riverbud https://www.wowdb.com/items/152505-riverbud down from 8. 


With a hotfix that we're making to the game today, several changes to Alchemy items will take place:


The ratio of ingredients for Battle Potion of Agility https://www.wowdb.com/spells/279161-battle-potion-of-agility has been adjusted so that the demand for Siren’s Pollen https://www.wowdb.com/items/152509-sirens-pollen and Riverbud https://www.wowdb.com/items/152505-riverbud are more closely aligned in the long term.
The costs of creating Potions of Rising Death https://www.wowdb.com/spells/252346-potion-of-rising-death and Potions of Bursting Blood https://www.wowdb.com/spells/252343-potion-of-bursting-blood have been reduced. Since these potions have non-stat effects, it has been difficult to judge whether or not you should use them instead of stat potions. In practice, both contribute a similar amount of damage, but these potions are more constrained, since they are direct damage. We’re reducing their costs to make the decision of whether to use them or not more of a question of economics, rather than a question of straight throughput. The goal is for these potions to provide most of the effectiveness of a Battle Potion, at a lower cost.
To complement these changes, we're reducing the minimum range required for the Potion of Rising Death’s damage effect to reach full value. It will now be a 20-yard range it was 30 yards.


In the next major content patch, Tides of Vengeance, we’re going to update the Potion of Rising Death tooltip to read “damaging ranged abilities” instead of “ranged attacks”, to make it more clear this potion is functional for casters.

These hotfixes should go live very soon, over the next hour or two, and we'll have them noted in our hotfixes blog post later this evening.


Patch 8.1 Class Changes
Keep in mind this is still super early info! If the team is committed to making class reworks due to mechanical issues that Shamans, Prot Warriors, Shadow Priests, and insert your class here are asking for, then those take a little longer and start coming in later during PTR. 

Not saying anything specifically is coming but I know the team has been looking into mechanical issues with class rotations and functionality that have been raised and this is a current goal within 8.1. Just saying this to be as transparent as possible as all that has been seen is just numbers, and that doesn't fully represent what the team is working toward. 

TL;DR: more soon™ hopefully™

Hopefully? Is that a "Hopefully I'll have more soon!" or a "Hopefully they'll actually get around to fixing classes in this patch."?
Little of column A, little of column B, but I'd reword the second part a little if it was my words of course.

I say that just because you never know in development. There could be a unforeseen thing that pops up and delays this effort, so just throwing it in to cover all the bases.
