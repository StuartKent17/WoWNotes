As usual, I downloaded the patch from the downloader and it should be fairly safe, but of course you should use Blizzard Downloader if you&apos;re paranoid. <br>

2.2.2 PTR is officialy closed. Live servers are patched today (tomorrow for european servers). This also means that the 2.3 will be on PTR very soon <br>
<br>
Also, if you didn&apos;t have voice chat on your server, chances are it will be up and running today, check this post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2040599499&amp;postId=19996284190&amp;sid=1#0) for a list of the concerned US realms.<br>

New PvP trinkets in 2.3, PvP items available from heroic vendors<br>
Kalgan posted (again) very interesting details about the new PvP rewards in 2.3.<br>
<br>
There are a few new pvp oriented trinkets for 2.3.<br>
<br>
All versions of the trinket have a click effect to gain 1750 max health (kind of like the old lifegiving gem effect), along with a passive effect (your choice of 47 spell damage, 40 spell crit rating, 80 attack power, 40 melee crit rating, or 88 healing).<br>
<br>
Q: Any resilience?<br>
A: Nope, we did the clicky max health instead of resilience in this case (some players are at or nearing the resilience cap already).<br>
<br>
They&apos;re open to all classes. The click effects share a cooldown though, so you won&apos;t be able to stack that effect.<br>
<br>
And now the best part.<br>
Actually, they cost badges of justice, which will also be available off Kara and Zul Aman bosses.<br>
<br>
We like to encourage players to mix it up a little to a reasonable extent. Obviously, I can&apos;t argue that you personally will have more total fun if you also do a little PvE to go along with your PvP, but we do feel that for most players it adds up to a better overall play experience.<br>
<br>
That being said, you certainly can tank heroics in s2 gear.<br>
We can assume that most of the 2.3 items posted a few days ago could be heroic badges rewards, and not just a few more items buyable from the Arena/Honor vendor. It seems a good time to run as many heroics instances as you can. <br>

Death Knights Q&amp;A on official WotLK site<br>
A Death Knight Interview (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath/features/deathknight/interview.xml) and a Death Knight Lore (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath/features/deathknight/lore.xml) pages have been added to the official site. The &quot;interview&quot; is interesting but there isn&apos;t anything new in it.<br>
<br>
Summary of the interview : They added Death Knights because they needed more tanks (without replacing the existing ones), they want the DK to be a &quot;terrifyingly powerful warrior in heavy plate armor carrying around an enormous rune weapon&quot; but even if it&apos;s a hero class it won&apos;t be more powerful than the others. They will get old abilities from Warcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 fueled by the new rune system. <br>
<br>
<br>
Battlegrounds win/loss ratio<br>
More useful stats from Kalgan, who gave away win/loss % for each battleground, and explains why AV is getting changed again in 2.3.<br>
I think it&apos;s worth pointing out that generally speaking the win/loss percentages for WSG, AB, EotS generally fall somewhere around 55% to 45% on any given day (with Alliance also represented on the higher side). For example, on North American servers yesterday Alliance won more AB battles than the Horde.<br>
<br>
AV has gone through greater swings, with alliance winning as much as 75 to 80% of battles (NA servers again as an example) before patch 2.2 and horde winning about 60% so far after 2.2. That being said, there are a bunch of substantive AV changes going into patch 2.3 that will probably shake things up some more (more details on that sometime this week).<br>

Legendary ranged weapon<br>
A small post dedicated to scared hunters, don&apos;t worry, the evil warriors won&apos;t steal your shiny new legendary.<br>
We were planning to implement a Legendary ranged weapon soon, while I&#x2019;m not sure what class restrictions it will have, I kind of doubt many Rogues or Warriors are going to be able to say that they need it or will use it more than Hunters. Just my crazy thoughts though.<br>
<br>
Death Knights won&apos;t be a copy paste of paladins<br>
It was expected since we already knew that they&apos;ll have life stealing abilities, but it&apos;s now confirmed that Death Knights are selfish and probably won&apos;t heal you at all. <br>
Q: Anyone have any Idea how Death Knights will be in PvP? Coming from a mage, I am going to absolutely love not being OOMd by healers anymore. Just curious if there gonna be like a mage warrior combined!??!?<br>
A :I doubt that a Death Knight will excel in healing, that help. We&apos;ll have more details on this class and many other things as we get closer to launching Wrath of the Lich King.<br>
<br>
<br>
No new riding skill tier in WotLK<br>
Confirmed again, Blizzard won&apos;t add a new tier of riding skill in WotLK<br>
But we currently don&apos;t plan to add another tier of riding skill in Wrath of the Lich King.<br>
<br>
<br>
Warlocks and flying mounts<br>
There is no plan to give a flying mount to warlocks, start gathering your 2000 gold to get the cenarion expedition one if you want a shiny new mount. <br>
We do like adding additional flying mounts to the game, but it has to feel right when we do it. We didn&#x2019;t want to push for a ground version for the Druid in Azeroth, but waited for the expansion and the Druid Flight Form fit in great. While we have no Warlock specific ones planned, we do plan to continue making them like the Engineering and Cenarion Expedition mounts that are coming soon.<br>
<br>
2.3 Paladin changes<br>
I&apos;m adding this at the end because this is possibly a fake, this post is rumored to be official (and supposed to have been deleted during the weekend shortly after a blue posted it), but I&apos;d say that the fake-o-meter is going as high as 50%. The post was popular on the general forums so ... why not moving it here after all.<br>
<br>
The Tier 4, Tier 5, Tier6 and all Gladiator Sets have had their Spell Damage removed and the points have been reinvested in other stats, such as Strength and Critical Strike Rating.<br>
Exorcism mana cost reduced.<br>
Holy Wrath mana cost reduced.<br>
Hammer of Wrath mana cost reduced.<br>
Pursuit of Justice (Retribution) is now 3 ranks and increases movement speed by 5/10/15% and also reduces the chance you&apos;ll be hit by spells by 1/2/3%.<br>
The benefits of Improved Seal of the Crusader (Retribution) have now been implemented in the base spell. This talent now gives the benefits of the Sanctified Crusader talent instead.<br>
Sanctified Crusader (Retribution) is renamed to Sanctified Seals, and now increases your chance to critically hit with all spells and melee attacks by 1/2/3% and reduces the chance your Seals will be dispelled by 33/66/100%.<br>
Two-Handed Weapon Specialization (Retribution) now also reduces threat caused while wielding a Two-Handed Weapon by 8/16/25%.<br>
Weapon Expertise(Protection): In addiction to current effect now Increase Paladin Total hit points by 3/6/9/12/15 per level and convert 1/2/3/4/5% of all damage received in mana.<br>

Crusader Strike (Retribution) cooldown reduced from 10 to 6 seconds and does 110% weapon damage instead of weapon damage plus 40% of your Holy Spell damage.<br>
Vindication (Retribution) frequency and duration increased and now reduces all attributes by 5/10/15%.<br>
New Spell - Blessing of Defiance - Greatly increase Paladin&apos;s block value. Detail Coming Soon<br>
New Spell - Seal Of Protection -5 minutes cooldown Temporarily increase total Paladin Hit Points.Unleashing this Seal&apos;s will judge an enemy,decreasing all damage done by judged target.</div></div>
