As usual with new expansions it will include new loots cards, and amongst them is a new mount : the spectral tiger. <br>
<br>
Goblin Gumbo : Allows your character to occasionally burp outlandish gas on your friends !<br>
Fishing Chair : Lets you relax under your own personal umbrella while you fish for those big lunkers that add powerful attributes to your character when cooked! Players will love this!<br>
The Spectral Tiger Mount : No need to comment on this one....absolute coolness factor! <br>
