Now that Gamescom is over the last few interviews are popping up with a few interesting details. (via Digitalspy (http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/interviews/a336307/world-of-warcraft-interview-blizzard-on-post-cataclysm-patch-43-and-more.html), GameInformer (http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/08/19/blizzard-looking-to-make-quot-meaningful-difference-quot-in-world-of-warcraft-expansion-timing.aspx), Allvatar (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iguHmEb1wts&amp;feature=channel_video_title), and JudgeHype (http://worldofwarcraft.judgehype.com/index.php?page=commentaires&amp;n=125091))<br>
<br>
Patch 4.3+<br>
<br>
The new 5 man dungeons will help to introduce the Deathwing Raid.<br>
The current plan with the Deathwing raid is to have it all available immediately upon release.<br>
The Deathwing raid will be smaller than Ulduar with many phases or encounters with Deathwing.<br>
Patch 4.4 will bring a world event before the next expansion.<br>
The next expansion should be released with a &quot;meaningful difference&quot; in release timeline compared to previous expansions.<br>
<br>
<br>
Future Changes and Features<br>
<br>
Paid Guild Transfers are still in the works.<br>
Battle.net account wide achievements are still in the works.<br>
Armor dyes are unlikely to be included in the game, but mount customization is a possibility. <br>
Class Quests are unlikely to return due to the amount of time it takes to design and implement them.<br>
No gold sinks are coming soon because of the large variance in the amount of gold players have.<br>
A real money Auction House is not planned for WoW.<br>
<br>
<br>
Other Notes<br>
<br>
RealID LFD grouping was originally going to be paid because of the similarity to Paid Character Transfers, but they decided it was the right thing for the game to offer it for free.<br>
Cross realm RealID grouping is going to be expanded to cover Battlegrounds as well. Depending on how well that works it could be expanded to raids and rated battlegrounds.<br>
There has been a drop in gold farming because phishing and hacking accounts is more profitable.<br>
New players are still having trouble with the first 30 minutes and five levels of the game, more hand holding is coming for very basic concepts like moving, questing, fighting, and looting.<br>
Blizzard did a lot to save time while getting Cataclysm finished, but ended up happy with the final result. <br>
The shared 10 and 25 man lockout has had both positive and negative effects, it solved the need to do both every week but removed some extra content that could be done every week. Some changes will be made in the future to make everyone happier with the solution.<br>

Transmogrification of Heirlooms<br>
I&apos;d like to provide an update on this statement I made. It turns out that Heirlooms will be eligible targets for Transmogrification. Also (and this applies to all Transmogrified items), trading, mailing, auctioning or depositing an item in a guild bank will remove the Transmogrified art, returning the item in question to its original artwork. So, while you won&apos;t have to stare at the same old Heirlooms the whole time you&apos;re leveling, you won&apos;t be able to send a set of Heirlooms that have been Transmogrified with tier 13 art to your level 10 alt. <br>
<br>
[...] Mainhand can only be applied to mainhand, and offhand can only be applied to offhand. This is partially due to the restrictions on certain types of weapon art.<br>
<br>
Again, these are our first tentative steps with Transmogrification, and there&apos;s room for modifying the rules later on after the system is introduced, and we see how things shake out. Heck, the rules aren&apos;t even quite set in stone right now, and might change further before the system is introduced.

<br>
Transmogrification as a Gold Sink<br>
The gold cost for Transmogrification hasn&apos;t been set in stone, but it&apos;s likely to be very similar to Reforging, meaning it&apos;d scale with item level (probably the level of the item actually equipped). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/191985/transmogrification-the-next-cow-to-be-milked) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3053897324?page=2#27))<br>
<br>
Transmogrification Options<br>
The gear also still has to have stats aside from armor on it. That means that there are a lot of white or grey items that might not be available initially when Transmogrification goes live.<br>
<br>
As an aside, a lot of people have been asking about hiding shoulders, belts, etc. For now, it&apos;s looking pretty unlikely that we&apos;ll offer the option to hide anything aside from helm and cloak.
