<br>
In an effort to apply some of our upcoming 2.2 changes in a more expedited manner, we&apos;re hotfixing some elements of the Archimonde encounter. Not every planned change to Archimonde could be hotfixed, the other announced changes will occur with the release of patch 2.2. <br>
<br>
The following hotfix changes are now live: <br>
Archimonde now casts fear in a bit more consistent manner, roughly every 40 seconds. <br>
Fear&apos;s cast time is now 1.5 seconds. <br>
Grip of the Legion now has only a 60 yard range. <br>
Red Soul Charge now only silences players for 4 seconds. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The planned changes for Mother Shahraz could not be hotfixed, but we are working to resolve via hotfix the timing issue with Essence of Desire&apos;s Rune Shield and Spirit Shock. Working on that fix, we discovered that Rune Shield wasn&apos;t actually absorbing any damage. We&apos;re also working to fix that error. Since the Rune Shield is normally removed quickly, Essence of Desire still won&apos;t get much benefit out of the effect. Mages who Spell Steal the effect will be quite a bit happier, however.</div></div>
