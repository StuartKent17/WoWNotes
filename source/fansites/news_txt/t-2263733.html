Patch 7.3 - Fixed World Boss Rotation<br>
Patch 7.3 will change the world boss rotation to be fixed instead of random.<br>

World Boss Rotation<br>
The current world boss rotation is random, which means that there can be instances of the same boss spawning back-to-back or frequently across a number of weeks.<br>
<br>
In 7.3 we&apos;ll indeed, as Duvetlord noticed from Twitter, be switching over to a fixed rotation for the world bosses. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1068115-frozen-king-agian/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17616571928?page=1#4))<br>

Tier 21 Resto Druid Set Bonus<br>
There will be some logic attached to the Restoration Druid 4-piece set bonus for it to prioritize anyone except the Druid while Ysera&apos;s Gift is healing much more frequently. If only the Druid is injured, it should still heal the Druid. This change should be in a future PTR build.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m unsure if the build that went up today has this change or not, but I recently changed the 4-piece bonus to be a 100% chance on Wild Growth to grant 5 seconds of the Awakened buff (instead of 50% chance for 10 seconds).<br>
<br>
If that is not in the build that went up today, it should be in the next build.<br>
<br>
Just a bug, will be fixed in the next PTR cycle.<br>
<br>
The HoT from the 2p was incorrectly not able to crit and was not benefitting from haste.<br>
<br>
The 2p HoT also now benefits from your mastery just like any other HoT.<br>
<br>
Both of these changes should be in the next PTR build. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1068070-awkward-t21-resto-druid/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20758265845?page=1#9))<br>

Mistweaver Tier 21 Bonus<br>
I just fixed the 2 piece HoT to correctly be able to critical strike.<br>
<br>
The 4-piece bonus does not use a deck of cards, it is just a flat percentage proc rate. <br>
<br>
A few notes:<br>
<br>
- The HoT from the 2p bonus was not benefitting from haste, that will be fixed in the next PTR build. I also doubled the healing of this HoT.<br>
- The 4p healing/proc rate was just low. I bumped the heal up from .25 to 0.5, and the proc rate from 15 to 50%.<br>
<br>
Numbers are not final. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1068137-mistweaver-tier-21-concerns/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20758296197?page=1#9))<br>

Tier 21 Disc Priest Feedback<br>

I am investigating the issues with the Arms 4p and Fury 2p. I corrected the tooltip for the Fury 4p bonus. Thanks for the reports. <br>

Raid Testing Schedule - July 28-31<br>
On Friday, July 28th we will be conducting our first raid test of Antorus, the Burning Throne. If testing goes well, the zone will remain open over the weekend for Normal mode testing.<br>
<br>
Friday, July 28th<br>
<br>
Garothi Worldbreaker - Heroic Antorus, the Burning Throne<br>
13:00 PDT (16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST)<br>
<br>
Felhounds of Sargeras - Heroic Antorus, the Burning Throne<br>
14:00 PDT (17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST)<br>
<br>
War Council - Heroic Antorus, the Burning Throne<br>
15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 0:00 CEST)<br>
<br>
Once Heroic testing has concluded, these three bosses will remain open on Normal mode over the weekend.<br>
<br>
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br>
<br>
Q: How do I get into the raid zone?<br>
<br>
A: In Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade Sr. in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. (The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.)<br>
<br>
Q: What character should I use to test the raid?<br>
<br>
A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players&apos; effective level to 110 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounter(s) being tested. <br>
<br>
Q: How long does testing last?<br>
<br>
A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we&apos;re satisfied that we&apos;ve received that information for a given boss, we&apos;ll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.<br>

&#x201C;Play nice; play fair&#x201D; is one of Blizzard&apos;s core values. It&#x2019;s something we took to heart in creating Overwatch and remains a priority as we continue to support the game and our players. This not only applies to the new content we develop and the balance changes we make, but also to the features we add or improve upon over time.<br>
<br>
We believe that our in-game reporting and player penalty system is one of our most important features, and it&#x2019;s something we want to invest in significantly over the next year. To this end, effective immediately, we will be issuing increased penalties to players in response to verified reports of bad behavior. In Overwatch, that means anything from abusive chat, harassment, in-game spam, match inactivity (being intentionally AFK), and griefing. If you see someone engaging in any of these types of behaviors, report them. Players in violation will be silenced, suspended, or even banned from the game as a result.<br>
<br>
We know that making Overwatch a truly welcoming environment is an ongoing process, and this is only the first step. Over the next several months, we have plans to make additional improvements based on your feedback, including scaling competitive season bans, a notification system that will alert you when a player you&#x2019;ve reported is actioned, and functionality that will allow us to more aggressively penalize players who attempt to abuse the in-game reporting tool.<br>
<br>
We also remain committed to bringing a reporting system to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. As console players ourselves, we know it&#x2019;s been frustrating to not have this functionality on your platform. We are actively working on the feature and have many elements of undergoing internal testing right now. Our goal is to implement similar reporting options as are currently available on PC, and any improvements made to PC between now and when it&#x2019;s available.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your vigilance, passion, and commitment to building a welcoming and enjoyable community and helping us make Overwatch the best game it can be.<br>
