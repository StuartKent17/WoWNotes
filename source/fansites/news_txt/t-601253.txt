This morning, the Armor showroom http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=204 has been updated with the new tooltips, I'll progressively switch the whole site on the new tooltip system but it takes a lot of time to do it, stay tuned. Tier 6 Armor should be in the showroom soon.

Black Temple
Kaib from Bad Omen http://www.badomen.info/ made a post on Elitistjerks Forums http://elitistjerks.com/showpost.php?p=347388&postcount=33 with a few new loots, not posting more informations here because we're not sure if these are the final stats yet. Some items introduced in 2.1.0 had their stats changed in yesterday's update

Enchantments
Made a small compilation of new enchantments effects.

Weapons
Endarion again ! thanks to him sent me some screenshots with color variations of already known items even the tier 5 warlock sword has multiple colors. We can't really tell if it will be used in game in the near future, or if it will be released a lot later like it was in BC with the alternate version of tier 2 armor skins.
