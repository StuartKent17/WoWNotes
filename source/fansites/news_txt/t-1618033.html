Behind the Scenes of Lords of War...<br>
The road to The Dark Portal is paved with good intentions (http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090711231308/wowwiki/images/5/55/Path_of_Glory_-_Close-up.jpg).<br>
<br>
I wasn&apos;t implying the Iron Horde was responsible for the Path of Glory in Outland, but rather the Iron Horde&apos;s intentions (as far as they&apos;re concerned) aren&apos;t &quot;evil&quot;; their redemption is just misguided. The clans of the Iron Horde have been beaten down, oppressed, tortured, and marginalized, and one day a slick orc walks in with amazing technology and great power, telling them of a glorious future where they take back their honor and rule as conquerors of an entire planet. As repugnant as their actions ultimately are, those aren&apos;t intentions fueled purely by some ultimate evil. Which to me makes them far more interesting from a story perspective. Don&apos;t be fooled, these guys are bad, but not in the strict sense of the word. They have motivations, and intentions, and those are shaped by their experiences. Enemies that aren&apos;t just brainlessly evil is pretty cool, if not uncomfortably realistic.<br>
<br>
The Iron Horde have been set down a very dark path, and there&apos;s no sign of them veering from it. To make the wrongs against them right, they will pave a road with the bones of whoever oppose them, demon blood or not.

Classes<br>
Since Warriors kinda underwhelming visually attack side, glyph to make Whirlwind all fiery and such? Fits with theme, I&apos;d say.<br>
We don&apos;t disagree, it&apos;s a hot topic of discussion, many classic wow classes could use a visual overhaul. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524967539923619840))<br>

any plans on buffing Warlock? After the last &quot;hotfix&quot; they are at the bottom dps at 100 (with all specs).<br>
We&apos;ll adjust tuning as necessary at 100. We did a pass at 90 because it was too significantly off to leave for a month. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/524415598957064193))<br>
<br>
Art<br>
So I got excited about garrisons enchant transmoging but then realised I&apos;m a hunter.. any solution?<br>
Not immediately, but it&apos;s on our radar for sure. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524654316359917569))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
What changes besides dmg squish was Spine of Deathwing supposed to get that would make it easier to solo? They already in?<br>
He takes twice as long to roll if you are solo. Much easier to dance back and forth. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/524634458154991617))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
for example, i queue with friend in skirmish. he leaves arena, i have to leave arena to requeue with him.<br>
The functionality of the button is to queue people still in the arena. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/524590695257239553))<br>
<br>
with a 50% win rate, doesn&apos;t 200-250 skirmishes seem a bit much for one piece of gear? With healers, the games can be real long.<br>
You get more honor if the game goes longer. But longer games are still less efficient. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/524595390143021056))<br>
<br>
Can you confirm if there will be an honor wipe with Wod coming out?<br>
We don&apos;t plan on wiping honor. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/524595444757061633))<br>
<br>
Is there an official start date for season 16 (warlords season1)? Wondering if I can get conquest gear before raids unlock.<br>
Season starts the same day raids open (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/524701493950025729))<br>
<br>
Lore<br>
I think the plague is slightly hidden and too small to be seen, put some flowers and weapons around it!<br>
Nazgrim&apos;s axe maybe? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524653648047898624))<br>
<br>
Will we be seeing Sky Admiral Rogers again in a later patch? She is awesome.<br>
We like her and want to use her again. No word on when or where. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/524706791527944192))<br>
<br>
World<br>
Why do those weather stones need the limited charges? Going back to the isle to grind ain&apos;t fun.<br>
Things that affect how others see the world are often limited to preserve the world (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524656984587374592))<br>
<br>
Will the alliance get more candy buckets next year since they have 5 less than the horde now? Need more candy next year.<br>
Will investigate, thanks! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/525012985383628800))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
Thanks ! So can those Leatherworking tents be used on old continents and will there be new faction tents coming?<br>
The time limit is relatively short because they are fairly large and obstructive. We&apos;ll look into a use-anywhere one. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524655839437537280))<br>
<br>
Garrison enhancement suggestion: An actual toy box that becomes more impressive as you fill it with more toys. <br>
Might be cool to let you summon it as a toy anywhere, and ppl can click on it to get a random toy effect? Will consider. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524656201166888960))<br>
<br>
Are nameable garrison followers still a possibility for a WoD patch? My sister had lists of names ready, haha.<br>
Unfortunately, no, they have pretty extensive backstories and it would be weird to be able to force re-name them (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524656377604489216))<br>
<br>
There doesn&apos;t seem to be any difference between doing a mission with 600ilvl follower or 650. Intended?<br>
You should see an increase in the change to obtain loot from that mission, are you not seeing that? The bonus loot % (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524657702853545984))<br>
