Warlords of Draenor Stats and Items<br>
Will there be any secondary stats besides armor that will be useless to healers?<br>
Nope, all secondaries besides Bonus Armor will be useful to healers. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407604772049391616))<br>
<br>
From what I gather tank will have a unique secondary (armor) and healers (spirit), do DPS get a unique secondary?<br>
Current plan is no. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407649401700491264))<br>
<br>
Now, absorbs can shield for ~10% of your health, instead of ~24% - more room for direct heals (3/3)<br>
You guys are making incorrect assumptions about how much health pools are being squished. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407338900361728001))<br>
Are the health levels we saw at Blizzcon not a good indicator?<br>
Not sure what was in the BlizzCon build. Important bit: Base health is gone. All HP = Stam. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407340330170593280))<br>
And how does that work with freshly created characters who have no gear? Dumb idea.<br>
No gear doesn&apos;t mean no Stamina. Characters have base Stamina. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407340754315395072))<br>
Forgive me but I thought those things were exactly the same thing.<br>
Nope, very different. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407341541024223232))<br>
Can you link an explanation? The stuff I can find pairs the two terms together.<br>
Not sure what you&apos;re asking. There&apos;s currently base health and base stam. Base health is going away. All health will be from stam (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407349379079491585))<br>
<br>
Saw the comments on stamina. How will this affect Tauren with their Endurance racial?<br>
That&apos;s why I previously said that the ones guaranteed to be changed were the hit, exp, and basehealth ones. It&apos;ll be changed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407638027926646784))<br>
<br>
Blizzcon screenshots seem to show Player HP = STA x 25<br>
I believe it reaches 30 HP per Sta at lvl 100. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407341271942852608))<br>
<br>
Future<br>
Can we hope to see an ingame model of this (http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/186/6/5/female_broken_by_iseijin-d3l1rwg.jpg) one day? It would be awesome !<br>
cool drawing-not unless we revisit current Outland at some point. Broken aren&apos;t natural species on Draenor - demon influence. (Source (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/407978925441028096))<br>
<br>
Can you talk about DoTA style bg? Is it cancelled? Nonthing was said about it at blizzcon<br>
No plans for it right now. Maybe we&apos;ll revisit it in the future. Felt very &quot;me too&quot; with respect to the DotA trend. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407588364741664768))<br>
<br>
soooooo, will we have another season this exp or no?<br>
We have it in our back pocket if we feel like we need it. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407589250842902528))<br>
