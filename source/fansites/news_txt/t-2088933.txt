Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
What makes Blizzard content starves its community during the long time between expansions and not just in WoW but in Starcraft 2, Diablo 3, and Hearthstone
The Blizzard quality bar is really, really high. We would cancel features that were fairly far along in production because they didn't hit the appropriate polish level. We'd refuse to ship to a date clearly! when we didn't think the content was ready. As a player, I understand it really sucks. But it's also hard to argue that the Blizzard focus on quality hasn't worked for them over the long haul.

And, no, you can't speed up that time by throwing more people at the problem - mythical man month and all that. Often the barrier was just being able to find enough qualified people on this one planet. Source
