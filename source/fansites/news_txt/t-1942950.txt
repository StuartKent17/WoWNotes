Legion - Dalaran Portals
In Legion, Dalaran has a large assortment of portals. The old portals from Wrath of the Lich King are back, along with some new ones! 

Horde have portals to Orgrimmar, Undercity, Thunder Bluff, Silvermoon, and Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Alliance have portals to Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, Exodar, and Vale of the Eternal Blossoms. 

Both factions have access to portals in the new structure in the center of Dalaran. These are currently used for Artifact intro quest teleports, leading to Caverns of Time, Shattrath, Wyrmrest Temple, Dalaran Crater, and Karazhan.
