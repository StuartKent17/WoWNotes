Boubouille2011-05-17, 07:33 AMTier 12 - Warlock Multi-Race Screenshots
I'm done tuning things left and right to get decent previews of Tier 12 set and I'll start slowly with the warlock set! Expect a lot more screenshots in the next few days and of course videos, because a lot of people think their set sucks based on still screenshots or weird bugs in various modelviewers. Don't worry, it's not that bad. 

The video of the Warlock T12 set will most likely be available tomorrow, along with another class or two probably.

Capping Mastery Harder in 4.2
We are in the process of trying some different numbers for various talents and mechanics on the PTR, with the goal of making it harder or impossible to cap mastery. What we want to avoid is making mastery worthless or causing other undesirable effects.

If we are successful, we will adjust the other tanks to be relatively balanced with paladins again.

If we aren't successful, we know what the fall back position is basically what we have now.

At this time, we're in the middle of examining this and other changes. Please be reminded that we do read the forums, and appreciate feedback. A dispassionate perspective goes a long way.

More changes upcoming on PTRs
There are several changes we are trying, and the current PTR only reflects a fraction of them. Keep in mind that while we have a lot of changes we want to get in to every major patch, we also want to try and get builds on the PTR as frequently as possible so that we can test other things like Firelands encounters. We tend to grab builds often, not necessarily when every single change is in place.

Ask the Devs
The Q&As are designed so that we answer the top rated questions that the community has. Sometimes though, the questions asked aren't ones we can answer for you directly, but we try to answer what we can. So the choice is either to pretend that those questions don't exist and avoid them even though they were highly rated or to give whatever answer we can, even if it's just "We like it. We're thinking about it. We'll get back to you."

What we're trying to do is to give you some insight into what the development team is thinking and the processes involved. Sometimes that means giving an answer that explains why we don't want to do something or why something might be difficult to do. This is not putting off the question. It's just our way of trying to explain why we don't have a better answer for you at the time. We're trying to be as transparent as possible, but at the same time, there will always be some gray areas that even we are trying to sort out and we'd rather not mislead or give false hopes if we can avoid it. We'd much rather give what solid answers we can as we can when we can and when we get further along in design, talk about what we are able to do and doing then.

When we started these Q&As, we knew that disappointing people now and then with answers was something that would happen. But, we feel the benefits of doing these outweigh the negatives by far. We'd rather face the danger rather than run away away.
