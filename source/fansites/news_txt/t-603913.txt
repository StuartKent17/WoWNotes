Boubouille2007-12-20, 03:01 AM2.3.2 Patch and lag fixes
It seems that the latest PTR build didn't really improve the ping as much as expected, keep in mind that PTRs servers are always more laggy than live ones before crying too badly. And you can still use the lag fix I posted a few days ago, again, use it at your own risks

Anyway, there is still plenty of time to fix GCD and lag issues since we won't be getting the 2.3.2 Patch until 2008 No long maintenances during holidays, remember ?, Blizzard is working on it and this is why we're getting a new PTR Build today. 
There will be PTR maintenance tomorrow morning December 20th to apply a new build to the PTR realms.


Free Oceanic character transfers
This one will probably make a lot of people happy, Oceanic servers are getting free transfers and new servers. 
We will be offering free character moves from high population Oceanic realms to assist in population dispersal. The ability to move a character on the selected source realms will become available on Thursday, December 20 at 12:01 PM PDT, and are scheduled to run until Thursday, December 27 at 12:01 PM PDT.

In the event that a realm meets our transfer goals before the scheduled end date, the transfers to that realm will be disabled. We highly recommend that if you are planning to transfer that you do so at your earliest convenience.

Once the transfers open you can begin your transfer by visiting the Character Move page located here: https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html

Faster mounts in WotLK ?

New races in expansions
"I will repeat what I said in my earlier post in that we will not implement a new race or a new feature just for the sake of having one.

Using old reputations in expansions ?
It would be nice to re-use old reputations like Hydraxian Waterlords, but this won't be done to not put new players at a big disadvantage with the rewards. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3547586354&postId=35471879079&sid=1#5
