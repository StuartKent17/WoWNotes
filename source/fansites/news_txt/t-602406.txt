Boubouille2007-10-01, 05:41 AMFew more things about some items
I didn't have much time to talk about everything last week, we had already way too many things on the site. 
For all the warriors still wondering where they can get [item=33174], it drops from Enraged Air Spirits http://www.wowhead.com/n21060, Enraged Earth Spirits http://www.wowhead.com/n21050, Enraged Water Spirits http://www.wowhead.com/n21059 and Enraged Fire Spirits http://www.wowhead.com/n21061 in Shadowmoon Valley.
Terokk now drops [item=32782], it transforms you into an Arakkoa for 5 minutes and the best part is ... it doesn't fade when you change zone, take damage, fight, or anything like that. but you can't mount while transformed like any other transformation
I forgot to one loot from the Headless Horseman added in 2.2.2 during the halloween event, see the other loots in this post http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=1390.0, you can get an awesome pet from him called Sinister Squashling. It's a walking pumpkin that will dig itself in the earth when you don't move. Thanks to Beeble for the screenshots

Season 1 gear for honor at the beginning of Season 3
If you read this site often, you know that the Season 1 arena gear will be available from honor points vendor when the season 3 starts. However I missed a blue post written before the week end with a very interesting detail. I also added this to the list of PvP changes in the 2.3 "unofficial patch notes" just below. 
Update 12:00 : I should really sleep more, weapons will indeed be included, post was from 08.28 not 09.28 not my fault, blame Wildhorn
We've stated on numerous occasions that Season 1 items will be available from honor vendors, and this does include weapons.


Patch 2.2.2 and 2.3
Small reminder for the beginning of the week.
2.2.2 Patch
According to this blue post on french official forums http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=1016342728&sid=2, the brewfest should start on October 3rd. The 2.2.2 patch should be deployed on live servers tuesday and 
2.3 Patch
If you read this post http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1778517774&sid=1&pageNo=16#317 from Tigole, you will see that Blizzard plans to release the 2.3 on PTR this week, which means Zul'aman, new items everywhere, official patch notes for the classes changes, and more. 

This week will probably be a very busy one, if you're a member if you're not, go register ! http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?action=register you might experience some problem logging in while the site is in "omg server is burning mode".
