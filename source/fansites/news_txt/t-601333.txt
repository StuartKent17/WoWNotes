Boubouille2007-05-29, 10:33 PMArena point gain is intentionally different, and this is in-fact not a bug. A typical team will see a small change in their points, but players with very high or very low ratings will see a much larger change. Below is the new formula.

If rating<=1500 then
Points=0.38*rating-194
note: this calculation can go negative, but will be floored at 0

If rating>1500 then
Points=1426.79/1+918.836*Power2.71828, -0.00386405*rating

So ... What does it mean ? High-rating Arena teams will loose points, a lot of points.  And you can check how many here

This one shows how much points you lose compared to the last version. Posted on the official post by Zaleiria
