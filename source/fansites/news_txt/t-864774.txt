Firelands Patch 4.2, not 4.1  will be more than the raid instance originally promised, it will also include a new questing area and probably a couple of other surprises! Below is the ugly map of the area I made based on the minimap files and a couple of screenshots.

I don't have a lot more information about it for the moment, but it's still a nice sneak peek at the zone!

Note: It's Malfurion's Breach, not Reach. ><

Firelands Daily Zone - Screenshots

Disclaimer - These screenshots are from an early beta of the zone and are not representative of what you will be able to experience on live servers. Live servers will have a polished zone with monsters, tons of decorative elements, etc ... Anything that moves is basically not on these screenshots.
