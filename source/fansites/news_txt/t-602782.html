I wish I could say it won&apos;t happen again in the next days but ... I already said that so many times. ^^ Hopefully it should be fixed once and for all soon.<br>

<br>
<br>
WotLK spells in 2.3 files<br>
Omg &#xA7; WotLK &#xA7; No, seriously, these spells are probably here to make people happy with a WotLK name they know, but this is probably not the final WotLK version, the expansion is still very far from release.<br>
Anyway, they added the famous Death Knight&apos;s [spell=42650] ([spell=42651]), but most of the effect is a server-side script, actually it could be a spell used by a boss in one of the Sunwell Plateau instances.<br>

2.3 Screenshots<br>
The almost daily 2.3 screenshots, this time with an ... interesting addition to christmas event (Oh, there is also a [spell=44824] by the way, screenshot here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/flyingreindeer.jpg)). The second one is a screenshot of [item=33993] ! The new pet from Zul&apos;aman, you can get it by using the [item=33865] on frogs in Zul&apos;aman. (You won&apos;t get the pet everytime, it&apos;s a rare loot)<br>
