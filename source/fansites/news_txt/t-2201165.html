#422 (New) - Dearest $n, I look back upon our adventures together as if they happened yesterday. Several of my admirers informed me that you looked rather... sullen... when last we met. While I see no reason for such behavior when you had the pleasure of working with the world-renowned Johnny Awesome, I did feel a twang of... what was it... pity? Being as such, I felt it appropriate to send you this tip as a token of my appreciation for your efforts. Do people still tip? Listen, if people do NOT still tip, please return all attachments to me at once. I&apos;m not made of money, you know. -Johnny<br>
