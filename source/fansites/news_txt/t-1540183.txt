Tanaan Jungle: Assault on Another World
Blizzard posted a little bit of information about Tanaan Jungle today. You can find more details in our preview of the intro questline, Assault on the Dark Portal 
Warlords of Draenor sets you on a path into a brave and savage new world. It’s a chance to take hold of your heroes’ destiny and shape the Draenor of the past – and it all starts in a very dangerous place. Long before the planet was ripped apart and became Outland, Draenor was home to brutish clans of orcs who went to war across a treacherous landscape.

In primordial Tanaan, even the plants have teeth. Darkling fronds stab out at unlucky wanderers, or conceal canyons that plunge miles deep beneath the canopy - and these are far from the jungle’s worst dangers. Each day, warlords fell even wider stretches of Tanaan’s wilderness, striving to finally rend the gates of space and time for conquest unending.

Your first steps into Draenor will be within the wilds of Tanaan Jungle, where the Iron Horde has staged their assault on Azeroth. With these new attacks, you’ll be charged with leading the greatest heroes of this age in the counterstrike. This is an invasion that can’t be ignored and the Horde and the Alliance are both set on taking the offensive before it’s too late.

Your journey’s beginning in Tanaan Jungle is sure to present challenges – many of which have very sharp teeth – but it’s also where you’ll be introduced to some of the greatest orc warlords and heroes of all time. Unfortunately, the orc leaders of storied clans such as Grommash Hellscream  of Warsong clan, Kilrogg Deadeye  of Bleeding Hollow clan, and Kargath Bladefist  of the Shattered Hand clan aren’t going to be happy to see you. They won’t welcome you with anything other than unbridled savagery. You really shouldn’t expect anything to be on your side in this jungle.

Shutting down the Dark Portal is your first priority, but the mission may quickly go awry. Even if you do manage to seal the portal, your party will still be trapped in the middle of a hostile army. Your only option is to fight your way out! You might even be forced to accept the help of the infamous Gul'dan  Fortunately, you’ll also have luminaries such as Thrall , Khadgar , and Vindicator Maraad  by your side. You’ll also meet some new heroes who will take up arms for you: the brutal Frostwolf warrior Ga’nar, and a promising young draenei acolyte named Yrel.

For those newly boosted to level 90  in Warlords of Draenor your experience in Tanaan Jungle will gradually introduce you to your new class abilities and mechanics. You’ll still be able to join your friends in this new adventure while becoming acquainted with your new hero and taking on greater challenges and gaining greater rewards.
Your initial time in Tanaan Jungle will have an impact on your journey further into Draenor, and your first foray into its depths will be the jumpstart to your many adventures to come. While your time surviving the travails of this first adventure will be fast and a bit furious, never fear, this won’t be the last you’ll see of this terribly savage place.

Blood and thunder await you!


Upcoming Deserter Hotfixes for Rated PvP
As part of our continued efforts to curb exploitive behavior and improve the overall PvP experience for our players, we’re applying a couple hotfixes that will make a few changes to how the Deserter debuff functions, and also apply it to Arenas and Rated Battlegrounds.

Once these hotfixes are applied, a player who leaves an Arena or Rated Battleground before anyone in the match has entered combat will, at first, be given a 5-minute Deserter debuff. If they leave another match prematurely within a 20-minute window, the duration of the Deserter debuff will increase by 5 minutes each time and the 20-minute window will restart, to a maximum of 20 minutes. The debuff will also apply if a player leaves the queue or ignores it once the match is ready and they’re given the prompt to enter.

The Deserter debuff given for leaving a Random Battleground early will also be changed to begin at 5 minutes and increase by 5 minutes for each subsequent desertion, but otherwise the rules will stay the same. Leaving a Random Battleground in progress at any point before it’s finished will give the Deserter debuff, and leaving or ignoring the prompt to enter a Random Battleground will not.

We’re currently in the process of preparing and testing the hotfix, but hope to push it live with this week’s maintenance period.

Please run the possibility of making dampening apply faster in 2's by the PvP team. 2's is so bad right now, and this would be an easy fix. Possible 5 minute dampening would improve QOL in the bracket endlessly.
Dampening has been at 5 minutes in 2's for a while. 


Alpha Realms Offline - June 23 Update
To update everyone, we're in the process of working on a suitable alpha build to get testers into the Shadowmoon Valley Alliance experience. Unfortunately, given the nature of this process, we don't anticipate being able to bring the alpha realms back online today. Our goal is to identify a working build so that we can deploy it tomorrow for alpha participants to test out.

As always, we appreciate your patience and look forward to hearing your feedback about Shadowmoon Valley.


Free Faction Change for Select Realms
Holinka shared  some extra information about the free faction changes today.


  

We consistently watch queue times for all areas of the game to try to identify problem areas where we can step in and make an improvement. Battleground queue times specifically tend to be a direct result of how many people are entering the queue at any given time from both the Horde and the Alliance within an entire region. While a number of factors can lead to longer queue times, faction interest in queuing for PvP tends to be the primary one. For that reason, for a limited time and only for select realms, we'll be allowing Horde characters to changed their faction to the Alliance for free.

These faction changes will be provided on a limited basis to players on realms where we see the greatest potential for making an impact. Guild leaders who want to faction-change their guild for free will first need to pay for the initial transaction, but will be granted a refund* if they change to the eligible faction within the free-faction-change time frame.

Free faction changes will be made available to Horde players on Bloodscalp, Firetree, and Frostmane. Eligible characters will be able to transfer from Horde to Alliance for approximately** two weeks beginning on June 24. If you're looking to transfer—and especially if you’re a guild leader looking to initiate a guild faction change—we highly recommend taking advantage of this offer as soon as possible to avoid leaving anyone behind. For more information on faction change eligibility and limitations, please visit the support site here 

Eligible Connected Realms Included:

Bloodscalp

Boulderfist
Dunemaul
Maiev
Stonemaul


Firetree

Drak'tharon
Malorne
Rivendare
Stormscale


Frostmane

Ner'zhul
Tortheldrin


Players who wish to take advantage of the faction change will need to log in to the game to initiate the change.

We'll be providing updates on availability—as well as if this offer is extended to additional realms—here on the front page, so keep checking back. We look forward to your feedback, and we’ll continue to work to help ensure you spend less time in a queue and more time slaughtering your enemies in glorious team combat.

* Eligible Guild Faction Change refunds will be automatically processed within 72 hours.

**Faction Change availability may either be shortened or extended depending on ongoing evaluation during the transfer period.

Frost Presence. Is "reducing effects that remove control by 20%" supposed to be = to UH's runspeed? It's not.
Not exactly. The presences aren't designed such that they need to be precisely balanced. Celestalon 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Please keep Totemic Recall. I don't want to use default unit frames to manually dismiss totems.
What are the situations in which you need to dismiss a totem without dropping a new one? WatcherDev 
Other than aggro - we're changing it so that creatures simply cannot proximity aggro a totem. WatcherDev 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
will the "Of the Black Harvest" title ACC-WIDE? i know it is a warlock related thing but still, its not a pvp title
Account-wide but you can only use the title on warlocks if you happen to have multiple. WatcherDev 
I also assume that you have to be at least 90 to use the title?
As of... 5 seconds ago, yes. WatcherDev 

would making passive KJC have a punishing effect make it more balanced? after x stacks much you get rooted in place? less bloat?
The 5.0 version extended your cast time when you moved; it was considered terrible. Hard balance to strike. WatcherDev 

I know rbgs are not a priority but with the removal of felflame how do UA locks spin flags in rbgs now?
Not every class needs to have an instant cast spell to break a flag capture. Also, you have a pet. holinka 

Character / Items
Fury Warriors and Frost Death Knights uses 2 weapons to preform best, will quest rewards in WoD give 2 weapons?
Quest rewards will include enough 1H weapons for dual wielders. Don't think they come in pairs from the same quest though. Celestalon 
So for the "main" quest lines that you sad will give bigger rewards will still be just 1/2 of whats "needed?
There are more than one quest in a quest line. We don't just have rewards at the ends of them. Celestalon 

PvE
Since old LFR are not squished, any chance or could enlight us how loot will work there?
Same as it does today. WatcherDev 
/signed. Should at least open up trading for old LFR, but making it work like normal loot better
Understand the desire. It's far from a trivial change, but I'll look into it. WatcherDev 

PvP
upscale doesn't fix access to Abilities just nullifies hit and stat in-differences, so 19 has advantage over 10
Yes, this is to be expected. It isn't our expectation that level up battlegrounds be tightly balanced holinka 

ever thought about letting people 're-que' with the random bg team? miss getting to know pvpers, likerf before x-realm bgs.
yes it's something we're trying with skirmishes. The nature of battleground queuing doesn't allow it can't queue as a raid holinka 

Is there any plans for a Fel Reaver-style mob that patrols the Level 90 zones and one-shots fresh 90's with the absence of flying?
We're planning on having something like this in Ashran. A giant mob that your faction can build to torment your enemies! holinka 

Lots of rumors of *0 -* 9 brackets again in WoD. Even with upscale this is a bad idea, ability gaps, f2p dies too, hope its false
That was the plan. Would love to hear more about your concerns. holinka 
what happens to bgs that start at x5, like IoC 75 & EotS 35 - will they have a 5lvl bracket or accessed earlier? 70 / 30
I think they'll just be accessed earlier. Still evaluating the brackets and when bgs are available. holinka 

I mean the stat scaling moving into WOD for new characters how they will be different from current new characters.
I'll be completely honest with you that level 1-10 PvP is the very last thing I'm worried about. holinka 

Sir Holinka. I noticed that you buffed the fire-watchers oath, but could you look into allowing the use of censor in pandaria too?
No plans for the Censer to be usable off the Isle holinka
