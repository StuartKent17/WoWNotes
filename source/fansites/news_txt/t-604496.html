According to Nethaera, we might (finally) hear something new about the 2.4 next week, she also nicely explains why I spent the last two days deleting most of the &quot;2.4 Patch notes&quot; post from my forums. ^^<br>
We have information in the works, but I&apos;d caution people that it&apos;s not going to be today or even Monday, but we have plans and are working to put things together that will hopefully make the wait worthwhile.<br>
<br>
I&apos;d also caution people about getting their expectations up in regard to &quot;sweeping class changes&quot;. Again, we have many things in the works and a definite plan of action that we will share with you all more as we progress.<br>
<br>
As always, I&apos;ll remind people that if we don&apos;t post patch notes, they aren&apos;t the real deal. We create them, we post them, we make them reality. Don&apos;t supplant someone&apos;s fantasy patch notes for the real ones in your heads. It will only end in tears on so many fronts.<br>

Wrath of the Lich King - Bestiary<br>
The official WotLK site has been updated with a new feature : the bestiary (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath/features/bestiary/index.xml). <br>
Wrath of the Lich King will introduce a vast new land and many new dungeons to the game. A multitude of strange and terrifying creatures inhabits the frozen continent of Northrend, and you can now catch the first glimpses of the denizens of Northrend on our new Wrath of the Lich King Bestiary page. This page contains a sampling of the many new monsters you will encounter as you venture deep into the forgotten lands and desolate wastes of the Lich King&apos;s domain. The Bestiary (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath/features/bestiary/index.xml) will be updated regularly, so make sure to check back often!<br>
<br>
The first update features two monsters : the Nerubian Vizier and the Plague Eruptor.<br>

The half-spider, half-humanoid viziers (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/vizier.jpg) once served as advisors, sorcerers, and seers to the mighty nerubian spiderlords. But in the aftermath of the War of the Spider, the tables turned, and in the vacuum of their collapsed society, the cunning viziers rose to power. Utilizing their sorcery and high intelligence, the viziers have emerged as the rulers of the nerubians&apos; underground kingdom.<br>
<br>
It is rumored that the viziers themselves may serve an unseen emperor, one who is destined to lead the ancient spider-people to a final victory over the Scourge. While many can only speculate as to the existence of this nerubian emperor, some continue to investigate the link believed to exist between the nerubians and the vicious insect race known as the qiraji.<br>

Plague eruptors (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/eruptor.jpg) are the latest experiment of the Lich King, designed to spread horror and chaos across the world of the living. These walking corpses have quickly earned a reputation as the most destructive of the Scourge army: hyper-violent, incredibly strong, and deceptively fast. The most terrifying weapons in the eruptors&apos; arsenal are the myriad pulsing nodules that dominate their rotting skin. It is from these nodules that the undead plague festers and bursts, insuring that wherever the eruptors go, they quickly spread the Lich King&apos;s apocalyptic contagion.<br>

A lot of european realms have been affected by an unusual lag lately, especially during prime time, Blizzard is investigating the cause of the issue and will fix it as soon as possible.<br>

These are planned features for WotLK, but haven&apos;t been started yet, so no promises. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2968233433&amp;postId=42238533414&amp;sid=1#144))<br>

Mal&apos;ganis (Final boss of CoT : Culling of Stratholme (http://www.wowwiki.com/Culling_of_Stratholme))<br>
Mal&apos;ganis, an agent of the Burning Legion, was controlling the Lich King and in turn the Scourge. After Arthas had gone beyond the brink of sanity in trying to destroy the leader of the undead who had destroyed so much of his homeland, the Lich King told him to get his revenge and killed Mal&apos;ganis.

Restriction of the amount of Death Knights on the same account<br>
We still have awhile before we can say if there will be restrictions. Generally though, when something new comes out, people will flock to it. After a period of time, some will decide it&apos;s not what they want, that their guild needs something else or any other thing that will lead them away from playing a Death Knight exclusively. We plan to make sure the Death Knight balances in among all of the other classes.
