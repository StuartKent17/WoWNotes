<br>
We don&apos;t know yet how many players will be required to complete Zul&apos;aman, actually we&apos;re not even sure it will be a level 70 instance. When the Burning Crusade was announced it was supposed to be a low level raid instance at the end of the Blood Elves starting zone but it was &quot;changed&quot; to a level 70 instance, even if some people assume it will be made for 20 players raid, the success of Karazhan makes a 10 players version possible. <br>

We already know the appearance of two of them or at least two monsters related to them, the Eagle God, and the Dragonhawk God.<br>

<br>
From the list of the files already available in game, we can also assume there is a Bear God and a Lynx God. <br>

<br>
According to the files (again), the final boss should be Zul&apos;jin (from Warcraft II), but the first informations released about Zul&apos;aman also mentionned Warlord Jin&apos;zakk, who is &quot;A massive gray-furred Forest Troll with huge claws. He practices Dark Voodoo.&quot;<br>
