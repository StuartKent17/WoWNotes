World Event: Attack on Theramore Isle<br>
<br>
Warchief Garrosh, obsessed with assuring the Horde&#x2019;s supremacy over Kalimdor, launches an all-out attack against Jaina&apos;s island home of Theramore. Though valiant Alliance defenders rush to repel the sudden onslaught, they&#x2019;ll soon find themselves unprepared for the terrible scope of Garrosh&apos;s true plans&#x2026;<br>
In the Public Test Realm, we will be testing this event at specified intervals. Keep an eye on our PTR Feedback forum (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/1181024/) for more details as they become available.<br>
