Boubouille2012-01-23, 11:46 PMPatch 4.3.2 Going Live This Week
The information isn't official yet but assuming everything goes as planned, Patch 4.3.2 should be going live this week. This patch is bringing us Cross Realm raids for older content with RealID friends, a few item tweaks and new items, a few new achievements, and a reduced game client install size. It also brought testing of the 64-bit client which didn't appear to have widespread or major bugs, however I'm not really sure if it will be available on the live realms.

As usual there's a slight chance 1% that the patch will be postponed if something terrible happens, but as far as I know, we're good to go this week. 

Cross Realm Raids
We previously introduced the ability to form cross-realm parties with Real ID friends http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/190952-new-real-id-party-feature-now-live/, and now with Patch 4.3.2, we're adding the ability for players to use that same functionality to form raids to run older normal or heroic raids, or participate in Battlegrounds!

This will allow you to join up with your Real ID friends http://us.battle.net/en/realid/ from other realms and:

Form a cross-realm raid and use Raid Finder
Jump in to any classic dungeon or raid and be automatically placed in the same instance
Join forces and dominate the Battlegrounds


Please note, you will not yet be able to run normal or Heroic Dragon Soul with cross-realm Real ID raids.

As we look forward to the BattleTag system http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/209494-introducing-battletag/, it’s a very exciting time for World of Warcraft. No matter what realm you and your friends are on you’ll be able to team up and take on group content throughout the game.


4.3.2 PTR and New File Optimization Tech
With the 4.3.2 patch we’ll be testing some new file optimization tech. As you may be aware, with previous major expansion patches 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, etc. we’ve carried out a time-consuming process to reorganize the game files currently installed on your hard drive to integrate all previous patch files, essentially ‘cleaning up’ what’s on your computer and reducing the full installation size. This process used to require an amount of free hard drive space double that of the entire installation size to complete, which is why we’ve reserved them for large expansion-sized patches.

The new tech we’re testing with the 4.3.2 PTR will process these cleanups with no additional hard drive space required beyond what the patch is adding. Because of that you may see them appear more frequently with patches.

While the cleanup is occurring you’ll see a specific message on the launcher informing you the process is currently taking place. If you encounter any issues with the new process please be sure to visit our support site at http://www.battle.net/support/

Items
Vial of Shadows http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/77207/vial-of-shadows/ had the proc damage cut in third and proc frequency tripled to reduce burst in PvP.

Many of the original level 60 ranked PvP gear items have had Replica added to the start of their name, making their name identical to the versions being sold in Area 52, for example the Replica High Warlord's Cleaver http://db.mmo-champion.com/item/77580/#15050/15148. However, they still retain their higher item level and stats.

Gurthalak, Voice of the Deeps http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/78487/gurthalak-voice-of-the-deeps/ had its proc time increased to 12 seconds from 10 seconds. This change was made to all three versions of the item.

The three new items added in Patch 4.3.2 are found on the TCG Loot vendor in Booty Bay. They are part of the Timewalkers: War of the Ancients expansion. Feldrake http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79771/feldrake/, Eye of the Legion http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79744/eye-of-the-legion/, and Demon Hunter's Aspect http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79769/demon-hunters-aspect/
