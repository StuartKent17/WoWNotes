Apexis Crystal Bonus Event August 21 &#x2013; 24<br>
During the Sign of Apexis bonus event, you&apos;ll gain bonus Apexis Crystals from eligible creatures. Furthermore, completing the this-bonus event-only quest &quot;The Time to Strike (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/39033-the-time-to-strike)&quot; awards a sizable amount of Oil to fuel your Naval Missions, in addition to a big pile of Apexis Crystals.<br>
<br>
The point of picking up lots and lots of extra Apexis Crystals is, of course, to spend them! Here are some of the possibilities.<br>
<br>
For most players, spending Apexis Crystals on gear upgrades is a great way to improve your overall item level. There&apos;s something for every slot at item level 650, so if you&apos;ve still got a low-level item in one or two slots, you&apos;re covered. Visit Ravenspeaker Thelnaas (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/96130-ravenspeaker-thelnaas) in Tanaan Jungle to buy armor for 5,000 Crystals apiece, a weapon for 10,000 Crystals, and Empowered Apexis Fragments for 20,000 Crystals. Empowered Apexis Fragment (http://www.wowdb.com/items/128225-empowered-apexis-fragment) are Battle.net Account-bound, and upgrade your Baleful gear from ilvl 650 to ilvl 695.<br>
<br>
Some nice new collectibles came along with Tanaan Jungle. You&apos;ll want to consider:<br>
<br>
<br>
Reins of the Corrupted Dreadwing (http://www.wowdb.com/items/123974-reins-of-the-corrupted-dreadwing) mount (150,000 Apexis Crystals)<br>
Rukhmar&apos;s Sacred Memory (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122283-rukhmars-sacred-memory) toy (50,000 Apexis Crystals)<br>
Blazing Firehawk (http://www.wowdb.com/items/128478-blazing-firehawk) pet (2,000 Apexis Crystals)<br>
Solar Priest Vayx (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/followers/582-solar-priest-vayx) follower (1,000 Apexis Crystals) <br>
<br>
<br>
The bonus weekend is underway, and runs through the end of the day on Monday, August 24.<br>
<br>
What are you aiming to buy with your extra crystals?<br>

Grove Warden Mount<br>
I really hope you&apos;re conscious that seeing this mount in the store freaks everyone out concerning legion rep rewards<br>
I&apos;d heard similar feedback before but it was pronounced this time, thanks! I get you. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/633535862551113728))<br>

Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Story<br>
As a games designer, do you ever think you would let us, the heroes loose in an expansion!? we cant always win surely <br>
As a narrative device I think this is fun but you have to sell &quot;won every battle but lost the war.&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/630877148031553537))<br>
Because it likely won&apos;t be fun for the player to just lose every fight. They still need to win a lot for a sense of satisfaction. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/630877250934583296))<br>
Consider Empire Strikes Back: the retreat from Hoth (spoiler) was a victory but not a victory like driving the Empire back. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/630877491024953345))<br>
