Azshara’s Eternal Palace

Queen's Court

Fixed an issue where casting either Moonfire or Regrowth twice in a row while affected by Repeat Performance https://www.wowdb.com/spells/304409-repeat-performance was not triggering the silence.
Fixed a bug on Mythic difficulty where the damage effect from Deferred Sentence https://www.wowdb.com/spells/304128-deferred-sentence could trigger the healing reduction from Obey or Suffer https://www.wowdb.com/spells/297585-obey-or-suffer right as the decrees transitioned between each other.

Queen Azshara

When either Aethenel or Cyranus is slain on Normal, Heroic, or Mythic difficulty, there is now a 3-second delay before the other one gains the Torment https://www.wowdb.com/spells/297912-torment buff.
Azshara's Indomitable https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/155354-azsharas-indomitable is now summoned 10 seconds later than previously observed on Mythic difficulty.
Tidemistresses have 5% less health on Mythic difficulty.


Siege of Boralus 

Corrected an issue where players’ pets were unable to attack the tentacles during the Viq’Goth encounter.



Items

Heart of Azeroth

Vitality Conduit https://www.wowdb.com/spells/299959-vitality-conduit Essence correctly transfers health from a target with absorb shields on them.
