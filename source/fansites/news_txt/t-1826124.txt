Garrison Resource Quest Rewards Hotfix
The Tanaan daily quests and first dungeon daily now reward more Garrison Resources than before! This should help players that are constantly swapping out equipment for Naval Missions. The new rewards are listed below.

Character Name Release Requests
We often receive requests from players to free up a character name. Customer Support will no longer assist with releasing names. Instead, names will automatically become available if the account that holds the name has remained inactive for the past two expansions.

For example, if an account has been inactive since before the Cataclysm expansion, all names on that account will be made available when the Warlords of Draenor expansion launches.

If you are an active player, there is no need to worry that your character names will be changed, even if you have been playing other characters for a while.

Timewalking
I think the tuning for Timewalker this week was a little off. Any way the XP gains from it could be nudged up? Barely got any
We’ll be looking at the XP that leveling players receive from Timewalking; we agree it could be more rewarding. WarcraftDevs 

Achievements
Tune-o-Tron micro in the toy box says it needs "More Hit Tunes" achieve but there is no achieve called that
The portable audiophone was accidentally added twice; there is a duplicate entry with an older name and it's fixed in 6.2.1. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
Remove the Ancient Artifact. It ruins Ashran, especially when it's small scale.
We are going to prevent it from spawning when populations are low. holinka 
You're completely missing the point. Populations are ALWAYS LOW, and AA is guaranteed "I win" now
What region are you in and what time do you play? We see low populations at off-peak times but not always. holinka
