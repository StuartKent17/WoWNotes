Spell Changes
Spell changes are here and as usual keep in mind that:

It's the beginning of the beta and shit is changing so fast that it's a miracle that everything doesn't explode in our face. A few things look weird, we'll try to figure them out over the next few hours to make sure we didn't do anything stupid!
