Heroic Suramar Raid Testing Schedule - March 4
On Friday, March 4, we will continue our Legion Alpha raid testing of Heroic encounters.

Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Our general plan is to test every encounter on Heroic difficulty first, and then test sections of the raid on Normal and Raid Finder, alongside targeted Mythic tests. Apologies for the short notice, but we needed to ensure build stability. If you can't make this testing window, these bosses will be retested, likely more than once, in the future.

Friday, March 4

Chronomatic Anomaly - Heroic Suramar Raid
13:30 PST 16:30 EST, 22:30 CET

Trilliax - Heroic Suramar Raid
14:30 PST 17:30 EST, 23:30 CET

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of an alpha environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.

Q: How do I get into the raid zone?

A: In Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade Sr. in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.

Q: What character should I use to test the raid?

A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players' effective level to 110 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounters being tested.

Q: How long does testing last?

A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we're satisfied that we've received that information for a given boss, we'll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.


Legion PvP
Honor System Grind
Thank you for having the discussion. To provide some more information, here are the honor requirements for each level. We intentionally have the initial levels with less honor so that you are able to get a PvP talent in each row very quickly by level 10.

Levels 1-10: 750 honor
Levels 11-20: 875 honor
Levels 21-30: 1000 honor
Levels 31-40: 1125 honor
Levels 41-50: 1250 honor

In total, it takes 50,000 honor to reach level 50.

Okay! good to know it will scale higher, will is also get higher each prestige level? 
That is not the plan at this time but certainly worth considering. Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742644809?page=1#10

PvP Testing in Legion has Begun
We need to gather a lot of data and feedback about the experience of leveling up in the new honor system. Currently, we haven't completed a full pass on tuning class and artifact abilities, so balance is going to be a bit off. Certainly, we want to hear about spells that do extreme amounts of damage or healing to the degree they make testing unattractive for you. But you should expect balance to be far from perfect.

Blue Posts
Second Artifact Weapon
This is definitely a valid concern. Right now the plan is that you'll be able to obtain your second artifact fairly early into the level-up experience in Legion. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/403440-legion-leveling-up-with-your-offspec/ / Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17610641335?page=1#2

Secondary Stat Scaling in Legion
The point I'm getting at is that if primary stats have no diminishing returns like secondaries, the ratio of primary to secondary will mean that THE BEST piece of gear at the end of the game will always simply be the highest ilevel.
Because your primary stat is just so much stronger than the secondary stat values.
Primary stats are of additive value. Secondary stats are of multiplicative value. This is why Primaries are more valuable toward the start of an expansion raising your base damage early on, when you don't have much base damage, and Secondaries are more valuable toward the end of an expansion when you've already got a high base damage, so it's more valuable to raise the multiplier on that high base damage. This change will make them more equal throughout the whole expansion. Regardless, we almost never make you choose between Primary and Secondaries.

We're still tweaking the exact rating conversions and coefficients to get the desired effect. It's already changed a bit since that build was made rating conversions will be 275/300/300/350 in the next build, instead of the 227/250/250/295 they are in the current alpha.

Restoration Druid Feedback -- Build 21232 -- 3-Mar
All healing spells being usable in Moonkin Form is a bug--next build, it should be back to working how it has been in alpha, where Healing Touch is the only healing spell that can be used in Moonkin Form.

Discipline Priest Feedback -- Build 21232 -- 3-Mar
Schism is indeed meant to improve Atonement healing; that is fixed in the next build. It will also be buffed to compete better with Castigation.

It is intended that Divine Star and Halo only Atone once per cast--this allows them to deal AoE damage without resulting in overpowered Atonement healing in multi-target situations.

Not a bug. It gives you the buffs of whichever symbol you roll the most of. Multiples happen when there are ties.

Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
What do you see as the best all-round raid you were involved with? I'll go with ToT
That one was good, though maybe too many animals and not enough enemy army. Maybe 2nd after Ulduar? OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/702158995004329984
Is it fair to say that what made Ulduar great can't be done again? And if so, is it truly the best, or simply the 1st great?
I don't see why it couldn't be done again. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/702181509021609984
I meant the Hardmode buttons and teleportation. It was exciting, but is that a recipe you can re-use?
Hard mode, no. We were already low on ideas after Ulduar so we moved to a UI button. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/702198459961470976

on that word - Describe a boss if you could design one :P I'm honestly curious
I always wanted to do a multi headed dragon. Maybe even 2 heads. No, not Chromaggus. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/702181803688271877
Or even Megaera?
Chimaeron's heads weren't super relevant to the fight, and Megaera felt like separate creatures. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/702235423003705344
I'm imaging more like a traditional Vael fight with a split raid or head phases or something. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/702235507502161920
