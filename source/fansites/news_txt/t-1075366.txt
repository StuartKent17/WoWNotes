Boubouille2012-02-02, 10:55 AMRetribution Paladin DPS Bug
Mini news post to point out that Blizzard is already working on the bug affecting Retribution Paladin DPS after the latest server restart. He also reminded everyone that exploiting that bug can get you suspended, rewards for you and your raid removed, etc ... So it's probably safer to not do it, it will be fixed soon enough. 
We're aware of this issue and looking into it right now. It's likely we won't have further updates for you until we're back in the office in the morning PST.

Just as a reminder from the Terms of Use:

C. Rules Related to Game Play.
i Using or exploiting errors in design, features which have not been documented, and/or "program bugs" to gain access that is otherwise not available, or to obtain a competitive advantage over other players. 

As of now, the bug seems to be fixed on some realms but it seems to still be affecting other servers.
