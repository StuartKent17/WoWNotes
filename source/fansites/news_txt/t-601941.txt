Thyvene a french Community Representative posted something very interesting for enchanters. I don't expect you to read french so here is the translation. 

The developers plan to give to enchanters the possibility to sell their enchantments at the auction house, however this shouldn't be implemented into the game before the next expansion, Wrath of the Lich King
