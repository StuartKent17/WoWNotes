This is now official, the sets we posted earlier are indeed the Tier 9 Armor models and multiple classes within the same faction will share the same armor model with different textures. 
In patch 3.2, Call of the Crusade, players will be able to work toward the all-new tier-9 class sets by competing in the Crusaders' Coliseum. To keep with the themes of the Argent Tournament, players will notice this time around that the Horde and Alliance have unique looks to distinguish them apart. 


Alliance Mage

 


Horde Hunter

 


Alliance Priest

 


Horde Shaman

 


Alliance Warlock

 

Below are the non-official preview of the Plate Alliance and Leather Horde sets I posted a few days ago.
