Boubouille2007-04-29, 07:40 PMAs you probably know if you checked the 2.1.0 Informations topic , the 2.1.0 patch will add more meta gems to the game. 
Last week I only "found" two of them but I got lucky yesterday and found another two. They're the two "unstable" on the left




If you don't know what to do tonight, you should also check Unlimited Escapism vol. 2  It was released yesterday and it's got very nice scenes, you can also check the vol. 1 here  if you missed it.
