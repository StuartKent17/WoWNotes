If you don't know what to do tonight, you should also check Unlimited Escapism vol. 2 http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=39221. It was released yesterday and it's got very nice scenes, you can also check the vol. 1 here http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=37245 if you missed it.
