<br>
A few important things to keep in mind:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you have a lot of money and don&apos;t feel like farming Love Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49927/love-token/), you can buy Lovely Charm Bracelet (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49916/lovely-charm-bracelet/) from other players and exchange them for Love Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49927/love-token/) at any Love is in the Air rewards NPC without any limit. If you really want to show off on your server and be the first with the mount, that&apos;s the way to go. <br>
The Swift Lovebird (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/72146/swift-lovebird/) mount and the Truesilver Shafted Arrow (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/22235/truesilver-shafted-arrow/) companion pets are not bind on pick up and can be bought at the Auction House. Obviously, it also means the event is a good opportunity to farm something valuable and sell it if you&apos;re short on cash. <br>
Don&apos;t forget the other mount, Big Love Rocket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50250/big-love-rocket/) from the daily dungeon encounter! <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Crown Chemical Co. Encounter Rewards<br>
The Crown Chemical Co. Encounter is now available in your Dungeon Finder and you can run the event as much as you want to get one of the rare necklaces. As far as we know they haven&apos;t been updated this year and it&apos;s very likely that you have something better than the ilvl 346 rewards you get from the encounter.<br>

<br>
You also get Heart-Shaped Box (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/54537/heart-shaped-box/) once a day, the box has a chance to contain one of the following rewards:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Forever-Lovely Rose (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49715/forever-lovely-rose/) will replace your hat and show your character holding a rose between his/her teeth. Cannot be used in transmogrification.<br>
Vile Fumigator&apos;s Mask (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50741/vile-fumigators-mask/) is an awesome looking fumigator helm but sadly cannot be used for transmogrification. <br>
Toxic Wasteling (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50446/toxic-wasteling/) is a companion pet that will grow in size if you let it eat critters! <br>
The Heartbreaker (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50471/the-heartbreaker/) allows you to break hearts ... why would you do that? You&apos;re mean. <br>
Big Love Rocket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50250/big-love-rocket/) mount has a very small chance to drop from the box, and is the only reason why you will run the encounter every day. <br>

Farming Love Tokens<br>
There are a couple of ways to acquire Love Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49927/love-token/) and they&apos;re all pretty simple, you can even grind them if you absolutely want all the rewards as fast as possible. <br>
<br>
1. Crushing the Crown Daily Quest<br>
Crushing the Crown (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/28935/crushing-the-crown/) starts from the Love is in the Air quest giver in Stormwind/Orgrimmar and requires you to destroy a chemical wagon in Uldum. Lower versions of the quest are also available (http://db.mmo-champion.com/search/all/Crushing_the_Crown/#table__search_results_quest=1%3A-required_level). Rewards Love Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49927/love-token/) x 5.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
2. Gifts to Faction Leaders Daily Quest<br>
Daily quests to give Gifts to faction leaders are also available. You can start the quests by talking to Kwee Q. Peddlefeet in any capital city, <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Alliance players can present a gift to the leaders of Ironforge (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24609/a-gift-for-a-lord-of-ironforge/), Darnassus (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24610/a-gift-for-the-high-priestess-of-elune/), Stormwind (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24597/a-gift-for-the-king-of-stormwind/) and The Exodar (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24611/a-gift-for-the-prophet/). <br>
Horde players can present a gift to the leaders of Undercity (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24613/a-gift-for-the-banshee-queen/), Thunder Bluff (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24614/a-gift-for-the-high-chieftain/), Quel&apos;Thalas (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24615/a-gift-for-the-regent-lord-of-quelthalas/) and Orgrimmar (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24612/a-gift-for-the-warchief/). <br>
<br>
<br>
You can complete all 4 quests every day, but you will have to travel to each capital city to start them. The quest itself requires you to kill 10 monsters (green difficulty or higher) with the Lovely Charm Collector&apos;s Kit (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49661/lovely-charm-collectors-kit/) in your inventory (provided automatically when you start the quest) to gather 10 x Lovely Charms (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49655/lovely-charm/) and change them into a Lovely Charm Bracelet (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49916/lovely-charm-bracelet/)!<br>
<br>
Completing one of those quests will reward you with Love Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49927/love-token/) x 5 and completing all 4 will get you 20 Tokens each day. (Yes, my maths skills are impressive) <br>
<br>
3. Samples Random Daily Quest<br>
You will randomly get one of the 3 free samples quest each day. A Perfect Puff of Perfume (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24629/a-perfect-puff-of-perfume/), A Cloudlet of Classy Cologne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24635/a-cloudlet-of-classy-cologne/), and Bonbon Blitz (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24636/bonbon-blitz/) all require you to use an item 10 times on other players or NPCs. Pretty easy way to get another Love Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49927/love-token/) x 5 every day. <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Love Is in the Air Customer Support Policy<br>
Love is in the Air from February 5-20, and with these romantic feelings comes one of Azeroth&#x2019;s many special world events! World events are a time for players to celebrate in-game holidays, acquire special vanity items or pets, and earn those much sought-after achievements. As these things are highly valued by our players, our support staff is available should things go awry. If you&#x2019;d like to learn more about this event, be sure to check out our Community Blog.<br>
<br>
There are some situations, however, in which there may be limitations to the assistance we can provide. While some of the policies below are primarily aimed at our world events, they are all in line with our other more general support policies. As always, exceptions may be made, particularly in the case of extenuating circumstances or bugs. Keep an eye out for such issues by visiting our Support Site (https://us.battle.net/support/en/) and searching for the issue you are experiencing, or checking the Breaking News (https://us.battle.net/support/en/news).<br>
<br>
Event Item Purchases<br>
Many holidays provide special forms of currency, usually tokens or other exchangeable items, with which purchases can be made from limited availability vendors. Many of the items from these vendors may be necessary to complete achievements associated with world events, so they are often highly coveted. The majority of these items are non-refundable, and this functionality is intended. As a result, make your purchases wisely, as Game Masters will be unable to facilitate such refunds.<br>
<br>
Achievement Related Issues<br>
For many, world events are one of the most convenient means to acquire achievements. Achievements represent overcoming extreme odds, having a bit of luck, and generally serve as a milestone for your character to proudly show off. Achievements are, by definition, accomplishments that require skillful effort and often a non-trivial amount of time to earn. Because of the intent behind achievement design philosophy and tool limitations, Game Masters are unable to grant, remove, or alter achievements in any way.<br>
<br>
Limited Duration Events<br>
World events can make time fly by quickly, so make sure that you get all your achievements, quests, and special events done before it&#x2019;s too late! While availability may be limited, Game Masters are only able to provide restorations if they have accompanying logs to prove that a loss occurred. If the item was never acquired or the quest never completed, a restoration isn&#x2019;t usually possible.<br>
Also bear in mind that the event end date will always be listed in your Events Calendar in-game, and the deadline corresponds with realm time, not your local time. We highly advise making certain all your tasks are completed well in advance, and wish you all the best throughout your seasonal adventures!</div></div>
