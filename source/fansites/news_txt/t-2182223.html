So if you have a competitive bone in your body (and who doesn&#x2019;t?), read on for an overview of the exciting changes. There are many ways you, your team, and your community can get involved.<br>
<br>
But first, a quick&#x2014;and epic&#x2014;reminder of what you can expect. . . .<br>

<br>
<br>
More Teams, More Action<br>
This year, there&#x2019;ll be more opportunities to prove your teams&#x2019; prowess on the world stage:<br>
<br>
<br>
Extra qualifier cups in North America and Europe, giving more teams the chance to shine.<br>
Open signups: you don&#x2019;t need an Arena rating to sign on the dotted line. What&#x2019;s stopping you?<br>
The top eight teams will be broadcast live, giving your team the chance to show off epic skills and the audience good reason to cheer on the teams they&#x2019;re passionate about.<br>
Prize pool of $6,000. Each. Pretty sweet. *nods*<br>
<br>
<br>
Points Win Prizes: How to Qualify<br>
To advance, teams can earn points through a variety of events:<br>
<br>
<br>
Online Arena Cups award points to the top teams, so the teams with the most points qualify to their regional LAN event.<br>
Teams can sign up to compete in as many cups in their region as they want. Go, go, go!<br>
Approved community-run events can also award points&#x2014;so what better reason to encourage your community to get involved? The more points you have, the more chance you have of qualifying. Simple as that.<br>

Note that points are earned by teams, not individuals, so leaving your team means leaving some of your points behind. Safety in numbers, friends!<br>

Season 2 &#x2013; End of Season Rewards<br>
If you participated in Season 2, in order to ensure you receive the rewards that you&#x2019;re due, please keep the following in mind:<br>
<br>
<br>
Refrain from transferring your character(s) to another realm or faction until after Legion Season 1 has ended.<br>
Legion Season 2 titles and mounts will be awarded approximately two weeks after the season ends.<br>
<br>
<br>
Season 3 Updates<br>
With Legion Season 3, the maximum number of times you can Prestige will increase from 9 to 13.<br>
<br>
Faction-based Rewards<br>
Don&#x2019;t forget&#x2014;end-of-season rewards are based on your faction. The top 0.5% of Alliance PvPers will be awarded the Gladiator: Legion Season 2 achievement and mount, and the same will go to the top 0.5% of Horde PvPers. If you transfer your character to the other faction, you must have 50 wins after your transfer to receive the reward.<br>
