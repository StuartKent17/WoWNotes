Boubouille2007-05-14, 08:02 PMNew PTR Patch tonight.
The Test realms will be brought down today at 1:00 p.m. PDT for a patch and maintenance. The expected down time is 3 hours and the realms should be available at 4:00 p.m. PDT.

Before the PTR downtime, Curse http://www.curse-guild.org did a few tries on some bosses of the Black Temple and successfully killed High Warlord Naj'entus and Gurtogg Bloodboil, they also fought Teron Gorefiend but didn't manage to kill him partially due to a bug in the encounter
