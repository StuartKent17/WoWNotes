<br>
LFG Comic #60 and #61 are out, Dark Legacy reached its 100th comic ! The Big AT Adventure from Actiontrip is also finished and I suggest that you read it entirely (22 Pages long, the link will point to the first page, click &quot;Next part&quot; on the top of the page)<br>

You&apos;ll also notice that the blades of azzinoth are on the Actiontrip comic thumbnails ... Well, that&apos;s a pretty good timing, because Method (http://smiler.se/method/portal/) dropped the [item=32837] on their first Illidan kill. It&apos;s not the first drop but it seems that the droprate isn&apos;t that bad. (Only 13 guilds killed Illidan for the moment)</div></div>
