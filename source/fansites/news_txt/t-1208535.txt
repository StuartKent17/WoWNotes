Guide to the Golden Lotus Faction Quests
We've seen some confusion about how to gain access to the Golden Lotus faction dailies in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. In case you've been having trouble getting where you need to be, below are some detailed steps to ensure you're on the correct path.

Spoiler Warning! This guide shares some details about the associated quest chain that takes you to the Vale of Eternal Blossoms and the Golden Lotus. If you'd prefer to naturally find your way there during your adventures, the first couple of bullets should be sufficient for pointing you in the right direction.

Here is how you get into the Vale of Eternal Blossoms:

At level 87, go speak to Anduin http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/64540-anduin-wrynn/Dezco http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/64542-sunwalker-dezco at the Temple of the White Tiger in Kun-Lai Summit and complete “A Celestial Experience http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31395-a-celestial-experience.” Accept the follow-up quest, “A Witness to History http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31511-a-witness-to-history.”
Find Anduin http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/64848-anduin-wrynn/Dezco http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/64853-sunwalker-dezco at the big gate north of the Vale. This will start a cinematic that opens the gates.
Turn in “A Witness to History http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31511-a-witness-to-history” to Zhi the Harmonious http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/59905-zhi-the-harmonious at the Golden Pagoda in the center of Vale of Eternal Blossoms.
Accept and complete the follow-up quest, “The Shrine of Two Moons http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30649-the-shrine-of-two-moons,” and “The Shrine of Seven Stars http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30631-the-shrine-of-seven-stars” Horde/Alliance respectively.
If you're not level 90 you'll receive no further quests.
At level 90 you should return and pick up the quest chain again. Note that you must have trained flying to proceed.


Pick up “The Ruins of Guo-Lai http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30632-the-ruins-of-guo-lai” and complete it.
This leads to “Out with the Scouts http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30633-out-with-the-scouts” and “Barring Entry http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30634-barring-entry.” This leads to “Killing the Quilen http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30635-killing-the-quilen” and “Stones of Power http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30636-stones-of-power.” While in the ruins, you should also get “The Guo-Lai Halls http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30654-the-guo-lai-halls.” If you don't get this quest near the entrance to the crypt, you can return to Anji Autumnlight http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/58465-anji-autumnlight to get this quest.
These 3 quests must be completed before you can complete “Leaving an Opening http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30638-leaving-an-opening.” Turn in “Leaving an Opening” at the Golden Pagoda, and this should lead straight into the dailies.

If you have any questions or concerns, or if you're still experiencing issues accessing the Vale of Eternal Blossoms or the Golden Lotus daily quests, please let us know.

No Pet Battle Quests
If you're not seeing the daily quests for a continent, have you earned the Taming achievement to unlock them for that continent? Did they show up once and then never come back? not resetting Are any working at all, and if so, which ones?

Note: Taming Kalimdor is Horde only, and Taming Eastern Kingdoms is Alliance only. This was done via hotfix so the UI in-game will not update until 5.1, which is why you may see completion swap between the two. Not to worry though, the data is all there and will be resolved with the 5.1 patch.

Strong Pet Trap?
We applied a hotfix to attempt to resolve issues of not properly receiving the upgraded Strong and Pristine traps. Please let us know if you're still having the issue, what character and realm is seeing the issue, and once you received the achievement, did your trap art, tooltip or icon change to reflect an upgraded trap?

New Loot Window
you can type /loot to see who needs/greed/passes
I've done a few dungeons myself during this weekend and I've noticed that some players are simply unaware of this feature, sometimes I saw some people needing on offspec stuff because they weren't seeing any "need" rolls from other players, obviously this can lead to some arguing.

So here it is again for the sake of clarity, please type /loot, /lootrolls or you can just click on [Loot] in the chat window. 
This will open a new loot window that shows you all rolls on every item.
You can also go to Interface->Controls-> and click on “Auto Open Loot Rolls Window!” Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/239290-new-loot-system-is-not-very-effective/ / Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5575027577?page=1#7

Daily Quests and Gearing for Raids
You can get gear from heroic dungeons and in the process get 60 Valor for the first dungeon you do daily, as well as 30 Valor for the first scenario and a chance at getting loot usable by your class when finishing it. It may seem a small amount, but since both venues can be done relatively quickly, if you're aiming to cap valor points, it'll probably be the fastest way to do so without considering raiding.

If there are particular items read: gear you feel you need to get 100% from the factions in Mists of Pandaria, keep in mind that Raid Finder gear is not available yet, and neither the Heart of Fear and Terrace of Endless Spring raids. 

If even with these things taken into consideration you still feel that a particular item is required, then it might be a good idea to point it out on this thread

Assume for a minute that, the player is casual read: not alot of time to spend in game but capable, and is able to cap valor points in a given week, yet doesn't have the time to rep grind from doing the ridiculous number of dailies that are currently the main end game focus of mists until we are allowed into all raids and RF is active etc etc, with a total cap of 3k VP available per character. How then is this type of player supposed to get gear? 
Sounds like a rather edgy case, meaning, if a player is as casual as you described, it'd probably be best for that player to focus on cap his valor through dailies, so that he'll be grinding whichever reputations he wants to focus on at the same time. If he chooses instead to focus on doing heroics until he gets his gear, then after he's done with that part, he might focus on dailies.

The problem is, this case is littered with too many "ifs". For this discussion it'd probably be much more useful to know what's exactly concerning you.

Also, keep in mind that Pandaria isn't going to vanish into thin air. As long as you're progressing towards your goal, even if it takes you longer than more dedicated players, isn't that still advancing your character? Just curious.
