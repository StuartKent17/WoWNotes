Nop. The latest PvP PTR testing was made on the current build and developers were still looking for a couple of very annoying bugs. If you add it to a few random bugs like people disconnecting from the game as soon as they enter water and a few other things, I would definitely say that we will have to wait at least one more week before we see the patch on live servers.<br>

Patch 3.3.3 Pet - Lil&apos;XT and Celestial Dragon<br>
One of the latest 3.3.3 PTR build added a new pet to the game: Lil&apos; XT (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75906/lil-xt/). We don&apos;t know what the drop location is for the moment but the name is very similar to Lil&apos; KT from the Blizzard Store and the description mentions &quot;Action Figure&quot;, it might be another pet that players can get out of the game. (But not necessarily)<br>
<br>
He looks pretty cute and has a couple of unique animations + its own voice!<br>

<br>
Also, the Celestial Dragon (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75613/celestial-dragon/)&apos;s model has been updated once again, it now uses the same armor as the Celestial Steed (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KvDDFi0Fuo).<br>
