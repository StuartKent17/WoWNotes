Warlords of Draenor Survey
A survey was emailed to a small group of players that had a few interesting questions about Warlords of Draenor. via Rivenwolf 

You can find a poll http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1430853-Do-you-want-paid-boosted-90-to-be-in-game on a paid boost to 90 on the forum, as well as a poll http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1430585-Poll-Pricecheck-on-boost-to-90-feature-%28from-Blizzard-survey%29 on the acceptable price, and some discussion http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1430579-Blizzard-s-newest-venture of the questions. 


The survey asked about pricing Warlords of Draenor at $39 or $49 with the boost of a character to level 90.
It also asked about pricing Warlords of Draenor at $39 without boost of a character to level 90.
Another question asked what a fair price for the level 90 boost would be. 

Keep in mind that as it was described at Blizzcon, you might be able to purchase a copy of Warlords of Draenor and WoW, then get the free level 90 and transfer that character to your main WoW account, which would allow the purchase of level 90 characters in a roundabout way. 
The Blizzcon Q&A mentioned that the team has talked about putting a level 90 purchase option in the store.

Players were also asked if they had purchased the Annual Pass for Diablo 3 and if they would purchase an annual pass now.

I would love to see weapon skills removed altogether. This far into the game lore cannot support the selectivity
There are significant gameplay reasons for weapon skills, not just lore. For example, loot distribution, among others. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416687537592082432
Fair enough, will there be at least more options for hybrids then? At the moment boomkin gets stuck with spirit mace.
How do you figure? Moonkins can also use Staves and Daggers, plus the occasional oddity. They have a fair array of options. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416721467825344512
Being pessimistic about options in WoD, Maces seemed geared for healers in MoP, wouldn't mind seeing my moonkin with a sword :P
Swords and Druids don't really mix. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416722793846153217
Aye can understand that, how about seeing more 2H maces that aren't down to even more random chances then usual in WoD?
Not sure what you mean; what does randomness have to do with weapon type? Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416723186718216192

Is there interest in letting a spellcast finish instantly if that spell procs while casting or is that another mechanic entirely
Can you give an example of what you're talking about? I don't understand... Do you mean like Lava Surge or Shooting Stars? Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/415231218678910976
Like Lava Surge, yeah. You start casting Lava Burst without Lava Surge buff ofc, Lava Surge then procs, Lava Burst fires.
Typically, in that sort of case, we do even better: you finish that cast, then can cast another instant one immediately after. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/415232454597697536
We can't always be that generous, due to burst concerns, but we balance around however we choose to do it. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/415232626031484928

Why are WW Monks the ONLY tank hybrid without access to their tank stance/presence/seal? With 0 Passive defenses + leather armor
Sparring was supposed to help there, but I agree that it's a bit lackluster. Want them more like rogues in their tanking abilities. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417043621787885569
As opposed to an Arms Warrior's, for example Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417043715228577792
Similar problem but admittedly not as bad with DPS DKs not getting their taunt ability.
They get Death Grip. We don't want to give DPS DKs two Taunts, and I'm sure that most would prefer the utility of DGrip. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417188913774489600

Will we ever see fist weapons show up on monks while fighting? That or ability to x-mog into something that does show up.
Intentional hard-coded kit is to only use weapons occasionally. Not sure what it'd take to change, even if class peeps wanted to! Source https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/416632694072565761
would like another attack to show weapons. Maybe a talent choice.
Fist weapons specifically, we want to show more. We're working on that, but no promises when we'll get to do it. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416737807344746496
Would love a glyph to display weapons in all Monk attacks Tiger Palm -> Tiger Strike etc.
I want a glyph that lets my hunter throw buzzsaws instead of nelf shuriken. Wait. Why didn't I do that?! Source https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/417011614756245505

Any chance on HPriest mastery being relooked at for WoD? Maybe turn all the overheals from it into something?
Echo of Light us something we balance assuming it's going to be more overheal than average. More of regen than healing in design. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414224697778135040
It's not really a choice when it maths out to be 25% or less of the value of other secondaries in typical 25H.
That only sounds accurate when significantly overhealing, and only if your goal is topping the healing meters. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414540027998117889
If you're not overhealing, and your goal is minimizing deaths, mastery can work well. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414540234718576640
And when in the last 3 expacs has there not been significant overhealing most of the time even progression?
I'm referring to using more healers than you need. Doing so results in RShams looking weak, and Discs strong. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414607390848188416

Art
Hide gloves and shoulders, will it be available in WoD or maybe a cosmetic item to make them invisible?
out of curiosity, why would you want to hide those specific items? Source https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/410513044003753984

Is there anyway we can get a "hide weapon enchant" option ever put into the game? They kinda destroy my xmog half the time 
It's been tossed around. We've floated the idea of enchant xmog too. But don't want to devalue the enchant either. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/412835346028564480

will there ever be a "show shoulder" button in the interface options like there is for cloak and helm? 
we've been talking a lot about this lately, would love to implement a more robust show/hide system for customization Source https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/415205815880937472

Warlords of Draenor Stats
You number-squished down to Wrath-ish levels; why not go to Classic or lower, more room for expansion?
We are. 1-60 was linear, 60-90 exponential. We're extending that linear climb higher still deciding where, likely to 85. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410889824296398848

Haste only feels good to classes that truly benefit from it though. Can it be +Amp instead? Anything else really.
"Classes that truly benefit from Haste" means... Everyone except Warriors. And we're going to fix that. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409046046480691200

Question: How is Haste going to interact with DoTs in Warlords if they're dynamic? Can't add bonus ticks on the fly, right?
Duration doesn't change with haste; no new ticks. Time until next tick recalculated on each tick. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414226148361396226
Err, clarification: no new whole ticks needed to be added/removed. Partial ticks at the end are used to make it smooth. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414226573303107586

... Also, semi-related Q: why does the caster haste buff give spell haste instead of casting speed like the melee one does?
Related to both of these questions, we're planning to try to improve the simplicity of the various haste and haste-like effects. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417386238799138816

because haste is only valuable up to a point and then falls behind. feels limiting when u waste so much haste after GCD cap
Intended for stats to be close in value. Going to work on GCD capping issues in WoD. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409168227873193984
How much do you think removing reforging and increasing # of secondary stats will help w/GCD cap issues? More need to be done?
It may help some; stats will be more spread out on average. Its impact is likely to vary significantly by spec. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409910223923462144
Lowering it would have weird effects. The more buttons you press, the more internet latency hurts you.
Yeah, we try not to go below 1sec GCDs in all but the most extreme circumstances. Hurts high latency players. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409897362442555392

PvP
Providing more rewards for "undesirable" battlegrounds could work. Interesting idea. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/410986401472065536

Does PvP power boost my healing spells when I'm healing at world bosses? Does it count as outdoors healing?
Where it works would follow the same rules as now which is it would work in the outdoor world. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/410471964403183616

I'm guessing most teams had 3 members and now lots of ppl play with more than 2 partners...This makes it alot easier to climb the ladders on multiple chars...
# of players captures more people that played very few games in a way # of teams did not. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413084846152351744
The number of people that play a handful of games is quite high. Totally different problem though Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413084964775665664
So basicly it's a 'fake' enormous increase in participation, sort of. That fix should be fine.
The participation number I quoted +25% is based on number of WoW accounts that have done arena. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413086969397137408
The # of gladiators increase is due to how things changed with teams. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413087727085572097
I know players use glad count as an indicator for participation, but 5.4 changed that metric. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413088066325082112

but don't titles require players to have more than 50 games won in that bracket?
Yes receiving a title has that requirement. Being considered a "participant" doesn't. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413087637247778817

Instead of everyone counting towards the % towards titles how about people above 1000 rating count to that % only? Thoughts? =
It will be something along those lines. Will announce the rating after more analysis. 1000 is a good guess ;- but no promise. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417153059353927681

Any update to let us know if anything will change about arena title cut-offs?Or is % the same despite insanely low cut-offs?
You can expect the number of Gladiators to be in the same ballpark as before taking into account 3v3 participation is up +25% Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413031186991034368
When you mean before, you surely mean last season before, not TBC before when PvP was enjoyed by more players than now.
I remember people complaining in TBC. I remember people complaining in Wrath. I remember people complaining in Cata. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413085625546321920
We will use a minimum rating for a player to count against the pool when calculating titles. More info towards end of season. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413031522254716929
This is stupid. That could potentially decrease participation, why change something that has always been like that.
It was based on # of arena teams not # of players. This is the first season with no teams. There is no precedent. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413043851440295936


10 Death Knight Heroic Throne of Thunder
This time around 10 Death Knights were able to clear Heroic Throne of Thunder. It will be interesting to see how well they fare against current content when raids are cross realm in Warlords of Draenor!
