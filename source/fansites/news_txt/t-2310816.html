Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
BlizzCon draws near, and we wanted to give you an update about Diablo&#x2019;s presence at the show. Last year at BlizzCon, we kicked off Diablo&#x2019;s 20th anniversary by announcing the old-school cathedral dungeon (if you missed that the first time around, it&#x2019;s coming back in January) and unveiling Rise of the Necromancer. This year, we want to give you a heads-up that while Diablo will be on the show floor, we won&#x2019;t be making any new Diablo announcements. There will be a time for that at some point in the future, but that time is not now.<br>
<br>
However, in addition to the special BlizzCon Diablo III in-game reward, we&#x2019;ll also have Diablo panels for attendees and Virtual Ticket holders, and, as always, we look forward to a weekend filled with fun and revelry with the heroes who call Sanctuary home.<br>
<br>
Patch 2.6.1 is on the horizon. Looking beyond that, we&#x2019;re hard at work on the future of Diablo and exploring what&#x2019;s next for the franchise. Please be patient. Our passion for Sanctuary burns as bright as the High Heavens and as hot as the Burning Hells&#x2014;and we&#x2019;re excited to hunker down and get working!<br>
<br>
Until next time,<br>
The Diablo Development Team<br>

In Remembrance: The Harvest Festival Has Arrived<br>
The yearly Harvest Festival is now underway in Azeroth. This is a solemn time when the Alliance honors Uther the Lightbringer by lighting a candle at his tomb in the Western Plaguelands, while members of the Horde show their respect to Grommash Hellscream by leaving a bottle of spirits at the base of the Hellscream Memorial in Demon Fall Canyon in Ashenvale.<br>
<br>
To commemorate those who have sacrificed their lives to help friends and allies, feasts are also held outside Ironforge and Orgrimmar in honor of these fallen heroes.<br>
<br>
When: September 29&#x2013;October 6<br>
<br>
Where: Outside of Ironforge and Orgrimmar<br>
<br>
This year, worgen, goblin, and pandaren now have unique tributes available to them in the quest, &#x201C;Honoring a Hero.&#x201D; All Harvest Festival foods also provide 4% health per tick.<br>

Shadowcaster Voruun<br>
Hey all,<br>
<br>
I have some answers on this now - Shadowcaster Voruun will spawn like all other Argus rares - i.e. he has a chance of being a daily World Quest, and he can also spawn as a rare every time the Argus rares cycle (every four hours).<br>
<br>
What we resolved with Voruun was an issue that was preventing him from spawning in general, and, now that that is resolved, he will definitely be making appearances in the future. Just to stress this - while he may not be up immediately, he should now be spawning much, much more often going forward.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all of your patience while we got this sorted out today! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1073310-shadowcaster-voruun-spawn-times/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759376437?page=17#328))<br>

Human and Blood Elf Shaman<br>
I don&apos;t think it&apos;s about their culture not being &quot;primitive&quot;, it&apos;s more that when you play a Human or a Blood Elf, or any other race for that matter, your character comes from a specific &quot;faction&quot; within that race. This lends them the ability to choose what they want to &quot;be&quot; when they grow up, but only insofar as what that particular society offers.<br>
<br>
Playable Humans are always from the nation of Stormwind. Playable Blood Elves are always from Silvermoon. While it&apos;s possible for there to be &quot;break aways&quot; in the story and for members of those races to join &quot;opposing factions&quot; and learn new skills, that&apos;s not something that&apos;s on offer to player characters.<br>
<br>
If those classes were ever added to those races, I would expect specific backstory to be created for how those races adopted those techniques and rituals, such as with gnome hunters &quot;creating&quot; and taming mechanical beasts.
