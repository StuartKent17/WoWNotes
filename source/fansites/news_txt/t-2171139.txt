Legendary Drop Rates
The rate at which players acquire Legendary items is a subject that we’ve kept a very close eye on since the launch of Legion. We’ve generally tried to avoid getting into too much technical detail on the system behind your chance to get a Legendary, but we would like to say a bit more on what we’ve done behind-the-scenes up to this point.

As many players have figured out, changes were made to legendary drop rates with patch 7.1 and patch 7.1.5 – when those patches went live, your chance to receive a Legendary increased in pretty much all cases. What you might not have noticed is that we’ve been steadily increasing your chances since then. One of our long-term goals is to allow you to switch specific Legendary items in and out as the situation warrants, and regularly increasing drop chances is one way of ensuring that that happens.

We’ve also made adjustments that leveled off what used to be steady decrease to your chance to get subsequent Legendaries after your first. When Legion launched, every time you earned a Legendary, your starting chance to earn your next one would be lower and thus, the average time it took you to loot it would be longer. At this stage, however, most players in the Broken Isles are no longer hunting for their first Legendary, and many already have their second. We didn’t want you to feel as though your good fortune in the past equates to harder times in the future, so we normalized drop chances for subsequent Legendaries after your second. Right now, in Patch 7.1.5, your first Legendary has the highest drop chance, the second still has a significant bonus, and then you’ll have the same chances to earn your third Legendary as you will your fourth, fifth, sixth, and so on.

We think it’s important to get this across clearly: it currently takes the same amount of luck/effort to get your third Legendary as it takes to get your eighth. We’ve seen a few players and tools attempting to use historical data to predict their drop chances, but because of how regularly we’ve been increasing Legendary drop rates, that data is extremely outdated – and their conclusions extremely inaccurate. In short, your chance of receiving that next Legendary is probably a lot better than you think.

Ending Support for Windows XP and Vista
Starting later this year, we will begin the process of ending support for Windows XP and Windows Vista in World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, Diablo III, Hearthstone, and Heroes of the Storm. Microsoft ceased mainstream support for these versions of Windows in 2009 and 2012, respectively, but since a decent portion of our audience was still using them at the time, we continued supporting them. However, there have been three major Windows releases since Vista, and at this point, the vast majority of our audience has upgraded to one of the newer versions.

After these older operating systems are no longer supported, the games will not run on them, so we encourage any players who are still using one of the older OSes to upgrade to a newer version. We’ll be rolling out this change on a staggered schedule, and will post further notices as we get closer to making the change for each game.

Patch 7.2 - New Artifact Traits
The new traits that are replacing the 20-point trait on PTR e.g. Instability of the Tirisgarde http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/241124-instability-of-the-tirisgarde  will affect all damage, including for specs that didn't get that benefit from the previous version. That still leaves the initial 5% 35-point trait that still exists, but that's no more than a 5% swing in the value of trinkets.

Arcane T20 set bonus
We're considering making the set bonus work with some spell other than Greater Invisibility, to avoid overloading a utility button with a rotational DPS benefit.

PvP
Battleground matchmaking has been region wide for awhile, not battlegroups. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/830332989116518400
In each region, one faction does tend to have more people queuing than the other. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/830333198198386688
e,g, NA tends to have more Horde, EU tends to have more Alliance. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/830333501475999745
Alliance vs Horde in BGs super important. Striving to keep it and get better balance. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/830333975524630528
how?
We now reward end of season titles Gladiator, etc to top % of each faction. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/830338102447071232
Over time many seasons hope to see top players spread between both factions. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/830338212417593346
Incentivize players on less represented faction to play more. https://t.co/K73XuI2Gv2 holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/830338458719707136
surely that just fills the ranks with more casual players?
Not necessarily. Works for Mercenaries too. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/830339966836224000
