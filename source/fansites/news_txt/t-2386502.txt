PvP Hotfixes
People on the arena forums are stating the Demonic PvP tabard was just hotfixed and replaced with the same one used in the Ferocious season. The Demonic one was complained about because it looked so bad. From what I can tell so far these reports are true.

Why would that be hotfixed but not the Elite sets? They are both items on the exact same vendor.
Hey guys! This is a bit off-topic for this thread and is a separate issue. It was identified this morning that the previous Demonic Tabard and Cloak didn't look demonic enough so the Ferocious ones were recolored and changed to be the new appearances. Thus looking far more Demonic to match the name.

When you're comparing these things I would suggest looking at the kind of change it is to realize how they're different. For example, an art related change and a change related to adding an item attached to season ratings are very different changes that have different steps to alter them, especially when needing to use the in-game rating systems to verify who can obtain seasonal items from PVP. 

I know its frustrating to still not have something you've earned but like I previously stated we have the intention to give this to you guys sooner rather than later. I'm still continually reading the thread and have upped the cap again, as soon as I know more information I'll share it when I can.


Battle for Azeroth - PvP Talents
PvP talents are not yet enabled on Alpha servers, and more information will be available once we move into more focused PvP testing. Don't worry though, players will have an opportunity to use PvP talents while leveling in Battle for Azeroth!

Honorable Medallion is still granted to all characters once they enter PvP for the first time. We're also planning on unlocking access to PvP talents at a much lower level than in Legion.
