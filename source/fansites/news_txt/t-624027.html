As we have mentioned, we are discussing some exciting changes to how soul shards might work. This is not an announcement of an overhaul to that system, but it will make shard use slightly less painful.<br>
<br>
When a warlock casts Ritual of Summoning, instead of creating a portal, they will summon a new creation similar to a dungeon meeting stone. It will cost one shard to create this item. Then, anyone in the warlock&#x2019;s party or raid can use the &#x201C;meeting stone&#x201D; to summon other members of the group. For example, once the warlock summons the stone, then party members B and C could summon D without the warlock&#x2019;s direct involvement, and most importantly without requiring additional shards. You will be able to bring the rest of a 25-person raid quickly (since you can summon folks simultaneously), for the cost of a single shard, and with less clicking on the part of the lock.<br>
<br>
The &#x201C;meeting stone&#x201D; will last 5 minutes with a 5 minute cooldown. It will not be usable in areas where summoning is currently restricted, such as battlegrounds or in combat. Creating the stone still requires 2 people in addition to the warlock. Summoning actual party members only requires 2 people.<br>
<br>
This change will be in for the next patch, which will occur before the 3.1 Ulduar content patch.</div></div>
