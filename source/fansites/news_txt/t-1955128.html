[Feedback] Guardian<br>
Basically I love the aesthetics and overall design motif for Guardians in legion. But I really don&apos;t love the ability rotation. Unbelievably simple, no choice, no optional complexity, and almost impossible to execute incorrectly.<br>
<br>
I can&apos;t imagine pressing X -&gt; Lacerate for 6-8 minutes on a boss. I would be unbelievably bored.<br>
We&apos;ll likely tweak those talents now that Thrash (Lacerate) stacks take longer to apply. Exact details still TBD. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/401781-feedback-guardian/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20419283872?page=6#112))<br>

Balance Affinity - Moonkin Form (21154)<br>
As of Build 21154, Moonkin form granted by the talent Balance Affinity does not currently enable the usage of Starsurge or Lunar strike.<br>

[Feedback] Mistweaver<br>
Essence Font, as mentioned, should already not be too weak (roughly matching Vivify) when there are 5 targets to heal. But that might not be enough to make it interesting in a 5-player setting--we can move some healing from the HoT to the initial heal to shore it up there. It&apos;s possible the HoT causes the spell&apos;s use to be poorly messaged, even though it&apos;s quite a large heal on 5-6 targets (the aforementioned change would make it closely comparable to Wild Growth). If tinkering with the numbers doesn&apos;t succeed in making its usage intuitive, a cooldown is an option in lieu of the HoT--but that would reduce its flexibility, and the current advantage it has on large numbers of targets (and its uniqueness as well).<br>
<br>
While there&apos;s been a lot of positive feedback on Rising Thunder, I&apos;ve seen a lot of intimations that it&apos;s overpowered (usual caveat that tuning should not be the foremost concern at this stage regardless). I&apos;m curious if this is based on evaluations of the talent that are 1) in the absence of artifact traits affecting Thunder Focus Tea, 2) after the nerf to Renewing Mist, and 3) taking into account the mana cost of Rising Sun Kick. Any theorycraft on RT in those conditions would likely by the most useful.<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen much theorycrafting on RT without the TFT traits. Typically when most of us talk about things it&apos;s either all traits we can access or none of them, and on this build you can have both Dancing Mists and Harmony and Focus which enables a kind of silly ReM spam that in turns allows a ton of buffed Vivifies. These aren&apos;t really relevant in playtesting because 5 mans don&apos;t have enough people for those ReMs to add extra targets.<br>
Right, sorry, &quot;without the TFT traits&quot; meant &quot;without any traits&quot; would be fine too. Just want to isolate discussion about RT from the interactions with Celestial Breath and Focus and Harmony.<br>
<br>
Rising Thunder is overpowered in a talent-selection sense that it blows Focused Thunder out of the water (one extra TFT&apos;d spell per 30 seconds or an extra TFT spell even before artifacts.. basically whenever the hell you want) as well as Mana Tea (mana savings of TFT-Vivify).<br>
That&apos;s the question--does it so obviously dominate Focused Thunder, when it&apos;s the gain of 1 TFT buff every 30s, at the cost of 3 GCDs, a nontrivial amount of mana, and a range requirement.

Holy Priest Synergy with Holy Word<br>
I would say our biggest difference philosophically is that we&apos;re not so sanguine about the state of Holy on live, which relies on using Renew to drive Sanctuary, to the exclusion of most other modes of healing. For one, it does not seem especially versatile or varied--most of the synergies/rewards (more CoH casts and more WoM procs) are relatively passive/smart effects with little player interaction, simply results of casting as many Renews as possible. Also, a heavily Renew-oriented rotation is not very appropriate for Holy (essentially, their gameplay should not be so similar to Resto Druid), and it&apos;s intentional that the direct heals are more in the forefront in Legion. Renew is available as a reasonable option when an instant or slow top-off is convenient, but is not positioned to be a primary workhorse of the class.<br>
<br>
Heal and Flash Heal are somewhat on the strong end of analogous spells across the healing classes. It is possible that buffing them in terms of cost, instead of buffing their heal size as we recently did, would help the rotation flow more smoothly. While Holy Priests do have to get used to a more mana-limited world on alpha like everyone does, being able to fill with the basic heals consistently is intended. Similarly, PoH did suffer a loss in some situations from its targeting change (which we felt was necessary), and we&apos;ll keep an eye on it. There&apos;s some concern that it could get too attractive or self-working to spam in raids, since it does use smart targeting now.<br>
<br>
More generally across all healers, the pace of healing spell use is intentionally being slowed down from the current world of overly abundant mana (as has been discussed elsewhere), so you may have to realign your expectations somewhat of how frequently you can use expensive heals or large heals. Especially so in the context of Holy Words, which justify their unusual strength by having cooldowns that are meaningfully long. It should not feel anything like the regularity with which you press CoH in Warlords--you should expect to typically have situations where a Holy Word is not available and won&apos;t be available in time to solve the healing need that&apos;s presently at hand.

[Feedback] Demonology Warlock<br>
A heads-up for Demonology Warlocks about a change you&apos;ll see in today&apos;s build:<br>
<br>
Summon Inquisitor was changed into Summon Dreadlord. We&apos;ve been exploring different options for what demon for this talent to summon, and it happened to be on Dreadlord when this build was made.<br>
<br>
However, internally, it has already changed again, and in the next build, you&apos;ll find that it has become Summon Beholder, which shoots Eye Lasers. Please base feedback on that, instead of the briefly-lived Dreadlord. Thanks!<br>
<br>
RIP Dreadlord. But shouldn&apos;t we already have Beholder via the Supremacy glyph to Felhunter?<br>
That&apos;s what we call the &quot;Observer&quot;. The &quot;Beholder&quot; in this case is a demon you&apos;ve seen very rarely, most notably Durumu.
