This is now official, Worgens won't get their own mounts, they will get a mount racial spell instead.

Running Wild http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/87840/running-wild/ - Drop to all fours to run as fast as a wild animal.

Running Wild is indeed the new racial "mount" for worgen. Functionally the ability works exactly like a mount. This does mean the worgen are not bringing faction mounts to the table which other Alliance races can access. This is also of course very different from the original Plainsrunning implemented for taurens. We have no plans to try and bring that ability back in any form.

Ultimately, we feel Running Wild fits very well with the nature of the worgen race. Rather than getting a physical mount, they get down and sprint on all fours. When you're playing a worgen, it just feels awesome. :
