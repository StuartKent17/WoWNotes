Pilgrim's Bounty
The Pilgrim’s Bounty  is coming up from November 20 to November 27 and with it comes a time to reflect upon one’s good fortune and share feasts with everyone around you!


 


New in 2017
With the introduction of the Appearance tab in 7.0, the non-transmoggable Pilgrim set can be saved and transmogged during the duration of the holiday.


 


The Spirit of Sharing
The main area where the festivities take place is right outside the capital cities for the Horde and Alliance and in a couple of smaller towns.


Players can interact with the many foods options set on these tables and will gain a buff by eating or passing each of the servings. 
There are 5 buffs in total that you can gain that when combined together will reward the The Spirit of Sharing  buff that grants 10% increase in reputation gains for one hour. This is great if you are working on Legion reputations and completing World Quests or working on other reputations for a little boost. 



 


Cooking
Pilgrim’s Bounty is centered around cooking and there are 5 recipes to add to your cooking collection. All you need to do is buy the Bountiful Cookbook  from Bountiful Barrel  located at each capital city table to learn them. The recipes are used for several quests, dailies, and the Now We’re Cookin’  achievement related to the holiday.


 


Spice Bread Stuffing 
Pumpkin Pie 
Cranberry Chutney 
Candied Sweet Potato 
Slow-Roasted Turkey 



Cosmetic Items
5 daily quests can be found around the bountiful tables at capital cities that award a piece of a non-transmoggable Pilgrim’s set or a Pilgrim's Bounty  cache. 


The cache can contain the Fine Pilgrim's Hat , the Frightened Bush Chicken  battle pet and the Silver-Plated Turkey Shooter  toy, along with several consumable foods and turkey shooters. 
The quests are centered around cooking so having at least a 280 skill level will help but if you do not have the skill level, you can buy the items needed from Bountiful Barrel  at each capital city table.

Blue Tweets
So, remind me how "viable" non Warrior tanks were in Vanilla? ie: Bear Druids & Prot Paladins.
Speaking as someone who did it: Less viable than Warriors. More viable than people thought. Celestalon 
By today's forum standards, obviously 100% nonviable and useless, so it does sort of depend on what you're asking.
I remember a video of a bear Hugehoss tanking Garr + all of his adds. Was quite the inspiration! Celestalon 
partially gear dependent - some of which you couldn't acquire until BWL either
Bears in Vanilla were hiiiighly gear-dependent, and in odd ways. Scaled extreeeemely well with Bonus Armor, which was super rare. Celestalon 
So the best gearset commonly included a lvl 43 world drop epic, shoulders from Sunken Temple, rings from a Tanaris quest and MC drop, etc. Celestalon 

with the new raid opening on Nov.28th should we expect the difficulty of mythic + to increase or remain the same?
Consistent with NH/ToS opening, you'll see the reward ceiling go up to M15 when Mythic Antorus opens. Dungeon difficulty won't change.WatcherDev 


Build of the Month - November 2017
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

All of the parts on this page are Amazon affiliate links. When you purchase your parts through them it helps support the site!


This month
New CPUs from Intel have been released but are proving challenging to actually find in stock. They will require a new motherboard as well. We will update our build list with the 8600K  and other Coffee Lake CPUs when stock improves. If you can find an 8600K  in stock, be sure to use a Z370 motherboard , as older motherboards are not compatible even though they have the same pin count.

The current SSD prices  are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale.

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 7700K and would get more performance from spending that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions!
