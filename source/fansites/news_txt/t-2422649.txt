What to do at Level 120
Raids, Warfronts, a new PvP season, and world bosses are still a couple weeks out, but there is plenty to do to get ready while you wait!

Gearing Up

You can purchase an item level 320 cloak  from any reputation vendor that you have earned honored status with in Battle for Azeroth.
Normal mode dungeons !#bfadungeons at level 120 reward item level 310 gear.
You need an item level of 305 to queue for heroic dungeons. You can bypass this by creating a 5 man group and zoning in manually. Heroic dungeons reward item level 325 gear.
Mythic 0 dungeons are available. Make sure you complete all 10 dungeons weekly. They reward item level 340+ gear.


World Quests

To unlock world quests you must reach Level 120 and complete the quest Uniting Kul Tiras  A or Uniting Zandalar  H. This means that you must also have completed the War Campaign quests up this point, which involves doing all three war campaign foothold quests in the zones on the opposite continent.

If you have not reached Friendly with the required factions !#reputations, continue questing for the reputation.
Your emissaries can reward Azerite Armor and other useful gear up to item level 340.
Increasing your item level also increases your world quest rewards item level. The general rule of thumb is every 10 item levels you have increases the rewards to your item level + 10 to a max of 340 at item level 330.



Reputations

Champions of Azeroth  is the most important reputation. Every rank up in reputation rewards your Heart of Azeroth with 15 item levels. Upon reaching Exalted you can also purchase a piece of item level 355 Azerite Armor. See our Champions of Azeroth Reputation Guide  for more information.

Purchase or make if you are a Scribe a Contract: Champions of Azeroth  as soon as possible. This rewards 10 reputation for the Champions of Azeroth when completing any world quest in Battle for Azeroth zones.

Prioritize 7th Legion   reputation as well by completing world quests on the enemy continent. This reputation is needed for a variety of different unlocks.

You need 7,500 reputation into Honored to unlock one of the final 2 Mythic only dungeons Siege of Boralus  or Kings' Rest , depending on your faction.
You need to reach Revered in order to finish the War Campaign.
You need to reach Exalted to unlock the Dark Iron Dwarves or Mag'har Orc Allied races. depending on faction

All other reputations are also important. They each have a piece of item level 335 gear at Revered  and a piece of item level 355 gear at Exalted 


Azerite Power Farming

Don't forget to farm Azerite Power for your Heart of Azeroth. Every rank up increases the item level of the neck piece by 2 and can unlock new Azerite powers in your Azerite Armor slots.

Make sure to max out your weekly Island Expeditions bar by collecting 40,000 Azerite during Island Expeditions over the week. This rewards 2,500 Azerite power and 1500 7th Legion   reputation.
Heroic dungeons are another source of Azerite power farming.
