<br>
MMO-Champion is recruiting forum moderators!<br>
I am looking for moderators. A lot of moderators. If you check the forums regularly you probably saw a few change happens and more things are on my lists.<br>
<br>
That&apos;s why more moderators are needed, the forums aren&apos;t necessarily the happiest place on earth at the moment and the curent team of super-awesome moderators (who have to take care of 3 to 5000 posts each day) would be happy to have new friends. <br>
<br>
Are you interested? Please <br>
send me a mail (boubouille@mmo-champion.com?subject=[Moderator] Your-Username-Goes-Here) (and only a mail, no private messages) with the following details :<br>
<br>
Your account name on the forums. Please use [Moderator] &quot;Username&quot; for the title of your mail.<br>
Real life info. (Age / Location mostly, we don&apos;t need to know much more than that) <br>
A few words on why you want to be a moderator.<br>
The name of the forum you want to moderate. (Up to 2 forums, you will only be recruited for one and the 2nd choice will be used if we have too many applications for the first one) <br>
<br>
Important - You cannot apply if you registered less than a month ago or if you have less than 100 posts on the forums. I might accept people who have slightly less than that if they look like awesome potential moderators but your post history is the only thing we can use to make a decision. <br>
<br>

Skipping to the last boss in Heroics<br>
While there may be some instances in which you can do this manually, our intention wasn&apos;t to make this an exceedingly quick way to get two Emblems of Frost. This is more of a method to encourage players to participate in the Looking for Group system and help those who are playing through the dungeons get ready for the epic encounters that await them in our currently available raid content. Thus, implementing a &quot;skip to the finale boss&quot; mechanism would be counter to those goals.

<br>
Resilience Boost Hotfix<br>
We don&apos;t want resilience per se to bring with it the &quot;kiss / curse&quot; of also nerfing your own healing output or heals received. We want players to like resilience on PvP gear. It shouldn&apos;t be a hard decision. We&apos;d prefer a model where resilience improves your survivability without any real downside.<br>
<br>
If we implement a healing change, it would be temporary because health pools will be larger in Cataclysm, proportionate to healing, so we don&apos;t think that will be a problem. Burst damage may be less of a problem too for the same reason, but we&apos;re less confident of that. If it isn&apos;t a problem, then we can change the resilience scaling again.

<br>
Rated Battlegrounds<br>
We have announced our plans to add a rating system to the Battlegrounds to bring back much better rewards and premade teams for Cataclysm. This is a system that has been under development for quite some time, and development will continue on it until we get it right. Adding this type of system into the game isn&apos;t trivial. We want to make sure Battlegrounds provide new levels of competition, properly measure success, and adequately award players according to their performance.<br>
<br>
We&apos;ll be sharing more about this system as we get further along in development of the next expansion. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22748815416-pvp-is-dying-alive-do-you-even-care.html))<br>

Blood Queen Lana&apos;thel Videos<br>
The first video of Blood Queen Lana&apos;thel I posted wasn&apos;t complete and some people couldn&apos;t see it because of the restrictions on copyrighted music. Here is a new one! <br>

<br>
Another video was also released, this one explains an ... interesting way to complete the encounter in 10-man. It doesn&apos;t really use any bug so let&apos;s just call it clever use of game mechanics.<br>
