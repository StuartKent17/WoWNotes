Strategy

 

These are the tactics that Paragon used on their first Lich King kill 26.3.2010. That week we had the 5% increased healing/health/damage buff active. Patch 3.3.3 had come out on previous Wednesday. The patch provided dps buffs to some classes like frost death knight and moonkin as well as it buffed priest shields and gave the 5% damage bonus to pets.

Basic stats on the encounter:
Lich King: 103,9M hitpoints dies at 10%
Valâ€™kyr Shadowguards: 3M hitpoints
Raging Spirits: 4,1M hitpoints
Vile Spirits: blew these up

The fight has 3 different phases and 2 transition phases + Frostmourne room in the last phase.
