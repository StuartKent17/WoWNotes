#543 - Huntmaster %n, No doubt your adventures in new lands Huntmaster $n, No doubt your adventures keep you very busy, but a matter has arisen at the Trueshot Lodge that I fear requires someone of your unique expertise. I hope you will meet me at the hunter's hall with all available haste. A dear friend of mine is in danger! For the sake of discretion, I will meet you in the harbor of the city you've been frequenting. A change of scenery should do me good! Cordially yours, Death Hunter Moorgoth P.S. I am much less fixated on death these days, but everyone knows my title, and such things are difficult to shake once established. I'm certain you understand.
