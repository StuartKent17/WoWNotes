First, we hired Bob. Who is he ? He will be the supermodel of the site and he spent the last two days working hard to give you a nice overview of all the armor sets currently available. We love you Bob !<br>

<br>
Server/Website<br>
We also moved the website to a new server, and we should have enough power to handle millions of people. You can finally invite all your friends here !<br>
<br>
Thottbot is currently updating their item tooltips to add % infos for each rating, it&apos;s nice but it&apos;s messing OUR tooltips a bit, so if you see a few funky colors on your item bonuses, we&apos;re aware of the problem and it should be fixed ... soon. <br>
<br>
IRC<br>
For those of you who are interested, I also created #mmo-champion on irc.quakenet.org. I will personally hug the first 20 people who will join.</div></div>
