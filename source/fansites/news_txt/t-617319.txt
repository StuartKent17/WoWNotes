Premade level 80 PvP characters are now available on european WotLK beta servers. There isn't any new server like what we saw in the US and they're directly transferred to Coldarra. All classes and all races are available.

At the moment, it looks like it's fairly hard to reach it by click the character copy link from the account page, but using a direct link to the premade character copy works just fine.
Go to   and login just like you do all the time
Then click  
Boom, premades !
