Celebrate your legacy with two new Heritage Armor sets—one for Blood Elves and one for dwarves—coming in the release of the Tides of Vengeance content update.


  

  

Players with maximum-level 120 blood elves or dwarves who are Exalted with their faction Silvermoon City or Ironforge respectively will be able to embark on a new quest line for each race to learn more about their history. Once you complete your quest, you’ll gain a new Heritage Armor transmog set unique to your race and be able to show off your pride.

Begin your journey by visiting the embassy in Orgrimmar or Stormwind after Tides of Vengeance arrives on December 12.
