Boubouille2010-05-03, 09:52 PMUpdate - Zarhym confirmed the F&F Alpha. 

Cataclysm Friends & Family Alpha
The Cataclysm Friends & Family Alpha just started. The banner below was taken from the official site where people eligible for the alpha can already copy their character  Let's roll. 

Important: The Friends & Family Alpha is restricted to employee's friends and family, the only way to enter this phase of the alpha is to have a Blizzard employee request a key for you personally. Any mail you receive about a potential Cataclysm beta is a scam. 


Yes, we can confirm that the Family & Friends phase of the testing process for World of Warcraft: Cataclysm has begun. The closed beta test phase has not yet started, but we will provide updated information when it does.
