Diablo III Items<br>
The official site (http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/) has been updated once again with item listings. Blizzard also recently mentioned (http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/09/21/blizzards-diablo-3-experiments-%E2%80%9Coh-this-feels-even-better-with-direct-control%E2%80%9D/) that they like how the game plays with a console controller and are still thinking about a future release on consoles. <br>

Mine of WorldCraft<br>
Mine of WorldCraft (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J_q5bf9oog) merges many people&apos;s favorite games together, World of Warcraft and Minecraft. Hopefully that doesn&apos;t include creepers! The author also has a couple of other games in his Minecraft Mashups (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/961151-Minecraft-Mashups) thread. <br>
