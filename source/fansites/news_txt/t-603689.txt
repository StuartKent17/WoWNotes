Boubouille2007-12-07, 07:35 AMWrath of the Lich King : Blizzard needs you !
Well, Blizzard doesn't really need you, but they'd be very happy to hear your feedback on your class. Both european and american community managers started topics in each class forums to ask players their view on their classes and how they would like to see it improved in the expansion. 
We're currently gathering class feedback from players for Wrath of the Lich King concerning thoughts on the areas of each class that is perceived to be most in need of improvement. This thread is not intended for discussion purposes and we ask that you please review the below format before presenting your feedback. It's very important for us to be able to review all provided feedback and as a result, not following the required format will very likely result in your post being removed.

Blue posts
A few noteworthy blue posts today, it seems that they had to remove the useful Vendors in boats and zeppelins, there isn't any official reason but we can assume it's because of a very important bug or exploit.
Transporation Vendors Removal
The vendors on the Boats and Zeppelins throughout Azeroth have run out stock and shut up shop, they are no longer able to service you with their wares. Source http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=1905770654&postId=19052191740&sid=1#0

BG Daily quest display issue
There is a known issue where re-logging after completing the daily battleground quest will result in your honour estimation displaying incorrectly.

Death Knights
No final decision has been made on whether ther will be an additional slot or not to let people create a Death Knight character. For the moment it looks like people will have to delete one of their character if they don't have any slot left but it could be changed in the future.

Dalaran
Quests around the current location of Dalaran shouldn't be changed with the expansion. It's just a matter of renaming a few things like "Kill people near Dalaran" into "Kill people near Dalaran Terrace".
