We thanks millions of Chinese wow players for your support. Nothing is impossible when we are together! We also thank Taiwan wow players for your tolerance and understanding. Hope we can share our honors with you.<br>
<br>
Too bad that wowprogress.com will miss the world No.1 guild (points-wise only, we respect Ensidia and thank Meka for those courteous comments) for days or even weeks. Hopefully there won&apos;t be another one-week-delay for the next patch so we can compete with best guilds in the world on every boss rather than those hardest ones only.<br>

Official Patch Notes Update<br>
The official notes have been updated to reflect the changes in this build.<br>
PvP<br>
Lake Wintergrasp<br>
Wintergrasp factories can no longer be damaged or destroyed.<br>
<br>
Dungeons and Raids<br>
Dungeon and Raid ID Extensions<br>
In order to allow for parties and raids to progress through instances at their own pace, players can now extend a dungeon or raid ID on an individual basis.<br>
Existing or recently expired IDs can be extended via the Social tab under Raid by clicking on Raid Info.<br>
The ID of any instance to which a player is saved can be extended. Doing so will extend the lockout period by the same amount of time as the original lockout (i.e. extending an Ulduar raid ID will add 7 days, a Heroic: Halls of Lightning dungeon ID will add 24 hours, and a Zul&apos;Gurub raid ID will add 3 days to the lockout time).<br>
An ID can be extended more than once.<br>
An extension can be reversed on an individual basis provided the player does not do anything in the instance during the extended lockout period that would save that player to the instance.<br>
<br>
Items: General<br>
Agility: The amount of agility required per percentage of dodge has been increased by 15%. This change required recalibrating the amount of dodge a player has with 0 agility by a slight amount as well, so all players will see their dodge percentage vary a small amount.<br>
Dodge Rating: The amount of dodge rating required per percentage of dodge has been increased by 15%. This is before diminishing returns. Combined with other changes, this makes dodge rating and parry rating equally potent before diminishing returns apply.<br>
Parry Rating: The amount of parry rating required per percentage of parry has been reduced by 8%. This is before diminishing returns. Combined with other changes, this makes dodge rating and parry rating equally potent before diminishing returns apply. Parry still diminishes more quickly than dodge.<br>

Enrage: This Bear Form ability now generates 20 rage initially, and 10 rage over the next 10 seconds. The armor penalty is unchanged.<br>
King of the Jungle: This talent now reduces the mana cost of Bear Form, Cat Form, and Dire Bear Form by 20/40/60%.<br>
Primal Tenacity: This talent no longer reduces the mana cost of Bear Form, Cat Form, and Dire Bear Form.<br>

Pets<br>
Roar of Sacrifice: Redesigned. This ability can now be used on any friendly target to make that target immune to critical strikes, but the hunter pet takes 20% of all damage taken by that friendly target. Cooldown is now 1 minute, up from 30 seconds.<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=670) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?mage))<br>

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=610) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br>
Protection<br>
Ardent Defender: Redesigned. Any damage that takes the paladin below 35% health is reduced. This reduction applies only to the portion that pushes the paladin below 35% health (example: a paladin at 50% health takes a 40% hit; the first 15% hits as normal while the next 25% is reduced). In addition, once every 2 minutes an attack that would have killed the paladin will fail to kill, and instead heal the paladin for up to 10/20/30% of maximum health depending on the paladin&apos;s defense rating (example: a paladin with defense equal to only 5 times his or her level will receive no healing from the talent, while a paladin who is immune to critical strikes from boss creatures through defense will receive the maximum amount).<br>
Guarded by the Light: This talent will no longer cause Divine Plea&apos;s duration to be refreshed by using Judgement of Wisdom, Judgement of Justice, or Judgement of Light.<br>

Psychic Horror: This spell no longer has an invisible missile, so there is no travel time before the spell takes effect.<br>
<br>
Shadow<br>
Dispersion: Cooldown reduced to 2 minutes, down from 3 minutes.<br>
Improved Mind Blast: Redesigned. Now, in addition to reducing the cooldown of your Mind Blast spell by .5/1/1.5/2/2.5 seconds, while in Shadowform your Mind Blast also has a 20/40/60/80/100% chance to reduce all healing done to the target by 20% for 10 seconds.<br>

Shadowflame: The angle of the cone effect on this ability was inadvertently very small, making it difficult to use. Its cone is now the same size as similar spells, such as Cone of Cold.<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=600) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warrior))<br>
Bloodrage: This ability now generates 20 rage initially, and 10 rage over the next 10 seconds. The health cost is unchanged.<br>
Execute: This ability now never costs more than a total of 30 rage. The tooltip for Sudden Death has been revised to remove reference to that maximum, since the ability now behaves that way even when untalented.<br>
Shield Block: Shield Slam no longer benefits from the increased block value granted by this ability. However, while Shield Block is active, Shield Slam generates 100% additional threat.<br>
<br>
Professions<br>
Engineering<br>
Added a new Mind Amplification Dish attachment for helmets, allowing engineers to control other humanoid targets. Some restrictions apply: does not work in Arenas, dish sometimes reverses targets, unable to stack with other stat-improving head enchantments and makes your helmet look... stylish? This attachment provides a passive bonus of 45 stamina.<br>
Gnomish Engineers and Goblin Engineers can now switch profession specializations for a fee.<br>
The Spynocular belt attachment has been changed to a Frag Belt. The Frag Belt periodically produces a Cobalt Frag Bomb that can be used from the belt every 6 minutes (never runs out!).<br>
<br>
Items<br>
