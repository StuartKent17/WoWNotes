In Patch 8.2, players will be able to complete a quest chain to obtain Gnome Heritage Armor  and Tauren Heritage Armor 
Rise up and stand tall with two new Heritage Armor sets—one for gnomes and one for tauren—coming in the Rise of Azshara content update.

Players with maximum-level 120 gnomes or tauren* who are Exalted with their faction Gnomeregan or Thunder Bluff respectively will be able to embark on a new quest line for each race to learn more about their history. Once you complete your quest, you’ll gain a new Heritage Armor transmogrification set unique to your race and be able to show off your pride.

*Tauren will also first need to complete the War Campaign quest Stay of Execution, which will be available shortly after the launch of Rise of Azshara.


  

Rise up to any challenge and show off the cog-nitive prowess of gnomish technology as you get ready to bolt into action in Mechagon and beyond.


  

Stand proud as you reconnect with your ancestors through a spirit journey to honor your tauren heritage.

Begin your journey by visiting the embassy in Orgrimmar or Stormwind after Rise of Azshara arrives.
