Boubouille2009-03-04, 05:06 PMYogg-Saron - Brain's Room Heavy Spoiler
For the first and last time in the history of MMO-Champion, you will see me using [spoiler] tags in a news post. If you listened to the sound files included in the last PTR patch, you probably noticed that most of the sounds used during the fight against Yogg-Saron are here. 

Some of these files are named "YSVisOne" "YSVisTwo" "YSVisThree" and seems to be related to something I didn't news yet, the Yogg-Saron Brain's room. You will most likely be teleported to this room during the fight and will witness past events of the Warcraft lore ... Needless to say that you shouldn't check the video or read the text below if you're scared of spoilers.

Mouse over the text to make it appear. Note: There are other audio files related to the fight, but spoiling them wouldn't add anything to the explanation and would spoil great parts of the fight. You can listen to some of them in this other video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6Pht3iRq8Y

Ulduar - Flame Leviathan
Yesterday the european players had a chance to test the Flame Leviathan, one of the boss in the outdoor part of Ulduar. The fight as it is on PTR is fairly easy and it wouldn't be surprising to see an harder version on live servers.
