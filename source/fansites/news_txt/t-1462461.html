Character Viewer Updated: Female Dwarf!<br>
You can see the previously released models here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3782-Artcraft-Daughter-of-Draenor-New-Orc-Female-Model). The character viewer update also added icons for the Blood Elf and Draenei models.<br>

<br>
We&#x2019;ve updated the model viewer on our website (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/warlords-of-draenor/#characters) with a look at one of the revised characters you&#x2019;ll see in Azeroth and beyond with Warlords of Draenor (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/warlords-of-draenor/). Meet the new and improved female Dwarf (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/warlords-of-draenor/#characters).<br>
<br>
It was a challenge for our character artists to find a balance between the classic female dwarf model and the expressiveness of her fluid new animations, but we think the updated model says &#x201C;descended from unyielding stone&#x201D; as much as &#x201C;griffon-riding, ale-swilling, loud-living hero.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll continue to unearth more of Draenor and the shiny visuals coming to World of Warcraft around the release of Warlords (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/warlords-of-draenor/). Keep your magnifiers and spectacles ready!<br>

New Orc Model Skin Colors<br>
A few people were excited by the wording of the new Orc Female model post yesterday, so Bashiok made it clear that players won&apos;t have access to brown skins at this time.<br>
oh wait, green and brown-skinned, long-tusked heroine.<br>
This is in reference to the brown skinned Orcs of Draenor, who will be using the new updated models as well of course.<br>
<br>
We know there are a lot of requests for additional features and options, but as stated in this article &quot;we made the decision early on to stay focused on improving what already exists in-game, and making sure we really nail it.<br>
<br>
That said, we&#x2019;ve also read your great ideas and feedback about features that you&#x2019;d like to see as character customization options. Your collective voice matters to us, and we&#x2019;d love to bring some of the coolest ideas to life someday if we can.&quot; <br>

New Orc Female Model Feedback<br>
Can we please get rid of the corn row buzz cut thing? I would think my orc would know how to keep parts of her head clean shaven she has been keeping it clean shaven for years.<br>
They&apos;re actually shaved lines, not braids. In some of the shots you can see they&apos;re not exact and not symmetrical, and that&apos;s intentional. Chris tweeted some backstory, and the intent is to give a bit more of a savage-warrior type vibe.<br>
<br>

<br>
I painted in some shaved lines, like she shaves that area of her head with her axe as a sign of her kills. as an example of where we&apos;re making small adj. to give characters more depth without (hopefully) deviating too much (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/295325-female-orc-corn-row-weirdness/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/11764546928?page=2#22))<br>
<br>
Looks good, only quibble is the tusks, seem too thin. In the kiss pose they look like little mustachios<br>
We&apos;re actually animating those for more range of motion with the face, so they&apos;re scaled down in that pose, not all the time. (Source (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/436220110169067520))<br>
