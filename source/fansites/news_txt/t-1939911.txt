Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
I think the MMOC forums have come full circle by saying is a genius 
It waxes and wanes with the moon. Legendaries are hard to design though. OccupyGStreet 

I wish people would stop bringing up on the forums...he doesn't work on WOW anymore, you idiots - he's not "ruining" you
The clever way some posters found to still blame me is the damage I did is so severe, it is taking multiple expansions to fix! OccupyGStreet 

what do you think about blizz response about classic realms? I think if enough people want it they should dedicate the resources.
My guess is they are a novelty that will seem awesome for two weeks and suffer from falling interest in two months. OccupyGStreet 
Given that, if it was easy to turn them on, it would make sense, but it's far from easy. Those servers don't exist anymore. OccupyGStreet
