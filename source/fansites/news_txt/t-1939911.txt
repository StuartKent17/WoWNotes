Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
I think the MMOC forums have come full circle by saying is a genius https://t.co/TrXy3xDkTP
It waxes and wanes with the moon. Legendaries are hard to design though. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689149714143428609

I wish people would stop bringing up on the forums...he doesn't work on WOW anymore, you idiots - he's not "ruining" you
The clever way some posters found to still blame me is the damage I did is so severe, it is taking multiple expansions to fix! OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689186785197342720

what do you think about blizz response about classic realms? I think if enough people want it they should dedicate the resources.
My guess is they are a novelty that will seem awesome for two weeks and suffer from falling interest in two months. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689149996478803969
Given that, if it was easy to turn them on, it would make sense, but it's far from easy. Those servers don't exist anymore. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689150161151365120
