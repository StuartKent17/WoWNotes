Mike Morhaime Interviews - Project Titan and Starcraft Ghost
Mike Morhaime, co-founder and former President of Blizzard Entertainment, has been discussing his time at Blizzard in a series of recent interviews  Most recently, he talked with VG247  about the canceled MMO project, code-named Titan. 


Titan was canceled because Blizzard failed to control the scope of the project. 
They looked at Titan as a sequel to World of Warcraft, a next-generation MMO. 
Many of their senior developers were put on project Titan. 
The game was very ambitious taking place in a universe focused on hystorical myth, with time travel mechanics. 
Titan would have been a subscription-based MMO had it been released. 
The engine for the game never reached the level of where it needed to be, and the developer staff said it wasn't working.
They asked the team to come up with one or two ideas they could focus on, it could be anything they wanted. 
Overwatch was the result of the Titan team's brainstorming and became the focus of their team.


Mike Morhaime also discussed the cancellation of Starcraft Ghost , what would have been a 3rd person action game set in the Starcraft universe.


Blizzard felt Starcraft Ghost couldn't be successful because of limited resources. 
During Starcraft Ghost development, World of Warcraft was exploding while Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2 were in development.
The team had to make tough choices on where to place its talent, and there weren't enough resources to go around. 
With Starcraft Ghost canceled, they could focus on injecting all their talent into other products.
