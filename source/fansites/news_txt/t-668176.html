Paragon (http://www.paragon-wow.com/) didn&apos;t need a lot of time to prove that they didn&apos;t need Holy Wrath to kill Anub&apos;arak in Heroic Mode. They did it again a few minutes ago and are also the first guild to achieve A Tribute to Mad Skill (25 Player) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3818/a-tribute-to-mad-skill-25-player/), congratulations to them.<br>
