Patch 7.2 PTR Notes Update<br>
The Broken Shore<br>
Return to the front lines of the Burning Legion&#x2019;s invasion in this new Scenario. Complete it to unlock a new questing hub with World Quests that make up a new Emissary and faction: Legionfall.<br>
<br>
Join in a new region-wide, cross-faction effort to construct buildings to fight against the Legion&#x2019;s stronghold.<br>
<br>
New Dungeon: The Cathedral of Eternal Night<br>
The upper chambers of the Tomb of Sargeras were once a place of worship to Elune. Since the Legion&apos;s invasion, fel minions have desecrated this holy place, twisting it into their own image. Now, this site will host a battle that could turn the tide of the invasion. While the Armies of Legionfall engage the fel army directly, a small group of heroes infiltrates the upper reaches of the cathedral in a desperate hope to return the Aegis of Aggramar to its resting place. Inside this new dungeon, you&#x2019;ll face:<br>
<br>
<br>
Agronox - This ancient served the night elves priestesses of the Temple of Elune, tending the beautiful Hanging Gardens. But after the malevolence of the Legion infected the Cathedral, the guardian absorbed fel energy through his roots. Now the twisted Agronox spreads corruption throughout the sanctuary he once protected, believing he has finally achieved his ideal state.<br>
Thrashbite the Scornful - Smashspite&apos;s detestable brother, Thrashbite has been dispatched to wipe out the mortals entering the cathedral&apos;s grand library. The dimwitted mo&apos;arg lacks any respect for knowledge or learning, feeling petty satisfaction as he crashes through ancient artifacts and tramples priceless tomes.<br>
Domatrax - With the Aegis of Aggramar socketed back into its cradle, Domatrax leads an onslaught of demons to destroy the relic.<br>
Mephistroth - With the forces of Azeroth pushing against his front line, Mephistroth has fallen back to the Cathedral of Eternal Night, where he will employ all his cunning to ensure the heroes fail in securing the Aegis of Agrammar.<br>
<br>
<br>
Class Campaigns<br>
Every class continues its campaign to unify in the war effort. Your Class Hall is the base from which you will embark on a new quest chain, find a new potential Follower, and discover new class-specific World Quests. All new epic class mounts are now available. Complete the new class mount quests to obtain yours.<br>
<br>
PvP Brawls<br>
A series of new twists on popular player-versus-player activities are on the way. Starting with &#x201C;Southshore vs. Tarren Mill&#x201D;, &#x201C;Gravity Lapse&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Warsong Scramble&#x201D;, PvP Brawls offer a variety of mode, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay. Look for the Brawl option in the Group Finder (default hotkey: i) Player vs. Player tab, under the Casual selection.<br>
<br>
Flying in the Broken Isles<br>
Take your final steps to complete the Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part 2 (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11446-broken-isles-pathfinder-part-two) achievement to unlock flying in the Broken Isles.<br>
<br>
New World Quests<br>
In addition to the new Legionfall and class-specific World Quests, a number of new and interesting World Quests are now offered by NPCs across the Broken Isles.<br>

Mental Fortitude (Artifact Trait) shield cannot exceed damage absorbed of 4% of player total health (was 8%), and now correctly calculates healing from Vampiric Touch.<br>

Assassination<br>
<br>
Urge to Kill now causes Vendetta to grant 60 energy, plus an additional 60 energy over 2 seconds.<br>

<br>
Affliction<br>
<br>
Refreshing Reap Souls will no longer overwrite the current buff&#x2019;s duration with a new one. The new duration will now be added to the existing duration, up to a maximum duration of 60 seconds.<br>
Reap Souls now has a 5 second cooldown.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; note: Previously, casting Reap Souls at 5 stacks (which would grant 25 seconds of the buff) with 20 seconds currently left on the buff would just overwrite your old 20 second buff with a 25 second buff. Now, in this case it will increase the buff duration to 45 seconds.<br>

<br>
Charge (and Intercept) now deals damage on arrival, and its snare begins after you hit your target.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeons<br>
<br>
Mythic Keystone Dungeons<br>
Added 60 seconds to the Black Rook Hold timer.<br>
Killing Cove Seagulls should now add Enemy Forces credit.<br>
New Affix: Bursting (level 4)<br>
<br>
When slain, non-boss enemies explode, causing all players to suffer 10% of their maximum health in damage over 4 seconds. This effect stacks.<br>
<br>
New Affix: Fel Explosives (level 7)<br>
<br>
Creatures have a chance to summon an Explosive Orb at a nearby location that will explode, inflicting damage of 50% of the player&#x2019;s maximum health.<br>
<br>
New Affix: Quaking (level 7)<br>
<br>
Periodically, players will Quake, inflicting damage of 20% of the player&#x2019;s maximum health and interrupting spell casts of themselves and nearby allies.<br>
<br>
New Affix: Grievous (level 7)<br>
<br>
While below 90% health, players are afflicted with Grievous Wound.<br>
<br>
The Overflowing affix has been removed.<br>
The Bolstering affix range has been reduced to 30 yards (was 45 yards).<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: The intent of this change is to allow players more opportunities for crowd control.<br>
<br>
Necrotic Rot will now expire after leaving combat. Duration reduced to 8 seconds (was 10 seconds).<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: This should eliminate the situation where players were waiting for Necrotic to fall off after killing enemies, and it should give tanks more opportunities for resets while in combat.<br>
<br>
Skittish threat reduction has been lowered to 75% (was 80%).<br>
Fortified damage bonus lowered to 30% (was 40%).<br>
Tyrannical damage bonus lowered to 15% (was 20%).<br>
Sanguine radius increased to 8 yards.<br>
Mythic Keystones can now direct you to Lower Karazhan, Upper Karazhan, and the Cathedral of Eternal Night.<br>
Artifact Power rewards for Mythic Keystone dungeons have been adjusted:<br>
<br>
Longer dungeons, such as Halls of Valor, now award a proportionately higher amount of Artifact Power.<br>
Shorter dungeons, such as Maw of Souls, now award a proportionately lower amount of Artifact Power.<br>
Artifact Power bonuses have been added to your weekly chest rewards. These increase based on the highest level Mythic Keystone you completed.<br>

The honor requirements for leveling through the honor system have been reduced.<br>
<br>
The amount of honor required to advance from 1 to 50 at Prestige 0 has been reduced by 50%.<br>
<br>
In instanced PvP (arenas, battlegrounds, and Ashran), Artifacts now grant a minimum Stamina increase to all players. This minimum is equivalent to the purchase of 36 points, one of which is the trait which grants 10% Stamina.<br>

World Defense Channel<br>
World Defense was disabled due to issues with the way chat channels functioned in conjunction with CRZ, phasing and sharding. Basically what happened is the chat channel would display an alert that say &quot;Aszuna is under attack&quot; but when ran there you might find it to be completely calm. This is because the alert triggered in Aszuna came from a separate phase or shard of that zone.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re still forwarding on the feedback we&apos;re receiving about this matter. (Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17614973841?page=1#3))<br>

Raid Testing Schedule - February 17<br>
On Friday, February 17, we will be conducting a raid test of two more Tomb of Sargeras Heroic bosses.<br>
<br>
Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. <br>
<br>
Friday, February 17<br>
<br>
Demonic Inquisition - Heroic Tomb of Sargeras<br>

Mistress Sassz&apos;ine - Heroic Tomb of Sargeras<br>

After testing concludes on Friday, we plan to open Normal Tomb of Sargeras over the weekend, with Goroth, Demonic Inquisition, Harjatan, and Mistress Sassz&apos;ine available.<br>
<br>
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br>
