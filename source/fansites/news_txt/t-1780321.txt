PTR Build Deployment - 5/13/15
Check back later today for another Patch 6.2 PTR build!
Hello everyone!

The PTR realms will soon be coming down in order to deploy a new 6.2 PTR build. The current ETA is around 6 to 8 hours.

I'll leave this thread open for discussion so long as conversations are civil and adhere to forum guidelines.


Raid Testing Schedule - May 14-18
Sorry for the late notice, but we were waiting on PTR build status to confirm testing dates. From tomorrow through Monday, we will continue our Hellfire Citadel raid testing, including both Heroic and Mythic raid testing. As is always the case with PTR raid testing, it is quite possible that there will be technical or gameplay issues that disrupt our plans. Thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.

Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Mythic difficulty requires a fixed 20 players. Our general plan is to test every encounter on Heroic difficulty first, and then test sections of the raid on Normal and Raid Finder, alongside targeted Mythic tests.

Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below on all PTR servers.

Thursday, May 14

Socrethar - Heroic Hellfire Citadel - 13:30 PDT 16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST
Archimonde - Heroic Hellfire Citadel - 15:00 PDT 18:00 EDT, 24:00 CEST


Friday, May 15

Shadow-Lord Iskar - Mythic Hellfire Citadel - 11:30 PDT 14:30 EDT, 20:30 CEST
Hellfire High Council - Mythic Hellfire Citadel - 13:30 PDT 16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST


After Mythic raid testing concludes on Friday, we will open the Bastion of Shadows Raid Finder wing, including Iskar, Socrethar, and Tyrant Velhari, over the weekend.

Monday, May 18

Iron Reaver - Heroic Hellfire Citadel - 13:30 PDT 16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST
Mannoroth - Mythic Hellfire Citadel - 15:00 PDT 18:00 EDT, 24:00 CEST


As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.


New Mystic Runesaber Mount — Now Available
It looks like the mount http://www.wowdb.com/spells/180545-mystic-runesaber is incorrectly classified as a ground mount and it will be able to fly after all!
Update 21:10 CEST -- We are experiencing technical difficulties with this item in the Blizzard Shop, and it is temporarily unavailable for purchase. We're working hard to fix that and we apologize for the inconvenience.

The enigmatic Mystic Runesaber mount has manifested. Sheltered by chaotic arcane energy, these creatures have eluded capture for millennia. Now they’ve emerged from the shadows to hunt for new sources of magical power. Tame their wild energy and make one of these arcane allies yours!
