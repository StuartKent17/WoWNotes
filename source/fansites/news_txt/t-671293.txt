A new enchanting recipe, Abyssal Shatter, is now available on enchanting trainers.

Brewfest Extended
Brewfest is a time of year where the focus is placed squarely on the celebration of fun and food. In order to give everyone enough time to truly experience this event and after some fine tuning on the part of the event organizers, we will be extending the event two additional days. The festivities will end on October 5th at 11:59PM, so donâ€™t miss it!
