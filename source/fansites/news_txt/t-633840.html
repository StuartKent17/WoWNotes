Patch 3.0.9 on live servers this week<br>
Look what we&apos;ve got here, a brand new patch and it was totally unnanounced! As usual nothing is confirmed by Blizzard yet but it looks like the patch is definitely going live this week (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/february/9551client.jpg)! The talent calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com) is already up to date and you&apos;ll see these changes on your server very soon. <br>
