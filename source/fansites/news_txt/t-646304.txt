Boubouille2009-04-28, 04:11 PMUpcoming Changes and Additions
These features are NOT part of the patch 3.1.1a deployed today. You will have to wait a few more days/weeks before you can see them on live servers. 
Updated Argent Tournament Mounts
In an upcoming minor patch, faction mounts offered by vendors on the Argent Tournament grounds will have their visual appearances improved. You will find that the mounts being offered will better match the colors of the faction you chose to represent. Mounts already purchased at the Argent Tournament will automatically be replaced with the updated mounts when this patch goes live.

The ten mounts using the original tournament look will then be available for purchase from Argent Tournament vendors for 5 Championâ€™s Seals and 500 gold faction discounts apply. To purchase these original mounts at the Argent Tournament, players must be either members of, or exalted with, the corresponding faction.

Equipment Manager Coming Soon
That's right, it's back! When enabled from the Interface Options menu, this feature will allow players to store sets of equipment, easily swap between saved sets using hotkeys, and pull items directly from backpacks or bank slots must be at the bank to equip inventory from the bank.

More information about the Equipment Manager originally slated for release with the Secrets of Ulduar content update can be found here:  

Neth, can you please clarify? There will now be 2 mounts per faction purchasable from the Tournament, correct? One for 100 seals and one for 5 seals and 500g?
That is correct. One of those is the updated mount and one is the current mount just for an alternate cost. The currently available mounts will be the ones being updated if you've purchased it already. Otherwise, you'll have two options per faction. This applies to the ground mounts.
