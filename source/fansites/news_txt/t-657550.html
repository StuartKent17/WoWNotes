Zoltan - First player to reach 10,000 Achievements Points<br>
Less than a year ago achievements were added to the game with the release of Patch 3.0. Today, Zoltan (http://armory.wow-europe.com/character-achievements.xml?r=Aegwynn&amp;cn=Zoltan&amp;gn=Refuge) (Refuge (http://www.refuge-guild.de/) @ EU-Aegwynn) was the first player to hit 10,000 Achievement points! <br>
<br>
Congratulations to him, that&apos;s definitely a LOT of motivation. <br>
