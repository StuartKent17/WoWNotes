World of Warcraft BlizzCon Gear Store Merchandise
The Blizzard Gear store  has been updated with new BlizzCon 2017 products. Orders are only open to Virtual Ticket holders today, but will open for everyone on 10/17. We've highlighted some of the more interesting items below, but you can see them all here 


  


World of Warcraft Sargeras Shirt
The shirt description  potentially explains the wound added to a map in Patch 7.3.2. Check out the shirt description for spoilers!


 

  


World of Warcraft Raptor Plushie
This raptor  doesn't spoil anything in its description, but an interesting raptor mount was recently added in Patch 7.3.2. The ArmoredRaptor mount is still encrypted, so we don't know what it will look like. A new creature was also added that uses hoofprints and existing horse sounds in Patch 7.3.2, but the model is encrypted with the same key as the ArmoredRaptor. You can also pick up a Elekk plushie ! 


  


Pirate Plush Pepe
This new Pepe  features a pirate hate and eye patch, matching the Pirate Pepe  you can see in game. He is part of the I Found Pepe!  achievement!


  


Kul Tiras Armor Sets
These are not for sale, but with BlizzCon approaching now is a good time to post a reminder about these sets that were added in Patch 7.3. 


 


Overwatch - Halloween Terror Event
The Halloween Terror Event is live until Nov 1st , bringing new cosmetics, a new game mode, and more! Check out the new intros and emotes on the official post.
