Sinister Gladiator&apos;s Maledict (https://www.wowdb.com/items/165806-sinister-gladiators-maledict) now immediately displays a new additional debuff on players targeted by the trinket&apos;s spell indicating when they will be struck by its damage and healing absorb effects.<br>

Patch 8.2 PTR - Nazjatar Budding Deepcoral Item<br>
Recently, the Budding Deepcoral (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/169885-budding-deepcoral) was added to the PTR, allowing you to ride your underwater mounts like normal mounts in Nazjatar. This item costs 5 Prismatic Manapearl (https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1721-prismatic-manapearl) and can be purchased from the same vendors that sell the Benthic Gear (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8502-Patch-8-2-PTR-Benthic-Gear-Preview-Raid-Testing-Schedule-May-9-10-DLC-677) in Nazjatar. The item is consumed on use and doesn&apos;t provide any indication that the item is active. It persists through log outs, but is removed the moment you leave Nazjatar and must be repurchased to use again.<br>
