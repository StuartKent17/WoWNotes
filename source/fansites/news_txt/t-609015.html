New Splash Screen - New Game to be Announced ?<br>
A new splash screen has been activated on http://www.blizzard.com (http://www.blizzard.com) and is probably the sign of an upcoming important announcement ... this week end during the Worldwide Invitational ? The last time Blizzard did something like this was for the announcement of Starcraft 2 and it&apos;s probably now only a matters of day before we hear the name of Diablo 3 from official sources.<br>
