A couple of minutes ago, Eyonix announced he would leave the Community Team and Blizzard to explore other opportunities. I don&apos;t think we can do anything more than wish him good luck.<br>
<br>
I usually do not share personal opinions in news posts but I&apos;ll make an exception and say one thing: Damn. That sucks. <br>
For nearly six years, we&apos;ve shared our thoughts with one and other, we&apos;ve laughed, we&apos;ve argued, and we&apos;ve cried -- the crying part was just me wasn&apos;t it? Those times, I&apos;m afraid must come to an end as I&apos;ve made the decision to explore opportunities outside of Blizzard.<br>
<br>
It has very honestly been a huge pleasure, and I thank you all for allowing &apos;Eyonix&apos; to always remain a very fond memory as I move on.</div></div>
