Subtlety

Refreshing or expiring Ruptures, Garrotes, Crimson Tempest, and Hemorrhages should no longer incorrectly remove other Rogues' Sanguinary Veins.


Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios

Blackrock Foundry

Oregorger

Oregorger's health has been reduced by 10% on Normal difficulty.
Oregorger's Rolling Fury ability now deals less damage on Normal difficulty 135,000 damage and on Heroic difficulty 200,000 damage.


The Blast Furnace

Heart of the Mountain should no longer spam raid warnings for Blast whenever it reaches 100 Energy.
Mind Controlled Firecallers should no longer be able to cast Reactive Earth Shield on injured Primal Elementalists.


Kromog

Kromog's Reverberations should now be easier to dodge with a 3-second delay before the ability starts dealing damage up from 1.75 seconds and the effect's radius has been decreased.


Beastlord Darmac

Beastlord Darmac's Call the Pack now has an increased cooldown of 40 seconds up from 30 seconds on Normal difficulty.
Fixed an issue where the doors to Beastlord Darmac may not always reopen after the encounter has been reset.


Operator Thogar

Enrage mechanic for the encounter is now more lethal.


Iron Maidens

Admiral Gar'an: Dominator Turret's Dominator Blast no longer deals damage to player pets, minions or guardians.
Enforcer Sorka's Convulsive and Lingering Shadows are no longer incorrectly removed when the targeted player dies.
Marak the Blooded's Blood Ritual still only targets a player within 45 yards but the damage cone now has a range of 100 yards.
Fixed an issue where Iron Maidens not on the Dreadnaught may instantly cast their spells and abilities at the end of the boat phase.
Fixed an issue where Marak the Blooded was incorrectly gaining Sanguine Strikes at 75 Iron Fury on Mythic difficulty.


Blackhand

Rubble Piles should no longer appear after the transition to stage two.
Fixed an issue where a player may not be correctly protected from Blackhand's Impaling Throw when multiple players were taking cover behind the same Rubble Pile.
