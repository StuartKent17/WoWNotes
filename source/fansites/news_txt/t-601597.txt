Blizzcon is next week, the first bunch of official informations will probably be released tomorrow once everybody is back to work. I'll ask people to not post fakes features list, skills list, etc on the forums Already deleted 2 of them today, don't make me look like I work. They're all fake, we're 6 months away from the release of the expansion and everyone thinking that Blizzard already have precise skills list available is a fool.
All the Blizzcon informations will be reported on the site as soon as they're released. Stay tuned next week. 

Jokes
There is a WoW-Joke post going on the forum. Some of them are pretty good, and if you're bored this sunday, you might want to waste a few minutes reading them.

Website
This week we had a few server issues, with the site being slow a few times, etc ... This should be fixed next week and I hope you won't experience any downtime. But if you can't reach the site for a few hours, don't worry, it's *cough* working as intended.
