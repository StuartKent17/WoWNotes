PTR Build Deploy 2/14/2017
Deploy Update:
We ran into an issue and are going to have to put the deploy on-hold for tonight. Gunna work some things out and hopefully get servers back online sometime tomorrow. I'll provide a more accurate window when I have one. Thanks for your patience everyone!


PTR Development Notes - Build 23578
We’ve got another heavy content push to the PTR this week, so here’s a quick rundown of the biggest things you’ll see available for testing:

We’re ready to start testing flying on the Broken Isles, as well as the quest chains to earn your Class Mounts. The actual processes to unlock these features are still in development, so for testing purposes, we’ve added a temporary NPC in front of the Menagerie in Dalaran that will grant you both parts of the Pathfinder achievement and start you on the quest to earn your Class Mount. Please let us know if you encounter any areas around the Broken Isles where flying isn’t working properly e.g., getting dismounted in midair, or if you have any issues with the Class Mount quests.

7.2’s new 5-player dungeon – the Cathedral of Eternal Night – is open, and should be available for testing in its entirety. Please let us know what you think!

This build also has a significant number of changes and improvements to the Mythic+ system:

Mythic Keystones can now direct you to three new dungeons: the Cathedral of Eternal Night, Upper Karazhan, and Lower Karazhan. Several new affixes have been added to the mix: Bursting, Fel Explosives, Quaking, and Grievous. Bolstering, Necrotic, Skittish, Fortified, Tyrannical, and Sanguine have been adjusted, and Overflowing has been removed. Some boss and trash mechanics have been adjusted for example, Seagulls will now grant Enemy Forces credit in Eye of Aszhara. For PTR testing, Flaskataur in Dalaran will sell a Keystone Container, and affixes will be on a 4-hour rotation instead of weekly.

On top of those changes, we’ve re-adjusted the way that Artifact Power is awarded from running Keystone dungeons, with the goal of better rewarding you for the time it takes to complete each dungeon. Longer dungeons such as Halls of Valor will now award a proportionately higher amount of AP, and shorter dungeons such as Maw of Souls will award proportionately less.

In addition, we’ve added an Artifact Power bonus to your weekly chest, which increases based on the highest level Keystone you completed. You’ll earn the largest AP bonus for completing a Level 10 or higher Mythic Keystone. Our goal here is to shift the AP rewards from Mythic+ slightly more in favor of completing higher-level Keystones, and less toward endlessly farming lower-level ones. This should also greatly increase the amount of Artifact Power you can earn on alts without requiring as much direct time investment.

Notably absent from this build are the new Broken Shore World Bosses, as well as a few improvements to the process of acquiring Legendaries. We’ll have more details on those changes as they get closer to implementation.

Happy testing!


Hotfix - Nighthold Bosses Now Guarenteed to Drop AP Items
This is a step in the right direction. Next step is for Blizzard to adjust AP rewards from Mythic raids. If I full clear Nighthold on mythic difficulty in 4-5 hours, I should be getting the most AP/hour possible. A +10 is nowhere near as difficult and is usually much more efficient than the hardest PvE content that the game has to offer.
We agree that Nighthold in particular needs to be a better source of Artifact Power than it has been, but that change won't be happening with Patch 7.2.

Because it'll be in 7.1.5.

And it went live via hotfix this morning.

Nighthold bosses are now guaranteed to drop AP items


Artifact Power
Just a quick note: the 7.2 Artifact Knowledge and Artifact Power curves that have been datamined are not final - what you're seeing is just temporary values. With those temporary values, the increase from Artifact Knowledge scales linearly, while the Artifact Power required to purchase the next trait increases exponentially. This makes it seem as though the new traits are intended to require far more effort to earn than was the case in 7.0, which is not the case.

The PTR build coming today doesn't yet have the correct numbers, but next week's build should. At that point, you should see a much lower expectation for how much effort will be required to unlock the new traits.

It's important to remember that the PTR is very much a part of our development environment. When we pull a build to push for public testing, it's basically just a snapshot of wherever we happened to be at that moment in development. This means you're going to see a lot of placeholder and unfinished work. This is one such case.

Feedback is certainly helpful for us in determining exactly what the final state should be, but please remember that there's a very reasonable chance for anything on the PTR - especially datamined content that's not yet fully available for testing - to simply be unfinished and/or temporary.


Transmog Set Feedback
Well met! The upcoming PTR build that will be deployed this week will contain an almost-data-complete version of the Transmog Sets feature. We're still ironing out a good number of bugs mostly relating to which items are displayed in any particular set, but by and large we feel like it's feature complete for 7.2. We're not going to add any more sets right now but we can always add more in the future. 

There is some time to do small modifications based on feedback, so we'd like to hear what you think about it in this thread! Log on to the PTR and visit the Sets tab in the upper left of the Appearances tab Shift+P. You will see many sets for your class that you can collect! All of this data is based on what is in your transmog library, and the usual rules about what you can and can't collect apply here too. We also added some achievements and a title!

Any bugs especially those related to specific sets should be reported in the bug report forum, but thoughts and feelings should be posted here.

Any updates on missing set pieces from previous raids e.g. Firelands plate waists, ICC Death Knight boots/waists, etc?
We are adding them for PVP sets, but only because 1 the total number missing is much smaller than PVE, 2 the item names are consistent and predictable, and 3 the rest of the items are all on vendors already, and we're using the new items to fill out ensembles. 

We are not adding any items for PVE sets at this time. The scope of items that we need to add is far too large for us to take on in the time we have allotted to finish 7.2 -- it is much more than a full raid tier's worth of items on its own. This has been a great chance to thoroughly audit what is missing from the game, and we'll be adding these items in small chunks in future content releases to complete various sets. 


Feedback - 7.2 Mythic Keystone Dungeons
Hi all,

As mentioned in this week's PTR Development Notes, there are several changes to Mythic Keystone Dungeons now available for testing. We'd love to see any feedback you can give us regarding these changes, including the new dungeons, new and updated affixes, Artifact Power redistribution, and anything else you encounter that you feel is worth sharing.

Note: There is currently a known issue with Upper Karazhan Keystones which is causing you to start the run in the wrong location. We'll get that fixed in an upcoming build, but for now, we're going to hotfix the door that requires Moroes' Keys to be open by default, so you can progress through the dungeon that way.

Thanks!
