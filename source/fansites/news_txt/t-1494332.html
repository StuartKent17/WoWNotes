Am I just stupid or bad at hunters or do they seem focused starved 90% of the time?<br>
Starved? No... It&apos;s a resource that they build and spend. They have a no-CD builder, so it&apos;s impossible to be &apos;starved&apos;. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445696496713740288))<br>

does marksmansnip mastery has cd? my barrage got 40shot under 62%mastery and got less than 10 wild quiver hit<br>
Wild Quiver has a reduced chance to proc from individual Barrage hits since the ability hits so many times so quickly. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/446326248948498432))<br>
so,thats mean there a input cd (or something else) like arms sweeping strike<br>
No cooldown, just a lower chance to proc. It&apos;s possible that it could proc from every Barrage hit, just very unlikely. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/446331982151024640))<br>

I&apos;ve taken another stab at the frost math and really hope you&apos;ll take a look: http://t.co/Jt1YR143oE<br>
You&apos;re using one set of ET% for all builds. That&apos;s obviously flawed, since the ET% are based on your stats. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445608357005500417))<br>
(Mostly by haste. The more haste you have, the more Fb you&apos;re going to fit between each LB, for example) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445608687034327040))<br>
Keep it up. This peer-review part of theorycrafting is super important, and to me, fun. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445608959827648513))<br>
It can be hard; it&apos;s not easy posting your work for all to see, and having people point out how you&apos;re wrong. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445609097946099712))<br>
But I think the process of peer-review is one of the most important parts of theorycrafting, that many specs&apos; communities have been lacking in lately, leading to bad theorycraft spreading and becoming trusted. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445609400007270400))<br>
If you guys delivered us an operating manual for each spec, we wouldn&apos;t have to guess so wildly<br>
That&apos;s neither needed, or the problem. Bad math for the optimal rotation is bad math. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445657749687242752))<br>

Healing Spheres being removed for WW? I agree that if feels odd but removing it feels like a loss of a good backup heal.<br>
They&apos;re being compensated for that loss elsewhere. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445998482856624129))<br>

I think the issue is a slow rotation filled with pauses is considered less &quot;fun&quot;, even if it&apos;s equal DPS statwise<br>
Right, and I understand that concern, and am informing you that we are keeping that in mind, and not changing it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445008734507376640))<br>
Even so, having limited access to haste will affect how ret feels/play due to not being able to get haste through gem/reforges..<br>
Again, you won&apos;t have limited access to haste. You *will* be able to customize gear. You *will* be able to get gear that has... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445010029767184384))<br>
...the stats you want. I understand that it&apos;s hard to convey through 140char, but your concerns aren&apos;t being ignored. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445010146704371712))<br>
<br>
curious about hopo generation tbh. Feels really good on live, dont want to go back to only 1 hopo generator. Thanks 4 reply<br>
No plans to change HoPo generation significantly. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444998143306784768))<br>
Will there be any changes to SoB? Ret will struggle extremely with its current model once gems/reforges are gone.<br>
Sanctity of Battle? No... Why would it? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445001693407633408))<br>
Without reforging and gems, the ret rotation will feel very slow and filled with gaps cause of little to no haste.<br>
That&apos;s definitely false. Gems are part of items&apos; budgets, and Reforging just moves stats around; no significant change there if... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445004218030510080))<br>
...you care about and stack haste. Overall, negligible impact, if any. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445004308266749952))<br>
...will make crit/mastery items even more unattractive over a haste+X counterpart, X being crit or mastery.<br>
If you love haste, yes, haste/Anything beats crit/mastery; aim for getting haste items. Regardless, all of the secondary stats... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445007949316911104))<br>
...will be useful, and closer in value. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445007998935523328))<br>
So SoB &amp; Ret rot. design the same, but we&apos;re over-exaggerating how &quot;TAKE IT &amp; SHUT UP&quot; we&apos;re imagining stat options?<br>
Very much so. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445011789613240320))<br>

If you remove the healing from Divine Star for Shadow, that talent will stop being used by SPriests. Is that the intent?<br>
No, and we don&apos;t think it will do that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446554061857234945))<br>
<br>

That&apos;s the sort of answer I was hoping for, thanks. What about cd stacking? Enh is a big transgressor there, esp in pvp.<br>
Yeah. Enh is one of the worst, because the strength of their big CD scales with gear. +20%dmg in blues, +100%dmg in 580s. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445674499447353347))<br>
Err, big CD*s*. That describes both Fire Elemental and Ascendence. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445674645979541504))<br>
<br>
No-- enh skill cap is tiny. Simcraft predicts 1.3% difference btw (over)optimized and (very)simplified priorities.<br>
That says nothing about how high the skill cap is, just how valuable high skill is. We want to raise that value. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445680163733262336))<br>
<br>
should we expect any big changes to the Enh Shaman rotation / priorities?<br>
Kind of. Enh suffers from a major case of &quot;thirty-different-damage-sources-so-all-of-them-feel-meh&quot;-itis. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445661544399908864))<br>
We&apos;re generally happy with Enh&apos;s gameplay (which is whack-a-mole at base skill levels, but does have a high skill cap). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445661765381021697))<br>
However, we&apos;re going to try to maintain that gameplay, while removing or combining many of the damage sources. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445661889377234944))<br>
For example, compare http://t.co/AiVKyUn9sS (12 dmg sources)... to http://t.co/dPrdUe81JC (34 dmg sources). Are they all... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445663001983455232))<br>
...really needed? Can we combine some? Some are MH vs OH of the same strike, so that&apos;s naturally inflating things, but even... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445663225598582785))<br>
...still, that&apos;s a ton. Anyway, point is, we&apos;re going to try to maintain the same gameplay, but fewer, more impactful sources. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445663460538343424))<br>
That&apos;s the same mentality for most classes moving into WoD, right? Maintaining gameplay, more impactful choices?<br>
Yes, but I think Enhancement exemplifies that most of anyone. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445668036431728640))<br>
I&apos;m concerned because the spec is currently fast/full of choice because of all the buttons, is it being dumbed down?<br>
No. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445670458801659904))<br>
How so if half the possible choices for every given gcd are removed?<br>
I definitely did not say that half the possible choices for every GCD are being removed. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445670953645637633))<br>
It was hyperbolizing for the sake of illustrating my concern.<br>
I said nothing of the sort, though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445671427488759808))<br>
Fair enough, you did not; so what sort of damage sources would be removed if not buttons?<br>
Just Example, not Announcement: Unleash Wind does a pittance of damage, and a useful buff. Could we cut the damage, buff the buff? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445673271401271296))<br>
Remove the spell as enh, and replace it with a new melee ability (medium damage)with a smaller cooldown = fun + useful<br>
Do you really want *another* meh-dium damage ability? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445982693722181634))<br>

Dear Cele, never gets old, but why be any other dps when you can be warlock? And why did you guys stop game balance hotfixing?<br>
There&apos;s a huge conversation to be had about *when* to nerf. Short answer is that nerfing warlocks would also nerf *guilds*. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446704086339944448))<br>
Instead, we think the right call is to leave them until Warlords, then fix them there. We agree that they&apos;re too strong now (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446704252052721665))<br>
I think it&apos;s better to balance the class, then nerf content as needed based on the class rebalance.<br>
Requires making an assumption about how many Warlocks guilds were using. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446753924985270272))<br>
No need for assumptions, you have the numbers.<br>
...but it varies by guild. That&apos;s the point. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446767860254142464))<br>
<br>
T14 beta, Demo Tank preformance similar to other tanks. Nerfs came. Revert nerfs, rebalance, Demo tank live?<br>
UI support, Active Mitigation skills, multiple cooldowns, talents with defensive benefit, glyphs with defensive benefit, an interesting defensive rotation, defensive value for all stats (that&apos;s gigantic), Vengeance, DPS tuning, mob control abilities, defensive mechanics that scale at the right rate, community understanding, etc. Warlocks are/were nowhere close to being full-fledged tanks. Sorry, it&apos;s just not the same thing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446889136243232769))<br>
feel like there&apos;s a similar argument for making prot a dps spec that goes beyond what one talent can do.<br>
On the contrary, Prot Warriors have all of the DPS equivalents of those, or are getting them anyway for other reasons. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447164578720264192))<br>
<br>
That&apos;s great, but when raid needs a tank, Warrior can hit a button and be one, while I have to switch to my alt DK.<br>
That&apos;s something you signed up for. We don&apos;t treat &quot;ability to respec to a different role&quot; as something we balance. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447437520863641600))<br>
No, I didn&apos;t. When I signed up as a Warlock, they could only DPS, Warriors could only tank, Paladins and Druids could only heal.<br>
Pretty sure that&apos;s objectively false. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447438437402955776))<br>
It definitely is. I played vanilla wow. As a fury 2h spec warrior, top dps through BWL and AQ40. Quit lying.<br>
I also played one of those specs widely considered unviable as well, back in vanilla, to great effect. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447439500130516992))<br>

Warlords of Draenor Stats<br>
All this talk about base health and base damage; why not exponential scaling, Would make these considerations irrelevant.<br>
We do use exponential scaling, and while the pros drastically outweigh the cons of doing so, needing to squish is the big con. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446699559356338176))<br>
I think he also meant zero base value, all value from stats. Which is happening with damage. Useful for health too?<br>
...That /is/ happening for health. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446701121768136704))<br>
I misinterpreted something then. Thought base health drastically reduced, not eliminated. Sounds good to me then.<br>
Base health is gone. A naked character has only a bit of health from their base stamina. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446701786041053184))<br>
So is Ironman leveling dead?<br>
It&apos;s certainly much harder. Likely possible still on specs that can kite. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446767740150239232))<br>
<br>
since dodge is removed from the game, how guardian druids gonna survive bosses?<br>
Dodge is not removed from the game. Dodge is removed *from gear*. You already had no dodge on your gear. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446902539661758464))<br>
so still there dodge gems?<br>
No. It won&apos;t be a stat you find on gear, even through gems. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446907513686859778))<br>
then how shall a guardian tank now?<br>
Things like Savage Defense will still give Dodge. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446913227092262914))<br>
<br>
will WoD (tertiary stats?)random attribute have a RNG factor to number/percentage it gives? (like imperfect % drops in diablo,)<br>
Nope. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447437107196203008))<br>
