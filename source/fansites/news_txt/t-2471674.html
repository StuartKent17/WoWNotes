hatiHati Returns with New Customization<br>
Hunters will be reuniting with their favorite wolf from Legion in Patch 8.1.5. On top of this, Hati is receiving a plethora of different customization items!<br>
<br>
<br>
Level 120 hunters can start the quest chain by heading to their BfA faction hub and talking to the Image of Mimiron.<br>
You can do the quest on any spec, but Hati is only usable by Beast Master hunters.<br>
The quest involves you working with Mirmiron, Grif Wildheart, and Thorim to reconnect with Hati&apos;s essence. You will travel to locations such as Storm Peaks, Siluthus, and Ulduar.<br>
Once completed, you will be able to tame 6 different variations of Hati (the original 5 models from Legion and one new color)<br>
The PTR did not limit you on which models you could tame based on what you unlocked in Legion, so it seems that any hunter who completes the quest gets access to all of them.<br>
After completing the quest, you also have access to certain items that benefit Hati, such as making him into a mount!<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Charged Sparkstone (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/167800-charged-sparkstone) - Use: Bring out the latent power in Hati&apos;s lightning, visually enhancing Hati&apos;s abilities. (60 sec cooldown)<br>

cycleCycle of Life Tortollan Quest<br>
An interesting new world quest has been added to the Tortollan lineup called the Cycle of Life. <br>
<br>
<br>
It takes place with Scrollsage Nola (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/134344-scrollsage-nola) and can spawn anywhere that the baby turtle quest Beachhead resides.<br>
This quest is very different from helping baby turtles to the water. Upon reaching it, Nola will tell you &quot;These tiny crabs need help! I hate to see any living things suffer. Would you be willing to lend a hand?&quot;<br>
You then take control of a crab and must move left or right in order to block baby turtles from reaching the water whilst avoiding the orb attacks from Scroll of Blasting (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/292149-scroll-of-blasting).<br>
After blocking a baby turtle, its shell will appear on your head and you can use Throw Turtle Shell (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/292287-throw-turtle-shell) to take out any baby turtles in a line up the beach.<br>
The quest ends when you block 20 baby turtles from the water. Nola exclaims &quot;All creatures in nature must live together in balance. But I can&apos;t help cheering for the little turtles!&quot;<br>

Darkmoon Faire Severed Fish Heads<br>
Vanion (http://www.vanion.eu/news/patch-8-1-5-witzige-fische-auf-dem-dunkelmond-jahrmarkt-19841) discovered that Severed Fish Heads can be fished up from the waters around the Darkmoon Faire. There are two types of fish heads, Severed Crimsonscale Head (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/164972-severed-crimsonscale-head) and Severed Azurefin Head (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/164973-severed-azurefin-head). They last for one day in your bags and when clicked provide a 60 minute buff that places the fish head on your character!<br>
<br>
The tooltip reads &quot;Something strange is happening in the waters surrounding Darkmoon Island...&quot; perhaps hinting at the speculated relationship between the Darkmoon Faire and Old Gods. In the Warbringers: Azshara cinematic (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7924-Warbringers-Azshara?page=8), N&apos;zoth first appears to Azshara as a fish.<br>
