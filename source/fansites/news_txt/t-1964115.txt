Get on Your Hearthsteed and Ride
If you’re new to the fast-paced card-slinging action of Hearthstone, you can also earn a magnificent Hearthsteed to charge across the battlefields of Azeroth upon.

This epic flying mount is awash in a mystical blue glow—its rocky exterior just barely manages to contain the power that lurks within! When you’re ready to take to the skies, the Hearthsteed manifests ethereal blue wings, ready to carry you off to your next adventure.

Getting your hands on this unique flying mount is simple . . . and fun! Just win three games of Hearthstone in Play or Arena mode to earn the Mount Up! quest reward in Hearthstone. The next time you log in to World of Warcraft, the Hearthsteed will be waiting for you in your in-game mail.
