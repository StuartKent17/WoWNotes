Kirin Tor Quests and Flying Mounts
We haven't decided whether or not we'll make any changes to restrict flying on the Kirin Tor World Quests. We did anticipate they would become a lot easier with flying and, as such, we have no intention of taking action against players who use flying to easily complete these World Quests in their current state.
