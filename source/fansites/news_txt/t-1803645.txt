The Road Ahead: Legendary Ring Questline
Blizzard posted a preview of the legendary quest line today. The EU blog talks about defeating Gul'dan while the US version does not. 

This time around, the legendary quest will require you to upgrade your shipyard to Level 2 http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/39057-command-of-the-seas Upgrading The Fleet http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/39245-upgrading-the-fleet and do some Naval missions http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/39697-master-vs-commander in addition to the normal raid item collection http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/39000-we-dont-need-no-library-card.

You’ve survived a long and dangerous journey thus far on Draenor. One portal has been destroyed within Tanaan Jungle... but Gul’dan and the twisted remains of the Iron Horde still strive to open another portal into Azeroth. You’ve allied with powerful forces to counter these nefarious plans, including the Archmage Khadgar. His efforts to fight the rising power of Gul’dan have presented countless new challenges and powerful rewards—but only for those stalwart enough to take on his formidable tasks.

Follow along with us, won’t you, as we walk you through the next—and final—chapter in Warlords of Draenor’s Legendary Ring quest line, culminating in Patch 6.2. And if you’re just getting started—or want to pick up where you left off—we’ve put together a guide of the journey so far.

6.2 SPOILERS BELOW!

Patch 6.2: Chapter IV: Darkness Incarnate
Acquire your legendary ring by completing Khadgar’s quests.

The Final Assault
The campaign on Draenor has been taxing and perilous, but there’s more that needs to be done. In the quest The Final Assault http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/37841-the-final-assault, you’re asked to head back to your Garrison to await further instructions from Archmage Khadgar. Ominous news is spreading that Gul’dan has taken over what remains of the Iron Horde—as if history is doomed to repeat itself despite the valiant efforts of the Horde and the Alliance forces. To face this evolving threat, you’ll need to ready yourself to go back to Tanaan Jungle.


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/thumb/legRing01.jpg http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/legRing01.jpg 

You’re going to need a bigger boat to get to Tanaan, and are soon tasked to build a Shipyard in your Garrison to get you there. You’ll also be able to build a fleet and send ships out on missions to help turn the tide of the war.

Khadgar will meet you at your new dock to explain the next steps to earning your ring and putting a stop to Gul’dan’s nefarious machinations. First, you’ll need to work on Upgrading your shipyard to Level 2 http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/39057-command-of-the-seas and then take on legendary shipyard missions until you earn the draenic sea chart. Khadgar also wants you to venture into Hellfire Citadel within the heart of Tanaan Jungle for the quest We Don't Need No Library Card http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/39000-we-dont-need-no-library-card, which tasks you with collecting Tome of Chaos http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127115-tome-of-chaos.


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/thumb/legRing02.jpg http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/legRing02.jpg 

Once you’ve collected the tomes, it’s time to start Cooking the Books—or at least it would be if Cordana would cooperate and burn them as she should. Sometimes, if you want to get something done though, you’ve got to do it yourself. You’ll have to fight Cordana to stop her from keeping the books and taking your precious, precious ring.


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/thumb/legRing03.jpg http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/legRing03.jpg http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/thumb/legRing04.jpg http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/legRing04.jpg 

Once Cordana is defeated, Alliance characters will meet with Yrel to receive K’ara’s blessing, and Horde characters will meet with Drek’thar to receive a blessing of the elements. You’ll also receive your shiny new Legendary ring. You’re going to need it for what you have to do next. There’s just one thing left to do: go after Gul’dan.

Once Gul’dan has been defeated, you’ll earn the Chapter IV: Darkness Incarnate http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/10021-chapter-iv-darkness-incarnate achievement, and gain a new monument for your Garrison.


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/thumb/legendaryRingMonument.jpg http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/legendaryRingMonument.jpg 

After all of that work, we won’t blame you if you crack open a celebratory Kaja’Cola by your monument as you gaze at your lovely new ring. You deserve it.

New Players and the Cost of Lower Level Materials
I go and look at the AH and Light Leather is 194 gold for a stack of 20
But then a new player could quite easily get 20 Light Leather and make 194 gold by selling it, right? An inflated market isn't too much of an issue, even for brand new players, when the commodities being bought and sold are infinite in availability and accessible by everyone. Low level players in some cases are even at an advantage, as materials they easily come across by simply playing the game content they are being directed towards is sought after by higher level players, or those with more wealth than time to seek it out.

Player Feedback and Action
are a waste of space
I'd have to respectfully disagree. Every day our team and developers are here reading comments and suggestions, and regardless of the level or volume of frustration, it's still feedback to us. Can some of it be delivered in a more mature fashion? Sure. Should the level of maturity dictate whether or not we read and consider it? No.

As you can see with recent changes, we're listening. And I can assure you we will continue to listen and keep doing our best to make World of Warcraft the very best game it can be.

Hey.. I mean if you guys are listening.. thats great!.. but how about actions?
Actions are constantly being taken. What's frustrating for some individuals is they're not seeing the action in a time-frame they'd prefer which is often unrealistic. Gathering feedback and making adjustments to the game based on it takes time. And if we can pull away from this very moment, and from what's "hot" in the minds of many, and take a look back with from a wider perspective, you'll see numerous changes that have come directly from player feedback. Above all else, it is valued and appreciated.

All complainers who complain about complainers complaining are subject to complaints.
This is actually not that far from the truth which leads into...

I wish you guys would take steps toward making these forums and the game a less hostile environment.
Spirited debate can often times appear hostile to one or more persons involved. I was a moderator of these forums for years and saw every type of report one can imagine. More often than not, it was because someone wouldn't change their opinion to match the reporter's and thus was considered a troll or worse. This isn't to make light of what you said, of course, just an example of what I've seen. It's a matter of stepping back and remembering what you're discussing. Obvious violations such as language or racism should be reported using the tools in place. However, if it's a topic such as flying where varying passions are colliding, just take a step back and remember it's all based upon a passion for the same thing: playing World of Warcraft.

Flying
Is Draenor Flying meta-achie a bnett account-wide achie? E.g. get exploration on char1, loremaster char2, rest on char3 work?
Yes, it's a blue-header BNet achievement, and credit for achievements earned on different characters will be combined. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/609192147619725312

This new method of unlocking flying is actually way better for future expansion and patch releases. Finish a patch zone?
I think it has great potential. Let us know when it lands how it feels. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608845863276806144

reintroducing flying? huge mistake. you caved under the minority's outcries again. thanks
No issue is black or white, design is a world grey areas, exploring them is part of the process. Looking forward to feedback. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608847340334546946

Character / Items
Off subject,but is there any kind of headway at all for an Archaeology title this expac,an especially daunting task with no reward. I have petitioning for Curator title since Beta
Interesting idea! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608883581520220160

PvP
I found world pvp was much better before flying mounts. Post flying nothing will save it.
Never say nothing. Players ganged up in PvP combat for Sha of Anger at MOP launch, and in groups on Timeless Isle. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608879987710513154

WPvP has lacked rewards since Classic honor/PvP ranks grind. Out-of-BG rewards might help. Shell just helps griefers force "PvP."
TI Ordon faction, Wintergrasp, Tol Barad, TBC Auchindoun, Grizzly Hills Venture Co. had rewards. Which did you do? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608889557291929600

For world PvPers, flying adds a complication. Did the Hardened Shell in MoP work for you? World PvP objectives in TBC? TI ordon faction? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608879018314756096
also if you guys could consider adding a weekly 'Kill X faction leader'' quest to encourage city raids again, that'd be SUPER.
That's a fun idea Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608902735841234944

will there be a new set of coliseum gear at launch of 6.2? Setting up guild war games.
The existing Tournament gear has had its ilevel updated to reflect the new season. You don't need to buy a new set. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/609120760641159169

Is Arena Master still obtainable in 6.2? 
Yes! The arena event is unchanged outside of the addition of the new lootable heirloom for Grand Masters. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/609141841229819905

How about the Highmaul Coliseum, will that also still reward additional conquest gear?so 3 pieces a week?
A Coliseum victory no longer grants a piece of gear. It now grants 1500 conquest. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/609456579247628290

Lore
Mhh, the Eyes of Kilrogg, were described as created apparitions. So are they ghost-like demons, demonic ghosts, or merely. ghost-like + demon-like blobs of fel energy?
This is just MY opinion, but I've always considered them a disembodied part of a defeated species, enslaved by the legion. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608876159627988993
Like imagine they're this cool army like the zerg that just assimilates conquered species as they go, but in a diablo way. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608876371524210688
Not official canon in the slightest, though. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608876521734823936

Does this mean fel energy doesn't consume souls? 
I think you can be pretty sure that it does considering you're using SOUL SHARDS Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608883839922929664

UI / Addons
Hunter pets showing up in the Boss Frames is still not fixed in 6.2 
Via Stampede? How recently have you checked? We think this was fixed in the past week. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/609192206331543552


Release the Names! Character Name Reclamation Coming
With the upcoming Warlords of Draenor patch 6.2, we will be releasing sidelined characters’ names back into the wild. Any characters that have not logged into the game since December 7, 2010 will have their names freed up, making them available to anyone creating a new character or using the paid Character Name Change service.

How Do I Preserve My Names?
You will need to log in to World of Warcraft and enter the game using each character whose name you wish to retain before patch 6.2 goes live. While it is possible no one will claim your recently released name and you might be able to snag it again, it is probably not worth the risk if you want to keep your names intact long-term.

Our goal with this great name liberation is to make sure new and returning players have a large and varied pool of names available to choose from—so log in now if you wish to preserve your unused characters’ names for your ongoing journey through Draenor.

The Name I wanted wasn’t freed!
Going forward, we expect to free inactive names around the release of new expansions. Prior to the reclamation process, we’ll post more information on the timeframe this will occur to allow you the opportunity to preserve your name.
