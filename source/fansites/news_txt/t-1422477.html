Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br>
<br>
To help smooth difficulty scaling as players are added or removed from a Flexible raid, several raid boss abilities that target additional players as the size of a Flexible raid increases will use weighted randomization rather than strict breakpoints. For more information on the change, check out this thread (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10585638963?page=4#77) on the Dungeons, Raids and Scenarios forum.<br>

Flex Mechanic Scaling Hotfix<br>
Fun fact: The hotfix has actually been active since just before the weekend, but it didn&apos;t get caught in the prior round of hotfix notes. It&apos;s no surprise that it went largely unnoticed, since most all of the abilities with actual breakpoints going from 14-&gt;15 are things with very minor impact (Protectors&apos; Shadow Word: Bane, Nazgrim&apos;s Bonecracker, Hisek&apos;s Multi-Shot, etc.). There are indeed a couple of more impactful breakpoints on Garrosh&apos;s Touch of Y&apos;Shaarj and Sha of Pride&apos;s Imprison, but those both occur at raid sizes well above 14, and randomization isn&apos;t the correct solution to either.<br>
<br>
The 14-player &quot;magic number&quot; is actually a fairly interesting social dynamic, since there never was anything particularly special about the number, and now there really is objectively no advantage. As we&apos;ve said in the past, there&apos;s certainly nothing wrong with wanting to form a 14-player raid, but if you&apos;re turning away strong players or friends because you&apos;re convinced that your raid as a whole will have a harder time, you&apos;re making a mistake.<br>
<br>
<br>
Changes to Flex Mechanic Scaling<br>
The previously discussed changes to scaling are now live! <br>
At BlizzCon, we&apos;d discussed some improvements to our Flexible scaling system that would minimize the existence and impact of any real or perceived &quot;breakpoints.&quot; Our design goal has always been for the system to be neutral with respect to group size. Specifically, you should never feel encouraged to turn away interested players whose skill/gear level matches the rest of the group&apos;s, basic role composition constraints notwithstanding. But at the same time, you shouldn&apos;t feel like you need to go out and grab warm bodies if you have a perfectly serviceable raid already assembled. Clearly we have not yet fully realized those goals.<br>
<br>
In general, the existing healing/damage scaling slightly favors larger groups, since boss health and damage scale up more slowly than does raid throughput. To use a specific example, an 18-player raid with 12 damage-dealers will kill a boss slightly faster than a 10-player raid with 6 damage-dealers (assuming equal skill/gear between the two groups). But it is true that currently some specific abilities exhibit breakpoints, where adding an extra player causes an extra add to spawn, or an ability to strike an additional target.<br>
<br>
To help smooth out difficulty scaling as you add or remove players from your Flexible raid, we will be implementing one of our planned Warlords changes to the scaling system ahead of schedule. In the near future, several boss abilities that target more players as the size of a Flex raid increases will use weighted randomization rather than strict breakpoints. <br>
<br>
An example to illustrate what I mean:<br>
<br>
Today, Sun Tenderheart&apos;s Shadow Word: Bane ability afflicts 2 targets if your raid size is between 10 and 14, but begins to hit a third target at 15. <br>
<br>
Once our upcoming change is in place, if you have a 13-player raid, there will be a 60% chance for each cast of the ability to hit 3 targets, and a 40% chance for it to hit 2. If you add an extra player, and thus have 14, there will now be an 80% chance for 3 debuffs to go out, and a 20% chance for only 2. <br>
<br>
In short, with respect to this particular ability, adding an extra player will always give you an average of 0.2 extra Bane debuffs. No more breakpoints!<br>
<br>
There will be a handful of exceptions where breakpoints remain necessary. Imprison on Sha of Pride is probably the most notable such example, where you really want to pre-plan who will cover which prisons, and having a random number of targets each cast would cause frustrating unpredictability.<br>
<br>
There&apos;s nothing wrong with 14-player groups -- 14 players is a great size for a raid. But so is 15. And 19. And 12. And 22. We just want to help make sure that good players aren&apos;t being turned away from groups because of the notion that their presence will make things harder for everyone. <br>

Mounts Blocking Holiday Questgivers<br>
Grr! Yeah, some people can be jerks. Some people are just oblivious though, too. If you think someone is specifically and intentionally blocking an NPC in a malicious way, that is behavior specifically mentioned in our harassment policy, and something you can report that player for and we&apos;ll take a look.<br>
<br>
An easy workaround though is enabling nameplates for friendly characters (default Shift+V) and then right click on the nameplate of the NPC you&apos;re wanting to interact with.<br>
<br>
For me, it&apos;s the fact there&apos;s a group of around 40 horde, give or take, literally camping the greench and AoE spamming the treats and metzen preventing any alliance from completing their daily. I don&apos;t mind some PvP action on a PvP server, but this is ridiculous.<br>
Holiday events tend to be quite active the first couple days, but this one lasts for 2 1/2 weeks, and you can certainly complete most of these things throughout the event and have plenty of time to grab all the achievements/complete all the quests without needing to do everything the first day.
