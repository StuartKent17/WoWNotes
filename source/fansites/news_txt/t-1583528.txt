Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons: Trading Post
Today we are taking a look at the Trading Post  garrison building.

The Trading Post  take up a Medium plot which can also be used for a Barn , Gladiator's Sanctum , Lumber Mill  or Inn / Tavern  Once upgraded to Tier 3, your garrison will have two Medium plots available. 

Abilities
This building is good for farming and spending excess crafting reagents or garrison materials, using the auction house, earning reputation faster, and accessing some transmog gear. 


Level 1 - Allows the trade of crafting reagents for garrison resources and vice versa, for a profit! 
Level 2 - Enables access to the auction house. Also grants access to the Shattari Defense or Laughing Skull factions.
Level 3 - Increases reputation gain in Draenor by 20%.


Reagent Conversion
Keep in mind this is beta and a server designed to test garrisons, so final numbers can change!


Trade ~10 of a randomly selected crafting reagent for 100 garrison resources.
Purchase a stack of 5 crafting reagents for 10 - 40 garrison resources.
If you purchase the crafting reagents for a work order, you have a net gain of 20 - 80 garrison resources.



    


Auction House
Access to the auction house doesn't come automatically, as the robot auctioneer is lying on the floor broken. You need to complete the Auctioning for Parts  quest, which requires collecting parts to build modules for the robot. The parts come from garrison invasions, dungeons, Ashran, and the mobs in the Draenor zones. You can also purchase the parts, as they are not bind on pickup.

FEEDBACK: Highmaul - Arcane Sanctum LFR
We will soon be opening the second wing of Highmaul Raid Finder Tectus, Twin Ogron, Ko'ragh, and leaving it open over the weekend. These fights are likely overtuned - Ko'ragh definitely is, but we have some changes in the pipeline that will be picked up by restarts tonight. We'll be watching closely to make the required tweaks to get the experience to where it needs to be.

Epicurean Change Reverted
Thanks for the feedback. The change to Epicurean is being reverted on Beta.

Yeah, we actually decided not to make some changes we were considering. Epicurean is returning to 100%. - @Celestalon Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Classes
want to bring back the healthstone discussion. Whats the point of making them obsolete? Why must they be weaker than prof items?
"Tonics>Stones" means that both get used. "Tonics<Stones" would mean that Stones are always used, virtually never Tonics. Celestalon 
You left one out. What about Tonics = Stones? Also, what utility will Warlocks have? Gateway is nerfed to hell.
then how come LW drums dont follow the same logic? Shouldn't "Drums>BL/TW/Hero" so you ensure both get used? Same logic
No; we don't want Drums to be used normally; they're backups. It'd mandate everyone take Leatherworking. Celestalon 
Whereas Tonics are created by a profession that everyone can have, and are tradeable and usable by anyone even w/o FA. Celestalon 
There's no LW restriction on Drums of Rage. I can go buy them off the AH same as Healing Tonics
Drums are designed to be different. A backup, not a primary source, obsoleting a raid buff brought by several classes. Celestalon 
I understand that the distinction may be hard to see, but it's very intentional. Tonics are the primary reason for... Celestalon 
...First Aid to be valuable in Warlords. Healthstones are a minor perk to a class, like Mage food, not a raid buff. Celestalon 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Another related change: Tower of Radiance is supposed to be a consolation prize. Beacon healing should win. Celestalon 
1 Holy Power is just too strong, nowadays, compared to the Beacon healing. So, we're planning to change... Celestalon 
...Tower of Radiance to restore Mana instead of Holy Power; a tunable amount. Celestalon 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Please remove Burst of Speed. It promotes horrible gameplay
Rogues are losing the 10 extra energy from their MoP set bonus. On beta the relative cost of BoS has doubled & regen is lower. holinka 
15 energy cost from a pool of 110 13.6% to 25 energy cost from a pool of 100 25%. holinka 
And cloak and dagger is left a dead talent again? Step tier seems healthier and popular.
We won't be changing an entire talent row at this stage. holinka 

They also have a lvl 90 talent which gives them 15 xtra energy and higher regen... The ability honestly needs to have a CD.
Level 100 but I get you. We think there are other ways to manage it than a cooldown. holinka 

We just don't have many changes to discuss currently; not ignoring or hating. Rogue talents are less impactful than we'd... Celestalon 
...like, but aren't causing any problems, so aren't at the top of our priority list to redesign right now. Celestalon 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
New Windstrike/Stormblast animation pales in comparison to the live version...chance we could get it back? 
Old one doesn't fit with the wind theme, instead of lightning theme, unfortunately. Celestalon 
I Err... "the elements. Fire check. Air check, lightning falls under this.... " your quote on ele thread.
Wind and Lightning are both part of the 'air' type of Shaman magic. However Lightning is nature damage, wind is physical. Celestalon 
so the change to physical damage for ascendance was to tone down burst, yes? Is that why it doesn't scale with mastery?
Yes. Scaling burst multipliers are problematic. Celestalon 
But right now, 20% of our dmg are buffed by 50%.It's just really weak now. Then at least reduce CD to 2min.
Those numbers are not even remotely accurate. It's still quite strong. Celestalon 

Character / Items
So in WoD what will happen to the valor quest for the cloak?
Removed. WatcherDev 

Warlords of Draenor Stats
No control over secondary stats, and L100's with different weights - means weak choice of talents: pushes us to one L100 always
But you *do* have a ton of control over secondary stats. Celestalon 
170 enchants, 200 flask, 50 food = 420 stats, out of ~4k in PvP gear best case? 10% stat control. PvE = no control of drops.
A Those numbers are definitely not accurate. B You act like you don't have control of stats on gear. Extremely false. Celestalon 

PvE
is the fix just a numbers nerf? Or are you looking into altering/removing more mechanics for the LFR version?
Mostly numbers, plus removing the healing effects of Moss entirely and making Flamethrowers take much longer to overheat. WatcherDev 

So did the design team decide to go back on Normal 5mans gearing you up for LFR?
I think you misunderstood: Normal Dungeon -> LFR is one path. Heroic Dungeon -> Normal Raid is another. WatcherDev 

.can we please get more raid trash like Ultraxian and Sindragosa?
I'd always considered those a bit tedious, but if it's what the people want.... WatcherDev 

can we also defeat the Boss of L/H/N/M after defeated it again in a week? Just no loot, but can farm again?
Not for Mythic, but the other difficulties, yes - they are loot-based lockouts. WatcherDev 
So it's means that the number of loot based on the number of players who have the right to loot?
Correct. Kill a boss with 25 players, but 20 of them have already killed it once, and you probably only get 1 drop. WatcherDev 

PvP
I was wondering if you could clarify the future spectator idea. Is the plan to make it so a player can jump into a live game&watch?
No, the idea is for people that want to broadcast tournaments to be able to do so in the live game. holinka 
any plans on updating the UI to be more new viewer friendly?
Yes but not for release. Just wanted to get this into people's hands as quickly as possible. holinka 

Ok I still think it'd be really cool to have a client you can jump into live games with.
It has a high implementation cost & in the age of twitch, probably won't see much use. holinka 

Lore
Why does Kargath die in LFR but live in all other difficulties? Isn't that against the point of "LFR is for the story
It's more "he lived 2 weeks ago when we tested Heroic, but dies now that we're testing LFR." Story change. WatcherDev 

Will we see any any Worgen lore in WoD? Seems like they got a lot of attention in early cata and have been forgotten since
Worgen are definitely part of the Alliance forces on Draenor, but WoD's story is mostly focused on the Iron Horde threat. _DonAdams 
I would like to see more Worgen and Forsaken lore as well. Their time will come around again, I'm sure. _DonAdams 

Dear Adams, what's the current status of Ethereals as of WoD? Really looking forward to seeing more of them!
They don't really have a presence on Draenor, sorry! They showed up to Outland after it was shattered. _DonAdams 

So, I'm still unclear with the relationship between the Klaxxi and the Sha. As parts of their god, shouldn't they have been ally?
Klaxxi wanted to maintain their cycle and wait for Y'shaarj himself to come back. They weren't ready to drink the Kool-Aid. _DonAdams 
So they saw the Empresses inability to resist only an aspect of their god as a weakness and she was deemed unworthy?
Sha is fallout from Y'shaarj's death, but it was still harmful to their cycle crazy queen, blighted homeland. _DonAdams 
She was forcing a swarm too soon; corrupting eggs with Sha energy; ruining the kypari. Went off the deep end, threatened cycle. _DonAdams 
So yes, she was deemed unfit to rule. It's a shame they were ultimately swayed by Y'shaarj's heart, though. _DonAdams 
Will we ever see them again? Kil'ruk's death quote makes it seem ambiguous if they even die there.
The paragons are near and dear to me, but sadly I think they're actually dead, short of some amber reincarnation miracle. _DonAdams 

World
could create edges only between the fps you want connected?
I'm fairly sure that that's exactly what it does already. The paths don't exist yet; it'd use them if it did. We'll make them. Celestalon
