Achievement - The Rat Pack
The Rat Pack http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11431-the-rat-pack has proven challenging to figure out, but Tzhaa http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/935642-Tzhaa and other group members have done it!


There are several rats that spawn between between Curator and Shade of Medivh
These rats are lootable and will give you a Rodent of Usual Size http://www.wowdb.com/items/143664-rodent-of-usual-size
Once you have mounted the rat, you can defeat the Mana Devourer and will earn the achievement!
