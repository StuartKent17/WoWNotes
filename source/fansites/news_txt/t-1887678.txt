Legion Website - Pre-Purchase Testing
The Legion website was updated to add a Pre-Purchase button today, linking to a Battle.Net Shop page for Legion Digital Deluxe. The shop page gave an error rather than product information and the Pre-Purchase button was removed about an hour later, so it looks like it was only testing. 

Digital deluxe details haven't been announced yet, but we can look at Warlords Digital Deluxe http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3828-Warlords-of-Draenor-Pre-Order-and-Level-90-Boosts-Now-Available as an example. We know Collector's Edition will get the Illidari Felstalker mount http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5125-Legion-CE-Mount-Illidari-Felstalker-Darkmoon-Faire-Updates-Blue-Tweets-DLC-503 and the similar looking pet: Nibbles http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/95841-nibbles.

Blue Posts
Upcoming Patches
No. We aren't skipping ahead. We'd like to make sure we have time to test and make sure any improvements we make especially on the engineering end work well. This is a very complex game with complex systems no matter how simple they may seem. 

I'm not sure anyone should be 'suffering' through anything. If you're not enjoying yourself with something, perhaps others can direct you toward something in game you can enjoy. I can understand wanting to get to the next new thing. It's always exciting to get to experience something completely new, but new takes time. 6.2.3 will have some nice additions and changes as we've already announced so hopefully you'll get something out of it when it releases. Feel free to test things out on the PTR too.

Why can't we get a blue post on relevant things? I would love to hear some real reasons for why WoD patches were trash and not the time old excuse that "it just didn't work out" And there is nothing new here...Just reworked systems and bosses from other expansions
You're not really asking a question. You want us to agree "x was trash." We're just not going to do that. We do however try to make sure we're taking feedback and game experiences on many fronts to note so that we can continue to find ways to improve on the game.

We're not always going to agree on what that means, but we'll keep trying to find ways to give people fun experiences within the game.

We've seen a lot of these, "just admit" posts. They're not questions. They're statements of opinion that we take note of, just like we take note of those that say, "we are enjoying x." We do our best to keep learning and growing whether you believe it's the 'right path' or not is just a matter of preference. That doesn't stop our bid to do better where we can as a goal for the overall health of the game.

Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
"What games have you played for a long time that didn't recycle or reuse levels, dungeons, etc.?" My favorite kind of way to reuse a level is when you cannot complete the level because you’re missing an upgrade that you will acquire later, like Super Metroid did so well.‎ 
That works for Metroid almost out of tradition, but it can be really annoying if done poorly. "Come back here in 30 hours when you have the ladder to reach this shortish ledge!"

By the way, the most common answers I got for that question which I originally posed on twitter at ‎@occupygstreet:
-- Lots of difficulty levels so you keep running the same content over and over... kind of.
-- Procedurally generated content e.g. random maps or monsters.
-- Player generated content through a robust tool system. 

Are the skills required for cooperation in LoL, or maybe those in WoW, useful in the 'real world'? That is, winning in arenas in WoW might still require knowing good players who will group with you, but once a match has started, cooperation is just mechanical, not social. In LoL, random matching
The skills that are most applicable are making quick judgment calls with limited time and information, getting people total strangers even to see your point of view and rally around a strategy, keeping morale up in the face of tough news, and communicating succinctly.
I have interviewed and hired people because their experience leading e.g. a large raiding guild spoke of their leadership potential. 


Watch the WoW Arena World Championship During BlizzCon Opening Week
This weekend, the final battles of the World of Warcraft Arena World Championship get underway at BlizzCon Opening Week http://eu.battle.net/blizzcon/en/blog/19893626/blizzcon-opening-week-october-28-to-november-1-9-17-2015. We've gathered eight of the best teams from around the world who will fight for their share of a $250,000 prize pool and the title of BlizzCon 2015 Arena champions.

The Opening Week action begins at 1:30 p.m. PDT on Friday, October 30, and continues at that same time on Saturday, October 31. Be sure to tune in to our free live stream on the official BlizzCon website http://eu.battle.net/blizzcon/en/esports/wow/.

Of the eight teams competing at Opening Week, only six will advance to play at BlizzCon 2015 the following week. Let's take a closer look at each of our competitors:

SK Gaming – Europe
SK Gaming formerly known as Solari Gaming Blue took first place at the European Road to BlizzCon event in an epic 5-game series against Skill Capped EU. Their presence at BlizzCon 2015 should come as no surprise, as all of these players have repeatedly proven themselves to be among the best of the best in the World of Warcraft Arena. 

Skill Capped EU – Europe
Although they were defeated by SK Gaming in the Grand Finals at the European Road to BlizzCon, Skill Capped EU formerly known as Solari Gaming Red had a tremendous run throughout the tournament. Now, with Opening Week on the horizon, this team is looking to come back swinging and take the championship title at BlizzCon 2015.

Solari Gaming – Europe
Solari Gaming is quite possibly the team with the most to prove in this year's WoW Arena World Championship. At the European Road to BlizzCon under the name Solari Gaming Yellow they faced off against Three Languages One Team for the third and final spot at BlizzCon . . . and lost. However, they caught a lucky break after Three Languages One Team was unable to travel to BlizzCon. How will Solari Gaming Yellow make use of their second chance at glory?

Cloud9 – North America
This team qualified for BlizzCon 2015 under the name Juveniles—and with less major tournament experience than several of the other teams, and only three members on their roster, many considered them to be the underdogs. However, after taking first place at the Americas Regionals, that all changed, as Cloud9 proved themselves as one of the strongest RMDs Rogue/Mage/Druid combo in the world.

Tempo Storm – North America
It should be no surprise to see these guys at BlizzCon. Elite, Pikaboo, and Jahmilli have repeatedly shown to be one of the strongest teams in online tournaments over the past couple of years, and with Starship filling out their roster, they were nearly unstoppable at the Americas Regionals. Now Tempo Storm is out to prove that they have what it takes to be the BlizzCon 2015 champions.

FollowEsports.com – North America
FollowEsports.com's path to BlizzCon 2015 was rocky at best. They were the last of the six North American teams to qualify for the Americas Regionals, where they came in third place, narrowly beating out Luminosity. However, they've proven time and again that they can’t be kept down. Will this be their time to shine?

Do It For Fun – Korea
Yeonyeon and Coding competed as members of team Push Push at BlizzCon 2014 and fought their way past some incredibly strong competitors to advance to the semifinals. Now, with Jyottu and Mudyane joining them, Do It For Fun is here for another shot at that first place prize and the title of BlizzCon champions.

Original Gangstarr – China
Original Gangstarr is composed of an all-star lineup from China. XaioJie, Han BaiChuan, and Darkarchonyo have all qualified for BlizzCon before, and YiYang won the Chinese championship in 2014. Although they may not be as well-known as some of the other teams, these players should absolutely not be underestimated.

Prize Pool
This year's Arena World Championship features an epic $250,000 prize pool, which will distributed to each team based on their standings as follows:

1st place team: $120,000
2nd place team: $50,000
3rd–4th: $20,000
5th–6th: $12,000
7th–8th: $8,000


Commentators & Analysts
We'll be joined once again by our seasoned lineup of shoutcasters and analysts:

Sid 'Supatease' Compston
Elliott 'Venruki' Venczel
Jared 'vhell' Coulston
Josh 'Lore' Allen
Jackson 'Bajheera' Bliton
