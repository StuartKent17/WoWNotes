Nope, but there's a decent probability of seeing it next week and we all know what it means: one week to play Portal 2!


Chat With Your Guild Using the Mobile Armory
The remote guild chat is now available on all realms from the official site.



The remote guild chat is part of the "World of Warcraft Remote" service and costs $2,99 / month also includes the remote Auction House 
The service works on all realms and a free preview is available for players of the Fizzcrank and Lightbringer realms.
Not available on Android yet. 


A new feature has just been added to the World of Warcraft Mobile Armory app: remote Guild Chat! As part of the latest update for the free Mobile Armory app for the iPhone and iPod touch, the new Guild Chat feature lets you stay in touch with your guildmates wherever you go:



Read and contribute to your guildâ€™s in-game chat channel in real time


Participate in one-on-one conversations with members of your guild


View the members of your guild who are currently online


For a limited time, players can use the Guild Chat feature without a subscription to World of Warcraft Remote. During this time, we'll be rolling out the Guild Chat feature to select realms, with more realms being added in the future -- check out the list below to see if the feature is currently available on your realm. After the free preview period ends, players will need to have a subscription to World of Warcraft Remote in order to continue using the feature. We'll announce the end of the free preview period, along with the availability of the feature on Android devices, in the near future -- keep an eye on the official World of Warcraft website for further details.
