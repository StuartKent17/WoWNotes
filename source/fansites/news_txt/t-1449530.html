Warlords of Draenor - Developer Interview<br>
The ReadyCheck podcast (http://www.readycheck.co.uk/) had the opportunity to talk with several developers recently. You can find a full transcript of the interview on their site (http://www.readycheck.co.uk/season-3-episode-2-q-a-holinka-hazzikostas/), and the highlights below:<br>
<br>
Arenas<br>
<br>
Arenas didn&apos;t fit the game as well back in Burning Crusade, as classes weren&apos;t designed to be balanced for 1v1 or 2v2 in PvP then, but things are better now.<br>
The arena history stats were removed from armory because they took up a lot of storage space and weren&apos;t used by many players. It might be possible to add some sort of history for Trial of the Gladiator.<br>
Solo queue arena is something the developers are looking at, but there are several challenges that would have to be overcome before it was possible. (The number of players for each role isn&apos;t balanced, having to queue until you find a decent group to play with, randomly created comps that aren&apos;t great, etc) <br>
The developers are aware that some players want skirmishes back, but the development time needed would take away from time spent on something else. Being able to do arenas without consequences would be nice though. <br>
Arena prep times might be slightly too long.<br>
<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
<br>
Patches involve an initial overhead no matter how many changes are in them, so more frequent patches to address PvP balance would slow down the creation and addition of new content. <br>
Hotfixes can also be used to help with balance and are much easier to do. <br>
Rapid changes are hard to keep up with, and small tweaks don&apos;t have a large impact on PvP, so these aren&apos;t the best ways to handle changes.<br>
Allowing people to solo queue for things greatly increases the participation rate, but it also increases toxic behavior. Hopefully the Group Finder in Warlords of Draenor will make it easier to find groups to do PvP with.<br>
<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor PvE<br>
<br>
The developers realize that there is still an audience for Burning Crusade level difficulty Heroic dungeons. Challenge modes were designed to be harder content, but the focus is on speed and not as much on having to use as much CC, so they don&apos;t capture the essence of Burning Crusade era Heroics.<br>
One idea that came up for Warlords of Draenor was offering a chance of LFR level rewards for completing hard dungeons with a deliberate pace. This would give players that wanted more challenging content a way to do harder content with friends and still be rewarded well. <br>
Mythic dungeons are also a possibility for the future, though none are planned right now.<br>
Warlords of Draenor raid bosses will continue to use a mix of familiar raid mechanics, new raid mechanics, and new tech to create interesting encounters. Siegecrafter Blackfuse is an example of a boss that combined familiar mechanics to make a fresh encounter.<br>
<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor Misc<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor has a harder and darker story than Mists of Pandaria did.<br>
Warlords of Draenor improves the questing experience by showing the main story line in each zone on your UI and encouraging exploration. Outdoor content that isn&apos;t based on daily quests but still allows some progression will also help.<br>
The guild finder tools need an update, but it isn&apos;t likely to happen for Warlords of Draenor. Being able to do more things cross-realm will allow guilds to try out or find new members.<br>
There are no plans for going free to play right now, as they are happy with the current business model. <br>
There will be more expansions after Warlords of Draenor.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Random Battleground Queue Times<br>
Faction imbalance is definitely something that&apos;s contributing to the lengthy queue times. That said, we agree that allowing Horde vs Horde and Alliance vs Alliance Random BG&apos;s isn&apos;t a great answer. We&apos;ll do it if it&apos;s absolutely necessary (Rated BG&apos;s allow for same-faction battles for exactly this reason), but we&apos;re going to look at all other options first. <br>
<br>
Honestly, even if we can&apos;t find another good answer, we&apos;re not sure queue times are so bad, at least at the moment, that same-faction Random BG&apos;s would be worth it. Horde vs Alliance, Orcs vs Humans, Elves vs Trolls etc. has long been a strong core of the Warcraft universe. We want queue times to be faster for everyone, but we also don&apos;t want to lose that.<br>
<br>
20 minute queues at peak hours makes BGs FAR less worth it than just doing dungeons and trading for honor.<br>
Definitely agree here, but that&apos;s part of a larger issue we&apos;ve been discussing lately about the random BG reward system. I don&apos;t have any specifics to share just yet, but it&apos;s very much on our radar. We&apos;re actually hoping that whatever changes we can make along those lines will also have the side effect of helping queue times a bit (though again, we&apos;re still looking into more options there).<br>

Classes<br>
Hi any plans to make all buffs passive auras like shaman buffs. I think buffing is not skillful ore interesting anymore.<br>
Buffs (like Mark of the Wild) don&apos;t really take up keybind space. They also have a perk that the caster can die. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/423925865013985280))<br>

the death knight ability [Death Grip] has ben bugged on the two new maps since release, planing on fixing it this decade or what ?<br>
We have a fix but it requires a patch. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423881147257348096))<br>

Arcane Shot is a main culprit of Hunter specs feeling identical. One of the things being looked at?<br>
Yep, it is. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/423623231082209280))<br>

For what purpose does an attack over 30% max hp cancel lightwell ticks?<br>
I believe it was originally so that it would be ignored by tanks, and left to raid members. I&apos;m not sure that that&apos;s needed now. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/423543387048800256))<br>

Any chance you could make Enhance&apos;s Feral Spirit into something dangerous again in WoD? They&apos;ve been pretty poor in MoP.<br>
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/423613151947415552))<br>

Imp is crap at doing that, time it take it to switch and start casting, is a lost. Pets should switch instantly<br>
Passion is a great thing. However, I think it may be clouding your view here. For example, Imp&apos;s recast time is zero loss. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/423907898276601856))<br>
You need to recheck your data - I been playing warlock since day 1, and I know for a fact imp is slow at switching.<br>
You&apos;re missing the point; the fact that it takes time to switch doesn&apos;t matter. That time is not lost DPS. Imps use energy. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/423910076177321984))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
Are you going to do something to tailor/trinket/enchant proc stacking in wod? encourages popping evry cd in opener cos procs lineup<br>
Yes. We&apos;ll be reducing the number of stacking procs and cooldowns from a variety of sources. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423904280311906304))<br>
<br>
DPS player wants to try healing for the 1st time: his basic gear changes to Int, but has no Spirit. Awful mana regen. Thoughts?<br>
He needs to get jewelry made for healers. That&apos;s a huge change from today where he needs to get a full set of healing gear. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422844465770795008))<br>
But does it concern you that less informed players may think they&apos;re &quot;ready&quot; for healing once gear conveniently changes to Int?<br>
At worst they try it, go OOM extremely quickly, ask around, or someone tells them, that they should get some Spirit. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/423064938442010625))<br>

Warlords of Draenor Stats<br>
How are old food/gems/chants going to work post stat squish? 300 stat food is massive with ilvl 90 stats.<br>
Stats get squished everywhere, including all of those places you listed. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/423057853427904512))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
can u cut this out in paper for someone whos main language isnt english? I dont get it. Resilience removed in WoD?<br>
In MoP, damage is too high for player health pools so resil lowers damage. In WoD health pools will be relatively bigger. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423184542099197952))<br>
how &quot;relatively&quot;? In Mop it feels like health pools would need to be doubled to keep pace with damage.<br>
Starting point we&apos;re playing with is doubling health, crits are 150% (down from 200%) and healing up 50% (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423232352970502144))<br>
Wonder how that&apos;s gonna fix, going by only health pools it results in slower kills, still spiky as hell dmg/heal.<br>
It&apos;s possible that some damage reduction will have to remain. Point is to minimize it as much as possible. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423188321074831361))<br>
The numbers are just too big right now. It feels crappy to hit a mob for 200k and a player for 40k. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423188585714438144))<br>
less damage, more health and more healing? Maybe if the healers get interruptable again but with less interrupts against dd-caster<br>
The health increase is a lot more than the healing increase. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423254401705197570))<br>
Yes, more health increase then healing increase. But I see no damage increase! Only less crit damage!<br>
little to no resilience is a HUGE damage increase (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423486791937572865))<br>
<br>
Will ALL crits be 150%, or will this just mean stack haste/readi/mastery in pvp?<br>
Current thinking is all crits. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423254518256513024))<br>
<br>
theres a rumor going around that you said 1k is going to be the cutoff this season.... is 1k going to be cutoff?<br>
Yes, we will only be considering players with a rating of 1000 or higher when determining rewards. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423930199835549696))<br>
1000 is the point where players have commit to more than just trying arena. The # of rewards will be similar to past seasons. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423930521186336768))<br>
<br>
what do you think of the idea for separate ratings for different specs?<br>
I would have to give it more thought. My concerns would be confusion and possible exploitation. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423534707129610240))<br>
