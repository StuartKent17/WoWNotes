For those of you who are still waiting for Patch 3.0.2 Public Test Realms, the US Test Realms forums has been cleaned of all posts last night. Just like any other day there isn&apos;t any announcement (for obvious reasons) about anything and the only thing we can do is sit and wait. <br>

<br>
&quot;Server First&quot; Feats of Strength titles removed<br>
We&apos;ve decided to remove the titles for the Realm First Feats of Strength that are associated with reaching level 80. We&apos;ve also removed the titles associated with the Realm First Feats of Strength associated with gaining 450 skill in the professions and secondary skill. Lastly, we&apos;ve removed the title associated with Realm First to accomplish the Northrend Vanguard achievement.<br>
<br>
Realm First boss kill achievements will still grant a title. <br>
<br>
As a side note, Beta characters will retain their titles or end up displaying a broken title. This won&apos;t carry over to the live realms but it is merely a symptom of removing these titles from the game. If we were to do another wipe of the achievement system, the Beta titles would go away. <br>

Will 3.0 bring the 60-70 XP Changes?<br>
The 3.0.2 Content Patch deployed on live servers a few weeks before the release of WotLK will include the change mades to make leveling faster. <br>
Will 3.0 bring the 60-70 XP Changes?<br>
Confirmed.</div></div>
