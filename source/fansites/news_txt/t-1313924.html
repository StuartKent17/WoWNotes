Blue Tweets<br>
World<br>
Don&apos;t you think big reason people stuck in capitals instead of exploring world is absence of LFG and Trade channels?<br>
In Cat? No. They had no need to chat with anyone because they could random queue for all the gear they&apos;d need. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/342527592756281344))<br>
We&apos;d be willing to try a global LFG channel again, but I think you&apos;d be buried in (ahem) anal spells and Chuck Norris jokes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/342527851687464960))<br>
you say in CAT, but all the queues for heroic dungeons and LFR etc are still here. Yes, we have more dailies.<br>
But you can earn things like valor or charms by going out into the world. Dungeons and raids don&apos;t deliver every single reward. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/342531864017395712))<br>
<br>
Disagree. CRZ puts several servers worth of griefers into one zone, causes zone disruption. leveling becomes impossible.<br>
We aim to combine enough realms with CRZ to make each feel full. If there are a lot of folks around, that is kind of the goal. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340956322927362049))<br>
That was the intended and often real experience when more folks were leveling and the pop wasn&apos;t so skewed to max level. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340956447024230400))<br>
<br>
Are you really trying to say that having cross-server 90s camping all low level zones is the intended experience?<br>
That wasn&apos;t what I said. I was remarking that you seemed surprised to have players attack you while leveling on a PvP server. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340909835367358464))<br>
<br>
So GC, the all-faction multi-tap is nice, but i still got an issue (http://i.imgur.com/nxFjPSU.jpg). Could you see a future solution?<br>
We&apos;re not big fans of all-faction tap overall. You should be angry that a Horde tapped your mob! (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339934045674815488))<br>
What about on PVE servers where that just makes it a pointless race? I want to play -with- my peers, not against them.<br>
If you are Alliance, Horde are not your peers. At most you should consider them a tool to be used, then discarded. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339997443359899649))<br>
care to explain why we&apos;re not burning org to the ground and slaughtering orc women and children in 5.4 then?<br>
You can be enemies without resorting to genocide. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340195577415495680))<br>
<br>
Aren&apos;t profession catch-up mechanisms against goal of &quot;making the world feel populated&quot;? Why visit old world if not for AH?<br>
We want players out in the world. That doesn&apos;t have to mean high level characters in low level zones. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339925556697116672))<br>
You want to take away reasons for 90s to visit lowbie zones? Players would be missing out; an excuse like AH gets us to visit.<br>
What we have typically seen up until now is those players just don&apos;t level up their professions. It&apos;s not worth going back. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340000722366115840))<br>
<br>
Many players hate CRZ - are you absolutely sure, game needs it?<br>
Yes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339059169707585536))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
Trivia: Kalgan single-handedly made almost all of the vanilla talent trees. Trivia: Kalgan still leads the team. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339933492509028353))<br>
<br>
why do so many long time players (me included) feel BC was the best xpac even though it was the least accessible?<br>
I suspect because even basic elements of WoW still felt new and shiny then. Even the best things in life aren&apos;t immune from fatigue (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/343806478244786177))<br>
Players say they like a certain expansion, but what Blizzard wants to know is WHY they like that expansion?<br>
True. But often the answer is &quot;Those were the glory days of WoW for me,&quot; which is hard to recreate with just new content. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/343804112720252929))<br>
<br>
He&apos;s worried that the Alliance in 5.4 will just be along for the ride while the Horde gets all the glory.<br>
I understand the concern, but it&apos;s one of those no-win battles for us. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340000995612442624))<br>
Red &amp; Blue are both certain that the other gets special treatment. But as I said, a lil&apos; Red v Blue rivalry aint bad. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340001218942337024))<br>
<br>
with features such as LFR people have a &apos;log on, dailies, LFR, log off&apos; attitude now, this is where I lost my ingame friends<br>
Yeah it&apos;s a tough thing to solve, because that play style works very well with some people&apos;s real life commitments. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338362395456073728))<br>
<br>
Some way to regain the lost sense of server community would help. Right now we only play with guildies and random strangers.<br>
I think that is well put especially the second sentence. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338364018999844865))<br>
<br>
even a &apos;history&apos; of party members would help: &quot;you grouped with X,Y,Z in yesterday&apos;s dungeon and X is online now&quot;<br>
Totally. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338362764701622273))<br>
<br>
Any chance of toning down other players spell effects on boss encounters, or having a setting for that. Can hardly see boss!<br>
Yes. Working on it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337306815824015360))<br>
<br>
Two things that the forum posting / tweeting community tend to overestimate: number of multiboxers, number of players interested in raiding. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/333297545390473216))<br>
Not sure if it&apos;s an echo chamber effect or if posters / tweeters tend to be hardcore or what. Just an observation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/333297774609182720))<br>
<br>
Suit Up collapsed. Exodus collapsed. I&apos;ve been in 3 25 mans this tier, all have collapsed. Please do something.<br>
My understanding was that Exodus did not &quot;collapse&quot; from a 10 v 25 issue. Is that what you&apos;re implying? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335792198442418176))<br>
They&apos;re not collapsing from 10 vs 25 issues. Burnout is happening, less raiders are around and 10s result. Or they disband.<br>
They put in 100s of attempts and demand multiple fully geared alts per player. That&apos;s not something most heroic raiders deal with. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336248433335742464))<br>
it was my understanding in their interview it was their own fault that type of gameplay was too much to bear.<br>
I wasn&apos;t trying to blame them if that was the impression I gave. I think it&apos;s just the natural evolution of the competition. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336600278600138753))<br>
<br>
Curious, After we goto Argus next expac (wink) theres no more wow zones in lore to give us.Redoing old zones the expac future?<br>
You don&apos;t think we can keep whipping continents out of thin air? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335791795730522113))<br>
<br>
Span and Port are diff lang. Why put them both in Chi Data Cntr? US servers there now have to deal w/ 2 lang barriers. Why?<br>
I don&apos;t know in this case. Usually it is to have a large enough group to support matchmaking. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335802686672891905))<br>
<br>
If Players want old school: aka no lfr, flying, w/e, Is worth trying a new realm type for old school? pvp/rp/pve/&quot;classic&quot;.<br>
No LFR and flying wouldn&apos;t be too hard. Going back to old talents, weapon skill, old quests would be very hard. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335800725407928321))<br>
<br>
Voice com. required turns me off. Would love a challenge and not put on headphones,rand-bgs are getting there <br>
Yeah, that&apos;s a tough challenge for gaming in general. Typing is just really slow. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340958956044300290))<br>
<br>
Do you think you should publicly announce when bots have been banned. It will show the system works and might deter botting.<br>
I think the head on a pike strategy can work as a deterrent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335798623822561280))<br>
<br>
SWTOR got random groups correct. It is server based. Server based leads to accountability.<br>
Realm based groups would have a very long queue time, especially on off-peak hours. How long are you willing to wait? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/333299698284773377))<br>
