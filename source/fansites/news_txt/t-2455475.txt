The Night Warrior scenario is a new series of quests that advances the story of the Night Elves after the events of the Burning of Teldrassil.
Tyrande's owl will bring you a message to go to Stormwind Keep.
There, Tyrande tries to convince Anduin to send troops to take back Darkshore, but he tells her to be patient as they can't spare any troops because of the war in Kul Tiras and Zandalar. Tyrande says her people will take back Darkshore without him.
You head to Darkshore, and after a series of quests, find out that Tyrande plans to invoke the ritual of the Night Warrior, which will make her the instrument of Elune' wrath.
You, Shandris Feathermoon, and Maiev Shadowsong search for her through Horde camps while Sira Moonwarden scouts the shore.
You eventually find Tyrande and witness her ascension. She takes you and destroys a Forsaken deathcamp, killing everyone inside except for the leader, Belmont, whom she wants to leave to rot.
The final portion has you, Tyrande, and Malfurion face an army of Forsaken and Nathanos empowered by two of Sylvanas's valkyr.
Nathanos is on the brink of death but one of the valkyr sacrifices herself to save him. The other raises Delaryn Summermoon and Sira Moonwarden who was killed as you arrived.
The Horde flees and you return to Kul Tiras while Tyrande vows to finish this another day.
