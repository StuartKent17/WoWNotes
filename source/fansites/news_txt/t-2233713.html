<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: The net result of the two Combat Potency and Fortune Strikes changes is that Combat Potency should generate half as much Energy, twice as often.<br>
<br>

Roll the Bones<br>
<br>

Subtlety<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: Our overall goals are to remove uncontrolled player teleport from the baseline DPS rotation, to reduce the frequency of teleporting in PvP, to allow players to choose between more frequent or more impactful Shadow Dances, which equates to more frequent CC/utility or damage in PvP, to keep the PvE rotation engaging, and to make Symbols of Death more engaging.<br>
All damage dealt increased by 20%.<br>

<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: This is to balance it against Premeditation, which is now on the same row. It&#x2019;s a buff in a raid setting, where the talent was very weak.<br>
<br>
Master of Shadows (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/196976) now gains 25 Energy over 3 seconds when you enter Stealth or Shadow Dance.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: Pooling energy going into a Shadow Dance has long been the way to play Subtlety, and we&#x2019;d like to bring that back. This design still gives you more energy for a Shadow Dance, but in a way that allows the Rogue to fully utilize pooling gameplay.<br>
<br>

<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: Further pushes Subtlety away from maintaining Nightblade on all secondary targets and instead into focusing their damage into 1 target. Additionally, gives Nightblade a mechanical interaction with the rest of the core rotation that fulfills the &#x201C;setup&#x201D; feel of Subtlety.<br>
<br>

<br>
