On Friday, June 14 at 2:00 p.m. PDT, we&#x2019;ll open a new realm in the WoW Classic Beta for dedicated testing of Alterac Valley.<br>
<br>
When beta testers log into the WoW Classic Beta at that time, please look for the new Field of Strife realm. Alterac Valley will only be available for testing on this realm, and we will be turn off the other beta realms for the duration of the AV test. You&#x2019;ll find that test characters on Field of Strife are confined to their capital cities. Don&#x2019;t worry&#x2014;even if you could leave the city, there will be no enemies, quest-givers, dungeons, or transports throughout the rest of the world.<br>
<br>
On the Field of Strife realm, when you create a character, it will be locked at level 58 for AV testing. These test characters will have appropriate gear, some gold, a mount, and access to class trainers and reagent vendors, but they will not be able to level up past 58.<br>
<br>
Please go to your city&#x2019;s Battlemasters and queue for Alterac Valley as much as you like, and submit your feedback in our dedicated Alterac Valley feedback thread.<br>
<br>
We expect to close the realm and this AV test on Monday, June 17 at about 10:00 a.m PDT. At that time, the other beta realms will return.<br>
<br>
Thank you!</div></div>
