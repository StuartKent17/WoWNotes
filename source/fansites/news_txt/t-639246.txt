The fight takes place in The Clash of Thunder, an arena overwatched by Thorim himself. As you enter the arena you will see a Jormungar Behemoth ~1.2M HP fighting a captured alliance/horde opposing faction team composed of 1 tank, 1 healer, and 3 damage dealers. Killing them is fairly easy, just make sure you take care of the AoE healing from the healer while fighting the NPC and try to avoid the large poison breath while fighting the Jormungar. 

Once the NPCs and the Jormungar are dead, a lot of constructs melee, casters, and healers will jump into the arena from the stands and you will have to handle them with only one part of your raid while Thorim throws Stormhammers at them. He will also randomly activates the lightning orbs surrouding the arena, they will deal strong AoE damage to anyone near as soon as they are activated: run away from them! 

The 2nd part of the raid will have to go through the hallway to the left of the Arena and fight its way to Thorim. This hallways is also full of constructs and will also have you deal with two mini bosses about 5M HP each, you only have 5 minutes to reach Thorim before he goes berserk and kills your raid.

When Thorim is pulled by the hallway team, he will jump into the arena and the last part of the fight will begin. He's got 11M Health Points and hits a well geared tank for 8k damage but will also use two abilities: the first one is an Unbalancing Strike http://thottbot.com/test/s62130 reducing the defense of the tank by 200 for 15 sec 100 for 6 seconds in normal. He will also casts Lightning Charge http://thottbot.com/test/s62279 every 15 seconds, just like with Grull this effect will stack and Thorim will deal more and more damage during the fight. Thanks to Wraith http://wraith-guild.net/ for the help on the description of the fight
