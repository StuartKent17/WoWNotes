Discipline<br>
Is it intended to have multiple Power Word: shields on a player at the same time? i.e. I have PW:S from myself on me. and I have PW:s from a different disc priest on me.<br>
That&apos;s intended. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/398481-discipline-bug-thread/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20419912912?page=2#37))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Why did you take heat as a ret paladin nerfer? They were so faceroll OP in WOTLK pvp.<br>
I often joked about nerfing them and somehow that started being taken seriously. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687650779964911617))<br>
<br>
As worlds in games get bigger, it seems they also become more empty, What can we as players and devs do about this?<br>
Maybe devs have to give players more tools to create their own content. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687650989482983424))<br>
Doesn&apos;t even need to be new art or dungeons. Being able to offer other players quests could be huge. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687651121104461826))<br>
<br>
not sure if you have had a chance to see proposed tank changes to Legion alpha but ur take on it would be appreciated<br>
They make sense to me. Defeating a boss should be a team affair. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687651444799877121))<br>
