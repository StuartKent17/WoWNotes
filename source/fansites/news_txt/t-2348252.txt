Patch 7.3.5 - Artifact Weapon Ending
During Blizzcon, Blizzard hinted that our artifact weapons were going to get a proper send-off and not continue into the next expansion. We have been able to find hints of just how this will play out. The following dialogue contains spoilers!

Magni Bronzebeard: The sword of Sargeras is poisonin' the very lifeblood of the world. The only vessels capable o' containin' that kind o' power... are the mighty weapons you wield. Raise them up as one.... draw out the corruption from the Dark Titan's blade! Together, champions! For Azeroth!


Patch 7.3.5 - The Nighthold
The uninstanced version of the Nighthold  has seen some changes on the PTR, becoming more of a small faction hub. Both Alliance and Horde can visit as of now. There are teleport stations that lead to Dalaran  and Orgrimmar  usable by the Horde as well as all of your favorite characters from the Suramar campaign, such as Thalyssra  and Theryn  Pandaren monks have also arrived to teach the Nightborne the ways of the  Monk class.


      
      
      



Patch 7.3.5 -Thunder Totem
While most of the Bloodtotem tribe became corrupted by the Legion, the few who did not have now sought refuge at Thunder Totem  On top of this, Pandaren monks have arrived to teach the Highmountain Tauren the ways of the  Monk class.


        



Patch 7.3.5 - Antorus Instanced Vindicaar
Not much is changed between the raid instance version of the Vindicaar and the one you visit daily. All of the champions involved in the campaign except Illidan  are now standing together and have new dialogue to address their thoughts now that the Legion is finally defeated. There is also a fully functional Netherlight Crucible that can be teleported to and used during the raid once you can skip to Argus and defeat him first. The skybox has also been updated to show the vastness of space and some void infected planets.


    



Patch 7.3.5 - New Command Boards
The command boards in Orgrimmar  and Stormwind  have received visual upgrades on top of a new UI. They use the same menu now that we used to choose our artifact weapons to pursue and your options change as you level up. You also get a small picture and a brief description of the zone and what the story will contain.


        



Patch 7.3.5 - Silithus
The area around the sword in Silithus has also been changed. Azerite nodes have appeared, Horde and Allinace areas have been added, and the ground is no longer red.
