So I crafted a lego prior to 7.2.5 and it has iLVL 970. I wish to sell it on AH, how do I make it 1000 iLVL?<br>
The impression that Legendaries could go to item level 1000 was a bug in the Dungeon Journal. At this time, item level 970 is the maximum. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/888130876642545665))<br>

Why has there been no official word regarding the Priest class mount trail effect nerf? Can we compromise? Miss the feathers!<br>
We removed only a few feathers* that were reaching the player camera. *per the artist, these aren&apos;t &quot;feathers&quot;, but &quot;magical owl dander&quot;. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/887795204492845058))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Purely design wise, what was your favorite WoW class to work on?<br>
Death knight, no question. It was just a blank slate, so we felt free to challenge every idea, rather than having a few years of built up expectations and history to contend with. I don&#x2019;t mean to sound like those factors should be dismissed - far from it. It was just nice to start from very little. A death knight needs a sword, and there&#x2019;s something about it being cold, and whatever abilities the character had in War3. That was about it.<br>
<br>
If that feels like a cop-out answer, then my next one is probably warrior. I always enjoyed how the WoW warrior felt like a mix between a soldier and a gladiator (and a bit of barbarian). It was fun to work with the rage mechanic, even when it could be really frustrating to tune sufficiently.
