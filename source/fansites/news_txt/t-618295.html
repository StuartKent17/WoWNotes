Minor patch to be released after Patch 3.0.2<br>
The items checked to complete the C&apos;thun kill achievement have been updated ... Not interesting enough ? Well, Tigole also mentionned that this achievement is getting fixed in a patch deployed after the upcoming one. Patch 3.0.2 is still expected to be released next week (but not officialy confirmed in any way for the moment) and we&apos;ll probably see Patch 3.0.3 deployed shortly after. <br>
We just added the C&apos;Thun BP&apos;s to the retro list. Previously, we were checking the quests but the quests were not recorded because they are repeatable.<br>
<br>
This fix won&apos;t go in the upcoming patch but one that will follow that patch by a week or two. So hang on to those C&apos;Thun BP&apos;s and you&apos;ll get credit. <br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/warrior.jpg Upcoming Warrior Changes<br>
Arms: We are going to change Sudden Death to be based on a chance per hit and not a chance per crit. That shouldn&apos;t adversely affect their dps, but will also hopefully keep them from stacking nothing but crit. We do want to see warriors with swords and maces after all.<br>
<br>
Fury: We are lowering the cooldown on Bloodthirst to 5 sec (from 6) and lowering the penalty on Titan&apos;s Grip to 12% (from 15%). Our hope is that with more BTs and more yellow hits connecting that the excess rage will drain away. The net dps increase will also help Fury catch up to Arms.<br>
<br>
I understand that many of you suggested a new attack for Fury. That is a pretty major change so we want to make sure it&apos;s needed (for Lich King ship -- we could always add it as a later patch). We would need to reorganize the tree, adjust trainers, perhaps change other talents to affect it, perhaps change glyphs, and all of that assumes we get the numbers close on the first attempt. More than likely it would take a lot of iteration. So, it&apos;s still on the table, but it&apos;s a last resort for now and something we will definitely consider at a later date. <br>

Blue posts<br>
Cold-Weather flying not required to level up at higher levels<br>
This is not true. You are not required to have Cold Weather Flying to complete leveling in the 77-80 zones. If you do not have Cold Weather Flying, you will get a &quot;loaner mount&quot; that will permit you to complete leveling in the zones. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10972109095-first-time-ever-leveling-requires-gold-sink.html))<br>
<br>
Hallow&apos;s end changes<br>
The event has been updated slightly. It did not receive a major overhaul but we polished some aspects of the event and added some new things. <br>
You won&apos;t have to exit Scarlet Monastery, reset the instance and then re-enter for each attempt you take on the Headless Horseman. <br>
Broom mounts will be back (they still have a duration, so you&apos;ll only see them during Hallow&apos;s End). They work differently this year. There is only one &quot;broom&quot; mount and anyone can use it. It moves at whatever riding skill speed you have. If you don&apos;t have any riding skill, it moves at run speed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10972069731-halloween-event.html))<br>
<br>
Hallow&apos;s End starting date<br>
To clear this up right now: Hallow&apos;s End begins on October 18th at 4:00AM server time and will end on November 1st at 4:00AM server time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10971859278-halloween-events.html))<br>

Reasons behind the Motorcycle<br>
We added these because we thought they were cool. Cool is a very subjective concept. If some people don&apos;t want to ride a motorcycle, that&apos;s all good -- there are plenty of other mounts for them. Conceptually, they fit in perfectly considering Engineering is a profession which players can pursue. Between Goblin and Gnome technology, there is already a precedent for this type of engineering in the game. Shredders, mechano-striders, flying machines, siege tanks, etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10972108525-whats-the-reasoning-behind-the-motorcycle.html))<br>

Eclipse<br>
I have followed a lot of the Eclipse number crunching. Here are things I think are valid concerns:<br>
Is 10 sec too short to get your spells off?<br>
Is increasing a random chance good for Starfire? Over time, it should still work out to an increase, especially given other crit benefits. But you could proc Eclipse and not get a crit, or &quot;waste&quot; a crit on one you would have already gotten one.<br>
<br>
Here are things I don&apos;t believe are valid concerns:<br>
The RNG or proc-watching aspects. This was exactly the design. If you want a very stable rotation and aren&apos;t RNG tolerant, I absolutely would skip over this talent. We wanted it to be optional to some extent -- this is why it isn&apos;t the next-to-last 5 point talent (though yours isn&apos;t 5 points now anyway). Some players like to be rewarded for really paying attention to procs, or get really bored casting the same spells over and over according to a pre-determined rotation.<br>
<br>
Now, one mistake I do see in some (not all) of the math is assuming that Eclipse will proc as soon as the previous one ends. With a 30 sec cooldown, the real cooldown will probably be closer to 38-40 sec. Keep cranking. It&apos;s certainly possible our math is off.

Ferocious Inspirations raid-wide confirmed<br>
Yes, it is supposed to be raid-wide. Fixed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10971928367-ferocious-inspiration-raidwide.html))<br>
<br>
Aspect of the Viper / Haste bonus on gear<br>
Couple of follow-ups:<br>
On Viper: Letting it proc off melee auto attacks and specials is probably something we could do (this was mentioned up above). That may not solve all of your mana problems, but it might help when someone gets up in your stuff.<br>
On Haste: I know our item budget is a little cryptic, and to some extent we like it that way. However, if we removed any haste from your items, we would have to replace it with something else that is probably equally sub-optimal. It&apos;s a &quot;B stat&quot; for hunters if you will. We can&apos;t just peel off haste and replace it with say Agi or AP (or if we did, the total would be a lot lower) or the item would be over-budget.
