Dungeons and Raids

Quest Items related to Karazhan attunement now drop in Mythic Keystone dungeons in addition to Mythic difficulty dungeons.


Game Client

Work in progress Sheathing and unsheathing a weapon should no longer cause the game to crash.


PvP

Warden Towers temporarily rewarded 150 Honor. They have been convinced to once again reward 300 Honor.
Honor rewards from Tol Barad have been reduced by 50%.
Class Adjustments

Relentless reduces crowd control duration by 20% was 25%.

Developers’ Notes: We feel Relentless is over-represented in a lot of situations, so we’re slightly reducing its effect.

Fire Stamina reduced by 10% in PvP.
Frost Stamina reduced by 10% in PvP

Developers’ Notes: Fire and Frost Mages have felt a bit too tanky.

Frost Deep Shatter increases the damage of Frostbolt by 150% was 200%.

Mistweaver Surge of Mist now causes Enveloping Mist to incur an 8 second cooldown was 6 seconds.

Developers’ Notes: Mistweavers Monks have often relied on Soothing Mist to do most of their healing. Now, when choosing Surge of Mist, you may have to cast another healing spell during the Enveloping Mists cooldown.


Mistweaver Counteract magic increases the healing of Renewing Mist by 125% was 150%.

Developers’ Notes: Counteract Magic has felt a bit too strong against damage-over-time compositions.

Discipline Searing Light increases the damage of Smite by 15%, down from 30%.

Developers’ Notes: The Discipline Priest is intended to be an offensive healer, but we feel they were over-performing in 2v2 Arena.

Agility reduced by 10% in PvP.
Stamina reduced by 5% in PvP.

Developers’ Notes: Rogues are intended to be strong, yet vulnerable to focused-fire. We feel they have too much survivability while dealing too much damage with both utility and survivability, so we’re toning them down.


Assassination System Shock duration reduced to 2 seconds was 4 seconds.
Subtlety Stamina reduced by 5% in PvP.
Assassination, Outlaw Stamina reduced by 15% in PvP.

Bladestorm now deals full damage in PvP situations.

Developers’ Notes: Bladestorm is intended to be a strong damage cooldown for the Arms Warrior. In Legion Beta testing, Arms Warriors felt too strong, so we reduced the damage Bladestorm did in PvP. We feel we’re back to a place where returning it to full damage makes sense.


Execute now deals 15% more damage in PvP situations.

Developers’ Notes: Execute is designed to be a signature strength of the Warrior, and should always be the right choice on targets within Execute range in PvP. We’ve found that there are some situations where that wasn’t true, so we’re increasing the damage of Execute to make it always the right choice.





Quests

Players should no longer fail to get credit for completing world boss World Quests.
Players with a full inventory should now be able to complete “Edict of the God-King” and accept “Unwanted Evidence” after defeating God-King Skovald in Halls of Valor.
The quest drops for “Uncovering Orders” should now come from the final boss in each of the three named dungeons, Assault on Violet Hold, Black Rook Hold, and Vault of the Wardens.


World

Bloodgazer Falcosaurs should now respawn more quickly.



Blue Posts
EU Forums
Just to be clear; I was talkingthe disinterest and malice part about the seperation of english speakers and english speakers within the wow community. I personally think the label malice here is justified ever since we got a glimpse of how the devs culture's view on the eu community; we're face palming picard monkeys with no possibility for worthwhile insights- we should be kept in our cages well clear from the 'always constructive' us forums. if you missed it, our current Game Director's views on the EU community can be seen here in a fun 10th anniversary celebratory video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d3M6N5vMoQ&feature=youtu.be&t=51m12s . A sentiment that is judging by the utter lack of developers ever visiting these forums still present.
I'm going to respectfully disagree with you here. In that clip, Ion is comparing US and EU feedback threads on the same topic - and you even see the Picard ASCII he's scrolling past in the EU thread. While I understand that people have the pereception that their feedback isn't valued here, I feel it's a huge stretch to take that one example and claim it's how the entire EU community is viewed. The seconds after that section even go on to explain how feedback is integral to the raid design process. Furthermore, Ion even elaborated on that clip here.

Ion still posts feedback threads for all the raid testing for both the beta and PTR, something he'd hardly take the time to do if the team didn't care. During the course of the Legion beta he replied to threads on both the EU and US forums and more recently, he has even shared details on the EU forum first.

As for disinterest? Not on Aerythleas part, surely, but from blizzard as a whole I think that's a fair assessement , both myself http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17612252191?page=1  and many others have made many a post without a reply. Now I know this is the communication policy, but seeing the breath and scope of the posts I find saying theres a disinterest in this subject more than fair.

We / I simply want to talk about wow things, it's what unites us on these forums and it frustrates me and judging by the amount of posts others aswell that we're limited in this for archaic reasons we have to think up ourselves.
The request to merge the EU and US forums is one I see quite a lot of, the reality is I don't have a good answer to provide right now. 

The purpose of the EU forums is to provide a platform for European players to discuss the game with each other, which allows us to gather European feedback and sentiment. While on some topics, the feedback being voiced on both EU and US is pretty similar, there are also cases where one region has reacted far more strongly to something than the other. If the forums were merged, this would be harder to differentiate when we construct our internal reports, and we have to consider how to adapt these processes accordingly.

There is also the matter of service related topics. The US forum already has separate sections for the Oceanic portion of their subscriber base. If the EU subscribers were added to this, we'd still be looking at having separate EU General Discussion and Recruitment sections, as well as separate EU and US service support forums which could make it even harder for non-forum regulars to track down information in times of technical problems if that's the only time they check the forum. The alternative is; do we restructure our forum support teams to be global? This brings with it a whole new set of factors such as: Will this require new tools? Can we provide coverage with our current workforce or will that need to be reviewed? Are there any regional variances in policy that might cause roadblocks? etc.

Furthermore, there are technical considerations on the back-end a small example, but by no means the only hurdle: how to make a clear differentiation in cases where EU and US share server names and there's a character of the same name on both servers? as well as subtle cultural differences to consider. Then we also have to think about what this is going to require in terms of resources from our web teams. Will we just do a 1-for-1 exchange and merge EU general with US general, EU Class forums into US Class forums and the resulting mess that would likely need to be cleaned up or put the EU forum into some sort of read-only archive mode for example.

Even then, despite seeing requests for this merge, we do also see people asking for such a merge not to happen. If any solution is decided upon, we'd want it to be the best fit possible and leaving things as is, is one potential solution.

I guess the TL;DR here is: This isn't even an exhaustive list of all the factors and variables - it's not a simple case of flicking a switch and it happens.

Any idea why the petition on the US Death Knight thread got closed within a few hours, but the same thread on the EU Death Knight forums is still up, weeks later?
I agree I should've locked it by now, but I let it keep ticking over as there was some very useful feedback coming out of it.

EU Site - Patch 7.1 Notes
Only ones sleeping is blizzard, its 2016.. Its a bloody forum.. Why would they keep same language speakers divided, its beyond stupid.. Or as i said, pure disinterest or malice.

Also, patchnotes would be up by now if that was the problem!
The patch isn't live in Europe yet, ergo, the patch notes aren't on the European site. You can spin it as "disinterest and malice" all you want, but that's far from the reality:

Not every WoW player in Europe frequents the forums, or even fan-sites, and putting patch-notes up the day before which we've done in the past can and did cause confusion when players login to find the patch isn't actually live yet.
