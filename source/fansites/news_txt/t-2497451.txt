PvP Brawl - Classic Ashran
This week's brawl is the epic battleground Ashran in its original form.
Why ashran for the brawl?
assume the “win condition” for the quest is 4 event wins and an enemy general kill?
We’re working on a hotfix that will make the “Something Different” quest complete in the Classic Ashran brawl when you either win any event, or kill Grand Marshal Tremblade / High Warlord Volrath.


Island Expeditions for Week of July 16th, 2019

Snowblossom Village with Virmen



Conflict and Strife Rank 2 Acquisition Hotfix
The tool tip for Conflict and Strife says that you need to get conquest cap to get rank one and for rank two you need 1k rating. I hit 1k rating before getting conquest cap so shouldn’t that allow me to skip straight to rank two?

I pose this question because I only got rank one in my pvp chest and from my perspective it’s an error.
Correct. We had a bug, and we’ve now hotfixed it. We’re working to address the issue for players who already opened it. Thank you!
