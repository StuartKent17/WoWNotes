chaud2018-03-12, 03:05 AMBattle for Azeroth Allied Races - Mag'har Orcs Preview
These brown skinned orcs are likely a collection of the broken clans from Alternate Draenor after the events of Warlords of Draenor who are united under Grom Hellscream. It is unclear how they come back into play for Battle for Azeroth, but they are likely to be an Allied Race for the Horde and feature the option for an unhunched posture.


    
 


Unlocking the Mag'har Orcs
It is still unknown how to unlock the Mag'har Orc Allied Race


Classes
The Mag'har Orcs Allied Race can be any of these classes:


 Shaman
All other classes are currently unknown.



Racials
Mag'har Orc racials are currently unknown.


Mounts
The Mag'har Orc racial mount is the Mag'har Direwolf 


Native to Draenor, these wolves are preferred by the Mag'har for their ferocity, loyalty, and for something to snuggle on those cool winter nights.

 



Heritage Armor
If you level to 110 without a boost, you will be awarded with the heritage armor.


  



Jokes, Flirts, and VO
We currently only have a limited amount of flirts and jokes for the Mag'har Orcs datamined.
Female
You don't need a Dark Portal... you've already invaded my heart.
Any idea if Saurfang is single? He's got that silver fox thing going on...
A green orc gave me a candy heart that said "I fel for you." I told him he could keep his demon's blood and clobbered him with my mace.
Last person to hit on me learned what "hitting on" really means.
A Bleeding Hollow shaman just flirted with me. At least, I think he did. Either he was winking suggestively or he had just sacrificed an eye.
Just because I'm enjoying your company doesn't mean I don't also want to punch you.
Before we go any further, I need to know... How high is your pain threshold?

Hey... aren't you the one who left that abandoned garrison littering up Frostfire?
Azeroth has so many rules about who you can stab, who you can't stab... who you can punch, who you can't punch... You guys need to loosen up!
The Shattered Hand are legendary warriors, but don't ever ask one of them for a back rub. Trust me on this one... < pained sounds >
Enough of this wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey... BLAH! Just let me smash stuff!
I dyed my hair green once. Warchief Hellscream was NOT amused.
You can call me uncorrupted, but I prefer to think of myself as an organic orc.
Drahnor. Draynor? Draanur. Draenor. < Sigh >. I'm just gonna say I'm from Outland.

Male
Is your mother a fire elemental? Because you are smokin' hot!
Care to take a walk with me in the Shadowmoonlight?
Baby, I'm gonna Blackrock your world.
You're not just good looking... you're mok'gora-gous!
My safe word is "zug-zug".
I'm a sensitive guy. Please don't break my mag'heart.
You must be a Frostwolf, because you've made tracks to my heart.

I never met Gul'dan, but I hear he was a nightmare at parties. Always trying to spike the punch bowl...
Azeroth goes through warchiefs like Draenor goes through alternate timelines.
The Laughing Skull clan booed me off the stage at the comedy club. With a name like that, you'd think they'd have a sense of humor!
Try spending a few decades trapped on a planet with fanatical draenei and see how YOU like it!
Ahhhhhh! The chiropractor in Orgrimmar has done wonders for my back.
Stay frosty, my wolves.
My favorite kind of music? Blackrock n' Roll, of course! < guitar sounds >
