All About Points
This is a great year for esports and a big year for World of Warcraft. The new points system allows us to spread tournaments consistently throughout the year, which keeps up the momentum and excitement— from the tournament all the way to the Championship. Don’t forget, the top 12 teams are the ones who earn their place in the Championship.

All About Rosters

Didn’t finish in the top 6 in the first tournament? Not a problem! Teams can change their team members as often as they want, until points are earned. Once you have points on the board, your teams are set in stone. Well, except. . .
Teams who earn points are allotted one roster swap without consequences.
After the free swap, there is an automatic 50% reduction to your points tally.
If you want to know more, you should definitely read the official rules below.

We’re excited to partner-up with GCDTV, who will be helping us out with all that has to happen behind the scenes which is a lot.

Want To Run Your Own Tournament?
We would love to see more of these! The more community involvement the better and there are some seriously solid reasons for doing it. Community-run tournaments directly impact which teams end up in the Arena World Championships, as all approved community-run events award points.

If you have any questions about running your own event, get in touch WoWEsportsAdmin@Blizzard.com. We’re here to help and want you to create as many buzzing community events as it’s possible to have.


Raid Testing Schedule - March 24
On Friday, March 24, we will be conducting raid testing of Heroic Tomb of Sargeras bosses.

Friday, March 24

Demonic Inquisition - Heroic Tomb of Sargeras
11:00 PST 14:00 EST, 20:00 CET

Maiden of Vigilance - Heroic Tomb of Sargeras
12:00 PST 15:00 EST, 21:00 CET

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.

Feedback
Changes may will not happen immediately, but "got a new spell/buffed spell and really liked it" is a great basis for feedback Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/842559588461236224

I think "I love this legendary bonus and it should be baseline" is great feedback and keep it up everyone Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/842558869624700928

Lore
are infernals considered elementals?
We consider them demons in both WoW and Hearthstone, despite the stony complexion. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/842760166273515520

Legendary Bad Luck Protection - Follower Items
Just dropping in so there's a Blue post to reference in the future:

Follower Legendaries do not have any impact on the bad luck protection for your character and won't affect the chances of obtaining your next Legendary.

Reap Souls Resetting
Thanks for all the feedback. Details will be forthcoming, but we do want to do something to help Tormented Soul generation near the start of encounters wherever the new resetting takes place. It's still important that the resources at the start of an encounter be somewhat standardized, but we understand that starting at 0 and not being able to use Reap Soul during your opening burst isn't a timing that feels great for that ability.
