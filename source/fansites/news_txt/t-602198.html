Tuesday ! You know what it means ! Your weekly update about the 2.2 release date !<br>
Not tomorrow.<br>
A more detailed answer is &quot;when the tester-reported defect/error rate drops below accepted measures based on past experience with Live and PTR builds, as well as passing internal test checklists&quot;. <br>
<br>
Current 2.2.0 builds are very close to this goal. <br>
<br>
2.3 already tested<br>
It seems that the 2.2 veeeeery long testing time was also used to test the 2.3 patch a lot more. One more step to a fast 2.3 release ? <br>
Good question, and yes development continues on all future content despite the lengthy testing period 2.2 has required. It&apos;s actually allowed more changes and testing to occur on the patches following 2.2 before they even see the PTR. It&apos;s still less than an ideal situation, and we&apos;re doing our best to release the patch as soon as we can.<br>
<br>
Daze in 2.2<br>
They planned to change the mechanics of the Daze effect in 2.2, but they thought about it and concluded that it would make tons of tank very sad, change reverted.<br>
A change to the &#x201C;Daze&#x201D; mechanic was originally planned for introduction in patch 2.2. This change would have removed additional defense rating as a factor in reducing the chance of being dazed, equalizing the chance for heavy armor wearers to become dazed as compared to light armor wearers. With further testing and discussion it was decided that players would be too negatively affected in their ability to tank and reposition their targets, and this change will no longer be included with 2.2. We currently have no plans to reintroduce this change at a later time. <br>
<br>
Rogues combo points<br>
Blizzard isn&apos;t opposed to the idea of letting rogues keeping their combo points when switching from one target to another. <br>
Allowing the rogue to keep combo points independent of the target is actually something we&apos;ve considered for some time. If and/or when it would be implemented is still to be decided, but we&apos;re certainly not opposed to the idea.<br>
<br>
Reagents for blinding powder and vanish<br>
Removing them isn&apos;t excluded. <br>
Q: Either remove Blinding Powder reagent cost from Blind and the game, or have vendors sell Blinding Powder for the same price as Flash Powder.<br>
A: Your comments hold merit, and have been noted.<br>
<br>
Warriors and Death Knights<br>
Death Knights aren&apos;t here to replace warriors, they&apos;re just here to steal their loots give players more options for what they need to complete their group. <br>
Right now we have several options for classes that can heal, dps, or tank and all of them are playing alongside one another very well so I believe Death Knights and Warriors will &quot;coexist&quot; just fine. I can&apos;t see having both of them in a group and just constantly dueling because they refuse to do so. <br>
<br>
By adding another dps/tanking class, the Death Knight will give players and groups more options for what they need to complete their objective(s).<br>
<br>
Elekk/Hawkstriders PvP mounts<br>
Still planned, but not for taurens. As usual, screenshot of the mounts available here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/june/newmountspvp.jpg)<br>
We do plan to add the Elekk and Hawkstrider mounts as PvP rewards in a future patch. For clarification, as Taurens can&apos;t use the in-game Hawkstriders, I would not expect them to be able to use the PvP version. This has not been finalized though and we will have to wait for the mount to be implemented for further details.<br>
<br>
Haste rating changes in 2.2<br>
Drysc explains why Haste rating got nerfed, which let me use once again the nice haste change comparison (with a better layout this time)<br>
I&apos;ll try to answer in my own words, I know this has been a large complaint from the rogue community and I&apos;ve only just recently gained information about the reasoning for the change myself. <br>
<br>
Our baseline melee stat is Attack Power, it&apos;s the stat that we use as a benchmark in which we compare all other melee stats. Haste was at about a 1:1 in relation to AP at base levels, and it scales a whole lot better. So in large quantities haste was easily overcoming AP, and trouncing all other melee stats. While it&apos;s not bad for it to be a strong stat, we don&apos;t want it to become THE stat over AP. In fewer words it&apos;s a quintessential nerf: it was too good. <br>
<br>
In the caster case, it was difficult for us to judge just how haste would affect casts as it varies so dramatically from player to player, class to class, and even spec to spec. Originally when it was nerfed we were sort of anticipating it being required, but we&apos;re just not seeing the large use of sustained cast-time oriented spells we thought we would, and it&apos;s being brought back up to compensate.<br>

Paladins<br>
There is also a huge post (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=771470160&amp;pageNo=2&amp;sid=1#24) by Tharfor concerning paladins, there isn&apos;t really any information in it but I guess it&apos;s nice if you like paladin discussions.</div></div>
