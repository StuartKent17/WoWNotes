During one of the latest PTR Build (I don&apos;t know how old this is to be honest, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s been reported yet), items from the season 4 got their stats changed. <br>
The ilvl of the only known weapon, the Brutal Gladiator&apos;s Greatsword (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/brutalgladgreatswordv2.jpg) (Old stats (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/brutalgladiatorgreatsword.jpg)) had its ilvl reduced from 159 to 154. The DPS and a few stats have been lowered. <br>
The armor on the only known set, the Brutal Gladiator&apos;s Vindication (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/brutalgladvindicationv2.jpg) (Old stats (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/brutalgladiatorvindication.jpg)) has been increased !<br>

Rogues - Shiv bug<br>
I&apos;ve spoken with the devs and shiv not being missed or dodged is a bug and was never intended. The changes to the combat log revealed some problems with how this spell is coded and it is being worked on.<br>
