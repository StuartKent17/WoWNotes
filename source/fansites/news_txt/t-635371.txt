Boubouille2009-02-21, 12:47 AMUpdate 03:15 CEST - Forums are available once again. 
Update 02:15 CEST - That was fast, it seems that the forums are now closed. Probably because of all the people complaining about the patch not being available yet. We'll probably see them again once the patch is released ... Soon?

Patch 3.1 - Test Realm Forums now open
This is looking good, the US Test Realm Forums http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?forumId=11572 are now available! You won't hear me say that patch 3.1 is tonight yet, but it's definitely looking good.

Anyway, PTR servers will be available very soon.
Well, my point in the last couple of post I've made is to say that I can't give a straight answer, not because I've been instructed not to, but because we don't have a definite ETA right now. The process to get them running is under way, and we're shooting to get them up asap.
