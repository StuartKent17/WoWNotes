Silas Darkmoon claims to have spared no expense in finding the most wondrous wonders around as he presents the wonderful Darkmoon Faire. Beginning this Sunday, March 1, the Faire returns to Azeroth with a new racing series, new rewards and achievements, and a couple of updates to the games you’ve come to know and love.

Off to the New Races
Starting on March 1, the Darkmoon Faire will unveil the first part of a new racing challenge to thrill and delight players of all sorts.

Win yourself the new Attraction Sign, and point it at your favorite things.

Head down to the boardwalk and get started by accepting the quest ‘Welcome to the Darkmoon Races’. You’ll learn how to race all over the countryside around the Darkmoon Faire, avoiding obstacles and using any tools and tricks you can to finish the course in the fastest time possible.

Only the quickest racers will qualify for the achievements and rewards that come with them. Along the way, you’ll want to use speed boosts, springboards, and a very careful aim all while avoiding boundaries which have been juiced up with a powerful stun.

The Fire-Eater’s Vial is the perfect reward if you’ve always wanted to make fire with your face.

This is but the first of several racing activities to come. When the Faire returns in April, a second race, new achievements, and associated rewards will be added to the first set. We expect Silas to keep adding twists and turns in future months until he has all of Azeroth running around his island:


March: ‘The Real Race’, including the Racing Strider racer and a set of achievements with rewards.
April: ‘The Real Big Race’, including a new Rocketeer racer, more boosts and race buffs, and new achievements for beating the The Real Big Race with both racers.
May: A new Wanderluster racer, new achievements for beating both races with the Wanderluster, and rewards.
June: A new Powermonger racer, new achievements for beating both races with the Powermonger, and rewards.

That’s right, friends! The new Everlasting Darkmoon Firework can be yours.

Updates are Best Dates
From now on, the Tonk Commander game no longer has a maximum of 30 hits. You can now go for as many hits as possible in one minute, and scoring 45 hits earns you the ‘Ace Tonk Commander’ achievement and the new Darkmoon Tonk Controller toy.

Ring Toss has also been updated. The target turtle has gotten trickier than he used to be, and the rings are smaller, but winning will just take some practice on your part. It might take a lot of practice, but you’ll want to give it a shot, since ten rings in a row earns you the new ‘Triumphant Turtle Tossing’ achievement and the Darkmoon Ring-Flinger toy. It’s an explosion of rings from your victorious hands.

Don’t Forget the Heirlooms
Silas asked us to remind everyone that beautiful selections of Heirloom items are available to make your very own, for only a few Darkmoon Prize Tickets each. With the introduction of the new Heirloom collection system in patch 6.1, there’s no reason to not come play the games of the Faire and get closer to earning yourself that Chauferred Chopper!

Step right up! The next Darkmoon Faire runs March 1 – March 8, and will return again on April 5.

Patch 6.1 - Darkmoon Faire Changes
Along with the addition of a race, there are a few other changes and additions to the faire:


The ring toss game https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNcVSYxLyoc was changed to reward http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9894-triumphant-turtle-tossing Darkmoon Ring-Flinger http://www.wowdb.com/items/122123-darkmoon-ring-flinger. The game is now easy to do, as the turtle always runs back to the same spot in the center. Just wait for him to reach an edge and toss the ring at the center. 
The tonks game now rewards http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9885-ace-tonk-commander Darkmoon Tonk Controller http://www.wowdb.com/items/122122-darkmoon-tonk-controller. This is very hard to complete if you are the only one playing, as there aren't enough targets. It is also hard to complete if there is any signficant lag.
You can purchase heirlooms http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-sold-currency=515&filter-patch=19445&filter-ilvl-min=85&filter-ilvl-max=85, heirloom upgrades http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-sold-currency=515&filter-patch=19445&filter-ilvl-min=90&filter-ilvl-max=90, and a Music Roll: Darkmoon Carousel http://www.wowdb.com/items/122238-music-roll-darkmoon-carousel with Darkmoon Tickets.

Patch 6.1 - Archaeology Progress Fix
Hi everyone. We’ve just received an update from our development team informing us that this fix may not be applied to all affected players immediately after the launch of 6.1. We will be rolling it out gradually over time so that we can monitor results and ensure that everything is working as it should. So, if you’re still missing your progression when you login after patch 6.1, don’t panic! We haven’t forgotten about you and will be working to fix your affected characters as soon as possible.

Thanks again for your patience.

Plz tell me Horde Ashran mid GY bug is fixed in 6.1. Corpse running constantly just to rez is REALLY annoying!
Believe so. What have you experienced? holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/568630776209625088
it destroys forward progress.Has something to do with GY changing hands and/or going neutral.H & A flags displayed 2.
I know we tried to fix it. Have you seen it recently? holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/568659079020867584

2v2 is a lot more popular than 3v3, despite having basically no support from Blizzard.
General trend that If an activity rewards the same gear but requires less people, it will be more popular. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/569181832278728704
That "popularity" doesn't mean it's a better experience. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/569182009005723648

Garrisons
If I swap out Trade Post w/AH Bot for Inn, swap back later and rebuild to lvl 3, will I have to redo the AH Bot quest?
You would not need to redo the quest. = WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/568886176519557120

will you still get player kill credit for the nemesis quest line for glad sanctum when in a raid group in 6.1?
.Yes, the Gladiator’s Sanctum quests are flagged to allow progress in a raid group. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/568925839426875393
