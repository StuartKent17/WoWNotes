Armory Stats - Garrison Followers<br>
We are taking a look at an often requested topic, garrison stats. Unfortunately the Battle.Net API doesn&apos;t give us any garrison specific information, so all we can look at is achievements. You can always give this post a thumbs up (http://us.battle.net/en/forum/topic/15270937621#1) to show your interest in having garrison data in the API though!<br>
<br>
We are continuing with follower data today, looking at 2.7 million players and 4.4 million characters. Keep in mind that the 20 x Level 100 Follower (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9129-filling-the-ranks) achievement unlocks the War Mill / Bunker blueprints.<br>

Choluna and Thisalee Crow Followers<br>
QA has finished testing a hotfix that will provide the Choluna or Thisalee Crow follower NPC to players who previously completed the quest &quot;Primal Fury&quot;. If you had completed the quest last week and didn&apos;t receive the follower, you should receive the follower as soon as you login once realms have been restarted. Restarts for US realms are currently scheduled for tomorrow at 5am PST. I&apos;m happy to announce that just like any other follower, Choluna and Thisalee Crow have a chance to roll as rare or epic when you recruit them.<br>
<br>
Players who have not yet completed Primal Fury will receive Choluna or Thisalee Crow as soon as they complete the quest, in addition to the other rewards.<br>
<br>
Apologies for any inconvenience caused over the last week. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/359235-no-thisalee/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15699466503?page=28#560))<br>

Amplify Magic doesn&apos;t affect glyph of regenerative ice heals or the cold snap heal. Have reported this for about a month.<br>
This is intended. % heals aren&apos;t increased. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/555859111305170944))<br>

how do you see Seraphim ever being viable again after this tier when it doesn&apos;t scale?<br>
This is a common misconception. It totally does scale. Check out Theck&apos;s theorycrafting. Static ratings don&apos;t &quot;not scale&quot;. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/555907364771995649))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
With the new heirloom tab include BoA items, such as those from Archeology in Pandaria?<br>
We feel like it would muddy the waters of the system. The Heirloom tab is only for items that scale with character level. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/555955219574452224))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Frustrating in progression wipes to wait for 3 minute CD&apos;s. Any chance we can get those to reset on wipe ?<br>
This is definitely a topic of discussion on our end. Appreciate the feedback! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/555905987597459456))<br>

PvP<br>
Have you realised that you have basically killed any form of competitive PvP?<br>
Quite the contrary, I expect this year to be one of the best for competitive PvP. Stay tuned! (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/556139803633135617))<br>

hello friend, I am curious as to if challenger/rival/duelist/gladiator titles are still available from 5v5, I mever saw a blue post<br>
Hello friend. Those titles will only be given out in the 3v3 bracket this season. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/556206783300378624))<br>

Dev Communication<br>
Just want&apos;d to offer a late thank you for the communication you did with players while working for blizzard. Appreciated <br>
Talking to players is one of the most rewarding parts of my job. Wish more devs and their managers understood that. (Ghostcrawler)<br>
Please pass this on to he seems to have a phobia of talking to the PvP community<br>
Team has gone in a different direction with communication then when I originally joined Twitter. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/555757668682330112))<br>
Are we going back to BC era of communication? I really really hope not. Even on the forums you guys are quiet now. <br>
<br>
What happened?<br>
just a lot of scrutiny over me using my personal Twitter as a personal Twitter account (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/555770380502065153))<br>
There is some understandable frustration with the current lack of communication. Blizzard seems to have stopped the Dev twitter communication model but its not clear what the new model is.<br>
<br>
That&apos;s great, but there is nothing on the forums. The least people ask for is a reply, even if it&apos;s &quot;We&apos;re doing nothing yet&quot;<br>
Patch notes are a central location for people to find out about future changes. Don&apos;t want news spread throughout forum threads. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/555810786010873856))<br>
