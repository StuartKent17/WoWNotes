In-Game Group Finder Advertising Policy Changes<br>
Keep in mind that Patch 8.0 will also remove the ability of addons to create Group Finder groups (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7718-Battle-for-Azeroth-World-Quest-UI-Changes-Tweets-FinalBossTV-Paladins-DLC-637).<br>
As part of our ongoing efforts to crack down on in-game advertising, we&#x2019;ll be implementing some policy changes with how we handle moderation for advertisements made through the in-game Group Finder, and wanted to give you a heads up before these policies are put into place.<br>
<br>
Beginning Monday, July 2nd, we will no longer allow any advertisements in the Group Finder for in-game services such as carries or boosts, including those being offered in exchange for in-game gold. The Group Finder is intended for -- as the name suggests -- finding groups, and these advertisements make it difficult to find active groups that are currently being formed. Additionally, these are often used as a cover for real-money sales, particularly given that in-game gold cannot be transferred cross-realm.<br>
<br>
Note that this does not change our policy on selling things such as raid carries for in-game gold. Those are still allowed, but should be advertised through realm-specific methods such as trade chat.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll be adding an &#x201C;advertisement&#x201D; option to the Group Finder&#x2019;s right-click reporting function with Patch 8.0, but in the meantime, they can be reported using the &#x201C;spam&#x201D; option. Thank you for your understanding, and for helping us keep the Group Finder clear of unwanted advertisements.<br>
