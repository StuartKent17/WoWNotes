Yet another beta build is on the way.<br>
The Beta realms will be shutting down for maintenance in a few minutes in order to deploy a new build. I&apos;ll be updating this thread with information and time estimates as I receive them. I don&apos;t have an ETA yet, but these pushes usually take at least 8 hours, if not more.<br>

Lords of War Part Five - Maraad<br>
We proudly present the epic conclusion to Blizzard Entertainment&#x2019;s animated lore miniseries Lords of War! Watch the tale of draenei champion Vindicator Maraad, and then catch the entire series to learn about some of the other major players in the upcoming World of Warcraft expansion, Warlords of Draenor.<br>
