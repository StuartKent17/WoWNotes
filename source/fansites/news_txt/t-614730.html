WotLK to be released on November 13 2008<br>
That&apos;s it, the WotLK release date is now definitive and the game will be available in store on November 13 2008. The source is an advertisement on Wowhead, which also happens to be an official Blizzard fansite. It means : <br>
We&apos;re now 2 months away from Wrath of the Lich King<br>
Patch 3.0.2 will probably be deployed on live servers very soon, probably in mid october. <br>
