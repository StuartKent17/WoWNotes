PvP Flagging
Flagging on PvE has always been kind of weird. You can be flagged, I'm not flagged, and I can either spend time on a long-cast nuke, or even sheep you, and you have no way to counter me. Or a flagged person can do all sorts of devious things to try to trick people into getting someone else to flag by clicking on them or whatever. Separately there are a ton of abilities in the game, and some of them just cease to work at all if we tried to fix some of them causing flagging. Lastly ?, someone can be flagged and if you heal them that flags you! My personal favey fav as a healer.

We're aware. It's become a more relevant discussion because of the activity on the isle and your feedback, but it's a big discussion and a big change, and probably not something we're going to be able to address while the isle is still relevant for most of you.

Bashiok: If you dont hotfix current content so that all can enjoy it, why waste time making changes after it becomes a ghost town?
Sorry my reply was maybe confusing, we're aware PvE flagging in general is weird regardless of the isle or any other content, and a change to PvE flagging in-general is something we're discussing but is probably a ways away. The problem doesn't start and stop with the Timeless Isle, although that of course seems very relevant at the moment.

in other words once the island becomes an empty deserted wasteland with little or no players then well consider making it where PvP is optional well that would kind of be a moot point then dont you think?
Not at all, PvE flagging is sure to continue to be an issue for many years to come without a change. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/271327-pvp-toggle-off-switch-part-3/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10025862671?page=10#188

Timeless Isle Elites
All of the elites telegraph their attacks, meaning they have cast bars hit V to turn on nameplates on directed attacks or literal effects that show where their attack will land. Moving and keeping out of those things use them Void Tendrils! makes every elite on the ground-level at least definitely soloable as it's about knowing when to move out of an attack more than your health or damage. If you're doing it right you really shouldn't take any damage from them. As you go higher up the hill you'll maybe want to join a group.

Conquest Cap Bug
A fix was made to restore the Conquest cap back to the proper level of 2200. A very small number of players were able to purchase more gear than intended, and we will be addressing those on a case-by-case basis. 

We're currently working on implementing a hotfix to bring the Conquest vendors back as soon as possible. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/269287-conquest-vendors-temporarily-disabled/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9972358604?page=28#545

Timeless Isle
I hit level cap yesterday and I'm late to the party as it is, so to be able to catch up with my peers quickly put a real smile on my face.
First of all, I'm really glad that you're enjoying our latest patch.
Now you just need to get a new epic helmet so we can see that gremlin, ahem, I mean... goblin smile!

Plenty of people moaning about it ruining the game making older MoP raids obsolete but I don't see it that way at all. I still want to run all of them to see the story, the mechanics and just all the content.
I must say I respect both sides of the argument and I’m pretty sure devs do as well. Ultimately, catch-up mechanics accelerates the devaluing of gear, and that might have at least a psychological impact on the players’ attachment to their items and/or the effort involved in getting them and ultimately to the game itself. That’s the bad part.

The good part is, it also allows for a more relaxed and free play style, where you’re not just as good as the time you invest in the game. Time should matter of course, but it shouldn’t be the be-all and end-all in any game. Individual skill, gameplay, “fun”, and game sociability are just as important.

Content is being added and updated all the time, catch-up mechanics are here to help to bridge the gap between old content and new content, else we’d be back to Karazhan alt raiding times which was a lot of fun I must say! But you have to admit that it was much more repetitive than it is now when you raid with an alt.

What I particularly like about this system is that it helps the new guy a little bit, but it helps the guy with a ton of alts a lot more, as he can loot chests with all his alts and have a much better chance to completely gear up a freshly dinged 90 in 496 gear. This makes sense to me, since a player with a lot of alts has a much higher chance to have already experienced all the content that is being skipped.

Of course, whoever really wanted to skip content, never needed Timeless Isle. Catch-up mechanics have been introduced in 5.3 for Arena and RBGs, and everyone had a chance to grab a full set of 496 tyrannical gear before 5.4 even arrived.

Besides, 496 is below the ilvl from last patch’s LFR gear, so this doesn’t really have a strong devaluing power over recent gear 5.3 gear.

well isn't that the goal for pve content? for everyone to play whatevers and be super close to dps?
The definition of "super close" changes over time. It was 30-50% in LK. It has shrunk to 1-2% in MoP. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377203936660172800
I don't believe that shrinking definition is healthy for the game, but not sure how to prevent it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377204048199311360

If solo-healing challenges like on Norushen are easier to deal with by dpsing, why isn't healer dps somewhat normalized, yet?
Because it's one encounter and classes are too similar as it is. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376882390624645121

why don't Hunter Aspects add personal utility? bat drain life on shot, spider root on shot, turtle dmg reduction, etc?
It's an idea that sounds better on paper. Many grew annoyed at having to twist Aspects frequently for situational benefit. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376888908232916992

any chance arms could be closer than 50k off fury in t16, having one aoe spec and one single target spec isnt fun
We're okay with Arms being ahead of Fury on cleave / AE, but want to make sure the delta between them is not too large. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377203676873375744

remove the GCD lock from Warrior's plz ... its soo bad to be the only class locked to 1.5sec
The design keeps getting pushed that way because so many warrior players don't like any down time. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375789379752427520
I suspect 1 sec GCD warriors would lead to more "I'm standing around waiting for rage" comments again. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375789488380706816
It's one of those tensions between what might be a superior design vs the expectations of a dude who played warrior for 8 years. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375789791536615424

New Character Models
W/ new models, will Nelves get their ferocity back? Nelf females feel like ditzy airheads with some animations, not amazonians
Not entirely up to me, but I miss them being fierce and a little scary from Warcraft 3. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376885370442371072

True, but you also assume this isn't a priority to players along with better graphics and that just isn't true.
We made no such assumption. We did however assume that new boss and armor models in SoO were *also* a priority for players. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375303431746895872
Character models, buildings, trees, world, etc > then 3 month armor/weapons. Missing point that game is OLD looking for 2013.
MoP had many brand new buildings and trees. We agree the character models have fallen behind, which is why we're upgrading them. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375751004429369344

PvE
At the very, very high end, there are more Horde guilds. Alliance ones are still quite successful though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376887025573457921
It's when you let ridiculous imbalances like the 5% troll racial work on 1/3rd of all ToT bosses go live, so easy to avoid
That one doesn't bother us. We don't want to make situational racials irrelevant when one can finally be useful. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377199506162343938
The active abilities for troll and orc are more to blame in our opinion: just another CD to macro with all the others. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377199738333843456

Hardmode raiding and factional imbalance among raiding pops, not as a whole: What can be done, if anything?
Not sure anything can be done. We'd have to make Alliance racials quite OP to convince Horde to switch until we reached parity. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376883000589287424
And I fully get that you don't make the call on those types of decisions, so I sympathise- it's a real pickle.
Yeah, we haven't given up on the problem for sure. We just don't have a great solution in hand. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377206389963112448

"Convincing horde to switch" is a straw man, right solution is to balance racials and let time heal those wounds
I don't think the time it would take years? would be acceptable to the folks with the complaint. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377206107241869313
By which I meant the time for equilibrium to reassert itself, not the time to balance numbers. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377206211784884225

So you acknowledge theyre imbalanced, but do nothing?
Players focus too much on the balance, which likely doesn't even affect them. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376887118846373888
Bemoaning "players care about stuff they shouldn't", is that productive? Maybe attend to feedback, rather than dismissing it?
Part of being a game designer is appreciating all feedback but knowing on which you should act and on which you should file away. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377205659135008768

Have you found that raidbots is inconsistent with your internal testing? If so, to how great a degree?
I've talked about this a few times. It's a good source of data if you understand and respect its limitations. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376886396922757120
For example, comparing the means of populations with very different sample sizes can lead you to bad conclusions. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376886562501324800
Also, numbers change dramatically as players learn the fights and gear up. N numbers might go down when guilds go H. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376886790860185600


PvP
Why aren't there ever legendaries for pvp? I can't raid for hours at a time. I thought MoP was "play it your way"?
Wouldn't a PvP legendary just feel mandatory for every player before they could realistically compete in PvP? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378282294441541632

Why exactly is PW:S nerfed by Battle Fatigue and yet not buffed by Twist of Fate? Same question on Prayer of Mending.
We felt that Battle Fatigue needed to affect absorbs or PvP healing strategy would skew towards using them. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376131423129722880
Was more confused about ToF not affecting PW:S/PoM, not so much the reasoning behind Battle Fatigue affecting absorbs.
We use "heal" to mean literal heals vs. absorbs but also the general notion of keeping folks alive. For ToF, we mean the former. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377205186344677376
