Imprisoned players are stunned, suffer 80,000 Shadow damage and gain 5 Pride every second. Players remain stunned until all titan locks surrounding the prison have been activated. Titan locks are activated by having a player stand within the lock&apos;s rune and remaining there until the prison is deactivated. In 25 player Difficulty, the Sha of Pride activates 4 prisons.<br>
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/heroic.png&quot; title=&quot;Heroic&quot; /&gt; Banishment (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/145215) - The Sha of Pride banishes a random player to the corrupted Sha Realm. Banished players leave behind a physical form of their pride and remain banished until it is destroyed. Players within the Sha realm move 50% faster and are compelled to continually run forward, unable to stop. Additionally, coming into contact with corruption within the Sha realm inflicts 350,000 Shadow damage every second. Any player damage by the Sha realm gains 5 Pride.<br>
<br>
Orb of Light (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/145345) - Orbs of Light form within the corrupted Sha realm that weaken a player&apos;s physical form of pride. Each orb inflicts 25% of the physical form&apos;s maximum health in Holy damage and increases its damage taken by 25%. This effect stacks.<br>
<br>
Reaching Attack (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/144774) - The Sha of Pride strikes at a distant target, inflicting 50% of weapon damage as Shadow and increasing Shadow damage taken by 25% for 8 sec. The Sha uses this ability when no targets are in melee range.<br>
Unleashed (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/144832) - When the Sha of Pride reaches 30% health remaining it becomes unleashed. With its unleashed power, the Sha focuses on Norushen, instantly killing him. The remaining power of the unleashed Sha inflicts 245,000 Shadow damage every 10 seconds for the remainder of the encounter. Players gain 5 Pride each time they are damaged by Unleashed.<br>
<br>
Final Gift (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/144854) - As Norushen dies, he purifies all players, reducing their Pride to zero.<br>

&quot;Going to try DP scaling with Spirit. GoAK with AE heals. Maybe buff to WoG, EF, LoD.&quot;<br>
For some clarification on this, here&apos;s the patch notes for Divine Plea and Holy&apos;s Guardian of Ancient Kings in the next PTR build:<br>
<br>
Guardian of the Ancient Kings (Holy version) has been redesigned. The ability is no longer limited to the next 5 single-target heals, and deals additional healing based on all healing spells cast by the Paladin for its duration. The ability also increases the Paladin&apos;s haste by 10% while it&apos;s active. However, the duration of the ability has been reduced to 15 seconds (down from 30 seconds). Divine Plea no longer reduces the amount of healing done by 50%, and now restores 135% of the Paladin&apos;s Spirit as mana every 3 seconds for 9 seconds. The total amount of mana restored will always be at least 12% of the Paladin&apos;s total mana.<br>
<br>
As per usual, anything is subject to change. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/262957-54-holy-paladin-opinions-feedback-and-ideas/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9344634569?page=32#625))<br>

Combat is supposed to feel faster-paced than the other specs, but we agree that it&apos;s gotten a bit TOO spammy, particularly where the Tier 15 set bonus is concerned. We don&apos;t have any solid info on any changes we might make yet, but we definitely see the concern and are discussing it.<br>
<br>
The challenge we always face when balancing between different specs that perform the same role is that, even if the benefits are relatively small, some players will feel &quot;required&quot; to play whichever is &quot;best&quot;. Even in cases where each spec has a clearly defined niche that they excel at, some players still feel like they should change specs from fight to fight to match each encounter&apos;s mechanics.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re not sure it&apos;s even possible to ever balance things out completely perfectly so that all specs are equal in all areas, but we do our best to at least minimize the differences. It&apos;s far too early to guess at which specs will be &quot;best&quot; once 5.4 launches, but our goal is to allow you to play whichever you enjoy the most without feeling like you&apos;re making a huge sacrifice.

Free Character Moves (US)<br>
If you&apos;re on one of the source realms listed below, you can move your characters to one of the designated destination realms and avoid the queues -- for free!<br>
<br>
By initiating one of these transfers, you will be moving your character to a new realm and home. This is a one-time, one-way move. If you wish to move your character elsewhere, you will need to use the paid transfer service (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=20530).<br>
<br>
Source Realm -&gt; Destination<br>
Stormrage-&gt; Trollbane<br>
Area 52 -&gt; Turalyon<br>
Darkspear -&gt; Vashj<br>
Tichondrius -&gt; Blackrock<br>
Illidan -&gt; Mannoroth<br>
Bleeding Hollow -&gt; Korgath<br>
<br>
Please be aware that, due to the unpredictable nature of free transfers, we may close down any Free Character Moves at any time and without warning if the target realm becomes full. If you plan to move with friends or your guild, we suggest that you coordinate the effort to reduce the chance of any stragglers being left behind.<br>
<br>
Early closures aside, this set of Free Character Moves will end on Thursday, July 25.<br>
<br>
Begin a Free Character Move (https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move-eligible-realms.html) now! We recommend reviewing the FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=20530), as it details what is or isn&apos;t allowed for transferred characters.<br>
<br>
I thought the purpose of the Free Realm Transfer was to repopulate dying realms. Korgath is already a high population realm. Wouldn&apos;t it serve the purpose better to offer the Free Realm Transfer to one of the dying low population realms like Archimonde?<br>
We&apos;ve found over the years that people would rather stay on high population realms with long queues than move to very low population realms. When offering transfers - even free ones - to low population realms, very few people take the offer and high queue times persist. By providing transfers to medium population realms we can, at the very least, offer them a somewhat enticing reason to get away from their long queues and offer relief to that entire realm.<br>
<br>
Obviously we&apos;re exploring some new ways to solve low population issues in 5.4, and we&apos;ll have more details on how that will all work (as well as a final name!) in the near future.

SWTOR is adding an interesting way for players to provide feedback on classes and get developer replies. You can see the full post over on Darthhater (http://www.darthhater.com/articles/feature/25048-class-representative-program-launches).<br>
<br>
How Will Class Representatives Be Selected?<br>
This process is going to be largely in your hands! As of the time of making this post, you will be able to head over to your Advanced Class Forum and you will find a post where you can begin nominations for who your Class Representative will be. After a span of time (a week or so) we will create a poll with the names we saw mentioned most, by each AC, and you will vote on who you want your rep to be! I want to note that Class Representatives will be shared across mirrored ACs, so Sentinel and Marauder will have the same representative. We are still going to allow one to be selected for each, but they will rotate in their responsibilities.<br>
<br>
Also, each Class Representative will only serve for one &#x201C;term&#x201D; (more on that later). After that a new representative will be elected!<br>
<br>
What Will They Do?<br>
Upon the Class representatives being selected, we will release a schedule. On each scheduled date listed, the chosen representative for each Class will make a forum post in their Class forum with the top 3 things they want to have answered or commented on. Our current plan is to do 4 ACs each month with 2 ACs being able to propose questions every 2 weeks.<br>
<br>
Up until the scheduled date, the rep&#x2019;s job is to work to figure out what the top 3 issues or questions are for their Class. Once posted, we will begin working with the Combat Team to get an answer or comment to all 3 of those issues, regardless of what they are! Our goal is a one week turnaround from the time that you post the questions for us to get you an answer. I will stress now that our development schedule will take priority at all times, so if our Combat Team is unavailable due to development constraints, any of this schedule is subject to change.<br>
<br>
Expectations<br>
Our number one goal is to get your questions answered. We have known for some time that players have had Class balance questions, and it has been tricky to get them answered. The purpose of this initiative is to get those questions addressed as directly as possible. I want to make sure we stress the following things:<br>
<br>
It is possible, and even likely, that we could disagree with player sentiment towards something in relation to Class balance. Ex: Why does suck at ?! We may respond that we feel they are in a good place in our design goals and we will do our best to explain why.<br>
<br>
Attaching feedback to your top 3 in no way guarantees that it will be feedback that is actionable. The purpose is to allow a set dialog between our Combat Team and you here on the forums. Just because something appears in the top 3 provided by a representative does not mean it is feedback that will garner special treatment.<br>
<br>
Class Representatives are player elected and will not be granted any special access to the BioWare team. If chosen, you won&#x2019;t have to sign an NDA or anything similar. You will be a player-elected forum user who assists your Class in formulating the top issues and concerns you would like to have BioWare commentary on.</div></div>
