Mailing Heirlooms to Other Realms<br>
Ok so hierlooms(think thats how you spell it)can not be sent to other servers now the idea behinde these is to help people lv new chars faster right so why cant you send these to other realms,seriously blizz most ppl would like to be able to send them to other realms.This is a small issue that would make a massive difference to alot of people<br>
So, in case we can put this topic to rest...<br>
<br>
Regarding the ability to send heirlooms cross-realms, please be aware that it&apos;s highly unlikely it&apos;ll be implemented during Mists of Pandaria as there&apos;re numerous technical hurdles that need to be overcome first in order to happen. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/249129-hierlooms-why-not/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6200871344?page=1#7))<br>
<br>
Brawler&apos;s Guild Cooldowns<br>
We are happy with the way cooldowns currently work for abilities in the Brawler&#x2019;s Guild. Most of them should reset by the time the next fight begins (Yes, not all do but most fall into this category). Right now we don&#x2019;t want to expand what types of content are given the free temporary respec and cooldown resets. Adding these to an element of PvE might lead to a slippery slope.<br>
<br>
Um, most 5+ minute cooldowns as well as all battle rez&apos;s reset after a raid boss dies or wipes you, as well as killing a boss clearing sated. Its already in PvE. And frankly for a good reason, sitting around waiting for cooldowns isn&apos;t fun nor does it add anything<br>
With short queues, it&apos;s understandable that this can be frustrating. As it populates though, you shouldn&apos;t really notice it.

No Dec 25th Maintenance<br>

Classes<br>
Players quick to assume balance drives class %s. After looking at 8 years of data, we don&apos;t think it&apos;s a major factor. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276753264098295808))<br>
<br>
One of the reasons they have a hard time being objective is that switching costs to another class are very high.<br>
Agree that switching to a new class is tough. Swapping specs is less so and IMO players often overestimate the need to. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277532970259214337))<br>
<br>
You mentioned in the recent pod cast that There are more ret pallies than rogues. Does that mean Rogue buffs or Ret nerfs?<br>
We think kit, fun, visuals, doing something special and flexibility are probably bigger drivers. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276753491874156544))<br>
Then what does your data say about the Lock, Mage, War population right now?<br>

Hey GC, is the Blood DK Tier 14 4 Piece bonus not supposed to boost blood shield, or is that a bug? Thanks. <br>
It is intended to (in this case, not for every +heal). Should have been fixed in 5.1. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277227896152678400))<br>

You say you want talent options for PvP, yet every Hunter has Silencing Shot, Blink Strike, and Glaive Toss.<br>
Silencing is too good vs. the alternatives. The Glaive Toss problem is that Power Shot isn&apos;t reliable enough. Can fix both. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276505294341828609))<br>

How you feel about firemages losing there raid spots after recent hotfixes<br>
Haven&apos;t seen it happen. Some mages are able to try Arcane and Frost now though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276380349293027328))<br>
<br>
You said &quot;come back in a week and we will see how mages are&quot;, and yes, firemages are bottom :P<br>
Not seeing Fire on bottom. Happy where Fire is so far. Many mages trying Arcane and Frost, skewing results of sites like raidbots. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277197109097275393))<br>
10 man normal: 45,366 parses for Fire, 12,702 for Arcane, 9,776 for Frost. 22,478 are the only good mages?<br>
That&apos;s size not bias. Bias is Frost jumping 10K or whatever with no buffs. That means the # for Frost before was not accurate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277539288323850240))<br>
<br>
Tweetered you a few days ago, (not nagging but...) please take another look at combustion, it&apos;s hardly worth casting anymore.<br>
Off the GCD + free damage... hmmm. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277125066435743744))<br>
<br>
change to onuse trinket CD will allow mages with 2 on use trinkets to have 1 available for every single deep freeze. intended?<br>
Smaller burst every 30s is easier to survive than a larger burst every 60s. Humans have to give up the not-nerfed proc trinket. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276867325993570304))<br>
honestly think mages would be fine if you got rid of the glyph that let them explode their own frost bombs<br>
Yeah, also on the list. Risk might be that Frost Bomb never does damage. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276868207124553728))<br>
BTW, why does Frost Bomb have special dispel rules, when other class DoTs such as Devouring Plague do not? Hypocrisy.<br>
Having variety in spells isn&apos;t the typical definition of hypocrisy. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277123460357058560))<br>
<br>
After almost a full weeks raiding do you feel fire mage damage is where it should be or have they been hit a bit too hard?<br>
We&apos;re happy with it at the high end. Looking to make sure less geared Fire mages didn&apos;t drop too much. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277531839307075586))<br>
<br>
This week (since the hotfix) fire has twice as many parses than Frost and Arcane combined, how would that skew the results?<br>
Look at Arcane&apos;s curve leap skyward. Now considered they were not buffed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277204035352805377))<br>
Your reply implies that min/max moved to Arcane. Those outliers alone don&apos;t explain why median numbers for Fire fell so much.<br>
We def nerfed Fire. That was the intent. Just trying to explain that 22nd out of 24 is hyperbole or not reading data well. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277225916382449664))<br>
Does this look like hyperbole to you? http://t.co/35U5jM2Hhttp://t.co/x8H5mwTtNotice the sudden dropoff dec 4<br>
Change that chart to just Fire and Frost. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277237744282001409))<br>
Why not be transparent and make a reporting site w/ your data? Arguments can actually be solved with fact<br>
Data isn&apos;t the problem. Raidbots, World of Logs etc have tons. Analysis is the challenge. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277535428477870080))<br>
Do you know what &quot;median&quot; means?<br>
Yes. I also know what sampling bias means. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277239214452649985))<br>
thus ANY change on RaidBots is exaggerated due to sampling bias and not always reflective of expected performance<br>
Yes. It doesn&apos;t mean the data are useless. It just means you need to be careful. Raidbots site even states that down below. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277535007994699776))<br>

Arcane received a buff (Mana cost reduction and boost to damage per stack) Made haste&gt;mastery until high iLevel<br>

why did you guys remove cataclysm warlock spell since its a good utility, not OP and on top its a dps loss...just curious<br>
It wasn&apos;t actually good utility. Melee just stepped away from it until the effect ended. Maybe useful in PvE, but wasn&apos;t the goal. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276754295783833601))<br>
<br>
with the &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot; standing why are warlocks still the only class with health stones? Thanks.<br>
We don&apos;t think there is much risk of locks being mandatory just for stones. Some differences are good for the game. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277122540135137281))<br>

you keep saying that the old way to gain rep is gone most likely forever. Are we going to see meaningful rep gains anywhere?<br>

<br>
Hey Greg, what about brining back tabards, and have all the rep you gain from any/all dailies go towards said faction.<br>
What&apos;s the goal there? Just speeding rep up or letting you skip quests you don&apos;t like? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277533104036540416))<br>
