Boubouille2014-04-04, 10:39 PMWarlords of Draenor Alpha Coming Up
The alpha files just went up, it will take us a couple of hours to probably go through everything but you should probably stay tuned and check back every now and then. Tonight, we dine in Draenor!

In an effort to keep people moderately excited, please have a stream of the WoW vanilla login screen with a WoD logo, because that's probably the only thing you'll see from the alpha for the next hour or so.
