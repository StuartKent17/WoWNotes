(It was only mentioned once until now)<br>
<br>
It&apos;s still unsure on how it will affect 2.4 testing but it wouldn&apos;t be surprising if it wasn&apos;t deployed on PTR this week after all, actually the post announcing the PTRs back online on January 10th has been edited and changed to &quot;will not come back up until next phase&quot; and it probably doesn&apos;t mean anything good for us. <br>
In order to perform maintenance, all PTRs will be taken down on January 7th at 18:00 Paris time (CET). This will conclude the 2.3.2 PTR phase and the realms will not come back up until the next testing phase. <br>
<br>
The Blizzard podcast is still scheduled for release tomorrow if everything goes well. (Nothing confirmed officialy and publicly yet)<br>
<br>
<br>
2.3.2 Mirrors<br>
If you&apos;re a bit late and didn&apos;t download the patch yet, it&apos;s still available on our download servers. <br>

AV hotfix - Balinda and Vanndar health increased<br>
Another tweak to try to balance the situation in Alterac Valley. This is a hotfix and you should notice the change immediatly. <br>
We&#x2019;ve recently applied a hotfix that increases the hitpoints for both Balinda Stonehearth and Vanndar Stormpike in Alterac Valley. This change is being made to help assist in balancing the opposing sides and their ability to compete in the battleground.<br>
<br>
We will continue to track the balance of the battleground and the factions as they fight for supremacy in Alterac Valley, and continue to make further changes as needed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Alchemy - Transmutation mastery fixed<br>
That&apos;s a pretty good news for all the alchemists out there, time to make tons of money again. <br>
Transmute mastery has been fully fixed in 2.3.2 This was a change that didn&apos;t make it into the patch notes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Armory performance issues<br>
They fixed parts of the armory but it seems it&apos;s still not enough, Blizzard is still working on it to get it fixed as soon as possible.<br>
We are aware that some players may be experiencing some performance issues with the Armory; due to the popularity of the Armory, it is susceptible to high amounts of traffic which can result in slow load times. These slow load times can adversely affect armory performance, cause character data to not refresh properly, result in browser issues, or cause the page to stop responding entirely. We are actively working on addressing these issues and will provide updates as soon as they are available.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mages - Icy Veins tooltip<br>
Mages, be careful if you plan to respec after the patch, the tooltip is a bit misleading and you might want to read this post first.<br>
The tooltip for Icy Veins is a bit misleading, it provides 20% haste not 20% cast reduction. 20% haste as Duman explains provides less than 20% cast reduction. The ability is working correctly and the tooltip is going to be updated in a future patch.<br>

Hammerfall Wind Rider Master<br>
Urda the Hammerfall Wind Rider Master is bugged and currently hiding out from the rain beneath the platform that she normally stands upon. She should be returning to her normal position in an upcoming patch. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3773504895&amp;postId=37729070238&amp;sid=1#1))<br>
<br>
Hunters - Volley<br>
The new graphic (introduced in 2.2) was causing performance problems and had to be temporarily reverted. The new graphics for Volley will return in a future patch.<br>
<br>
Abilities triggering from crits<br>
Abilities should not trigger from crits on sitting players, this is in the 2.3.2 patch notes but doesn&apos;t seem to be very clearly explained. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3773324689&amp;postId=37729070371&amp;sid=1#1))<br>

There are tons of known issues with 2.3.2, I&apos;m posting them to make sure that everyone notice them and realize the amount of bugs introduced with the patch, even if most of them are minor we can probably expect a 2.3.3 patch to fix everything before the 2.4.<br>
