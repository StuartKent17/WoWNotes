Siege of Orgrimmar Changes in Patch 6.0 and Warlords of Draenor
In the recent Dev Watercooler: Raiding Azeroth Part 3—Warlords of Draenor, we discussed some of the raid changes coming in the next WoW expansion. Before Warlords of Draenor launches, players will have a chance to experience the new raid structure firsthand in the Siege of Orgrimmar.

In the upcoming Patch 6.0, the pre-expansion “systems” update planned to go live in the weeks leading up to Warlords of Draenor’s release, we’ll be converting Siege of Orgrimmar to use the new Normal, Heroic, and Mythic difficulties. Both Normal and Heroic difficulties will support flexible raid sizes and our cross-server Group Finder tool, while Mythic will be a fixed 20-player size. At the same time, “stat squish” will be in effect, the new class changes will be live, and Hit and Expertise will no longer be stats on items, so those will be replaced with more useful ones on all existing items. The raid as a whole will be retuned for the new numbers and scaling size—overall, it should prove no more difficult than it is currently, and will likely be easier in many places.

With the end of an expansion and a raid tier, along with introduction of a new level cap, we’ll also be retiring a handful of rewards. We want to encourage everyone to enjoy one last hurrah in the Siege of Orgrimmar before your adventure on Draenor begins.

In addition to the above changes, when Patch 6.0 arrives:


Flexible Raid difficulty will cease to exist as it does now, and will be removed from the raid queue interface. The new Normal difficulty of Siege of Orgrimmar will offer a similar experience to that of Flexible Raid.
The new Group Finder tool will be available, designed to help players create and find groups for Normal and Heroic Siege of Orgrimmar and other cross-realm group content.
Siege of Orgrimmar achievements will be relabeled according to the new difficulty structure e.g. “Heroic: Malkorok” will now be “Mythic: Malkorok”. Credit for these will be retroactively awarded to players who earned them before Patch 6.0.
The Garrosh Hellscream “Ahead of the Curve http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8399-ahead-of-the-curve-garrosh-hellscream-25-player” and “Cutting Edge http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8401-cutting-edge-garrosh-hellscream-25-player” Feats of Strength will cease to be obtainable.
This means that the Kor’kron War Wolf http://www.wowdb.com/spells/148396-korkron-war-wolf, awarded by the “Ahead of the Curve http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8399-ahead-of-the-curve-garrosh-hellscream-25-player” Feat of Strength, will also cease to be obtainable upon release of the pre-expansion Patch 6.0.
With the release of Patch 6.0, the drop rate of the Heirloom weapons http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-reqlvl-min=90&filter-quality=128 from Garrosh Hellscream on Normal, Heroic, and Mythic difficulties will be significantly increased.
Players who have yet to get any Heirlooms will have a 100% guaranteed chance of getting a spec-appropriate Heirloom when defeating Garrosh on Normal difficulty or higher.
The chance of receiving additional Heirlooms beyond the first will also be increased.


When Warlords of Draenor is released and players are able to head to Draenor and level past 90:


Garrosh Hellscream will no longer drop Heirloom weapons.
The Kor’kron Juggernaut http://www.wowdb.com/spells/148417-korkron-juggernaut mount will cease being a guaranteed drop from Mythic Garrosh Hellscream, and will instead become a rare drop like Invincible’s Reins, Mimiron’s Head, etc..


All other loot, achievements, and cosmetic rewards e.g. the Kor’kron Dark Shaman transmog set, rare battle pets, etc. will remain unchanged.

But reduce disarms duration to 4 seconds, while disarmed you can still control your character. Storm bolt is an unavoidable stun.
We don't plan on bringing disarms back but if we had left them, we would have removed weapon chains and set duration to 4 seconds. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/455891068098056193

Fine line b/t "too much" and "not enough"; similar to healer/spirit changes. If other stats are compelling: no issue.
While interesting in concept, it would feel extremely negative in practice. "Why do rogues only get 5% regen from 10% haste?" Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/455966058231648256

Do you think hunters overall got hit by the nerfbat the most in terms of CC reduction/removal?

Will multistrike proc ignite for firemages? Thoughts on combustion w/o skull banner, alter time or haste snapshotting?
Multistrikes of your other spells can add to your Ignite DoT, yes. Ignite itself cannot Multistrike. You can benefit once. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/456387001952915456
Snapshotting has trivial impact on Combustion, but the others are significant. Planning to buff Combustion. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/456387246849941505

buffing ret damage isn't gonna make the spec more fun. there's still gaps where I do nothing but wait for RNG procs etc.
Having a few empty GCDs here and there NOTE: I did *not* say often is good gameplay. Allows room for expansion/procs/etc. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/455966924514398208

Is the shadow priest mana issue addressed in the upcoming expansion? the mana problem is even worse in pvp.
We don't see it as a problem. It's intentional that mana is a limiting factor on your utility usage but not on DPSing. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/456371947681488896

what was the thought process or rather for which situation/purpose was gladiator stance designed ? feels like a pvp only talent
It's for when you want to be a sword and board DPS, only have prot gear, or prefer the prot rotation but want to DPS. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/456372354868736001

War Stomp? Does it stay or go?
Stay. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/455962859659223040

we want something from Blizzard on changes to EMFH. You realize it's an unfair advantage to Alliance, so why remain quiet?
We need to evaluate Warlords trinkets and then see PvP testing. That's part of the point of testing. Then we'll see. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/456434853978726400

Character / Items
What will happen to Ravenlord? Will we still be able to farm for him? Been trying for months.
Sure. Outland as a level 60-70 space isn't going anywhere. Though hopefully you'll get your mount soon! WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/456202859302768640

Will the burdens ever become BoA? I really do not need them on my main?
No plans to change that at this point. You can pass 496 gear to your alts, but you need to play those alts to get the 535s. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/456436251046842369
wouldn't it make sense for the tokens to be rare and then become epic from a burden? Sick of guild news feed being blown up
The guild news feed issue is definitely a pain. In 6.0 items like Timeless tokens or Kael'thas legendaries will be filtered out. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/456487512697864193

Warlords of Draenor Stats
Hey just curious, will all shields have bonus armor or will there be dps bonuses on them for gladiator stance warriors?
I'm not sure about bonus armor on shields, guessing not Regardless Bonus Armor will have DPS value. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/455962800238497792

Are you the right person for this? Hope so. Will certain old content fightslike Spine of Deathwing be retuned for solo?
Yes. We will absolutely 100% ensure you can still solo old raids, just as you already can. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/455966593269239808

PvE
I'm assuming the solution they have arrived at is make LFR far less compelling than Flex then ultimately remove it.
Raid Finder is an important system and the only way many people can experience our raid content. It's here to stay. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/456250469304639488

PvP
Is there anything you can do to fix world pvp : pve gear > pvp gear? or should ppl just unsub until xpac?
PvP gear is ilevel 550 and you have about 50% damage/healing from PvP power. PvP gear is very good now. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/455890776812032001

What is wrong with 2v2 this season? it seems like very good players who are normally 1900+ are fighting at 1600 all the time
One of the downsides of the inflation system is that when it resets, it's an abrupt drop in rating. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/455894941902729216

With Warlords of Draenor having a 90-99 battleground bracket, are you looking to expand other brackets to their 10 level ranges?
Yes holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/455933765135515648

Would you guys ever add a team matching system for PVP? You currently only do opponent match. http://t.co/6kn0KTwJU7
We've discussed solo ranked matchmaking. We're going to be doing it in Skirmish first. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/456235767447035904

Professions
First Aid. Any plans to reinvent/remove? Lost its touch since Vanilla/BC.
We're discussing ways of making it feel more relevant and no, not bandaging yourself on cooldown in raids. Nothing to share yet WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/456436575589519360

Garrisons
An interview mentioned that we would get things like Cavalry, Bombardment and Ridable siege tanks as perks Is this true?
One major goal is for garrisons to give you incredibly cool perks even outside of your garrison. Lots of things we're trying out Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/456240690725269505

so, with garrison's perk, will per example the free ress every day carry over into raids etc?
Probably not, would make those buildings feel mandatory for raiders. Choice/customization are big draws, don't want to railroad Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/456241804866641920
it may be a fantastic feature but the description of how it is being integrated worries me.
Getting everything the garrison offers isn't hard-gated by the quest line, you can do dungeons for all 10 levels if you want! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/456276784397303808

Nervous about Garrisons, don't like having to drop what I'm doing, run across Draenor, and "defend" my garrison.
It's not time-limited, working on the mechanism, doesn't require you to drop what you're doing. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/456344441368743936

Will we be able to name our NPC followers in the Garrisons in WoD?
They have names! Followers are not pets! Not even the Worgen ones! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/456499552359432192

awesome and what about the walls will they need a prerequisite like X amount of buildings added to ur garrisons ect
The walls come with the garrison, wouldn't be a very good base without walls! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/456565639490965506
