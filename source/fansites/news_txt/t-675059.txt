Due to issues with the instance servers crashing, we're going to reschedule the Icecrown Gunship Battle encounter for a future time.

[Spoiler] Icecrown Citadel - Frostmourne Area
I guess it didn't take long before smart people figured out there was an opening here and it only took a few hours to some people to figure out where the Frostmourne room was. Anyway, below is a small video and screenshot preview of the room added in the latest PTR patch and called "Frostmourne"

+DUNGEON_FLOOR_ICECROWNCITADEL7 = "The Frozen Throne";
+DUNGEON_FLOOR_ICECROWNCITADEL8 = "Frostmourne";

Blizzard warned you about spoilers, I warned you about spoilers, I guess I can't do much more than that. You can also stop sending me hatemails because "OH GOD YOU WILL NEVER POST ANYTHING AGAIN". 

Note : This is NOT the Frozen Throne, this is a completely different subzone of the instance.
