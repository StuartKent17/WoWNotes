Matchmaking Normal Difficulty Groups
Very unlikely, the extra convenience of having an automated queuing system for normal mode would be immediately defeated by the lack of coordination that these groups are usually accustomed to.

LFR's difficulty level is tuned exactly to match the level of coordination that one can expect on average from a group formed by an automated system.

Let people queue for Normal if they want to - but don't change mechanics to accommodate random queueing. Leave Nm as it is, difficulty-wise.
Given that extra option, I believe very few would be satisfied with queueing for LFR only.

What you said actually sounds reasonable at first, but once such an option becomes available, it creates false expectations. If such content isn't properly tuned for random grouping, it will only lead to nerf requests. We see that happening all the time even in LFR as I'm sure you're all aware, especially when new raids launch and they're slightly over-tuned.

There's also this issue with automated systems and their detrimental effects on the social potential of a game, which is an essential factor for any mmorpg, so we want to be very careful whenever we expand or change such systems.

Twitch Battle.Net Integration
Twitch has added the ability to link your Battle.Net account to your Twitch account and Blizzard is giving away a Heroes of the Storm portrait to those who link it and watch some of a Heroes of the Storm regional championship. Some kind of reward could be added for WoW in the future!
Twitch and Blizzard are teaming up to reward those who not only love to play Heroes of the Storm, but watch it, too!

Secure your portrait
For a limited time, anyone who watches a Heroes of the Storm regional championship while logged into Twitch with a linked Battle.net account will receive a special “Storm Watcher” portrait in Heroes of the Storm.

Your first opportunity to secure this portrait is quickly approaching. Tune in to the Americas Championship on September 19 and 20, and you’ll be among the first to receive the new portrait. After watching the Americas or other regional championship events, the portrait will be awarded to qualifying players starting in October, when it will appear in your in-game portrait collection.

Navigate to the Settings menu by clicking your account name in the top-right corner of the home screen.

Do I need to keep my accounts linked to receive the portrait?
In order to make sure we're able to properly grant the portrait award, please make sure you leave the accounts linked until the portrait has been awarded to your Battle.net account. We hope to offer additional promotions using this technology in the future, so we recommend leaving the account link in place if you’re interested in participating.

If I watch another region's championship and have my account linked, will I receive the reward in my home region?
Yes, watching the Americas, Korea, Europe, or Taiwan championships on Twitch will grant you the in-game portrait in all regions.

If I watch the event on a mobile device will I receive the portrait?
Yes, as long as you are logged in to Twitch and your accounts are linked while you watch the event, you will be eligible for the portrait reward.

Will other Blizzard games offer similar promotions?
The Heroes of the Storm “Storm Watcher” portrait is the only active promotion currently available. We’re considering rolling out similar promotions for our other games, but we don’t have any additional details to share at this time.
