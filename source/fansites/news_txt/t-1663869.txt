WoWProgress Rules Change
It appears that WoWProgress has added a new rule http://www.wowprogress.com/post/163_Abusing_realm_transfers_-_2 for rankings going forward that will not include guilds that realm transfer to buy gear from the BMAH.

Upcoming Garrison Outpost Hotfixes
We’ve been working on a solution to the issues with swapping buildings that some players have reported. Tomorrow’s restarts will fix several issues, but there are two outstanding issues that will have to be corrected in a future hotfix. In the meantime, we want to make sure players are aware of the issues so that you can avoid them.

Alliance players who changed outpost buildings in Spires of Arak prior to tomorrow's restarts will not be able to access the new building’s questline. Horde players who change outpost buildings in Talador will be unable to change their building a second time. The gold cost will be charged, but the building will instantly revert back.
Aside from those two issues, we believe the fix applied with tomorrow’s restarts will resolve all other issues with changing outpost buildings. The outstanding issues will be fixed as soon as possible.

Are you aware that the 25% chaos bolt pvp nerf introduced in 5.3 was never reverted even though resilience no longer exists?
Untrue. It was reverted. We've tested it multiple times. But crit damage is reduced by 25% in PvP in WoD. Just buffed CB. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/544320974519558145

Achievements
I was of the understanding that Blizz only wanted achievements that were achievable, hence introduction of Feats of Strength. now except the Ordos one. Very very frustrating, and I hope you understand 
Ordoes ones should be FOS now, you're correct, will fix. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/544368731724341249

PvP
I've never spoken to anyone who has received conquest from a gold box in BGs. This was supposed to be a feature of WOD.What's up?
We had to remove it from boxes last minute. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/544352838139543552

Lore
Hello, can you help get something settled? Is this http://wow.gamepedia.com/The_Schools_of_Arcane_Magic_-_Enchantment non-canon? And if it is canon, why is it canon? What I'm trying to ask is, Enchanting is called a School of the Arcane in this book, does this mean Enchanting is not a School of Fel? Items can be enchanted w/ Fel energy, so can Enchanters be those who use Fel energy to enchant stuff?
Enchanting probably uses several magical disciplines. Didn't we have shadow enchants at one point? DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/544645996777447425

Where are the Shamans on Draenor? I play Alliance, so I'm sure it's a factor, but exposure to Shamanism is very limited thus far.
The Draenei in this period hadn't learned shamanism yet. It was the broken draenei who turned to shamanism after their fall. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/544959502169026561

Garrisons
What's your stance on follower trait re-rolls as opposed to the re-roll item for both traits and abilities?
Cool suggestion, we've heard a lot about re-rolling, thanks for the notes all! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/544728585005576192

Misc
Do the Iron Warchiefs have mandatory job-training workshops on standing in imposing postures while in a group?
just offscreen, Garrosh was coaching them all. "Line up - a little to the left Ner'zhul - yes! Hold it!" DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/544645634905501696
