So you say dps shamans are underperforming yet you nerf enhances set bonus? Logic much?
If it was a badly tuned for Ret, it was badly tuned for Enhance. We can find another way to help. holinka 

PvP
Will we be able to purchase conquest gear with honor after earning 27,000 conquest for the season?
no. That was primarily for offsets and the gear just changes now. Unnecessary going forward. holinka 

Suggest making PvP trinket set bonus a buff on player so it's possible to choose targets accordingly.Take advantage of no setbonus
you just want transparency of the bonus? holinka 

Garrisons

So frustrated at Apexis dailies. Spend 90% of my time running around trying to tag a mob. So is everyone else. Can we at least share the elites? Would make it feel more like joining a battle than competing to push a button first.
Try joining a group! Use the new Group-Finder button to join a group in progress doing that content. Give it a try! DaveKosak
