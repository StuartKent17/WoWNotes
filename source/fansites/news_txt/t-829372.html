The notes for tonight&apos;s PTR build have been updated, as usual, they are the only thing you should trust and any change mentioned here is more reliable than the funny datamining. Blizzard spends a lot more time than they used to working on very nice official patch notes, use them. (PS: I totally slacked and chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) did the notes update, love him, not me)<br>
<br>
It&apos;s also very interesting to point out that the racial flight forms are finally being activated in-game. <br>
