Warcraft III Invitational - February 27 and 28
Over 15 years since the release of Reign of Chaos, Warcraft III has a new major patch coming and your favorite players are throwing the first Warcraft III Invitational to celebrate it! 

Hosted by casters Neo and Remo of Back2Warcraft http://www.back2warcraft.com/, join us on February 27 and February 28 on Twitch https://www.twitch.tv/back2warcraft for a slew of special events, including Free-for-All, 4v4’s, and other friendly competitions. Well-known Warcraft III competitors from around the world will be getting together live at Blizzard HQ to showcase their talents in friendly competition!

We love and continue to support our Warcraft III community, and we’re excited to see classic competitors like Manuel “Grubby” Schenkhuizen, Park “Lyn” Joon, and Kim “ReMinD” Sung Sik try out all the new PTR changes for themselves—including balance adjustments to many heroes, widescreen support, and more – all playable now on the PTR! 

Be sure to tune in for your own sneak peek and check out our PTR patch notes for more information.
