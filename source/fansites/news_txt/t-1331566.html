Diablo 3&apos;s next expansion is named &quot;Reaper of Souls&quot;?<br>
Well we can definitely say the past few hours have been interesting. After uncovering the trademarking of The Dark Below (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3339-Blizzard-Trademarks-The-Dark-Below-WoW-or-D3-Expansion) yesterday, it looks like the teaser for the next Diablo 3 expansion just went live. <br>

<br>
According to the official website (http://us.battle.net/d3/en/reaper-of-souls/) &quot;Reaper of Souls&quot; is a trademark and linked to Diablo 3, with Gamescom coming up next week it wouldn&apos;t be surprising to see the expansion for Diablo 3 announced there.<br>
<br>
More importantly, it rules out The Dark Below as the next Diablo 3 expansion and makes things a lot more interesting suddenly.</div></div>
