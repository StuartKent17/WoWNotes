<br>
You can access them at this page:<br>
http://test.worldofwarcraft.com/ptr/character-copy.html (http://test.worldofwarcraft.com/ptr/character-copy.html)<br>
<br>
Have fun and be sure to report any bugs that you encounter in the new build.<br>
<br>
As the pre-made characters are level 70 and start in the Outlands, The Burning Crusade expansion is required to utilize them.<br>
<br>
All characters come with a full tier 6 equipment and ... [item=23162,en,us] bags. <br>
Nothing for the EU Players yet, but we can assume that it will be activated today or tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Yes, premades may be back soon, just be a bit more patient, I know it&apos;s not easy, but we are investigating the issue.<br>
