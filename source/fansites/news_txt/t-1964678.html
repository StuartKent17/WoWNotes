Mistweaver Monk Feedback -- Build 21249 -- 9-Mar<br>
Essence Font should be getting a maximum of 18 bolts per cast, even if you recast early. When testing it out on a single target, you may be able to see 7 heals instead of 6 when you chain two of them, but I believe in real multi-target use you&apos;d still see 36 bolts in total (let us know if you observe differently on alpha). <br>
<br>
There is still no reason to channel it all the way because the waves of bolts aren&apos;t evenly spaced over the duration of the channel.<br>
Essence Font should attempt to fire 18 bolts evenly spaced over the course of 1 (non-extended) channel regardless of haste. It&apos;s probably hard to test on fewer than 6 targets since you won&apos;t see some of the bolts. Please post a bug if you see any different behavior from that on alpha.

Hello! can you tell me if druids&apos; glyphs of Travel and Chamaleon will be avaliable in Legion in some way?<br>
Chameleon will be returning. Glyph of Travel is not currently planned to return, since glyphs are now cosmetic. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705225190112784384))<br>
<br>
So Judgement can get to 100% uptime with haste, but enrage has to be demolished by haste? I&apos;m a little confused. <br>
The haste breakpoints caused by fitting additional GCDs within that sort of short very powerful buff are (1/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705225388398497797))<br>
a significant issue. Judgment and Colossus Smash will be adjusted to solve this as well. (2/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705225433277603840))<br>

Hey, is bad luck protection built into Deepening Shadows at all? Wondering if there&apos;s a limit to the proc &quot;wait.&quot;<br>
It&apos;s a simple 5% chance per combo point, nothing further. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/705523549457375233))<br>

PvE<br>
The raiding scene is collapsing. Warcraft is dying. But don&apos;t worry, because we&apos;re honing in on pet battles!<br>
I understand the frustration, if you could focus on a few specifics, what do you want to see improved? What&apos;s broken? Why, IYO? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704930586918526976))<br>
make raiding a reward again for time and effort invested. You were at your peak when this was the case.<br>
This is a VERY good question. Can difficult raids exist in the modern world? Did it work for _____? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704961556803510276))<br>
For example, the expansion-ending raids last too long, that&apos;s totally true. But I feel that raid fights are solid in WOD (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704931179884105728))<br>
In before this shows up on MMO-C, ground floor. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704931337011142656))<br>
what about not longer but harder lvl, or Video how to fix the early game.<br>
Totally agree that more leveling challenges make for a more textured experience. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704938143187918848))<br>
I think the lvling in wow is actually wows biggest Problem (besides 1 year for 1 raid)<br>
Do people level often with their main now that boosts are a thing? I level alts, often in odd ways, eg archi (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704939240786944002))<br>
well I think alts should be more important for different playstyles and boosts dont feel statisfying (for me)<br>
Personally, I&apos;m an alt-gamer. I like levelling alts in fun ways, did Rogue All PvP, Tank All Dungeon (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704940316378439680))<br>
Note to self: why isn&apos;t there an achievement for this. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704940421248643074))<br>
Talking about alts: why is there no achievement for getting ALL classes to max level?<br>
If you could get a toy for this achievement, what would it do? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704960623407288320))<br>
<br>
Was Timeless Isle too challenging? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704963191739011072))<br>
<br>
Pets and Pet Battles<br>
That said, I&apos;d love to get some faction pride pets.Just not another scorpion for Horde. Tired of scorpions now.<br>
So like a boar? Or a wolf. Wolf-boar? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704953505459662848))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
so you said dungeons, world bossEs and pvp make an mmo. But it&apos;s more than that right?<br>
Not to be too undertale about it but people make an MMO. Free hugs. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704946491509579777))<br>
<br>
The players grew up, and so has the game. is still the 5000 lbs gorilla in the MMO room.<br>
every expac the game feels less like an mmo. What can you do to change this?<br>
What makes an MMO? Good question. What sparks MMO memories for you? Dungeons, World Bosses, PvP? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704942980105433089))<br>
random matchmade groups. The one thing I miss from Vanilla and BC wow was my server community<br>
.I don&apos;t disagree, I miss the old Tichondrius forums. Is this viable in the current climate? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704944266955657217))<br>
what do you mean the old forums? Like the old layout?<br>
.Nah like back in the day when people would post cascade memes during BWL progression @ckaleiki (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704945441880809475))<br>
did you play any older mmo, like Everquest or Ultima online?<br>
My first MMO was Dragonrealms, the text-based MUD (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704946645654495233))<br>
I spend 4+ hours leading community raids on normal because that&apos;s the only mmo feeling<br>
I remember this feeling from WOTLK Naxx, and then ICC/TOTC farming for solace (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704947137839276037))<br>
