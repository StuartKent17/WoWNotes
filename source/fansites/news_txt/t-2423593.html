IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 23, 2018-- When the Battle for Azeroth&#x2122;erupted worldwide last week, champions of the Alliance and the Horde around the globe were called upon to fight for their faction. Heroes everywhere turned out in force, and Blizzard Entertainment today announced that as of Battle for Azeroth&#x2019;s first full day of launch on August 14, more than 3.4 million units of the latest World of Warcraft&#xAE; expansion had sold through worldwide&#x2014;setting a new day-one sales record for the franchise and making it one of the fastest-selling PC games of all-time.*<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Battle for Azeroth is a definitive chapter in the Horde and Alliance conflict at the heart of Warcraft, and it&#x2019;s been thrilling to see players representing their factions in record numbers and embarking on their war campaigns&#x2014;not to mention joining in ourselves,&#x201D; said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. &#x201C;But the launch is just the beginning of this conflict. More epic content is coming to World of Warcraft in the weeks ahead, and we can&#x2019;t wait for players to experience the full story as it unfolds over the course of the expansion.&#x201D;<br>

As Azeroth&#x2019;s defenders continue to explore new regions in search of allies and resources, preparations are being made for the next great confrontation in the ongoing war:<br>
<br>
<br>
In the coming weeks, players will be able to charge into Battle for Azeroth&#x2019;s first Warfront, Stromgarde&#x2014;a 20-player co-op battle for control of a key strategic stronghold in the Arathi Highlands.<br>
On September 4, the gates will open to Battle for Azeroth&#x2019;s first raid&#x2014;Uldir, an ancient titan facility housing horrific Old God experiments gone awry.<br>
Also on September 4, the expansion&#x2019;s first PvP season and first Mythic Keystone dungeon season will commence. The Mythic Keystone dungeon will feature a unique &#x201C;seasonal affix&#x201D;&#x2014;Infested&#x2014;that introduces new challenges based on the corrupted denizens dwelling in the Uldir raid.<br>
Beyond that, additional updates are in the works that will provide even more content for players on an ongoing basis, including the ability to recruit the Kul Tiran humans and Zandalari trolls as playable Allied Races. More information on future updates will be shared at a later date.</div></div>
