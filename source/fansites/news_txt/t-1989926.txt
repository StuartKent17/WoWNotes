Mobs Level Scaling
This is actually intended; we've done some work behind the scenes to make it so mobs don't instantly level and get harder when you ding. The idea being that when you ding from 104 to 105, you haven't had a chance to get 105 gear yet, so you're wearing 104 gear and now creatures have more health and do more damage.

That's very wise. Addresses that concern quite well. how much does it lag behind though? If you gain 2 levels in a short period of time will mobs linger 2 levels behind or will the difference never exceed 1?
I believe it's somewhere around 50% - and then it'll trigger when you complete a quest, hit a loading screen, or log out. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Artifact Relics in PvP
We are considering disabling relics in PvP instances battlegrounds, skirmishes, arenas, and rated battlegrounds due to way gear is handled in PvP in Legion. Item level will not have as much impact in PvP which throws off the balance of relic itemization. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Re WoW/RPGs, do you think race/class limits provide better lore than any conceivable combo and justifying lore to go w/ it?
If I understand the question, I always felt held hostage to making races essentially cosmetic. OccupyGStreet 
That includes concerns for power racial bonuses, player agency I want to be a gnome paladin, or lore. OccupyGStreet
