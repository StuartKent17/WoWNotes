Warlords of Draenor - Mage and Monk Tier 17 Armor Sets<br>
The latest alpha build added the Mythic version of the Mage and Monk Tier 17 Armor sets. <br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor changes things up slightly by using one set of art for Raid Finder, one set of art for Normal and Heroic, and one set of art for Mythic difficulty. You can find the Raid Finder armor sets in our Raid Finder armor sets preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3940-Warlords-of-Draenor-Raid-Finder-Armor-Sets-Draenei-Guard-Armor-Set-Blue-Tweets-Art). <br>

Bloody Coin Hotfix Clarifications<br>
Recently, several changes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/319653-recent-bloody-coins-hotfixes/) have been made to how Bloody Coins are acquired. Lore provided some more information on the changes recently.<br>
&quot;more atractive&quot; reads higher rate of acquiring them or chance to gain on HK as well as KB? And could you share the actual chances?<br>
Previously, there was a 10 second ICD on getting a coin from a killing blow. That&apos;s been reduced significantly.<br>
You&apos;ll only hit the ICD now if you&apos;re up to some serious exploit-y shenanigans. (Source (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/477485547259449344))<br>
But will there be any chance of getting one on a HK? Healers would like to get coins too you know<br>
Spoke with dev: not technically feasible atm. Opens up a ton of potential exploits (ie: AFK farming coins)<br>
Would have to significantly rework the entire Bloody Coin mechanic to avoid those issues.<br>
BUT: We recognize that healers got the short end here, and it&apos;s a lesson learned for the future.<br>
So....besides Ashran then, any hope for us getting those coin rewards then short of pew pew? <br>
Not for Bloody Coins, unfortunately. But we&apos;ll do better in future mechanics. (Source (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/477514500199813120))<br>

<br>
Patch 5.4.8 Hotfixes - June 13<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Censer of Eternal Agony (http://www.wowdb.com/items/102467-censer-of-eternal-agony) now has a cooldown of 1 hour when used (up from 10 minutes).<br>
Fire-Watcher&apos;s Oath (http://www.wowdb.com/items/102463-fire-watchers-oath) now has a cooldown of 10 minutes (down from 1 hour) and costs 100 Timeless Coins to purchase (costs 50 Bloody Coins previously). The Ordon Fire-Watcher transformation now allows mount usage and Druid shapeshifting and significantly reduced the internal cooldown on earning Bloody Coins.<br>
<br>
<br>
Timeless Isle<br>
<br>
Non-rare creatures and NPCs on lower areas of Timeless Isle should now respawn more frequently.<br>

Does resolve have reduced gains when tanking multiple targets? Or is that done since it isn&apos;t cheesing DPS?<br>
Currently, yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474747892926668801))<br>
<br>
Any chance you could allow potions to not break stealth so it is easier to pre-pot and get an opener?<br>
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/475159103522615296))<br>

Without Heart Strike, what&apos;s going to make Blood DKs attacks different from Unholy in WoD?<br>
I don&apos;t really understand. They have hardly any overlap at all. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474722056643170304))<br>
Aside from the passive fx of blood, using Pest and Death Strike, and filling with Death Coil doesn&apos;t really seem dif from UH<br>
Death Coil is similar. Pestilence is shared but used in completely different ways. Everything else is completely different. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474723211364409346))<br>

Do Aimed Shot MultiStrikes benefit from Careful Aim? Is this behavior consistent with similar circumstances?<br>

any chance that you combine recuperate n slice into a single spell to facilitate use rogue finishmoves, giving us a bit of surv<br>

are you taking out the warlock green fire quest in 6.0?<br>
Nope. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/475395439642951680))<br>
And you get a Feat of Strength in 6.0 for having completed it before then?<br>
Before Draenor unlocks, yes. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/475398935331086336))<br>

With Garrosh gone, why are most of Horde buildings still following this horrendous &quot;Ten thousand iron spike&quot; idea?<br>
Garrosh didn&apos;t invent spikes, WC3 orc farm was spiky before it was cool. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/475069494377725952))<br>
But, not iron buildings, steel spikes, dried molten rooftops.. It was made with tents, wooden spikes... Tribal - not metallic.<br>
Consider it the industrial revolution for the horde (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/475072337927086082))<br>

Warlords of Draenor Stats<br>
Is Versatility not the best stat for fistweavers?<br>
Not the best healing throughput stat; it doesn&apos;t double-dip. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474720353227259906))<br>
<br>
(1/2) If an ability critically hits and procs MS, does MS do 30% of crit or 30% of normal hit dmg. Seems that crit is the only<br>
The damage (including crit or not) of the initial hit has no impact of the damage of the multistrike hit. Separate damage roll (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/475043018374803456))<br>
<br>
How will haste effect our GCDs in WoD? With OP gone our quick filler at 1 sec will make us feel clunky =/<br>
Haste reduces your GCD. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/475057905847517184))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
what gets me is, JP acquisition is TOO LOW pre nerf, wtf?<br>
When is the last time either of you direct-queued (NOT random) for a Normal mode scenario? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/474741856819879936))<br>
<br>
when i tried grinding JP for heirlooms, I gave up quickly because of high costs, and low JP rates.<br>
How long ago was that? Nowadays you get 100 JP per individual dungeon boss. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/474744430990082048))<br>
<br>
is it me or doesn&apos;t the tentacle showing up mean its part of the old gods<br>
The Twilight&apos;s Hammer cultists are deeply connected to the Old Gods, and they&apos;re the ones who occupy BFD. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/475294289896144896))<br>
<br>
Will revamped BFD/RFD/RFK have level 100 H/CM versions, or just their existing low-level ones?<br>
Low-level only; just showing some love to a few dungeons that felt a bit dated. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/475295194964041728))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
With all the requests for skirmishes through the years you all better play the ever loving crap out of them now that they&apos;re in game. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475096853671718913))<br>
<br>
Thought you guys were looking to improve PvP participation. Making the sets identical feels really lazy.<br>
I love how people throw the word &quot;lazy&quot; around without any insight into how hard people are working. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/474956963176919040))<br>
<br>
are we really going back to where the PvP gear is the same exact model as the PvE gear in WoD? If so why?<br>
Armor sets have lost a lot of aspirational value at the high end. We want higher tier content to reward cooler looking gear. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/474957916726763520))<br>
So to clarify the tier 17 armor sets are also the season 16 PvP armor sets?<br>
Yes, but Mythic looks better than Normal/Heroic and Elite looks better than normal conquest. Also, it&apos;s Warlords Season 1. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/474960380704223232))<br>
<br>
Any plan to add some missing old school pvp stuff? (first cata set, boot belt bracers,LK pvp and MoP weapon)?thx for answr<br>
We&apos;d like to, just a lot of other work that feels more important. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/474960784745709569))<br>
<br>
.since it&apos;s been a bit over a week, any news on how the free faction changed has been working so far?<br>
My understanding is that there hasn&apos;t been any significant problems with the process. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475006866875899904))<br>
<br>
So because Mythic difficulty gets different models, PvP gets gimped with re-used PvE models now? Come on<br>
By your logic, you could say because Elite gear gets different models, PvE gets gimped with re-used PvP models. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475006245020000256))<br>
PvP is not getting the short end of the stick. Higher skill/commitment is being further rewarded in PvP &amp; PvE. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475008499684880384))<br>
Mythic difficulty AND Elite PvP gear gets different models. This is a really strange attitude you&apos;re coming from (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475006031387316224))<br>
I would rather see PvP get different models and Elite get a recolor of those models instead of PvE&gt;PvP recolor.<br>
that&apos;s what we have now and it&apos;s underwhelming. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475010905517076482))<br>
Better rewards for top players is awesome and i applaud it, but recolored PvE sets for 95%&gt; of all PvPers is also underwhelming.<br>
Calling them &quot;recolored PvE sets&quot; is a huge mis-characterization. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475013818091700225))<br>
I feel like this could use some clarification. Mythic and elite pvp use same model/different color or no?<br>
different color (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475403857527201792))<br>
<br>
is Ashran playable in the alpha yet? If not will you let us know when it is? WTB Ashran blog!!!<br>
It isn&apos;t ready for public testing yet...but we&apos;re about to do our largest internal test to date. Does that help? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475012870564884480))<br>
<br>
I mean, do you plan to squish the entire thing more if necessary ?<br>
We wanted to shrink base resilience down to 0% which meant inflating health pools more than originally expected. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475094603628949504))<br>
<br>
Is pvp power necessary with different pvp and pve ilvls?<br>
Nope (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475318980195143680))<br>

Ah I still have so much to explore in Frostfire. Hit 92, think 4/6 story done, but so many things to still hunt down!<br>
Exploratory gaming is huge for us this round, hope you&apos;re finding it fun! We&apos;re not nearly done though &gt;=] (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/475070702488268800))<br>

when my pet kills a mob on its own, I don&apos;t get loot.. will this ever be changed? really annoying when soloing old stuff<br>
Unlikely to change that; it&apos;d expose exploits. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/475377463816491014))<br>
is that the same reason it happens with other &quot;non active&quot; sources; lightning shield, etc?<br>
Yes. Damage that you can do with no input should not count for loot rights. Prevents afk farming. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/475384985990356992))<br>
<br>
World<br>
Yes there are rare spawns, lots of them, more than ever before! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/475154934389039104))<br>
If they are common, can they be rare?<br>
Levelup rares are meant to be encountered, endgame are more rare. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/475159584882298880))<br>
Currently in alpha once a rare is killed its respawn isnt rare to that character anymore. Is this what you meant by &quot;encountered&quot;?<br>
Yep! You always get the reward the first time, no need to farm it for loot/XP (plenty others to hunt), visually represented. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/475194836099031040))<br>
A lot of the alpha rares need their &quot;no-tap&quot; flag set, they should all operate like Timeless Isle rares. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/475199305528393728))<br>
