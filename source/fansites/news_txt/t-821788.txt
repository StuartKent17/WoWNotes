Boubouille2010-12-30, 09:01 AMMini update for today's official announcement, I'm still going through most of the submissions from the guide contest and should be done in a few hours. After that, I'll announce the winners and release their guides on the front page over the next few days to keep you guys busy during the holidays. I might end up offering a few more prizes than intended ... 

Also, if you were late and couldn't send your guide before the deadline. Send them in PM, you won't qualify for the contest but if the guide is very very awesome I might consider extra minor prizes. I insist on the "very awesome"

Rated BGs Now Award Honor at Conquest Cap
We've recently made a change in an effort to promote continued play in Rated Battlegrounds. Now when a player is at their weekly Conquest cap they will receive the full amount of Honor from kills, objective completions, victories and losses while in a Rated Battleground match. Those not at their cap will continue to earn Conquest normally, and will only earn Honor once they reach their weekly cap.

Whether you’re capped and others on your team aren’t, or you’re all capped and just want to keep playing, we hope this change will allow more flexibility for those participating in Rated Battlegrounds.
