MMO-Champion "Be nice, not naughty!" Giveaway
It's almost Christmas! All the WoW players around the world are happy and busy being nice to everyone they know and don't know in-game! ... Ok, most of you aren't that nice and I heard that Santa's "naughty" list is getting longer and longer with so many people gearing up in PuG/random instances. : 

That's why Christmas and the holidays is a wonderful time to change that behavior, especially if you can get free stuff just by being nice!

Prizes
A lot of these items were kindly offered by WoWTCGLoot.com , thanks to them! 


1 x X-51 Nether-Rocket X-TREME  - Yep. You can win a super awesome rocket mount!
1 x Mega Pack of your choice on Steam Holiday Sale ! Yep, I'm talking about the 13/14/15th page, and no, I won't get mad at you if you pick the expensive $80 one. 
1 x Ethereal Portal  - An item replacing your Heartstone by an awesome Ethereal portal!
1 x Goblin Weather Machine  - For those of you who want snow on Christmas! 
1 x World of Warcraft Pet: Lil Ragnaros 
1 x World of Warcraft® Pet: Moonkin Hatchling 
1 x World of Warcraft® Pet: Pandaren Monk

1 x World of Warcraft® Pet: Lil’ XT 
1 x World of Warcraft® Mount: Celestial Steed 
10 x Curse Premium  accounts, because updating all your addons instantly in just one click is awesome! 


I never joke when it comes to being nice, and this is definitely the biggest giveaway to date! 


Giveaway Rules
This giveaway is very simple and will require you to do 3 simple things.

1. Join a random instance group through the /lfd tool, any level is fine it doesn't have to be a Cataclysm dungeon. When you arrive in the instance you have to:

Say hello to the members of the group. Any language is fine
Wish them Happy Holidays/a Merry Christmas! 


2. You have to finish the instance with that same group, I'm expecting you to kill the last boss and finish the instance instead of quitting after the first wipe. Let's say that two members are allowed to change over the course of the instance because you can't control other people ragequitting over stupid things but it won't happen if you're nice!

At the end of the instance:

Say goodbye to the members of the group and thanks them for their time. 
Wish them Happy Holidays/a Merry Christmas again!


3. Post on the MMO-Champion "Be nice, not naughty!" Giveaway - Screenshots Thread !-quot-Giveaway-Screenshots?p=9880587#post9880587 the two screenshots of 1. and 2. to show the world how nice you are. After you're done with that, you will officially be on the list of the people nice enough to be picked for free stuff! One post per user allowed

4. Winners will be picked on December 26th at 08:00PM GMT based on their post numbers. If there are 2437 replies at the end of the giveaway, I will do a /random 1-2437 either in-game or on a random number generator site and will select winners based on their post number!

I will finish this post with the most adorable artwork ever, posted on the forums by Equilibrioception  Good luck to everyone, and Merry Christmas!
