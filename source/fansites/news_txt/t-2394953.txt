Mage Tower Appearances
If that's true, then, given that you believe there's still plenty of time to get the Mage Tower appearances, how do you feel about the amount of time players have left to obtain the Prestige skins?
Prestige artifact appearances aren't going away and will still be obtainable.

The only appearances that will be no longer obtainable after Legion ends will be the Mage Tower appearances and the three other skins within that row, since you need the first appearance to unlock the other three, and the +15 appearance.

Protection Warrior Numerical Analysis
Disclaimer: this is sort of analysis is necessarily rough--beyond these basic estimates, talents and many other things will affect mitigation and overall tank performance in any given context.

Disclaimer 2: I didn't review your calculations or assumptions, but the approach seems reasonable.

Even based on your own conclusions, you're greatly downplaying the Warrior's mitigation advantage in your example. "Only 6.64%" is a very large difference when the Druid is only taking 33.57% of incoming damage in the first place. The Warrior who's taking 26.93% of incoming damage is taking 19.8% less damage than a Druid. 19.8% is a very large mitigation advantage--it amounts to a 25% increase in effective health, which is very close to the 29% higher health the Druid has in your example.

Can we get some clarification on the inner workings of Bone Shield on BFA Beta? Stacks seem to drop much quicker in multi-target situations than on Live. Has the type of things that remove stacks been changed, or the internal CD reduced/removed?
In the Battle for Azeroth Beta, Bone Shield still has a 2-second internal cooldown on losing stacks. If you spot a bug, please try to give us as much detail as possible. Thank you!

Can you explain what's the interaction between Downpour and Deluge in Battle for Azeroth for Restoration Shamans? If there is interaction, if not, it's like losing a talent?
As of the next build of the Battle for Azeroth Beta, this should no longer be an issue, since Downpour no longer replaces Healing Rain. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/991087279417344000

PvP
If prestige is going account wide, does that mean artifacts appearances or color variations are unlocked in all characters once BfA begins?
Yes, if you unlock an appearance that requires an account-wide Prestige level, all of your characters will get that appearance. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/991090346300915712
In Battle for Azeroth, all of your Prestige levels are going to merge. So if you have three characters who reached Prestige 4 in Legion, your account will be set to Prestige 12 in Battle for Azeroth. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/991798484956102656

Professions
In BfA will we have to relearn crafts from previous expansions?
In Battle for Azeroth, any crafts you’ve learned in the past will still be there and not need to be re-learned, with the exception of First Aid. Tailoring and Alchemy crafts, bandages, and anti-venoms that used to be in First Aid will have to be re-learned. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/976599336325754880

PvE
Uldir only has 8 raid bosses? In the past we had NH, TOV and EN for Legion, TOES, HOF and MSV for MoP, TOTF, BOT and BWD for Cata, as you can see so far it's very concerning you'll be going down the WoD route with less raids.
Highmaul had 7 bosses; Nightmare had 7. Uldir has 8. Much of Nighthold was in data at Legion launch, but it didn't open until months later so it doesn't really offer a true parallel. I will say that we're pretty happy with the quantity of raid content that Legion offered. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/973254342055575553

"With the Azerite system, you're not going to see the big inflated numbers we had in Legion" -WatcherDev That's weird, I don't remember checking out MMO-Champ and seeing scientific notation. 
You're looking at datamined internal tables out of context. The current plan is for you to be collecting 3-digit quantities of Artifact Power and working towards 4-digit and 5-digit goals pretty much all expansion long. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/986805287402127360

Testing shows “Vectis” raid test this week, but there is currently no such boss in journal, npcs, anywhere really. it doesn’t exist. Not even in todays build that got reverted. Is this a boss rename? If so, what boss?
Vectis is the boss formerly known as “Blood of G’huun”. Other references will be updated in a future build of the Battle for Azeroth Beta. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/991360502965063681

Island Expeditions
How bout the ai? They're kinda dumb and squishy. Mobs too, but that was expected. I want the ai to make me go " oh no they didnt!" instead of " they're dead."
On Normal, that's kind of expected, on H/M it should be scarier! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/987011180748193792

And the much-promised account-wide unlock/level your alts on islands as well and please let us know how it feels to level, the xp probably isn't great atm but we'll fix it. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/987010955518164992
wait, WHAT?????
Do unlock quest at 115 on one character -> islands for all your 110-120 doods. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/987011844199014400

Curious if you are discussing player behavior like we saw in Ashran where Alliance would control the road while Horde farmed the perimeter. Also I see the goal is to get 6000, what will the losing team get.
The overall amount of stuff is limited and doesn't respawn, so we haven't really seen this. You're forced to clash eventually! Losing team still gets Artifact Power based on how much they collected, we don't want it to feel really bad to lose. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/987014446076719104

Pet Battles
Will scaled enemy pets have access to all their skills? Will there be an incentive to use max level pets for WQ's if it turns out to be easier to do the quests with level 1 teams?
They don't have all of their skills, but do have buffed stats, so it may be more difficult to fight them at low level but worth the XP. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/989281427710607360

Misc
Is Moonrest Shore still in Val'sharah? I think it might have been there at launch and replaced with Verdant Cliffs falcosaur area, but there doesn't seem to be any information anywhere about it.
Moonrest Shore was an early name for Moonrest. The thinking was that you could see the shore from there. But you can't, really, because the trees block your view of the shore. Which is fine. They're lovely trees. Very restful. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/976598403420311554

Maybe I am one of the very few players that is a sucker for stats, but you still haven't added Seething Shore to the PvP/Battleground statistics list. At least the win/loss ratio would be nice, maybe even captured Azerite.
This was a bug that we're working to fix in Battle for Azeroth.Thank you. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/991088348650328064
