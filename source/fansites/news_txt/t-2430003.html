Reddit AMA Feedback<br>
Hi. Just for some additional context in advance of this AMA: I suggested and volunteered to do this, and I&apos;m looking forward to it. I know there are a ton of questions and concerns that feel unanswered right now, and a need for much more robust communication on our end. I am accountable for everything that goes into WoW, so that should begin with me. A standard streamed Q&amp;A wouldn&apos;t really be sufficient to cover the range of topics that are likely to come up, since we&apos;re limited in the number of questions we can fit in. And a forum post or blog would end up as a giant wall of text that doesn&apos;t feel much like a conversation. So r/wow felt like the perfect place to address a wide range of topics in an open forum.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m planning on spending at least a couple of hours responding, and I&apos;ll try to cover as much as I can. It&apos;ll just be me tanking this, so apologies in advance if I can&apos;t field a question about the nuances of Swift Roundhouse interactions for Windwalkers, or whatever.<br>
<br>
Also, to be clear, we don&apos;t view a one-off AMA as a silver bullet. It&apos;s impossible for everyone to agree with every decision we make, but you shouldn&apos;t feel unaware of them or disconnected from why we chose a given course to follow, and that will take a sustained effort on our part.

<br>
Then perhaps it&apos;s time to upgrade your own? It boggles my mind to see a blue say something like this. Basically your saying, &quot;Ya, their platform for communicating is better than ours so we hang out there&quot;.<br>
<br>
That thought crossed my mind. I thought they were going to be upgrading these forums, I&apos;m not sure what the status of that project is. The funny thing is that Twitter and Reddit are far more toxic than these forums ever were, I&apos;m a little confused about the stated reasons.<br>
This is very much still in the works. Even though new forums are coming soon&#x2122; these new ones still wouldn&apos;t be able to accommodate this specific style. There are merits to both styles of forums, for WoW specifically I think this style is better. Considering we at most do an AMA there once a year or expansion almost, I don&apos;t think adopting that style is worth it for that convenience once a year. We can still just choose to format the questions and answers and repost here for you guys since its understandable that some folks don&apos;t like Reddit or Twitter. I&apos;d rather accommodate than force people to use a platform they don&apos;t like honestly and bring that content to them.</div></div>
