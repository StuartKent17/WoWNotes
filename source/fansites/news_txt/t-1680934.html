Blizzard Sending Gift to Veteran Accounts<br>
It looks like Blizzard is planning to send some kind of gift players that have had an account for ten years. A few players have received a notification that a package from Blizzard will be arriving tomorrow. There was a support article about the gift that was taken down shortly after it was posted. <br>
<br>
We don&apos;t know if the requirements from the support article are the only requirements. So far, all of the people that have received a notification have been subscribed almost all of the full ten years.<br>
<br>
If you think you are eligible and haven&apos;t received a notification, don&apos;t worry! This hasn&apos;t been officially announced or confirmed yet. The only shipment notifications that have gone out are from UPS. Blizzard has not sent any emails yet. <br>
<br>
If you happen to receive the gift, be sure to post some pictures of it in the comments!<br>

Tenth Anniversary Physical Gift<br>
As a way of thanking our loyal World of Warcraft players, we will send a physical gift to players who have been playing with us since the beginning. Players who are eligible have received an email at the address listed on their Battle.net accounts. If you did not receive that email, your account is not eligible for this gift.<br>
<br>
These gifts were sent to physical addresses of eligible registered Battle.net accounts. To be eligible for this gift, a player must have created a World of Warcraft account within 60 days of the game&apos;s release in America or Europe.<br>
<br>
Eligible players in America have received tracking information for the shipment of the gift. Eligible players in Europe will receive tracking information when your gifts are sent throughout the month. If the shipping address in the email is incorrect, you will need to contact us with the updated address.<br>
