US Realms Extended Downtime
Our regularly scheduled Tuesday maintenance will begin at 3:00AM PDT, April 29, and end at approximately 11:00AM PDT. During this time all realms will be down and not accessible for play. 

We will be performing maintenance on the forums on Tuesday April 29, from 5:00AM PDT to 8:00AM PDT. During this time players will not be able to login to the forums but will be able to read them as usual. Source ;jsessionid=6BEEDB2F71A672316F13DC5E2CF1A8BB.app09_06?topicId=6214101843&sid=1

Tuesday's maintenance will be an extended one for the US Realms, even if it could be the sign of a 2.4.2 Patch release I wouldn't really expect it only one week after the deployment of the patch on test servers. However, with the forums down as well, you'll have plenty of free time and you might want to read the 2.4.2 changes post, it will probably keep you busy for a few minutes.
2.4.2 Patch Notes  Updated April 25th
