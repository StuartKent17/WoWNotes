Much like Patch 7.3 in Legion, Rise of Azshara offers a variety of new recipes and items to craft or gather.<br>
<br>
<br>
All Kul Tiran and Zandalari professions have an additional 25 points added to the cap, for a total of 175 from 150.<br>
New recipes have been added to each profession that require these new 25 points.<br>
All gathering professions have new materials to collect.<br>
There are items you can find in Nazjatar that unlock specific profession focused events. Activating these events will have you complete a task and provide a bounty of materials or benefits for your profession.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Abyssal Focus<br>
In Nazjatar, crafters will build up a new crafting station called the Abyssal Focus. This forge is used to craft the new raid gar instead of using consumables from the raid such as Sanguicell (https://www.wowdb.com/items/162461-sanguicell).<br>
<br>
<br>
A series of quests increase the rank of the focus.<br>
<br>
Restored Abyssal Focus - Crafts up to Item level 410 gear<br>
Empowered Abyssal Focus - Crafts up to Item level 425 gear<br>
Radiating Abyssal Focus - Crafts up to Item level 440 gear<br>
<br>
Quests<br>
<br>
The first quest to restore the focus is Ancient Technology (https://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/56346-ancient-technology).<br>
After you have to collect 15 Abyssal Shard (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/169326-abyssal-shard) for the quest An Abyssal Opportunity (https://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/56347-an-abyssal-opportunity) to upgrade it.<br>
You then are given the quest We Can Make It Stronger... (https://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/56352-we-can-make-it-stronger) and are sent into Azshara&apos;s Eternal Palace to collect Eternal Ornament (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/169329-eternal-ornament).<br>
There is likely another step involving the raid after this quest as the previous quest only unlocks the Empowered Abyssal Focus.<br>
<br>
Once you unlock the next rank, you can craft any gear at the focus of the allowed item level or below.<br>
