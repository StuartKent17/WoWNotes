WotLK FAQ -   + Wrath Launch Center 

Raid Instances
Three raid instances are available at the release of Wrath of the Lich King, Naxxramas, The Eye of Eternity, and The Obsidian Sanctum. All 3 pages have been updated with a few details on the encounter and a full loot list, sets are in a different page to make reading easier. 


 
     


5-Man Dungeons
All the pages for 5-man dungeons had their summary greatly improved in the past few days, they're obviously not as complete I would like them to be but well ... You're most likely going to run through them in less than 30 minutes anyway. 


   
   
   
   
   
   


PvP Zones and Gear
Probably the less up to date pages ... But if you've been reading this site for some time you know the basics of Lake Wintergrasp and Strand of the Ancients. The Season 5 gear list is fairly complete.
