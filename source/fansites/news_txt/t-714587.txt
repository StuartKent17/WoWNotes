Apparently, a few people are interested in that "Cataclysm" thing and I guess it's time for an update of what's going on.

The Alpha is protected by a Non-disclosure agreement , which basically means that anything I could post could get me sued. I'm not saying it will happen, Blizzard has been fairly forgiving with everything posted on the site in this past but I think you will understand that I cannot just post everything I find without checking a few things first. 

For the moment, Alpha related posts on the forums aren't moderated it would be stupid to think we can moderate all the posts about it but people trying to scam or spread false rumors will be rewarded with a 3 months ban from the forums. Anyone linking or advertising emulation/cheating sites will be permanently banned from the forums. 

And because you're all going to ask anyway, yes, the Deathwing model posted everywhere on the forums is real.
