Earlier this month I said that I planned to reset the Hall of Fame to reflect the recent buffs to Ulduar bosses. After a few days I actually changed my mind and decided to keep it as it is now and not change it. All guilds had access to the nerfed version at the same time and we can&apos;t really create a new ranking everytime a boss is changed, we would just create one every day. <br>
<br>
The Hall of Fame (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=864) is now up to date, but I would like to mention a few kills of the buffed versions of the hard modes:<br>
Method (http://www.methodwow.com/) killed the buffed version of Freya&apos;s hard mode. <br>
Ensidia (http://www.ensidia.com/home/news/Ensidia-Ulduar-Hardmode.html) killed Freya a bit later, and also Thorim during the same night. <br>
For The Horde (http://www.for-the-horde.eu/) killed Thorim as well.<br>
<br>
Replenishment Change For Arenas<br>
We are making a hotfix (any minute now probably) so that Replenishment in arenas will only affect the character and not the whole team. It will continue to function as it does currently outside of arenas.<br>
<br>
We feel Replenishment is balanced for larger groups, but just makes too much of a difference on smaller arena teams. Making the rules work differently in PvP and PvE isn&#x2019;t a solution we like to use often, but in this case we think it fixes the issue cleanly, while still making the talents in question useful to the character who takes them. Alternatives, such as nerfing the amount returned by Replenishment in arena or making it not function at all, seem like more punitive choices from which we want to stay away. <br>
<br>
Recent In-Game Fixes - 04/23<br>
Listed below are recent fixes we have applied to the game. Keep in mind that some of these changes may not be active until after the realm has been restarted. <br>
<br>
Fear Ward will now properly be consumed whether a player is sitting or standing.<br>
The Rogue talent Savage Combat should now properly be removed after leaving an arena match.<br>
Greater Blessing of Wisdom and Mana Spring Totem will no longer stack as intended.<br>
The trash mobs before XT-002 Deconstructor have gone through additional changes that should make them a little easier to get through.<br>
The Ocular in Icecrown should be killable again using the quest item Eyesoar Blaster.<br>
The quests &quot;Shatter the Shards&quot; and &quot;The Guardians of Corp&apos;rethar&#x201D; should be completable again whether or not you are involved in Argent Tournament quests.<br>
The trash mobs before Mimiron have gone through additional changes that should make them a little easier to get through.<br>
The Priest ability Serendipity is now properly consumed when a spell finishes casting and does not affect a second spell.<br>
Nature&#x2019;s Swiftness should properly affect Rebirth.<br>
The damage of XT-002 Deconstructor&#x2019;s Gravity Bomb ability has been reduced.<br>

Mana regeneration in 3.1<br>
You are rarely in a situation to compare Int and Spirit directly. More often you are choosing say Spirit vs. Crit, and Crit is already much better for Balance druids. I don&apos;t know that many priests really stack Spirit because of the Innervate potential, so a change like this wouldn&apos;t affect them much (though I get your point overall).<br>
<br>
Really though the greater issue is that we don&apos;t put a lot of regen stats on PvP gear, and ultimately we don&apos;t want to. That makes Innervate a lot better in PvE than PvP. PvP Balance druids seem to have mana problems. Solving that through Innervate, the ability you get that, you know, is supposed to give you mana, is an attractive solution.<br>
<br>
This is a bigger discussion, but we have muddied the waters by converting Int into a regen stat and Spirit into a damage stat for so many casters. Long term, we would like to clean that up somewhat. Regen in general has always been just a little too confusing in WoW. We think we can make it a more straight-forward concept without losing any depth.

Stealth nerfs in 3.1? <br>
A true stealth nerf would be something we were trying to hide, or at least waiting to see if players discovered it. There aren&apos;t many changes like that, particularly in this day and age. When we make hotfixes, we are patching the server. This isn&apos;t a big orchestrated change like launching a new client patch so we don&apos;t always know the exact minute or second when the change goes in.<br>
<br>
If it&apos;s something we intended, we&apos;ll let you know pretty quickly. If it&apos;s a bug, we&apos;ll let you know once we figure out if it&apos;s going on.<br>
<br>
We made changes to Conflagrate, Death Strike and Exorcism lately. We have not made any changes to shaman damage, hunter trap arming time or many of the other questions that have popped up lately. If any of those are bugs, we&apos;ll let you know as we verify that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16474152752-i-didnt-know-the-customer-had-to-ask.html))<br>

Innervate<br>
Part of the problem is that Innervate scales with buffs. So we can either have it give too much mana in PvE or too little in PvP. Right now it&apos;s the latter -- we&apos;re pretty happy with Balance mana regen in Ulduar, but it&apos;s too low in PvP.<br>
<br>
We&apos;d like to make a change where Innervate always restrores about the same total mana (say 15,000 at level 80). That&apos;s good for PvP but not overpowered for PvE, and has the added bonus of being more useful to non-Spirit based casters as well. &quot;Innervating the hunter!&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16474162276-pvp-moonkin-mana-regen-is-utterly-broken.html))<br>

Paladin mechanics<br>
We&apos;re not talking about combo points here. But we keep running into problems with say Judgement, Divine Storm, Crusader Strike, and now (until recently) Exorcism and perhaps even Hammer of Wrath all being unrelated. You can use one per global cooldown leading to just a ton of damage without there being much an opponent can really do. There is no poison or disease to cleanse. There isn&apos;t a self buff someone can remove. They often don&apos;t even have time to respond because the attacks are coming right on top of each other. Yes the abilities all have cooldowns, but that&apos;s small consolation to someone who may be in triple digit health by the time you unload.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, it&apos;s not like there is much skill involved to that rotation (&quot;GC SEZ RETS R FACEROLLERZ&quot;). You hit the buttons and damage happens. Sure you can come up with other situations where a player just hits their buttons and unloads a lot, but in a lot of cases they do have other considerations to deal with. Warriors have to watch Overpower opportunities. Enhancement shamans want to follow up Stormstrike with Nature damage. Frost mages want the Frost Nova (or whatever) before the Ice Lance.<br>
<br>
To some extent, Holy paladins even have the same issues. Simple does not have to mean boring. Having few buttons doesn&apos;t have to mean having few options.<br>
<br>
Again, we&apos;ve come a long way with paladins. Their aren&apos;t horribly broken. No class is. They just need a little more tweaking. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16473622306-concerns-about-ret.html))<br>
