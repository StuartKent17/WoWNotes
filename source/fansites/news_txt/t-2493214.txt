No one is immune from death—no one except the people of Mechagon. At least, that’s what the stories say. Most gnomes think Mechagon is just a far-fetched legend, but not the old, scarred explorer Kervo. After years of obsessive research, he has set off on what might be his final adventure: a daring gambit to find Mechagon and uncover the secrets of immortality before his own time runs out. 

Discover the mysteries that await in “Mechagon,” written by Matt Burns and illustrated by Miki Montlló. Download and read the latest standalone Battle for Azeroth comic here
