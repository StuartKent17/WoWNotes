The BlizzCon 2018 Virtual Ticket is now available for purchase and if you’re a World of Warcraft fan you won’t want to miss a moment of the event—or the WoW extras that come with it, including epic in-game goodies and access to the Blizzcon WoW Classic demo at home!

World of Warcraft® Classic BlizzCon® Demo
Every BlizzCon, we look for opportunities to bring new aspects of the experience to our community around the world. This year, we’re excited to announce that for the first time ever, BlizzCon Virtual Ticket holders will join BlizzCon attendees as the first people to play the World of Warcraft Classic demo we’re creating for BlizzCon at home.

Shortly after the BlizzCon opening ceremony on November 2 on or around 1pm PDT, players will be able to download the same in-development BlizzCon WoW Classic Demo that will be playable on the show floor. Players will have a chance to explore and enjoy a limited questing experience through a pair of classic early-level zones—one Horde and one Alliance—and experience firsthand our recreation of the original Azeroth.

Once the demo is live, you’ll be able to play until 10am PST on November 8, giving BlizzCon attendees a chance to check it out again once they get back home.

Declare Your Allegiance With BlizzCon In-Game Loot
In addition to access to the BlizzCon WoW Classic Demo, starting today BlizzCon attendees and Virtual Ticket holders will receive commemorative in-game items that will help them proudly display their Horde or Alliance pride as the Battle for Azeroth rages on:


War Mantle of the Alliance & War Mantle of the Horde: Show all of Azeroth where your allegiance lies with a pair of faction-themed cosmetic cloaks—one for Horde characters, and one for Alliance.
Stormwind Champion’s War Banner & Orgrimmar Hero’s War Banner: Strike fear into your enemies and stand your ground when you plant your faction’s banner on the battlefield.


In addition to this year’s WoW items and access to the BlizzCon WoW Classic demo, the Virtual Ticket provides plenty of great BlizzCon content for your viewing pleasure along with additional in-game goodies from Overwatch®, Diablo® III, Hearthstone®, Heroes of the Storm®, and StarCraft® II.
