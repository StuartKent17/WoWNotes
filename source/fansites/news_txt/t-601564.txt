It looked like a good idea at the beginning, but it seems that premade characters are a problem for Blizzard. Current status is : 

US Realms : Errors when you're trying to confirm the copy.
EU Realms : Page not even available. 

The only official statement available is : 
We are aware that the Pre-made character copy page is displaying an error. This is being investigated.
