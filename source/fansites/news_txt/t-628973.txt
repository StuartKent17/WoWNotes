Boubouille2009-01-06, 10:38 AMPatch 3.0.8 not going live today
The european server message was updated  a few minutes ago with the following: 
Weekly Maintenance, 07/01
This Wednesday there will be a live maintenance, i.e. rolling restarts of all realms between 05:00 and 07:00 CET. Each realm will receive a 15 minute notice prior to being restarted. Thank you for your patience and understanding.
The patch is definitely not going live in Europe tomorrow, there isn't any reason to see it on US servers this week. You can go back to a normal life for one more week.
