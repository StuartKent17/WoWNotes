Druids changes in latest PTR build<br>
It seems that Remove Curse is now usable in Tree of Life form for Druids in the latest PTR build.<br>
<br>
Mages : Ice Block trainable<br>
Ice block will be trainable in the future, but the change might not be included in the 2.3 patch. Also, the change made to hypothermia in the latest PTR Build is confirmed. Mana issues in long fight will also be looked at.<br>
It&apos;s a deliberate change. We initially felt like it was too quick at 30s and decided to test it out at 45s, but after playing with it for a while we felt like it opened mages to focus fire a little too much so we decided to keep it at 30s. It&apos;s worth pointing out that making changes like this and later un-doing them is not at all uncommon, it&apos;s just most of you generally don&apos;t see that process in action since it often happens before the patch even gets to the PTR.<br>
<br>
Since I&apos;m here, I&apos;ll also make a small pre-emptive strike against the incoming &quot;what about other mage concerns!&quot; replies I&apos;m about to get and say the following.<br>
<br>
Two things we&apos;ll be making improvements to in the near future (although these aren&apos;t likely to make it in on time for 2.3) are having iceblock be trainable (to make sure all mages have it as a tool for pve encounters and to open up other trees as being more viable options for pvp), and to-be-finalized improvements to mana issues in longer fights.<br>
<br>
We do plan to buff mana gems, although I don&apos;t see that as a &quot;fix&quot;, just an improvement that needs to be made regardless.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hunters : Aimed shot cast time reduced<br>
-0.5 sec on Aimed shot cast time, hurray ?<br>
In patch 2.3, aimed shot will not only reduces healing done to the target by 50% for a ten seconds, but we&apos;re also reducing the shot time by 0.5 seconds.<br>
<br>
<br>
2.4 Patch details soon<br>
Now that&apos;s a good news. For the moment the only thing we know about the 2.4 is the addition of Sunwell Isle to the game.<br>
If you want information on something soon, assuming patch 2.3 is launched next week as we announced, we should have details on patch 2.4 available in the near future. ;)<br>
