I already spent some time answering some mails, but a news might be a good way to prevent more of them. Here is the video.<br>

<br>
And here is the timeline, explaining why it&apos;s a big, huge, fake.<br>
<br>
00:00 : The human you see is only wearing the tier 4 warrior set and is using two glaves models that have been in game for a lot of time. (Same character (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/june/warglaive.jpg) in WoWModelViewer)<br>
00:29 : Badly photoshopped logo, it&apos;s just the classic logo recolored and with a few ice effects. <br>
00:35 : Wow ... Loading screen ! Hey wait, I think I already saw this one. Undead Campaign Screen (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/june/northrend_orly.jpg) in Warcraft 3.<br>
00:57 : Orc Warlock in a Tier 6 armor set, nothing new here. <br>
01:02 : A normal character selection screen with a new class ... This is just the Wisp Race icon (http://www.wowwiki.com/Wisp_%28April_Fools%29) used for the Blizzard&apos;s april fool joke in 2006.<br>
01:30 : Emerald Dream ... Nothing new, for example if you check this movie (http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=18319) you&apos;ll see the same thing, and it&apos;s one year old. It will probably be related to Northrend but it&apos;s not leaked from the expansion, just from current game files. <br>
02:34 : Northrend on world map, look like a stretched version of this fan map (http://www.wowwiki.com/Image:NorthrendingamemapByElrynn.jpg)<br>
02:40 : Northrend map, same as this fan map (http://www.wowwiki.com/Image:NorthrendInGame.jpg)<br>
02:45 : Cinematic ... From Warcraft 3, the Frozen throne, this is the first part of the ending cinematic. (Screenshot from the original (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/june/end1.jpg))<br>
03:18 : Map, I think it&apos;s from Warcraft 3 : FT too, but I&apos;m not sure about this one.<br>
03:22 : End of the cinematic used earlier. (Screenshot from the original (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/june/end2.jpg))<br>
