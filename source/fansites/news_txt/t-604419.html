If you read my news carefully you probably saw the screenshot of Sunwell loots I posted a few days ago and I probably was the first to publicly claim &quot;LOL FAKE !&quot;. <br>
<br>
However, it looked real, too real to not be checked and I spent the week trying to gather information in a few places, and it became very interesting. I can now say that these loots are most likely real, and you will probably see most of them in Sunwell Plateau. (95% chance to see them, I&apos;ll keep the 5% chance that they&apos;re fake just to feel secure) There is obviously no official source to confirm this, but most of you know that I wouldn&apos;t post this without a good reason. <br>
<br>
Items seems to be ilvl 154~155<br>
At least one of them is ilvl 164 (Apolyon, the Soul-render), we can assume it&apos;s a loot from Kil&apos;jaeden. I didn&apos;t try to get the ilvl for all items, maybe there are more loots from KJ. <br>
Even if they&apos;re legit, these stats are probably from early beta servers and could be changed/removed once the 2.4 patch is released on PTR. <br>
The feral staff is with the caster weapons, I know, I&apos;m not redoing the screenshot just because of that. :/<br>
Nothing is confirmed by Blizzard, trust it at your own risks. <br>
(Bonus) It seems that the Arena Season 4 sets will be named &quot;Brutal Gladiator&quot;. This one is still fairly unconfirmed though.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All these items are from the old screenshot posted a few days ago, I did a clean version to make it more readable. Here you go (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/sunwell_loots.jpg) ! <br>
<br>
Obviously, that&apos;s not all the Sunwell loots, there are many more that we&apos;ll be able to discover once the PTR patch is released ... soon ?<br>
