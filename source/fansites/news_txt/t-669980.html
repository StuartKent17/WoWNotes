The Faction Champions encounter in the normal 10-player and normal 25-player Trial of the Crusader instances have had a number of spells and abilities altered which should result in less overall damage.<br>
The Anub&apos;arak encounter has been changed on all difficulties. Anub&#x2019;arak now attacks faster, the Nerubian Burrowers should hit a little harder, and their Expose Weakness ability now caps at 9 stacks. (MMO-Champion Note : Apparently the spell now increases damage taken by 25%, down from 30% - Expose Weakness (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/67721/))<br>
Some season 7 arena weapons will now have a socket.<br>
Threat of Thassarian will now properly halve the damage of Rune Strike for the off-hand strike.<br>
Soulstone Resurrection now fades upon entering raid combat if the character who cast it is not present.<br>
The Idle/Inactive debuff is now cleared upon round switches in Strand of the Ancients.<br>
The Mistress of Pain will now target more accurately in the 25 man Heroic Jaraxxus encounter.<br>
The damage of Hunter&#x2019;s Volley ability has been increased.</div></div>
