Enchanting
Some of these enchants were already changed in a previous patch, I didn't merge the list with the old one to prevent any confusion. If an enchantment is in both list, this one is the most recent and will most likely be on live servers But keep in mind that anything can change on PTRs, that's what happened with some of these enchants

Featured Addons â€“ Issue 2 - ClassTimer By Trell ;u=5774
Time for another featured addon - and this is truly one that I couldn't ever live without now. It's called ClassTimer.

ClassTimer will give you timer bars for your relevant skills - for example, Polymorph for a mage, Nightfall for a Warlock, Cyclone for a Druid. This probably isn't making much sense, so let me get to the screenshots, so you can see what I mean.

Bear in mind that these were taken from my Shaman Resto - so the abilities you see on the timer bars here are not necessarily the same ones you would see on your class. However, we will come to that in a bit. As usual, please click any of the links for a full size image.

Timer Bars
So, this picture  is of the natty timer bars in action, so to speak. It's worth noting at this point that any bar created that is for a skill with charges will also show the number of charges remaining for example, in this image you can see that I have 3 Charges on my Water Shield remaining.

You'll notice a 'Forethought Talisman' timer bar on my own timers too - this is a Custom bar, but we'll come to that later in the feature. Here's an example  of how the timer bars appear on your targets.

Config
To get to the configuration screen, simply type '/classtimer' into your textbox. You'll get this screen  come up. Now, you'll notice there is a box on the top of the config screen, named 'Lock'. In this screenshot, the bars are locked, but if you untick the box, you can move them around to wherever you like. I have the following bars enabled: Player bar - this is obviously timer bars for yourself, Target bar - timers for your target, and Focus bar - timers for my current focus.

You'll also see in the screenshot that you can select whether or not to show your Class skills, one by one. Clicking across all the tabs will show you all your Class skills, and you won't see skills that aren't available to your class.

General Bar Settings
In this screenshot , you'll see the General Bar Settings. I'm only going to show you the option for the Player bar - but the other bars have exactly the same settings/options associated with them. So, ticking enable buffs/debuffs does exactly that. With just enable buffs ticked, you won't see any debuffs on your timer bars.

The 'Grow Up' tickbox will make your bars grow upwards - example  In the previous image, the bottom bar is where my timerbars are positioned, and 'growing up' ensures that subsequent timer bars that spawn will be above the first bar. Without 'Grow Up' ticked, they would spawn downwards, if that makes any sense 

Use Clicks, Show Only Icons, and Reversed will all do exactly as they say - purely aesthetic changes, although if you like keeping clutter on your UI to a minimum, you could have only the icons and time left showing, saving a fair amount of space.

Frame Attributes - I don't think this screenshot  needs any explanation - simple attributes for the 'look' of your timer bars. Width, Height, Scale, Spacing.

Texts - This option screen  is where you can change the font, and size of the text on the actual bars.

Textures - These are the options for 'prettyfying' your timer bars  The texture itself is 'Hal S' - from Hals UI 

Custom Timers
So finally, we can get on to the topic of Custom Timers  Now, I like to see the amount of time I have on every single proc that I get from items or enchants. Thankfully, ClassTimer allows you to add as many as you like. All you need to do is click the Timers menu option, then click on the Extras tab, and type the spell name into the box, then click Okay the Okay button will not appear until you have actually typed something in the textbox.

However, it does have to be the exact spell name, or the buff/debuff gained/lost when the item or enchant procs. As you can see, I added Forethought Talisman Trinket proc. You can add as many of these as you like - for example, my Warrior alt has a Sword that has a chance to cast a small Fireball at the target, and put a dot on. I added the spell name exactly as it appeared on the mob as a debuff - and now ClassTimer tracks that too.

All in all, this addon is very nice - although it may not be to everyones taste
