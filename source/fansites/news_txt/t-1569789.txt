Warlords of Draenor - The Everbloom

Warlords of Draenor - Dwarf Male Faces
The latest beta build also added some more variation to Dwarf Male faces. It appears we got a snapshot of work in progress, as the faces in this build are somewhere between the old and new faces from the Artcraft example http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/august/facesInProgress.jpg.

Right now resolve seems to be a lot weaker than vengeance in terms of healing, is that cause of the gear or is it intentional?
Intentional. Tanks were way too self-sustainable in Mists. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495006799884341248

Ok cool, I'm a fan of changes. On another note, will we see icon update to old abilities? Some seem outdated compared to new one
Unlikely. Changing icons on people can be really jarring. Example: The icon for Presence of Mind mage spell to make your next... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496002090087370752
...spell instant cast has been an icon of a plate helmet, since launch. That makes *no* sense whatesoever. We tried changing it... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496002248447496192
...to this in Mists beta, and everyone was furious, despite being objectively more sensical. http://t.co/SBX5wWmkx2 Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496002693580611584

Breath of Sindragosa should not have a 1min cd. It should be like Conversion toggled on/off as desired for RP dump. #WoD
Do you want to lose the pooling gameplay that it creates? Is that just too much complication? It's supposed to be complicated one Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494994192221757440
And does that not just devolve it into being your sole RP dump? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494994436175044608
i guess it could be considered a 'big CD', but the dmg output needs to be much higher.
Dmg output is intended that it's a single target gain. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495006384031662082

"Dual-Wielders favor blasting their foes with frost damage". Does this mean that DW is gonna use HB outside Rime too?
Absolutely. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495343986060443648

I thought Rune of Cinderglacier was going to be the new thing in WoD. Why was it removed? Just sticking to boring RFC again?
Yeah, we tried it out and found that it wasn't compelling at all, just added complication. FC did what we wanted it to do. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495384117937065984

With cinderglacier out of the picture, is the intent still for frost to use different runeforges? Ie 2x razorice vs FC+RI
FC+RI. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495616772100194304

Wouldn't you agree that it'd be better to put Obliterate on Frost's Mastery instead of buffing it's damage outright?
No, that would not achieve the intended rotations. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495643695623184386
I just want to make sure I got this right. So as 2H we want to stall KM to use it on Obliterate? Make us care about KM again?
Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495649919899025408

Just wondering, is Sunfall and Insect swarm still coming for moonkins or are the current abilities set in stone?
Sunfall is available via a glyph. Insect Swarm is not coming. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495011480681447424

Does Astral Communion work with haste? Cast time gets lower and the bar moves quicker? Or is it considered a channel spell?
It does get shorted with haste consistent with all channels, but that doesn't matter since it's spammable. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495741357973983232

Have you thought about let Hunter pet Birds fly while the Huinter is flying liek flyable companions can already?
This would involve some tech work, not likely for WoD launch but it's on my wishlist. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/495242452073472000

how will the SV rotation work? Will we want to pool focus above a certain number? Is there still an ICD on lock and load?
No ICD on LnL. You may want to pool in order to burst. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495384308563984385

Quick MM question. Any chance Sniper Training will have a quicker activation while the ticking buff is active?
Nope. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495633723451125760

multistrike doesn't proc of icicle intended or bug?
That's not true. Multistrikes can Icicle, but Icicles cannot Multistrike. It fully benefits once, but doesn't get to double-dip. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494994864975527939

Will Mirror Image snapshot the mage's SP in WoD or change dynamically over duration?
Dynamic. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495987419313741825

Any plans to make seal swapping feel less punishing forsaking a gcd for each buff? Making a swap generate 1HP maybe?
The talent is meant to be more difficult to use but offer added benefits. It's a talent built around seal-swapping. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495334094629109760

But you are fine with Paladin Seal dancing?
For a talent that specifically does that, and just that? Yes. Or for AoE vs single target? Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495625459338465280

With the recent change to tremor, could we see an increase to totem health made baseline to offset? Even a critter could kill em
That's what the glyph is for. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495622894622240768

Why did you make Flame Shock spreads only do base damage? Defeats the purpose of Fusion talent and Unleash Flame snapshoting.
It definitely does not defeat the purpose of either of those things. It's a limit on their power. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495633079969394689

Any Sudden Death tweaks inc? Eg: double proc chance but executes only deal half the damage of a regular execute?
Executes from Sudden Death won't use additional rage. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495703041819959297

Art
How are things looking for the quivers etc that were in the customization artcraft?
awesome, we've built some of the models. No eta for seeing them in-game but we'll probably update in Artcraft periodically artofcgrobinson https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/495772918677504000

Character / Items
i find it awkward after leveling to 100 that im still wearing legendary cloak and a few pieces of raid gear from SoO
The alternative is "I replaced my hard-earned legendary with a quest green, thanks Bliz." Dungeon gear should beat all of that. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/495046610649243648

Do tier pieces change from spec to spec with repecs including set bonuses similar to other head/shoulders/chest/gloves/legs?
Set bonuses change between specs. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495300902656282624

PvE
Since heroic and mythic don't share lockout, does this mean you can do mythic same week as heroic highmaul becomes available?
Mythic will be locked for an additional week, so you cannot. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/495045585502617600

I didn't care for that design, personally, but oh, well.
Curious - what about it? Worth noting that in retrospect we feel HoF came too soon; most weren't done with MSV. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/495282692968046592
wouldn't a simple attunementIE kill end boss to enter the next raid instance solve these issues?
But also psychology of "aaaaa I'm behind, there's another raid? I'm not even done with the last one!" WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/495326391420723200

Curious, Why aren't you planning to give us the old raid soloable buff for MoP raids/dungeons? Wont they be impossible at 100?
No, your damage and damage reduction are much stronger against significantly lower level opponents in Warlords. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495631341619122176

PvP
Are there still new BG's planned for warlords? We haven't heard anything about them since Blizzcon.
For expansion release, our efforts are focused on Ashran. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495049110873849859

IIRC there was talk about making new "War" category for BGs with Wingergrasp, AV, etc. or new BGs like them. Still on table?
We like the idea but not a high priority right now. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495225191346479104

Will unobtainable Wotlk pvp gear be available for transmog in WoD?
.All previous seasons should be available on beta. If you find something is missing, let us know. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495225588542894080
which vendors would I find them at? And does that include the old weapons too?
Includes weapons. Should be Netherstorm/Tanaris right ? holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495227097414385664

Vehicles yes. But why not destructible buildings using dynamite, etc? Destroy a bridge, force a change of assault approach e.g.
We didn't want Ashran to be about siege and fortress warfare. We wanted it to be about exploration and world pvp. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495332145460547584

have you guys ever considered allowing players to transfer CP to alts? i have 22.6k on my main, and my alt has a 22k cap
No, we greatly dislike the idea of simply transferring Honor/Conquest from one character to another. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495333604965101569

Why is rated arena being disabled for twinks?I know we are the minority,but how does taking rated from us benefit lvl100s
Without a good sized population the rating system is easily exploited. It was never intended for low levels. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495224813561331712
Getting rid of arenas for levels under 100 = Lots of twinks will quit wow = less people paying for wow = dead game
Low level players can still do arenas using skirmishes, but they will not receive a rating or achievements. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495392783419453440
But low levels do it for the ratings so they can boast about it Why not give us rating but no chievements?
At that population level, ratings are easily exploited and pretty much meaningless. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495393335796715522
It means something to the people that like to brag about rating 
They can do it at max level. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495394585175003137
Well you've just made a lot of twinkers angry, lots of them are quitting so rip subscribers in WoD.
Definitely willing to hear complaints, but unsub threats are not effective feedback. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495397225535528960
We're still providing the ability to do arenas, but a rating system at that level with so few people is broken holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495397469899870208

If my friend and I build different buildings at our outposts in each zone, can we still quest together
Yes, it will only cause minor changes in most zones 1 quest line maybe. Gorgrond is an exception. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/495334733451374592
However, in Gorgrond, you'll get bonus objectives in the areas for which you don't have quests. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/495334899055067136
