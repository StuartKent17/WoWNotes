Activision Blizzard latest earning call revealed that World of Warcraft lost another 300,000 subscribers last quarter, following the loss of 600k subscribers announced last quarter (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/901731-WoW-Loses-600k-Subscribers-Diablo-3-Beta-Q3-2011-Arena-Passe-Blue-Posts).<br>
<br>
In this conference call we also learned that: <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The next patch will include &quot;major raid and dungeon content&quot;, we can most likely expect a raid and a 5-man from Patch 4.3<br>
Patch 4.3 will be the &quot;largest content update since Cataclysm&quot;<br>
It will be released later this year, which means that we can probably expect a PTR soon. <br>
<br>
<br>
It&apos;s also worth noting that despite the loss of players, Mike Morhaime pointed out that the new trial system resulted in an increase in new account creations.

Thanks to the overwhelming generosity of World of Warcraft players around the world who purchased the Cenarion Hatchling (http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=1100001530) pet, we&#x2019;ve raised a total of more than $1.9 million USD to support the ongoing earthquake and tsunami relief efforts in Japan. In May, we announced (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2717672) that for every Cenarion Hatchling purchased by July 31, 2011, 100% of the $10 USD adoption fee would be going to assist victims of this disaster -- and the community responded by opening up their hearts and wallets wide. Thanks again for your support and for helping to make an impact on the lives of those affected by these events.<br>

Diablo III Beta Profile Update<br>
The beta test approaches! We&#x2019;ve just updated our System Check program and would like everyone to update their Battle.net Beta Profile information by running the new one. You should do this regardless of whether there have been hardware changes made to your system.<br>
<br>
You can run the new System Check by visiting the Beta Profile settings of your Battle.net account:<br>
<br>
https://www.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html<br>
<br>
I don&#x2019;t have a Beta Profile<br>
If you haven&#x2019;t yet created a Beta Profile on your Battle.net account you&#x2019;ll be presented with two download options, PC and Mac, for our System Check program. Running the program will present you with the Beta Test Opt-In Agreement, and once you agree to that it will immediately query basic computer specification information such as your type of video card, processor, and RAM. Clicking the Send button will then upload the shown information to your account.<br>
<br>
On your Beta Profile page, you&#x2019;ll want to ensure you at least have &#x201C;Diablo Universe&#x201D; checked for future testing, if not StarCraft and Warcraft as well. That&#x2019;s it! You&#x2019;re now eligible for future beta test opportunities.<br>
<br>
I have a Beta Profile<br>
If you&#x2019;ve previously uploaded your system info you should use the links to download the new System Check program for PC or Mac and update your system info. Run the program, read through the Beta Test Opt-In Agreement that appears, and once you agree to that the program will immediately query your basic computer specification information. Click Send and the program will automatically update your profile with your system specifications. You&#x2019;ll remain opted in for whichever beta tests you&#x2019;ve previously selected, and you can change these selections on your Beta Profile page at any time.<br>
<br>
Having current system specifications and checking the franchise boxes to express interest in beta testing our future products does not guarantee your entry into the beta test. We will grant a very limited number of people entry from the entire pool of those interested, based on their system specifications and other factors. While having an official Battle.net Beta Profile is one way to potentially get in, we&#x2019;ll have information on other ways to increase your chances as we draw closer to the beta test. <br>

Repair costs too expensive?<br>
Repair costs have always scaled with item level. If anything, I&apos;d say this game has a burden of too much gold out in the economy, rather than too little. 4 deaths in 1 5-player Heroic dungeon run is well above what you should expect as an average, and 100 gold is pretty easy to come by at level 85.
