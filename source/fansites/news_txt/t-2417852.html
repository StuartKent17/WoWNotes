&quot;Old Soldier&quot; Release Timing<br>
...as a result of the very emotional reactions from horde players over the past few days? Can&apos;t say for sure, but releasing it in the middle of the night seems suspicious...<br>
We had planned for it to be debuted at Chinajoy months ago (hence why it was late at night in the US), long before you guys ever knew Warbringers were even a thing.

Zappiboi<br>
Did you all write the script after Zappyboi became a beloved meme? Or was this just a hilariously awesome coincidence?<br>
I think they&apos;ve said they do things like a year or two in advance for the expansions, so I think it&apos;s just a glorious coincidence.<br>
<br>
Who knows, though. Their cinematics department could be getting so good at this, they don&apos;t need a ton of time anymore to put these together allowing them to capitalize on audience reaction. /shrug<br>
<br>
Either way, this cinematic was amazing. I hope this puts a lot of horde players&apos; minds at ease after the Sylvanas video. Blizzard has more in store for us.[/i]<br>
So for a serious answer, no. I don&apos;t think anyone expected the Zappi Boi thing. In fact when we told people that Zappi Boi posts were the new hotness right after the announcement they were a little confused, &quot;Zappi what?, really?, alright then why not?&quot; I believe was the first response. Nobody expected him to be named that&apos;s for sure. <br>
<br>
This game has had so many weird memed things before we even used &quot;meme&quot; as a word in this way, so nobody didn&apos;t not get it at least. As for the timeline, yes the Saurfang cinematic was being created before you guys ever saw the Battle for Lordaeron cinematic, so we truly had no way to predict it. Just luck? If you want to call it that.
