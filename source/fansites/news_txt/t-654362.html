Today, Exodus (http://www.exo-guild.com/) (US-Ysondre) finally took down the last undefeated hard mode of Ulduar : Alone in the Darkness (25 player) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3164/alone-in-the-darkness-25-player/)! Congratulations to them. <br>
<br>
As we suspected, the extra loot you get for beating Yogg-Saron in the hardest mode is nothing less than Mimiron&apos;s Head (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/45693/). <br>
