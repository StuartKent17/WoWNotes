Anyone attending Blizzcon in person or with the Virtual ticket (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/virtual-ticket/) will get some in-game goodies: WoW players get a Crusader Murloc, D3 players get a nice banner, SC2 players get a Portrait and Decal, and Hearthstone players will get a special commemorative card. Blizzcon is a little bit over a month away, taking place on November 8th and 9th!<br>
