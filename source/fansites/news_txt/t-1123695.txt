Boubouille2012-04-28, 08:10 AMMists Of Pandaria Beta - Build 15640 Mounts
The latest beta patches added a couple of interesting mounts to the game, and I know you guys like mounts! Time for a mini-preview. 


The Reins of the Grand Expedition Yak http://www.wowdb.com/items/84101 will most likely be a fairly expensive mount. The current sell price to NPC is 15 000 Gold, that makes the buying price much higher. The mount is HUGE and will apparently come with two vendors like the WotLK mammoth. 
The Reins of the Crimson Riding Crane http://www.wowdb.com/items/84728 and Reins of the Amber Scorpion http://www.wowdb.com/items/85262 are from unknown sources.

Dragon Soul Difficulty Change
At the completion of scheduled server maintenance during the week of April 30, the “Power of the Aspects” spell will grow more powerful, reducing the health and damage dealt of all enemies in the Dragon Soul raid by 20%. This spell will grow progressively stronger over time to reduce the difficulty and make the encounters more accessible. The spell will affect both normal and Heroic difficulties, but it will not affect the Raid Finder difficulty.

Don’t need the help of the Dragon Aspects? The spell can be disabled by talking to Lord Afrasastrasz at the beginning of Dragon Soul.

We hope you continue to enjoy Dragon Soul, and that these changes encourage you to attempt a higher difficulty, or just keep pushing to down that next boss.


Annual Pass Beta Invite Update
We want to confirm that, at this time, all World of Warcraft Annual Pass subscribers have been invited to the Mists of Pandaria beta test, with two groups of exceptions. One exception group are those who purchased an Annual Pass on or after April 18, and will receive their invite in a future wave. The second exception is a small list of remaining accounts from previous waves that encountered an error, and will be properly flagged for beta access as soon as we can resolve the issue.

If you haven't yet purchased an Annual Pass, you still have time to guarantee your spot in the beta by signing up for a year agreement link before the offer expires on April 30. Those taking advantage of the Annual Pass receive Diablo III for free, access to the Mists of Pandaria beta, and the exclusive Tyrael's Charger flying mount for your World of Warcraft characters. 


Blue Posts
Account-Wide Achievements
Our intent is that most achievement rewards mounts etc. should be at the account level. I can't promise that because it's not in and working yet, but that's the intent.

There are probably going to be enough account-level achievement questions that we should put a blog together to explain it all. We'll see if we can find time to do that. 

The word 'most' seems prevalent in any discussion involving the account-wide achievements. Is there a specific sort of achievement that should be character-only?
We aren't planning for now to have any character only achievements, but there will probably be some account only achievements. These would be things like level a Horde and Alliance character to 90, which wouldn't make sense for one character. Technically, an account-only achievement is different from account-wide, hence the "most." Maybe it's too technical a point to bother with though.

Ranged Weapons in MoP
There are two issues here getting muddled together:

Ranged weapons will have the stat budgets of two-handed weapons. You can treat them as two-handed weapons in most respects. That work hasn't been done yet.

Ranged weapons are not going to be compensated for the loss of stats from no longer having a melee weapon equipped simultaneously. This is because all ranged-weapon slot type things have gone away, so everyone is affected evenly. However, we also want your damage when you log in for the first time to be about the same as it is now, so overall your damage will be compensated in a sense.
