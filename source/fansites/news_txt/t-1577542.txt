Warlords of Draenor - Developer Interviews
MamyTwink http://www.mamytwink.com/actualite/interview-gamescom-2014-tom-chilton-repond-a-nos-questions had the opportunity to talk to Tom Chilton at Gamescom and we have summarized the more important parts of the interview below.

Warlords Content

There is a level 100 content area in every zone. It is similar to Timeless Isle, but also includes "chapter quests" that provide an ongoing story over several weeks. 
Reputations in Warlords won't reward as many epic items as before, but you can still earn reputation with various factions for some rewards. It won't be anything like the Mists of Pandaria reputation grinds. 
The Iron Horde will be the main enemy throughout the expansion, but they change somewhat throughout the expansion. 
There will be an increased Legion presence by the end of the expansion. 


Future Plans

Tanaan Jungle will be in a content patch. It contains the Grommash Hellscream raid, as well as some outdoor world content. 
At some point the team would like to add new character customization options, but right now they are working on making the new models similar to the old ones as closely as possible.
Cosmetic class items are still on track, but won't be released with Warlords launch. They will most likely be released a few at a time throughout the expansion and beyond.


Timelines

The alternative timeline is mostly being used to allow players to experience a setting they wouldn't normally be able to see in WoW. 
At some point in the future in another expansion they could explore the Ogre continent from Draenor. 
We won't see an alternative timeline version of Azeroth.



Warlords of Draenor - Drake Collector Achievement
Jonathan LeCraft shared https://twitter.com/TheCrafticus/status/501930988692180994 another upcoming achievement recently, along with the reward: the Emerald Drake. He also noted that soloing Deathwing for the Blazing Drake http://beta.wowdb.com/items/77067-reins-of-the-blazing-drake will be possible. Several of these mounts are fairly rare drops, with some as low as a 1% drop rate.

Upcoming Beta Build
Greetings All!

The Beta realms will be coming down for maintenance tomorrow morning Thursday, 8/21 in order to deploy a new build. I'll be updating this thread with information and time estimates as I receive them. We hope to finish realm maintenance on all realms before our "Play with the Blues" event at 3:00 pm PDT except for the Level 100 PvE Beta Realm which will stay down a bit longer,

Starting this thread pretty early to give you folks a heads up

I'll be leaving this thread open for general discussion as long as people remain civil and follow forum rules.


Upcoming Tech Blog
Players with beta access may have noticed that the old MSAA http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisample_anti-aliasing option is now gone. In its place is FXAA http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_approximate_anti-aliasing and CMAA https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/conservative-morphological-anti-aliasing-cmaa-update options. These offer reduced jaggniess at less of a performance cost than MSAA, but tend to result in somewhat blurrier images. From the tweets so far, it seems like this may have been a necessary change

Play With the Blues - Thursday Aug 21
It’s time to play with Blues on the Beta realms! Help us put the Premade Groups feature through its paces by creating and joining lots of Dungeon and 3v3 Arena groups. During the playtest, you’ll have a chance to encounter members of the Warcraft Development Team like Watcher, Celestalon, and Holinka, in addition to QA, CS, and CM team members as we join you for a Dungeon run or Arena match.

What: Create Premade Groups, run Dungeons, and 3v3 Arena groups with Blizzard employees!
When: Thursday, August 21, 2014 from 03:00 PM to 05:00 PM PDT.
Where: Level 100 PvE and Level 100 PvP Beta realms
How you’ll know they’re a Blue: Blizzard employees will be in a guild called Blizzard Alliance or Blizzard Horde respectively for the duration of the event.

How to create a Premade Group:

For Dungeons, access the Group Finder pane bound to I key by default. Select Premade Groups --> Dungeons --> Find a Group or Start a GroupOr
For Arenas, access the Player vs. Player pane bound to H key by default. Select Premade Groups --> Arenas --> Find a Group or Start a Group 3v3 


If you want to learn more about improvements to Group Finder in Warlords of Draenor; check out Premade Groups: Looking for Adventure http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/15200760.

For information on how to create a level-100 template character, submitting a bug report, or suggestion; check out Welcome to the Beta Test: PLEASE READ http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13019672288!

Good, wholesome fun for the whole family! We look forward to grouping with you.

Feedback on Premade Groups – We'll create a thread to collect feedback on the Premade Group tool. 



Blue Tweets
Racials
Why keep racials? Why not just give us a pool of racials to choose from so we can play the race we want over obligatory min/max?
Because at its heart, WoW is a fantasy roleplaying game. Min/Maxing becomes a lot less "obligatory" with trivial differences. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499659833679695873

Classes
Question: Since absorbs cause problems for healers Disc priests, why not change absorbs to % incoming damage reduction?
That's an extremely different thing, would be cause way more problems. Regardless, absorbs don't cause problems like that in WoD Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499062978772074496
It's just not the snipe-heavy world where absorbs were king, anymore. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499063064361066496

What is the design goal of glyphs in WoD? Seeing a lot of glyphs with small dps benefits.
Small *situational* DPS gains are fine. Sometimes that situation may be rather broad, such as "When there's cleave" though. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499201741921857537

Celestalon, do you understand what RNG stands for? It stands for RANDOM, when is RANDOM reliable? What drugs are you on?
When it's extremely common and there are tons of chances. That's when. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499376563104661504

We have no current plans to bring back 2H Enhancement. Sorry. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499259160777601024
But why did you change requirements for Stormstrike? We have been able to cast it with 2-hand at least 6 years, why it over?

Really, what is the point of forced CD from Defensive Stance? Can we get just a bit of feedback?
The point is so that defensive abilities Devastate/Revenge don't become filler abilities during empty GCDs while DPSing. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499019095115714560
If just you make Dev/Rev do shit damage but really high threat nobody would bother swapping stances to use them for DPS. Win-Win
That's not true. "shit" damage is better than zero damage. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499020664758493185

well D stance is now uselss... so what is a DK's down side to Blood prez?
A big DPS loss and in the case of Unholy movement speed. The other presences do have benefits. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499025437561860097
since Dks existed sitting in blood prez doesn't really effect them as much as you think.
It's a DPS loss and a movement speed loss. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499026366528897026
and frost dks don't lose much either... Not trying to be rude but have you actually pvped in the 2k+ bracket?
Do you even 2k bro? holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499028083710504960
lol a dev with some humor, the sad part is I'm being serious... Dk can sit in BP and still pit out offensive pressure
they can still put out pressure, but it's less pressure. Arguably this is even more the case for Frost. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499028640454041600

Character / Items
Will there be any time soon more vanity xmog ítems such as Jewel of the Firelord and friends? That'd be cool
Some, but we're a bit concerned about overloading bagspace before a better system is implemented Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/499313206360154113

Warlords of Draenor Stats
Do u mean they're back to just agi/str/int increases again?
Flasks are back to primary stats. All of the others are still secondary stats. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/498996928353271809

If its that easy, then askmrrobot will change from "enchant/gem/forge this to that" to "eat/enchant/gem" Still same
Perhaps... Except the directions will amount to "Get Haste" instead of two dozen specific reforge/gem lines. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499010607601815552

How? I'm not saying removing reforging is good/bad, I just want to know how you can stack a specific stat MORE w/o.
Two cases to consider: Typical, and Ideal.Typical: 40% of secondaries in BestStat, 25% / 15% / 15% / 5% in other secondaries. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499008665454518272
In Mists, you'd reforge that to 44% / 35% / 9% / 9% / 3%.In Warlords, you'd enchant/food/gem to 50% / 21% / 13% / 13% / 4%. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499008744605241344
And Ideal is super simple. In that case, every item has your best stat, so reforging did nothing. Enchants are pure upgrade. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499008821679763456
what if i want a stat than is not my attunemented stat? lets say... mastery for a resto druid?
Then great, stack that. This doesn't limit that in any way. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499011511541452800

Versatility can you honestly say this it plays a part? You will never prio it with its bad ratio, reign that in pls instead.
I don't understand what you're asking, but yes, Versatility will be valuable. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499001116260958208
How will it be valuable? Would prioritize it or do you force us to. Wont beat your attuned stats nor will it be with #2 stat
It will be valuable where its hybridity is useful, especially the damage reduction. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499009127608098817
So a secondary stat built around situational hybridity? I'm sorry this stat needs rethinking, This will never stick in mythic.
Actually, I suspect that there are many cases where Mythic guilds will sacrifice 2% damage for 5% *passive* damage reduction. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499013536031334401

you said several hundred from gems. while that could be as low as 2 gems, it implies several, or "tons" of gems
I'm not giving out exact chances of sockets, but 2+ on your character will not be unusual. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499015236293115904

Can we just have 1 Flask which changes with your spec similar to gear? Choosing between int/agi as a MW is going to be hard.
If secondary stat flasks were "too strong" why not nerf them rather than removing them? Less choice = bad, surely?
It's all part of a combined package, not just individual parts. Enchants Armor and Weapon, Food, and Gems, still remain. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499012149910315008
You can understand frustration right? Being able to switch flasks depending on encounter was fun/engaging. Int/stam/agi/str isnt
Sure, I can understand the immediate reaction; it'll be OK once people get a better view of the full picture trying to help! Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499013311824818176
The nerfs to enchants to reduce secondary stat stacking? 30% crit buffed as a MW pre-t17 hc gear felt a little insane!
Yep. See my other recent tweets. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499015381181136896

do you think it will be possible to hit haste or crit caps in the final tier of WoD?
Haste has a relatively low *soft* cap. With procs, that'll be hittable. We don't see a way around that. Crit, not likely. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499016562880172033

You're adding gem sockets back to most gear and not just warforged?
Gems and Warforged are separate. Both can be on all Warlords gear. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499011315352883200
Aren't they also supposed to be limited by rng? Saying you can stack tons of gems is misleading.
They are RNG-tied. But I definitely did not say you could stack tons of gems. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499012543176650752
You can't really say gems for customizing if its pure rng if you can use them are not.
Just because something is random doesn't mean that they can't be expected to be used. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499019765621342208

"Several Hundred From Gems" YOUR EXACT WORDS. That means you EXPECT us to try and stack gems.
I'm guessing that you're significantly misunderstanding something. That's a mere 2 sockets, which is quite common. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499359185696329728
A "Mere" 2 sockets that are still RNG based. Try spending weeks on a 16% drop rate and getting NOTHING. Zero Control.
There's this misconception that anything RNG involved is bad or unreliable. That's wrong. This is not rare. Relax. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499364657421754368
DST would like to say hi. Warglaives during progression are hosting a "Reliable RNG drop party" for you 3
Yeah... You're misunderstanding. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499381510584016896
What am I understanding? That RNG is still RNG and it will never be reliable? That's kind of what RNG is, it's a dice roll.
You're looking at this from the point of view of "this guy's an idiot lol". Try looking at it from "What am I misunderstanding?" Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499383129346297856
Here's an example: Do you wear any dropped gear? All dropped gear is random, but you don't say that "zomg it's RNG USELESS", right? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499383340001017856
Sure, some specific pieces may be quite rare, and RNG can make it unreliable to get specific pieces. But that doesn't happen to... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499383624429355009
...every slot. Sockets can appear on all gear. That's huge, and makes it reliable that you'll get some. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499384024586928128
Now do you see why RNG will never be reliable? If RNG would be reliable casinos would go out business.
No. Really, no. That's not how probability or statistics works. And casinos work because they average <100% payout. They take a cut. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499387635731685376

PvE
Curious on how unlocking Mythic will work in Highmaul with 3 optional. 7/7 Heroic killed or just an Imperator kill necessary?
No achievement requirement to enter Mythic. You could always bypass it by getting someone to start your raid, anyway. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/499042431426248705

PvP
is a 200 conquest Ashran bonus number the most you can earn a week in Ashran? 
it's 200 extra conquest you can only get in Ashran. You can get more than 200 in Ashran though. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499040299264786432
Does that mean that ashran is considered 'mandatory' pvping? If you don't do ashran every week you fall behind someone who is?
Only if someone is being unreasonable. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499041796878770176
Heh, you don't understand the psychology of your player base much do you?
The broader playerbase or the very engaged ones on twitter and the forums? holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499055055538909185

Can you expand more on the conquest rewards from Ashran? As a person who does not enjoy arena, loved hearing conq earned in ashran
The current plan is to reward conquest for conquering the enemy base or winning one of the dynamic events in the outer areas. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499391784321966080

Is there a limit in the inflation/MMR system or will we really end up 3300+ rating?
There is a limit but I don't think we'll get there. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499009557884973057
Slight tangent: Why doesn't WoW arena use a SC3 style bracket system? Would love Josh Menke's insights on this.
I've had a lot of conversations about the SC and WoW brackets with Josh and David Kim. Both systems have pros/cons. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499054891461926912
Being constantly reminded your Bronze/Silver isn't always fun but at least you have milestones. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499055807174963200
But we talk a lot about blue sky ideas for a better progression and rewards system. Such a big change would need to be home run. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499056144191463425

got a question for ya. In WoD, can you obtain strong boxes just for queuing specifically for a BG?
No, only for random battlegrounds. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499323567964557313
what will the reward be for winning a specific que then? Will honor still be given?
Same as before, honor in the battleground. Strong boxes replaced the 270/135 honor you would get. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499432207367172097
