Trading Card Mounts no longer Bind on Pickup in 3.2?
Let me start this news with a small disclaimer, this information is absolutely NOT confirmed by Blizzard for the moment and I will not be responsible if you decide to do stupid things after reading it. 

While I was checking a few things on PTRs, a very interesting change showed up on my screen : the Spectral Tiger mount wasn't bound on pickup anymore. I decided to investigate a little more and realized that most of the TCG mounts had their bind removed. Except for the turtle

I didn't want to news it earlier because it could have been a bug but apparently, the interface to redeem TCG codes was slightly changed and the Spectral Tiger mounts seem to have different codes for the normal and the swift version.

Hopefully we'll hear from Blizzard about this very soon.
