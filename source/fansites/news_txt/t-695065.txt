Professor Putricide Heroic World First Kill by Paragon
Paragon  just defeated Professor Putricide in heroic mode and gets another world first kill in Icecrown Citadel. They killed all the end-wing bosses and the lich king is next on the list  Congratulations to them.


 

However, killing the Lich King in heroic mode might be harder than it looks. According to the russian guild Экзорсус  EU-Ревущий фьорд the Lich King heroic mode has been buffed in 10-man instances and his health was buffed from 22.5M to 29.5M, making the fight look a lot harder now. It wouldn't be surprising if the buff also affected the 25-man version of the encounter.
