Professor Putricide Heroic World First Kill by Paragon
Paragon http://www.paragon-wow.com/ just defeated Professor Putricide in heroic mode and gets another world first kill in Icecrown Citadel. They killed all the end-wing bosses and the lich king is next on the list http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/lich_king_next.jpg. Congratulations to them.

However, killing the Lich King in heroic mode might be harder than it looks. According to the russian guild Экзорсус http://exorsus.ru/ EU-Ревущий фьорд the Lich King heroic mode has been buffed in 10-man instances and his health was buffed from 22.5M to 29.5M, making the fight look a lot harder now. It wouldn't be surprising if the buff also affected the 25-man version of the encounter.
