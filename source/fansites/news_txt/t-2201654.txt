A world quest involving the vendor Treasure Master Iks'reeged  is sometimes available, allowing you to turn in 100 x Nethershard  for a Wyrmtongue's Cache Key  You can also purchase keys for 2000 x Nethershard

Patch 7.2 Hotfixes - April 12
Artifacts

The requirement "Complete 100 dungeons while using your Hidden Artifact appearance" to unlock Hidden Artifact appearance color variant 2 has been reduced from 100 to 30 dungeon completions.

Developers’ notes: The time and effort required for this Hidden Artifact unlock wasn’t consistent with the other two color unlocks. Additionally, now that Challenge Artifact appearances are in the game, requiring you to continue using your Hidden Artifact appearance which can't be transmogged into the more prestigious Challenge appearance for 100 dungeons was too much.



Bonus Event

Corrected an issue preventing some players from accepting The Arena Calls skirmish event quest.


Classes

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Wrathguard's Mortal Cleave should now hit the same arc as the Felguard's Legion Strike ability.
The Observer's Optical Blast should now share a cooldown with other Silence effects.
Flames of Sargeras Artifact Trait increases the damage of both Conflagrate and Shadowburn.



Items

Kil'jaeden's Burning Wish  now deals damage when equipped by level 101-109 characters.


Tailoring

Melandrus' Star-Touched Bracers  now drop in Heroic difficulty during "The Thread of Starlight".

PTR Development Notes - Build 23910
Just to clarify: the specs I called out in the original post are those we're planning major rotational/mechanical changes to. We're also planning talent/balance tuning for many other specs e.g. Fire Mage, Blood DK, others that don't need a mechanical overhaul but could still use some numbers love. Official Forums

Blackout Strikes
That datamining is extremely incomplete. It's a 500pc jigsaw puzzle with 300 of the pieces missing. Best to wait for the actual PTR. You won't have to wait 14sec between Blackout Strikes. Official Forums

On the day of a major patch, I expect ____ hours of quest content to unlock immediately. It should include at least: <Add your opinions>. Muffinus 
Opening day was fine. Pacing of story events after is what feels eh. Story seems stuck since camp was set… 
What would be a solid story for you to chew through in a week? Muffinus 

I would have liked BrS much more if it felt engaging. It's just an unfun twice-a-daily hub cuz of staggered WQ timers with little reward.
What's engaging? Genuinely curious :] Muffinus 

I expected more than we got in 7.2.. I think there needed to be more on the broken shore itself and less going back to the other zones
What would have been a satisfying day 1 for you? Paint me a picture of what that finale cinematic looks like. Muffinus 

The slow drip of content is unacceptable. 11 weeks?! I seriously have not played since Monday. If I want to binge-play, let me binge-play!
How far would you want to be able to binge to? The end? How long would that take? Muffinus 

If we are being honest with each other, I'm not like others. I miss dailies. I enjoyed the MoP daily format. 
What do you miss about it? Muffinus 


Patch 7.2 - Riddler's Mind-Worm
We've added a video with the locations for the Riddler's Mind-Worm  mount to make finding the pages a little easier.
