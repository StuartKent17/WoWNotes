We&#x2019;re working on the following adjustments to raid encounters. These changes are not live yet, but will go live later this evening or tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Dungeons and Raids<br>
<br>
Battle of Dazar&#x2019;alor<br>
<br>
Grong, the Jungle Lord<br>
<br>
Death Empowerment (Alliance) and Apetagonize (Horde) cast time increased to 5 seconds on Mythic difficulty (was 4 seconds).<br>
Death Specters (Alliance) and Apetagonizers (Horde) health reduced by 20% on Mythic difficulty.<br>
<br>
High Tinker Mekkatorque<br>
<br>
Gigavolt Charge&#x2019;s radiation zone duration reduced to 2 minutes on Mythic difficulty (was 3 minutes).<br>
Tampering duration increased to 30 seconds on Mythic difficulty (was 25 seconds).<br>
<br>
Lady Jaina Proudmoore<br>
<br>
Jaina now kills all players instantly if the entire raid is frozen solid during an intermission phase.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; note: Previously, if an entire raid was frozen solid, all players would have to wait until they each died before they could restart the encounter. This change will help raids quickly reset and start the fight again.</div></div>
