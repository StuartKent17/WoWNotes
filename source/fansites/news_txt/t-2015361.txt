Warcraft Movie - Box Office Update
The Warcraft Movie has done fairly well internationally http://deadline.com/2016/06/finding-dory-warcraft-china-conjuring-me-before-you-x-men-apocalypse-international-box-office-weekend-results-1201775198/, with some claiming it has done too well in China http://chinafilminsider.com/china-box-office-warcraft-ticket-sales-come-scrutiny/:


China is now up to $205M.
The international total is $340M and worldwide total is $378.9M.
The movie was #1 in China for 12 days
There were claims of fraud on Chinese social media:

82 of the top 100 grossing cinemas on Saturday belong to Wanda, far above the usual 40 that usually are on the list.
One Chinese theater saw ticket sales increase 406% from Friday.
Another Chinese theater had a very high number of average moviegoers per screen for being in a city that is flooded. 
Dalian Wanda claims that numbers were high due to the promotion that brought more people to the malls and the numbers are correct. 



Blue Tweets
PvE
So just to make sure I'm reading this correctly - Arcway and Court of Stars are going to be Mythic-only from launch?
Yep. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/742908523332304896

Some players don't have the skills for Mythic dungeons.
Honestly if you have the skills for Heroic and 4 people to join you, Mythic is also for you. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/742912043301228544
Adding multiple levels of Mythic, only to make the first a brick wall, would defeat the purpose. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/742912464086405121

I mean WOD Mythic pre-mades gives me a bad taste for this.
Understandable - efficiency-minded folks running familiar content for a completion reward can make for an unfriendly crowd. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/742950243243806722

PvP
with conquest being removed as a currency will players still receive the Conquest to Gold conversion at the end of this season
Yes, you will still receive gold for conquest and honor at the end of this season. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/743223992090169344

Professions
you heavily suggested to players how they should have their professions set up. I agree, for mains. For alts, it's not so simple
Sorry it came across that way. Double-crafting is absolutely a viable path that offers some advantages. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/743571892716482560
Again, not to be rude, but just wanted to point out this is one of the many varied ways players choose to play. If you really
But even if 2x-crafting has advantages, you should still have a bit of gatherer-envy; if not, gathering is probably undervalued. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/743572159964995586


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Do you think storyline conclusions should be raid-exclusive in a situation where raiding is hard?
It never bothered me. Maybe the compromise should be some stories but not every story? OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/742400094914285568
The conclusion to the Arthas story e.g. is a big deal, years in the making, so should be for all? OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/742400303576711173
But also weird when an epic boss in a quest or dungeon feels weaker than a less well known raid boss. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/742400481939447808

Warcraft Twitch Badges
Twitch had an event that allowed you to show an Alliance or Horde badge in chat http://warcraftontwitch.tv/ around the time of the Warcraft movie release. We looked at the faction balance of these badges in chat on the Warcraft channel during the movie premiere and other top streamers during the week.

Most chats had around 30-50% of people that talked with no badge and they were excluded from these results.
