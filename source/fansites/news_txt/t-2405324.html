Beta Build Update - 6/19/2018<br>
Greetings all, <br>
<br>
Realms came down a bit ago to facilitate a new build update. No ETA for today&apos;s push but things should be coming up soon.<br>
<br>
Also, character copy will be enabled! Please note that under load, the character copy system could fail to create at times due to volume of requests. If things seem slow, take a deep breath, wait a bit and try again later.<br>
<br>
I&apos;ll leave this thread open for discussion as long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your patience everyone!<br>
