Earlier today MMO-Champion got flagged as &quot;unsafe&quot; by Google, resulting in a big ass (http://xkcd.com/37/) warning message every time you tried to access the site explaining that MMO-Champion will eat your soul. Well good news, MMO-Champion doesn&apos;t eat souls!<br>
<br>
This is what happened in a nutshell.<br>
<br>
In the morning an ad network got compromised and ended up serving a malware. (This is a pretty popular/high-end ad network and I&apos;m not sure if I can give away the name without getting my ass kicked. I&apos;ll let them do their own communication) <br>
We disabled ads as soon as the first warning appeared.<br>
MMO-Champion or any of our infrastructure wasn&apos;t compromised, this was entirely 3rd party. <br>
Since it&apos;s 3rd party and it&apos;s always better to be safe than sorry, take this as an opportunity to run a good old Malwarebytes Anti Malware (www.malwarebytes.org) scan on your computer. <br>
<br>
<br>
Obviously we apologize for the inconvenience.</div></div>
