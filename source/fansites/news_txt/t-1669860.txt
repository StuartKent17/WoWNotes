Happy New Year!
As we mark the end of 2014, it’s time to ring in 2015 all across Azeroth. Beginning today, December 31, the skies above all the major cities will be filled with glorious fireworks!


  

Every hour on the hour, look to the skies for a dazzling display of explosions as you're sipping brews and tasting delicious foodstuffs.

Join the festivities and say hello to the new year! One word of caution, though—if you’re planning to enjoy the fireworks in Booty Bay, word has it the guards there have been celebrating a bit too hard and aren’t likely to enforce the town rules.

So thank you, to the overwhelming majority that are genuinely good gracious people. Jerks are the exception so they often stand out. holinka
