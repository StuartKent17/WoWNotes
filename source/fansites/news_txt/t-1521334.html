An Artcraft blog went up on the french official website, Blizzard posted a couple of concepts of cosmetic-only accessories for some of the classes.<br>
<br>
<br>
These cosmetic items will probably make it into the game after the release of Warlords of Draenor. <br>
The concepts are for the moment Alliance-only but will be differentiated for each faction if Blizzard decides it&apos;s the best way to go. <br>
The could apply to every classes, for example Rogues could decide to equip cosmetic daggers or vials of poison. <br>
This is only a first concept and the dev team is still actively working on the idea. <br>

The full Artcraft doesn&apos;t give much more details on when these accessories will be available, and the official blog should be available on the official site shortly.</div></div>
