As people have noticed, a few changes on PTR, mainly intended to respond to concerns about the level 100 row:<br>
<br>
<br>
Frost Strike (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/49143-frost-strike) damage increased 15%<br>
Breath of Sindragosa (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/152279-breath-of-sindragosa) damage reduced 10%<br>
Icecap (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/207126-icecap) reduces Pillar of Frost (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/51271-pillar-of-frost) cooldown by 3 seconds (from 1 second)<br>
<br>
<br>
This is still a net buff to Breath in the patch, due to the addition of the 4 Runes. But the damage buff to Frost Strike primarily improves the other two talents. Icecap/Icy Citadel builds should also be a good bit more competitive.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Patch 8.2 PTR - Arms Warrior Changes<br>
A few changes that don&#x2019;t appear to have made it into this PTR pull are:<br>
<br>
<br>
Mortal Strike (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/12294-mortal-strike), Execute (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/163201-execute), Slam (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/1464-slam), and Rend (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/772-rend) damage increased 6%<br>
Deep Wounds (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/262304-deep-wounds) damage increased 12%<br>
<br>
<br>
Pretty straightforward&#x2013;the Deep Wounds buff is largest to boost the value of Mastery somewhat.</div></div>
