Becoming Illidari: A Look at the Demon Hunter<br>
Early access to the new Demon Hunter class will be available starting August 9 to those who have pre-purchased the Legion expansion and have at least one level 70 character on their realm. To help you prepare for your new role as one of the Illidari, we&#x2019;ve sent scouts into Mardum to learn more about this powerful hero.<br>
<br>
To begin your training, Game Designers Eric Maloof and Graham Berger team up to take you through the features of the Demon Hunter in this class preview video.<br>
<br>
<br>
One of the newest recruits to the Illidari, you&#x2019;ll begin your journey at level 98 in demon infested Mardum. As you make your way through this dangerous land, you&#x2019;ll begin to learn the skills of a Demon Hunter, their history, and become proficient in harnessing the power that goes along with your chosen path. Be warned &#x2013; not every Illidari makes it through. Ask yourself this question &#x2014;What are you willing to sacrifice to save Azeroth from the Burning Legion?<br>
<br>
Before you make your character, you&#x2019;ll need to know a little bit more about this hero class. In order to create a Demon Hunter, you&#x2019;ll need to have at least one level 70 character on your account. You&#x2019;ll also need to choose between two races within the character creation screen &#x2013; Night Elf or Blood Elf. To take part in the early access for the Demon Hunter, you&#x2019;ll also want to purchase (https://eu.battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-legion) the Legion expansion, though everyone who purchases the expansion will gain access when Legion releases on August 30.<br>
<br>
Here are just some of the great abilities you&#x2019;ll have to look forward to when you embrace the ways of the Illidari:<br>

Here are just some of the potent abilities you&#x2019;ll have at your disposal when you embrace the ways of the Illidari:<br>
<br>
Spectral Sight (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/188501-spectral-sight): Demon Hunters&#x2019; blindness belies their true powers of perception. They rely on magically augmented sight to detect enemies&#x2014;even those that hide behind obstacles.<br>
<br>
Metamorphosis: Demon Hunters transform into hellish forms, enhancing their formidable powers. Damage-focused Illidari (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/191427-metamorphosis) gain incredible swiftness and damage allowing them to finish their prey, while those who prize defense (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/187827-metamorphosis) become nigh invincible in their demonic forms.<br>
<br>
Demon Hunters also possess supernatural mobility: They can double-jump, vault in and out of combat, and even glide with their wings unfurled to unexpectedly descend upon their prey and surprise enemies from above.<br>
<br>

Warlords Season 3 PvP Disqualifications<br>
As part of our ongoing commitment to maintaining the integrity of Arena and Rated Battleground ladders, we&#x2019;ve been scouring the ladders regularly for players who engage in win-trading, boosting, and other such harmful activities. Historically, disqualifications have only taken place once a season has concluded, but we&#x2019;ve been performing these investigations throughout Warlords Season 3.<br>
<br>
As a result, we&#x2019;ve identified a number of accounts&#x2014;over 6,000 in total throughout the season&#x2014;that had engaged in such behavior. These players were explicitly and purposefully disrupting the rated ladders in an attempt to gain or provide other players an unfair advantage and/or rewards that they didn&#x2019;t deserve. As a result, the accounts that were identified as benefiting from these actions, as well as the accounts of the players who performed them, have been disqualified from earning rewards in Warlords Season 3.<br>
<br>
Among the most recently affected players were some from teams that had qualified for our upcoming Road to BlizzCon 2016 regional tournaments. Following a thorough investigation of these accounts, these players are also disqualified&#x2014;and as stated in the official tournament rules (NA, EU), these players are now ineligible to continue competing in this year&#x2019;s Road to BlizzCon. Affected teams will be contacted by Blizzard and allowed to use their one roster swap (if available) to bring in another player so that they can continue competing. Should a team be unable to maintain a roster of at least three players, they will be disqualified and replaced with the runner-up team from the same qualifier cup.<br>
<br>
We are committed to upholding the integrity and competitive nature of our ladders. We&#x2019;re looking forward to a truly epic Road to BlizzCon, and can&#x2019;t wait to see how things progress into Regionals and the Legion expansion.</div></div>
