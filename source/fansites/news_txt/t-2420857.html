How to Level Quicker in Battle for Azeroth<br>
If you are a player who is interested mostly in max level content, there are ways of speeding up your leveling process. <br>
<br>
Essential Items<br>
Before the new expansion is released, there are a few items that you should stock up on.<br>
<br>
Potion of Prolonged Power (https://www.wowdb.com/items/142117-potion-of-prolonged-power): a nice stat increase that you should be using every time before combat, especially during the first few levels<br>
Defiled Augment Runes (https://www.wowdb.com/items/140587-defiled-augment-rune), or a Lightforged Augment Rune (https://www.wowdb.com/items/153023-lightforged-augment-rune) if you have the required reputation for it. These are a small stat increase, but as long as you always keep one active, they will help out a little.<br>
Flasks: main stat increase that you should always have active<br>
Food that increases your secondary stats. You can either stick with food that gives 375, or craft some Sugar-Crusted Fish Feasts (https://www.wowdb.com/items/126936-sugar-crusted-fish-feast), which give Versatility instantly after sitting down to eat<br>
Drums of Fury (https://www.wowdb.com/items/120257-drums-of-fury): great for speeding up fights against named enemies<br>
Goblin Glider Kit (https://www.wowdb.com/items/109076-goblin-glider-kit): unless you&#x2019;re a Demon Hunter, you should probably have a few of these to help you easily get to places from mountains.<br>
Reins of the Azure Water Strider (https://www.wowdb.com/items/81354-reins-of-the-azure-water-strider): having a mount that can walk on water can be very beneficial at times<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Legendaries<br>
During your leveling process, legendaries will be available up to level 116, after which they just become items with high ilvl.<br>
Depending on the class and specialization you play, you will want to have at least two gear sets saved, but there may be more.<br>
<br>
Combat Gear Set: this is what you will wear for most of your leveling process. Keep in mind that items such as Sephuz&apos;s Secret (https://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret) can be procced on cooldown while leveling, as long as you have an ability to do so.<br>
Speed Set: moving around faster saves a lot of time when leveling. <br>
Optional Defensive and AoE Set: if you feel like you might be a little undergeared, a defensive set to help you kill named enemies might be necessary. You can also make a gear set with AoE legendaries if want to group up more mobs.<br>
Level 116 and Above: because legendaries lose their special effect, at this point you will want to equip two legendaries with the most stats on them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Artifact Weapon<br>
Hold on to any high ilvl relics you might have, even if they have bad traits on them. The artifact traits and relics become inactive while leveling, so having your weapon be at its highest possible ilvl will be the only thing that matters.<br>
<br>
<br>
War Mode<br>
Unless you&#x2019;re uncomfortable with PvP, you should definitely enable War Mode for the 10% experience bonus, and the access to 3 new talents. PvP talents can offer very nice offensive, as well as defensive options when leveling, which on certain classes will speed up this process significantly. <br>
<br>
<br>
Add-Ons<br>
There are a few Add-Ons which can help you out during leveling, especially when it comes to pathing, and efficiency. Azeroth Auto Pilot (https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/azeroth-auto-pilot) (from the creator of ConsLegion) will guide you through a predetermined questing path, and give you specific directions on exactly what you should be doing. It also has a few other features, such as automatically accepting and turning in quests, which saves time.<br>
If you want to follow your own questing path, you should use Auto Quest Turn In (https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/autoturnin).<br>
<br>
<br>
Leveling Tips<br>
Here are some suggestions to make the process as efficient as possible.<br>
<br>
<br>
The first expansion quest kicks off in Silithus, so you can wait at Magni for release. He will give you the Heart of Azeroth (https://www.wowdb.com/items/158075-heart-of-azeroth) and your first Azerite Armor Piece. <br>
Level through your continent&apos;s 3 zones -<br>
<br>
Suggested Alliance Order - Drustvar then Tiragarde Sound then Stormsong Valley<br>
Suggested Horde Order - Zuldazar then Nazmir then Vol&apos;dun<br>
<br>
Save your foothold War Campaign quests for after you complete a zone. Doing all 3 gives about one level. After your first zone is complete return to your capital hub to start the quest.<br>
Instead of vendoring quest rewards, take them to the scrapper (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7872-Battle-for-Azeroth-Professions-Overview#scrapper) after each zone. This will reward you with reagents and Expulsom (https://www.wowdb.com/items/152668-expulsom) (the new Blood of Sargeras).<br>
At 120 you will mainly gear up by queuing for normal dungeons (item level 310 gear) until you have a item level 305 and can gear for heroic dungeons (item level 325 gear). <br>
Make sure to do your 10 Regular Mythic Dungeons for the week. (Note that you can manually zone into heroic dungeons with a 5 man group under the required item level.) <br>
You need to have all reputations to friendly to unlock Battle for Azeroth world quests. Finish up any lingering quests until you make this requirement.<br>
Prioritize the Champions of Azeroth reputation as each rank gives you +15 item level to your Heart of Azeroth (https://www.wowdb.com/items/158075-heart-of-azeroth), as well as a 355 item level Azerite Armor piece at exalted. Purchase a Contract: Champions of Azeroth (https://www.wowdb.com/items/153668-contract-champions-of-azeroth) as soon as possible!<br>
You will want to work on getting 7th Legion / Honorbound reputations to revered for the War Campaign Completion and to unlock the Allied Races.<br>

New Continentscontinents<br>
Battle for Azeroth introduces two new continents with 3 zones each to explore! Each faction levels in their respective zone and utilizes both continents for max level. Click the maps below for in depth previews!<br>
<br>
<br>
Kul Tiras (Alliance) - Tiragarde Sound, Drustvar, and Stormsong Valley<br>
Zandalar (Horde) - Zuldazar, Nazmir, and Vol&apos;dun<br>

Heart of Azeroth Necklace and Azerite Armor Systemheartazerite<br>
Battle for Azeroth has a new system of gear progression that involves the new Artifact necklace you receive right away, Heart of Azeroth (https://www.wowdb.com/items/158075-heart-of-azeroth), and Azerite Armor slots. Click below for a complete guide on how this new system works.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Island Expeditionsislandexpeditions<br>
Battle for Azeroth brings a new Island Expeditions feature. Taking what the team liked from Mists of Pandaria&apos;s scenarios and stepping it up, these expeditions take a team of three players to uncharted islands across the Great sea in search of Azerite against advanced AI opponents.<br>
<br>
<br>
The first team to collect a certain amount of Azerite wins. <br>
Each island is randomly generated and so there is always something unique and new to find. <br>
The enemy AI does not behave like normal scripted creature AI. They will fight in a much more unpredictable way. <br>
Island Expeditions are role agnostic, meaning that they do not require a Tank, Healer and DPS in order to succeed.<br>
Difficulties include Normal, Heroic and Mythic.<br>
There is also a PvP mode where the enemy AI is replaced with 3 players of the opposite faction.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Warfrontswarfronts<br>
Warfronts are 20 man PvE large scale battles in which a team fights for control of a strategic point against the opposite faction AI.<br>
<br>
<br>
Stromgarde in Arathi Highlands is the first Warfront.<br>
Each faction will periodically take control of Arathi Highlands by doing a Warfront.<br>
The faction who doesn&apos;t control Arathi Highlands contributes resources to open up the ability to get it back.<br>
Having control of Arathi Highlands gives you access to rares and a world boss.<br>
Gear is a reward for completing a Warfront.<br>

These seasons will also feature seasonal affixes. Season One will have Infested (https://www.wowdb.com/affixes/16-infested).<br>
Tyrannical (https://www.wowdb.com/affixes/9-tyrannical) and Fortified (https://www.wowdb.com/affixes/10-fortified) are now Keystone Level 2 affixes, meaning every Mythic Plus dungeon will contain one or the other.<br>

Battle for Azeroth World Questsworldquests<br>
Battle for Azeroth has continued the world quest system and there is a multitude of new quests and emissaries. To unlock world quests you must reach Level 120 and complete the quest Uniting Kul Tiras (https://beta.wowdb.com/quests/51918-uniting-kul-tiras) (A) or Uniting Zandalar (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/51916-uniting-zandalar) (H). This means that you must also have completed the War Campaign quests up this point, which involves doing all three war campaign foothold quests in the zones on the opposite continent.<br>
<br>
<br>
Emissaries can reward Azerite Armor Caches.<br>
Each faction will have World Quests on both continents at max level.<br>
World Quests are a good source of Azerite.<br>
World Quests can also give bonus reputation as a reward.<br>

Battle for Azeroth Professionsprofessions<br>
As with any expansion, Battle for Azeroth offers a variety of new recipes and items to craft or gather. Click below to find out just what is being added for each profession!<br>
<br>
<br>
Kul Tiran and Zandalari Professions are now available to learn and level!<br>
Each profession is separated into expansions and leveled separately from one another. <br>
Each expansion has its own leveling path for items from that expansion, similar to the Mists of Pandaria cooking. <br>
You can choose to go back and level older expansion crafting, or you can simply level the current expansion. <br>
This allows you to craft items with current expansion materials without needing older expansion materials to level.<br>
You can still go back and level older expansion crafting skills as well. <br>
To clarify further, an example of this means that you can level your &quot;Cataclysm Tailoring&quot; by crafting Cataclysm patterns, but this doesn&apos;t stop you from progressing your &quot;Kul Tiran / Zandalari Tailoring&quot; with the new expansion&apos;s patterns.<br>
First Aid is gone (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7414-Armory-Stats-First-Aid-Court-of-Stars-22-Solo-New-Overwatch-Hero-BfA-CE-Listing) and its patterns are redistributed into Tailoring and Alchemy. Your First Aid crafts will have to be relearned in their respective new profession.<br>
