Guild Pane Still Exists
Some players have noticed that old guild pane features didn't make it to the community system. The old guild pane with features such as sorting by last online is still there, just type "/guildroster". Thanks to Annaisha for the tip!

Unfortunately there doesn't appear to be a way to use the old permissions system with more fine grained permissions, your only option now is the grouped permissions. This means you can't do things like allow members to edit their own notes anymore.

Legion Companion App Change
Thanks to DarthRigo https://twitter.com/DarthRigo who posted a thread on our forums https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2412920-Blizzard-broke-the-Wow-app-intentionally?p=49765173&viewfull=1#post49765173 and tweeted BlizzardCS https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS, we have learned that the switch characters button in the Legion Companion app was intentionally removed. It is now a little more involved to switch between your characters.

Wargames in Battle for Azeroth
Wargames aren't in the core UI, but you can type /wg to challenge the targeted player. Blue Tracker https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1095894-wargames-removed-in-bfa/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20765456758?page=1#3

Battle Chest and the "New" System
The Battle Chest basically doesn't exist as a standalone purchase anymore.

You make your Starter Edition, you add game time and then you immediately have access to all expansions up to, and including, Legion - no need to actually make a separate purchase of the Battle Chest anymore in order to upgrade the account. The only thing you would need to purchase separately is Battle for Azeroth.

Alternatively, if a player wants to jump straight into the latest action on a new account - they can buy the Complete Collection which includes 30 days of game-time so unlocking access to all previous expansions and Battle for Azeroth including the level 110 character boost.
