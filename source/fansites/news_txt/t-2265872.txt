Chronicle shows us that demons always rez in the Nether. Now it shows Antorus to be the source? Ret-con or explained in game? 
I assume you're referring to Turalyon's dialogue? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/890413121763819520
That is where most people get to and then become confused. So I would say yes that dialogue is a point to clarify.

Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
What do you think about progression systems in online games with realistically achievable end point? Should there be a point when the progression ends with a “sense of accomplishment”?
If the endpoint is too easily achievable, that gives players an opportunity to take a break from the game. That can be a good thing if they come back to your game refreshed, but it can be a bad thing if they take a long or permanent break because they’ve run out of content.

Now, I totally agree that a sense of a accomplishment is important. As gamers, we enjoy filling in bars, but if that bar is filling in really slowly, and if that bar is really long, we may just recognize the futility of our effort and give it up. Progress is important. The best game do this by having multiple bars so that just as you finish one accomplishment, there is something slightly different that is also nearing completion. Consider Civilization. You might be finishing a battle in one part of the map, and then spend a couple of turns finishing an important tech, and then discover you are about to found a new city, and so on. The loop wouldn’t be as compelling if you were only progressing along one axis at a time and saw how far you had to go to get that sense of completion.

Also, this is really important: the kicker here is that “realistically achievable” isn’t a single number. If you play two hours a month and I play four hours a day, then what is achievable for you may be trivial for me. This is very common.
