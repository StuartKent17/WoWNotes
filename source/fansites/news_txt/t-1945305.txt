Greater Blessing of Might
Maybe the developers themselves could chime in here, but it seems obvious to me that both Rets and Enhance shaman will have their own damage output reduced to account for the extra damage they are providing to other players. That just seems obvious to me, since if the specs do as much damage as other melee DPS while also providing 10% more damage to other players, people will stack only those melee classes to the exclusion of all else.
Stormlash and Greater Blessings are indeed intended to be numerically valuable contributions to group success from Enhancement and Retribution part of their fantasy is in buffing their allies. Their damage or other effects should be attributed to the Enhancement/Retribution player, as far as contribution to the group's damage goes. We'll ensure that the combat logging events are there to allow this to be done.

EDIT: We still welcome feedback/discussion on these abilities, of course. Just wanted to clear up the question of how their effects should be attributed. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Curious: How many expansions in advance did you work on? Do you know what comes after Legion for example?
At the end of MoP, we had WoD mostly planned and Legion discussed. I found out its name when you did though. OccupyGStreet 
I don't know what comes after Legion. OccupyGStreet 

or continued to do, WoD was announced 11.8.13 you left in December, you saying you didn't work on WoD?
I did but very little. I playtested a few quests. We had some rough ideas for garrisons. OccupyGStreet 

Sort of relevant, but why is bring back eyes of the beast so hard? Why can't they program it now when you...
It's not hard. It's just not free. A week of that engineer's time is a week she's not working on something else. OccupyGStreet
