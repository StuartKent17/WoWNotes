Conquest Rewards Adjustment - Oct. 23
With weekly maintenance in each region, we've adjusted some Conquest rewards for Rated Battlegrounds.

Now, when you Rated Battleground ends in defeat, depending on how closely you lost how near to the winning team in points/flag captures/etc., you can gain 20-40 Conquest. Additionally:

2v2 – First win of the day rewards 35 Conquest; additional wins rewards 25 Conquest was 10. Rated Battlegrounds – First win of the day rewards 150 Conquest was 100; additional wins reward 100 Conquest was 65.

Rewards for 3v3 and unrated Battlegrounds have not been changed.

PSA: We're currently working on a hotfix that will increase the gold and Azerite rewards from Emissary quests. We hope to have this change live within the next 24 hours, so if you have an active Emissary that rewards gold or Azerite, you may want to wait to complete it!

With weekly maintenance in each region, we’ve increased the Conquest gained from 2v2 Arenas by 250%, and Rated Battlegrounds by 50%. See our thread here https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769708072 for the details. WarcraftDevs

In the newest PTR build, Flaskzertauren will be selling new chest and shoulder items that contain the newest Azerite traits for testing.
Flaskzertauren is located in The Great Seal of Dazar’alor for Horde, and the Harbormaster’s Office in Boralus for Alliance. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1052671582865305601

Do I need to have my artifact weapon equipped to be able to do the "win ten rated battlegrounds" tint unlock now that BfA is out? I'm not sure if the weapon scales for pvp which would make winning difficult.
You don’t need to have your Artifact weapon equipped or transmogged onto the weapon you're using in order to earn progress towards unlocking any Artifact look or tint. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1052258959367626752

Raid Testing Schedule - October 25th-26th
On Thursday, October 25th and Friday, October 26th we will be conducting raid tests of the Battle of Dazar'alor. 

BOTH FACTIONS:
Testing is open for both factions. However, for some bosses, raid members will temporarily re-live events as the opposite faction using a story flashback.

Thursday, October 25th

King Rastakhan- Heroic Battle of Dazar'alor
13:00 PDT 16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST
Horde will experience this boss as if they were Alliance.
High Tinker Mekkatorque - Heroic Battle of Dazar'alor
14:00 PDT 17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST
Alliance will experience this boss as if they were Horde. 

Friday, October 26th

Champion of the Light: Frida Ironbellows Horde / Ra’Wani Alliance - Mythic Battle of Dazar'alor
13:00 PDT 16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST
Each faction will test their respective Champion of the Light boss 
Stormwall Blockade - Heroic Battle of Dazar'alor
14:00 PDT 17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST
Alliance will experience this boss as if they were Horde. 

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a test environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.

Q: How do I get into the raid zone?
A: In Zuldazar, Boralus, Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade III in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.

Q: What character should I use to test the raid?
A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players' effective level to 120 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounters being tested. 

Q: How long does testing last?
A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we're satisfied that we've received that information for a given boss, we'll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.
