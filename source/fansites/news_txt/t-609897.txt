World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King: Beta</p> </font> <font face=arial size=2> <ul> Welcome to the World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King Beta Test. The list below contains information on the current available content for testing and general information. &#32;This information is subject to change. Alpha testers should note that your characters have been temporarily locked out. &#32;In a few weeks time, we will unlock these characters and you will be able to continue to level them. Please visit the Beta forums  to submit feedback and discuss the expansion development with others. [/list]

General <ul> The continent of Northrend is now available! &#32;To travel there, visit one of four transportation masters in either Orgrimmar, Undercity, Stormwind Harbor,or Menethil Harbor. The floating magical city of Dalaran is now available! The Barber Shop has been implemented and you can now visit one of the Barber Shops in the major cities to change your appearance. The all new Achievement System has been implemented. Transportation between Howling Fjord and Borean Tundra can be found at the Tuskarr villages in those zones. The level cap is currently set to 77. Hit Rating, Critical Strike Rating, and Haste Rating now modify both melee attacks and spells. Spellpower: &#32; &#32;<ul> All items and effects which grant bonuses to spell damage and spell healing are being consolidated into a single stat, Spellpower. &#32;This stat will appear with the same values found on items which grant “increased spell damage and healing” such as on typical Mage and Warlock itemization. For classes which do not heal, they should see no change in the character sheet other than new tooltip wording. Healing characters will see their bonus healing numbers on the character sheet decrease, however, all healing spells have been modified to receive more benefit from spellpower than they received from bonus healing, with a net effect of no change to the amount healed by their spells. &#32;Some talents have had to be rebalanced to accommodate this change, but the amount healed will remain roughly the same. &#32;In addition, some talents will provide only healing spell power.
