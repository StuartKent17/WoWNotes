<br>
Patch 4.3 Raid Preview: Dragon Soul<br>
World of Warcraft patch 4.3 will offer players the opportunity to take the fight to Wyrmrest Temple and beyond, assisting Thrall and the Dragon Aspects as they seek to bring an end to the Black Dragonflight once and for all. 10- and 25-person raids will get to take on Deathwing himself, with three levels of difficulty to consider and epic gear to claim.<br>
<br>
Forged by Deathwing during the War of the Ancients, the Dragon Soul harnessed the power of the other dragonflights, until it was ultimately destroyed. After recovering a version of the artifact from the Caverns of Time, Thrall and the allied dragonflights now rally at Wyrmrest Temple in a desperate bid to use its might to defeat Deathwing.<br>
<br>
Created by the titans as a sanctuary for all Dragonkind, the crumbling Wyrmrest Temple is now the final hope for the forces allied against the black dragon Neltharion, once the Earth-Warder and protector of Azeroth, now Deathwing the Destroyer. It is here that the remaining aspects -- Alexstrasza, Ysera, Nozdormu, Kalecgos, and Thrall -- have gathered to empower the Dragon Soul -- Azeroth&apos;s last chance to stop the great behemoth. As they begin to charge the Dragon Soul with energy, Deathwing and his entire army assault Wyrmrest Temple. Players must thwart the attacking forces long enough for Thrall to charge the Dragon Soul.<br>
<br>
Before you face Deathwing the Destroyer, you must prevail against six mighty bosses.<br>
<br>
The most powerful elemental still under Deathwing&apos;s sway, Morchok -- once a passive guardian -- is now convinced that his only respite will come with Azeroth&apos;s demise. Morchok rages against the foundation of Wyrmrest Temple, Azeroth&apos;s last beacon of hope in the Hour of Twilight.<br>
<br>
Countless ages ago, Warlord Zon&apos;ozz and his soldiers waged endless war against the forces of C&apos;Thun and Yogg-Saron. Millennia have passed, but the warlord still serves the chaotic might of the Old God N&apos;Zoth. Deathwing has now unleashed this legendary faceless one to crush the defenders of Wyrmrest Temple.<br>

<br>
Since the fall of the Bastion of Twilight, Yor&apos;sahj the Unsleeping has eagerly assisted Deathwing, providing the Destroyer with the means to release more faceless ones from their prisons deep beneath the earth. Their numbers are endless and their power is beyond reckoning, and Yor&apos;sahj intends to reap a grim reward for his faithful service.<br>

<br>
Hagara the Binder, one of the first students of arcane magic under the Forsaken, showed surprising potential for one who had started learning so late in life. But in her undisciplined attempts to bind elementals into servitude, she was ensnared and twisted by the Windlord, Al&apos;Akir. Now fiercely loyal to the Twilight&apos;s Hammer, Hagara binds others for her elemental masters to torment.<br>
<br>
More an abomination of dark energy than a dragon, Ultraxion has spent his short life absorbing the essence of captured nether dragons. Ultraxion is the only twilight dragon Deathwing has praised, and his arrogance is overshadowed only by the crackling energies surging through his twisted form. Loyal to his master, Ultraxion swears to bring about the fall of Wyrmrest Temple.<br>
<br>

<br>
Though once vast in number, only a few dozen twilight dragons now remain. Astride these hardened survivors are the last vestiges of the Twilight&apos;s Hammer&apos;s army: the elite drake riders of Deathwing&apos;s personal escort. Led by the insidious Warmaster Blackhorn, they move with unholy purpose, driven to protect their dark master.<br>
<br>

<br>
When Deathwing first channeled the Dragon Soul&apos;s power against the other dragonflights, the massive energies that he unleashed threatened to break him apart. Rather than forgo this weapon, he had adamantium plates fused to his scales to hold his body together. Later reinforced with elementium, these plates are now his weakness -- the sole vulnerability to Deathwing&apos;s lethal presence.<br>
<br>
Your assault on the massive Deathwing will begin a battle unlike any other. It is a fight so wide-ranging and intense that it comprises two unique encounters, taking place across Azeroth. Taking to the skies, players will parachute from soaring gunships to attack the monster mid-flight and attempt to weaken him by ripping away his armor, exposing the molten flesh beneath. Should they succeed, they will plunge into the depths of Maelstrom for the final encounter.<br>
<br>
No adventurer has yet taken on an enemy so large and dangerous and lived to tell the tale. Will you?<br>

Transmogrification Rules<br>
Since we announced the transmogrification feature coming to World of Warcraft with patch 4.3, we have monitored thousands of follow-up comments, questions and suggestions from players all over the world.<br>
<br>
What follows is our current list of rules for transmogrification. This is a set of rules that we expect to change over time, and is not intended to be 100% comprehensive, but we hope that it can be referenced to answer most questions that players currently have about what they can and cannot expect to be able to do with transmogrification.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The character must be able to equip both items.<br>
Only uncommon (green), rare (blue) or epic (purple) items may be transmogrified. (exceptions: a select few of these items will prevented from being used to transmogrify if they are inappropriate)<br>
Items must share the same armor type (examples: plate for plate, cloth for cloth)<br>
Weapons must be the same weapon type (exceptions: Guns, Crossbows, or Bows)<br>
Guns, Crossbows, and Bows can be used to transmogrify Guns, Crossbows, or Bows.<br>
Main hand weapons can only be used to transmogrify Main hand weapons.<br>
