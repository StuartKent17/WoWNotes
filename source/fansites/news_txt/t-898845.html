General<br>
<br>
An issue was preventing some players from properly mailing account bound items to other characters on the same realm and Battle.net account. If you are still experiencing this issue, we recommend you log into both characters before sending the mail. The characters don&#x2019;t need to be online at the same time for this to work.<br>
Children&#x2019;s Week quests should no longer be unavailable to players who recently transferred factions.<br>
Flying wisp form and flying mounts, both living and dead, can enter bodies of water smoothly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Classes<br>
<br>
Spells or talents which provide pushback protection should now be functioning correctly (i.e. Burning Soul for mages or Suppression for warlocks). This time we mean it.<br>
<br>

<br>
Shadowstep is instantly teleporting players behind their target when the target is in motion.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br>
<br>
Call to Arms rewards will now be displayed in the Dungeon Finder UI while a player is in the dungeon so they know what rewards they will get.<br>
<br>
<br>
Throne of the Four Winds<br>
<br>
Damage from Ice Storm in phase 1 of Al&#x2019;Akir is ticking twice per second, which was causing excessive damage on Heroic difficulty. To compensate, the damage per tick has been reduced for Heroic difficulty.<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Players are now able to get a random Darkmoon card inside of a Sealed Scroll Case, instead of always getting a Darkmoon Card of Destruction.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quests &amp; Creatures<br>
<br>
The Innkeeper&apos;s Daughter can no longer be targeted for healing or harmful effects.<br>
Players now fail The Crucible of Carnage: The Earl of Evisceration when killed by Lord Geoffery Tulvan during the encounter. Players are able to pick up the quest after it is failed and the event starts again without issue.</div></div>
