A lot of people have been reporting lower experience requirements from level 60 to 70, this is an intended change !
Yes, we're planning on speeding up leveling in the 60-70 range. Keep the feedback coming. We are still adjusting it. Let us know what levels you are in what areas in this bracket.


Halls of Stone - Loot Table
Finally, we've got the first items dropping from the Halls of Stone http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=796 in Storm Peaks. This instance is tuned for LVL 77 to 79 players and will probably offer the first alternatives to Sunwell loot. The first weapon we discovered, Unrelenting Blade http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/wotlk/items/rare/rareitem_065.jpg reaches 117 DPS and is bind on equip ! as a comparison [item=34329] drops on Kil'jaeden and goes "only" as high as 114.2 DPS.
