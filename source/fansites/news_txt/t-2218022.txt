PvP
So, I have the Merc Buff but I zoned in Horde side. Is it not possible to go merc for Warsong Scramble? 
Correct. Mercenary Mode does not apply to PvP Brawls. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/859955137032278019


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
As someone who played very very little WoW yet interested in its class design can you explain the design of the Rogue combo system?
They use a resource energy which regenerates over short time frames. So it’s possible to go all out, but have enough resources to be able to push buttons again in a relatively short time compared to say mana. We always liked this design because it’s very easy for rotations to fall into a pattern of “you must always push X when it is on cooldown.” Energy regeneration adds an extra wrinkle to this discussion.

Then, there are basically two kinds of abilities. Things that generate combo points and things that consume combo points to cause big damage. It has that satisfying feel of pulling something off much like a fighting game combo, can deliver high burst moments which feels very rogue-like, but also has the similar benefit of energy in that you have a reason to use both kinds of attacks rather than always just spamming the same button over and over.

Rogues had maybe still have the added nuance that the combo points are on the target not on the rogue, so you can’t just switch targets at a moment’s notice which has interesting nuance for PvE and PvP. Sometimes it’s worth sticking to your current target until you can pull off a finisher. Other times, it’s worth abandoning those.

I have often said that I think rogues had the best designed resource system in WoW, but that we didn’t want to just copy that for every other class, or it might feel less special.

As with any WoW answer, my info might be very out of date. Source https://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/160282117618/as-someone-who-played-very-very-little-wow-yet

ESPN has an article http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/19347153/teams-hesitant-buy-overwatch-league-due-high-cost-undesirable-contract-terms stating that Blizzard is struggling to sign franchises for the Overwatch league due to unfavorable terms. Blizzard released a statement https://esports.yahoo.com/blizzard-officially-responds-overwatch-league-rumors-190546691.html to say that things are going well and someone may be trying to spread misinformation for bargaining reasons. 


There is a $20 million franchise fee
Teams are not guaranteed revenue sharing until after 2021 and only if Blizzard meets certain criteria
If a team sells its spot to another party, the league would receive 25 percent of the proceeds
