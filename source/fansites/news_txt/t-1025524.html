WoW Turns 7! Anniversary Tabard now available in-game<br>
World of Warcraft turns 7 this year (see World of Warcraft&#x2019;s Seventh Anniversary! (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2558-World-of-Warcraft%E2%80%99s-Seventh-Anniversary-New-WoW-TV-Spot) and to celebrate, players will be awarded a tabard and the WoW&apos;s 7th Anniversary (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5863/wows-7th-anniversary/) Feat of Strength. The celebration lasts from November 20 to December 3, this is a visual tabard and it will not unequip your current tabard. <br>
<br>
Update - I just realized that the &quot;Celebration Package&quot; item summoning the tabard requires the 7th anniversary event to be active, it most likely means that this item will expire. Might want to wait for a blue confirmation on that before you go through all your alts to get it.<br>
