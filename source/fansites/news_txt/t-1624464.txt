Warlords of Draenor - Stormwind Repairs
It looks like the previously mentioned Stormwind Repairs  won't make it in this expansion after all.


  


Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons: Stables
The Stables  takes up a Large plot which can also be used for a Mage Tower / Spirit Lodge , Gnomish Gearworks / Goblin Workshop , Dwarven Bunker / War Mill , or Barracks  Once upgraded to Tier 3, your garrison will have two Large plots available.

Abilities
This building is good for collecting additional mounts, moving faster in Draenor, and gathering faster in Draenor. Some of the mounts that you have marked as favorites will walk around your Stables, allowing you to show them off.


Level 1 - Enables the capture and training of special mounts on Draenor. Also allows you remain mounted while interacting with objects in outdoor Draenor zones.
Level 2 - You will no longer get dazed by enemies while riding mounts in outdoor Draenor zones.
Level 3 - Increases mount speed in Draenor by 20%.



Level 3 Unlock
The Level 3 version of this building is unlocked by completing the Master of Mounts  achievement, which requires you to unlock all six mounts that the Stables provides.


Trained Mounts
The Stables  allow you to complete a series of quests to collect six different mounts. Initially you must capture a mount, which will open access to other quests that require you to train with it. After a sufficient amount of training  has been done, you are ready to learn the mount. These mounts will remain yours to use even if you replace the building with another.

Blazing Wings and Shapeshift Forms
There were some issues with certain cosmetic effects, such as Blazing Wings, attaching to shapeshift forms incorrectly e.g. backwards, upside-down, etc. We had to disable them temporarily, but we've isolated the issues causing the bug, and should have it fixed for the next major patch. We think a feral Druid with fiery wings is going to look pretty sweet too.

Longer-term, we're working on a way to allow cosmetic toys that completely take over your character such as Smite's Brass Compass or Krastinov's Bag of Horrors to work with shapeshift forms as well. I don't have details to share on exactly how that's going to work yet, but we're working on a solution that will allow everyone to enjoy their toys, without hurting gameplay for other players such as being able to recognize when a Druid is in Cat form and thus unable to be Polymorphed.

Any chance we could make it so friendly Earthquake doesn't show up or looks different? It's annoying as a melee.
We'll likely hide Earthquake for allies of the caster hotfix, and work on a chilled-out visual for a later patch. WatcherDev 

PvP
Where Dota-like games an inspiration for some concepts of ashran? like respawning at your base to balance the lane push
It was more based on Alterac Valley holinka

you said you would maybe revisit it, would you consider moving the horde event to Orgrimmar since its the main capital like SW?
It's a Forsaken holiday, so no. _DonAdams

BlizzCon 2014 Live Raid - Method vs. Midwinter
The ongoing battle between two raiding behemoths continues! This year’s BlizzCon World of Warcraft Live Raid will once again pit Horde guild Method EU-Twisting Nether  against Alliance guild Midwinter US-Sargeras  in a battle for PvE supremacy. 

These two teams of exceptionally skilled raiders will be testing their mettle in the unreleased of Warlords of Draenor Raid dungeon Highmaul on Heroic difficulty. What could possibly go wrong?

Each Raid team will have a trio of representatives on stage—and when the battle begins, they’ll need every ounce of your support wherever you’re watching BlizzCon from.

Representing Midwinter on stage will be:

Gondlem – Windwalker Monk
Slootbag – Protection Paladin
Kaowa – Assassination Rogue


Representing Method on stage will be:

Blatty – Arcane Mage
Rogerbrown – Marksmanship Hunter
Treckie – Protection Paladin


World of Warcraft lead game designer Ion “Watcher” Hazzikostas will be joined on stage by community manager Josh “Lore” Allen to provide commentary on the Live Raid. 

If you’re attending BlizzCon 2014 in person, join us Saturday morning at 10 a.m. PST in Hall D to witness the epic battle—otherwise, you can tune in to watch the race live from the comfort of your home with the Virtual Ticket.
