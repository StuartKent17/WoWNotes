Thanks and Praises to the WoW Community
As we’re about to take a little break for the holidays to spend time with our friends and loved ones, perhaps by the fire with ardent spirits filling our goblets, and frankincense and myrrh nipping at our noses—or really just getting in some much desired game time—we want to wish all of you a very merry journey into the new year!

In a most festive and potentially damning fashion, we put together this picture of the North American World of Warcraft community team for you.

Front from left: Brennvin, Daxxarri, Nethaera, Bashiok 

If that doesn’t provide you with sufficient joy, here are some unedited individual shots of us. I can’t tell you how ill-advised it would be of me to suggest that you manipulate these images as you see fit. It would be especially inappropriate to then ask that you send your strange interpretations to us on Twitter. That seems quite absurd!


                

It’s truly been a pleasure for us to represent Blizzard and the World of Warcraft community to each other this past year. We’re anxious to hit the ground running in January, and we look forward to sharing in the adventure with you. Have a lovely holiday, all!
