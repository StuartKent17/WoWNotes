Another day, another kill by Paragon (http://www.paragon.fi/) who was the first guild to defeat the Ascendant Council of the Twilight Bastion in the world. Congratulations to them!<br>
<br>
The second day of year 2011 brought us Ascendant Council 25-man heroic mode kill. This was one of the fights we were most looking forward to after beta testing. It was a huge letdown for some, but others enjoyed it. Somewhat bittersweet.<br>
<br>
Also, a big thank you for the melee DPS&apos;ers who play in the guild. They had to pass up spots again for alts, simply because the encounter design is incredibly punishing for any melee. It&apos;s a pretty glaring oversight when bringing in more than one or two of them results in ridiculous increases in damage taken in the last phase due to non-stop chaining chain lightning. Dropping out melee characters in favor of ranged ones has been a recurring theme throughout this whole raiding tier, but we hope that it&apos;s over now with only the end bosses and Sinestra left.<br>
<br>
Here&apos;s to hoping next tier of raiding won&apos;t favor ranged by design. Maybe even go wild and give some incentive to bring in melee, too. (Paragon.fi (http://www.paragon.fi/node/199))<br>
