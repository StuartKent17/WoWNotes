MMO-Champion&apos;s 10 Year Anniversary<br>
<br>
For an entire decade, MMO-Champion has strived to provide its users with timely World of Warcraft news, including the latest patch notes and previews of upcoming game content. It&#x2019;s been years of daily site updates, late nights collecting game information, and weekends filled with surprise patches - and it&#x2019;s all been worth it. Many World of Warcraft players rely on MMO-Champion to stay informed, and we appreciate the dedication you&#x2019;ve shown us over the years. Thanks for being here to celebrate our 10th anniversary with us today.<br>
<br>
To recognize this fantastic achievement, we&#x2019;re celebrating the most important part of MMO-Champion - our users. We have giveaways, trivia, a new site feature, and a collection of a few of the most interesting news posts from the last 10 years.<br>
<br>
Here&#x2019;s to another decade of MMO-Champion!<br>
