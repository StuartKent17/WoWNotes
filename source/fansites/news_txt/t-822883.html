Happy New Year to everyone! 2011 should get interesting very soon with a minor class balancing patch incoming in the next few weeks (see Upcoming Class Changes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2127-Upcoming-Class-Changes-December-27-Hotfixes)) and probably patch 4.1 following a few weeks later. <br>
<br>
For the moment, I&apos;m sure most of you still have to level/gear up and try to see most of the content available in the expansion and you probably still have a few days without work to succeed. <br>
