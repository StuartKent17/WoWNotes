Just to clear the confusion, there was a small segment in yesterday&apos;s E3 interview with IGN in which we weren&apos;t entirely clear - but we want to clarify that Blood Trolls are not currently planned as an Allied Race. <br>
<br>
It can be easy to mix up words in interviews when you&apos;re covering a range of story points such as that of the Blood Trolls and their interactions with the Zandalari - but we just wanted to be sure we could get a note out on this before we get more Allied Race rumors flying around. <br>
<br>
Thanks for the discussion here!</div></div>
