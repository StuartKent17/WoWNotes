Warlords of Draenor - Upcoming Beta Additions<br>
It looks like upcoming beta builds (next week (https://twitter.com/ckaleiki/status/489208570756362240)) will give us Gorgrond, Talador, and Ashran!<br>
<br>

Warlords of Draenor - 7/15 Beta Invite Wave<br>
A sizable invite wave went out tonight, allowing many more people to join the beta testing for Warlords of Draenor. Bashiok also explained a little bit more about how invite targeting works.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/betaWaves.png (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/489134331621699585) <br>
<br>
Targeting was at subscription length + recent activity of accounts who are (of course) opted in to beta test on the website. So account creation date wasn&apos;t necessarily a factor, although of course those with a lot of sub time also have old accounts. Also it was a target and not a guarantee, and so certainly not everyone who has been playing a long time got one.<br>
<br>
But more are going out to opt-ins every week, and there are fansite and gaming news site giveaways. Plenty of additional opportunities every week.<br>

does everyone get a base multistrike %? Don&apos;t have beta yet so can&apos;t test<br>
No, no global base amount. A few specs have passives which some though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/486984248239202304))<br>
...which *grant* some. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/486984348726358016))<br>

also also about mirror images. Giving mages an ability we&apos;ve had for years as a lvl90 talent isn&apos;t fun or exciting gameplay.<br>
It does like 3000% more damage now though! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487124787219947520))<br>

Will a warrior have to commit to glad stance before a bg starts?<br>
In its current implementation, yes. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486692395853950978))<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br>
Is Rating -&gt; % conv. going to be the same for Crit and Multistrike? If so, it feels like Crit will always be numerically better.<br>
Nope. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/486578932733337600))<br>
Good to know. Are we going to see Multistrike Damage bonuses (&gt; 30%) the way we do with Crit? (&gt; 100/50%)<br>
Yes, but they&apos;re very rare. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/486580609829969921))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Is it realistic to expect we will frequently switch gemming and enchanting, esp given stat attunements?<br>
The average player? Maybe not. A top 10 guild tank doing progression? Wouldn&apos;t surprise me at all. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/486553679156109312))<br>
<br>
With most ench/gem/reforg gone, how do we promote build diversity aside for drop RnG. It&apos;s fairly important during progression.<br>
But enchanting and gemming aren&apos;t gone? Also flask/food is a good chunk of secondary stats - you can make large stat adjustments. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/486547707033432064))<br>
I was under the (misguided maybe?) impression that available enchants and gem slots are severely reduced in WoD?<br>
They&apos;re consolidated into fewer slots, so you can wear more gear instantly, but each enchant you do have is more impactful. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/486554000611753985))<br>
<br>
In other words, will heroic dungeon gear be powerful enough for normal mode Highmaul?<br>
Absolutely. Normal Highmaul is tuned for Heroic dungeon blues, and Normal Highmaul will be open before LFR. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/487307632336568322))<br>
Question, is that Normal which is &quot;Flex&quot; now, or &quot;Normal&quot; right now?<br>
If I ever talk about Warlords raids, I&apos;m using the 6.0 difficulty names. So, the former. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/487348672955285505))<br>
Follow-up inquiry, what is Heroic Highmaul tuned for?<br>
&quot;Tuned for&quot; can be misleading. Tuned to be done in Normal Highmaul gear by the audience for which Heroic is the likely endpoint. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/487353582153256960))<br>
But Mythic-caliber raiders should be quite able to do Heroic Highmaul without much/any Normal gear. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/487353794821246977))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Any chance at getting a few more bgs for low levels, random bgs xp &lt;3<br>
Actually yes! We are going to redistribute when battlegrounds come available. More at lower level. Also Random BG at level 20. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486708244673355776))<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t play much. I did however start at release and saw the game wither away since Cata.<br>
Arena participation grew 50% over the course if the expansion. Not dead, growing. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486510623522447360))<br>
<br>
constant new rewards take resources. motivation at top end is a recognition issue, maybe in game ladder UI to show off?<br>
Definitely thinking about ways to improve rewards and progression in PvP. Any change would need to be clearly better. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486539455558213634))<br>
<br>
we going to see an different version of nagrand arena in WoD? Maybe more #savage<br>
One of our longterm goals is to improve the visuals of the arenas while preserving their layouts. More to come on that. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486618427243511808))<br>
awesome, looking forward to see what is to come. Cant wait testing out Ashran when its on beta, druid ready to explore n kill! <br>
We&apos;re working to get Ashran playable in Beta very soon. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486619350787297282))<br>
<br>
then what about shooting through a hill in a bg map? Is that latency to?<br>
No terrain does not break LoS in WoW. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486679086027124736))<br>
<br>
so do you think they will ever make an arena that is wide open? Nowhere to hide type arena<br>
No, line of sight and positioning are a critical part of arena PvP (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486514428557275138))<br>
of unless you are a caster or hunter who can shoot through solid objects. Which has been a problem for years<br>
In arena? Barring latency, the objects in arena do block line of sight. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486677424709464065))<br>
so all the complaints about shooting through solid objects is being blamed on latency.<br>
do you have any specific examples? Generally, objects in arena break LoS. But for moving targets, latency matters. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486678785438146561))<br>
for instance, on my client, I may see myself behind the pillar, but on your client I haven&apos;t made it there yet. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486678894502633473))<br>
is that something that is trying to be fixed in WOD?<br>
No because it&apos;s the nature of online multiplayers games. Synchronization is often sacrificed for responsiveness. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486682572747845632))<br>
<br>
I remember you asking how to increase arena participation a while back. *hint*hint*<br>
We are creating new Vicious mounts of the Combatant achievements. It was very effective for increasing participation. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486679600164896768))<br>
<br>
I remember seeing something about the window for getting the vicious saddle being extended. True or am I just imagining things?<br>
The vicious saddle will be available each season. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486676717855981568))<br>
The same one available for s14 is still obtainable now then? Just trying to be sure to clear up confusion between friends and I<br>
You can obtain one Vicious Saddle per character each season. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486677271650902016))<br>
<br>
Well you can&apos;t really blame people. I don&apos;t give a crap about store mounts, but your answer was kinda poor and now deleted<br>
The irony is that we&apos;re already making more PvP mounts. I know people are upset, but we are doing what they want. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486581329257955328))<br>
1 Ground mount per expansion isn&apos;t what people want. Again you presume to thin you know what we want.<br>
who said one per expac was the plan? I think you are making assumptions. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486965201506287617))<br>
Sorry, it&apos;s actually two. For each faction. That&apos;s what we got for MoP. Did the plan change for WoD?<br>
We hope to do 2 per season as long as we can. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486983058914955265))<br>
<br>
Lore<br>
So Dave, outside Pandaria are there any beings to compare the celestials to? Or are they unique?<br>
The ancients (Goldrinn, Aviana, etc) are just like Celestials. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/486725641375469568))<br>
<br>
WHOA! The elements on Draenor want balance? They aren&apos;t fighting with early h other or mortals for supremacy?<br>
Unlike Azeroth, they don&apos;t seek the end to all, but the balance of all elements. The Breakers have other plans... (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487127217265442816))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
are there any negative ramifications for bulldozing your plots?<br>
There is a cost in garrison supplies, but there are also a ton of ways to obtain them (mostly through adventuring!) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/486391208621928449))<br>
<br>
Why the cut to only 3 small garrison plots? Forces picks for the player now, Storehouse or Salvage only choice.<br>
What would you have done with 4, specifically? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/486692681116958720))<br>
I&apos;m afraid of losing that impressive base feel, that houses a true army. Less complete base now.<br>
It&apos;s still REALLY big, and full of stuff. Looking forward to feedback when t3 unlocks for sure. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487121503902003201))<br>
<br>
Yep, more alts with Garrisons...<br>
Fine line to walk, rewards per alt. Didn&apos;t work out well on the farm. Check out garrison capacity system. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487123825176625152))<br>
<br>
What type of armor will non-human and orcs have? People are nervous around Worgen in Stormwind plate.<br>
They come in the armor of their origins, Night Elf sentinels will look like sentinels, etc. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487051828266164224))<br>
<br>
Can we have a variety of racial guards? Not just one race, but a combination of orcs, trolls, etc?<br>
There are some plans to allow you to customize where your guards come from (e.g. what main city) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487009561329401858))<br>
You mean faction right? Cause there are races without cities.<br>
Yes. You can have all worgen guards and call it Dogfort. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487017272725106688))<br>
Please say Pandaren will be included in this.<br>
Yup! Even some Shado-pan may choose to show up... (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487051981563781121))<br>
<br>
UI / Addons<br>
you said earlier no &quot;new stuff for arena frames&quot; - not even letting us scale/move them? Or do we have to rely on scripts?<br>
Those frames are reusing the boss frames. We&apos;d prefer to do a more comprehensive overhaul. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486686106990034944))<br>
Is it actually on the list, or something you&apos;d simply like to do?<br>
On the list of things we&apos;d like to do... (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486700418173382657))<br>
