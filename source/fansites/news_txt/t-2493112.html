Tauren Heritage Armor Unlock Clarification<br>
Hey all, so I have a 120 Tauren who is Exalted with Thunder Bluff. Thing is, he is an alt, so he has almost no quest-line progression through BFA. My question is, do I need to do the War-Campaign to a certain point with him to be able to unlock the new set? I don&#x2019;t really want to do it again, but if I have to do it to unlock the set I will&#x2026;I can&#x2019;t seem to find a definitive answer on this. Any ideas?<br>
You can use your main character to finish the Campaign questline, and then switch over to your Tauren and start the Heritage Armor questline.<br>

Arena Patch Note Clarification<br>
Arena<br>
<br>
Players now must always cast escape abilities before leaving combat (e.g. Vanish and Shadowmeld).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
How in the world is this listed under bug fixes? As if arenas since TBC should never have allowed people to get out of combat?? This is a major change and should be listed at the top of PvP changes with developer reasoning. This is a major deal and completely changes the meta of many comps in 2v2 and 3v3. Please can we get a post discussing this change? This is quite clearly being snuck in as a bug fix rofl.<br>
We&#x2019;re updating this note. It will now read:<br>
<br>
Fixed a bug that could cause players who were actively participating in PvP combat to unintentionally drop combat.</div></div>
