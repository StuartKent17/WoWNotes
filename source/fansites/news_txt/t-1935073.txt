1/13 Alpha Build Design Notes
There’s a new Alpha build today, which includes a number of new additions and changes. We’d like to provide some additional context and info, and also focus discussion on the topics that will provide the most useful feedback at the moment.


Tank and Healer Abilities and Cooldowns - Tanks and Healers will notice significant changes to the tuning on many of their defensive abilities. These may appear to be “nerfs” at first glance, but are actually part of a widespread adjustment to improve overall tank and tank healer gameplay, that includes reducing the strength/frequency of defensive cooldowns, and adjusting creature tuning to compensate. We’ve made a separate thread to give full context about these changes here: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20420493025
New Logging Feature - The Advanced Combat Log now includes additional data that will be of use to developers and users of data analysis sites and tools. We’ve made a separate thread to provide the data structure for the new COMBATANT_INFO log event here: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20419432775
New Specializations Unlocked – There are 7 new specializations ready for testing! Several additional specializations have been unlocked for testing. We’d love any and all feedback about their gameplay, artifact quest lines, abilities, etc.

Vengeance Demon Hunter – NOTE: Vengeance abilities, talents, and artifact traits are still preliminary and are being heavily iterated on.
Guardian Druid
Restoration Druid
Marksmanship Hunter
Discipline Priest
Enhancement Shaman
Elemental Shaman

Honorable Medallion – This build includes our solution for the “CC break trinket” for low level classes. Upon entering a battleground or arena for the first time, players will learn the “Honorable Medallion” temp name spell. This spell removes all movement impairing effects and all effects which cause loss of control of your character while in PvP combat and has a 3 minute cooldown. Players can learn this spell at any level and it resides in the General section of your spell book. The first row of PvP talents then modifies the Honorable Medallion. This will provide the “CC break trinket” mechanic for all levels of PvP player. Feedback on this solution would be appreciated!
Talent Design Status - We’ve reached a ‘first draft’ level of design for talents for all specializations. There are some that we still have outstanding plans to revise or replace, but the vast majority are ready for feedback. Tuning has not been done, so you’ll have to imagine that numbers are adjusted such that talents are balanced, but we’d love to hear feedback about what talents you like or dislike. Especially useful is feedback on particular talent rows, and whether they feel like interesting choices or not again, assuming numbers will be balanced.
Artifact Trait Design Status - More artifacts are available, and you’ll be able to unlock further traits on existing artifacts. At this time, feedback is welcome on artifact traits, but we still have much work to do on them, and have many revisions planned. Expect significant change to many of the artifact traits in the future.


Thanks, and we look forward to your feedback!


Tank & Healer Ability Tuning
In the latest Legion Alpha build, tanks and healers will notice significant changes to the tuning on many of their defensive abilities. These may appear to be “nerfs” at first glance, but are actually part of a widespread adjustment to improve overall tank and tank healer gameplay, that includes reducing the strength/frequency of defensive cooldowns, and adjusting creature tuning to compensate.

Over the course of Warlords of Draenor, tanks have been mostly self-sufficient, providing the vast majority of their own survival, with only minor direct assistance required from healers. Encounter design has unfortunately reinforced this, focusing tank damage into more and more bursty moments in an attempt to challenge tanks. This has made long-cooldown defensive ability usage more and more important, while also further trivializing direct healing requirements.

For Legion, we want to return the overall tank gameplay to a more stable environment. In that, we have laid out some specific goals that we aim to hit:


Tanks will require more direct healing. This will also improve on healer gameplay, as it’s more engaging when there’s a mixture of the types of healing that need to be used on any single encounter.
Active Mitigation abilities for tanks such as Shield Block or Death Strike should feel rewarding, allowing an experienced tank to meaningfully reduce damage taken.
Healers should care about the time and mana required to heal tanks, so that taking less damage as a tank is considered valuable. 
Tanks and healers’ long-cooldown defensive abilities such as Barkskin or Shield Wall should feel like a valuable resource. These abilities should be strong, but not necessarily available for every danger during a specific encounter.
Tanks should have much more survivability than a non-tank. However, they don’t necessarily need to be extremely more sturdy. If the difference in ‘tankiness’ between tanks and non-tanks becomes too much of a gap, we then risk having situations such that if any one add gets loose, it’s likely to instantly kill any poor healer or damage dealer they hit–as the damage that these creatures deal would need to be exponentially higher to offset the sturdiness of the tank. This also brings a risk that tanks would opt to ignore enemy abilities that are designed to be dangerous to non-tanks, just taking those relatively minor blows rather than trying to avoid them as intended.
In raid encounters, tanks should spend more time tanking, and less time waiting for their turn to tank.
Tanks should be able to handle solo content quite effectively. They need to do less damage than dedicated damage dealers, but that difference can be moderate. It doesn’t have to be a massive difference.


Looking at these goals, we’ve made the following changes for tanking in Legion. We hope that these explanations will help you understand the bigger picture, in that these should be viewed as an overall improvement to the style of tank gameplay, rather than nerfs.


In order to ensure that tanks require direct healing from healers, we’re increasing the amount of damage that makes it past a tank’s mitigation. This will include reducing or removing passive defensive abilities, along with the below changes.
We’re toning down how frequently you’re able to use Active Mitigation abilities. This change will generally affect the length of their cooldowns, and not necessarily the strength of the ability. We believe these abilities are important to tank survival; but, when the uptime on these abilities gets too high, skill in knowing when to use them strategically matters less.
There are many long-cooldown defensive abilities that will be able to be used less frequently, and, in some cases, these abilities may be weaker. Many of these abilities are currently either too numerous or usable too frequently, resulting in a strong cooldown for almost every threatening moment of every encounter.
Encounter design will be adjusted to account for these changes. Overwhelming burst damage will be toned down, in favor of more steady and consistent damage on tanks.
The damage of creatures that are intended to be tanked in group content will be reduced overall, in order to ensure that tanks can still perform their role just as well as before.
Damage output by tanks will be increased, and their scaling with gear will be improved. This is being done so that tanks can stay in-line with damage dealers as a group gears up together.


Please note that many of these changes are preliminary, and we’ll be tweaking our changes based on testing and feedback. We’ll continue making adjustments as the Alpha moves along, until classes are in a more balanced state, and we look forward to hearing your thoughts throughout this process.

For more info on the latest Legion Alpha changes, see our summary thread: Will edit in a moment!


New Logging Feature: COMBATANT_INFO
Today’s Alpha build includes a new logging feature when Advanced Combat Log is turned on. Whenever an ENCOUNTER_START event occurs, a new “COMBATANT_INFO” log line will also be printed for each player in the instance. The current data structure for COMBATANT_INFO is as follows, but is subject to change based on feedback and technical needs:

COMBATANT_INFO,playerGUID,Strength,Agility,Stamina,Intelligence,Dodge,Parry,Block,CritMele e,CritRanged,CritSpell,Speed,Lifesteal,HasteMelee,HasteRanged,HasteSpell,Avoidance,Mastery ,VersatilityDamageDone,VersatilityHealingDone,VersatilityDamageTaken,CurrentSpecID,Class Talent 1, ...,PvP Talent 1, ...,[Artifact Trait ID 1, Trait Effective Level 1, ...],[Equipped Item ID 1,Equipped Item iLvL 1,Permanent Enchant ID, Temp Enchant ID, On Use Spell Enchant ID,Gem ID 1, Gem iLvL 1, ... ...],[Interesting Aura Caster GUID 1, Interesting Aura Spell ID 1, ...]

Some clarifications about a few of those elements:

Stats – Those are the current stat values at the time of the log line. Secondary stats are in terms of the Rating amount, not a %.
Talents – A list of the selected talents. Today’s build will print this ID as a TalentID, a record type that is not dataminable. This will be fixed in a future build to be the SpellID of the talent.
Artifact Traits – This will be a list of the selected traits for the character’s current specialization’s artifact even if it’s not equipped. The Artifact Trait ID is an ID to a new record type to 7.0, which should be dataminable already. Trait Effective Level is the number of points placed in that talent. Note that some Relics will allow this to go beyond the max.
Equipment – This is a list of all equipped gear on the character. The first ID is the standard Item ID of the item, followed by its ilvl. After that is a list of enchants on the item, one of each of the 3 possible enchantment types using the ItemEnchantment ID.
Interesting Auras – This is a list of interesting auras buffs/debuffs that we have manually flagged to be included in this log line. We’ll welcome feedback about what should be included here but currently plan for set bonuses, well fed, flasks, combat potions, and Vantus runes. Nothing has been flagged for this yet, so you won’t see anything here in the current build.


The easiest way to test this is likely via dungeon bosses. Give it a try, and let us know how it works for you, whether there’s any key information that you think is missing, what other interesting auras you’d like to see, etc. There are certainly technical limitations involved here, so we may not be able to fill every request, but we’ll do what we can! Thanks!


The Legion Alpha Test Is Back
Our gnomish engineers have returned from their adorable little Winter Veil vacation to bring the Legion alpha test back online—and they’ve made a few updates in the process!

In addition to all of the content that was previously included in the alpha, testers can now explore the new Val’Sharah zone and delve into the new Darkheart Thicket dungeon. The Shaman Order Hall is also now available, and the new Demon Hunter Vengeance tank spec is ready for testing. The raid boss Ursoc has also made an appearance . . . and he can bearly wait to meet you. Character copy is currently disabled, but testers can create high-level characters using templates we’ve provided.

As a reminder, there’s no NDA non-disclosure agreement for the Legion alpha test, so participants are free to stream the game and share screenshots or movies. Please keep in mind that Legion is still in development—we’ll be making changes as we continue to prepare for the upcoming beta test, and what you’ll see during the alpha test is not necessarily representative of the final game.

Players selected to participate in the alpha test will receive an email invitation directing them to download and install the alpha client directly through Battle.net desktop app. As always, please be aware of phishing attempts—if you’re unsure whether your invitation is legitimate, please log in to Battle.net to verify whether you can install and play the Legion alpha.

Getting Started
1.If you’ve been selected to participate in the Legion alpha, your Battle.net account will already be flagged for access.
2.Make sure your graphics drivers are up to date.
3.Run the Battle.net desktop app—it may need to update itself if you haven’t run it recently. If you don’t have it installed, get started here http://us.battle.net/en/app/.
4.Once Battle.net is installed and updated, select World of Warcraft from the list of games on the left.
5.In the Region/Account drop-down menu above the Play button, choose Alpha: Legion listed under In Development, then click Install.
6.Allow installation to complete, and click Play.
Once you’ve launched the game, use the Legion alpha template to create a character. This is located near the Enter World button.

Providing Feedback
We’d love to hear about your experiences on the Broken Isles, so once you’ve had a chance to play, please send us your feedback.

For general feedback, use the in-game Feedback interface.
For crashes, please use the Crash Reporter feature that appears when the client crashes.
For general game bugs, use the in-game Bug Report interface.
If you’re getting a wrong version error, please uninstall and reinstall the client.
Discuss the alpha with your fellow testers in our Legion alpha General Discussion http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/21882800/ and Bug Report http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/21882799/ forums.


How do I opt in?
Once you’ve set up a Battle.net account and have attached at least one Blizzard game, you can choose to opt in to future beta tests from the Beta Profile https://eu.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html page—just check the box next to which games you’re interested in testing. Once that’s complete, it’s simply a matter of waiting for an invitation.
