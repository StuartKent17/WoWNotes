As promised, here is another batch of WotLK updates and almost on time !. All the pages for 5-man dungeons had their summary greatly improved :

Loot tables have been added. Screenshots for each items are available as well as links to the major item databases. Tooltips on mouseover have been added. Items are now sorted by type and spec.
Quests have been added
Achievements have been added

The individual pages for each boss aren't done yet and will most likely be ready for tomorrow, along with ... What you're all waiting for. Yes, raid instances, but listing 150 items in a same instance take slightly more time than 5-man dungeons

Also, you can contribute to the next update by : 

Pointing out errors, dead links, or anything useful.
Posting missing strategies in comments, it's not like 5-man bosses are very hard and that's probably easy to explain
Post decent videos for each encounter if you have them ... Just make sure the quality isn't too bad
You can also mail me your screenshots if they're very nice. 1440x900 min resolution, very high details settings, no interface

The last one is just here for polishing but I guess it doesn't hurt to ask. And now ... the updated pages !
