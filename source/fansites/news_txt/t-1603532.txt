Tank Squish Changes
So basically you're saying that after this change that you just spoke of...

1. We will self-heal a lot more in solo/out of combat so that Ret isn't more survivable than Prot and it ain't taking us 60+ seconds to heal up after combat
2. We will self-heal about the same during raid content so tanks aren't overpowered like in MoP

Is that about right?
Yes.

Any thoughts on Resolve's scaling at high levels of damage taken? As of right now, we're getting pretty absurd levels of it in raid situations; even the mythic tank dummy with no stacks takes us about 80-85% of the way to the hard cap on our healing. I don't agree with the folks that say to make it linear since there needs to be something to account for our better gear scaling this expansion, but even I think that Resolve's scaling is pitiful at high levels of damage taken.
Vengeance was a huge additive increase on a trivial base amount.

Resolve is a multiplier on a very significant base amount that grows with gear. As your gear improves, that multiplier needs to grow slower in order to produce the same effect. Your gear improving will make those smaller increases in Resolve more meaningful.

Proving Grounds
get silver, but then get 430 heroics gear first? or if geared enough for heroics geared enough 4 gold?
It's the same for all difficulties. You want ilvl 615 for max effectiveness at level 100 Normal dungeon gear. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/517024908853772288

PvE
a question: lately i've heard that soo mythic will be cross-realm. Does that mean WoD's mythic will be so?
New Mythic tiers will not be cross-realm; that restriction will be removed after some time, likely when the next tier arrives. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/516813548446826496

...isn't Mythic aimed for 5 and rarely 4 or 6? I think mentioned something like that earlier this year.
Yes, we view 5 as the target. We'll likely bump the raid damage on several fights that were being widely 4-healed. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/516986787193819136

PvP
hey I had seen the ranked arena games are ending when 6.0.2 goes live does this mean conquest gear will be available for honor?
Yes holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/516041874344116224

Hey, whats happening to Duels resetting cooldowns? Was very excited for this, but hasn't been working for as long as I've had beta
It won't be ready for Warlords release. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/516694248989552640

you snuck resilience into the latest build under the name "player damage reduction level 100"?
It's a bit inside baseball but we may need baseline resil at lower levels and we need that buff to remove it at higher levels. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/516972593560453122
still no plans for resilience at level 100. Damage pacing feels right for the most part. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/516972806366830592

Will Skirmishes be available in 6.0?
yes holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517006999595544577

will players be able to earn honor/anything else from skirmishes in 6.0.2?
yes honor holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517017291020853250

Dont think it'd be a good experience for people who want to pracctice
Playing skirmishes to practice for arena is analogous to playing random bgs to practice rated bgs. Not recommended holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517019038430801920
you will have a hidden MMR but high end players should not expect as high level play as rated holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517019509086257152

Lore
Are we going to see the Mantid again? There were a million things you guys did right with em, I couldn't list them all on twitter
They're pretty local to Pandaria. I doubt you'll see much of them anywhere else, but you never know. They can fly, after all. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/516778051469066241

How is Khadgar "tirion esque" you mean Cata thrall esque? because he's an alliance character.
He's leading a coalition of Alliance and Horde forces on Draenor. So, pretty much exactly what Tirion did in Wrath. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517055094248861696
Or rather, he's trying to get them to cooperate against the Iron Horde. Both factions interact with him to some degree. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517055719627956225

World
Not sure if you're the right person to ask this but is Timeless Isle sticking around going into #Warlords?
Yep, it's not going anywhere. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/516252025982840832
and it isn't changing? so for instance I can go do all the stuff I never did in MoP in WoD!
Other than some specific things like the legendary questline, everything from Mists will remain for you to explore. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/516253721098211328

Garrisons
If you change your garrison outpost , you'll get a new questline with a new follower, right?
No, we didn't want you to have to "collect them all" by systematically replacing each outpost. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/516623617812348928

Misc
Yay! Another Blizz representative that's horde ...and you guys still try to deny the bias, pffft!
Actually, the WoW dev team has a pretty even split of Horde and Alliance players. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517024689131360258


Poll - Garrison Art
We have looked at a decent number of the garrison buildings now, so which faction's art do you prefer?
