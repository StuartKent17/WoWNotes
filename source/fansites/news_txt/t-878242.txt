The Patch 4.1 Public Test Realm Notes http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/160430/patch-41-public-test-realm-notes-march-30 have been updated once again and contain a lot of interesting changes! 



Many "Account Bound" heirlooms are now labeled as "Battle.net Account Bound". See the notes for more info
A couple of classes changes from the past 2 PTR builds
A lot of 5-man dungeons changes
The rate at which Honor Points are earned has been doubled.

Achievements
PvP

The following Battleground achievements have been permanently removed from the game, as they do not function correctly with the achievement tracking system:

Guild Gankin' in Gilneas
Guild Gulch
The Peak of Perfection
The Perfect Guild Storm
Storming the Beach



Achievements Bug Fixes

The guild achievements for earning exalted reputation with factions Ambassador, Diplomacy, and United Nations have been fixed to now correctly count cumulative guild members with exalted factions. Previously, these achievements would only count exalted factions on one guild member.
The guild rated Battleground title achievements should now properly be awarded.


Items
Account Bound Items

Many "Account Bound" heirlooms are now labeled as "Battle.net Account Bound", meaning that they can also be traded or mailed to characters that are on different World of Warcraft accounts under the same Battle.net account.
Mail sent to characters on the same Battle.net account now arrives instantaneously, as it does for the same World of Warcraft account.
Mailing account-bound items to characters of the opposite faction on the same Battle.net account will now correctly translate faction-specific items to their appropriate equivalent.

Guilds

Guild Challenges are now available for testing.

These challenges can be found in the Info pane of the guild UI.
Guild Challenges fall into three categories: Guild Dungeon Run, Guild Raid, and Guild Rated Battleground.
Each challenge can be completed a set number of times per week. Guild groups participating in level-appropriate Heroic or normal difficulty dungeons and raids, or Rated Battlegrounds, will automatically qualify for challenge credit.
Each time a Guild Challenge is completed, the guild will be awarded experience and gold deposited directly into the Guild Vault, as well as the opportunity to earn all-new achievements. A popup or “toast” will be displayed to confirm a Guild Challenge has been completed similar to achievement alerts.
Guild experience earned via Guild Challenges will be awarded above the daily cap. The experience cap will move forward relative to the amount of experience obtained through completing Guild Challenges similar to rested experience for characters.
Guilds already at the level cap will be awarded substantially more gold in place of guild experience.
Gold rewards require the qualified guild members of the group to be honored with their guild, and the guild must be level 5.
