Legion - System Requirements
New system requirements were recently posted and we took a look at how they compare to the old ones. <span title="to do laps around Dalaran">If you are ready to upgrade</span>, you can take a look at our latest Setup of the Month http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5472-Legion-Resto-Druid-Artifact-Intro-Achievement-Search-Tweets-Setup-of-the-Month or ask for assistance on the Computer Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/290-Computer. 

Mac requirements are listed on the Legion https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-legion and Warlords https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/300493 system requirement pages. Notable increases include the minimum CPU going from a Core2 Duo to i5-750, as well as the minimum 2GB to 4GB and recommended 4GB to 8GB RAM being increased. 

Minimum

Intel CPU: Intel Core2 Duo E6600 increased to Intel Core2 Duo E8500
AMD CPU: AMD Phenom X3 8750 increased to AMD Phenom II X3 720

The system requirements for Legion are much higher than the requirements for Warlords of Draenor. Make sure your computer meets these requirements before purchasing the Legion expansion.


Warlords of Draenor - All Character Achievements Complete
Players are keeping busy while waiting for Legion, with several players completing all of the possible character achievements. Congratulations to Arpexia of Thrall-EU http://www.wowprogress.com/character/eu/thrall/Arpexia and the others that followed.

Blue Tweets
Is the 5.3 bickering between the Alliance PC and Vol'jin canon? It seems OOC of Vol'jin to threaten in the manner that he did.
Definitely canon. And besides, Alliance players who called his bluff when he threatened could make him back down. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/697652193592102916

.I can repeat the Bodhi Pet Battle world quest over and over on same toon. Received rewards every time. Intended?? #LegionAlpha
it's a bug, new tech not quite ready to unleash PB quests officially, but feel free to give feedback as you find them! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/697833959342764033


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
I still have not forgiven you for that article and never will! You slapped a lot of players in the face!
I explained our intent that you coordinate with a team and don't just AE everything. I've never quite understood that controversy OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694902946895495168
Maybe it was the title? I wanted to echo the surprise players likely after LK's dungeon zergs but maybe it sounded patronizing? OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694903212499800065

I strongly disliked the logic that "players can't do this". The drive to improve has steadily been quashed.
For me games are about overcoming obstacles, whether it's Dark Souls, League or the Witness. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694904390960852992
I enjoy walking my dogs in the morning, but I'm really not looking for a challenge there. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694904111964106752
I believe players *can* do something, but I think for many they maybe weren't looking for that in a game. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694903912403333120
But maybe some players want the equivalent of the dog walk, at least sometimes? OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694904520187334656
