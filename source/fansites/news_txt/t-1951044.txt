Legion - System Requirements
New system requirements were recently posted and we took a look at how they compare to the old ones. <span title="to do laps around Dalaran">If you are ready to upgrade</span>, you can take a look at our latest Setup of the Month  or ask for assistance on the Computer Forums  

Mac requirements are listed on the Legion  and Warlords  system requirement pages. Notable increases include the minimum CPU going from a Core2 Duo to i5-750, as well as the minimum 2GB to 4GB and recommended 4GB to 8GB RAM being increased. 

Minimum

Intel CPU: Intel Core2 Duo E6600 increased to Intel Core2 Duo E8500
AMD CPU: AMD Phenom X3 8750 increased to AMD Phenom II X3 720
Drive Space: 35 GB increased to 45 GB.
Nvidia GPU: 8800 GT increased to GT 440
AMD GPU: Radeon HD 4850 increased to Radeon HD 5670
Intel GPU: HD Graphics 3000 increased to HD Graphics 5000


Recommended

Operating System: Windows 7, 8, or 10 increased to Windows 10.
Intel CPU: Intel Core i5-2400 increased to Intel Core i5-3330
AMD CPU: AMD FX-4100 increased to AMD FX-6300
Nvidia GPU: GTX 470 increased to GTX 750 Ti
AMD GPU: Radeon HD 5870 increased to R7 260X


The system requirements for Legion are much higher than the requirements for Warlords of Draenor. Make sure your computer meets these requirements before purchasing the Legion expansion.


Warlords of Draenor - All Character Achievements Complete
Players are keeping busy while waiting for Legion, with several players completing all of the possible character achievements. Congratulations to Arpexia of Thrall-EU  and the others that followed.

Is the 5.3 bickering between the Alliance PC and Vol'jin canon? It seems OOC of Vol'jin to threaten in the manner that he did.
Definitely canon. And besides, Alliance players who called his bluff when he threatened could make him back down. DaveKosak 

.I can repeat the Bodhi Pet Battle world quest over and over on same toon. Received rewards every time. Intended?? #LegionAlpha
it's a bug, new tech not quite ready to unleash PB quests officially, but feel free to give feedback as you find them! Muffinus 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
I still have not forgiven you for that article and never will! You slapped a lot of players in the face!
I explained our intent that you coordinate with a team and don't just AE everything. I've never quite understood that controversy OccupyGStreet 
Maybe it was the title? I wanted to echo the surprise players likely after LK's dungeon zergs but maybe it sounded patronizing? OccupyGStreet 

I strongly disliked the logic that "players can't do this". The drive to improve has steadily been quashed.
For me games are about overcoming obstacles, whether it's Dark Souls, League or the Witness. OccupyGStreet 
I enjoy walking my dogs in the morning, but I'm really not looking for a challenge there. OccupyGStreet 
I believe players *can* do something, but I think for many they maybe weren't looking for that in a game. OccupyGStreet 
But maybe some players want the equivalent of the dog walk, at least sometimes? OccupyGStreet
