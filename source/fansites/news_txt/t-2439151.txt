Upcoming Azerite Armor Improvements
Why does it even need to be based on your item history to begin with? Why can't it just be based on your general item level like every other world quest and emissary gear reward?
That's what we mean by item history. It calculates your general item level as you put it based on all items you've looted, including items you may no longer have. This way if you loot an item that's a few item levels higher than what you have equipped, then decide you don't want it and vendor or disenchant it, you're still seeing higher item level rewards from world quests, emissaries, etc.
