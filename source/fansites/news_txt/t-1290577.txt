Patch 5.3 - The Secrets of Ragefire Scenario
Today we take a look at one of the shorter scenarios added in Patch 5.3, The Secrets of Ragefire. The Gob Squad has tracked the people that disappeared from Durotar to Ragefire Caverns, a supposedly abandoned section of Ragefire. After blowing open the door, you will find a large cavern filled with Kor'kron that are hostile. 

The first miniboss you fight is Dark Shaman Xorenth http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/70683-dark-shaman-xorenth, presumably related to the low level friendly quest NPC Invoker Xorenth http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/61716-invoker-xorenth. The Gob Squad warns him that Goblins are not his enemy, and he responds by calling them a lesser race. 

After disposing of Xorenth, you look through piles of things around the cavern, such as discarded artifacts from the digsite in Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Another set of crates contains Kor'kron weapons and supplies, with the text "From the look of things, Garrosh is planning an invasion". The third thing you come across is Proto-drake eggs, causing one of the goblins to suggest that Garrosh may be working with the Dragonmaw. 

Upon noticing a large door on the other side of the cavern, Ticker produces a Mantid bomb, which you collect parts to help and modify including a pony https://twitter.com/WoWDB/status/322035447922561024. Unfortunately the bomb has no effect on the door, only inuring the other members of the Gob Squad. More Kor'Kron attack while the remaining members of the Gob Squad build a teleporter to escape and tell Vol'jin what you have seen.

any ideas on making casters actually go oom aside from healers? Atm only spriests do. Mages stay full mana
Arcane can run OOM, which is by design. Other casters are not intended to. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325304959732174848

can you elaborate on the reason for the feral buffs? or point to somewhere they've been discussed
We thought their sustained DPS was a little low. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324706123884134400

No changes to resto Druids? like we do need some changes cant just forsake us because a new class for the same niche is out
We don't make changes to every spec for the sake of it. Many players focus way too much on number of patch notes per class. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324699783388344320
However, having said that, we did make some Resto druid changes just today. You'll see them soon. As ever, nothing is final in 5.3. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324700529257226241

the TeB change on MMO champ has left the entire monk community in confusion.. care to elaborate? nerf? buff? confused.

Holy Paladin T15 4pc is incredibly weak, a 20% bonus on something that makes up 5% of our healing? Offset pieces are better.

Any plans for holy priests 5.3 chakra rework maybe? if not any future plans? Would love to see some changes soon.
Not for 5.3. Long term we'd like to keep the idea of Chakra but make it easier to use and more fun. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325305975286407168

Are you really nerfing Smite by a flat 20% with the glyph change? It's already the weakest spell in Atonement by far... ugh.
Atonement is really overpowered. We're trying to nerf it without removing all of its fun. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324701558539427842

It might just be a tool-tip change. If not, why nerf the damage of Penance? Disc damage in PvP is already garbage.
We want to make sure healing someone with Penance heals more than Atonement DPS with Penance. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324701059618578435

As I read the 5.3 patch notes, once you activate Fire & Brimstone you have to exhaust your embers to turn it off. Correct?
It will auto turn off, but you can also click off the buff or just click the spell again to toggle it off. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325001406731927554

It's not. That would be more of a Heroic Hop. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325304008313028609

Why the change to Enraged Regen for Warriors? I'm not a fan of it myself.
Curious as to why. Overall, the feedback was that having to cache rage for an emergency button was hard to use. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325001631156539392

Character
You dislike the idea of account-wide gear. Is that why its taking so long for cross realm BoAs?
I dislike shifting lots of gear to be BoA. I like existing BoA gear being easy to transfer to all your characters. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324325203964461057

Well since you seem to like to deflect your failures in MoP, lets ask why everything in WoW is still BoP. Make stuff BoE.
There is a big risk there of making the AH the best way to gear. Another recent game had this problem. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325029719709999104
I'd love it if bop items that haven't been equipped could be mailed between chars and only locked if equipped
We dabble with that, but it ultimately means your hunter gets all geared up without you ever having to actually play them. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325037528862302210

Do you think that all players are able to play 12 hours a day to get a better gear ? I don't have so much time.
You can make progress at whatever rate you are comfortable playing. You just won't make the fastest progress. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324324955288387584

Could you explain why we can't use legendary meta in upgraded 504 helms? It seems a little silly.
The intent was always for Throne of Thunder helms. Apologies that we did not communicate that intent well. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324324200875712513

I have almost never tweeted. Please never allow this. No one will have anything but legendaries. Be more creative.
To devil's advocate, players might also get sick of them if everyone has them. The same happened to paly T2. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324215559107526657

Have you discussed maybe making thunderforged items not upgradeable? You could make non tfed gear turn into tfed after upgrade
The main goal with Tforged was to keep those earlier bosses still feel exciting. If Tforge was just Valor savings not sure. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324703170779570177

I have a reputation on my realm. community Thats useless in LFR. anti social concept
Agree that LFR is an anti-social concept. To be fair, that's not it's goal though and the benefits far outweigh that cost. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325037032722280448
But we realize we have some work to do to get the social elements back into the game. Cutting LFR just isn't among our options. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325037217351348224

wow needs a decent guildfinder tool. XRealm and Armory linked either through the website or in game or both
Yeah, we agree. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325335253436739584

community in wow has severely degraded with lfd/r. could they at least try to prioritize same realm groups?
They do. It's just a compromise to avoid players having excessively long queue times. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325307846449328129

Loot is a bonus to raiding. A community is a must have for an MMO. Otherwise we have only LFR/LFG, no guilds.
My personal conviction is you will have more fun playing WoW with friends. Solo LFR is for when that isn't feasible. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325037878222667776

There's currently a bug with rppm trinkets which let's you guarantee a proc on pull if you don't release after wipe, Fix inc?
You'll get a proc pretty quickly regardless - should be within seconds, just not necessarily the very first hit. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325305127219130369

PPM bad-streak protection, does it suggest a 5 min break between pulls is optimal? It promotes boring gameplay if so. 
If you are out of combat for even a minute, you should get the hit on one of your first few attacks. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325002466775154688
This is true for fast trinkets like the 3.3 RPPM Agi ones, but a UVLS user has to wait many minutes for the bonus.
Should only be true of your very first attack. It will still proc in the first few seconds. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325035091128614912

at the bmah i see a lot of brawler guild invites noone bids for. Is it probably not as successfull as you planned?
I think we're at the point where most players who wanted invites have them now. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325001122135810050
