Armory Updates
The US http://www.wowarmory.com Armory has been updated to reflect the additions and changes of Arena Season 3. Here is a rundown of the new content.
New Personal Arena Ratings appear in Character and Team Profiles. A given character can have up to three Personal Arena Ratings at one time – one for each team type. Personal ratings are used as the new basis of eligibility for certain Arena rewards Season 3 shoulders and weapons, and end-of-season prizes such as special titles.
The full set of Season 3 Arena rewards, consisting of the Vengeful Gladiator armor sets and weapons, are now in the Item Database.
The full set of Vindicator’s honor rewards are now in the Item Database. These epic rewards are purchased with honor points and battleground Marks of Honor.
The special Season 2 titles awarded to the top tier Arena teams should appear in Character Profiles if selected in-game.
Season 2’s Hall of Fame: This archive commemorating the top teams of Season 2 should appear on the Armory soon.

WoW translated in Russian soon ?
Nothing is official yet, but the announcement is probably close. A few weeks ago Blizzard started posting offers for jobs of russian localization on their European Job Application site http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/. For the moment the jobs available are :
Localization/QA Lead, Russian http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/loc-russianloclead.shtml
QA/Game Tester, Russian http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/loc-russiangametester.shtml
Translator, Russian http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/loc-russiantranslator.shtml
Community Representative, Russian http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/com-russiancomrepresentative.shtml
Lead Game Master, Russian http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/cs-russianleadgamemaster.shtml
Customer and Billing Support, Russian http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/cs-russianbillingsupport.shtml
Customer and Technical Support, Russian http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/cs-russiantechsupport.shtml
Web Editorialist, Russian http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/web-russianeditorialist.shtml



This definitely look like a full ingame / out of game team is getting ready. Of course there are a lot more languages on the teaser page http://teaser.wow-europe.com/index_ru.html than the ones currently available in game danish, italian, swedish, etc ... but this is the only one getting a dev team.

Again, nothing is official yet but if they do plan to launch WoW in Russia it will probably happen soon. Before the expansion ?
