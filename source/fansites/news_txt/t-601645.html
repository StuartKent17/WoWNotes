<br>
Hopefully, I had a PvP site project scheduled, and I threatened enough people to have it online for the Blizzcon. There will probably be a few bugs but this should be enough to cover the world finals. (Feel free to report anything on the PvPScene.com (http://www.pvpscene.com) forums)<br>
<br>
On the long run, you&apos;ll find results of all WoW PvP competitions here, and enough articles to keep you busy when there isn&apos;t anything to cover. (Note that PapaShlapa from World Of Papa (http://worldofpapa.blogspot.com/) will be writing here now, keeping his blog for infos about the team and a few other things)<br>
