Battle.Net Beta Profile Images Updated<br>
It seems the Battle.Net Beta Profile (https://us.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html) has been updated with new images to reflect the upcoming Diablo 3 and WoW Expansions. The previous art was Mists of Pandaria themed, but now appears to be an image of Thrall, similar to the banners (http://i.imgur.com/Kbxrf5b.jpg) being put up at the convention center.<br>
