General<br>
<br>
Shifting in-and-out of Cat Form should now correctly reapply Cat Form&apos;s speed bonus while Dash or Stampeding Roar is active.<br>
Fixed an issue where various item effects that provides a buff based on the player&apos;s highest stat sometimes picked the wrong stat for Balance and Restoration Druids that were shapeshifted into Bear Form or Cat Form.<br>

<br>
General<br>
<br>
Tiger Strikes should no longer incorrectly activate on unsuccessful autoattacks, but will be able to activate from successful Multistrikes. Fixing this will result in an overall damage gain for all Monks, so there are a couple of additional adjustments (see below). Additionally, Tiger Strikes should now correctly provide the full 10% chance to trigger for Mistweavers in Crane Stance while equipping one-handed items in conjunction with off-hand items. For more details of this change, please visit the forum thread: Upcoming Tiger Strikes Hotfix.<br>
<br>
Keg Smash (Brewmaster) now deals 20% less damage.<br>
Rising Sun Kick (Windwalker, Mistweaver) now causes enemies to take 20% increased damage from the Monk&apos;s abilities (up from 10%).<br>
The tooltip for Tiger Strikes is incorrectly stating that the chance for it to activate is 6.25% while dual-wielding. The actual chance is 5% (and has been since Warlords of Draenor released). The tooltip will be corrected in a future patch.<br>
<br>
<br>
Talents<br>
<br>
Fixed an issue with Chi Torpedo that caused it to deal no damage unless the Glyph of Water Roll was applied.<br>

Patch 6.1 - Ashran Changes<br>
We understand there is a lot of confusion about the removal of conquest points from Grand Marshal Tremblade and High Warlord Volrath, so we&#x2019;d like to explain the reasoning behind it. <br>
<br>
Our primary goal with Ashran was to create a zone where two factions were competing against each other throughout the zone. The average visitor in Ashran has two motivations: earn 200 conquest to fulfill the Ashran bonus portion of their conquest cap, and kill the faction boss for their daily chance at loot from the Gleaming Ashmaul Strongbox. Prior to 6.1, players could earn that conquest by either killing the faction boss or by doing events. We were allowing the same reward to be earned at two different places at the same time.<br>
<br>
This setup does not encourage competition. It encourages collusion. As a result, an implicit truce had emerged between the factions, where the Alliance claimed victory in the Road of Glory while Horde wandered the event areas unopposed for conquest. Both sides earned their reward in an efficient manner without any fighting. But Ashran is not a place for truces. Ashran is a place for killing. We removed conquest from the bosses knowing full well this meant the Alliance would be forced to compete against the Horde in events for conquest. Furthermore, we knew that facing new opposition at events, the Horde would once again engage in the central road. <br>
<br>
Of course, we acknowledge that killing a faction boss only to receive Aspirant gear isn&#x2019;t very motivating. As a result, we&#x2019;ll be removing Aspirant gear from the Gleaming Ashmaul Strongbox. That means it will always award either Combatant (ilevel 620/675) or Gladiator (ilevel 660/690) gear.<br>
<br>
We are already seeing increased competition between the two factions in both events and the main road. In every Ashran instance, the population of both factions is tightly controlled to maintain equal numbers. Your faction has the opportunity to compete, but it is up to you to earn victory. Good luck and have fun! <br>
<br>
<br>

Ashran<br>
So there&apos;s no reason to attack the enemy general anymore.<br>
A lot of people would still like to collect Combatant and Gladiator gear. It&apos;s decent.<br>
<br>
Why? For what reason is that important now?<br>
It might not be important for you at this stage. And that&apos;s okay. You might be one of the people who should be focusing more on winning the events over the Horde for the Conquest Points.<br>
<br>
I guess that&apos;s why the que times are down, nobody wants to go in there anymore!<br>
There were fairly notable changes in 6.1 to how Ashran instances are populated, the goal being to reduce the unacceptable wait times.<br>
<br>
But what about the people who have no need for Honor or Conquest points? Are we expected to avoid Ashran now to simply do arenas or rated bgs? Why should I, who have full conq gear, take another step into Ashran?<br>
Perhaps it depends on whether you enjoy the experience you&apos;re having there. Ultimately that&apos;s important.<br>
<br>
Hey Zarhym.... Heres a novel idea for your fail ashran pvp.<br>
Stopped reading right at the end of your first sentence. <br>
<br>
A lot of people in this community have opinions to share. You might consider whether your approach to sharing yours is in the least bit palatable.<br>
<br>
Are you ignoring feedback because it&apos;s negative? At the end of the day, there is a reason the feedback is so negative towards Ashran. Maybe you should be more open to all types of feedback, as it stands Ashran hasn&apos;t improved since launch.<br>
We read plenty of negative feedback all the time. When it gets to an insulting level there&apos;s no point in wasting time on it. Many others can phrase their objections in reasonable and constructive ways. The less time we spend negotiating with the most hyperbolic and cynical people in the community, the more attention we can pay to the people making honest attempts to share their perspectives in civil fashion.<br>
<br>
It&apos;s not a complicated, diabolical, or arrogant concept. There has to be a practicality to sifting through opinions in such a large community.<br>
<br>
Given my previous post, I feel this is an opportune time to provide a simple example.<br>
<br>
With the event timers as LONG as they are now, and often times watching groups or being in groups doing nothing but sit at a spot with nothing at all happening because they have no interest in doing a road push, the LONG wait for anything to happen at all with any kind of reward is very dull.<br>
<br>
I did Ashran because I liked how it used to feel like old AV, and I don&apos;t like Arenas at all. For my PvP fix now I&apos;m more likely to go to regular BGs for points, and Heroes of the Storm for FUN. (Yeah, I know it&apos;s still a Blizzard game, I play it anyway, but it goes with the fact there&apos;s nothing rewardingly fun about Ashran now if you&apos;re even half CP geared, the box drop rate is abysmal.)<br>
<br>
What&apos;s worse is with the current state, the Gladiator&apos;s sanctum quests may never get done. I know my brother&apos;s been on the Pandaren one for months and has went into Ashran daily often to never find one at all on the Horde side.<br>
This is negative feedback. It&apos;s also constructive feedback. I don&apos;t have anything particular to respond with right now and otherwise wouldn&apos;t be -- as is the case with many posts in this thread -- but this is the type of stuff we register, document, and discuss internally. <br>
<br>
No response =\= ignored. <br>
<br>
Frankly, we can&apos;t take the time to acknowledge all decent feedback or respond to it directly, but that makes it no less useful to us. In many cases honest, constructive feedback will spur a discussion of ideas within the community, until finer points are scrutinized, debated, and sometimes augmented to reflect popular feedback. We love to see it and will participate in the discussion if we feel it&apos;ll somehow enhance the conversation or clarify common misconceptions.<br>
<br>
well that got stuffed up Zarhym. Oce servers have a 30 min + que atm because someone decided to join all of the OCE servers. It used to be insta entry on barth now I cant even get in, besides the fact I really don&apos;t want to. You broke your game even more<br>
It was necessary to open the matchmaking pools more similar to how BG queues are handled. While we really prefer to have opponents fighting from the same realm, or at least from a small enough pool that opponents&apos; names maybe familiar, many imbalanced and highly populated realms had extreme wait times, while low population realms had unfilled Ashran instances. Our 6.1 changes have leveled that out much more, though we&apos;ll continue to monitor the effects this has in each region.<br>
<br>
Not like a constant update but more of &quot;Hey, srry if patch *name* is taking a bit longer. We ran into a bad error&quot; Something like that would kind of make me feel a bit happy.<br>
We always try to provide as much insight and input as possible. The responsibility of crafting and relaying that info generally falls into the hands of us community managers though, as the developers are very busy taking in feedback, tackling bugs, designing new content, etc.<br>

<br>
Twitter Integration<br>
Real ID has to be enabled.<br>
That&apos;s probably the cause if the Twitter options are just not there in-game for you, and our apologies as it was a fairly late change so not many people internally were aware of how it was implemented. Right now Twitter functionality is tied to Real ID being enabled, as it allows us to ensure parental controls can disable access to Twitter. We really wanted parental controls to be able to block Twitter access if a parent wants to do that, and to get that done and get it into the patch the best option was to attach it to the Real ID setting. We&apos;re looking into separating them into their own options in the future.<br>
<br>
How can Real ID be enabled? I am not able to see the Twitter integration options either. I went to MENU --&gt; INTERFACE --&gt; BATTLE.NET , but none of the options enable it. So I&apos;m missing something others might be unaware of as well. Help would be appreciated. Thanks.<br>

Flight Path Routes<br>
Can we talk specifics?<br>
<br>
I&apos;ve just been checking out flight paths all over Draenor, looking at destinations that are three and four connections away, and they&apos;re noticeably direct. For example, from Horde Garrison to Pinchwhistle Gearworks (quite a long way), the flight path is almost perfectly straight.<br>
<br>
Of course, while on the taxi, I noted that there was *some* deviating from the straight line, but that was always in accordance with the terrain.
