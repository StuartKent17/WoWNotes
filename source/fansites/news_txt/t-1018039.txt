Boubouille2011-11-08, 10:43 PMWoW Lost 800k Subscribers, down to 10.3M
Activision Blizzard latest earning call revealed that World of Warcraft lost another 800,000 subscribers last quarter, following the loss of 300k subscribers announced last quarter http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2400-WoW-Lost-300k-Subscribers-Patch-4.3-this-year-Blizzcon-2011-Tickets-Blue-Posts and 600k loss from the quarter before that http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/901731-WoW-Loses-600k-Subscribers-Diablo-3-Beta-Q3-2011-Arena-Passe-Blue-Posts. This brings us to 1.7 million subscribers lost in the last 3 quarters. Some things they made note of on the call:



Most of the subscriptions were lost in China. 
There is normally an increase in subscriptions around December. 
The decreased profit came from all of the games in development and no launches occurring. 
There will be at least two major releases next year.
