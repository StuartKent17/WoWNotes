can u confirm how many guidlies need to be in a raid for it to count as a &quot;guild group&quot;? thanks<br>
For a raid group, 80% (rounded down) of the group must be from the same guild. Minimap icon will confirm if you qualify. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/647208814580596736))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
can you list the projects you personally worked on so we can lay to rest whether this post employment praise is warranted?<br>
I don&apos;t think that would lay anything to rest. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/647202708580003840))<br>
The truth is that nobody works on projects in a vacuum at Blizzard or Riot. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/647202842952859649))<br>
Nobody changes philosophy on their own. Those are all directions that the team is aligned around. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/647202965745348608))<br>
It is why I always caution players not to vilify (or deify) individual developers. That&apos;s just not the way game dev works. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/647203091188613120))<br>
If you don&apos;t like a feature or a philosophy by all means speak out. But blame the studio not those few whose names you know. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/647203273607286784))<br>

Community Spotlight: SulaMoon<br>
This week, we turn our attention to the wondrous art of SulaMoon, who recently answered our questions about her creative process and what inspires her work. <br>
<br>
Q: What influences your designs?<br>
This whole [Warcraft] series started because Cataclysm was such a cool looking spell that I just had to paint it. Casting it while glyphed in demon form, with horns and wings? Heck yeah! So I started sketching.<br>
<br>
Pretty soon I had the idea to see if I could fit my character and my friend&apos;s character into a series, making them into Hearthstone-style illustrations. The first one was my demon warlock, followed by my husband&apos;s retribution paladin. The priest is the leader of the guild, and a dear friend, so it was a gift for her.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
My idea is was to make their characters, favorite transmog set, and favorite spec all into one recognizable image. Raiding with them has been an awesome experience, so cheers! That&#x2019;s also why they&#x2019;re only Horde characters.<br>
<br>
Q: How long does it take to create images like these?<br>
I worked on this on my off-time, so I slip in a couple of minutes every chance I get. If I&apos;d add it all up, it would be around 15 hours per piece.<br>
<br>
I start with a rough sketch for pose and composition&#x2014;the overall posture of the piece. Once that&#x2019;s working, I move into adding the details to the sketch&#x2014;where I&apos;ll collect references for armor, weapons, and spell effects&#x2014;and add them over the initial sketch. A couple of times something breaks and I need to reorganize the whole sketch. I then do a grayscale pass to make sure the light will read and start working on volumes, and then I can move into color. There&#x2019;s a lot of polishing and making sure the materials read as they should.<br>
<br>

<br>
This is also the time where I&#x2019;ll take some liberties with the original set, and imagine how they would work if there weren&#x2019;t in-game technical restrictions. I particularly like painting shiny trinkets, so a lot of time is spent on highlights and sparkling effects.<br>
<br>
Q: What other works inspire you?<br>
In the illustration world, Joe Madureira&#x2014;his comic art but specially his work on Darksiders&#x2014;and Brom is also a huge one for me, and so is Drew Struzan! I also like Todd Lockwood, Dan dos Santos, and especially Wei Wang. He is amazing. I&apos;m also a movie fan&#x2014;I love watching and studying movies and their visual languages so I can capture a little bit of their magic when I paint. Also, soundtracks&#x2014;glorious, epic soundtracks by Hans Zimmer. I also play pen and paper RPGs. I really love this stuff, and I think the reason I&#x2019;m an artist nowadays it&apos;s because I&#x2019;m a fan of things like these. They&#x2019;re what pushes me forwards and makes me aim for greater things.<br>
<br>
Q: And what about video games for inspiration?<br>
I love raiding. I&#x2019;ve tried it hardcore, I&#x2019;ve tried it casual, and I enjoy it more than I can socially admit. I had to step down from hardcore to a bit more casual playstyle so I could work on my art too. It was weird at the time, but now that I have found a guild I can call home I am in comfortable position to keep both going.<br>

<br>
I also love the lore in the game, and I have a couple of friends I can geek out with about the lore until my heart is content. And of course, I love the art in Warcraft&#x2014;in-game, comics, and I can&apos;t wait for the movie! The heaviness of the style, the details, the scenery, the races. The community is also amazing, and I have made many friends inside the game over all the years playing.<br>
<br>
Q: If you could add one thing to the game, artistically, what would it be?<br>
Customizable horns! Yes! But wait, this one is already promised. So how about Dreadsteeds that fly with a blazing trail of fire in the skies!<br>
Another great thing would be more detailed armor, in the chest area especially. I love the work being done over with models in Heroes of the Storm, and I&apos;d love to see something similar in WoW too!<br>
<br>
Our thanks goes out to SulaMoon for sharing these lovely pieces with the WoW community.<br>

The Heroes PTR (http://www.heroesnexus.com/news/1499-test-map-reworked-skins-and-animations-v2-matthew) got increased respawn times and smaller stat differences between levels at lower levels to try and make games more even if a team falls a little behind early on.<br>
