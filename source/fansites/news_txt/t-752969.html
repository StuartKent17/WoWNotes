I guess that works. Will try to get a better picture when the shiny little murloc appears in my game files.<br>
&quot;Death will rise from the tide!&quot; Level 80 Elite Tauren Chieftain once warned -- and at BlizzCon 2010, the band&apos;s dire musical prophecy will finally come to pass. Everyone who attends this year&apos;s BlizzCon or purchases the BlizzCon Virtual Ticket will receive an exclusive set of murlocalyptic in-game items for World of Warcraft and StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. World of Warcraft players will be joined by Deathy, a murloc companion decked out as Deathwing and doing his best to strike fear into the hearts of Azeroth&apos;s crustacean population. You&apos;ll also be able to display your tidal pride in StarCraft II with a Murloc Marine character portrait and a pair of deep-sea decals to emblazon on your units, each with a different terran, protoss, and zerg design.<br>
<br>
BlizzCon 2010 takes place on October 22 and 23 at the Anaheim Convention Center. For further details or to order the BlizzCon Virtual Ticket, visit www.BlizzCon.com.<br>
