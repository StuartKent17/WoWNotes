Another wave of hotfix has been deployed on live realms including a very interesting one ... Also, the Oculus has been nerfed once again!<br>
1/5/10<br>
<br>
The proc for the item, The Last Word, has been greatly increased to allow for more continuous uptime.<br>
The NPC Margrave Dhakar in Icecrown will properly respawn if killed while doing the quest, The Flesh Giant Champion.<br>
Wyvern Sting no longer triggers the extra shot effect from Zod&apos;s Repeating Longbow.<br>
The Oculus had some additional changes made. The Planar Anomlies during the Eregos encounter will have a shorter duration and do reduced damage, some of the drakes above Varos&#x2019;s platform have been removed, and the drakes controlled by players will move a little faster.<br>
Players can now send a whisper to a player from another realm that is currently in their party.<br>
The Invigoration buff from melee attacks using the Heartpierce dagger will now grant twice as much resources as before. It now grants 2 rage, 4 energy, or 120 mana every 2 seconds for 10 seconds.<br>

Malevolent Girdle is under item budget (Malevolent Girdle (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50987/malevolent-girdle/))<br>
Yes, it&apos;s a bug. We will get it fixed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22419022305-malevolent-girdle-is-under-item-budget.html))<br>

Lady Deathwhisper 25-man nerf<br>
I was going to reply but this summed things up pretty well. A lot of players killed Lady Deathwhisper, but a lot of people also struggled with it which wasn&apos;t the intent. These changes did not impact on the heroic version though changes may be made down the road on those as they start to see some action.

Heroism/Bloodlust Drums<br>
Shaman aren&apos;t a support class. They have some very nice buffs, but those aren&apos;t the same thing. The older design of the shaman was that you bring them in order to make the rest of the group really shine. That&apos;s not really where we see the class now. You should want one in your raid, but you should be okay if you don&apos;t have one. Put another way, we don&apos;t want to to make stacking one class too appealing, but we want you to have flexibility, especially in 10-player raids.<br>
<br>
We don&apos;t want anyone being brought to a raid just because they have a super special buff that the group considers mandatory. Some people consider Bloodlust mandatory and some don&apos;t. At the very least it is brought by all 3 trees of shaman, versus say something like the Scorch +crit debuff only really belonging to Fire mages (and there are multiple ways to get that one now too).<br>
<br>
Now it&apos;s also possible to homogenize buffs too much. If it&apos;s trivially easy to get everything you need then we might as well just cast a &quot;you&apos;re better&quot; aura on you anytime you&apos;re in a raid. Don&apos;t let the fact that we&apos;re moving away from the &quot;you have to have me&quot; model to mean the opposite extreme is where we want to end up.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re not sure we&apos;ll make Bloodlust drums for the reasons we stated above. But we&apos;re not worried about the concern that shaman will never get invited again. You shouldn&apos;t be getting invited because of your buff today. You should get invited because you&apos;re not annoying and because you contribute to progress.
