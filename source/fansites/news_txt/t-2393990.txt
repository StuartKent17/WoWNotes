Good allies are hard to find, but don’t worry—we’ve got you covered in Battle for Azeroth. Meet two new Allied Races that will become available over the course of your adventures in the new expansion, the Dark Iron dwarves and Mag’har orcs, and learn a bit about the racial traits currently in development.

Alliance: Dark Iron Dwarves
Known for their fiery tempers and fierce determination, Dark Iron dwarves have a turbulent history with the other clans. A failed coup in Ironforge ignited the War of the Three Hammers, and many of the Dark Iron once fought in the service of Ragnaros the Firelord. Though one faction is pledged to Queen-Regent Moira Thaurissan, others refuse to stand alongside their kin. The Alliance seeks a united Dark Iron clan to harness the power of Azerite and aid their struggle against the Horde.

Horde: Mag’har Orc
For untold generations, the orc clans of Draenor battled one another in endless war. But when Gul'dan offered them the blood of his demonic masters, the disparate tribes of Mag'har—the orcish word for "uncorrupted"—refused the dark bargain and banded together to drive out the Burning Legion. United under the leadership of Grommash Hellscream, the Mag'har pledged to one day repay Azeroth's heroes for aiding their cause. As war against the Alliance intensifies, the Horde must call upon the might of the Mag'har to seize victory.

We’ll have more information on how to recruit these new allies in a future update; for now, those with Battle for Azeroth beta access will be able to create one of these new Allied Races within character creation screen and begin testing.

Which Allied Race will you choose?


Volunteer Guard Dayvgd
Volunteer Guard Day http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/635-volunteer-guard-day allows you to help defend your faction's city and take on the appearance of a guard.


Approach any guard in your faction's city and /salute them

Alliance: Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, The Exodar, Stormshield
Horde: Orgrimmar, Thunder Bluff, Undercity, Silvermoon, or Warspear

You will take on the appearance of the guard you interacted with, along with a 24H Volunteer City Guard http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/231193-volunteer-city-guard buff.
While you have the buff, City Invaders will spawn when you are in town and attack you. Defeat them to increase your kill count.
Killing 10 attackers adds the "Defender of X" to your buff, 50 for "Heroic Defender", and 250 for "Mythic Defender". This doesn't appear to have any actual effect.
This buff persists through death and changing of zones, but will be lost when entering an instance.
You can get the buff back again by saluting a guard. Losing the buff will not reset your kill counter.
