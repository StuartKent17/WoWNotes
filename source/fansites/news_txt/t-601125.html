<br>
There was one problem though, i&apos;ve never been in Karazhan (or in any instance actually, this is why i need raid guides writers. ^^) and there are a lot of bosses which make the process of creating a guide for each one based on friend&apos;s feedback pretty slow.<br>
<br>
But Soul Society (http://nordrassor.freehostia.com/phpBB/index.php) from US-Deathwing server saved the day ! I would like to thanks the whole guild and especially Naggrodamus who allowed me to use the guides on the website. <br>
<br>
I will probably add screenshots when i&apos;ve got more time. Missing bosses/events should be added soon too. (probably tomorrow, i&apos;m kinda short on time tonight)</div></div>
