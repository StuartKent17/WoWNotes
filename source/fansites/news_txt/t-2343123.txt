Once antorus releases, will mythic+ gear still be capped at +10? or will it be changed to +15 again?
The ceiling on Mythic Keystone rewards will go up to 15 the week of Dec. 5, when the Mythic difficulty of Antorus opens. If you did a Mythic Keystone 11-15 the prior week, that effort will be reflected in your weekly chest on Dec. 5. WarcraftDevs 

What is the current year lore wise in WoW? I'm saying 33, my friends are saying 38. Which of us is right?
I believe we'd be going into 33 with BFA Alex_Afrasiabi 

Hey Alex! May daily question in hopes that you'll respond: Will the Ebon Blade continue to create new death knights in BFA?
DK creation exists in a pocket of time Wrath which is why you start at 55 and also why we have to be careful about what races can be DK. So DK creation will continue to exist in that fashion. Alex_Afrasiabi 
Sorry for the many replies, but here is the quest:  - notice what he says upon completion
It doesnâ€™t change how death knights are created in WoW. Which is back during the Wrath era. They are not mutually exclusive. Alex_Afrasiabi
