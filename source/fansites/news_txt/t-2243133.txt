New PTR Realm Test - Temporus
Starting today we’ll be performing a connected realm test on the PTR and we’re looking for as many players as possible to help. A new temporary realm named ‘Temporus’ will be coming online from 6/23 until 6/26. Character copy is enabled on this realm, we would like you to copy your Live characters over to this realm via the ‘Character Copy’ button, log in, and take stock of your character’s gear and progress, including:

Completed quests
In-Progress quests and current progression
Current gear loadout
Achievements both earned and in-progress
Pets and mounts

Then, on Monday 6/26 the realm will come down and we’ll be connecting Temporus to the other PTR realms. Once complete, we’ll need those participating to log back in and check our work! Please comment below with your findings. We’re especially interested in finding out if anything is missing, or if there are any gameplay progression issues and other things of that nature.

Thanks in advance for your participation! Please keep an eye on this thread for any updates.


Sun Darter Hatchling Guide
The WoW secrets discord  recently discovered how to get the Sun Darter Hatchling  Items needed to complete the puzzle:


Major Fire Protection Potion 

Major Arcane Protection Potion 

Major Frost Protection Potion 

Major Holy Protection Potion 

Major Shadow Protection Potion 

10x Noggenfogger Elixir 

Scotty’s Lucky Coin 

Dire Brew 

Ethereal Oil 

Gordok Ogre Suit 

Winterfall Firewater 

10x Pygmy Oil 

Perky Pug 

“Little Princess” Costume 

Scroll of Intellect 


Step-by-Step Guide:
Make sure to follow the guide down to the letter, otherwise you might have to start over!


Enter the cave at 57.0, 16.0 North coast of Winterspring
To get past the first barrier orange use a Major Fire Protection Potion 
To get past the second barrier green use the other 5 potions you collected Frost, Holy, Nature, Shadow, Fire, Arcane
To get past the Diligent Watcher use Noggenfogger Elixir  until you become a skeleton, which will allow you to walk past him
When you get to the split in the path, go to the wall of vines and use Scotty’s Lucky Coin 
Once transformed, you can enter the room and pick up the Water Stone  from the pool — use the stone, and you'll be granted a buff allowing you to get past the blue barrier backtrack to where the road splits and you will see it
Use Dire Brew  to walk past the Stone Watcher 
The path splits into three at this point - you will need to follow them in the order described below
First, go up the ramp towards the purple barrier on the right side, and use Ethereal Oil  to get through it
You will see a Strange Stone with a hole for your arm - use Gordok Ogre Suit  and Winterfall Firewater , then click the stone
Second, go back to the gate on the left and use x10 Pygmy Oil  until you become a Pygmy — this will allow you to walk through the gate to the Wisdom Cube
Summon your Perky Pug  and use the “Little Princess” Costume  on it, then interact with the cube and select Place arm beneath cube.
Head back to the intersection and go towards the gate at the bottom
The gate should be open, and the corridor leads to a Tarnished Plaque — make sure to click it
Before entering the water, cancel your Winterfall Firewater  by right clicking on it, and apply the Scroll of Intellect  to yourself
Then you can enter the water and loot the pet from the Oddly-Colored Egg
Make sure you enter the lake through one of the two paths, otherwise you will get ported out
If you get ported out at any point just run back in, you should be able to make it back to the point you got kicked out at
Congrats on your new Sun Darter Hatchling!

Blue Tweets
Just obliterated 3 pieces of pvp gear and only got 3 Echoes of Battle in total. Is this a bug?
You can now obliterate Legion Season 4 Battleground-quality gear for a few Echoes. Gladiator gear is worth more. WarcraftDevs 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
A more general game design question if I may. You’ve worked previously on WoW and now LoL, two massively popular live games that continue to be iterated. I’m curious if game developers and game designers have some sort of rule or measure that determines when it’s time for the game to stop being updated and instead moved towards a full on sequel.
It’s ultimately a business decision. 

If, for example, you sell a box copy of your game then you probably drive more revenue if you just make a new game every year or two rather than try to keep supporting an older version of the game. Sports games that release a new edition every season and some franchises that are on their eighth or higher sequel do so because players have demonstrated they will pay for those. Dungeons and Dragons has gone through five editions now, and that’s at least in part because the core rulebooks are their most reliable products in terms of sales. You need a new rulebook to support a new edition.

League is a free to play game, so we would get no benefit from making a League 2, at least in terms of “selling” more copies. It’s possible we could make a huge marketing splash if we made a big enough deal about how League 2 is coming, and that might get more players in the short term, but we think we can keep players ultimately happier just by iterating on what we have today rather than a massive rebranding exercise.

Sometimes developers feel that they can solve systemic problems by starting with a clean slate. For example, if your rules or content become too complex, maybe it makes sense to start over which is another reason D&D makes versions. If your veteran players are too far removed from newer players, a reset is a good way to bring everyone to parity once again.

I do want to add that I often get the perception from some players that making a sequel can be a good way to clean the slate technically as well. I’ll get questions about WoW or LoL and how just starting over with a new engine would let us do more. But game engines aren’t like car engines that you just plug into a chassis. If you want to add a new pathfinding algorithm, or renderer, or particle emitter, or matchmaking system to your game, you can do that to your existing code base. While it might be cleaner sometimes to start with no legacy code, it might also take years to re-create every feature in a brand new code base. For example, we’re almost finished with a brand new client for League, and we didn’t have to spin up League of Legends 2 to do so. Source 


Build of the Month - June 2017
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

All of the parts on this page are Amazon affiliate links. When you purchase your parts through them it helps support the site!

This month
There is currently a shortage of GPUs, resulting in availability issues and drastically increased prices. 

The current SSD prices  are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale.

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 7700K and would get more performance from spending that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions!
