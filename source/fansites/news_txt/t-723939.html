Apparently it went down the front page a little too fast and a couple of people missed it. <br>

It&apos;s time for another TCG Loot giveaway, courtesy of WoWTCGLoot.com (http://www.wowtcgloot.com/) once again. <br>
<br>

<br>
How does it work?<br>
It&apos;s easy, just become a Fan of MMO-Champion on Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/pages/MMO-Champion/132326176778287) and/or Follow me on Twitter (http://twitter.com/Boubouille_MMO)!

<br>
I had some time to learn how all that stuff works and you can probably expect more interesting loot super-soon (... and surprise tweets if I&apos;m in the mood!)<br>
