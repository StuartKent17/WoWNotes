Ressing in Arena
Resurrections in arena is something that has been around since it was implemented. You have 10 seconds, excluding haste, to reach your target and interrupt or bring them into combat. If they are able to gain those precious few moments out of combat then I can only congratulate them on some very solid play. I recommend that you do your utmost to stay in range of your enemy and prevent them from casting their resurrection spell.
