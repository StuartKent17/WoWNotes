This Month in WoW - January 2016<br>
Happy new year! January rings in with a bang with fireworks over the cities of Azeroth, and ends with the deep of winter. Bundle up and warm yourself by the fire of activities ahead.<br>

In-Game Events<br>
<br>
Feast of Winter Veil (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/events/feast-of-winter-veil) [Ends January 2]<br>
For the first couple of days of January, you still have an opportunity to enjoy the Feast of Winter Veil. While enjoying a freshly nutmegged cup of nog, and crunching on a crumbly cookie or two, be sure to visit Greatfather Winter in Ironforge if you&#x2019;re Alliance, or Great-father Winter in Orgrimmar if you&#x2019;re Horde. While there, you&#x2019;ll find a few treats, and surely a few tasks to take on as well.<br>
<br>

Why is so much utility being pruned from classes anyways? I get ability bloat.. but Utility is not bloat.<br>
Check out the class blogs. It&apos;s unlikely that whatever you&apos;re referring to is related to &apos;bloat&apos; or &apos;pruning&apos;. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/681518149628465153))<br>
It&apos;s more likely that it&apos;s related to delivering a strong class fantasy, distinct from the others&apos;. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/681518292901715969))<br>
Sometimes, we&apos;ve spread something around to so many classes, it no longer feels special. Trying to solve that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/681518563207831556))<br>

Activision Blizzard Acquires MLG Assets<br>
While nothing has been officially announced yet, eSportsObserver is reporting (http://esportsobserver.com/mlg-sells-substantially-all-assets-to-activision-blizzard-for-46-million/) that Activision Blizzard has acquired substantially all of Major League Gaming&apos;s assets for $46 million. MLG will be renamed to MLG Legacy Holdings, Inc. <br>
<br>
You may remember that earlier this year (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5208-Curse-Blizzcon-Party-Valor-and-Crafted-Items-Engineering-Panel-Voice-Chat-eSports), Activision Blizzard announced the new eSports Division, headed up by Mike Sepso, a co-founder and president of MLG.<br>
