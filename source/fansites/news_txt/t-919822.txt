Boubouille2011-06-09, 07:49 AMPatch 4.2 - Firelands Raid Weapons Previews
Some people have been requesting models of Firelands Raid weapons, here is your preview! You can probably expect more content in the next 2 weeks now that we have a release date for the patch forcing me to enter my "OMG HURRY!" mode. 

Also, keep in mind that these models might be slightly different in-game, etc ... but most of the time they should be fairly accurate. And some of them look pretty nice http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_8SczGj1q0

Reminder - Ask The Devs #9 - Tanking
The latest Ask the Devs was published a couple of hours ago and focused on tanking, it had a couple of interesting information and you might want to read it. 



Ask The Devs #9 - Tanking http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2333-Ask-The-Devs-9-Tanking


Among other things, developers hinted at the next legendary weapon to be released in Patch 4.3.
Q: Will we see a tanking Legendary sometime soon? – Pedoso NA

A: The tanking community both loves and hates when this question comes up, but it received a lot of votes, so we’ll answer it. The answer is not soon, but probably eventually. The problem with tanking legendaries, of course, is that the shield-users and non-shield-users tank with different weapons. That’s not a deal breaker, but it is a consideration. We could allow the legendary to be transformed from a one-hander to two-hander or we could just design an item for a more narrow audience such as a shield. The 4.2 legendary has fairly wide appeal, and the 4.3 legendary will have much more narrow appeal. We don’t want to fall into the trap of making legendaries too formulaic.

Making poison buffs permanent
I remember when I had to mix poisons using reagents, buy different reagents depending on which level of poison I wanted to create, they had charges as well as duration, and they were wiped every time I zoned into or out of an instance... Uphill, in the snow, beset by amorous troggs, both ways.

I think that when we apply poisons or cast any buff, really it makes us feel more connected to our characters and what they're about. It would be marginally more convenient to simply cast a buff once or never cast it at all and forever benefit from the buff in question, but that's not very interesting or involving. It would also remove a lot of context; your character should be more than just a collection of pixels. What you do in-game should have some meaning; even if it's as simple as tipping a bottle and poisoning a dagger.

Of course, things have become more convenient over time as well, and there may be a time when it makes sense to remove a buff duration. I just wanted to point out that it's not totally pointless, and even the slightly "inconvenient" things play a role in how it feels to play a class. 

[...] I think the current system balances a sense of involvement with convenience pretty well. I'd rather be fighting mobs or PvPing than sitting in Ironforge buying bagfuls of reagents to fill my poison bag, but I feel that it's good that I still need to pay a visit to the Shady Dealer now and then.
