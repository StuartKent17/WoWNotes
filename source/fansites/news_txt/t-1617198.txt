Warlords of Draenor - Creeping Carpet and Dustmane Direwolf
Today we are taking a look at two of the mounts you can craft in Warlords of Draenor, the Creeping Carpet http://www.wowdb.com/spells/169952-creeping-carpet and Dustmane Direwolf http://www.wowdb.com/spells/171844-dustmane-direwolf.

The Creeping Carpet http://www.wowdb.com/items/115363-creeping-carpet can be crafted by tailors. It requires 100 x Hexweave Cloth http://www.wowdb.com/items/111556-hexweave-cloth, which is a daily cooldown that makes 10 per day at max Tailoring skill. The Tailoring Emporium http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/128-tailoring-emporium can help to produce additional cloth. It also requires 20 x Sorcerous Air http://www.wowdb.com/items/113264-sorcerous-air. 

The Riding Harness http://www.wowdb.com/items/108883-riding-harness works in a similar way, requiring 100 x Burnished Leather http://www.wowdb.com/items/110611-burnished-leather and 20 x Sorcerous Air http://www.wowdb.com/items/113264-sorcerous-air.

7 Day Game Time Promotion Emails
From time to time we run different promotional offers for a subset of players, but they’re generally not something offered to everyone. Which is why this may work on the accounts that were offered the promotion, and not others.

Raid Progress on The Armory
As you already noticed, the Raid Progress feature has been removed from the Armory for now. This is not a bug, it was intended as we decided to rework the feature, so don’t worry, it’s just a matter of time before it will return Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/346524-why-oh-why/ / Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/12534713394?page=1#6
