Warlords of Draenor - Creeping Carpet and Dustmane Direwolf
Today we are taking a look at two of the mounts you can craft in Warlords of Draenor, the Creeping Carpet  and Dustmane Direwolf 

The Creeping Carpet  can be crafted by tailors. It requires 100 x Hexweave Cloth , which is a daily cooldown that makes 10 per day at max Tailoring skill. The Tailoring Emporium  can help to produce additional cloth. It also requires 20 x Sorcerous Air  

The Riding Harness  works in a similar way, requiring 100 x Burnished Leather  and 20 x Sorcerous Air

7 Day Game Time Promotion Emails
From time to time we run different promotional offers for a subset of players, but they’re generally not something offered to everyone. Which is why this may work on the accounts that were offered the promotion, and not others. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Raid Progress on The Armory
As you already noticed, the Raid Progress feature has been removed from the Armory for now. This is not a bug, it was intended as we decided to rework the feature, so don’t worry, it’s just a matter of time before it will return Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
