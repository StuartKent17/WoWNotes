Stoy2019-05-14, 03:03 PMLive Raid Tuning - May 14
With weekly resets in each region, we’re making the following adjustments to three raid encounters.


Battle of Dazar’alor

Lady Jaina Proudmoore

The random Bombard locations in stage one are now less likely to light a Zandalari Ballista on fire when players are not nearby.
Chilling Touch now begins when Arcane Barrage is interrupted previously was when Nathanos is freed.
Prismatic Images now spawn closer to Jaina was centered on the middle of the area.
Icefall is timed to no longer coincide with full power Gathering Blizzard in Mythic difficulty.
Gathering Blizzard and Freezing Blood should now be more responsive in Mythic difficulty.
Jaina’s health has been reduced by 5% in Mythic difficulty.


Crucible of Storms

The Restless Cabal

Void Crash and Crushing Doubt now prefer ranged targets.
Witness the End duration reduced to 7 seconds was 9 seconds in Mythic difficulty.
Zaxasj the Speaker and Fa’thuul the Feared health reduced by 5% in Mythic difficulty.

Uu’nat, Harbinger of the Void

Void Crash now prefers ranged targets.
Insatiable Torment now prefers damage dealers.
Piercing Gaze of N’Zoth duration reduced to 4 seconds was 5 seconds in Mythic difficulty.
Undying Guardians health reduced by 17% in Mythic difficulty.
The number of players targeted with Unstable Resonance has been reduced to 12 per cast was 18 and now prefers ranged targets on Mythic difficulty.
Uu’nat’s health reduced by 5% in Mythic difficulty.




In Crucible of Storms, along with slightly reducing the overall difficulty of its encounters on Mythic difficulty, these changes are aimed at encouraging more diverse raid compositions, as well as making the encounters more accessible to guilds with melee-heavy rosters.

Again, these changes should go live with resets in each region.


Battle for Azeroth Dungeon Event
This week's bonus event is the Battle for Azeroth Dungeon Event. 


All week long the final boss of each Battle for Azeroth Dungeon will drop an extra piece of loot.

PvP Brawl - Warsong Scramble
Every other week a new PvP Brawl will be available to players looking for something just a little different. Each Brawl will offer a variety of modes, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay, and you’ll find them in the Group Finder tool hotkey “I” in the Player vs. Player tab. Just like Random Battlegrounds, you’ll receive a reward for achieving victory. 

Warsong Scramble – Capture the Flag
Do you have a flag? Warsong Gulch has always been the scene of an epic Capture the Flag battle, but what happens when you can capture your enemy’s flag without your own at base? Find out when you step into this PvP Brawl! We’ve also added a few more power-ups to the field of battle to stir things up a bit. To win, your team will need to be the first to capture 5 flags.
