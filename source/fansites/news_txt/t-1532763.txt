No instant starsurge affects DPS on the move alot.Most moonkins use starsurge instant cast procs as a 1 second time of movement
We decided to go with trying Instant Starsurges. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473323667594555392

Will Moonkin be able to show their armor or are we destined to always be owl beast models from duskwood no matter the gear? 
Did you miss Glyph of Stars? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473325592813645825

Sine-wave is very forgiving to timing. The bonus damage is minute due to it. And it's very, very easy to learn&master.
FYI, based on testing, we're going to try a 40sec long cycle still 20sec with Euphoria. DoT base duration raised to 20sec too. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473493727437012992
It also pauses at the ends now most of the added time.Nerdy details: Now a sine wave between -110 and 110, capped at -100/100 Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473494231097438208
This change makes it less stressful, not really less skillful. Skill is still strong. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473538341799878656
Starsurge and Astral Communion usage are the biggest high end skill differentiators now. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473538647732400128
DoT uptime and Wrath/Starfire are solid core mechanics to master. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473538875294351362

Would u consider cutting two seconds off freezing trap and scatter so they can coexist in WoD? Scatter is ideal for landing traps.
We'll see how the change works out in testing. There is a benefit of getting rid of an instant CC button. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473532110263709697

will the base damage increase to tanks be enough to make leveling as prot viable?
Absolutely. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473255954171953152

Doesn't that mean in effect, that Devouring Plague still technically snapshots?
Yes, for [6/Haste] sec. Little snapshots like that are fine. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473493234522390529

Character / Items
Hey, Will we ever see new weapons with cool 'equip' or 'chance on hit' effects like the ones from DS?
Potentially. We try to mix it up. Some tiers we go a little more crazy with trinkets, sometimes weapons, etc. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472265388248403968

not sure what the state of tier bonuses is in WOD, but will Mythic tier have the same bonuses as Normal/Heroic tier?
Yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472311311997489153

Achievements
Herald of the Titans achieve/title still going to be available in WoD?
Should be, yes. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/472258367671791617

PvP
Will garrisons have any PvP aspects/benefits/gameplay involved? Thanks!
still discussing holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/472349389923434496

Wtf Heart of the Valorous? How about Honorable Heart or Hear of the Conqueror for a bit? C'mon you knew it was coming
Valor and Conquest serve very different purposes. Valor doesn't give you gear. Conquest does. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/472425747999490048
There are already tremendous catch-up mechanics in place for PvP: rating inflation and catch-up cap. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/472425881441284096

One of the issue's with Ret in PvP atm is that Templar's Verdict is too weak as a finisher. Outside of major cd's Ret is no threat.
"Outside of cooldowns I'm not threat" is a complaint we here from every spec with cooldowns. It's why we're removing many of them. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/472790124283957249

Just wondering if you guys have put any thought into scaling gear up in pvp bgs before WoD?
No there is tech involved to do this that's coming in Warlords. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/472793339230572545

Will PvP set bonuses change as we change spec in WoD?
yes holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473539416141873153

is chaos bolt damage reduced by 25% against player?
Yes it's damage is reduced against players in Mists. Possibly not in Warlords. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473530994188771328
In WOD pvp crit reduction means CB does 25% less against players anyway, doesn't it?
yes holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473539469279522816
Dont you think crit and other stats should be downscaled in PVE too? To have the same rules for PVE and PVP?
Crits are awesome so you can say "woah HUGE number" but gameplay dictates different magnitudes in two modes holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473560070396313600

could we see some news on Ashran soon? Would love to see some more in-depth discussion about the "Ashran Only" weapons.
We're getting to a point where we think we'll have a lot more to share soon. But we're early on in that process. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473576727235407873

Garrisons
Out of curiosity, will our friends in the farm become followers in our garrison?
The Panda farm? They don't... really want to go through that portal. Best to stay near a brewery. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/472222928923156480
