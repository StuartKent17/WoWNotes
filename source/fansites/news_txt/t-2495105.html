Get Murgle the Red Murloc Plush and Mug July 9!<br>
The Queen of Tides has returned with Rise of Azshara (https://worldofwarcraft.com/news/23014432/), bringing a ton of new experiences to encounter&#x2014;including many rare creatures&#x2014;in Battle for Azeroth. One such creature is the elusive rare red baby murloc pet, Murgle. You can find Murgle in Nazjatar&#x2019;s Bloodfin Village, but you&#x2019;ll need to summon and defeat King Gakula first. Stirring up a little trouble with the village tadpoles is sure to draw him out.<br>
