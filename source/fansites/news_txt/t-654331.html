Based on player feedback and testing, we will be making several changes to Isle of Conquest in the next test realm build. We&apos;d like to lay them out for you here in the hopes we&apos;re able to encourage continued participation and feedback.<br>
<br>
Increased all the gates&apos; health from 300,000 to 600,000.<br>
Increased the reinforcement count from 200 to 400.<br>
Significantly increased the health and damage of the keep generals.<br>
<br>
Seaforium<br>
Reduced effect range of the siege damage caused. Both the player damage and the siege damage caused should be 10 yards now.<br>
The Huge Seaforium piles will now despawn for 20 seconds once looted.<br>
<br>
Glaive Thrower<br>
Reduced the cooldown of Blade Salvo from 60 seconds to 30 seconds.<br>
Reduced movement speed.<br>
<br>
Demolisher<br>
The Hurl Boulder and Ram effects no longer share a cooldown.<br>
<br>
Keep Cannons<br>
Fixed a bug that was causing them to do much more damage than intended.<br>
Keep Cannons can now be repaired once they are destroyed by clicking on them. This repair process takes 8 seconds and can be interrupted, similar to capturing a PvP objective.<br>
<br>
Siege Engine<br>
Significantly Increased health.<br>
<br>
Your testing of this new Battleground thus far has proven invaluable and we ask that you please keep the feedback coming once these changes have been applied.</div></div>
