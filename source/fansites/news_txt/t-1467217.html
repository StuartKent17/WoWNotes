Dev Watercooler: Pruning the Garden of War Twitter Q&amp;A<br>
Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon) and Holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka) answered some questions on Twitter that arose from the Watercooler posted earlier tonight (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3805-Dev-Watercooler-Pruning-the-Garden-of-War).<br>
Future Blog Posts<br>
You&apos;re better off making a blue post about racials/class abilities rather than tweets. Info overload! future watercooler?<br>
Working on it, just wasn&apos;t ready in time, and didn&apos;t want to delay the blog post. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439229367567126528))<br>
<br>
To those /sadpanding at the blog, you&apos;re not after the philosophy. You&apos;re after the patch notes which still aren&apos;t available yet. (Rygarius (https://twitter.com/Rygarius/status/439234406931509248))<br>
<br>
Alliance Racials<br>
Humans lose the Mace (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/20864-mace-specialization)/Sword (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/20597-sword-specialization) racials. The Human Spirit (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/20598-the-human-spirit) becomes +X to two secondary stats of your choice. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439222126214541314))<br>
Change to Human Spirit seems really cool. Can you talk about the interface for choosing which secondary stats it&apos;ll give you?<br>
Still designing it. Probably a flyout button of some sort (like Rogue Poisons, Mage Portals, etc) (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439233867212664833))<br>
The idea is interesting, but are you worried it will be too strong since it&apos;s customizable? Or just needs proper tuning<br>
The downside is that it&apos;s split between two. If haste is your best stat, 1% haste is better than 0.5%haste + 0.5% crit. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439241020564205569))<br>
<br>
Weapon Specialization racials are removed because Hit/Exp are removed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439234502678691841))<br>
<br>
Draenei&apos;s Heroic Presence (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/28878-heroic-presence) is now +X to your primary stat. Gift of the Naaru heals for the same amount but over 5sec. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439222382104829952))<br>
<br>
Night Elves&apos; Quickness (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/20582-quickness) also increases movement speed by 2% passively. They also got a new passive which is quite unique... (Remember, no more haste breakpoints!) Touch of Elune, a new passive which grants 1% Haste at night, 1% Crit during the day. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439223286140895234))<br>
Might annoy some specs that benefit from one stat but not another (e.g. feral druids benefit from crit, but not haste)<br>
We&apos;re making sure that everyone benefits from them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439240576555184130))<br>
Shadowmeld (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/58984-shadowmeld) is unchanged. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439225238052556800))<br>
<br>
Gnomes&apos; Escape Artist (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/20589-escape-artist) dropped to a 1min CD (from 1.5min), and Shortblade Specialization became Nimble Fingers, 1% Haste. Also a tweak to Expansive Mind (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/20591-expansive-mind). Was +5% max Mana. Now +5% Max Mana, Energy, Rage, or Runic Power. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439233615252058113))<br>
<br>
Darkflight (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/68992-darkflight) is staying unchanged. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439221811469750272))<br>
<br>
Dwarves lost Crack Shot (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/20595-crack-shot) and Mace Specialization (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/59224-mace-specialization). Gained Might of the Mountain, a passive which adds 2% Crit Damage and Healing. Also a change to Stoneform (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/20594-stoneform): Also removes Magic/Curse. HOWEVER, it still cannot be used while CC&apos;d. (It is still NOT a CC-break) (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439230802715373571))<br>
<br>
Horde Racials<br>
Undead are seeing relatively few changes. Tweaks to the scaling rate of Touch of the Grave (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/5227-touch-of-the-grave), and WotF (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/7744-will-of-the-forsaken) to 3min CD (up from 2). (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439220484320681984))<br>
<br>
Blood Elves gain Arcane Acuity, a 1% crit passive. Arcane Torrent now restores 20RunicPower, or 1HoPo, or 3% Mana. (Also, Rage and Chi) (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439225914375675904))<br>
<br>
Orcs were one of the outliers we brought down. Lost the Axe Specialization (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/20574-axe-specialization), and Hardiness (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/20573-hardiness) is 10% Stun reduction (down from 15%). (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439224917289353216))<br>
Blood Fury (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/20572-blood-fury) is unchanged. Every Man For Himself (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/59752-every-man-for-himself), we&apos;re still evaluating. Itemization changes may mean no nerf needed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439225445427335169))<br>
<br>
Tauren&apos;s Endurance (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/20550-endurance) becomes +X Stamina. Brawn is a new passive which increases Crit Damage/Healing by 2%. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439237955681390593))<br>
<br>
Can you tell us what exactly will be changing with the Troll racial Berserking (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/26297-berserking)?<br>
Reduced to 15% Haste (down from 20%). (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439226136535396352))<br>
<br>
Will there be any changes to Worgen and Goblin racials?<br>
Not much. They were about at baseline. Time is Money (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/69042-time-is-money) becomes real 1% Haste, not just attack speed / cast speed. Subtle diff. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439231597707948032))<br>
<br>
Squish<br>
Re the squish, simple yes/no question-- will noninstanced world bosses like Oondasta be soloable at level 100?<br>
I&apos;d be surprised if really skilled players didn&apos;t solo him at 100. Heck, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if a couple are close already. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439224406691164160))<br>
<br>
Any idea what enchants &amp; set bonuses that currently reduce disarm duration will turn into?<br>
We&apos;ll change the set bonuses but the weapon chains won&apos;t be relevant anymore. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439228893896007681))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
PvP trinkets now grant immunity to reapplication of an effect from the same spell= bad idea, everything else good.<br>
You actually want to trinket a Solar Beam, and have it instantly reapply to you? (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439224661679685633))<br>
<br>
&quot;Long fears are now shorter in PvP due to the added benefit of a fear changing the players position.&quot; How short?<br>
6sec instead of 8sec. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439220183819767808))<br>
<br>
Is paralyze dispellable? Like cyclone is going to be.<br>
It&apos;s a physical effect, like gouge, so it can&apos;t be dispelled.<br>
Cyclone is not a physical effect?<br>
No it&apos;s magic<br>
Magic in WoD, you mean? It&apos;s always been Physical CC.<br>
It&apos;s more of a &quot;behind the curtain&quot; thing here. It&apos;s actually magic, it just isn&apos;t dispellable. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439224000657358848))<br>
<br>
Can we expect more relative damage in WoD with the reduced amount of cc?<br>
We&apos;re reducing crit damage done to players by 25% (i.e. crits do 150% damage against players). Damage will be more consistent. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439223761695301632))<br>
<br>
The blog doesn&apos;t mention abilities that break CC, which is significantly more powerful (Lichborne, Fear Ward, TT, BRage..)<br>
In a world where we have too much CC and we&apos;re trying to tip the balance away, I can&apos;t see going after breaks as aggressively. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439226844684894209))<br>
What about mechanics like subterfuge/dematerialize? Those are really bad mechanics..<br>
Subterfuge no longer leaves the rogue in stealth but provides the rogue access to stealth abilities. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439227333027713025))<br>
Will there be changes to all the root breaks that melee have now that they all share a DR and we have less instants?<br>
Certainly concerned about all the root breaks. We haven&apos;t arrived at exactly what we want there yet.<br>
What about interrupts? Skull bash/rebuke staying?<br>
Interrupts are staying. We think their gameplay is more interesting than blanket silences. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439229755397656576))<br>
If interrupts dont have globalCD &amp; casters dont cast a lot,then I disagree.Its just random, no-skill<br>
Our other changes will mean a lot more casting, fewer instants. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439240084315836416))<br>
Will Interrupts remain off the GCD?<br>
Yes, that&apos;s just a gameplay feel issue. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439231036489076736))<br>
<br>
Confused about &quot;Removed Silence effects from interrupts.&quot; No more 3s lockout on kick?<br>
No more silence on counterspell, spear hand strike, silencing shot, etc. Things that added a silence to an interrupt. But a spell that is specifically a silence, like, well Silence, isn&apos;t going away. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439227473545289729))<br>
So no more blanket silence as a CC unless Spriest?<br>
There are others like Strangulate. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439227615031738368))<br>
Short silence, or wait for a cast for a longer interrupt. how is that not a choice?<br>
Disagree. It feels like people more often use it to silence and the lock out ends up as a bonus. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439235918369538048))<br>
What about the &quot;Spell locks&quot;? Will Wind Shear still have a 2 sec lockout and will CS keep it&apos;s X secs?<br>
Yeah, interrupts still lockout the interrupted spell school for X sec. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439240454584819713))<br>
<br>
Are you going to do some kind of pass with the goal of equalizing CC is some way? IE: Each class has like 1-2 CC spells?<br>
Some classes will have more control than others. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439232093004902400))<br>
<br>
Are PvP set bonuses going to be reworked? I think it would be cool if they were really interesting like PvE bonuses.<br>
Probably. Some classes rely on their set bonuses more than others. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439232688034033664))<br>
<br>
With the stat squish, number retuning, and CC changes are you looking to make PVP fights overall longer or shorter?<br>
We&apos;d like to see people rotting and healers having to triage more. No one likes 100-0 gameplay.<br>
So overall it would take longer to die/kill someone, but it is also much harder to heal someone back to full?<br>
That would be the goal (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439234032140701696))<br>
<br>
Classes<br>
Regarding removing CDs, which is likely gonna be cut for Ferals Berserk or Tiger Fury or both?<br>
Both of those are staying. Tiger&apos;s Fury is on the border between feeling like a DPS cooldown and a rotational button. Keeping it because it has significant impact on your rotation; good gameplay. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439222611113816064))<br>
<br>
So the 197 of CJL&apos;s damage (6 * (197 + 1[1.2] * Attack power * 0.386) is going away?<br>
Correct, no more base damage on spells. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439223885020409857))<br>
<br>
Does &quot;One type of ability that we focused on removing is temporary power buffs (aka &quot;cooldowns&quot;)&quot; mean hero/lust/windfury/etc?<br>
We&apos;re keeping Bloodlust/Heroism as the only raid-wide throughput cooldown. No more Stormlash/SkullBanner. Time Warp, Ancient Hysteria stay. We count those all as the same thing, just different sources of the same buff.(Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439227212886061056))<br>
When are we getting those changed from Haste to Amp? Makes much better sense as raid cooldown<br>
Based on our experiments with the SoO trinkets, we&apos;re holding off on doing Amp and Cleave as stats, at least for now. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439230067424522241))<br>
Plans for a different new secondary to take its place then? DPS could use more options. (I know readiness+multistrike)<br>
Crit/Haste/Mastery/Readiness/Multistrike. We think 5 is enough for now. Will make sure none are terrible. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439232095987060736))<br>
<br>
What of the Raid Wide CDs, other than Bloodlust, like devotion aura?<br>
Defensive cooldowns stay. May tweak them of course, but as a concept they stay. Only offensive one will be Bloodlust (etc). (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439234751447056384))<br>
Wait, the ONLY offensive cooldown will be Hero/BL/etc? Every other one is gone?<br>
No, only *raid-wide* offensive cooldown is Bloodlust. I&apos;m referring to removing Stormlash and Skull Banner. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439237419150225408))<br>
<br>
I&apos;m worried that class flavour spells are going to vanish. Things that don&apos;t take up keybind space, like Enslave Demon/Undead.<br>
We&apos;re less concerned about removing those (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439228213382758400))<br>

What about Silence/Counter Shot for Hunters. How will you go about changing these?<br>
Counter Shot stays, Silencing Shot goes (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439228078460383232))<br>
<br>
NS Clone/PoM poly gone is a good change. Wyvern Sting gone as well I presume?<br>
Wyvern is still available. Hunters have had other changes to their CC (Silencing Shot gone for example). (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439229359887364097))<br>
<br>
With all incap sharing DR will scatter and trap now DR w/ each other? How will hunters land traps?<br>
Scatter Shot is gone. Traps arm and activate instantly. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439231766566424576))<br>
&quot;arms and active instantly&quot;? Does that mean it can be fired at a person directly to be trapped? No luncher<br>
No, it has to be placed and has a travel time. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439234196326727680))<br>

How will combustion work in relation to the new &quot;dynamic&quot; dots? Popping CDs just to have them be meaningless after<br>
Combustion is based on the damage of the Ignite, so will not dynamically change. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439219906534330368))<br>
<br>
Re pet-cast CC: Freeze going away? If so, room for a non-CC replacement?<br>
Water Elemental Freeze is staying. However, there is a minor talent that teaches Squirt a new spell that shares a cooldown with it (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439223059434582016))<br>

The blog post implies that Charge is going to be changed to a root after all?<br>
Yes Charge will become a root. Our stance was we liked that change, but 5.4.7 wasn&apos;t the right time to do it. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439228545227706368))<br>
Will Warbringer still add a stun? That will be the only choice for PVP, jumping charges with Freedom/druid shifting/windwalk totem<br>
Yes, Warbringer will be a short stun off DR. Players will be able to get the same behavior with a talent. <br>
Warbringer stun off of DR seems counter to the idea that all stuns share a DR.<br>
There are a number things with very short duration that do not share DR. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439234846695497728))<br>
Clarify very short? Heard warbringer will be a 3 second stun. Also presume they DR with themselves? (warbringer rotations in RBGs)<br>
Basically baseline charge, 1.5 seconds. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439236114155462656))<br>
Charge should remain as is change the talents instead!<br>
We like the added mobility that the talents give, but charge stun every 12 seconds is too much. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439231555035074560))</div></div>
