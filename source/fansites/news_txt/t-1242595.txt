Mailing Heirlooms to Other Realms
Ok so hierloomsthink thats how you spell itcan not be sent to other servers now the idea behinde these is to help people lv new chars faster right so why cant you send these to other realms,seriously blizz most ppl would like to be able to send them to other realms.This is a small issue that would make a massive difference to alot of people
So, in case we can put this topic to rest...

Regarding the ability to send heirlooms cross-realms, please be aware that it's highly unlikely it'll be implemented during Mists of Pandaria as there're numerous technical hurdles that need to be overcome first in order to happen. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Brawler's Guild Cooldowns
We are happy with the way cooldowns currently work for abilities in the Brawler’s Guild. Most of them should reset by the time the next fight begins Yes, not all do but most fall into this category. Right now we don’t want to expand what types of content are given the free temporary respec and cooldown resets. Adding these to an element of PvE might lead to a slippery slope.

Um, most 5+ minute cooldowns as well as all battle rez's reset after a raid boss dies or wipes you, as well as killing a boss clearing sated. Its already in PvE. And frankly for a good reason, sitting around waiting for cooldowns isn't fun nor does it add anything
With short queues, it's understandable that this can be frustrating. As it populates though, you shouldn't really notice it. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

No Dec 25th Maintenance
Right now there are no plans for maintenance tomorrow. Obviously if something comes up, that could change. If that happens, we'll post something here on the forums. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Classes
Players quick to assume balance drives class %s. After looking at 8 years of data, we don't think it's a major factor. Source 

One of the reasons they have a hard time being objective is that switching costs to another class are very high.
Agree that switching to a new class is tough. Swapping specs is less so and IMO players often overestimate the need to. Source 

You mentioned in the recent pod cast that There are more ret pallies than rogues. Does that mean Rogue buffs or Ret nerfs?
We think kit, fun, visuals, doing something special and flexibility are probably bigger drivers. Source 
Then what does your data say about the Lock, Mage, War population right now?
None have changed appreciably since MoP launch. Source 

i just want to let you know that i stopped playing wow from now because frost dk are op
Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but to be fair that's not one I hear a lot lately. Source 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Hey GC, is the Blood DK Tier 14 4 Piece bonus not supposed to boost blood shield, or is that a bug? Thanks. 
It is intended to in this case, not for every +heal. Should have been fixed in 5.1. Source 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
You say you want talent options for PvP, yet every Hunter has Silencing Shot, Blink Strike, and Glaive Toss.
Silencing is too good vs. the alternatives. The Glaive Toss problem is that Power Shot isn't reliable enough. Can fix both. Source 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
How you feel about firemages losing there raid spots after recent hotfixes
Haven't seen it happen. Some mages are able to try Arcane and Frost now though. Source 

You said "come back in a week and we will see how mages are", and yes, firemages are bottom :P
Not seeing Fire on bottom. Happy where Fire is so far. Many mages trying Arcane and Frost, skewing results of sites like raidbots. Source 
10 man normal: 45,366 parses for Fire, 12,702 for Arcane, 9,776 for Frost. 22,478 are the only good mages?
That's size not bias. Bias is Frost jumping 10K or whatever with no buffs. That means the # for Frost before was not accurate. Source 

Tweetered you a few days ago, not nagging but... please take another look at combustion, it's hardly worth casting anymore.
Off the GCD + free damage... hmmm. Source 

change to onuse trinket CD will allow mages with 2 on use trinkets to have 1 available for every single deep freeze. intended?
Smaller burst every 30s is easier to survive than a larger burst every 60s. Humans have to give up the not-nerfed proc trinket. Source 
honestly think mages would be fine if you got rid of the glyph that let them explode their own frost bombs
Yeah, also on the list. Risk might be that Frost Bomb never does damage. Source 
BTW, why does Frost Bomb have special dispel rules, when other class DoTs such as Devouring Plague do not? Hypocrisy.
Having variety in spells isn't the typical definition of hypocrisy. Source 

After almost a full weeks raiding do you feel fire mage damage is where it should be or have they been hit a bit too hard?
We're happy with it at the high end. Looking to make sure less geared Fire mages didn't drop too much. Source 

This week since the hotfix fire has twice as many parses than Frost and Arcane combined, how would that skew the results?
Look at Arcane's curve leap skyward. Now considered they were not buffed. Source 
Your reply implies that min/max moved to Arcane. Those outliers alone don't explain why median numbers for Fire fell so much.
We def nerfed Fire. That was the intent. Just trying to explain that 22nd out of 24 is hyperbole or not reading data well. Source 
Does this look like hyperbole to you?  the sudden dropoff dec 4
Change that chart to just Fire and Frost. Source 
Why not be transparent and make a reporting site w/ your data? Arguments can actually be solved with fact
Data isn't the problem. Raidbots, World of Logs etc have tons. Analysis is the challenge. Source 
Do you know what "median" means?
Yes. I also know what sampling bias means. Source 
thus ANY change on RaidBots is exaggerated due to sampling bias and not always reflective of expected performance
Yes. It doesn't mean the data are useless. It just means you need to be careful. Raidbots site even states that down below. Source 

Arcane received a buff Mana cost reduction and boost to damage per stack Made haste>mastery until high iLevel
That was in 5.1. Arcane jumped since the Fire nerf. Source 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
I enjoy being kiled in 2 sec on my ret paladin,ty for the nerfs they were needed, rets was completely out of control in pvp...
You probably lost 20% max on heals. Was that really what was keeping you alive? Source 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Divine Star seems to be an unpopular talent for priests, maybe you should change the mechanic in a way starfall works
We buffed it recently. Want to see what players do with the new numbers. Source 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
why did you guys remove cataclysm warlock spell since its a good utility, not OP and on top its a dps loss...just curious
It wasn't actually good utility. Melee just stepped away from it until the effect ended. Maybe useful in PvE, but wasn't the goal. Source 

with the "bring the player, not the class" standing why are warlocks still the only class with health stones? Thanks.
We don't think there is much risk of locks being mandatory just for stones. Some differences are good for the game. Source 

I did 10 million less damage this week on H Will from chaos wave. Is there anything to compensate this nerf for PVE?
Just curious - why didn't you use Hand of Gul'dan in those instances? Source 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Charge has 2 charges, only the 1st one seems to grant 20 rage. Nothing about it in the tooltip. Intended ?
Yes. We wanted the talent to be about movement not rage gain. Source 

Reputation / Questing
~ Even putting some gear for gold on Honored and Revered would be fine with most people, I believe.
We moved some pieces down quickly after launch. Would have been interesting to see if response if we had done more. Source 

do you like heirlooms or were they something that was necessary?
We think heirlooms are fun. We don't think they are the only solution to leveling subsequent characters more quickly. Source 

Can we get a little star on the Reputations tab beside Reputations that have been boosted with Grand Commendations?
We want to do something like that. Source 

you keep saying that the old way to gain rep is gone most likely forever. Are we going to see meaningful rep gains anywhere?
Yes, it's possible we will experiment with some - just not chain running dungeons to be done in a day or two. Source 

is there any point in forcing people to be revered with golden lotus to do shado pan dailies?
Didn't want fresh 90s to have to do GL and K and AC and SP and go crazy, then finish in a month and have nothing to do. Source 

Do you want people to be entertained or do you want people to grind? For many the two are mutually exclusive.
Big challenge to MMO dev: players say they want quality but may also unsubscribe if they don't have enough quantity. Source 

Hey Greg, what about brining back tabards, and have all the rep you gain from any/all dailies go towards said faction.
What's the goal there? Just speeding rep up or letting you skip quests you don't like? Source
