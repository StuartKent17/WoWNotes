<br>
This means your item sets will remain just as they are now.<br>
<br>
Also note, to address the feedback we&apos;ve been reading this morning concerning the idea of simply &#x201C;buffing tier 4 and 5 equivalent slots&#x201D;, the reason we do not is because improving those 3 slots for tier 4 and 5 would force a change to all other tier 4 and 5 items as well (weapons, melee sets, everything).<br>
