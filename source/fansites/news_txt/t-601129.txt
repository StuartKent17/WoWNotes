Boubouille2007-03-12, 05:44 AMA short maintenance was done to update/fix the item tooltips and a few other things. The only known problem with the new version is a few color not easy to read should be fixed soon, and I think I saw an item icon not working. 

Oh yeah, the SQL error at the bottom of the articles should be fixed now 8
