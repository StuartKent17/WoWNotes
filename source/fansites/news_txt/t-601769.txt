Boubouille2007-08-21, 10:53 PMWe have a few things in the works that are going to help out a bit. One of those things is that we are going to adjust the rate at which players can level. Another is that we are working on some changes for Dustwallow Marsh which should give players in that zone more to do and make leveling go quicker as well.

We'll reveal more of our plans as we get a bit closer toward actually implementing them. I just don't have a specific time table that I can give you as of yet.

Oh, I assure you, there is more than just a singular quest being added. Detailed quests, I couldn't give you.
