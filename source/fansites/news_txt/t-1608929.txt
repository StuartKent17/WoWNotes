Gearing Up Alts
If you want to gear up alts to make leveling in Warlords a little bit easier, there are now a few more ways to do so. Keep in mind that lots of items can be upgraded at the cost of 50 x Lesser Charm of Good Fortune http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/738-lesser-charm-of-good-fortune.


Upper Blackrock Spire - The new version of UBRS drops item level 550 blues ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=550&filter-ilvl-max=550&filter-reqlvl-min=90&filter-reqlvl-max=90&filter-quality=8&filter-slot=2359278, which is better than you can get from Normal Siege of Orgrimmar without upgrades. You need item level 510 to queue.
Honor - Battlegrounds and arena skirmishes can give you honor to purchase item level 550 Prideful gear http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=550&filter-ilvl-max=550.
Gold - Gear that was sold for Justice or Valor previously is now sold for gold!

Item Level 522 - If you have the required rep with the Shado-Pan Assault, you can grab this item level 522 gear http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-req-faction-1=1435&filter-req-faction-2=1&filter-ilvl-min=522&filter-ilvl-max=522.
Item Level 496 - Tuskripper Grukna http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/69060-tuskripper-grukna H and Agent Malley http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/69059-agent-malley A from Patch 5.1 sell some 496 items that may be of use.
Item Level 489 - Commander Oxheart http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/64606-commander-oxheart sells lots of 489 gear.

Timeless Isle - You can get lots of 496 gear from chests on the isle http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1328815-In-depth-Timeless-Isle-Hidden-Chest-Guide!. If you get tokens for armor you don't need, you can send them to other alts.
World Bosses - The world bosses have a 15-30% chance to drop gear. Don't forget Ordos is now accessible to everyone. 
Siege of Orgrimmar - Flex is now normal and scales from 10 to 30, so take advantage of the Group Finder to get some gear. If you are item level 496 or above, you can get item level 528 gear from Raid Finder.
Throne of Thunder - If you are at least item level 480, you can do Throne of Thunder. Bosses have a ~30% chance to drop item level 502 gear.
