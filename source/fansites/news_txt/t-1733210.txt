Shadowmeld Bug
Shadowmeld's Night Elf racial functionality received a bug fix in Patch 6.1 to address a number of issues with the ability that wound up affecting its behavior in PvP combat. A hotfix is being worked on it's not ready yet that will restore Shadowmeld back to the way it worked while keeping the bug fixes intact. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/364344-shadowmeld-still-not-fixed/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16528042667?page=1#14

Shadowmeld Bug
Don't you usually put bug fixes in the patch notes? You know, under the big Bug Fixes section, why wasn't Shadowmeld mentioned? Legitimately interested.
In that particular instance, the change was to make Shadowmeld work more consistently like Vanish or Invisibility where a number of bugs got fixed with those abilities. It was not anything that would be noticed or warrant a patch note because it was intended to not affect how the ability worked. 

Update: The hotfix to return Shadowmeld back to it's pre-6.1 functionality after tomorrow's rolling restarts should be going in later tonight.

Patch 6.1 Undocumented Changes
Offloading some of the information I've been tracking down in no particular order.

Regarding Paladin's Hammer of Wrath concerns, I've verified that it was only a tooltip update in Patch 6.1 and there were no further changes to the ability. Also, the ability does not and should not be benefiting from Sword of Light as it's not a melee attack.

I noticed that Find Weakness for sub rogues has been nerfed in pvp for 6.1. Before the patch It was at 100% armor bypass now its at 50%, this change has only affected pvp. This was not posted in the patch notes.
Tooltip for the ability Find Weakness stated that it "Bypasses less armor on players.". Additionally, the ability itself no longer exists as of Patch 6.0.2 back on October 15, 2014.

Rogue - http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/15682579#rogue
Find Weakness’ effects have been merged into baseline Ambush, Garrote, and Cheap Shot for Subtlety Rogues.
I Understand we want blizzard to be more open about stuff. But lets be honest it might sometimes be hard or insane to document every single little tweak ever. So trying to nitpick every little bit of something even with something that doesnt really affect gameplay in anyway other than aesthetics. lets not try to be too nit picky and just help blizzard understand where were coming from.
Thanks, I've been trying to investigate credible claims. A number of purported inaccuracies were actually noted in the patch notes or hotfix blog.

Re: Shadowmeld, Cretch appears to be referring to this: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16528042667

Looks like it doesn't drop combat in 6.1. Is that just PVP Cretch or everywhere?
The Shadowmeld's Night Elf racial functionality received a bug fix to address a number of issues with the ability that wound up affecting its behavior in PvP combat. We're working on a hotfix that's undergoing testing but not ready to be implemented yet that will restore Shadowmeld back to the way it worked while keeping the bug fixes intact.

Gladiator's sanctum work orders got stealth nerfed to be 20 bones per order instead of 10 when WoD launched

Show me your patch notes on that
Got clarification on that one, thanks for bringing it to my attention. The change has been updated in the 6.1 Patch Notes.

Gladiator's Sanctum
Work Orders for Gladiator's Sanctum shipments now cost 20 Broken Bones up from 10. Additionally, shipments now award less gold but increased the chance of receiving an item or bonus Honor Points.

Any plans to fix the 2-6 sec delay on Execution Sentence in PvP? really kills the talent. Holy, used as a heal
We don't see this internally. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/572471416307654657

Seems like the DRs for CC are now always 15 seconds rather than 15-20, feels like a huge buff for comps like RMD. intended change?
It is intended that it always resets after a fixed amount of time, but it should be 18 seconds; we'll get this fixed. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/572475810625421312
15 sec DR been the case since WoD release. Keep that in mind,to understand what classes you're about to nerf
No, it was fixed to be more exact in 6.1 holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/572481692444672000
20sec cd, 4sec duration, must have been 16sec DR the highest at all times.
It was somewhere between 15 and 15.4 seconds. It will now be 18 and 18.4 seconds. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/572482319849660416

how are you guys feeling about RBG mmr? #1 player hasn't changed in months due to deflation. HotH/HotA 2102 rating
More players per team and longer matches results in less games played, and lower ratings compared to other brackets. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/572472974734856192
I guess even less player will play RBG now due to the recent mmr changes. who wants to spend years for 2k

<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/overwatchmini.png" style="margin-bottom:-2px; margin-right:0px; vertical-align:bottom" /> Overwatch Interviews
Another Overwatch interview http://www.overpwn.com/news/32-pax-east-playerscut-yes-no-interview-overwatch provided some new information today. An interesting official response to the question of having a Field of View setting also came up again http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2yi4yx/blizzards_stance_on_fov_in_their_upcoming_fps/:


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/march/paxOVInterview.png www.overpwn.com/news/32-pax-east-playerscut-yes-no-interview-overwatch 

FOV is definitely an important element of many shooters, including Overwatch. For clarity, Overwatch currently has a fixed vertical FOV of 60. This means that at 16:9 which most players use, you'll have a horizontal FOV of about 92.

To answer the "will there/won't there" question directly, though, there are no plans at this time to implement an FOV slider to the game. The rationale here is that we want to avoid creating a situation of "Haves and Have-Nots," where those who are aware of the slider are able to gain an advantage over those who aren't. Instead, we'd rather develop towards a unified FOV that feels good across the board. Aiming preferences, viewmodels, dizziness, nausea—these are all factors we considered when designing the current FOV and will remain sensitive and very open to as testing continues.

Hope that helps!
