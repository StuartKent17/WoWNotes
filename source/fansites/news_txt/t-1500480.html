Warlords of Draenor Alpha Official Notes Update<br>
<br>
Game System Changes<br>
<br>
Stat Squish<br>
We&apos;ve also streamlined the multitude of various types of Haste % and Crit % bonuses.<br>
<br>
Spell Haste %, Melee Haste %, and Ranged Haste % have been merged into a universal Haste %.<br>
Spell Crit %, Melee Crit %, and Ranged Crit % have been merged into a universal Crit %.<br>
<br>
<br>
Itemization Changes (New Section)<br>
We&#x2019;re making a number of changes to itemization based on a single philosophy: We want to increase the chance that any given item drop is useful to someone in your group.To support this philosophy we&#x2019;re making a few changes to stats. Most items found in Draenor will work for all specializations within a given class, so that you never have to grumble when you see, for example, Intellect plate drop in a group that lacks a Holy Paladin.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re also reducing the number of role-specific stats: Hit and Expertise are gone, as are Dodge and Parry as stats on items, replaced with a single tank stat of Bonus Armor. Armor and Spirit will be specific to tanks and healers respectively, but all other secondary stats will have universal appeal.<br>
<br>
Because of the magnitude of this change, we&#x2019;re retroactively applying this philosophy to items in Mists of Pandaria. After the pre-expansion patch you may find that some of your items contribute different stats, but they should still be good for your class.<br>
<br>
General<br>
<br>
New secondary stats added:<br>
<br>
Bonus Armor: Increases armor.<br>
Multistrike: Grants a chance for spells and abilities to fire an additional time, at 30% effectiveness (both damage and healing).<br>
Readiness: Reduces the cooldown of several class abilities with long-cooldowns.<br>
<br>
Hit and Expertise on all items have been replaced with a universally useful secondary stat.<br>
Stats that are not useful to your current class specialization will be grayed out in the tooltip rather than green, and will not be counted on your character stat sheet.<br>
<br>
Spirit for non-healing specializations<br>
Bonus Armor for non-tanking specializations<br>
Strength for Agility/Intellect-users<br>
Agility for Strength/Intellect-users<br>
Intellect for Strength/Agility-users<br>
For example, Intellect on a cloak will be greyed out for all Warrior specializations and they will not receive an increase to Intellect if equipped. However, if the same cloak is equipped by a Mage, Intellect will show up as green and they&#x2019;ll receive the increase to their Intellect.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mists of Pandaria and Future Items<br>
<br>
Dodge and Parry have been replaced with Bonus Armor. If an item had both Dodge and Parry on it, it has been replaced with an additional useful secondary stat.<br>
Head, Chest, Hand, Wrist, Waist, Leg, Feet, Weapon, Shield, and Off-hand items that had tanking stats (Dodge, Parry) or healer stats (Spirit) have been replaced with a different universally useful secondary stat.<br>
<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor Items<br>
<br>
Plate Armor pieces will always have Strength and Intellect on it.<br>
Mail and Leather Armor pieces will always have Agility and Intellect on it.<br>
<br>

<br>
Crowd Control and Diminishing Returns<br>
Additionally, we&apos;ve significantly reduced the number of throughput-increasing cooldowns and procs, in order to further reduce burst damage. Please keep in mind when reading the specifics of the patch notes that some classes may have lost abilities, or had the power of select abilities reduced. These changes were made in the context of the above goals. Other classes have a reduced crowd-control ability overall. We believe that this entire package of changes will make PvP a more enjoyable experience for everyone.<br>

<br>
Movement Speed (New Section)<br>
Moving quickly has always been a powerful bonus in World of Warcraft; however, the logic of how various movement speed bonuses stack (or don&apos;t) has generally been inconsistent and poorly explained. Under the old set-up, each movement speed bonus would become more powerful when combined with another, so we would limit what can stack with what, and prevent certain abilities from being used when another one is already in effect. We decided to change the movement speed system to make it more transparent, with rules about stacking that are easier to understand, and with fewer restrictions.<br>
<br>
Previously, multiple movement speed modifiers on you were multiplicative, meaning that if you had two different +25% movement speed bonuses, they resulted in a total movement speed of 56% (1.25*1.25 = 1.56).<br>
<br>
Movement speed bonuses have been changed to be additive. The previous example with two different +25% movement speed bonuses would result in a total movement speed of +50%. The logic governing which bonuses stack with others has been simplified as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
If a bonus is self-only and passive, it now stacks additively with everything.<br>
If a bonus is temporary or applies to other players, it&apos;s considered exclusive, and the character only gains the benefit of the highest exclusive bonus.<br>
<br>
<br>
Additionally, restrictions that prevented a player with a temporary speed bonus from receiving or activating a second temporary speed bonus have been removed. Both bonuses will now apply to the character, but only the one with the highest magnitude will have any effect.<br>
<br>
Examples of self-only passive bonuses: Cat Form, Movement Speed enchants, Quickness racial for Night Elves, Unholy Presence<br>
<br>
<br>
These will all stack additively with each other.<br>
<br>
<br>
Examples of shared or temporary bonuses: Angelic Feather, Sprint, Stampeding Roar<br>
<br>
<br>
All of these effects can now be applied simultaneously, but only the strongest one will have an effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
Raid Utility Balance (New Section)<br>
Various classes bring various abilities that provide utility to parties and raids. We talked about one type of utility in the Buffs and Debuffs section, above. However, there are other types of raid utility, and it&#x2019;s been in need of more attention. In general, raid utility, especially raid-wide defensive cooldowns, had grown too strong. So many classes and specializations had defensive cooldowns that we had to make raid damage extremely high, as raids would be stacking or chaining together multiple cooldowns. We&apos;d like to return to a system where it&apos;s the healers who heal through the scary moments, not the damage dealers, for example.<br>
<br>
To do so, we&#x2019;ve established a new baseline level of raid utility that a specialization should bring, and brought everyone to that new standard by reducing the effects of some abilities, or removing some abilities altogether.<br>

<br>
<br>
Periodic Effects (New Section)<br>
There are many effects in the game which deal periodic damage over time (DoT) or healing over time (HoT). Historically, these have typically done something called &#x201C;snapshotting&#x201D;; they were based on your stats at the time that they were cast, and that was used for calculating their effect for their full lifetime. In Mists, if a warlock casts Corruption on an enemy while Heroism is active, that DoT will continue to tick rapidly based on the temporary haste effect, even after Heroism fades. This has led to some gameplay that has both good and bad sides.<br>
<br>
Snapshotting encourages refreshing those periodic effects when your stats are high, such as when a temporary buff procs. On the upside, there&apos;s a high amount of skill involved in maximizing that. On the downside, it&apos;s not intuitive, and the skill ceiling is so high that few can reach it without the use of specialized add-ons. To make matters worse, the benefits of maximizing periodic snapshotting is so high that it creates a balance problem. Players maximizing periodic snapshotting (primarily through the use of add-ons) do drastically more damage than intended. If we balance around taking full advantage of snapshotting, then the players who aren&#x2019;t doing so would fall unacceptably far behind in damage output.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, we&apos;ve decided that snapshotting isn&apos;t a productive mechanic for the game. The vast majority of periodic effects in the game that snapshotted no longer do so. The only exceptions are ones that do damage based on a percentage of a previous ability&apos;s damage (such as the Ignite from a Fire Mage&apos;s Fireball, or the periodic damage on a Windwalker Monk&apos;s Blackout Kick), as they inherently act as a delayed damage multiplier to those abilities.Temporary effects which buff the damage or healing of other spells specifically will continue to do so for their lifetime; for example, Unleash Flame (which increases the damage of the shaman&apos;s next fire spell by 40%), when used on a Flame Shock, will continue to increase the damage of the periodic effect for its entire lifetime, despite being consumed when the Flame Shock is cast. We still of course want skills and their use to embody interesting choices, and intelligent and skillful use of abilities.<br>
<br>
<br>
Periodic damage and healing effects now dynamically recalculate their damage, healing, Critical chance, multipliers, and period on every tick.<br>
<br>
<br>
Skilled players will still be able to take advantage of temporary power buffs like trinket procs, and you&apos;ll still want to cast your hardest hitting spells within those proc durations. The benefits just won&apos;t extend outside the trinket procs&#x2019; duration. As such, this high-skill gameplay is there, it&apos;s just rewarded more consistently. For example, a Priest&#x2019;s trinket procs and an already active Shadow Word: Pain will begin dealing more damage the instant the proc effect occurs, but will return to normal when the proc duration ends. Skilled players will be able to play within these proc durations to maximize effect, but it won&#x2019;t be as detrimental to output to anyone who isn&#x2019;t actively and skillfully using them to their full extent.<br>
<br>
We also made another change to periodic effects. Haste has long affected the tick rate of periodic effects, and their duration has been rounded to whole numbers of ticks, in order to mostly preserve the original duration of the spell. This lead to Haste breakpoints where having specific amounts of Haste would cause certain periodic effects to gain an extra tick. Part of gearing your character involved trying to reach those Haste breakpoints, but not go over by too much. This was a fairly tedious number to manage, which was again mostly handled by add-ons and guides. With some new tech we&#x2019;re now able to calculate the effect of Haste on tick time dynamically. Any fraction of a full period left at the end of an effect will do a tick of damage or healing in proportion to the remaining time. In other words, there are no more Haste breakpoints; Haste now smoothly and accurately affects periodic effects for the entire duration.<br>
<br>
This also opened up the opportunity to revise how we handle refreshing periodic effects. For the vast majority of spells and abilities, we had a standard rule that any refresh would add the new cast&apos;s duration after the next tick of the existing effect. In simpler terms, you can refresh anywhere between the last and second-to-last tick of a DoT or HoT with no loss. Warlocks had a special passive that changed this logic to allow refreshing with no loss anywhere in the last 50% of a DoT. We liked the flexibility that this provided; though felt it was a bit too powerful. No longer tied to whole tick times, we chose to extend the mechanic that Warlocks had to all classes, but reduce it to 30%. Everyone can now refresh their periodic effects anywhere in the last 30% of the duration for full benefit, and no lost tick time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Recasting periodic damage over time and healing over time effects that are already on the target now extends those effects to up to 130% of the normal duration of the effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tank Vengeance and Resolve<br>
The changes to tanking made in Mists of Pandaria turned out quite well, overall. But there were a few rough parts that we&apos;re going to smooth over. The biggest one is the offensive capabilities of Vengeance. We like that tanks can provide meaningful DPS to their group, however, it swung wildly based on the fight, even surpassing the dedicated damage dealers occasionally. To solve this, we&apos;re going to remove the offensive value of Vengeance, but preserve the defensive value, by making it increase the effect of your active mitigation buttons, instead of Attack Power.<br>
<br>
Then, to keep tank DPS meaningful, we&apos;ll be raising their damage, since it would be meager with no Vengeance Attack Power (Vengeance accounted for 70-90% of a tank&apos;s damage on high-tank-damage fights in Mists). To do that, we&apos;re increasing the damage of several prominent tank abilities, as well as having tanks also gain increased Attack Power from Mastery, in addition to the stat&#x2019;s existing benefits. That also helps keep secondary stats balanced in offensive value for them.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Quality of Life Improvements<br>
Facing Requirements<br>
Strict facing requirements can be frustrating to deal with, especially in hectic Raid combat or PvP environments. In order to ease this frustration, we decided to remove or significantly loosen the facing requirements of all attacks that required the player to be behind their target.<br>
<br>
<br>
Druid: Ravage no longer requires the Druid to be behind the target.<br>
<br>
<br>
Reforging (New Section)<br>
The original intent behind Reforging was to offer a way for players to customize their gear, but in practice it offered little in the way of true choice. Players attempting to optimize every piece of gear were well advised to look up how they were supposed to reforge an item in an online guide or tool that had already determined the optimal choice. It added yet another step to the list of things that must be done to a new item before it was ready to be equipped, reducing the joy of getting an upgrade into a chore.<br>
<br>
If an upgrade drops, we want you to be able to equip it with a minimum of fuss. It is for those reasons that we&#x2019;re removing Reforging from the game.<br>
<br>
The Reforging system and associated NPCs have been removed from the game.<br>
All existing items that were reforged have been returned to their original un-reforged state.<br>
<br>
<br>
Combat Resurrections (New Section)<br>
Combat resurrections are an extremely powerful tool that players have while in combat. Naturally, we apply some limitations. In Mists of Pandaria, that limit was 1 resurrection during a given raid boss encounter for 10-player modes and 3 for 25-player modes. With Flexible difficulty introduced in Patch 5.4, we erred on the forgiving side, and gave Flexible Raids 3 resurrections regardless of raid size.<br>
<br>
In Warlords of Draenor, the Flex tech has expanded to more difficulty levels, and we needed a new system to handle combat resurrections more fairly. We knew that continuing with a constant 3 would encourage using the smallest possible raid sizes, while scaling with hard breakpoints would discourage specific group sizes just under those points. Additionally, the limit is not shown anywhere in-game, so it can be easy to lose track of how many resurrections the raid has available (or even know that the limit exists).<br>
<br>
So we&#x2019;ve built a new system to be more transparent, and improve usability.<br>
<br>
<br>
During a boss encounter, all combat resurrection spells now share a single raid-wide pool of charges that&#x2019;s visible on the action bar button.<br>
Upon engaging a boss, all combat resurrection spells will have their cooldowns reset and begin with 1 charge. Charges will accumulate at a rate of 1 per (90/RaidSize) minutes.<br>
<br>
Example 1: A 10-player raid will accumulate 1 charge every 9 minutes (90/10 = 9).<br>
Example 2: A 20-player raid will accumulate 1 charge every 4.5 minutes (90/20 = 4.5).<br>
<br>
A charge will only be deducted when a combat resurrection is successful (when the target accepts the resurrection).<br>
Raid frames now show a debuff indicating that a dead player has a pending combat resurrection available.<br>
Outside of raid boss encounters, combat resurrection spells retain their normal cooldown behavior.<br>
<br>
<br>
Glyphs<br>
We made several improvements to the Glyph system. While leveling, characters unlock Glyph slots at several specific levels. However, in order to get glyphs, characters need to visit an Auction House (and potentially pay way more gold than an average character of that level has yet), or know a Scribe from which to request them. To solve this, we&apos;ve made characters learn some Glyphs automatically as they level. Additionally, we now have the ability to make some glyphs exclusive with each other, or require specific specializations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Many glyphs have been removed, and many new glyphs have been added.<br>
Exclusive categories have been added for some glyphs. Other glyphs from the same category cannot be applied at the same time.<br>
Some glyphs are now exclusive to a specialization.<br>
<br>
Professions<br>
<br>
Movement Speed enchants now increase Movement Speed by 10% (up from 8%).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Class Changes<br>
<br>
Death Knight<br>
We removed Dodge and Parry from gear, and expect Blood Death Knights to value Haste and Crit as important secondary stats. In order to achieve that, we made Riposte give defensive value to Critical Strikes, and Scent of Blood give defensive value to Multistrike. auto attack and Rune Strike crits. To solve GCD-capping issues and increase the value of Haste, we also removed the passive rune regeneration increase from Improved Blood Presence. Finally, we tweaked the targeting AI of Dancing Rune Weapon, and fixed it up to properly copy most Talents that you know.<br>
<br>
<br>
Riposte has been redesigned.<br>
<br>
Riposte now gives the Death Knight Parry equal to their Critical Strike bonus from gear. After getting a Critical Strike with an Auto Attack or Rune Strike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56815), you gain +100% Parry chance until you Parry an attack. This can stack up to 2 times.<br>
<br>
Improved Blood Presence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/50371) no longer increases rune regeneration rate.<br>
<br>
<br>
There were also a few other miscellaneous changes. The Runic Power generation of Anti-Magic Shell was standardized, to make it more understandable and balanced. Level-60 and Level-75 talent rows have swapped places, so the important rune regeneration talents could be acquired earlier.<br>
<br>
Level-60 and Level-75 talent rows have swapped places.<br>
<br>
<br>
Druid<br>
Note that Primal Tenacity&apos;s calculation uses the damage before any other absorbs you have, and before Tooth and Claw&apos;s effects, so that it isn&#x2019;t negatively affected by any of those. Note that Primal Tenacity&apos;s calculation uses the damage before any other absorbs you have, and before Tooth and Claw&apos;s effects, so that it isn&#x2019;t negatively affected by any of the changes. We also slightly reduced the power of Primal Fury, in order to better balance secondary stats for Guardians.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tooth and Claw can now accumulate 2 charges, and its effects stack on the target. Its effects are affected by Resolve.<br>
Ursa Major is a new passive ability for Guardian Druids:<br>
<br>
Ursa Major: Multistrikes from auto attacks and Mangle (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/33878) grant the Druid Ursa Major. Ursa Major increases maximum health by 5% for 15 seconds. When this effect is refreshed, the remaining portion is added to the new effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
Feral Druids received one major change, and few tweaks beyond what&apos;s been mentioned above in Ability Pruning and Facing Requirements. Combo Points are now stored &quot;on the player&quot;, meaning that when you switch targets, any accumulated Combo Points remain with you. Pounce was buffed significantly, in order to bring it up to par with Ravage. Primal Fury was changed to let it affect area attacks as well. Glyph of Savagery was reworked to better achieve its intended effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
Combo Points for Feral Druids are now shared across all targets, and are no longer lost when switching targets.<br>
<br>
<br>
Overall, we are happy with Balance&apos;s rotation, however there are a few tweaks coming through Draenor Perks. With the changes to Periodic Effects, we&apos;re slightly modifying Eclipse to allow it to retain the gameplay it had before.<br>
<br>
<br>
Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577) now increases the damage of all Nature spells (or Arcane, depending on which Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577) state is active) cast while it is active. This means that for example: a Moonfire (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8921) cast during Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577) will receive the Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577) benefit through its whole duration, even after leaving Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577). The reverse also holds true; a Moonfire (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8921) cast before entering Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577) will not benefit from that Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577) until it is recast.<br>
<br>
<br>
And the Druid changes are capped off by merging Glyph of Stampede&apos;s effects into Glyph of Stampeding Roar.<br>
<br>
Glyph of Stampede (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/40906) has been removed. Its effects have been merged into Glyph of Stampeding Roar (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/45604).<br>
<br>
<br>
Hunter<br>
We did a comprehensive pass on Hunter pet abilities. As mentioned above in Crowd Control and Diminishing Returns, all full crowd-control abilities have been removed from Hunter pets and replaced those with new abilities, including spreading some that were previously restricted to exotic pets. Additionally, Hunters can now tame beasts from new pet families.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hunters may now tame beasts from 3 new pet families.<br>
<br>

The following pet families also provide an additional ability.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
There were also a few other changes, primarily for quality of life and rotational consistency.<br>
<br>
<br>
Aimed Shot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/19434) now deals 20% more damage and can be cast while moving. no longer interrupts Auto Attacks.<br>
Growl (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/6795) now has a 30-yard range.<br>
Several raid buffs provided by pets have been changed into auras that are automatically applied to the Hunter&apos;s party or raid.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mage<br>
In order to solve all of these problems, we decided to merge the 3 current Bomb Talents into one that changes based on spec. That allows us to reintroduce spec-specific perks to each Bomb, and makes room for some non-DoT alternatives.<br>
<br>
<br>
Frost Bomb (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/113092) has been redesigned. It now lasts 12 seconds, has no cooldown, and explodes every time the target is critically hit by the Mage&apos;s Ice Lance (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/30455) while frozen. The damage per explosion has been reduced by 75% to compensate.<br>
Glyph of Mirror Image (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/45739) has been removed and its effects have been incorporated into Mirror Image (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/55342).<br>
Glyph of Frostfire Bolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/44684) is now available only to Fire Mages.<br>
<br>
<br>
Monk<br>
<br>
Stance of the Spirited Crane is a new ability for Mistweaver Monks, which replaces Stance of the Fierce Tiger (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/103985).<br>
<br>
The Spell-Power-to-Attack-Power Conversion (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/119975) effect has been moved from Stance of the Wise Serpent (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115070) to Stance of the Spirited Crane.<br>
The Eminence effect has been moved from Stance of the Wise Serpent (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115070) to Stance of the Spirited Crane.<br>
<br>
Eminence now a nearby target to be healed for 35% of all damage caused by the Monk and includes auto attacks.<br>
<br>
Serpent&apos;s Zeal has been removed. Eminence now always includes Auto Attacks.<br>
Muscle Memory, Serpent&apos;s Zeal, and Vital Mists have been replaced with a new passive ability, Crane Style Techniques. Crane Style Techniques enhances several of the Monk&apos;s combat abilities while in Crane Stance. merged. Muscle Memory now requires Stance of the Spirited Crane, and passively increases the damage of Crackling Jade Lightning (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/117952) by 100%, causes Tiger Palm (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100787) to trigger the Vital Mists effect, and causes Blackout Kick (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100784) to hit 4 additional nearby targets for 50% damage.<br>
<br>
Crackling Jade Lightning (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/117952) channels 150% faster, generates 1 Chi each time it deals damage, but costs 300% more mana.<br>
Blackout Kick (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100784) grants Crane&apos;s Zeal, increasing Critical Strike chance by 20% for 20 seconds.<br>
Blackout Kick (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100784) causes Eminence to heal 5 allies instead of 1, but heals for only 15% of damage dealt instead of 35%.<br>
The Monk gains a stack of Vital Mists for every Chi consumed.<br>
<br>
Rising Sun Kick (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/107428) is now available to Mistweaver and Windwalker Monks. However, it does not cause Mortal Wounds for Mistweavers.<br>
<br>
The Windwalker passive ability, Combat Conditioning (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/128595), now causes Rising Sun Kick (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/107428) to cause Mortal Wounds, instead of causing Mortal Wounds naturally.<br>
<br>
The following abilities now require Stance of the Spirited Crane for Mistweavers:<br>
<br>
Blackout Kick (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100784), Jab (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100780), Rising Sun Kick (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/107428), Tiger Palm (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100787)<br>
<br>
<br>
We also did some polishing on Brewmasters and Windwalkers and made Storm, Earth, and Fire, Transcendence, and Touch of Death easier to use. Fists of Fury has also been improved; sometimes brute force is the right answer. Gift of the Ox was changed to give value to the new Multistrike stat for Brewmasters. Lastly, Tiger Strikes was improved considerably, and made available to all Monk specializations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Gift of the Ox (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/124502) now has a chance to trigger only from auto attack Multistrikes, instead of from all auto attacks. It has a 100% chance to trigger while using a two-handed weapon, and a 62.5% chance to trigger while dual wielding.<br>
Fists of Fury (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/113656) now deals 100% increased damage, and always deals full damage to your primary target; additional targets are still affected by the damage split.<br>
Tiger Strikes (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/120272) is now available to all Monk specializations, and has a chance to trigger on successful auto attacks and their Multistrikes. It has an 8% chance to trigger while using a two-handed weapon, and a 5% chance to trigger while dual wielding.<br>
<br>
When triggered, Tiger Strikes (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/120272) now grants +50% Multistrike for 8 seconds instead of +50% attack speed and double attacks for 4 attacks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Paladin<br>
We made several changes for Holy, to go along with other larger system changes to compensate for the removal of Guardian of Ancient Kings from Holy, and merged its benefits into Divine Favor. In order to follow through on our change to merge all types of Haste %, we removed the Spell Haste % from Seal of Insight to a Holy-only passive, so that it didn&apos;t also increase Protection&apos;s baseline Haste by 10%. Our changes to healer mana and mobility also indirectly increased the value of Selfless Healer by a large amount, so we brought it back down to be even in power with the other talents on its row. We also raised the range of Denounce to be consistent with other spells.<br>
<br>
<br>
Infusion of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53576) now also passively increases Haste by 10%.<br>
Seal of Insight (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20165) no longer increases spell Haste by 10%.<br>
Selfless Healer (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/85804) for Holy no longer causes Judgment (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20271) to grant Holy Power. It also is only usable on Flash of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/19750), no longer on Holy Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/635) or Holy Radiance (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/82327).<br>
<br>
<br>
For Protection, we tweaked Eternal Flame in order to reduce its massive self-healing amount, and provide better balance between talents on that row. We also added a new passive, Shining Protector, in order to give defensive value to the new Multistrike stat.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bastion of Glory no longer affects the periodic healing of Eternal Flame (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114163). It still affects the direct healing portion of the ability.<br>
Shining Protector is a new passive ability for Protection Paladins.<br>
<br>
Shining Protector: All heals you receive have a chance equal to your Multistrike chance to trigger Shining Protector, healing you for an additional 30% of the triggering heal.<br>
<br>
Eternal Flame (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114163) now deals 100% of the direct healing of Word of Glory (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/85673) (up from 70%), but only 50% as much periodic healing as before. Additionally, Bastion of Glory no longer affects the periodic healing.<br>
<br>
<br>
We made a few additional changes to Paladins. We revised the functionality of Hammer of the Righteous a bit, such that its performance is about the same, but its tooltip is much clearer. We also made Stay of Execution much more attractive to use as an emergency button. One big change for Retribution that isn&apos;t mentioned here is the removal of Inquisition (see Ability Pruning), which will have a notable effect on their rotation.<br>
<br>
Priest<br>
<br>
Angelic Feather (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/121536), if cast on players, will always prefer the casting priest over others, then pick the player closest to the targeted location. If there are no players where it is targeted, it will still create a feather that can be picked up, as before. Additionally, when collecting multiple feathers, the duration will be extended instead of replaced; up to a maximum of 130% of base duration.<br>
Inner Focus (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/89485): No longer provides immunity to Dispels, Interrupts, and Silence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/15487). This effect will be returning as a Major Glyph.<br>
Purify (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/527), Halo (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/120517), Cascade (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/121148), and Divine Star (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/110745) can now be cast while in Spirit of Redemption (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20711) form.<br>
Shadowfiend (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/34433) no longer restores mana.<br>
<br>
Mindbender (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/123040) now restores 0.75% mana per hit (down from 1.75%).<br>
<br>
<br>
Rogue<br>
There are a number of Rogue changes listed under Ability Pruning, but there are a few additional changes to note. The biggest of which is a fundamental change to how Combo Points work. They&apos;re now shared across all enemies; you can swap targets and you won;t lose your Combo Points.<br>
<br>
<br>
Combo Points for Rogues are now shared across all targets. You no longer lose your Combo Points when switching targets.<br>
<br>
<br>
Shaman<br>
In Warlords of Draenor, we&apos;re pulling back on the ability for many casters to deal damage while moving, and that includes Elemental. They will still have some ability to deal damage while moving, through Shocks, Unleash Weapon, and instant Lava Bursts. For Chain Lightning, we wanted to reduce the impact of Haste soft capping, and so changed Shamanism to increase damage instead of reduce cast time. Additionally, we simplified Wind Shear by removing its impact on threat, which no longer matters.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ascendance (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114049) for the Enhancement specialization now changes the Shaman&apos;s auto attacks and Stormstrike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/17364) to deal Wind-based physical damage that bypasses armor.<br>
Earthquake (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/61882) damage has been increased by 36%.<br>
Echo of the Elements (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108283) has been redesigned. The Shaman&apos;s spells and abilities have a chance to trigger Echo of the Elements (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108283), causing their next short-cooldown spell or ability to not trigger a cooldown.<br>
<br>
Elemental: It may be used on Earth Shock (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8042), Flame Shock (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8050), Frost Shock (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8056), Earthquake (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/61882), or Lava Burst (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/51505).<br>
Enhancement: It may be used on Earth Shock (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8042), Flame Shock (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8050), Frost Shock (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8056), Fire Nova (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/1535), Lava Lash (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/60103), or Stormstrike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/17364).<br>
Restoration: It may be used on Healing Rain (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/73920), Purify Spirit (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/77130), or Riptide (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/61295).<br>
<br>
Using Unleashed Fury (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/117012) with Windfury Weapon (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8232) imbue active now increases Multistrike chance by 10%.<br>
<br>
<br>
Warrior<br>
<br>
Sudden Death (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/29725) can no longer trigger from Opportunity Strike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/76858).<br>
<br>
<br>
Protection Warriors have received a few notable changes. First, we removed Dodge and Parry from gear, and expect Protection Warriors to value Haste and Crit as important secondary stats. In order to achieve that, we made Riposte give defensive value to Crits. The aforementioned Headlong Rush also helps for valuing Haste.<br>
<br>
<br>
Blood Craze is a new passive ability for Protection Warriors.<br>
<br>
Blood Craze causes Multistrike auto attacks to trigger a Blood Craze, which regenerates 3% of the Warrior&apos;s health over 3 seconds. When this effect is refreshed, the remaining duration is added to the new effect.<br>
<br>
Riposte has been redesigned.<br>
<br>
Riposte now gives the Warrior Parry equal to their Critical Strike bonus from gear. gives the Warrior +100% to Parry chance until they Parry an attack after getting a critical strike with an Auto Attack.</div></div>
