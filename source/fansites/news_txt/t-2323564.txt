This Week in WoW History
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.

Tier 11 Models Released
The first raid in the Cataclysm brought us some great looking sets which were featured in 2010 prior to the release of Blackwing Descent. This was the first raid where loot was normalized in 10 and 25 man modes, allowing guilds to choose which raid size they wanted to go with.
