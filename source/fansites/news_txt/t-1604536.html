Warlords of Draenor Beta - Darker Nights<br>
It looks like the Darker Nights we looked at previously (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4154-Warlords-of-Draenor-Darker-Nights-Gaze-of-the-Black-Prince-Returns-Blue-Tweets) may not be coming to every zone, just some that were too bright at night.<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
Classes<br>
There will always be a &apos;best&apos;. it can be close though.<br>
This. If the difference between 2H and DW is a dozen stat points, that&apos;s fine. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/517736267136528385))<br>
<br>
what&apos;s the deal with glyphs? Mages have 24 while others have 30+ / 40+! That&apos;s sad to know. =/ #warcraft<br>
Mage: 21M/9m, Hunt: 25/11, Rog: 24/13, a lot of mage glyphs were baked into class recently though, suggests? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/517796654338945024))<br>

regarding Warlocks: Sims are showing Shadowburn as a DPS loss due to the removal of the mana return. Does this concern you?<br>
Of course, but that doesn&apos;t match what we&apos;re seeing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/517495593799655424))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Will Herald of the Titans be removed in 6.0?<br>
Nope, should still be available and in the same general tuning ballpark. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/517503331993137152))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
some confusion about if there can be multiple Ashran instances available to a single server <br>
Each realm only points to one Ashran but multiple realms may point to the same Ashran. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517475920194437120))<br>
will the 100 per faction cap potentially be raised if servers like Illidan/Sargeras end up with long Ashran queue times?<br>
We&apos;ll raise it as high as the game can handle (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517483187187236864))<br>
<br>
Will there be a base honor prize per win or just all strong box? currently on beta I&apos;ve won 20+ skirms and earned 349 honor <br>
There will be small honor prize per win. But you can expect skirmishes to be fairly inefficient at first. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517737616087605248))<br>
<br>
Is there an honor wipe at launch?<br>
Yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517781180696260608))<br>
<br>
Will the 2.2k enchants (Bloody Dancing Steel, Spirit of Conquest... etc.) still be available for purchase in WoD?<br>
The visual will be a part of the Enchanter&apos;s Study in the Garrisons. It will still have a rating requirement. I believe it&apos;s 2400 (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517796958694408192))<br>
<br>
Lore<br>
Horde do get off easy. Wage war and suffer no lasting damage. weird dichotomy compared how it played out Ally<br>
Disagree. Lots of Horde casualties; Darkspear rebels, Org civilians, vendors and trainers on spikes in SoO. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517500648707743744))<br>
<br>
But again, the Horde only started losing because Garrosh turned on itself, not because of Alliance action.<br>
How so? Alliance players raid Orgrimmar just the same. Fictionally, any raid who defeats SoO is responsible. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517501807841402881))<br>
<br>
I think it&apos;s more monotony: Horde acts, Alliance reacts, Horde implodes due to plot device, Alliance wins by passivity<br>
Operation Shieldwall not passive. Anduin chasing the Divine Bell not passive. SoO not passive. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517501006288941056))<br>
Wrathion himself concludes as much at the end.<br>
I don&apos;t think musing over Garrosh unraveling the Horde is meant to diminish the Alliance&apos;s impact on fighting him (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517501996769619968))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
I believe it is, just the Bunker will not increase the chance of upgraded follower chance from quests rewards.<br>
They still have the chance to be upgraded, it&apos;s just not increased by the building. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/517752515136221184))<br>
<br>
Kinda wish this wasn&apos;t the case so it didn&apos;t force those buildings on us. Choice with Garrisons seems nonexistent.<br>
At a point, you will have made all of the things you want, and you can&apos;t sell the soulbound reagents, so swap! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/517752800613134336))<br>
