Activision Blizzard Investor Call
The latest earnings call had a few interesting points! 


Blizzard had the biggest quarterly online player community in its history with a record 46 million MAUs, up 38% year-over-year. MAUs have doubled since early 2015. 
Blizzard had all-time record DAUs
The Overwatch community continued to grow more than a year after launch, setting another all-time MAUB record with the release of two seasonal events in the quarter
Hearthstone MAUs grew year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter to an all-time record, driven by its expansion, Journey to Un'Goro
World of Warcraft time spent grew year over year, and Legion continues to outperform the prior expansion.
Blizzard plans to release another large content drop this quarter, with more details at Gamescom.
There are multiple dedicated incubation teams working on new games, experiences, or IPs being lead by some of the most experienced game designers at Blizzard. The company is thinking about different platforms, especially mobile.

Blue Tweets
PvE
If the internal raid team has spent hours on testing KJ, why did take you so long to apply necessary adjustments to the boss? 
Seeing a top guild wipe repeatedly and get nowhere on an encounter for a day or two is not uncommon e.g. Dark Animus, Blackhand. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/893468425661464580
There's a narrow line between "this is VERY hard" and "this is TOO hard"; it took time because we weren't yet sure they were necessary. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/893468232505479169

Lore
Still not explained how Sargeras went about acquiring the titan souls. Retcon from Chronicles?
Eonar kind of explains this, in the time since the Chronicle he's managed to gather them all, except her, and has already turned Aggramar. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/892957199734939649
I know only so much can be expressed in game, I just wish it was explained better. Question is more how sargeras got souls from keepers.
I don't want to get too deep into it, but Sargeras has has quite a while to work on his plan. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/892959064795127808

Do the human turned worgen become immortal, or live at all longer than they wouldve normally?
I don't think anything in lore indicates that they live longer, but I might be wrong. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/894603828372185090


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
How friendly should developers get with community sites/leaders? I feel like if they are too friendly it gives a bad impression and feels cliqueish where their concerns are addressed more often than random players.
I would say very friendly. Those community sites are providing an enormous service for both you and players.

I agree there is a risk of you appearing to make game changes just because they request them. On the other hand, maybe they advocate those changes because they are representing the views of a lot of players who visit their site.

I’ve been in situations where we kept community creators and leaders at arm’s length, but I don’t think that stance makes sense. Consider this: gaming news sites want news because that drives visits to their site. They are going to provide news whether or not you as the developer are involved. But if you can give them something to talk about and it doesn’t just have to be a content exclusive, then they are getting what they need out of the relationship, but you’re getting something as well.

I feel quite indebted to all of the folks who ran Age of Empires, World of Warcraft, or League of Legends sites over the years. Source https://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/161004393623/how-friendly-should-developers-get-with-community
