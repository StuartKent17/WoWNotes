Blizzard may be getting ready to announce Blizzcon, with an update to the Blizzcon site that has since been reverted, including this information:
BlizzCon is an epic celebration of Blizzard Entertainment's game universes and the global player communities that bring them to life. 

This year marks the 10th BlizzCon and Blizzard's 25th anniversary—we’d love for you to join us in celebrating these milestones together at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California on Friday, November 4 and Saturday, November 5, 2016.
