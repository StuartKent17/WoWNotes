Boubouille2011-05-25, 11:20 PMUpdate 02:30AM CEST - Uploaded a very short video of the Celestial Dragon  on youtube - Celestial Dragon Video 

Update 02:00AM CEST - Added Patch 4.2 - PTR Build 14179 Items  to a dedicated thread. Among other things, the Flametalon of Alysrazor  is a likely candidate for the Raven Fire God Mount  datamined earlier. 


 

Update 01:30AM CEST - Assuming Blizzard didn't change the model, the Celestial Dragon  rewarded by Littlest Pet Shop  is most likely the one datamined in March 2010.
