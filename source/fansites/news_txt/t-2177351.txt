MMO-Champion's 10 Year Anniversary

For an entire decade, MMO-Champion has strived to provide its users with timely World of Warcraft news, including the latest patch notes and previews of upcoming game content. It’s been years of daily site updates, late nights collecting game information, and weekends filled with surprise patches - and it’s all been worth it. Many World of Warcraft players rely on MMO-Champion to stay informed, and we appreciate the dedication you’ve shown us over the years. Thanks for being here to celebrate our 10th anniversary with us today.

To recognize this fantastic achievement, we’re celebrating the most important part of MMO-Champion - our users. We have giveaways, trivia, a new site feature, and a collection of a few of the most interesting news posts from the last 10 years.
