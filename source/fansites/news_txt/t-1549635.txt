Warlords of Draenor - Tier 17 Hunter Armor Sets
Today we are taking a look at the Tier 17 Hunter armor sets.

Warlords of Draenor changes things up slightly by using one set of art for Raid Finder, one set of art for Normal and Heroic, and one set of art for Mythic difficulty. You can find the Raid Finder armor sets in our Raid Finder armor sets preview

Warlords of Draenor Theorycraft Discussion
Thanks for your answers. Sorry to lay the blood craze questions on thick, but...

Should an auto attack that causes two multistrikes result in a double application of blood craze and thus heal for twice as much? It seems to be doing that now. I'm not saying the behavior is wrong, just wondering if it's intended and thus probably won't change.

Also, I'm still seeing instances where a single multistrike event causes either 4 ticks or 5 ticks of healing. To clarify, this is without refreshes of the buff during its progress. The "lucky" 5-tick version heals for about 4.2% of max HP, the 4-tick version, about 3.3%. My main concern is with the variability in number of ticks. Perhaps some sort of timing/latency issue? Hard to model value of multistrike if the result can vary by 25%, with unclear rules governing the duration you actually get.
An auto attack that causes two multistrikes should indeed result in a double application of blood craze, and thus heal for twice as much. If you started with no Blood Craze, that'd result in a total of 6% pre-resolve, spread out over 4 ticks, aka 1.5% per tick.

I'm not sure how a single multistrike could result in 4, let alone 5 ticks. I'll investigate that tomorrow.

Will you be adding a multistrike bit to all of the _MISSED combat log events for the cases where multistrikes are fully absorbed/immuned/evaded?
Yes.

I do have one question in regard to Multistrike. I noticed this with Chi Explosion but I just now tested before the servers went down; but are any of the ticks from the DoT from Blackout Kick supposed to Multistrike? Currently the DoT will not Multistriking. The initial hit from Blackout Kick can Multistrike and the damage from the base hit plus the multistrike will go towards forming the DoT:

Base hits for 50k
Multistrike hits for 15k
Ticks from DoT hits for 3.9k = 50k + 15k * .3 / 5
That's working as intended. It doesn't double-dip.

Primal Tenacity and Resolve. You mentioned on Twitter that Resolve would affect PT, but it doesn't right now in Beta. Based on simming it definitely shouldn't, and PT might even need a nerf on top of that. I'm assuming that you changed your mind on Resolve affecting PT.
Correct on all counts.

Thrash impact crits are proccing Primal Fury i.e. generating 5 additional Rage per target hit. Intended? Note that this does not affect ticks.
We're going to change that. We had erred in the player's favor on that, but it's looking simply too strong to balance.
When you say change, I assume you mean make it so it can only proc off the primary target?
Yes.

So, I'm hoping to get a better understanding of how diseases Necrotic Plague especially and the new Pestilence will fit into all DPS DK rotations. It's fairly straightforward for Blood, but I'd greatly appreciate if you could comment on some of the following cases:

Frost AoE without Necrotic Plague: Howling Blast will continue to cause Frost Fever. Blood Plague will be worth utilising on Single-Target for both specs, but what about AoE?
On Live, it's currently not worth spreading BP with Pestilence unless 10+ targets will survive all 30s of the diseases- will WoD feel similar?

Frost AoE with Necrotic Plague: Howling Blast will stack Necrotic Plague very quickly for AoE purposes; Pestilence shouldn't see any use in most circumstances.

Unholy AoE without Necrotic Plague: Since Pestilence is a central part of the AoE rotation, we'll be cloning diseases constantly. This will mean that, assuming long term sustained AoE without Festering Strike use, we'll need to eventually reapply diseases with Outbreak/PS and then restart the cycle. Since DoT snapshotting is gone though, this won't be a problem.

Unholy AoE with Necrotic Plague: Since Pestilence clones Necrotic Plague stacks as well, this means that longer duration NPs are preferred- even if they're at lower stacks. This has the potential to be incredibly powerful when spreading 15-stack NPs to new adds. 
But what will this mean in cases where we lack an existing 15-stack of NP to spread i.e. no boss to spread or let it jump off? Will tick rates even out to the point where, even with its resetting mechanic, NP will still gain stacks fairly quickly? Or will it be optimal to wait till NP has "jumped" and stacked a little before Pestilencing? I know Mendenbarr's initial numbers suggested that waiting might be better in some cases, but just curious what the numbers look like on your end.

Also, completely separate question: Will Breath of Sindragosa interact with the Plaguebearer talent in any way? By this I mean will it add stacks of NP or extend disease duration?
I don't know the breakpoints that different rotations are worth using on, but in general terms...

Frost AoE without Necrotic Plague: Yes, you'll want to Pestilence once every ~30s to spread Blood Plague, but not spam Pestilence, since HB>Pest for AoE damage. Rest of your runes would goto HB, DnD, and PS.

Frost AoE with Necrotic Plague: Same, except without Pestilence.

Unholy AoE without Necrotic Plague: Correct.

Unholy AoE with Necrotic Plague: Finding the exactly optimal nuanced rotation for each specific starting case and target count is up to you, but generally... Your unholy runes going into PSs will help stack NP up faster, if you're spending BD/FD runes on Pestilence so NP is falling off. However, also worth considering is to mix FS and P at a rate such that NP never falls off. I suspect that that'll be optimal on some range of targets.

How is rune of cinderglacier intended to interact with diseases? Does it snapshot the benefit? Does it use charges to apply diseases?
Cinderglacier in general is still somewhat up in the air about how exactly it'll work. Ask again when you see changes to it.

Clarification: does this mean that Sacred Shield will eventually use the new HoT mechanics getting one partial tick at the end that varies in size based on haste? Because right now it's using the old ones, where it always grants an integer number of full ticks, and the tick time and overall duration change as you change haste.
Yes.

Unrelated: Uther's Insight the buff from Empowered Seals + Seal of Insight seems to be double-dipping on Versatility.
All HoTs are. Bug. We'll fix it.

Is the current Haste rating-->% conversion set to where you want it to be?
No, I believe the next build will raise it to 100rating/%.

Is it intended that both the Tiger Strikes mechanic and the ReM/RSK reset mechanics with Multistrike can proc from themselves?
We're changing it so that it can't trigger back to back.

Will fight specific or quest abilities be able to multistrike? IE Scorpion or AIM from Paragons and similar things that give extra action buttons. What about damage procs like trinkets or weapon enchants or on use trinkets like the Mini Iron Star?
Technically, it depends upon the effect, but a guideline that we usually expect to follow is "If it can crit, it can multistrike" for these cases.

Could you explain the mechanics of Necrotic Plague in regards to its stacks? I noticed once I get it to 15 stacks, nothing seems to be able to refresh it or add any more stacks. Is that the intended mechanic of the ability or some sort of bug?
Yes. It has a 15 stack cap, and nothing can refresh it. Reapplications add a stack but do not refresh it.

Festering Strike is special in that it can extend it.


Beta Realm Maintenance - July 8th and 9th
Unfortunately, it appears as though we'll have to extend this maintenance first thing overnight and into the morning, as we encountered some last minute issues preventing us from going live tonight.

Apologies for the extended downtime folks, I'll resume updating tomorrow morning once I know more.

Hey do you think you could look at Starfall and Rejuv? They could use a little graphical update.
They actually both have gotten tweaks since live. Don't intend to change them significantly. Celestalon 
yeah, was just running some CMs and noticed rejuv ends abruptly and starfall could use a little polish. Nothing big.
Yep, Rejuv's ending is fixed now, and Starfall got a bit of polish. Celestalon 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Thank you Jon! I know it seems like a silly ability. But I think its a true staple of being a hunter. Exploring.
I looked into this recently. The tech involved in bringing Eyes of the Beast back would require extensive work. Celestalon 

How exactly does LnL interact with BA Multistrikes again? I'm getting conflicting information from everywhere.
Each Multistrike grants 1 stack of LnL, which can stack up to 5. Celestalon 
Okay, so it will *only* proc off multistrike then?
Yes. Celestalon 
How long will charges last if not used right away?
15sec, currently. Celestalon 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Is the mirror image talent a placeholder? Are the rest too? Does anyone expect a mage not to take rune of power?
Are you saying they're imbalanced vs. rune currently, numbers-wise? Or there's something inherently wrong? Muffinus 
rune > mirror image currently. Unless you're making every raid boss "everyone is moving and walking all the time 420 garalon"
Like > or like >> or >>> I need quantification here man. Science. Graduated cylinder. Muffinus 
They scale with your Haste, Crit, Multistrike, Versatility, Spellpower. We haven't done tuning yet, to balance the row. Celestalon 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Any ETA on the Serpent Stance scaling issues? BotS ticks for 1k in serpent and 10k in crane.
Breath of the Serpent was accidentally set to scale with AP, not SP. Fixed that for the next next build. Celestalon 

Is Chi Explosion replacing BoK intentional, in that case, is not having the BoK crit buff intentional w/ Chi Explosion?
Yes, no. And if you were hitting for 500k, it was probably against a low level target, where you get a damage multiplier. Celestalon 
Is this the buff to help us solo old raid content?
Yes. Celestalon 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
I recently noticed Holy Avenger no longer uses the Ashbringer model for your weapon. Bug or intended? I always loved the model.
Intended, for lore reasons. Celestalon 
However, Seraphim does give you a really sweet-looking custom 2H hammer, or 1H hammer and shield. Celestalon 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Would it be possible for the shaman to talent into a permanent pet EarthTank / FireDps ?
No, Shamans are not a pet class. Doesn't fit. Celestalon 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Yup, that is also gone strangely. I might be able to understand Twilight Ward, but CoE and Command Demon are important
Command Demon is coming back. CoE is gone because that whole raid debuff is gone replaced with a Multistrike buff. Celestalon 

PvP
Is it possible to make offensive heal play viable again? Like when priests used to deal dmg from time to time to score a kill
In general I think healer damage is going to be higher relative to MoP. PvP Power reigned it in a bit. holinka 

thoughts on changing gladiator gear to warlord gear? And start over with the names. Warlords Mutilator etc then Deadly and so on..
We have some plans in this regard holinka 

Reputation / Questing
Sorry not a pvp Question, but does not answer me. Is WoD mob dmg tuned? Seems very low, no challenge at all atm. Thanks
Early quest content is tuned to be easy. Additionally, if you copied your character over, you'll be very overgeared. Celestalon 

World
After playing The beta. Any chance could see some more npcs? It's feeling a bit underpopulated. Like guards and labourers
Lots of work being done on this now. Muffinus 

Garrisons
Hey, I love how many followers I could get from exploring the world. Quite fun. I loved the choice of 1 out of 3 followers one too
Cool! Glad you had fun Muffinus 
Would of loved to know their abilities before I made my choice.
Considering options, e.g. collect them all at max level. Regardless, you'll have a solid slew of abils/traits no matter what. Muffinus
