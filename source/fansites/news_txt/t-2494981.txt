chaud2019-07-02, 03:50 AM"Battle for Nazjatar" Changes Made
We’ve heard your feedback and experienced it ourselves – there can be lopsided faction representation during the “Battle for Nazjatar” event. We’ve seen cases where only one faction is represented.

To address this, we’ve now changed it via hotfix so the “Battle for Nazjatar” will only become active when Nazjatar has a good mix of both Horde and Alliance players in War Mode. When that is not the case, an alternative event will become active called “Azshara’s Elite Commanders.” This is also available to players who are not in War Mode, and it also awards Nazjatar Battle Commendations for slaying Elite commanders during the event.

We’re continuing to monitor and investigate reports of server lag during the event, and we’re acting on feedback about significantly imbalanced areas. We’ll let you know as we make further changes.

Thank you for your patience and continued feedback!
