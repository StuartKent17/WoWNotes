Zek'voz, Herald of N'zoth - Battle for Azeroth
Our friends at Fatboss are back with a preview of Zek'voz from the Technical Raid Test during the Battle for Azeroth alpha.


<iframe width="900" height="506" src="" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>


Overview - Zek'voz attacks players while the compromised Titan Discs come online, calling forth powerful Old God magics and summoning their lesser servants. As new Titan Discs come online, previously activated Discs will power down.

[Arcane] Mana Adept Discussion
A version of Mana Adept that read "Clearcasting causes Arcane Missiles fires 2 additional missiles." would solve a lot of problems
This is an option we've been considering though nothing specific for next build. It would be a simple and effective talent in its own right. We do like having a talent that preserves the Mana Adept mana gameplay, but whether that belongs on an Arcane Missiles talent does depend, as people are saying, on whether it can be done without causing rotational problems. Arcane is a rotation that is unusually--for lack of a better word--fragile, so it's always helpful to keep an eye out for issues like this. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Aura of Sacrifice should not be damaging the user below 75%HP in any case same as on live. It's not clear from this discussion whether people are actually seeing that happen on beta. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

BfA Discipline Priest Feedback
The talent row balancing comments are something we'll probably look at in a little more detail slightly later, though there is a simple buff in the pipeline for Luminous Barrier.

On the base rotation: while we don't want it to be as burst-oriented as it was in Legion due to Light's Wrath, we are looking to add a little more texture back as far as moments of higher damage/healing. In the next build, we're trying out Power of the Dark Side as a baseline part of the spec.

On Power Word: Shield based on various comments in a lot of different places: Power Word: Shield will definitely be used a lot more than it was in Legion obviously, due to not having a cooldown. But, we neither expect nor want it to be like the PW:S spam of Mists or Warlords. In those days, a rotation based almost entirely on PW:S did sufficient healing to make a Disc using that rotation into a top healer. Therefore it was doing roughly an entire healer's worth of healing in the form of absorbs.

Disc in BFA should not be able to put out that level of absorption, even if it uses a higher portion of casts on PW:S. Using PW:S, and absorbs generally, is still a core part of Disc's identity, but reaching full healing potential still requires a significant contribution of other mechanics like Atonement. We don't see it as a problem if PW:S is a major workhorse spell of the rotation in all contexts, but the opportunities to apply very high amounts of shielding are cooldown-limited Rapture and Luminous Barrier, and current talents that buff PW:S generally do so without adding absorption Lenience and Orison.

Mythic Dungeon Invitational APAC Rescheduling
During last week’s broadcast of the Mythic Dungeon Invitational Asia Pacific Region, numerous recurring issues with an Australian internet service provider caused significant internet outages for a large number of our competitors. Due to these extreme circumstances, we had to postpone several of the remaining matches in order to preserve tournament integrity.

In order to fit the remaining matches into the current MDI schedule, 4 of the remaining 7 matches will be played off-broadcast over the next week, and we will share the outcome of those matches with you!

However, we will be broadcasting the APAC Upper, Lower, and Grand Finals on Saturday, May 5th, after the Day 1 Broadcast of the MDI Americas Group Stage. Broadcasts for the APAC Upper, Lower, and Grand finals will begin approximately:

PDT: 18:00, Saturday, May 5 EDT: 21:00, Saturday, May 5 AEST: 11:00, Sunday, May 6These matches will determine which teams get to advance to the MDI Global Finals on June 22nd, so don’t miss them!

Both Days of the Americas Group Stage broadcast will begin at their originally scheduled time of 1pm Eastern/10am Pacific. Day 1 will have 6 matches, and then the 3 APAC final matches. Day 2 will have the remaining 8 matches of the Americas Group Stage.


Build of the Month - April 2018
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

All of the parts on this page are Amazon affiliate links. When you purchase your parts through them it helps support the site!

This month
The current SSD prices  are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale.

Graphics card prices are still somewhat inflated due to cryptocurrency mining right now. There isn't much you can do beyond waiting for prices to come down or purchasing from somewhere that offers a bundled card with other hardware. 

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 8700K and would get more performance from spending that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions!

This Week in WoW History
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.

Patch 4.1: Rise of the Zandalari
The first content patch of the Cataclysm, Rise of the Zandalari, brought quite a few changes to the game. The Call to Arms system, which we are already used to by now, saw its introduction in this patch, rewarding players who queue up as roles that there are few of in the dungeon finder. The rework of Zul’aman and Zul’gurub were fully revamped and introduced as 5-man dungeons. Features such as Guild Challenges, and the Guild Finder also saw addition to the game.


  

Patch 4.2 Preview
A blue post, and developer interview gave us a glimpse into what to expect from the second major patch of the Cataclysm. Firelands was announced as the new raid, with Ragnaros being the last boss. In this raid, caster DPS also got access to a Legendary questline which would take several weeks to complete, and reward players with a weapon they would use for the rest of the expansion. The Molten Front daily quest hub was also previewed, where players got access to a new faction, and plenty of rewards.


  

Item Restoration
Have you ever destroyed, vendored, or disenchanted an item by mistake? In 2012, the Battle.net Item Restoration was announced. This feature allows players to restore items every 30 days, with some limitations. This system is still in the game today, and can be easily accessed through the Battle.net website. 


  

Deepwind Gorge
The last battleground of Mists of Pandaria was added in Patch 5.3. Deepwind Gorge is a 15 player battleground for players above level 90. This is a hybrid map, the objective of which is to control the three flag points, and capture the enemy cart. Both of these objectives give resources, and the team which reaches 1600 first wins. 


  

Legion Pre-Expansion Event
The Legion Pre-Expansion Event brought some interesting changes to the capital cities. Players will get whispers, corrupting their minds, turning them into a tool for the Legion. After 9 stacks of Frail Mind, players gained 5 abilities which allowed them to turn allies into Legion sympathizers, take on the appearance of targets, vanish, or corrupt the minds of targets causing mass Hysteria.


  

World of Warcraft on NES
Rkade Soup on Youtube made a short video of what World of Warcraft would look like on the NES. This video walks us through the story of a new Orc, and his journey through his first dungeon run.


  

Hayven Games
Last year, on the 18th of March we lost one of our beloved World of Warcraft content creators, Hayven Games. He passes away from epithelioid sarcoma at the age of 26 years old. A short tribute video titled “Last Video - Rest in peace, Hayven” was posted on his channel. All funds that go through his Patreon after his passing get directly donated to Cancer Research.
