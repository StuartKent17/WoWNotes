The 2.3.2 patch is now online on PTR ! No premade, and for the moment it seems that all the undocumented classes changes I posted 2 days ago were correct.

Blizzard / Dell partnership : New wallpapers
Dell launched a new Dell XPS Gaming line with the support of Blizzard and created a WoW themed website  for the occasion. After giving away your name and email you will eventually end up here  with 6 wallpapers available at the bottom of the page. 

The 2nd wallpaper  looks a lot like Kael'thas happily reviving things near the Sunwell, but I could be wrong. Nice spaulders by the way

Update : It seems that it's an artwork used for an old TCG Card : Varanis Bitterstar  No uber sunwell for you today people !
