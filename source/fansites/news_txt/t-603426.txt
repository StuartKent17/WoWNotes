Blizzard / Dell partnership : New wallpapers
Dell launched a new Dell XPS Gaming line with the support of Blizzard and created a WoW themed website http://www.dell.com/html/global/topics/gaming/en/us/us/dhs/wow-signup.html for the occasion. After giving away your name and email you will eventually end up here http://dellgamingus.p.delivery.net/m/p/del/wow/Thankyou.html with 6 wallpapers available at the bottom of the page. 

The 2nd wallpaper http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/november/dell/w2_1920x1200.jpg looks a lot like Kael'thas happily reviving things near the Sunwell, but I could be wrong. Nice spaulders by the way

Update : It seems that it's an artwork used for an old TCG Card : Varanis Bitterstar http://wow.tcgplayer.com/db/card.asp?id=469. No uber sunwell for you today people !
