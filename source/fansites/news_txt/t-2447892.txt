chaud2018-11-08, 06:47 PMWoW Classic Demo Extended to Monday
It’s been awesome seeing all the excitement building around WoW Classic and the play-at-home demo we released as part of the BlizzCon Virtual Ticket. So awesome, in fact, that we’d like to keep the party going for a few more days!

We’ve extended the duration of the WoW Classic Demo to last through the weekend, ending at 10 AM Pacific time on Monday, November 12. That should give you plenty of time to track down those remaining Zhevra Hooves, or finish cooking up some Westfall Stew.

We hope you’re enjoying the WoW Classic Demo and can’t wait to share the full game with you next summer!
