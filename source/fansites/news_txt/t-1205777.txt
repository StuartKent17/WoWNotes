Tanking Damage Adjustment Hot Fixes
We’ve recently implemented several hot fixes to adjust tank damage output, particularly area of effect AoE damage. Now that Mogu’Shan Vaults is available, and the first week of Mists of Pandaria raiding is about to begin, we wanted to call out what’s changing.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior / Skills http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warrior / Talent Calculator http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#E
Warriors have several mechanics that improve their tanking performance when dealing with multiple foes, as well as their damage output against them. Their damage against packs of creatures, especially when three targets were present, was much higher than other tanking classes. While some variance is expected, it was clear that an adjustment was necessary. 
The primary culprits here were Revenge and Deep Wounds:

Revenge http://www.wowdb.com/spells/6572 now deals 50% damage to a secondary target, and 25% damage to a third target. Deep Wounds http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115768 now does 50% less damage for Protection Warriors only.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin / Skills http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin / Talent Calculator http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I
One of our goals with our active mitigation tanking model is that you have opportunities to trade significant survivability for more damage when maximum survivability isn’t required. For example, a Warrior could opt to use their rage for Heroic Strike instead of Shield Block or Shield Barrier. This damage gain is intended to be relatively small, and not worth the loss in survivability when actively tanking. 

However, for Protection Paladins, this trade-off was much too lucrative. For maximum survivability, Protection Paladins are intended to use Seal of Insight, since it provides a buff to their self-healing, and also provides a significant self-heal on their melee in combination with Vengeance. Unfortunately, when using Seal of Insight, their damage was too low compared to the other tanks. When using Seal of Truth, their damage was too high. So, we’ve increased Protection Paladin damage in general to compensate for Seal of Insight’s relatively low output, while simultaneously reducing the damage of Seal of Truth to bring it into line. 

Holy Wrath http://www.wowdb.com/spells/119072 now deals 100% more damage. Avenger's Shield http://www.wowdb.com/spells/31935 now deals 50% more damage. Seal of Truth http://www.wowdb.com/spells/31801 and Censure http://www.wowdb.com/spells/31803 now deal 80% less damage for Protection Paladins only.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid / Skills http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/druid / Talent Calculator http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#s
Bear tanks have been in a decent place, but we were a little concerned about their sustained area of effect damage. This update to Thrash should address that.

The periodic damage of Thrash http://www.wowdb.com/spells/106832 Bear now deals 60% more damage. Initial direct damage remains un-changed.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk / Skills http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk / Talent Calculator http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o
We’re really excited about how Brewmaster Monks are turning out. They can still stand a few tweaks though. Their damage, especially AoE damage, was relatively low, and they lacked a way to apply Weakened Blows to a large pack of creatures which all of the other tanks have.

Keg Smash http://www.wowdb.com/spells/121253 now deals 50% more damage and strikes all nearby targets, rather than three. Swift Reflexes http://www.wowdb.com/spells/124334 now deals 100% more damage.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight / Skills http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight / Talent Calculator http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Y
While Blood Death Knights have been higher on damage than most other tanks, we’re expecting that the adjustments we’re making to the other tanking classes will close the gap. While we haven’t made any changes to Blood lately, we will be keeping a close eye on it.


Patch 5.0.5 Hotfixes - October 2
General

Players no longer require Honored reputation with Mists of Pandaria factions to purchase gear with Justice Points.
The reputation requirement to purchase certain pieces of Mists of Pandaria Valor Point gear have been reduced from Revered to Honored. These include:

Klaxxi - neck items http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-sold-currency=396&filter-expansion=5&filter-quality=16&filter-slot=4

Shado-Pan - cloaks http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-sold-currency=396&filter-expansion=5&filter-quality=16&filter-slot=65536
August Celestials - bracers http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-sold-currency=396&filter-expansion=5&filter-quality=16&filter-slot=512


The item level of Mists of Pandaria gear that is purchased with Justice Points has been raised from 450 to 458.
The item level of Mists of Pandaria gear that is purchased with Honor Points has been lowered from 464 to 458. As a result, the quality color of these items has been changed from Epic to Rare. However, the PvP Power and PvP resilience of these items has been increased significantly so these items retain their previous degree of effectiveness in PvP.
Mists of Pandaria PvP item vendors were tired of getting the dook kicked out of them. Their health has been increased significantly.
The item level requirement to queue for Mists of Pandaria Heroic dungeons has been reduced from 440 to 435.
