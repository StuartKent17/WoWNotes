Patch 5.2 Dev Interviews
Let's take a look at another of the dev interviews today, the NowGamer interview with Ghostcrawler 


In Cataclysm, players who hit 85 and were not in a raiding guild or a serious PvPer didn't really have much to do, so Mists of Pandaria aimed to solve that problem. 
Thunderforged Weapons were supposed to be a way to keep loot somewhat interesting, even after farming the same bosses for months. The increased drop rate in 25 player difficulty was just a way to give players a reward for the increased logistical challenges. 
It is much easier for a 25 player raiding guild to drop to 10 players than it is for a 10 player raiding guild to grow to 25 players. Blizzard still likes 25 player raiding though, as it offers a more epic experience, more opportunities for players, and a more resilient raiding group. 
There is a good chance that item upgrades will come back in odd numbered patches, as players have run out of new gear to buy with Valor. This also increases player power to help them through progression if they are stuck. 
If item upgrades come back, it is likely that they will be much cheaper, making it practical to upgrade everything. 
The Patch 5.1 legendary quest that required 6,000 Valor was likely too high, with a number closer to 2,000 or 3,000 being more appropriate. 
There is a lot of interest on the dev team in turning old player favorites into challenge modes. 
Challenge mode participation rates are higher than Blizzard had predicted. 
Adding new class abilities is exciting for current players, but adds something new to learn for returning players. Striking a balance between keeping things fresh for existing players and not making a larger barrier to returning players is challenging. 
Blizzard has talked about getting content out faster for a long time, but is really starting to deliver on it now. 
Adding new things that last one expansion, but not forever is part of the plan, with the farm in Mists of Pandaria as an example. Otherwise you end up with a system like guild leveling that must be supported forever. 
WoW on a console would be very challenging, but possible. There would be a lot of design issues to solve. 
Patch 5.2 is an example of the the type of content players can expect year after year, for as long as players keep playing. World Of Warcraft is alive and well!



Solution for Unlucky Bonus Roll Streaks
One of the ideas mentioned in the interviews was a increasing chance to win something to offset unlucky streaks, and Cory Stockton shared  a little more about it today!


  


Throne of Thunder Heroic Progression
Not much progression today! Exodus , Экзорсус , and Apex  joined the 8/8 club, but no one has been able to down Dark Animus yet. You can keep up with the kills on Manaflask , our forum thread !, and WowProgress

Treasure Room is Far Too Confusing
Hey now, my first time I killed the boss and got out with Tenwu. But of course, I went to youtube to look this stuff up before my first time. I'm not sure that's a good thing for players to feel like is the *right* approach. And right now, that is very much the right approach. You are simply cheating yourself if you don't make use of third party resources on this. 

I'm also not a fan of the term "tutorial." People hear "tutorial" and they think of pop ups, NPC's offering tips, and the like. It can be fun to explore yourself. It's not fun when exploration feels punishing to your weekly five-minute long opportunity.

I admit, if this were just a series of rooms linked together with no major goal other than hopefully opening chests, I'd feel different. In large part, my feelings about this are influenced by the fact that they also decided to attach achievement parts to it. Five minutes a week to try to learn the place for these achievements just feels obnoxious. 
But that's true of anything. You're at a disadvantage for anything if you don't look at a guide first. And certainly if you're an achievement hunter you would. If you're just a casual player you might jump in, go WHAT IS HAPPENING and run around furiously trying to open chests ... and that's kind of what it should be like. It should be high stress. There are supposed to be traps and events to slow you down that you aren't aware of. If you didn't open a ton of chests that's ok, it's free stuff even if you only open 1.

Yes you're at a disadvantage if you don't buy the strategy guide for every new game that comes out, but discovery of the game, its mechanics, trying to interpret the design intent, and overcoming those challenges is part of what makes games fun. At least for me. If you want to look up videos for everything before trying them though you can.

I think the disconnect here is if you feel like this is a piece of content that owes you something; a minimum reward level and you feel cheated if you're not allowed to achieve that. It's not. It's free stuff that isn't directly related to character growth or improvement. You can run it every week or never run it and probably not be any better or worse off in the long run. It's just fun. If fun is looking up the strategies beforehand, cool, and if not, good luck! Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Throne of Thunder LFR Drop Rates
i have done ToT lfr, first normal run so i got the bag from every boss + i used 3 coins, and once with only coins, totally i spent 6 coins and no loot at all. srsly is the droprate on 5% on every boss or what!? it's freakin lfr! 
The coins have a low chance of awarding you items, just as it was in the 5.0 raids. On the other hand, a handful of 6 examples is a rather limited sample to draw conclusions on what the droprate is, or how useful the Raid Finder of Throne of Thunder is, particularly for those folks that have been running mostly the 5.0 Raid Finders but nothing else beyond that difficulty.

However, if you're a normal raider, it's likely that, in the long run, Raid Finder won't hold many interesting items for you, since Normal gear has a higher item level 522 as opposed to LFR's 502. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

PvE
Will there ever be an option for LFR where we can chose Off Spec for the loot rolls since its personal loot?
Likely, yes. Source 

So did the failbag changes not make patch 5.2 release ?
Yeah, they should be in. Remember: just for Raid Finder's personal loot bag. Bonus roll doesn't give a bag. Source 

why can we queue reg randoms for JP with guildies like we could in Cata? Hate being FORCED into heroics when I feel not ready
So many people wanted to jump right to heroics that we weren't sure there was an audience. In retrospect there seems to be. Source 

God forbid you increase the spawn rate. Or allow players to tap a mob without allowing people to grief others.
Increasing the spawn rate of quest boss mobs is weird. They already respawn almost instantly when someone kills them. Source 

Not that I'm opposed: why are you now going back to the TBC model where a boss is not intended for most players?
It's 1 boss in the 30+ we've made for MoP. I think most players can live with that ratio. Source 

PvP
Any plans to use lfr engine to match random battlegrounds especially to balance healers numbers?
Yes. Source 

Why its still possible in 2013 to get 4 healers team against non healers team in random battleground?
It's possible because the BG queue system is like 5 years older than the LFR one. We want to redo it though. Source 

Do we have a new resilience formula with 5.2? Same values show different tooltips for 5.2 and 5.1.
Yes. It's a linear curve instead of an exponential one. Lower ilevels might get a buff. Higher ilevels should stay the same. Source 

So you don't like uncounterable things. But for some reason that doesn't include ... blanket silences?
We don't like blanket silences, but without them, instant heals couldn't be countered. Source 
Change blanket silences to only affect instant casts?
That's interesting. Would have to think about it more. Source 

gorefeinds into a vortex into a solar beam surrounded by a rof is a huge part of high Rbgs play, seems too strong, thoughts?
It's definitely potent. I hate to just nerf everything that's an effective strategy though. Source 

Altho, you cant really compare rets to holy, they need to be viable in comparison to other melee classes.
Now that sentiment I agree with. I was just pointing out how much the healer respec issue complicates interpreting representation Source 
I pay to play ret. Zero interest in playing holy thanks. I expect to be on a par with other melee. Not unreasonable.
No, that's totally reasonable. I was just explaining why looking at representation can give a skewed perspective. Source 

Are you happy with the FACT that high end raiders are useless in PvP with their heroic gear
They definitely aren't as powerful as folks who earned actual PvP gear, which seems like the superior design, no? Source
