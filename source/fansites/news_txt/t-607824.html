With M&apos;uru out of the picture, we&apos;re left with 5 weapons from the old and always-reliable sunwell loot leak (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/sunwell_loots.jpg). We can assume that all these weapons drop from Kil&apos;jaeden and it&apos;s probably a good time to make full size screenshots of them. Even if the stats on the original screenshot was accurate, they could have been changed in the last weeks and it might be slightly different in 2.4.2. However it didn&apos;t happen yet for any of the item from this screenshot.<br>

Official Forum Reorganization<br>
On Wednesday, May 21, we&#x2019;ll be making some changes to the way the forums are organized. While the majority of these changes only alter how the current forums are grouped together, we will be removing the Guild Recruitment forum entirely, and replacing it with new Guild Recruitment &#x2013; Alliance, and Guild Recruitment &#x2013; Horde forums. By splitting the forum we&#x2019;re effectively cutting the posting traffic of the forum in half which will help keep the recruitment posts there visible for a longer amount of time before falling off the first page. When this change happens all posts currently in the Guild Recruitment forum will be removed, so if you or your guild currently have a recruitment post there please keep a copy to repost after the split.<br>
<br>
We don&#x2019;t anticipate these changes to cause any issues for posters while we make them, but some forum navigation options may only be partially functional until we&#x2019;ve completed the work.<br>
