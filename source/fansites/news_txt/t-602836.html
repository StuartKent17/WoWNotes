For the time being, we&apos;ll have to live with this theory. ^^<br>
<br>
Update : Screenshots of the Zul&apos;aman sets (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php#zasets) have been updated. <br>
Update : Screenshot of the Sporeggar Exalted pet (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/sporebatdr8.jpg) added.<br>
Also it seems that one of the paladin change already listed in the updated patch notes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php#23changes) has been modified slightly, the threat reduction on Fanaticism no longer works when Righteous Fury is active.<br>
<br>
Update : Ritual of Refreshment now requires 2 [item=17020]<br>

Update : Added a Season 1 Honor Price (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/s3/s1honor.jpg) screenshot for weapons, might be easier to read than the chart on the 2.3 compilation post.<br>
