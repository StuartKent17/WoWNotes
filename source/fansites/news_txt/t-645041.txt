The Molten damage from when Iron Constructs turn molten has been reduced, the ground damage from Scorch has been reduced, and the total health of Ignis himself has been reduced.

For the Thorim encounter, the Runic Colossus should stop channeling Runic Smash once engaged in combat, the Dark Rune Champion should no longer whirlwind after being disarmed, and the Runic Colossus should no longer melee when it charges.

The Kologarn encounter has received the following changes: the speed of the Eyebeam has been decreased, the amount of damaged required to break a player from Stone Grip has been decreased, and slightly decreased the amount of damage done by Stone Grip.
Some changes we have made to the trash mobs in the Antechamber the area near Iron Council are: the Devastating Leap from the Chamber Overseer is now a Stun Mechanic, Champer Overseers should no longer be immune to disarm, standing on the Flaming Rune should no longer proc Runic Explosion, Iron Menders should be immune to charm, Charged Dwarves should be immune to charm, the damage from Ball Lightning cast by Lightning Charged Iron Dwarves has been decreased in heroic difficulty, and the damage of Runed Flame Jets have been decreased.

The time between Mole Machines spawning in the Razorscale encounter has been slightly increased.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/deathknight.jpg Death Strike Healing Nerf
We have since made another hotfix to just change the way the healing works completely. It now heals 5% of the death knight's health per disease on the target, up to a max of 15%. This should allow Frost and Unholy to benefit from Death Strike healing while letting Blood benefit from extra Death Strike damage. The tooltip will not reflect this change until we can patch the client.

Arena Season 6 - Starting Tomorrow
According to today's blue post, the Season 6 of the Arena is still scheduled to start tomorrow on live servers!
We have stated that players should expect season 6 to start as early as tomorrow. This is still the plan. 

Arena Season 6 – Upcoming Changes
Now that Arena Season 6 is on the horizon, we wanted to share some details regarding upcoming changes to the arena rating system in Arena Season 6. With Arena Season 6, arena teams will start at 0 rating instead of 1500, which will allow teams to have more continuous progression throughout the arena season. In addition, we reevaluated item purchases and felt many of them were too difficult to obtain so we will be altering the rating requirements needed to purchase the latest arena items. For example, items with a rating requirement will now be obtainable starting at 1250 rating.

As with the current system, the matchmaking system will attempt to match teams against opponents who are closest to their average matchmaking rating. Starting with Arena Season 6, a team’s average matchmaking rating will be shown in the scoreboard at the end of each match so that you can see where your team stands compared to the opposing team you just faced. All arena teams that are below a 1500 arena rating will always earn arena points as a 1500 rated team. This will allow teams to continue to build up arena points while working on gaining the ratings needed to purchase items.

Please note that a more specific start date for Arena Season 6 will be provided as soon as it is determined.

Here is a list of some PvP items that will be available in Arena Season 6 and their expected rating requirements:

Rating Required:
1250+: Deadly Relics/Idols/Librams/Totems 
1300+: Deadly Gloves
1350+: Deadly Legs
1400+: Deadly Chest
1450+: Deadly Helm
1500+: Deadly Shoulders

1400+: Furious Bracer honor
1450+: Furious Belt honor
1500+: Furious Boots honor
1550+: Furious Neck honor
1600+: Furious Gloves
1650+: Furious Ring honor
1700+: Furious Legs
1750+: Furious Chest
1800+: Furious Trinket honor
1850+: Furious Weapon
1900+: Furious Helm
1950+: Furious Wands/Relics/etc 
2000+: Furious Cloak honor
2050+: Furious Shoulders
2200+: 2nd Tier Furious Weapon
2300+: Furious Tabard No Rating Required:
Hateful Gloves
Hateful Legs
Hateful Chest
Hateful Helm
Hateful Shoulders
Hateful Ring
Hateful Trinket
Deadly Bracer
Deadly Belt
Deadly Boots
Deadly Neck
Deadly Ring
Deadly Cape
Deadly Trinket

To answer some players’ questions:
Only the current arena season’s weapons furious will be available. Deadly weapons will be removed when Arena Season 6 starts.
The first tier furious weapons will be equivalent to heroic Ulduar weapons and the second tier furious weapons will match heroic hard mode Ulduar weapons. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that until you start to get close to your team's matchmaking rating, you will be gaining around 20 or more points in a win and zero or nearly zero in a loss. So players will make steady progress through games played until they near their team's matchmaking rating. 

Season 6 - Weapons
We do not have the stats of the weapons yet but we already know that the color of this new season is blue! 

The stats of the weapons will be available as soon as the servers go live
