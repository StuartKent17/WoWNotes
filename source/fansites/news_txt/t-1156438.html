<br>
Heart of Fear<br>
The Sha of Fear has corrupted the grand empress of the mantid. Her increasingly erratic and paranoid commands have driven the Klaxxi--the keepers of mantid culture--to take aggressive action. Because they are few in number, the Klaxxi are reluctantly willing to accept outside help in destroying the empress and purging their race of the sha&apos;s negative influence.<br>

Exhale (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122761) - Imperial Vizier Zor&apos;lok selects a random player and screams at them, inflicting Physical damage and stunning them for 6 sec.

Stage One: Her Gifts are Many - Imperial Vizier Zor&apos;lok flies to a random platform in the room, then attacks the players from there. When Zor&apos;lok loses 20% of his total health, he changes positions to a different platform. Imperial Vizier Zor&apos;lok gains one ability while at each platform, but loses that ability when he moves to a different platform.<br>
<br>

Please Bring Back Attunements<br>
Not just TBC attunements, but also the ones you needed for onyxia, molten core and blackwing lair. Especially onyxia one was really fun to do.<br>
Although we might look at them with rose-tinted glasses these days, some players back in the days complained that these attunements were too long. Guilds would also complain, eventually, as they had to pick up new recruits and basically run them through &quot;old content&quot; in order to get them up to speed (memory might be playing tricks on me, but I remember this happening when Tier 6 was live). <br>
<br>
For those that miss them for the lore they brought, be sure to check the Lorewalker faction in Mists of Pandaria!<br>
<br>
When you actually see people even more casuals (and by all mean I am a 3 hours/day kind of player, not even close to hardcore) complain about how the game has nothing in it anymore to do, which -before you counter with &quot;end expansion time&quot; arguement- happens EVERY tier now, then there is something seriously going wrong.<br>
The end expansion time argument, like it or not, it&apos;s one that can&apos;t be just put aside. It happened with Wrath of the Lich King, TBC and Vanilla. We&apos;ve seen this in the past, in the exact same shape as now.<br>
<br>
Attunements, while might not be the only answer to this, WILL give the whiners something to do.<br>
The devs would rather give something fun to do to the players than something that might be repetitive, not as attractive, or even problematic in the long run (as it happened with attunements in the old days). <br>
<br>
That&apos;s something that Mists of Pandaria will try to improve through various means both when players get to the cap level and on their way there:<br>
<br>
<br>
Pet battles<br>
Daily quests (there&apos;s roughly, around 300 daily quests in Mists of Pandaria. Although these are randomized, you&apos;d have around 48 quests available on any given day, and you can do as many of them as you wish).<br>
Scenarios<br>
Normal/Heroic dungeons<br>
Challenge modes (which might be especially appealing to the more hardcore crowd)<br>
LFR &amp; 10/25 man normal/Heroic raids.<br>
<br>
<br>
They just don&apos;t want to put the slightest effort to learn, so asking them for the slightest effort in doing few quests or group quests or dungeon quests or raid quests which was actually amazing way to tell the lore of the game also feels like a great effort for said people, which isn&apos;t.<br>
For some players it might&apos;ve been an amazing way to tell the lore (for me it certainly was); but for some others it was just getting in their way, preventing them from entering into raids. It&apos;s not as simple as arguing that those players didn&apos;t want to put the effort. In some cases, that content was just not attractive to them, in the same way than for a more PVP-minded player, PVE content is not as appealing as playing, for instante, a Ratted Battleground if given the choice. <br>
<br>
Sure, the old attunements were bad, are you claiming it is only possible to do long boring ones? They can be updated for 2012 without being the same as vanilla TBC, attunements should introduce players to playing their class well to progress this journey of character progression is much more engaging and enjoyable than the current &apos;see the content&apos; journey.<br>
There&apos;re almost infinite perceptions of what&apos;s considered &quot;playing a class well&quot;. What might be acceptable for you as an individual, might not be even close to what should be acceptable for another player, or might be even way too much for a completely different player. <br>
<br>
If you ask what&apos;s playing a class well to a hardcore PVP player, a Hardcore raider, a casual PVP player, a casual raider... you&apos;ll get different answers from all of them. (Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4849015040?page=15#297))<br>

WoW Summer Challenge: Ulduar<br>
Every week this summer, we&#x2019;re challenging you to get together with a few friends to explore a part of Azeroth that you may not have seen in a while, or perform a feat that you may have never done. They&apos;re World of Warcraft Summer Challenges, and we&#x2019;re going to be playing along with you as we hunt down rare achievements, get screenshots of amazing bosses, and try to find some awesome gear for our transmogrification sets.<br>
<br>
This week&#x2019;s challenge is: Ulduar (http://www.wowpedia.org/Ulduar).<br>
<br>
Since discovering Ulduar in the Storm Peaks, adventurers have journeyed to the titan city to learn more about its mysterious past. Further exploration has revealed that the magnificent complex is above all a prison, intended to permanently confine the Old God of death, Yogg-Saron. This ancient horror has corrupted its guards, and now it is breaking through the last of its restraints.<br>
<br>
Near the top of the continent Northrend, Ulduar is home to a whopping 14 raid bosses. This week, we&apos;re getting together with friends who haven&apos;t gone toe-to-to with Yogg-Saron in a while, or never experienced Mimiron on Hard mode, or just need a couple more fragments to construct Val&apos;anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings (http://www.wowdb.com/items/46017), and heading to Storm Peaks. We&apos;re going to work our way through the dungeon on 25-player difficulty, so we want a solid raid of players by your side.<br>

<br>
<br>
Faced with the peril of Yogg-Saron&apos;s imminent freedom, a band of mortals has made preparations for a sweeping assault on the city. Overcoming the legions of iron minions and towering defenses at the city&apos;s entrance will take tremendous strength, but even that great victory may not be enough to overcome the madness that dwells below.<br>
