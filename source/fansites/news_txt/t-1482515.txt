Warlords of Draenor - Profession Catch Up
At Blizzcon and in previous interviews, the developers mentioned that profession catch up mechanisms would be nice to have. It looks like Warlords of Draenor might add those catch up mechanism, as hwoome https://twitter.com/hwoome shared some plans recently.

Battle.Net Desktop App - Chat Coming Soon
We should see the Battle.Net App enable chat http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3273-Battle-net-Desktop-Client-Services-Activated-and-Beta-Test-Opt-in sometime soon, as we recently got an update that let us know it is almost ready! 
Soon, soon!

We initially were going to enable chat before the Diablo 3 expansion launch, but due to some unforeseen issues it had to be delayed.

To ensure the stability of the Diablo 3 expansion launch, we've postponed it until after.

Warlords of Draenor Stats
With Hit/Exp gone, what will the new incentive be for melee to stay behind the boss/mob to DPS?
It's more like the stats are gone from items and everyone gets a passive +7.5% to both. You can still get parried from the front. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439705200740167680
Chance to be parried will be 0%/0%/1.5%/3%, against a +0/+1/+2/+3 level target. Bosses are +3 Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439834754767007744
are inanimate objects like siege crafter weapons still going to parry?
That's encounter-specific, and we generally disable parry where it makes no sense. We missed belt weapons. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439843230020927488

PvE
You mentioned once before about flex modes possibly flexing up to 30 people. That still on the table or still only 25 flex max?
Still on the table. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440561429918138368
30 sounds great. A mythic guild can fit in its entire roster. Still think distributed loot should be mythic only.
Why? Just to stop week one split main/alt loot-funneling runs? WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440617747454521345
agree with about the 30 size being good so no one from roster needing to be left out, disagree with loot thinking.
I'd love to stop week 1 loot funneling, but not at the expense of a social loot experience for the majority. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440619110825607169
In my experience week 1 loot funneling is a problem with very few guilds. Most won't even do it.
Yeah, plenty of 14/14H guilds don't do any of that. It's a niche problem. It does suck though. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440623156609294336

How would this affect loot drops if raid loot is in affect? I'm assuming 30 people would cause more loot drops than 25 or 20?
Right, with 30 you'd see 50% more loot on average than with 20. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440573803651792896
So loot per raid size it'll be: 8-19 people: 1 token + 1 item, 20-29 people: 2 tokens +2 items, 30 people: 3 tokens + 3 items?
No breakpoints like that. The idea is for loot : player ratio to be constant. We'll have more details to share in the future. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440589246278025217

Challenge mode raiding? 6.1 feature? Sounds good to me
Who's the audience for that feature? Seems like it'd be just the tiny sliver of players that has cleared the current Mythic tier. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439800972894674944

Why are they separated into two raids now, as opposed to three? Any particular design reasons?
HoF/ToES split was a bit awkward, especially for the gating, and 10 bosses lets Foundry feel like more of an epic end to the tier. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439045053860683776

PvP
So what about resil and battle fatigue? is it going away?
.Base resil and battle fatigue will be made as low as good gameplay will allow. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439277167797473280
Our goal is to have health pools scale along side damage so we don't have to constantly bump them up. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439277303747448832
If there is 2 dps for every health bar, doesnt that mean damage scales 2x faster then health? Wont the ratio change?
Example: Backstab does 10% of health in first season, 20% in last season. Not really a bracket thing. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439283595392200704

Professions
Can't recall if this was answered elsewhere, but is there a reason Drums of Rage aren't usable in Challenge Modes? Thanks 
We generally bar the use of items/advantages added after the introduction of CMs. Drums should be usable in WoD CMs. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440627988334268416

Lore
and if you don't know, find out.. why are there Ruby Guardians in Grim Batol
Lorewise, Grim Batol was guarded by the red dragonflight before it was retaken by the Twilight's Hammer and black dragonflight. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440113949187375104

World
will wod have a lot of timeless Isle style interaction all over draenor?
Absolutely! From levelling to endgame, we're all about dynamic content and choosing the difficulty that's right for you! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/442169473638756356

Would a system with XP bonuses for killing mobs well above your level be possible? There could be issues with high level carries..
How about an XP bonus for taking on a tough elite or rare in the zone? Doesn't need to be high level to be difficult! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/442500674345922560
Would be also cool if rare elites would drop some transmog gear. For example, rare elites in Talador drop shoulder pads and so on
Used to be worried about inventory space with too many toys and fun stuff, Warlords UI revamp helps a ton! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/442895965679124481

Warlords of Draenor
Hey Ion, just curious about something: will there be daily quests at max level in Warlords too? Not a lot but I do enjoy them.
Daily quests will certainly exist in various forms, but they won't be the backbone of endgame outdoor content as they were in MoP WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439040821711478784

Any chance you can reduce ground spell effects, proc effects and visual "clutter" in melee? Hard to spot char and target facing
Yes. We have big plans to solve this; it's a big problem to us. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442223769604472832
