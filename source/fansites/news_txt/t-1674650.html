Trap Hotfix<br>
Alright. I&apos;m forwarding info from a designer with more information on what we&apos;re working on to increase the amount of elite creatures available for trapping.<br>
<br>
The hotfix that will require a realm restart to take effect to increase the availability of elite creatures by splitting the elites off into its own population group. Previously, the elites and their regular versions shared the same population pool. Splitting the elites off into their own population pool will help them repopulate more quickly.<br>
<br>
However, because the spawn regions for the elites are so wide, players fighting on one end may not see elite creatures repopulating on the other end of the spawn area. To address that, another hotfix is being worked on to greatly increase the number of spawn points with a further increase to the spawn rates. This other hotfix will also require a realm restart so we&apos;re holding off until both hotfixes are ready so the issue can be addressed thoroughly in one go. (You don&apos;t want two separate rolling restarts.)<br>
<br>
With regards to concerns over the change to require tap credit to trap, we think is in part to due the scarcity of elite creatures. With the hotfixes above in place, there should be ample supply and it&apos;ll address those concerns.<br>
<br>
We are looking at making possible further improvements beyond the scope of what hotfixes can allow to the Barn and trapping mechanic to encourage group play and reduce the need to engage in unusual behaviors.

Follower Limits and Accessibility<br>
25 with a level 3 barracks. Anyhow, you can collect them all but you can only have a maximum of 25 active at any one time.<br>
What Doraine said (with the caveat that you may have to switch up certain Garrison buildings and/or Outposts to gain access to certain followers).<br>
<br>
All of this feedback is great so thank you!<br>
<br>
We have some really cool changes coming to Garrisons in the future and a lot of them are based on what you&apos;ve shared with us in recent weeks. Also, I&apos;ve relayed many of the ideas you&apos;ve posted here, too.<br>
<br>
One specific change I can share is in the next patch we&apos;re planning to add a new NPC to tier 3 Garrisons who will sell followers you might not have access to based upon which buildings and Outposts you&apos;ve chosen. Definitely keep an eye out for that on the next PTR, test it out, and let us know what you think.<br>
<br>
Ohhh, what about for followers that came from quests that give you a choice of three but you can only choose 1. Gotta catch&apos;em all you know <br>
Yup! You&apos;ll be able to browse for followers you did not choose from quests and any you might have missed from failed missions.

Warlock Class Balance<br>
I give you credit for replying to this thread. Id love to hear your thoughts on shamans BTW... <br>
<br>
But according to simcraft (Im sure you are aware of the website/tool), warlocks are only ~2k above tanks, and 5k from the top. Big gap.<br>
<br>
Sims can be helpful from time to time, but far more helpful are actual log parses from humans playing those classes, and that tends to be what we look at; as well as just reading feedback, and our own play experience.

New Model Changes and Feedback<br>
We pay attention to the feedback on all articles, as well as all your comments here on the forums. We&apos;re making additional adjustments to some of the new models for the other races, including the Night Elf running animation, thanks to player feedback. <br>
<br>
That&apos;s not to say it&apos;ll be possible to implement every suggestion that was made regarding the Blood Elf models of course, but we&apos;re keen to make sure you love the new models as much as we do.

Please stop making &quot;Spiky thing with a doorhandle&quot;-style fist weapons. They&apos;d spin out of control first hit.<br>

Garrisons<br>
So, is there any good reason why the blueprints for level 2 large buildings cost more than Level 3 blueprints?<br>
Level 3 blueprints require a pretty hefty achievement, topping that with a huge cost felt bad. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/550136858072465409))<br>
That does make a lot of sense, but a 500g discount for time investment doesn&apos;t seem all that much, no?<br>
Some guy was complaining earlier that they didn&apos;t cost enough! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/550158065387831296))<br>

Green Tweets<br>
The developer formerly known as Ghostcrawler has managed to outweet all of the other devs we are tracking combined in the past few days, and had some interesting things to say. Keep in mind he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Classes<br>
in retrospect, was it really worth diluting gameplay quality so that more could participate?<br>
I still struggle with that question. Is it better to have a good experience for few classes or viability for all of them?<br>
giving melee+range comps less DR category overlap is another way.<br>
You can get more class representation by letting multiple classes bring X but then you risk losing class distinction. At the end of the day, supporting multiple diverse classes as equals is almost impossible. My suggestion for any aspiring RPG designers out there is have only a few classes if balance is a goal. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/551199584009994240))<br>
<br>
Must all new classes in WoW be hybrids? Is it bad for the game (LFG queues) to add another pure dps class?<br>
I think the game can support pures, so long as the hybrids are satisfied doing less DPS, which is a hot button topic.<br>
Do you think it&apos;s possible to add a 4th role? Could it be done by adding it to the next new class, and only to that class?<br>
You would make that class mandatory for every raid group. If you could live with that decision, then sure. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552249538291847169))<br>

Misc<br>
I think I transmogged one item, and I was largely the designer of the system. And I found a bug with that one item... I think it was a fan. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552250218616344576))<br>
<br>
what was wow&apos;s biggest problem/headache that you can recall during WotLK?<br>
I don&apos;t know if this is the biggest problem, but creating a niche and need for the DK was a challenge.<br>
interesting. not what i expected.<br>
There were more. Naxx being easy followed by Ulduar being hard was challenging.<br>
I got the feeling Ulduar was not as well received at the time as some portray. The next tier seemed rushed out.<br>
Ulduar was popular for the tiny percent of players who saw it. Flex mode normal would have helped it a ton. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552225539268677632))<br>
<br>
Game Design<br>
No idea how to solve a fundamental game design problem: optional content must be interesting but not so interesting that you&apos;re compelled. I see this is a lot in DA:I and WoW. If optional content is too boring, nobody will do it. Too interesting and it feels no longer optional. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552225333575835648))<br>
<br>
A lot of the optional-turned-mandatory content feels that way because of the presence of overly compelling rewards.<br>
I agree, but it&apos;s not just rewards though. AC and DA:I offer a lot of low reward content that is still hard to skip over.<br>
At some point (was it achievements?) we became programmed to hate skipping over optional activities (frequently collections). (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552226128333529090))<br>
<br>
I would say it all depends on your definition of &apos;interesting&apos;<br>
There is a ton of collection in the new Dragon Age, but many clearly feel bad about not doing it (which is the entire point!). (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552226358332379136))<br>
<br>
Being compelled because it is interesting is awesome. Being compelled to do something optional strictly for reward is no fun<br>
I agree, but there is also a trend of optional never feeling optional no matter how lame or non-rewarding it really is. I am *not* an achievement-focused player, but I still picked up a lot of freaking feathers and posters in Assassins Creed games (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552226614302355456))<br>
<br>
It can be frustrating if it&apos;s presented as optional but is important. It isn&apos;t optional at that point.<br>
Right. Devs are clearly trying to present bonus content for completionists, but then we feel bad skipping it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552227002929778688))<br>
<br>
I can make a game with 1000 quests that feel mandatory. That&apos;s easy (but a lot of work). Having 100 mandatory and 900 optional is harder. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552227482787528705))<br>
<br>
there&apos;s a bigger issue - artists want their art to be seen.<br>
That&apos;s always a concern (and using art = craft) but in this case I believe the devs *want* the content to be optional. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552228481501638656))<br>
<br>
I will never play DA:I again because of this and I really wanted to <br>
Exactly. Bioware wanted shards and other collections to feel optional for folks who wanted a 200h game. But I think it backfired. You hear complaints of too much content, even from crazy gamers like us. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552228938315866112))<br>
<br>
But what if you want to offer 100h to one type of player and 40h to another? How to make *some* content feel optional? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552229309343997952))<br>
<br>
WoW had TONS of working optional content. you could do pet battles. or start doing dailies to get the squirre pony from TotC<br>
WoW pets are a great example. They went from rare rewards for a few to something many had the expectation they were going to get. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552232925593219072))<br>
<br>
I&apos;d prefer if games were made directed at a specific audience. People would enjoy them more. Even if it was less people<br>
Budgets can be a challenge there. Unless your specific audience will pay a premium for the game, you have to make it smaller. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552249311048654848))<br>
<br>
IMO, if you make content interesting, people will feel compelled to complete it, &quot;optional&quot; or no.<br>
But what if it is not? What if it is an awful grind? I assert many will still do it (and be mad). (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552250556052275202))<br>
<br>
devs seem to think &quot;it&apos;s optional but we&apos;d still like EVERYONE to do it&quot;. &quot;Optional&quot; means many ppl WONT do it- AND THAT&apos;S OK<br>
Yes, that is my point. It is good to have optional content. Keeping it optional is surprisingly hard to design. You almost find yourself trying to design somewhat shitty content for fear that everyone will do it (meaning now non-optional). (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552251084538785792))<br>
<br>
Isn&apos;t this solved via multiple possible paths? You get one option, and you have to play again to explore other options?<br>
I like that the best, though it is strictly more work/content than the main+optional model. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552296433534377984))<br>
<br>
But is that not the purpose of all gaming companies. To hook the gamer in and keep them coming in.<br>
Ultimately, but you do risk driving players away if they are overwhelmed. It&apos;s a big ask to say &quot;Trust me. The 100 hours you are about to spend will be worth it.&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552297022146232320))<br>
<br>
that&apos;s the problem with you people. You have to always overcomplicate things. I bet none of this was important on vanilla WoW<br>
Leveling to 60 was the entire game for most players and they didn&apos;t rush through it. Player behavior changes in 10 years. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552475043142578177))</div></div>
