Conquest Vendors Temporarily Disabled<br>
We are aware of an issue affecting a number of players that caused them to have an unusually high Conquest Point cap. Conquest vendors have been temporarily disabled while we work on a fix to correct this. Conquest Points obtained in excess of the 2200 point cap will be lost and we&apos;ll be removing the Grievous Conquest achievement from any characters that managed to obtain it.<br>
<br>
The vendors will be made available again once the fix is in place.<br>

Norushen Bugged<br>
Wanted to chime in and let you know that we&apos;re looking into a possible issue where the incorrect targets were being picked for Look Within on Raid Finder.

Feldrake as a Ground Mount<br>
The Feldrake (http://www.wowdb.com/items/79771-feldrake) having ground mount functionality was originally a bug. When the bug got fixed for all drakes, that functionality got removed. A hotfix is being worked on to add ground mount functionality back in for the Feldrake.
