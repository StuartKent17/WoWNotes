It also no longer triggers from the Bomb Talents, and instead has a 10% chance to trigger from Frostbolt  casts. Each Multistrike of Frostbolt  increases that cast's chance by an additional 25% 45%.

Warlords of Draenor - Quest Markers on the World Map
Starting in Talador, you'll soon start seeing quest bangs on the world map for major quest lines that you are eligible for but don't have in progress. Other zones will follow shortly after.

This system is designed to act as a backup mechanism should you fall off of a quest line for some reason. While it is not terrible if you're guided to content this way, it is still our preference that we lead you there smoothly through the quests themselves, and only have this as a backup should you miss something.

We're very interested in hearing feedback on this system as you start to experience it. Also, if you somehow miss a major quest and end up depending on these map bangs to lead you back, we'd still love to hear about those too so that we can look to reduce the chances of missing them.

Thank you for your help with this. We hope you enjoy this new feature.

Warlords of Draenor Theorycraft Discussion
Is there a formula or "rules of thumb" for determining a targets hitbox size and geometry?
Shape is always circular. Creature hitbox varies, of course. Player hitboxes are consistent though the exact size rarely matters I believe it's 0.5yd radius. 

What actually matters is combat reach. That's always 1.5yd for players, and larger for larger creatures. The distance away that you can attack a creature is...

Melee attack: MAX5, SourceCombatReach + TargetCombatReach + 4/3 + IfSourceAndTargetAreRunning8/3
Ranged attack: SourceCombatReach + TargetCombatReach + AttackRange + IfSourceAndTargetAreRunning2
AoE: TargetCombatReach + AttackRadius + IfSourceIsRunning2 Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Have you ever considered instead of tweaking individual abilities to give everyone a "tuning" passive ability?
Yeah, we have that under the hood for emergencies see Brewmasters on live. Results in a more cohesive game if we don't tho. Celestalon 

From a healer's perspective where will incoming tank damage be in Warlords' raids? More attention needed than MoP? Wrath? =
More than MoP. Celestalon 

There is a difference between a spec needing balance and most players idea of "competitive".
People tweet me all the time with questions like, "Do you intend for <spec> to be lackluster this <exp/tier>?" So silly. Celestalon 
"No, we're shooting for abysmal. More tuning to come!"
Haha. I'll use this next time I'm feeling especially snarky. Celestalon 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Frost DKs: 2H will prefer to use KM on Oblit, and DW on FS, as has been intended for a while but tuning was off in late MoP. Celestalon 
We know this, but there is no incentive wait for OB to come off CD to use KM on it. Its a dmg loss right now for doing so.
Right, that's the part about "tuning was off in late MoP". Celestalon 
how's it a tuning issue?
It was not tuned to be worth it. That's a tuning issue. Celestalon 
It's a mechanical issue. Not a tuning issue. Have to use runes to start the feedback loop.
So? Celestalon 
Therefore KM can never "matter" to 2H Frost. Useless mechanic.
Extreme example: Triple Oblit's damage. Now you will prefer to use KMs on Oblits. Celestalon 
another example You are empty on runes w/ only runic power. You will still use KM on FS.
Yes. That's why I said *prefer to*, not *only*. Celestalon 
What will make Obl worth using in WoD for DW frost dk's?With enough mastery howling blast will do more dmg cause frost dmg scale
Rime helps with this. Celestalon 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Whats the intent of Tiger's Fury change? Removal of need for macro? Concerned about PvP burst with midberserk TF for more nrg?
You already could combine them as long as you knew to use TF first. It was a pointless limitation. Celestalon 

Pool up to 100 -> Berserk -> Dump to 40 -> TF -> Dump to 0.
Sure, you'll do that, which we're fine with. It's damage that you're going to use on Bite; worst Energy->Damage conversion. Celestalon 

Can you expand a bit on the new MF/SF eclipse changes? Did the snapshot idea not work? I like the changes I'm just curious.
Yeah, Eclipse is no longer snapshot. As such, you can now afford to use MF/SF as mobile damage options, without reducing DoT dmg. Celestalon 
So, it looks like you recast the dots right before hitting opposite Eclipse to maintain uptime? At least MF.
You can't recast both at any time. You only need to MF once at peak, and SF once at peak and once at start/end of Solar Celestalon 

Is Shooting Stars 5% for most recent MF and SF, or 5% for just whichever of those is most recently applied?
5% for both. Celestalon 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
liking the new hunter raid CD, even if it doesn't benefit them
It does, a little. Powershot and Focusing Shot. Celestalon 

With the new Aspect of the Fox, could we have a little clarity on "all spells"?Will it include abilities like Focusing Shots?
Yes. I'll clarify the tooltip with "and abilities". Celestalon 
Thank yooou, and one more question.Does it include items i.e hearthstone?
Yes. Celestalon 

Oh, hay. Is a dps cool down still being considered for SV?
Not beyond what's in the talent tree and effectively available through ES pooling. Celestalon 

is the new fox cd on global or off?
In an upcoming build it'll be off the global, and usable while casting something else like Spiritwalker's Grace is. WatcherDev 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
any concerns that Empowered Seals force reti and protto juggle seals to keep all 2/3 buffs active or is the intended game play?
That's the intention. Celestalon 
any plans to make it feel less clunky atm created alot of seal switch reminds me of warrior stance dance
No, that's the point; it's a talent to let you opt into seal twisting. Celestalon 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Is Grimoire of Synergy going to have ICD?
No. Celestalon 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Is there a reason Dragon Roar is not on the AoE Knockback list for diminishing returns?
I believe because of the extremely short nature of it; it'd be a penalty use, instead of a benefit. Same as the Charge stun. Celestalon 

that was specifically TC damage going down 30%, not all damage. Though arms could probably use a flat 30% cut
Yeah, I just meant TC damage going down 30%. All Arms damage is still going to go down across the board too, though. Celestalon 

ie is TClap down to 10 rage now, with WW at 20, or is Tclap still at 15 while WW is 20?
TClap at 10, WW at 20, MS at 20, Execute will use up to 30 additional rage instead of 50 same total dmg. Slam is slightly... Celestalon 
...different; couldn't really reduce the rage cost of a 10 rage ability by 1/3. so instead increased its damage by 50%. Celestalon 
is tclap intended to be used single target for arms now unless you take the slam talent?
No, it's still much worse damage than WW. Tclap is primarily for the snare. Celestalon 
Any chances TC radius glyph will make a return? Piercing howl has 15 yards radius. Fury won't have aoe snare?
The WW range glyph will also apply to TC. Celestalon 

PvE
Any chance we might see Elite difficulty fights in WoD? Like Protectors in ToES. Loved Yogg Saron, would like to see more
No specific plan in place for the 6.0 raid content, but it's something we can/will do where it makes sense. WatcherDev 

Lore
Would you consider Khadgar, based on his views and persona, to be an Alliance character? Is he in the Alliance for convieniece?
Khadgar is an Alliance character willing to give quests to individual Horde heroes he trusts. DaveKosak 

I don't get this. I can understand khadgar being neutral aligned because of his Outland experiences but the KT has never been fully neutral except in world-threatening circumstances. 3 of the 6 members of the current council of six were there when kael was thrown into the violet hold. Jaina does more face heel turns than a catwalk model but I think khadgar would be way outvoted
He is. But that doesn't stop him from doing his thing. Would love to be a fly on the wall in Council meetings! DaveKosak 

Hey any chance Exarch Naielle, Exarch Malaadar, and Yrel come back to the main universe and possibly exarch akama as well?
Not determined yet! We'll see what people think of the exarchs. You'll meet other rangari in other zones, as well. DaveKosak 

Garrisons
A question: Will keeping the Trading Post be required to keep the exalted status with Laughing Skull/Shattari Defense?
Not as planned, no. Some buildings can be exhausted and then replaced over the course of the expac. Muffinus
