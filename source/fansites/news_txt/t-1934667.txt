Legion - Tyrande, Malfurion, and Elothir
We found some interesting references to Tyrande, Malfurion, and Elothir. Unfortunately there isn't much more than what is below yet. Keep in mind that this is just a reference in an alpha build of Legion, not something final or officially announced. Spoilers below!

The vision is chaotic, unfocused. I need to concentrate.
I will need to focus on the vision to understand its message. Guard me while I do this, $n.
Yes, Tyrande.
Do not let anything disturb my meditation. I must see through the chaos.
I see... swirling red mist. Gnashing teeth.
That is Malfurion's voice! He is livid and... in terrible agony.
Such malevolent laughter... who could be so cruel?
I only pray that we are not too late.
The corruption is getting worse. There is something across the bridge... Is that the Archdruid Elothir?
By Elune... what happened, Elothir? Have you seen my husband?
The Nightmare... claims me. Malfurion calls out in the darkness. I cannot see him...
You must help me find him! Is there anything I can do?
You may not, but perhaps... your mother moon can.
I will petition Elune. The Nightmare taint cannot be removed.... but perhaps we can hold it back.
Long enough... to seek him out... *Elothir groans* The trees whisper nonsense. I can almost understand...
Hold yourself on the edge of madness, Elothir! Mother moon will hold you as long as she can.
He approaches the heart of corruption! Quickly, Tyrande, to Shala'nir! There is no time!
I will go to him! Elothir?
The madness... claims me...
Elothir's form is unresponsive. The Nightmare has taken hold.
Elothir's inert form stares blankly into the distance.
Elothir appears completely unaware of his surroundings.
There is no time to lose. Elothir is beyond our reach now. Come with me.
Shala'nir is just ahead. When we arrive, you will search the buildings to the left. I will search those to the right. Shout if you find him.
I am coming Malfurion!
I hear a struggle by the gazebo! Malfurion?! Answer me!
Hah! Claim him if you can, Night Elf!


New Item Added to World of Warcraft: Legion Digital Deluxe Bonuses
We’ve added something new to the collection of goodies you get when you purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition of World of Warcraft: Legion. Take on the terrors of Diablo III in style with the Legion-inspired Demon Hunter helm transmog. Wear it with the Wings of the Betrayer, and you’ll truly look the part as you hunt demons across Sanctuary. Both of these items, along with everything else in the Digital Deluxe Edition, are available in-game now when you pre-purchase.


  

Don’t be caught unprepared for the Burning Legion’s assault on Azeroth beginning this summer. By pre-purchasing now, you’ll receive a level-100 character boost to use immediately, along with early access to the Demon Hunter hero class prior to the expansion’s release.*

PRE-PURCHASE NOW 

World of Warcraft: Legion is filled with features and content that will transform Azeroth’s heroes into Legion-slaying avatars of vengeance, including:


New Hero Class: Demon Hunter—Unleash the demon within as an all-new melee hero class gifted with preternatural mobility—and the ability to metamorphose into hellish new forms.
New Feature: Artifact Weapons—Smite the Legion with class-specific weapons of lore. Unlock awesome abilities and traits, and customize your weapon to suit your needs.
New Continent: The Broken Isles—Discover the fate of a lost night elf civilization, confront twisted fragments of the Emerald Nightmare, and hunt agents of the Legion in all-new zones.

New Feature: Class Halls aka Order Halls—Unite fellow NPC members of your class’s order to carry out missions at your command.
New PvP Honor System—Fight for fame, glory, and a range of new PvP-specific powers as you face the opposing faction in Arenas and Battlegrounds.


Digital Deluxe Edition – Pets, Mounts, and More
In addition to the Standard Edition, the new expansion is available in a Digital Deluxe Edition, which contains a cache of Legion-inspired in-game bonuses for World of Warcraft and other Blizzard games available upon or before the expansion’s launch, including:


World of Warcraft – Illidari Felstalker Mount and Nibbles Pet—Stalk the invading demonic forces atop one of the Burning Legion’s own twisted hounds of war, and summon a delightfully demented companion to keep you warm by the fel fire—both available immediately upon pre-purchase.


Heroes of the Storm – Felstalker Mount—Charge down the lanes of the Nexus and wreak havoc on the opposing team astride this fierce fanged terror.
StarCraft II – Fel Protoss Portraits—Take back Aiur in infernal style with psionic-infused StarCraft II portraits of Illidan and Gul’dan.
Diablo III – Wings of the Betrayer—Equip your hero with Illidan’s wings and strike terror into the hearts of Sanctuary’s demons.
NEW! Diablo III – Demon Hunter Helm Transmog—Complete your fel-infused look with the new Demon Hunter helm transmog. Just add wings and you’ll be the true terror of Sanctuary.

Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Besides, how many people actually have "the Insane" in WoW? Pretty small percent, and that's pure dedication.
That one is, but I'd argue the prestige is pretty small. Now imagine it granted a legendary.... OccupyGStreet 

Well, he also conceded that maybe it's not feasible.
Yeah. I think there is an expectation that only a few people can wield say Excalibur, but maybe not in an MMO OccupyGStreet
