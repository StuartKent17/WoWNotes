Stoy2019-09-03, 05:45 PMWoW Classic Free Character Moves Coming Soon
We are working to open our Free Character Move service for select WoW Classic realms in the coming days.

When free character moves become available from one of the most highly-populated realms, players will see the option to initialize a free character move on either the character select screen or the queue screen of the realm.

To best prepare, please note that a character cannot move if the character:


is a guild leader.
has active auction listings or bids.
has mail.


We will post full details about the realms available and character restrictions when we open the service.
