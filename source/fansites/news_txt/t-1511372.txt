This interview is ongoing, so check back later for the completed notes!



Blizzplanet

Orcs will come through the Dark Portal and take over Blackrock Mountain in the Warlords of Draenor world event.
The alliance will work with Velen, Akama, and Maraad in Shadowmoon Valley. 
Assaults on your garrison will happen repeatedly, and get harder as time goes on. You will keep upgrading the item level of your followers. 
You will have to make many choices about the buildings in your garrison as you level through the zones.
After boosting to 90, all of the things in your bags will be mailed to you. The mail has an unlimited duration, so you can sort through those things whenever you want.
Flexible size raids will allow you to have anywhere from 10 to 30 players in a raid.

Can you please consider the over-simplifying you all are doing to the game. You will lose even more subscribers if you proceed.
A Threatening sub loss got old a looong time ago. B Read our reasoning in the patch notes; we're removing complexity, not depth. Celestalon 
I would have to disagree. DoT Snapshotting was one of the only things that gave DPS depth, or skill for that matter.
We agree, in theory, but not in practice. In practice, an addon did it. That wasn't removed as part of ability pruning anyway. Celestalon 
Weren't we told over and over again that snapshotting was going away? Was this idea reverted?
No...? Celestalon 

Is the Gladiator's Resolve talent an experiment that might get expanded to other tank classes eventually? #BloodDPS
Possibly. Not for Warlords, but it is an experiment that we're eager to see the results of, so to speak. Celestalon 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
My concern is that very few top level death knights take RE. I'll admit I don't have data to back this up however.
It's more than you may think, but still not high. Overall, yes, this row is OK. All get some play, with RE being the least. And... Celestalon 
...we think that will be improved a bit by having some spare GCDs in your rotation. Celestalon 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
WoD: Without Vengeance and changes to Arcane - Arcane AoE sounds like suicide. Comments?
Tanks will generate about as much threat as they do today under most circumstances; AoEing tanked mobs shouldn't be an issue. WatcherDev 
And fights like Dark Shamans? This AoE change just screams death to me. :c
Which AoE change in particular do you mean, just so we're clear? WatcherDev 

Have we seen everything in terms of new abilities/passives/perks non-talent stuff for mages?
Well Alpha isn't Release; things may still change. But no more new abilities currently planned. Celestalon 
I see. Considered giving PoM to Fire so Combustion is more controllable burst like Arcane Power/IV? Or intentional difference?
Intentional difference. Don't want to have SO much of your damage concentrated into that one 10sec period. Celestalon 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Avengers Shield used to silence all targets struck. Seems it only does the initial target now. Will it go back in WoD?
No plans to, no. It's more power than is needed. Celestalon 

You mentioned that H-Paladins would keep the 10% haste from SoI. Why opt for haste instead of just lowering cast times baseline?
Haste is more easily understood. We don't normally do faster cast times for specific specs often. Also, haste reduces the GCD too Celestalon 
Is haste reducing gcd for all class/specs? If so are paladins getting something in place of this perk?
Haste has always reduced the GCD for spells, for everyone. Celestalon 

PvE
Are we ever going to see 10man only raids like Karazhan and Zul'Aman again?
No current plans for fixed-side 10-player raids -- what is the appeal to you of a raid that allows 10, but not 11, 12, etc? WatcherDev 

but it would be a lot more useful in LFR? why have it for dungeons and not lfr?
Heroic dungeons in particular will be more challenging than LFR, and one unprepared player can have a greater negative impact. WatcherDev 

My nhc raid is just plain stuck at 14/14. We are old folks with jobs/kids etc. We will not improve our game much more.
If you can kill Garrosh, you absolutely should be able to do at least the first 8 on the next difficulty up. Have you tried? WatcherDev 

Please give us bosses tuned around Garrosh NHC that we can progress on. Immerseus HC is too easy, anything beyond too hard.
Are you a 25-player or 10-player group? Fallen Protectors and Norushen should be well within reach if you've killed Garrosh. WatcherDev 
thx for your reply. we are 25man. we spent some time on norushen, but even with quite aggressive healer/dps ratios...>
Fallen Protectors is probably a better next step on 25H; try making He and Sun transition simultaneously if you haven't been. WatcherDev 
Thx again, we will try that. I read from your response that there are no zone buffs/debuffs planned for T16. Thx Digerati, too.
Correct, there's no zonewide aura planned. We're keeping an eye on overall progression rates in case targeted nerfs are needed WatcherDev 

PvP
Disagree, I actually enjoy playing 2v2. Not as much as I did back in TBC, but I still have fun with it...
2v2 is more accessible. Less people to track. Feel like Dampening was important change for that bracket. holinka 
I haven't played much post-dampening change tbh. But I'm curious, will dampening change in WoD?
We're pretty happy with Dampening. Starting at 5 minutes in 3s is still on the table. holinka 

Will Rated battlegrounds get spectator mode as well?
Yes holinka 
Awesome stuff. Although will people use to to cheat to check on rogue ambushes at nodes?
Spectator mode is geared towards people that want to broadcast tournaments. holinka 

Ever considered doing a BG where the goal is within a certain time limit, most kills win?
you never know holinka 

Professions
I'm a little worried about Engineering in WoD after interview. I'd love more info on this!
What in particular worries you about it? WatcherDev 
it sounds like they're turning into enchants anyone can use, and are interchangeable with potions? I like that its unique to eng
Engineering will keep some personal toys and fun stuff. The main thing that's changing is just Nitro Boost. WatcherDev 
so in effect, everyone gets a speed boost every 3 mins? not saying it's a bad thing, but will have an impact on button bloat.
The thought is to actually have that particular effect be on the potion cooldown. Intravenous Swiftness Potion, basically. WatcherDev 

You think sharing with Synapse Springs would be more fitting? Both 'lore'-wise and to be dps forgiving. 3 mins is a long time
Synapse Springs are gone, as part of the general disarmament of passive/rotational DPS perks from professions. WatcherDev 

Garrisons
Will MoP farming be coming in WoD somehow? I enjoy farming and don't want to see it die in Wod.
Your Draenor garrison has a farm plot, though your friends from Sunsong Ranch will remain there. WatcherDev
