Shadowmourne Changes
The proc of Shadowmourne  was slightly modified. The Soul Fragment  you get from the proc now grants 30 strength down from 40 but the "final" proc now grants you 270 strength for 10 sec.

The Frostwing Halls
The last wing of the Icecrown Citadel unlocks this week! Valithria Dreamwalker , Sindragosa  and the Lich King see below will be available!


   


The Lich King Encounter
The spells used during the lich king encounter are now available as well. We don't really know how it will work for the moment but the spells look promising. Note: I cannot guarantee that all these spells will be used during the fight against the lich king. 

Also, I do realize that Hellscream's Warsong  and Strength of Wrynn  are spells used during the Battle for Undercity questline, new versions have been added and it looks like they could be used during the encounter. That's probably the only way players will have to survive the devastating attacks of the Lich King. 

They could also be the promised zone-wide and optional buffs designed to make Icecrown Citadel easier over time.

 Druid Forums  / Talent Calculator 
Balance
Earth and Moon: This talent now increases the druid’s spell damage by 2/4/6%, up from 1/2/3%.

 Shaman Forums  / Talent Calculator 
Elemental Combat
Shamanism: This talent now provides 4/8/12/16/20% extra spell damage to Lightning Bolt/Chain Lightning, up from 3/6/9/12/15%, and 5/10/15/20/25% to Lava Burst, up from 4/8/12/16/20%.

 Warlock Forums  / Talent Calculator 
Affliction
Shadow Embrace: This effect can now stack up to 3 times, up from 2. However, the periodic healing reduction effect has been reduced from 3/6/9/12/15% to 2/4/6/8/10% per application.

Demonology
Demonic Pact: The damage bonus granted the warlock by this talent has been increased from 1/2/3/4/5% to 2/4/6/8/10%. The buff granted to a raid or party by this talent remains unchanged.

Destruction
Conflagrate: The damage-over-time effect of Conflagrate has been increased to 40% of the spell’s total damage, up from 20%.
Empowered Imp: The pet bonus damage provided by this talent has been increased to 10/20/30%, up from 5/10/15%.
Improved Shadow Bolt: Damage done by Shadow Bolt increased by 2/4/6/8/10%, up from 1/2/3/4/5%.

 Warrior Forums  / Talent Calculator 
Protection
Concussion Blow: The damage done by this ability has been reduced by 50%, but its threat generation will remain approximately the same.
Devastate: This ability now deals 120% of weapon damage, up from 100% of weapon damage.
Shield Slam: The damage scaling from block value for this ability now diminishes faster and diminishes starting at a lower block value. The difference should be negligible for players in high-end tanking armor. In addition, the threat caused by Shield Slam has been increased by 30%.
Warbringer: This talent no longer allows Charge and Intercept to break roots or snares. Intervene remains unaffected.

User Interface
The party leader is now referred to as Guide in chat when a group is formed via the Dungeon Finder.
Fixed a bug where players with Raid Assist capabilities were unable to perform a Ready Check.
Fixed a bug where the first couple of tutorials were not displaying upon logging into the game.

Items
New strength-based melee DPS rings are now available from representatives of the Ashen Verdict.
Tier-9 Sets: The Aspirant vendors at the Argent Tournament grounds have worked out a deal with merchants in Dalaran so that all item level 232 set pieces will now be available on armor vendors in the city. Set pieces which require trophies will still be available for purchase only from vendors at the Argent Tournament grounds.
Tier-10 Balance Druid 4-Piece Bonus: Fixed a bug to allow for this bonus to properly trigger.
Tier-10 Elemental Shaman 4-Piece Set Bonus: Redesigned. Successful Lava Burst casts now increase the duration of Flame Shock on the target by 6 seconds.
Tier-10 Tank Sets: The gloves and chest pieces for warrior, death knight, and paladin tanks have had their stats adjusted slightly to provide additional armor value.
Tier-10 Warlock 4-Piece Bonus: This bonus should now correctly be applied to the warlock’s pet.

Technical Support
The cvar ‘processAffinityMask’ controls which CPU cores are available for the World of Warcraft client to use. Previously the game client was limited to 2 cores as a default which players could override in the configuration file. In the past this provided a performance boost on some CPUs and operating systems. We have identified several systems that are experiencing severe performance issues with this restriction and have removed it. Players who would like to restore the old behavior can do so by updating the Config.WTF file by adding: SET processAffinityMask "3".


Tier-10 Tank Armor Changes
We recognize that many plate tanks are making their gear choices based on the amount of armor they’re provided, as this is currently the most preferred stat. In order to make the tier-10 plate tanking sets more desirable, we will be adjusting the stats on the gloves and chest pieces in order to inflate the amount of armor they provide in the next minor patch. This will apply to all item levels of the tier-10 death knight, warrior, and paladin tanking gloves and chest pieces.

Similar items crafted or purchased with Emblems of Frost will continue to be very good and will compare favorably to all but the Heroic difficulty boss loot, so you shouldn't despair if you recently acquired any of those.
