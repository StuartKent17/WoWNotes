Today&apos;s mount ... isn&apos;t really a mount actually. In the current build of the WotLK beta, people dying in Storm Peaks are resurrected on a ghost flying mount (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/august/spectralgryphon.jpg) ! Running to your corpse could be very hard in a region with so many mountains and developpers solved it by giving you a very nice mount. Obviously, its only purpose is to make corpse running easier in the zone and it fades off once you&apos;re back among the living. <br>

<br>
Lake Wintergrasp Upcoming Changes<br>
We&#x2019;re hoping to get the zone into better shape in the next couple patches. Here&#x2019;s a few things that should be coming in the next build:<br>
<br>
&#x2022; All vehicles should be despawn after the battle ends<br>
&#x2022; Demolisher and Siege Vehicle health has been reduced by 50-75%<br>
&#x2022; Demolisher and Siege Vehicle ram attacks no longer knock a player high enough to kill them<br>
&#x2022; Jet &amp; Bomber health has been reduced<br>
&#x2022; Bomber damage has been increased<br>
&#x2022; Players in Bombers should no longer take damage<br>
&#x2022; Reward for holding the keep has been added<br>
&#x2022; The Goblin Workshops in the North and South now also supply players with land mines that deal bonus damage to tanks<br>
<br>
We also hope to have a system for rewarding only players that participated in the battle working soon. <br>

Profession recipes collection achievements<br>
We&apos;re working on the ability to do these kind of achievements. We wouldn&apos;t do anything percentage based but rather choose a flat number and add more achievements as we add more content.<br>
<br>
Most likely, you&apos;ll see a cooking version like this in the near future. Versions for the primary professions won&apos;t go live until account-based achievements are active. We don&apos;t want to encourage people picking up and dropping profressions simply to gain achievements. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/9244877181-profession-recipe-collection.html))<br>

Feats of Strength - Spirit of Competition 2008<br>
Great idea. We implemented two Feats... one for the Tabard and one for the Pet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/9336453693-suggestion-spirit-of-competition-08-feat.html))<br>

Anticipation / Shamanistic Focus changes / Windfury concerns<br>
One change we&apos;re doing to Anticipation is changing it to 3-points, and giving it disarm reduction. We are also most likely going to change Shamanistic Focus to make it a flat mana reduction in shock cooldowns. It&apos;s too spammy right now, and the class has too many on proc buffs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/8765613341-malans-enhancementapalooza-8770.html))<br>
<br>
Edit: BTW, one thing I totally agree with is the Windfury Weapon concern. We&apos;ll see if we can make the ability less complicated/&quot;mathy&quot;. <br>

Warlock changes and Patch 3.0 Deployment<br>
We&apos;ll be doing some considerable work on Warlocks before that patch hits. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/9237587159-content-patchnot-good.html))<br>

Furious Attacks<br>
This talent will see some revision before retail so don&apos;t worry about a world where warriors are dual wielding daggers for MS bonanzas. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/9023731954-furious-attacks-overpowered.html))<br>
