TheCrafticus  was at Dragoncon and talked about Legion! MMO-Central  and Elvine  were also there and live tweeted  the whole thing.

Classes

Demon Hunters are starting at Level 98 right now.
Death Knights will continue to start at Level 55.
Demon Hunters will have a short transform, with inner demon visuals.
Only Demon Hunters will be able to use glaives. 
Double jump won't be disabled anywhere.
Survival Hunters will get a Harpoon ability that allows them to throw a spear to pull mobs towards them.
Most specs are getting overhauled, tweaking them to fit the fantasy of the spec. Some will be renamed.
Some specs will use a renamed resource, such as Insanity for Shadow Priest.
The sewer class hall for Rogues looks great, not really like a sewer at all. It will have treasure chests. 
The Moonkin model will be updated.
No new major glyphs will be added.
No Gnome hunters yet, maybe when it makes sense to add them.


Professions

There will be a "single system" to upgrade profession items. The current item will be destroyed, giving you a reagent needed for the upgrade Obliterium. 
A new team will be working on professions this time, including profession quest lines.
Professions will get some crafting items from dungeon loot.
Professions won't have daily cooldowns.
Prospecting could make a return.


Transmog / Items / Stats

If the new transmog system is account wide, the item must be usable by the class trying to use it.
No tabard tab is currently planned, but the new transmog system should help to clear up some space.
Multistrike is being removed and other secondary stats will have changes as well.
Players can still only equip three profession crafted items.
There won't be specific item art for each race and class, as Artifact weapon art is the priority. 


Misc

Dungeons will absolutely be relevant again.
Illidan is ready to lead Demon Hunters against the Burning Legion.
The Park in Stormwind won't be repaired yet.
There are plans for Jaina. 
The backpack might be updated.
Warlords was not a filler expansion and built some things that will be used going forward.

PvP
General

Fixed an issue where players were not transforming correctly into the opposite faction in Mercenary Mode.
Players with the Mercenary Contract effect should now be able to use faction mounts while in an Arena Skirmish, Rated Arena match, or Rated Battleground.
Fixed an issue where Rated Battleground faction auras were incorrectly applied while in the Arena.


Bug Fixes

Fixed an issue where some characters were unable to complete bonus objectives.



Legion - Moonkin Model Update
Sounds like thereâ€™s been a misunderstanding somewhere here. Our current plan is that Moonkin Form will indeed receive a high-res model update in Legion.
