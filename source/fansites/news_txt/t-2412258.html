Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
So, as you&#x2019;ve noticed, today&#x2019;s patch release has not gone nearly as smoothly as we would have liked. We&#x2019;re sorry for how this has affected the stability and playability of the game while these issues have been ongoing. This has obviously not been the launch that any of us wanted.<br>
<br>
That said, we want you to know that there are currently several teams of people working hard to get you back in Azeroth and enjoying the Battle for Azeroth Pre-Patch as quickly as possible. We&#x2019;ll share more details in this thread when we can.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your patience,<br>
<br>
The World of Warcraft Team<br>
<br>
As we work to identify the cause of these issues, we will be temporarily disabling the World of Warcraft Communities feature. The in-game and guild chat channels will still be available for use. The Guild Calendar may also be missing events while we address these concerns.</div></div>
