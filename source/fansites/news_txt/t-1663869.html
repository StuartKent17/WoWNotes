WoWProgress Rules Change<br>
It appears that WoWProgress has added a new rule (http://www.wowprogress.com/post/163_Abusing_realm_transfers_-_2) for rankings going forward that will not include guilds that realm transfer to buy gear from the BMAH. <br>

Upcoming Garrison Outpost Hotfixes<br>
We&#x2019;ve been working on a solution to the issues with swapping buildings that some players have reported. Tomorrow&#x2019;s restarts will fix several issues, but there are two outstanding issues that will have to be corrected in a future hotfix. In the meantime, we want to make sure players are aware of the issues so that you can avoid them.<br>
<br>
Alliance players who changed outpost buildings in Spires of Arak prior to tomorrow&apos;s restarts will not be able to access the new building&#x2019;s questline. Horde players who change outpost buildings in Talador will be unable to change their building a second time. The gold cost will be charged, but the building will instantly revert back.<br>
Aside from those two issues, we believe the fix applied with tomorrow&#x2019;s restarts will resolve all other issues with changing outpost buildings. The outstanding issues will be fixed as soon as possible.<br>

Are you aware that the 25% chaos bolt pvp nerf introduced in 5.3 was never reverted even though resilience no longer exists?<br>
Untrue. It was reverted. We&apos;ve tested it multiple times. But crit damage is reduced by 25% in PvP in WoD. Just buffed CB. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/544320974519558145))<br>

Achievements<br>
I was of the understanding that Blizz only wanted achievements that were achievable, hence introduction of Feats of Strength. now except the Ordos one. Very very frustrating, and I hope you understand <br>
Ordoes ones should be FOS now, you&apos;re correct, will fix. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/544368731724341249))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
I&apos;ve never spoken to anyone who has received conquest from a gold box in BGs. This was supposed to be a feature of WOD.What&apos;s up?<br>
We had to remove it from boxes last minute. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/544352838139543552))<br>

Lore<br>
Hello, can you help get something settled? Is this (http://wow.gamepedia.com/The_Schools_of_Arcane_Magic_-_Enchantment) non-canon? And if it is canon, why is it canon? What I&apos;m trying to ask is, Enchanting is called a School of the Arcane in this book, does this mean Enchanting is not a School of Fel? Items can be enchanted w/ Fel energy, so can Enchanters be those who use Fel energy to enchant stuff?<br>
Enchanting probably uses several magical disciplines. Didn&apos;t we have shadow enchants at one point? (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/544645996777447425))<br>

Where are the Shamans on Draenor? I play Alliance, so I&apos;m sure it&apos;s a factor, but exposure to Shamanism is very limited thus far.<br>
The Draenei in this period hadn&apos;t learned shamanism yet. It was the broken draenei who turned to shamanism after their fall. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/544959502169026561))<br>

Garrisons<br>
What&apos;s your stance on follower trait re-rolls as opposed to the re-roll item for both traits and abilities?<br>
Cool suggestion, we&apos;ve heard a lot about re-rolling, thanks for the notes all! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/544728585005576192))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
Do the Iron Warchiefs have mandatory job-training workshops on standing in imposing postures while in a group?<br>
just offscreen, Garrosh was coaching them all. &quot;Line up - a little to the left Ner&apos;zhul - yes! Hold it!&quot; (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/544645634905501696))</div></div>
