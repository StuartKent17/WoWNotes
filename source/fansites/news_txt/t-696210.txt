Boubouille2010-02-17, 10:35 PMUpdate 02/18 - The WoW TCG Announcement was from Upper Deck International http://www.upperdeck-international.com/ UDI, this company is slightly different from Upper Deck http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/ UDE in North America. UDE has NOT generated a press release on the situation yet and any information about the situation should come from Blizzard. Apparently they are "working with Blizzard to ensure a smooth transition of the brand and its assets so that no one riles up any WoW TCG gamers in the process". 

Pandaren Monk Sales raises $1.1M for Make-A-Wish Foundation
On Tuesday, Feb. 16, we were honored to host a special event at our Irvine, Calif. headquarters to mark the donation of more than $1.1 million to the Make-A-Wish Foundation and Make-A-Wish Foundation International, two organizations that grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions in 36 countries around the world. 

This donation, which was based on 50 percent of the total sales during November and December of the Pandaren Monk pet for World of Warcraft, was ultimately made possible by the World of Warcraft community. We appreciate the support the community showed for this important cause. 

As part of yesterday's event, we invited 15 wish children and their families to tour the Blizzard campus, meet with the World of Warcraft development team, and participate in a variety of fun activities. Check out the press release http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/press/pressreleases.html?100217 to read more about the event, and visit the Make-A-Wish Foundation http://www.wish.org/ and Make-A-Wish Foundation International http://www.worldwish.org/ websites to learn more about these organizations. 


The Future of WoW TCG - Part 2
Following Blizzard's announcement http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/future-of-wow-tcg-realms-lag-icc-progression/ a couple of days ago, Upper Deck International finally posted a few more details on how things will evolve for WoW TCG in the next couple of months. Apparently WoW TCG products will be available until the end of March, Spectral Tigers will become very hard to find after that I guess. 
Over the past few months there has been much speculation about the future of the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game and Miniatures Game and due to ongoing discussions, we haven’t been able to provide any clear answers until now.

After long and careful deliberation, Upper Deck International UDI will not be renewing its World of Warcraft license agreements with Blizzard Entertainment. We’ve had a fantastic time working on the World of Warcraft brand and feel we have produced some of the most compelling TCG and Miniatures Game products since the turn of the century. Unfortunately, due to gradually declining sales over the past few years and the overall downturn in the economic climate, we have had to make the tough decision to discontinue our World of Warcraft product lines.

UDI World of Warcraft products will be available until the end of March. Upcoming products such as the Class Starter Deck, Wrathgate Booster, Souls of Vengeance Starter, Deluxe Starter and Booster will not go into production.

We know this is disappointing news for all World of Warcraft fans and want to thank players and retailers for their ongoing support over the years.
Being part of such a great and passionate community has truly been a privilege.

We are currently working with Blizzard Entertainment to facilitate a smooth transition as they work on their own plans for a World of Warcraft Trading Card Game.
Further announcements on this transition will follow over the coming weeks.

We will be pulling out all the stops to send off the UDI World of Warcraft lines in style. Look out for special events at your local gaming store with some of the greatest prize support ever and a final opportunity to complete your collection.

Are we done with game balance changes until Cataclysm?
We're not done until Cataclysm actually ships. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23269036809-are-we-done-with-balance-changes-until-cata.html

Housing
While this originally came up before I was around, I think this has been answered at some BlizzCons since then. While we think this could be a fun idea, we also like the idea of seeing a lot of people in cities and don't want to make main cities feel like ghost towns - if you need an example of this head to Silvermoon yeah, that's a cheap shot, I know. So for now this idea remains an interesting idea but we'd have to make sure it fits into the game well and meets our expectations which are pretty high for something like this. 

[...] It's generally a better idea to keep the world filled and alive than empty, yes. It's also hard to say that letting people run off to their own cabin to relax in peace will really be a big bonus to the game for the vast majority of the playerbase. We'll see how things go in the future though. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23279927930-player-owned-houses--dev-status.html

The Phylactery of the Nameless Lich's proc is a little underbudget and we plan to correct that in an upcoming patch. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23269216964-phylactery-underbudget.html

Glyph of Disease bug - Icy Talons not active after a disease refresh
The intent is that the Glyph of Disease counts as Frost Fever for the purposes of activating Icy Talons. The issue you describe is a technical limitation which prevents it from working this way. It's something we definitely want to fix, though I don't have a time frame to provide at the moment for when this fix will occur.

Glyph of Wrath Suggestions
Glyph OF Wrath: Increases the cast time of Wrath by 0.5 and increases damage by X% 
I understand the intent and it's clever in a way, but we would be hesitant to introduce a glyph that would actually be a bad glyph for players who weren't capable of benefiting from a bunch of haste. There are some glyphs with a kiss / curse vibe, but usually not this severe, and with a curse that really isn't a curse when you consider that it lets you benefit more from haste in the long run.

It might make more sense if you tucked it away where only endgame focused players could reach it like an idol that dropped off an ICC boss, but even then it would almost need a warning label explaining what it was trying to do.

Destruction Spec
We know that Destruction is a little low on damage at the moment and needs a bit of help which we hope to deliver before Cataclysm. As usual we can't make any guarantees on when or if this will happen for sure though. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23269136780-any-word-on-destruction-adjustments.html
