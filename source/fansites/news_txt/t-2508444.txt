We expect these free character moves to remain open until 11:00 a.m. PDT 2:00 a.m. EDT on Monday, September 16. Please note that restrictions apply:


A character cannot move if the character:

is a guild leader.
has active auction listings or bids.
has mail.

You may be required to change your character’s name once you’ve reached the destination realm.
You cannot move a character to a PvP realm where you already have a character belonging to the opposing faction.
This is a one-way, irreversible move. Blizzard Customer Support cannot monitor or modify a free character move.


During periods of high usage, free character moves may take up to several hours to complete. This service may be closed at any time, without warning, should a destination realm become full. We strongly encourage players who wish to use this service, especially in coordinated groups, to do so as soon as possible.

Thank you!
