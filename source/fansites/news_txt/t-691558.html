<br>
Invincible Rising<br>
The mare Brightmane gave birth to Invincible as a young Prince Arthas watched with rapt attention.<br>
<br>
In the years following Invincible&apos;s birth, the horse and Arthas formed a bond that carried them across the warring nations of Azeroth, through the icy grip of death, and into the throes of battle.<br>
<br>
The stallion&apos;s coiled muscles were made for speed, and Arthas often felt that his mount flew rather than galloped across the countryside. With the slightest touch of his heel, Arthas was able to convey his directions, and Invincible obeyed without question or hesitation.<br>
<br>
It was Invincible&apos;s unfaltering faith in his master that inevitably led to the stallion&apos;s death and unholy rebirth. On a cold winter afternoon as snow was blanketing the ground, Arthas was desperate to get away from the city even if it meant riding through harsh and unforgiving weather. Once outside, Arthas guided Invincible over a familiar jump, but the stallion slipped on slick ice, and the fall shattered his forelegs. With no way to save his companion, Arthas was forced to give Invincible a merciful death, and the prince carried that guilt with him for a very long time.<br>
<br>
Years later, after the Lich King granted Arthas necromantic powers, Arthas returned to the grave where he had buried Invincible and raised his loyal servant into undeath. It was in this dark act that Arthas felt a sense of purpose. He believed that Invincible&apos;s death was not an accident; rather, it was essential to Arthas&apos;s destiny. <br>
<br>
Invincible was not bred to be a warhorse, but after he was brought back from the dead and made immune to hunger, pain, and exhaustion, he became the perfect steed for Arthas. Now the skeletal charger stalks Icecrown Citadel, ever at the ready to serve his beloved master.<br>
<br>
Arthas and Invincible were as one until parted by the stallion&apos;s untimely death. Now, they are rejoined in death through the power of the Lich King and pose a fearsome sight for all who gaze upon them. Only the power of the heroes of Azeroth can part them once more.<br>
<br>
In order to attain such a steed, one must conquer Icecrown Citadel and face the Lich King on Heroic difficulty. Perhaps you will be the lucky individual to obtain the most coveted of mounts -- the Invincible Charger. This reward awaits those who are brave enough to tempt fate and face the full wrath of the Lich King! <br>
