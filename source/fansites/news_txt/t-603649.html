I don&apos;t know why these changes went unnoticed to be honest. Some of the Zul&apos;aman items models have been changed (probably in the original 2.3.2 patch 2 weeks ago) and Spinesever has been nerfed (Latest PTR Build I think).<br>
<br>
2.3.2 - Earth shield changes reverted.<br>
Just temporarily until they find out how to address the dispel issue.<br>
In the current version of patch 2.3.2 we added a 30 second cooldown to earth shield and lowered the mana cost by approximately 50%. We have decided to temporarily revert both of these changes until we address the dispel issue, which will likely be for patch 2.4.<br>
<br>
In short, earth shield will not be changed in patch 2.3.2.<br>

2.3.2 PTR - Model changes<br>
If you copied your 2.3 character on the PTR, you might have noticed them already since they&apos;re one or two weeks old, but I&apos;ll post it for the 99% of readers who never connect on PTRs. Sorry for the late news again.<br>

If you have one charge of flurry remaining and crit with that attack, flurry does not proc/refresh<br>

Both bugs will be fixed in a patch after 2.3.2<br>

There isn&apos;t any beta or announced release date yet. Shops announcing early release on their pre-order only do it because they&apos;re required to have one if they presell an item.
