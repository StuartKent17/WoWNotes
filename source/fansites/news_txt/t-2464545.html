Developer Interview - Ion Hazzikostas<br>
Ion Hazzikostas recently sat down with Vanion to talk about the state of the game and more!<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
State of the Game<br>
<br>
The team cares deeply about the state of the game. They are visiting all of the different venues where players provide feedback and talk about the game and read all of the comments.<br>
People love the game and have a deep connection, but it&apos;s going in a direction they don&apos;t like, and that&apos;s frustrating. Feedback comes from a place of emotion. <br>
One of the challenges with WoW is that there are very diverse audiences and play styles. When players accuse the team of being out of touch, it isn&apos;t that they don&apos;t understand players concerns, or what they&apos;d like the game to be. The team has to keep in mind the other half dozen groups of players that want the game to be different things, often opposing things. <br>
Players have every right to focus on their own experience.<br>
The team wants everyone to be as happy as possible. <br>
The internet is a place that has become a bit more polarized, and it&apos;s become more about getting anger out there and less about finding common ground.<br>
There is a bright future ahead, with the majority of Battle for Azeroth&apos;s patch content still to come. If you think back to this time in Legion, there was much more to follow.<br>
The team is focused on learning from mistakes that were made with systems and rewards at the start of Battle for Azeroth, correcting many of those in Patch 8.1.<br>
<br>
<br>
Progression and Catch-Up Mechanics<br>
<br>
It&apos;s important that progression and gear matter, but the team wants the game to remain accessible to people who are joining later or coming back. It&apos;s not just in the interest of those players, but everyone in a guild. <br>
Throughout Burning Crusade, guilds complained bitterly about having to go back and get people attuned and do content that was irrelevant to them. These hurdles made it harder to recruit and get into raiding. <br>
Patch 8.1 introduced catch-up mechanisms that were intended to get players ready for Battle of Dazar&apos;alor. This initially felt like the game was giving you too much compared the current raid (Uldir). <br>
The team can probably do more towards having more guaranteed progression through currencies for Raid and Dungeon content. Conquest provides this gear track on the PvP side.<br>
<br>
<br>
Azerite Armor<br>
<br>
A lot of Patch 8.1 reflects lessons learned from the launch of Battle for Azeroth.<br>
There are still some fundamental flaws with the Azerite Armor system that the team is looking to pivot away from with Rise of Azshara. <br>
The team is happy with the system in terms of the customization it allows, but the progression of unlocking those traits was a mismatch with that customization system. <br>
Going forward, the team wants to keep armor fully unlocked and have a different avenue of progression in the Heart of Azeroth itself. <br>
<br>
<br>
Classes<br>
<br>
Legion focused on class identity as it was an important part of the story. <br>
The team tried to move away from mixing utility and throughput, as putting utility as an option against something that lets you do more damage isn&apos;t an interesting choice. <br>
The team has pulled away from talents that gave classes utility in an area that was traditionally weak for them. Someone has to be very mobile, someone has to be less mobile. <br>
Classes don&apos;t have too many abilities anymore, that isn&apos;t a problem they are trying to solve. The team is open to moving some talents back to baseline abilities where it makes sense. <br>
<br>
<br>
Patch 8.2<br>
<br>
In the next tier, the raid will probably open within a couple weeks of the patch. This time the raid opened later due to the holidays. <br>
The Crucible of Storms serves as a bridge between Battle of of Dazar&apos;alor and Rise of Azshara. It may not open with the release of Patch 8.1.5, but probably not too long after that. <br>
The team is going to look at where the playerbase as a whole is at to set the item level for Crucible of Storms. It&apos;s only a 2 boss raid, so it may be slightly higher item level gear than Battle of of Dazar&apos;alor. <br>
Mechagon is a second, smaller zone than Nazjatar, which is the main zone in Rise of Azshara. There is a megadungeon that is similar to Karazhan. Patch 8.2 will go on the PTR shortly after Patch 8.1.5 is live. <br>
The goal of Nazjatar is to learn from all of the past outdoor zones and improve upon them. <br>
<br>
<br>
Rares and Treasures<br>
<br>
The team would like to move back to a treasure system like Warlords that had a better story and rewards. <br>
There haven&apos;t been true Rare mobs since Mists. In a world where you can join cross-server groups, the right way to hunt for true rare spawns was server hopping. People would realm hop in Tanaan Jungle to find rares rather than moving around to find what&apos;s up. The team will be experimenting with rares in Rise of Azshara and beyond. There was something cool about finding a rare and being excited about it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mage Tower<br>
<br>
The team was happy with how the Mage Tower worked out and would love to do it again in the future. They don&apos;t want to make it part of the expansion formula, it needs to fit the story and world.<br>
<br>
<br>
Warfronts<br>
<br>
Warfronts on live currently are Raid Finder difficulty. Heroic Warfronts will be closer to a Normal experience, tuned for a group that is coordinating together. It won&apos;t be a challenge for a Mythic raid group.<br>
No new Warfront is planned for Rise of Azshara. <br>
The Barrens Warfront was an early prototype and isn&apos;t currently planned. <br>
<br>
<br>
Professions<br>
<br>
The team is looking to improve crafting professions. <br>
The most successful crafting professions in WoW have been ones that create consumable things to sell, such as Alchemy or Enchanting. <br>
Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, and Tailoring have been the more challenging ones, as the gear they create competes with every other source of gear in the game. <br>
If you can get crafted gear that is better than raid gear, you don&apos;t really need to raid. If crafted gear is weaker than raid gear, then it is useless. <br>
Historically BoP items from dungeons and raids have been used. <br>
There is lots of room for improvement, including allowing you to specialize in certain Blacksmithing areas so that you are different or better than other Blacksmiths. <br>
<br>
<br>
Zone Updates<br>
<br>
Redoing older zones is a huge undertaking, but the team is always looking for a reason to do so, such as creating new content in those zones. It&apos;s unlikely that the team will update older zones over creating new ones, as it wouldn&apos;t be in the best interest of players. <br>
