As we announced during our WoW Esports live stream, Season 2 of the Mythic Dungeon Invitational is almost here! It&#x2019;s time for the best dungeon teams from around the globe to show us what you&#x2019;ve got. To kick things off, we wanted to share some additional details on this season&#x2019;s Proving Grounds.<br>
<br>
Everything You Need to Know About Proving Grounds<br>
<br>
Feb 27 - Proving Ground Week 1 &#x2013; Raging, Volcanic, Tyrannical<br>
Mar 6 - Proving Ground Week 2 &#x2013; Teeming, Explosive, Fortified<br>
<br>
Like last season, we&#x2019;re kicking things off with a period we call Proving Grounds, when teams come together to prove they&#x2019;ve got what it takes. This year&#x2019;s Proving Grounds will be similar to last year&#x2019;s, with a few slight changes. <br>
<br>
The Proving Grounds period kicks off for the Americas region on February 27 at 10h00 CET. Week 2 begins March 6 at the same time, and the Proving Grounds ends March 13 at 7 a.m. PST (10 a.m. EST). Teams on Oceanic realms will also use this time frame for submitting scores from the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. This will ensure that their runs line up with the appropriate Mythic Keystone affix rotation cycles.<br>
<br>
During the two-week Proving Grounds period, you&#x2019;ll form a group of five friends and tackle the highest difficulty Mythic Keystone dungeons you can handle. Your goal is to complete a total of five level 23 Mythic Keystone dungeons over those two weeks. Keep in mind the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
Your group must have the same five player characters for all five runs; you can&#x2019;t swap in another character.<br>
Duplicate dungeons won&#x2019;t count toward your runs, so make sure you tackle a variety.<br>
Runs must be completed within the Keystone timer to count (the timer varies by dungeon).<br>
<br>
<br>
Once your group has completed the dungeons on the required difficulty, you&#x2019;ll need to choose a team captain to register your team. Check back on this post when the Proving Ground period ends to learn more about where and how to submit your best time.<br>
<br>
If your team clears the dungeons, submits their times by the deadline, and meets the requirements (regional eligibility, accounts in good standing), you&#x2019;ll receive an invitation to the Mythic Dungeon Invitational tournament realm for the next stage of the tournament: the Time Trials.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll post the official rules for the tournament soon, but in the meantime, make sure that you and your team members meet our regional eligibility requirements:<br>
