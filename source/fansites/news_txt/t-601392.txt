Boubouille2007-06-17, 10:04 AMUpdate : Almost forgot to mention it, BT/Hyjal Loots  updated, thanks to Vysogota. Will try to change the list during the week too, the current version is way too hard to read

I know you love them, here is another addon highlight. Today I'll talk about skinner, which is the mod I used on this screenshot  for example. 
Basically, skinner changes the layout of all your windows, character frame, inventory, etc, to something ... different and in my opinion, better. 

Clicking the picture will redirect you to wowace.com download page, just browse through the list. But to be honest you should use WowAceUpdater , if you never used it before it's gonna change your life. 


 

Website
Won't post too many important things today, there is a lot of work going on the site and I'll probably be able to release a few things soon, tonight or tomorrow if there isn't too much slacking. 

Don't worry, I know that a lot of things are lacking updates, and it will be fixed very soon. ^^
