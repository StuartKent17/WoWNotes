Boubouille2007-04-10, 09:01 PMEyonix made a short post confirming that new encounters will be tuned to reflect the elixir changes in 2.1.0. See the previous news


New raid encounters will be tuned with the new elixir limitation in mind. If problems are identified for existing raid encounters, as a result of this change, we will make the appropriate tuning adjustments.

Edit : Shade of Aran has been hotfixed, I don't really know why it's a hotfix since it was already mentionned in the 2.0.10 patch notes http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/, but I guess it's now real. 

Beneficial immunity effects from abilities such as Ice Block and Divine Shield will no longer cause the Shade of Aran's explosion effect from Flame Wreath to proc when the duration has faded.
