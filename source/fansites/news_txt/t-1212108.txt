chaud2012-10-16, 05:38 PMUpcoming Heroic Elegon Hotfixes
​This week will see some changes coming to the Elegon encounter in Heroic mode Mogu’shan Vaults. The Discharge http://www.wowdb.com/spells/118299 effect that occurs whenever an Energy Charge http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/60913 is defeated was not dealing damage in Heroic mode, which had the effect of making a portion of the fight easier than it should be. Since a few guilds had already beaten Heroic mode Elegon before we were able to apply a hotfix to the issue, we chose to hold off on resolving this issue until now to keep the field even during the first week of Heroic progression. In addition to the fix to Discharge, Elegon’s health will also be reduced to offset the loss of Draw Power http://www.wowdb.com/spells/124967 stacks resulting from the Discharge resolution. 

The following fixes will be in place when raids reset this week in each region:
Discharge http://www.wowdb.com/spells/118299 now properly deals damage in Heroic difficulty. Elegon’s health has been reduced by approximately 12.5% on Heroic difficulty.​
