MMO-Champion Guide Contest - Win a Mottled Drake and a Riding Turtle!<br>
After the ridiculously popular Facebook giveaways during the week-end, I came to the conclusion that my users like free stuff and I decided to kick it up a notch with a contest.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2010/december/prize.jpg<br>
<br>
Prizes<br>
All the TCG related prizes, including the mounts, are courtesy of WoWTCGLoot.com (http://www.wowtcgloot.com/) who was nice enough to send tons of awesome stuff my way. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1st Place - Mottled Drake (http://www.wowtcgloot.com/mottled_drake.htm) Flying Mount. It&apos;s brand new and still rare enough to make you the only player flying one on your server.<br>
2nd Place - Riding Turtle (http://www.wowtcgloot.com/riding_turtle.htm) Ground Mount. The cutest ground mount ever can be yours! <br>
3rd Place - Ethereal Portal (http://www.wowtcgloot.com/ethereal_portal.htm) An item replacing your Heartstone by an awesome Ethereal portal! <br>
4th Place - Companion Pet Pack #1 - World of Warcraft Pet: Lil Ragnaros (http://eu.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=221004437) + World of Warcraft&#xAE; Pet: Moonkin Hatchling (http://eu.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=221004438)<br>
5th Place - Companion Pet Pack #2 - World of Warcraft&#xAE; Pet: Pandaren Monk (http://eu.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=221003558) + World of Warcraft&#xAE; Pet: Lil&#x2019; XT (http://eu.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=221003878)<br>
<br>
<br>
Your guide<br>
<br>
The only thing you have to do is to write the best guide you can! It can be anything, raid guide, auction house guide, profession guide, class guides, addons configuration guide, guide on how to make your level 1 alt look awesome, guide on how to tweak and optimize WoW, etc ... The possibilities are endless.<br>
Picking something original is nice, but keep in mind that the main purpose of a guide is to be helpful. Also keep in mind that it has to be related to WoW!!! <br>
I think any kind of content is allowed as long as it can go on the main page. Pictures will make anything better and I strongly suggest that you use them (and don&apos;t rush them on paint) but you can totally expand to videos or HTML/Javascript (keep it simple, please)<br>
If you plan to use HTML/Javascript you will have to host that part of your guide on your own site, I won&apos;t let you embed it on the forums for very obvious security reasons. <br>
If you need to upload images, use imgur.com (http://imgur.com/), they&apos;re nice. <br>
<br>
<br>
Contest Rules<br>
<br>
The contest starts as soon as this news post goes up and will end on Tuesday 28th December at 08:00PM GMT. <br>
Your guide has to be posted in the Guide Submission Forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/321-Guide-Submission). One entry per person.<br>
New content only - I have absolutely no way to check if you&apos;re the original author of a guide if you already posted it somewhere else. People caught cheating by stealing other people&apos;s work on other sites will be permanently banned from the forums. <br>
You are free to edit the content of your guide until the end of the contest, on Tuesday 28th December at 08:00PM GMT the forums will be locked and all the guides there will be reviewed. <br>
Other forum users can not see your guide and will not steal your ideas. To prevent any drama the guides are also hidden for moderators and global moderators and the only people who can see them are the Administrators (who aren&apos;t allowed to participate, obviously).<br>
The winners are the people who come up with the best guide. They will be announced shortly after the end of the contest and the winning guides will be published on the front page over the next few days. <br>
After all the winners have been announced and their guides published on the front page, the guides submission forum will become public and users will be free to check any of the guide submitted during the contest.<br>
<br>
<br>
Good luck! <br>
