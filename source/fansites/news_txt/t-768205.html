World of Warcraft(R): Cataclysm(TM) in Stores Starting December 7<br>
<br>
IRVINE, Calif., Oct 04, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE) &#x2014; Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. today announced that World of Warcraft(R): Cataclysm(TM), the highly anticipated third expansion for the world&apos;s most popular subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game*, will be released starting on December 7, 2010. The expansion will be available on DVD-ROM for Windows(R) XP/Windows Vista(R)/Windows(R) 7 and Macintosh(R) at a suggested retail price of $39.99 and will also be offered as a digital download from the Blizzard Store. A special Collector&apos;s Edition packed with bonus items will be available exclusively in retail stores for a suggested retail price of $79.99.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cataclysm includes the best content we&apos;ve ever created for World of Warcraft. It&apos;s not just an expansion, but a re-creation of much of the original Azeroth, complete with epic new high-level adventures for current players and a redesigned leveling experience for those just starting out,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;With the help of our beta testers, we&apos;re putting on the final polish, and we look forward to welcoming gamers around the world to enjoy it in just a couple of months.&quot;<br>
<br>
The first two World of Warcraft expansions, The Burning Crusade(R) and Wrath of the Lich King(R), each shattered PC game sales records upon their release.* In Cataclysm, the face of Azeroth will be forever altered by the return of the corrupted Dragon Aspect Deathwing. Players will explore once-familiar areas of the world that have now been reshaped by the devastation and filled with new adventures. In an effort to survive the planet-shattering cataclysm, two new playable races &#x2014; worgen and goblins &#x2014; will join the struggle between the Alliance and the Horde. As players journey to the new level cap of 85, they&apos;ll discover newly revealed locations, acquire new levels of power, and come face to face with Deathwing in a battle to determine the fate of the world.<br>
