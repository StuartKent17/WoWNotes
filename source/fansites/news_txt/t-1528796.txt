Warlords of Draenor - Tier 17 Shaman Armor Set
Today we are taking a look at the Tier 17 Shaman armor set. No Mythic set has been added for Shamans yet. 

Warlords of Draenor changes things up slightly by using one set of art for Raid Finder, one set of art for Normal and Heroic, and one set of art for Mythic difficulty. You can find the Raid Finder armor sets in our Raid Finder armor sets preview

Blackrock Foundry

Oregorger, The Devourer
Oregorger is an overgrown Goren who has burrowed his way into the Blackrock Foundry's storage room and gluttonously consumed their Blackrock ore.


Overview - Oregorger is fought in a Blackrock storage room.His abilities spend his Blackrock Ore resource to cast. When he has spent all of his Blackrock Ore he begins rolling through the storage room consuming any Blackrock Ore he sees. Once Oregorger is full of Blackrock Ore, he stops rolling and returns to fighting.

<img src="" title="Dps" /> Damage Dealers - Interrupt Blackrock Barrage to prevent raidwide damage and slow Oregorger's consumption of Blackrock Ore.
Breaking open Ore Crates during Feeding Frenzy will leave Blackrock Ore on the ground for Oregorger to consume.
<img src="" title="Healer" /> Healers - Shielding and using damage mitigating abilities on the closest target of Acid Torrent can decrease the damage dealt to rest of the targets.
<img src="" title="Tank" /> Tank - Position yourself to be closest in the Acid Torrent cone and use damage mitigating abilities to decrease the damage dealt to others.

The Iron Maidens
With little opportunity to exercise her tactical brilliance under the ancient social structure of the orc clans, Gar'an was thrilled to be one of the first warriors to volunteer for naval duty under the Iron Horde. Instantly successful in battle, she was named Admiral of the Iron Horde fleet and selected Marak and Sorka as her lieutenants. Together, they are called The Iron Maidens - and have crushed any who have dared face them in battle.


Overview - The Iron Maidens periodically gain Iron Fury. As the Maidens gain Iron Fury, they gain new abilities. Periodically, one of the Maidens will use a zipline to man the Dreadnaught's main cannon, from which she will bombard players. A team of players must use loading chains to get to the deck of the boat, defeat the Deckhand stationed there, and sabotage the ammunition of the main cannon before it finishes Warming Up. Whenever one of the Maidens reaches 20% health, they will all activate Iron Will. Players must then quickly defeat them before being overwhelmed.

<img src="" title="Dps" /> Damage Dealers - Blade Dash can be deadly - avoid standing close to other players if you are battling Sorka.
Intercept Garan's Penetrating Shot to save the targeted player.
<img src="" title="Healer" /> Healers - Players who fail to avoid the Detonation Sequence from bombs fired by the Dreadnaught's main cannon will take heavy damage.
While Sanguine Strikes, is active, the raid while take heavy Shadow damage.
Ensure players targeted by Dark Hunt are not low on health when it expires.
<img src="" title="Tank" /> Tanks - Move between Marak and the target of her Blood Ritual to intercept the effect of Crystalized Blood.
Minimize damage taken by Marak's melee strikes while Sanguine Strikes is active.
Pursue Sorka or Marak when they board the Dreadnaught to bombard the docks.

Auchindoun

Azzakel, Vanguard of the Legion
On Argus - the former homeworld of the Draenei, now the stronghold of the Burning Legion - Azzakel waits, poised for a servant of the Legion to open a portal to one of the countless worlds they seek to invade. As Soulbinder Nyami lowers the defenses of Auchindoun, Azzakel senses that his services will soon be employed towards the destruction of the holiest of Draenei temples.


Overview - Azzakel alternates between engaging players directly in combat and summoning reinforcements from the demon world Argus. While summoning reinforcements, Azzakel cannot be attacked and players should focus on quickly defeating the reinforcements that emerge from the portal, so that they are not overwhelmed as more demons invade.

<img src="" title="Dps" /> Damage Dealers - While Azzakel channels Claws of Argus, focus on killing the demons that emerge from his portal.

Any chance you can tell me the character base move speed in ft/sec and the base shot speed in ft/sec?
Base player move speed is 7yd/sec.Aimed Shot travels at 40yd/sec.What's your concern? Celestalon 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
how many times are we going to be refreshing sunfire in solar? aiming for max power or duration?
For boss DPS, probably two Sunfires per Solar; that gives you 100% Sunfire uptime. Celestalon 

Why not make Wrath/Starfire share a button similar to moonfire/sunfire now that stopping the eclipse bar isn't a thing?
Confusing to have a button swap mid-cast. Just makes the rotation easier. There's skill to picking the best one, timing-wise. Celestalon 
Can the Starsurge buff be split between Wrath/Starfire? Does it set which buff based on bar position or first cast?
You get one of the two Empowerment buffs based on where your bar is when you cast Starsurge. Celestalon 

with astral storm being removed, is hurricanes' spell damage type being changed in any way?
No, still Nature. Though planning a glyph to swap Hurricane to Astral Storm and Starfall to Sunfall. Celestalon 
they'll switch between eclipses with that glyph or no?
No, just always. Celestalon 
ok, with the change to starsurge, is it just a instant cast buff that doesn't do the spellstorm damage anymore?
No, it still does the spellstorm damage, and has a 1.5sec cast time. It's still Starsurge. Celestalon 
So Starsurge being instant is ruled out?
No, not ruled out. Just trying with a 1.5sec cast time first. Celestalon 

Could you please briefly describe how Crit/Haste/Readiness will affect the new Balance talents i.e will haste affect cycle time?
None of those affect the cycle time. Celestalon 

Noticed on some notes that Ravage is being removed. Will feral dps get some new Sunday punch or what excatly?
Ravage was merged with Shred. Celestalon 

Quick Q regarding Ursa Major - can both MS from a single event proc it?
Yes. Celestalon 
How does it work?Always 2% ? Or stackable % ?
Its benefit rolls. Whatever % is left based on time from the previous buff is added to the next one. Celestalon 
Example: You've got a 24% buff up, with 25sec left, and refresh it. 24%*25sec/30sec = 20%. Plus new 2%, result = +22%. Celestalon 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Where within Black Arrow does the guaranteed lock and load take place?
Somewhere; no guaranteed spot, just somewhere. Celestalon 
One assumption is that if it hasn't triggered by the last tick, it must on the last tick.
Yes, that'd be fair, through process of elimination. Celestalon 
Oh, that's not how it works, though. It's not like the last tick ends up having a higher proc frequency. Celestalon 
Any info on how it does work?
It determines at cast time how many procs there'll be, then randomly distributes those procs throughout the ticks. Celestalon 
Proc count starts at 1, then it has successive 20% chances to add 1, until it fails a roll. Celestalon 
That's kind of neat.Proc count=2, 10 ticks, rng generator rolls 2 times, predetermining ticks 3 and 7 to proc...?
Yep. But you don't need to know any of that in order to play optimally; that's just the nitty gritty. Celestalon 
Prob. Pushing my luck, but IF black arrow works with readiness, would that lead to oddities with <20 second cd?
Perhaps. It's something we know we'll need to solve if we do put Black Arrow on Readiness. Celestalon 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Avert Harm is taken away, Black Ox: Guard, and the Dizzying Haze "misfire" as well. So where is brewmaster utility? TBR?
Misfire was basically non-existent; didn't work on bosses. Brewmasters are extremely mobile, good at controlling damage, Celestalon 
and good at picking up new adds. Celestalon 

Regarding the #WoD changes to Black Ox Statue's "Guard", what do Brewmasters now have to provide any type of wall for our raid? 
If you're talking an Absorb effect, nothing. They do still have healing. Chi Burst, Chi Torpedo undertuned on live, I know. Celestalon 
Thank you for responding. But I mean, aside from "kite tanking", what mashes Brewmaster diserable vs any other tank now?
They're still very good tanks. Ox Guard was minor. Other tanks lost things similarly. Celestalon 
I don't argue that, all of the tanks are good tanks, Blizz has done a great job. But, I now bring no raid utility, just AOE slow
We're bringing down the raid utility of *all* tanks, not just Brewmasters. Celestalon 
that's fair. I just felt that AoE damage reduction CDs, felt really nice in the hands of the tank role. Being the raid's shield.
Feeling-wise, I totally understand and agree. Gameplay-wise, we need to reduce the number of such CDs, and tanks are one... Celestalon 
...place we can remove a bunch, without endangering anyone's raid slot. Celestalon 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
So prot pallies will no longer have a passive self heal? Or is that being rolled into something else?
Inner Light is being merged back into Seal of Insight. Celestalon 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Does Devouring Plague's DoT still scale with Shadow Orbs used in WoD? Tooltip change is kind of unclear.
In effect, yes, since the DoT is now a % of the direct damage. Celestalon 
Just to double check: The "additional 100% damage over 6 sec" means 100% of the direct damage dealt, not 100% of SP over 6 sec?
Correct. Celestalon 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Resolve is complication w/o depth. % based heals feel much better, ie Enraged Regen. Choices will not change with diff Resolve
That's actually the point; we don't want it to. We want Shield Barrior and Shield Block to *both* be useful, whether... Celestalon 
...you're fighting a solo quest mob, or a raid boss. Celestalon 

Hiya, isn't weaving execute into normal war rotation a bit expensive in terms of cost? Can wars pool that much rage in seconds?
Sometimes, yes. Celestalon 

Character / Items
is T16 Gear going to be better than Heroic Dungeon gear next expansion? be pretty stupid if this is true.
What makes you think that would be the case? Max-level dungeon gear has always replaced the last expansion's gear. WatcherDev 

WHY IS THE CM RANGED WEAPON A GUN
One of our character artists is working on a bow literally as I type. Source 

Heirlooms. Will they swap between str/agi & int? Time to remove the 80/85 dif? What happens if you have 2x of a kind?
No plans to offer switching stats.Other stuff is too complicated for 140 characters. Source 

Will banners like de [Sen'jin Banner] be included as toys?
de banners probably be makin' dere way into de Toy Box, ya. Source

Please make the Hordebreaker title account-wide.
Seems like an oversight that it's not. I'll fix that for 6.0. WatcherDev

Is this something considered for non-PvP realms too?
PvE realms tend to have a far better ratio. We will see though. holinka

Speaking of raid races - any chance we'll see another at ?
Our live raids have been some of the most popular events at past Blizzcons. WatcherDev 


OpenRaid Event - Item Level 471 Siege of Orgrimmar Clear
With Siege of Orgrimmar stretching on for some time now, some groups are trying to make it more interesting.

FinalBoss - Blizzcon 2013 Live Raid
In the Blue Tweets above, Watcher mentioned that the Blizzcon Live Raid is one of the most popular events at Blizzcon when someone asked about having one this year. If you didn't watch it last year, FinalBoss has released  a nice cut down version of the live raid that is faster to watch.
