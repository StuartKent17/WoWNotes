<br>
The Armory Tools (http://armory.mmo-champion.com/ (http://armory.mmo-champion.com/)) were based on an open source script from Antiarc, who first published it on http://wow.tachyonsix.com/armory/ (http://wow.tachyonsix.com/armory/). <br>
<br>
Sadly, I didn&apos;t have the time (and the knowledge) to update it, and I had a few bugs on the site that I couldn&apos;t really fix. I thought it might be a good idea to ask Antiarc if he would like to be hosted on mmo-champion.com. <br>
<br>
The main Armory Tools (http://armory.mmo-champion.com/) site is now hosted on the site and run independently by Antiarc. It should be more up to date than what I had on the site earlier. (And before someone ask in comments, yes the gold sellers ads are removed and you can report them, posting in comments is fine)</div></div>
