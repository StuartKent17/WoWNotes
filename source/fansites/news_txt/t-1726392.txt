Patch 6.1 - Challenge Mode Leaderboards
One of the undocumented changes http://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_6.1.0_%28undocumented_changes%29 in Patch 6.1 was the removal of some shortcuts in dungeons http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1724709-Dungeon-Landscape-changes-WITH-ZERO-WARNING. This means that it would be very difficult to beat the current best times, as they likely utilized these shortcuts.

Garrison Visitor - Profession Traders
We've gone over the feedback regarding visiting profession traders. There's now a hotfix being worked on to remove the random element and have profession traders rotate out daily. The hotfix isn't ready yet, but it will be implemented as soon as possible. In short, no more fur traders visiting for multiple days in a row. 

The hotfix has been implemented on the live realms. Visiting profession traders should now be on a daily rotation. *Crosses talons the fur trader isn't first in the rotation.* Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/363630-were-already-getting-repeat-vendors/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16412002068?page=15#297

Flight Path Logic
One specific flight path that I notice from doing the jukebox quest is trying to fly from the piece you get at Pinchwhistle to Everbloom to get the piece there. The flight path connects through a series of points that goes in a western arc through the middle of Talador then up through Gorgrond when it could easily have gone through a straighter path north.
This one surprised me, and you don't have to point all the way to Everbloom. In recreating what you did, I went to Pinchwhistle and hovered over Beastwatch, and saw the issue.

Thank you for the good example. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/363498-flight-paths-still-illogical/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16410891906?page=3#57

Character / Items
Will heirlooms change primary stats similar to how gear in Draenor changes stats with the new system in 6.1
To add: it is something we’re keeping an eye on for the future as we see how players interact with the Heirloom system. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/567843368966889473

are Don Carlos's Famous Hat and the River Boat good candidates for the toy box?
Not at this time, but thank you for the suggestions. What other things would you like to see as toys? WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/567843517487149056

- might've missed my last one - any chance of Illusion: Soulfrost and Illusion: Sunfire making it to the game ? Maybe in 6.1 ?
Not in 6.1. We’re excited by the potential of the Illusion system & always happy to hear which ones players might enjoy, though! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/567844245307936768

Reputation / Questing
Frostwolf Orcs and Council of Exarchs rep achievs are per-character, but show up on opposite faction, is this fixed in 6.1?
Not in 6.1, but we're aiming to have this fixed in 6.2. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/567840337906913281

World
Can you fix the female troll with a female orc voice in the dmf plz...She is the first troll juggler when you enter.
This is fixed in 6.1. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/567757193828671488

Garrisons
are the followers recruited via the Inn finite? eg will always picking Magic Debuff eventually exhaust that pool of followers?
Finite, but there are a whole lot of them. It would take you over a year of recruiting to get all of the Magic Debuff followers. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/567755135640559618

Why is my level 94 DK not getting Highmaul follower missions even though it has enough 645 ilevel followers?
Cache missions will join the rotation once you hit level 100. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/567777970825207808
Why cache missions but not all the other gear ones, though?
Cache missions are based upon your progress in the various raid instances. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/567796140013314048
