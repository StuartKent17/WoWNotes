Upcoming PvP Hotfixes 8/1
The following hotfixes have been applied to beta, and will be added to the live game later this week. We continue to work on other adjustments, such as the damage and healing output of other specs including Discipline, Retribution, and Balance. Those changes are going to take a little longer than the following hotfixes, but we wanted to get these in your hands for testing while playing on beta.

We appreciate all the feedback that has been generated from testing out the combination of Azerite Traits, Talents, Enchants, and Gearing options found on Gladiator's Sanctum.

In these hotfixes, we've targeted specs that are currently over-performing in certain PvP situations. Instead of reducing the overall damage that specializations such as Assassination Rogues and Marksmanship Hunters deal in PvP, we've chosen to reduce some of the talents and abilities that can contribute to high damage burst windows.

Changes to specializations in Battle for Azeroth have increased the power of specific PvP Talents. Restoration Druids in particular gained a large increase to Lifebloom in Battle for Azeroth, so we have in turn reduced the overall power of Focused Growth.
