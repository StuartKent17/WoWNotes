Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Saw your recent discussion about developer communication. Was interesting. Sucks how awful people can be. Stay strong.
Players don't hurt my feelings. I am old and crusty. But other devs may be too scared or scarred to participate. OccupyGStreet 

Shame that people fire back and say "Well, the devs need thicker skin!".... -.-
Would be nice if they did, but they don't, so it comes down to: do you want to talk to them or not? OccupyGStreet 

But if there's a policy against talking to players, they clearly don't think it's worthwhile.
Developers might value it while the institution does not. OccupyGStreet 

I'm just not fond of every company lately treating every single little thing like they're the nuclear launch codes
You mean keeping things too close to the chest? I agree. OccupyGStreet 
If you promise and have to pivot, people are going to be disappointed. Just deal with it. Still better than never talking. OccupyGStreet 

What do you think has prompted WoW players to come to you seeking answers about Blizzard as of recent?
I have a big mouth and poor impulse control. OccupyGStreet
