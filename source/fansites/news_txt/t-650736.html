Depending on Blizzard&apos;s plans we might see Patch 3.1.3 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=58856.0) deployed on live servers this week and druids will get a 2nd preview of the Updated Druid Forms (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=59051.0). Stay tuned! <br>
<br>
Ulduar Loot List Update<br>
Better late than never, right? The Ulduar 25-Man Loot List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=862#loot25) and Ulduar 10-Man Loot List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=862#loot10) have been updated with all the latest loot discovered on live servers. There are probably a few bugs left but it should be much more reliable than before. <br>
