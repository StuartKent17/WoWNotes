If you waste spend a lot of time on this site, you probably already heard about the brew fest. It seems that it will includes a rather large structure (probably in capital towns ?) used to serve tons of beers. Screenshot follows !<br>
<br>
There is also a new 18 slots bag, probably introduced during the haloween (oh em gee ! Broom mount ! (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bDyp8H3_oo)) and will more than likely be equivalent to [item=20400]<br>
