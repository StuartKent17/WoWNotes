01:10AM PST - Class changes are (finally) here. <br>
11:30PM PST - Ysera (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/august/ysera.jpg) looks great.<br>
11:00PM PST - Added 6 screenshots of the game data streaming and added reforging. Classes changes are on the way. (Yes, &quot;a few hours&quot; doesn&apos;t mean the eternity) <br>
10:00PM PST - A lot of stuff is broken because well ... working with streamed data isn&apos;t fun. Classes changes will probably have to wait a few hours. Don&apos;t worry, there is a plan B to keep you interested. <br>
09:00PM PST - Downloading. New launcher looks pretty, but makes me sad. <br>
<br>
<br>
Cataclysm Beta - Build 12694<br>
A new build is being deployed on live servers. The coverage of the changes in this patch will take a while because .... well, we have to redownload the whole client with a downloader currently in beta. (Beta is the keyword here, really) <br>
<br>
<br>
Reforging<br>
Reforging is finally here! You can swap 40% of any of the secondary stats of an item (mostly ratings) for another secondary stat. <br>

<br>
When you have enough data to enter the game, the world will be downloaded as you progress through the game. Absolutely everything is streamed, the world, the maps, special parts of the interface, etc ... It&apos;s a little annoying when you start from scratch but it&apos;s fairly impressive. <br>

Cataclysm Build 12694 Official Notes<br>
I&apos;m pretty sure I never posted the official patch notes on the front page, they&apos;re not really interesting but at least you have something to read while you download the client.<br>
World of Warcraft: Cataclysm Beta Patch Notes (version 12694)<br>
<br>
Welcome to the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm beta test! Patch notes listed here are not comprehensive and will be changed throughout the testing process.<br>
<br>
General<br>
The Alliance starting experience for worgen is available. Venture through the cursed lands of Gilneas to discover your true path! Currently the female worgen character is not available for testing.<br>
The Horde starting experience for goblins is available. Beginning on the Isle of Kezan in a goblin paradise, players will face a treacherous road ahead!<br>
The level cap for all characters is 83.<br>
Elements of the guild leveling, perks, and roster page are now functional. Players should once again be able to buy and register guild charters, which now only require five signatures. See the Known Issues section for issues associated with this new system.<br>
Cataclysm Launcher Update<br>
<br>
The new Cataclysm Launcher allows you to stream game data while you play. This will reduce the time you spend downloading, installing, and patching World of Warcraft. We&#x2019;d like to get your feedback on the toolset and gameplay experience. Please head to the forums here for additional information: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=26262801168&amp;sid=2000<br>
<br>
Players may use our Character Copy feature for copying existing characters to beta realms, or may choose from high-level pre-made template characters.<br>
<br>
<br>
Zones<br>
Mount Hyjal and Vashj&apos;ir, two new level 80-82 zones, are available for testing. Deepholm, a new level 82-83 zone is available for testing. Players may find their way to these zones by speaking with temporary teleportation NPCs located in any major city.<br>
The level ranges of Gilneas and the Lost Isles are in the process of being adjusted slightly. Creature, quest, and quest reward levels are all being altered so that players finish questing in these zones roughly by level 12. Further fine tuning will continue in future content updates.<br>
Several zones have had quest maps integrated.<br>
Eastern Kingdoms<br>
<br>
Arathi Highlands, Blasted Lands, The Cape of Stranglethorn, Dun Morogh, Duskwood, Eastern Plaguelands, Elwynn Forest, Hinterlands, Loch Modan, Northern Stranglethorn, Northshire, Redridge Mountains, Silverpine Forest, Tirisfal Glades, Western Plaguelands and Westfall are ready for testing.<br>
<br>
Kalimdor<br>
<br>
Most zones in Kalimdor are available for testing, though work continues on polishing the quest experience and flow, as well as zone aesthetics.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br>
Blackrock Caverns, a new level 80-81 five-player dungeon, is available for testing.<br>

Classes: General<br>
All hunter and warlock pets have been deleted to address a data corruption issue. Hunters will need to tame new pets, while warlocks will notice the names of their pets have changed.<br>
Ammo has been removed from the game.<br>
The character levels at which classes gain new spells and abilities have changed.<br>
The glyph system is in the process of being altered. Existing glyphs may not be fully supported or functional.<br>
Many item and class stats have been changed or removed.<br>
Rage has been normalized.<br>
Spells and abilities no longer have multiple ranks and now scale with character level.<br>
A first pass on new talent trees has been implemented.<br>
Each specialization has been reduced to a 31-point talent tree.<br>
Players will now get a total of 41 talent points to spend.<br>
31 points must be spent in the primary specialization tree before any points can be placed in additional trees.<br>
Players will be asked to choose a specialization at level 10. Doing so will result in the unlocking of a spell or ability unique to that specialization, as well as one or more passive bonuses.<br>
More information regarding our plans for talent trees can be found here: http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/4p0/classandmastery.xml<br>

Soul Shards have been removed from the game as items. Instead, they now exist as a resource system necessary for using, or altering the mechanics of certain spells.<br>
<br>
<br>
Professions<br>
The Reforging interface has been implemented, however it may not currently be hooked up correctly to the corresponding NPCs.<br>
<br>
<br>
User Interface<br>
The ability to use third-party addons has been temporarily disabled for the test environment.<br>
The Arena Teams pane has been improved.<br>
Auto-quests have been added to the game. Players will automatically be given an auto-quest by entering specific areas in the game world. This alert will appear distinctly in the Objectives pane via the Advanced Quest Tracking feature. These quests will still be given to players with full Quest Logs, but will count toward the 25 total allotted quests if the log is not full.<br>
The Character pane has been redesigned. Character stats can now be shown or hidden via the Show All Details/Hide All Details button on the bottom left. When shown, all character stats will be visible in a window to the right of the pane. Stat sections can be reorganized by clicking and dragging them up or down the pane.<br>
The Professions panes now have more filtering and search functionality, as well as buttons to easily link recipes in the chat frame.<br>
Many of the yellow System Messages that would display in the chat frame when leveling up have been removed.<br>
New text animations now alert players as they level up, also providing information on when new talents, spells and abilities are available.<br>
Professions and Class Trainers windows have been altered to more clearly display available and upcoming purchases.<br>
Raid frames are now available and have temporarily replaced the standard party frames so that players can test them.<br>
The Spellbook interface has been improved for greater ease-of-use and visual appeal.<br>
<br>
<br>
Graphics<br>
Experimental support for DX11 (can be enabled by passing &#x2018;-d3d11&#x2019; on the command line or adding SET gxApi &quot;d3d11&quot; to the Config.WTF file).<br>
OpenGL Hardware Cursor support (can be enabled on the Video Resolution Panel).<br>
Improved water and lava rendering system (enabled by the Liquid Detail slider on the Video Effects Panel)<br>

These values are likely to change during Beta.<br>
<br>

Known Issues<br>
Sudden Death procs do not reset the cooldown of Colossus Smash.<br>
Several cloaks are displayed incorrectly on draenei females.<br>
Ground mounts can be used when underwater in Vashj&apos;ir.<br>
Corpses are not tapped on the quest &quot;Free Your Mind&quot; allowing other players to use the Sovereign Rod on targets they did not kill.<br>
While on the quest &quot;Blood and Thunder!&quot; NPCs will despawn prior to the event and the quest cannot be completed.<br>

Battleground queues are undergoing significant changes and are not currently operational.<br>
Gnome and troll characters have a broken background displayed as well as a LUA error at the character selection and creation screens. Having either a gnome or troll character can cause newly created characters to not display on the character list until it is refreshed by logging out and back in, switching realms and then switch back, or logging into and back out of the realm.<br>
Players are currently unable to create new worgen characters.<br>
Selecting high Liquid Detail when using Geforce 6 &amp; 7 series video cards will currently prevent lava and water from rendering properly. You can temporarily restore liquid to the world by reducing the Liquid Detail setting via the Video Effects Panel, or by typing &#x201C;waterDetail 0&#x201D; in your Config.WTF file.<br>
