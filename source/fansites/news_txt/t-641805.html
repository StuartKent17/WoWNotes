MMO-Champion Update - Boss Pages and New Menu!<br>
We&apos;re getting closer to the Patch 3.1 release on live servers and I finally had the time to push live a nice menu for all the patch 3.1 content and a nicer version of all the ulduar bosses pages! There is still a few bugs with it but they should be fixed as soon as possible. <br>
<br>
You can expect a few more categories and pages very soon, today&apos;s update is merely to make sure that I stop postponing it. <br>
