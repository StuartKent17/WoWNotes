WotLK Beta Epic Arena Gear
With the opening of the Vault of Archavon a few days ago, more and more Deadly Gladiator's items are dropped on test realms and we've got enough of them to do a post. This is also a good way to move the Hateful Gladiator sets from the raid loot list, don't look for them here anymore 

Season 5 - ilvl 213 Weapons
Nothing for the moment.

Season 5 - ilvl 213 Armor Pieces
These items are currently dropping from Archavon, a raid boss available to players belonging to the faction in control of Lake Wintergrasp. Right now the boss is largely undertuned and we're not even sure that the Deadly Gladiator's gear will drop from this guy even if it seems likely, anything here could be a placeholder to keep players interested in testing the encounter. 

Note - Due to the low amount of items discovered, we also added comparisons with lower quality versions of each items to give you an idea of the stats increase between sets. Models for these armors aren't available yet / are most likely placeholders and you'll have to wait a later patch to see how they look.

No doubt many awesome small tweaks I am forgetting. AWESOME SMALL TWEAKS. 


Blue posts
We had a small bug with the blue tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/ during the night and it stopped updating for a few hours, this is now fixed. There are also a lot of posts concerning small bugs on PTRs that we just didn't report, check the tracker if you're really interested in that. 
PTR - Character Copy
Following the release of patch 3.0.2 for testing, we are seeing some incredibly high levels of activity on the Public Test Realm. As a result, the system is still struggling to handle the very large numbers of players attempting to copy their character, and the character copy queue is thus currently full.

Basically, when a player starts the character copy process, the system places the copied character in temporary storage and adds the copy to a queue. When this queue reaches maximum capacity, the ability to start a new character copy is temporarily turned off to allow the queue to be processed, the characters copied and for the temporary storage to be emptied.

If you try to copy a character and receive an error message at any step of the process, please try again after a little while.

We’re thrilled by the huge interest players have in testing this patch, and we apologise sincerely to all those who are still waiting to copy characters. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/5901530208-1609-character-copy.html

PTR - Stuck in instances
Normally when you logout in an instance, your character is hearthed back to their bind point if you log back in after the instance has closed. However, there is an issue with Character Copy that will not allow this to occur. You'll need to move the character that you intend to copy to a public place, like a capital city, and perform the transfer again. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/10043234532-bug-stuck-part-deux.html

Onyxia's Attunement Removed
The attunement requirements for Onyxia's Lair have been lifted. The Alliance quests had to be removed due to King Wrynn's return. As I said in the quest forum, we'll try and come back to this one and adjust the questline to work with the current timeline. That won't happen for launch. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10043084302-wheres-katrana-prestor.html

King Wrynn & Sylvanas Windrunner models
Our artists are hard at work getting new models for King Wrynn and Sylvanas ready. We'll hopefully have them up in the build after next. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10043164414-please-tell-me-king-varian-model-a-ph.html

That's a good idea, Jory. I'll add some tonight. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/9956306400-training-dummies-in-ebon-hold.html

The Seeds of the Blacksouled Keepers
The Seeds of the Blacksouled Keepers quest should be less frustrating and more resistant to griefing in the next beta update. The spores now spawn on their own, so killing the Blacksouled Keepers won’t interfere with people who are trying to do the quest. The quest now asks you to freeze the corpses of the spores, rather than having you kill them while frozen.

DK Tanking - Having a hard time
I don't think the parry speed up should be a major factor in 5-player instances. It may come into play in some raid encounters, but without crushing blows you shouldn't hit too many big number in a row even in those cases.

Now it is possible that DK mitigation is just too low. It isn't our intent that you go put together an awesome tanking set while leveling up to do Nexus and Halls of Stone. We are tuning those instances so that you don't need them, but also realize that a lot of people who are running them now are doing so in Sunwell gear and are basing their experiences on that. We recently made some changes to improve DK tanking. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/9336799952-dk-tanking--having-a-hard-time.html

Death Coil Sigil
By chance do you have the Death Coil sigil? It still had values for the older DC damage so it's a little too good for DC in its current state. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10043084806-what-do-you-do-with-runic-power.html

AoE Spells changes
Unholy Blight -- does not cause Blood Plague. No cooldown. Lasts as long as we can make it last for the damage it does -- ideally 20 sec. Counts as a disease for purposes of DK abilities. It might be an okay tanking ability, but should do good damage in longer fights too. At 20 sec it might be perma up if you forsake other runic power abilities, which is probably fine. Remember we are buffing Death Coil too though.

Death and Decay -- the fear component became a glyph. This will allow base damage to come up, making it a more useful tanking and general AE ability.

Pestilence -- limited by its area which stays the same but no target limit. We found the argument compelling that without Challenging Shout, and since it requires an additional step to apply the disease, that this is probably fine. At worst, Pestilence's disease might have to come down a little or it might need a short cooldown to prohibit spamming, but I don't think any of you will mind. The glyph will change to enlarge its radius. 

Bug - Can't learn Death Gate spell from quest
We're looking into the cause of this bug. The only advice that I can give to death knights that have experienced this problem is to find a friendly warlock and get summoned out of the Scarlet Enclave. Once you finish the Light of Dawn you are able to be summoned, etc... Meeting stone summons should also work.

I know this isn't a great solution, but short of starting over, it's the only solution for now. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/14/9956647500-bug-learning-deathgate-spell-from-quest.html

Spirit for balance druids
Spirit to crit might be too good. The way moonkins stack crit, things might get out of control fast. Spirit to damage is more likely. If your damage is low, and I agree it might be, we want to buff that through base spell damage and coefficients. We aren't likely to do it by making talents do more and more per talent point. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/9957009423-re-balance--gc-or-koraa.html

Current issues with Druid
The problem we were trying to solve with Feral was that they could only be 75% of a rogue and 75% of a Prot warrior to be fair, the warrior part sometimes got to be 102%, but the rogue part never did. We wanted to let people who liked the melee hybrid playstyle keep doing that, while also having true dps and tanking Ferals.

The problem we were trying to solve with Balance was in some ways easier and harder. Balance just needed to get a spot in the group. Balance needed reasonable CC in 5-player instances and good dps, AE, buff capacity and mana-efficiency to be a credible caster. Making sure raids didn't need all 10 or 25 spots devoted to stacking buffs helps open up space as well.

Resto druids are pretty amazing on Live and have a pretty good healer niche. What we wanted to do with them is expand on their healing a little so they had more group-heal capacity and more spells to cast besides rolling Lifebloom.

With regard to PvP, we want to try and get some of the under-represented classes and specs in there more, but that's a much, much harder problem. PvP balance is enormously sensitive to certain small changes and to the presence and absence of certain abilities. We try to avoid just handing out the mandatory abilities to everyone hello Mortal Strike for fear that we end up with 10 classes that are just art differences. It's a non-trivial problem to solve, complicated by the fact that testing it is hard and requires not only skilled participants, but also for the rest of the game to be in a really stable state. We've changed the game so much, that I can almost promise that PvP is going to be very different. How, exactly, I'm not sure anyone could say yet. I gaurantee that we've broken something for good or ill for at least a couple of classes, because that's the reality of the situation. Hopefully we can be more proactive about fixing problems when they arise. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/9956329248-gc-thanks-for-the-feral-feeback--really-.html

Feral Concerns
I understand you want your gear designed to specifically support those stats that are most important to you. I'm telling you that you are dangerously close to being the best tank from a mitigation-standpoint even without it. I suppose it's possible your threat generation will be very low, but I kind of doubt it.

If your concern is you'll have to wear PvP gear or BC gear because it's better than LK gear, don't worry about that. In fact, that also answers the question of why we can't put strength on some leather without doing it to all leather -- because then those few sacred pieces become the only ones that can / will be used.

If your concern is that your gear won't scale, don't worry about that either. The only reason it became a problem in BC was because you hit the armor cap, which led to you not wanting more mitigation and us not making more tanking bear armor. It wasn't that we hit the max stat budgets in BC, if I am understanding that concern correctly, or you wouldn't see 200 ilevels now.

If you want armor on your leather because you like hitting the armor cap, sorry. This is one of the few times you'll hear me say no, but no. It does bad things to the game.

If your concern is that you just like having leather with strength, armor, stamina, dodge and agility on it, and don't want to see AP or defense because partialy-wasted stats just creep you out, *and* you would rather have druid talents and bear form nerfed to compensate for that, well I guess that is a different way to design the game. It would probably work okay, but it would mean going back to a model where bosses dropped rogue loot or feral loot. We just think the current design works better.

On an entirely different topic, I also understand that you want to have more interesting abilities to use on a regular basis. That's a fair request, and one that is made by several other classes as well. It's something we will keep talking about and keeping a close eye on. It wasn't our priority for the Feral this time around, but I can understand how you wish it was.

My hope is that this giant wall of text helps you understand our thought process, and helps you feel that yes we do listen to you, and yes we do understand how the class works. If it doesn't convince you, well there's always tomorrow. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/9956327974-feral-concerns-release-date-announced.html
