Wait ... Another preview of the Tier 10 Armor Sets? Yes, and I have a pretty good reason to do it. Apparently Blizzard used low/medium-resolution textures for their preview and most of the sets really looked uglier than they actually are. Let&apos;s say this is the HD armor sets preview! <br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight - Higher resolution and 4 recolors available. Helm is still missing. <br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid - Higher resolution, 3 recolors available.<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter - Higher resolution, 3 recolors available.<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue - Not in Blizzard&apos;s preview, 3 recolors available. (And found the Shoulders as well!) <br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior - Higher resolution, 4 recolors available.<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid Additional note: Blizzard used the same helm for both sets in their preview, I didn&apos;t. The model of this helm is kinda bugged at the moment and only supports one texture directly hardcoded in the .m2 file. I just decided to fix it and make sure that the colors of the helms match the armors, I&apos;m not sure if what we saw in Blizzard&apos;s preview is a design choice or a bug. <br>
