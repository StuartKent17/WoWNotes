Artifact Weapon Quests<br>
You won&apos;t be able to start a new Artifact quest chain off until you finish the one you most recently started. So you&apos;ll need to head back to the point you were on with your Balance quest chain and continue from there. These quest chains aren&apos;t too long so it shouldn&apos;t take too much time, plus there&apos;s an achievement to be had for obtaining all the Artifacts for your class.<br>
<br>
Once you&apos;ve obtained the Balance Artifact and finished the chain, you&apos;ll then be able to choose another Artifact weapon to pursue.

<br>
Hardcore vs Casual<br>
I think it&apos;s easy to define people by their &quot;progression&quot;.<br>
<br>
Raids are a good example - I would never see someone as as &quot;casual&quot; player if they are investing into Mythic raids during progression periods (sans carry). Most of that is to do with the amount of playtime investment required, so you could also take that as a major factor. <br>
<br>
A hardcore player would also do as much as they can to maximize their playtime to the extreme, while a casual player would be fine enjoying the game within its constraints and limitations without pushing too hard.<br>
<br>
Either way, I think it&apos;s obvious that a majority of the player base would be defined as casual within this, no?<br>
<br>
I would substitute mythic raid for raid commitments on a schedule to be non-casual. Spending half of your non-raiding time figuring out flasks and other raid attributed stuff pushes you into hardcore. So it is almost like a 3rd label is missing. Casual -- Something else -- Hardcore.<br>
I agree with everything you said. Time commitment, set-up, and strategic planning pushes Hardcore.<br>
<br>
Something in between is an interesting thought as well, somewhere I&apos;d probably fall at the moment. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/774404-hardcore-vs-casual/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20749795836?page=4#69))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Hi Greg, in a scenario where players abused a bug to become the best in a multiplayer game (ex: insidia getting the world first kill on the lich king), do you think taking action ( temporary ban, claw back the rewards etc.) against these players is justified? It was the game team&apos;s fault after all. <br>
I understand your point, but I think that argument can be taken to extremes pretty easily. What if my raiding guild orchestrated a DDOS attack designed to knock out the servers right when a rival guild was about to get a kill? After all, the tech team should be able to handle the attack, right? Even if you&apos;re talking about a single raiding guild, is hacking the client okay? Is using a mod that provides info that is available but trivializes the fight okay? Is exploiting the boss pathfinding okay?<br>
<br>
These things are subjective, and the times I was invovled (like the LK one) we often had to make hard calls in the heat of the moment while watching those attempts. We tried to err on the side of what most players would find reasonable. Using an unusual talent build or having a warlock tank feel like clever problem-solving. Interacting with terrain geometry starts to get dicey. I would also hate to see devs stick to very simple fight designs just because having fewer moving parts would make it easier to feel secure about there being zero chance of a tech limitation. That collapsing platform in LK was a big part of the fight, but also pushing the engine to its limits. (Source (http://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler/answers/140687314315))<br>
