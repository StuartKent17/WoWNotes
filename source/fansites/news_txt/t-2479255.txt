Magni Essence Quest Chain
Th PTR currently lets you start an epic quest chain to unlock your first essence and upgrade it all the way to max rank!


An Earthen Guardian in your capitol city gives you the quest "Essential Empowerment" to meet Magni in The Chamber of Heart.
There, Magni tells you MOTHER has finished her calculations. Upon talking to her, there is a placeholder cutscene and she tells you to seek out essences to power up the Heart of Azeroth, the first being a dragon essence in Neltharion's Lair in Highmountain.
You meet with Spiritwalker Ebonhorn outside, who says that the essence must be an echo of the power of the dragonflights, and has Navarogg tunnel you inside.
There we must quell the elements by sealing 4 ruptures. Ebonhorn then sense that the essence is being held by a rock elemental giant. We confront him for the essence, but he wants us to prove ourselves in combat first.
He relinquishes the essence when defeated, and Ebonhorn requests to accompany you to the Chamber of Heart to offer his expertise.
Magni is introduced to the Tauren before telling you to meet him at Nordrassil in Hyjal. This grants you the rank 1 essence.
At this point Kalecgos is also inside the Chamber of Heart and says the Emerald Dream is being invaded by the void. He tells you to meet Merithra the green dragon at the Temple of Elune in Val'sharah.
Heading to Hyjal first, the area under Nordrassil has become overrun with Azerite elementals. Once you cleanse the area of the creatures, a giant Azerite Leviathan shows up in the lake that needs to be defeated. Magni remarks that the Heart of Azeroth is meant to heal, not hurt and then tells you to return to the Heart Chamber.
Magni then says another problem has occurred at the Maelstrom and has MOTHER teleport you there.
The Maelstrom has been overrun much like Nordrassil. You have to cleanse this area as well and then defeat an Azerite giant that the shamans have been trying to quell.
Kalecgos's quest has you head to Val'sharah. When you meet up with Merithra, she takes you into the Emerald Dream where you must collect emerald essences, destroy void creatures, and try to wake green dragons succumbing to the void. It seems like the void creatures are sucking the life from the dragons, and some cannot wake up at all. You eventually go deeper into the Emerald Dream.
Here, you must destroy 3 giant void tentacles to bring out a void terror. After killing it, you begin the ritual to cleanse the dragon essence from Neltharion's Lair and receive rank 2 of the essence. You are then tasked to bring it back to the Chamber of Heart, where Merithra will be waiting.

Note: There is a chest on the map inside a cave here that has void tendrils. Upon clicking the, you receive an item called "Remnant of the Void. The tooltip says "Drops of Void linger on the petals." It is unknown what this is used for as of now.

At the Heart Chamber, Kalecgos says he hasn't heard from Alexstraza in the Twilight Highlands after reaching out to the other Dragonflights, so he has you meet him there to investigate.
Kalecgos was unable to make it fully to the Vermilion Redoubt as something is keeping them out of the sky. You then enter a scenario where you have to fend off void-twisted drakes to reach Alexstraza while Kalecgos flies above, freezing enemies periodically so they take additional damage.
When you reach Alexstraza, her and Kalecgos fight off the lead twilight drake, Vexiona, as she taunts them to submit. On the ground, you rescue 5 red dragons. Vexiona wants to unite all dragonflights as twilight drakes, but obviously that doesn't go over well. Alexstraza chases her and you meet up with Kalacgos and fly with him to confront the twilight drake.
The two aspects are subdued by corruptors that you have to kill in order for them and have Kalecgos freeze Vaxiona. Alexstraza says that the aspects will defend Azeroth to their dying breath, and Vexiona flees before we can kill her, saying that she will find others who will join her cause.
You take the Lost Scale of the Scarlet Broodmother and meet Alexstraza back the Chamber of Heart. This gives you rank 3 of the essence.
Kalecgos then tells you that he found a remnant of his flight's power, and it can be used by Magni to give you the rank 4 legendary version of the essence that you have been upgrading, which gives you a cosmetic animation for the ability. As of now there is an "awesome in-game cutscene that is missing."
The Essence is The Crucible of Flame, which has a major ability that does damage or healing when used, doubling with each cast until it is used 3x, in which it resets. It has two chargers and each cast also increases your critical strike for 5 seconds, which is similar to the minor passive that gives your abilities the chance to increase your critical strike. The animation hurls a ball of Azerite at the target.
