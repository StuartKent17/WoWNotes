WotLK Prologue - Undead attacks on capital cities !
It seems that the big part of the WotLK prologue just started ! More updates to come as we gather more information about this.

Abominations and Frostwyrms are assaulting capital cities
Faction Leaders have been moved around to help with the defense
The event seems to repeat itself a few minutes after it ends
Few changes have been made to the "old" parts of the events, most of the Argent NPCs are gone, battle count has been reset, etc ...
