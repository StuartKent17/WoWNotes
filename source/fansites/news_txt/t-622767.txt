WotLK Prologue - Undead attacks on capital cities !
It seems that the big part of the WotLK prologue just started ! More updates to come as we gather more information about this.

Abominations and Frostwyrms are assaulting capital cities
Faction Leaders have been moved around to help with the defense
The event seems to repeat itself a few minutes after it ends
Few changes have been made to the "old" parts of the events, most of the Argent NPCs are gone, battle count has been reset, etc ...

Stormwind
Varian Wrynn , Bolvar Frodragon , Broll Bearmantle , Valeera Sanguinar  are at the Stormwind Harbor, ready to lead the defense of Stormwind.

Sylvanas Windrunner  and Garrosh Hellscream  try to convince Thrall to send his forces to Northrend. Thrall doesn't want to fall into a trap and get challenged by Garrosh in the Ring of Valor, Garrosh almost wins but the fight gets interrupted when undeads attack Orgrimmar. At the end of the fight Thrall finally agrees to send the horde to Northrend
