Registrations for WotLK Beta open
The registrations for the Wrath of the Lich King Beta are now available ! For the moment you can only reach the page on the European Account Management Page  and the "Beta Opt-in" link that was on the american account page vanished today. That's probably temporary and we'll warn you as soon as it's available.


 

Today we opened the Wrath of the Lich King Beta Opt-In program, which gives players a chance to win an invitation to the upcoming Wrath of the Lich King beta. For The Burning Crusade beta, we randomly invited players from the entire World of Warcraft community. With the Opt-In, our goal is to strengthen the beta-testing process by inviting only those players who have expressed active interest in participating.

Keep in mind that opting in doesn’t guarantee you’ll be selected for the beta.

To opt in to the Wrath of the Lich King beta, visit the Beta Opt-In page.  EU
