Access to 5.0.1 PTR and Mists of Pandaria Beta<br>
Patch 5.0.1 is right around the corner on test realms! It also means that the release of MoP isn&apos;t too far either. <br>
We will soon begin public testing of patch 5.0.1 of World of Warcraft, a patch that will precede the Mists of Pandaria release, and includes many features and functions that are new to the game.<br>
<br>
We encourage all players who wish to test patch 5.0.1 with us to take careful note of the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
It will not be possible to access the 5.0.1 PTR realms with a game account that accesses the Mists of Pandaria Beta.<br>
If a game account has been flagged with a Mists of Pandaria Beta license, it can only be used to enter Beta realms.<br>
This limitation is on each World of Warcraft license, and is not Battle.net account-based.<br>
While testing 5.0.1, players will not be able to access zones or content that is a part of the Mists of Pandaria expansion.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your continued support of our testing and tuning process. We look forward to seeing you in-game.</div></div>
