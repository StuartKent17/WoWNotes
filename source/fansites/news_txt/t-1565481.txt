Garrison Lumber
We're watching the spawns and experiences people are having. It's an easy enough number to tune. The question is: Are you just hanging around one zone or are you moving around? What tier is your LM? At level 1 it's going to be more difficult to fill your work orders since you can only log small timber. Also, timber spawns are much more plentiful in Spires/Nagrand.

Good feedback. Few notes:

Lumber Mill level 2 and all medium plot blueprints for that matter unlock at level 98 on the blueprint vendor. You can also get a token for a medium building by completing the Spires of Arak building quest chain.
Small timber exists in every zone except Frostfire. Spires is probably the most densely spawned with small timber, with Talador a close second.
You can currently use timber to buy a few more things and we'll try to add more. At the very least if you ever manage to get Phylarch you'll likely want a steady supply on hand for Everbloom Seeds.

That said, we'll take a look at the spawn points. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/329835-sooo-about-the-lumber/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13682248279?page=1#8

Next Beta Build
We weren't able to get a new full build deployed this week aside from the minor fastpatch we did on Wednesday to fix some Garrison issues, but we're hoping to get a beta build out to you all early next week.

Thanks for being patient, and thanks for testing! Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/329757-will-we-see-a-new-beta-build-today/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13680208005?page=1#18

Blood Elf Model Delay
yes but it was expected to be more than one race. Not having half done for the release actually feels better to me than leaving out one.
Yeah I understand that, feeling like the odd one out. But just think about that patch when you do get your updated model. Everyone else's models will be common by then, everyone will have been seeing them every day. But when the new Blood Elf model goes in it's going to be a new thing, and everyone will be focused on you and how fancy you look.

Sounds like the kind of 'fashionably late' style a Blood Elf would appreciate. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/329715-no-blood-elf-models-in-wod-launch/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13681698157?page=2#35

Warlords of Draenor Theorycraft Discussion
On beta, haste is not affecting Healing Stream Totem nor Healing Tide Totem tics. Is that intended?
Rejoice, for we have rebuilt Healing Stream Totem and Healing Tide Totem. They now will function 100% like any other periodic effect. No more fuzzy haste breakpoints due to server laziness of despawning totems. You even get partial ticks of them due to haste.

Check it out in the next beta build. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/318876-warlords-of-draenor-theorycraft-discussion/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13087818929?page=27#540

this is the same for most hybrids, 1 gcd vs scores to throw out rejuvs, healing touches
We absolutely do not balance utility by expecting anyone to switch to primarily healing. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492889072969318401
The fact that a Boomkin could stop DPSing and throw Rejuvs on the raid does not factor into it at all. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492889188870520832
The fact that they could keep DPSing and let Ysera's Gift or Nature's Vigil do a ton of healing *does* though. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492889322199068672
Sorry if I ever gave the impression that we are counting "stop DPSing and Flash of Light" as raid utility. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492889572116684800
Dream of Cenarius, Heart of the Wild? If NV healing is = increased healing from amp magic, that's nice.
Heart of the Wild is a separate beast of its own. It's an option to provide *WAY* more utility, at a DPS loss. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492892166104965120
The availability of HotW is not what Druid utility is based around. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492892259382091778

In the simplest possible terms, using other abilities other than Frost Strike is punitive and inefficient.
Not if it doesn't cause you to lose Frost Strikes... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492891887133405185
Except it does, runic power becomes runes, runes become RP, it is all connected, inefficient in 1 area affects all
The conversion from RP to Dmg/Runes is better for Frost than the others. But so what? They're balanced around it Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492893135081467905
It's a leaky bucket. As long as it never overflows, it doesn't matter whether you pull RP or Runes out first. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492893728080547840

What would your response be to nixing 2H out of Frost entirely? Would save yourself from further headaches.
Response would be "No." Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/493840921121660929
May I ask why? I am honestly trying to figure out the need for both, no trolling.
Because that's the defined style of the spec. Changing that now would be gigantic. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/493841829712773120

This makes 2 niche talents for Feral at level 100. Are you that confident that the majority of Ferals will be happy with LI?
I don't understand. Shirvallah is the opposite of a niche talent. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/493097249753141248

Why not just make the Divine Storm free of cost? That way it's less clunky and people who want DS happy?
That'd make it used for single target. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492882662114070529

I'm curious is there any reason why DS shouldn't be allowed single target? I mean both DK's and Warriors AoE single target.
It's not that it's AoE so much as it's added complication. That talent is intended to be the one with minimal gameplay impact. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492898418088366081
However, I'm not quite sure how the Divine Storm proc from Final Verdict being free would add much more complication.
It adds an additional button to your single target rotation. That's pretty objectively added complication. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492901262413676544
True, but would it not be more confusing to people to see they have a Divine Storm proc that they *Shouldn't* use single target?
A fair question. It's something we're weighing. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492901942180335616

So for AoE you want to weave in Final Verdicts everytime you want to Divine Storm? Or is the proc worth it ST?
Proc will not make it worth it, single target. But it will make it so you want to alternate them for AoE. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492877379933442048
wait...if it's a 100% buff, isn't it a complete wash compared to just using DS exclusively?
Except you can do it ahead of time, and you also got the FV damage too. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883185584197634

So, Rets had too much raid utility...if that were true they'd be guaranteed spots in raid/wanted a lot more.
No, damage throughput has a lot to do with that too. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883024099303424

Don't know how I feel about this...I would like to ask you why remove raid utility from a hybrid but give to a pure dps?
Because pure vs hybrid isn't relevant to this. The goal is parity for all. Anyone we removed it from had too much. Some had none. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492881299904794625
Do you value all utility as equal or is there more to it?
The value of utility is very hard to balance; commonly totally subjective. Tough calls to make, but we try. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492882785703428096
You are taking away from a class that sees little play and giving to a class that was already well off.
There are no 'giving from one to the other' things here. And many other changes are involved. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883486185771010
Remember, the goal is *balance*. Equality. That should be what you want. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883551633694723
Devo Aura was the only reason Rets were used in MoP. We will be in less raids now.
You lost Devo... Others lost a ton too. Overall raid cooldown utility went way down. Again: *balance*. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492884799825010689

... I understand if offheals are far stronger than live/healers weaker but ret flash of light vs smoke bomb?
Ret utility is easy to overlook because it's not as blatant as Smoke Bomb. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883757087485952
There is, however, a ton of it. Many are situational, but some subsection is always useful. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883980530626561
Hand of Sacrifice. Hand of Protection. Hand of Purity. Double all those Hands. Sacred Shield. Lay on Hands. ...cont Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492884180120768513
Lay on Hands. Level 90 talents' offhealing. Hand of Freedom. Divine Shield. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492884508387975169
So how do you balance this? Do we do more damage than rogues seeing as we trade massive dmg for our utility compared?
What? How do you trade "massive damage" for your utility? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492887367246561280
Considering you count exec sentence as part of our utility, which is a pretty large dmg loss to use that way.
I was mostly referring to Light's Hammer or Holy Prism, if we tune that better. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492888629417488384
That's still a single target dmg loss to take those...I assume you wouldn't tune them better single target
But most fights are not single target. Light's Hammer is the top simcraft DPS talent on many fights, anyway. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492889879781466112

Claws of Shirvallah female model?
It's something we're considering for the future, but didn't have a female equivalent ready in the available time. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492874230573182976

I dont get why the Claws of Shirvallah model has to use all fours. Makes more sense to stand upright but love it regardless.
It runs on all fours, fights while standing hunched forward a bit. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492874596735922176

I've just seen the warrior elite pvp set. who am i buying drinks for to repay them?

Lore
Which gods is the Raven Mother referring to here? Rukhmar and Anzu? http://t.co/w6VLUVxp9Y
She is referring to Rukhmar and Sethe. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493190365168820224
Are Rukhmar and Anzu children of the Raven Mother?
No, the Raven Mother is Anzu's consort - a demigod he left in charge of the ravens. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493190697064103937

So Terokk and Anzu were definitely presented as evil in tBC. Now they're painted in a much more positive light. So, what happened? Did they turn evil in those 30 years? Or are we missing something?
Sorry if it's not totally clear! It's a story-heavy zone, and we are missing a few events to help explain things. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493455041676578816
They are both grappling with the curse and on the downward spiral. In BC Anzu is called back by the Sethekk. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493453953753817088
Terokk was pretty dark in his final days. Ultimately it's the player who sways the arakkoa away from evil in the WoD timeline. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493454385301553153
Without you they have no champions. They become increasingly dire and desperate. The Sethekk gain power. It just spirals from there _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493454697676537856

did garrosh want to come to our timeline? Or he wanted to come to 35 years ago azeroth first war and kairoz changed it?

I'm also not a fan of how the Ashran hubs use 100% Garrison assets. It doesn't feel unique or fun. It feels forced and stale.
Happy to report that lots of level design work still being done here! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/493203166096539649

There is level 100 content in all the Draenor zones. We gotta portal to get back there. Boy, Ashran bases sure are near the fun.
Your garrison is the centerpoint between all of these things, and is really your main "hub," filled with many races/factions. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/493196840179736576
I really don't get why "Garrison 2" is better than interaction between the garrison and the important location it is defending.
Totally agree with you, needs to feel important to the world, lots of work still being done on this! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/493202779922792448
You CAN'T make it important to the world. It's a second, public garrison. All it does is make YOUR garrison feel LESS important.
Oh, you meant Ashran, I meant Garrisons in general Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/493205776962699264

Uhh... I've seen Stormshield, and I've seen Karabor... You tell me which is more aesthetically pleasing.
Karabor will have vendors, and you can go there and do w/e you want, it's not going anywhere. Not sure why the anger on this. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/493170147830419456
I just think players are tired of the Orcs and Humans thing. It'd be really cool to see Kara/BSF actually being used by players.
TBH If I had infinite time, I'd rather do a shared hub in Auchindoun or somewhere new/cool that has that Shatt/Dal vibe. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/493206198544789504
