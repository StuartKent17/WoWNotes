The Iron Maidens
With little opportunity to exercise her tactical brilliance under the ancient social structure of the orc clans, Gar'an was thrilled to be one of the first warriors to volunteer for naval duty under the Iron Horde. Instantly successful in battle, she was named Admiral of the Iron Horde fleet and selected Marak and Sorka as her lieutenants. Together, they are called the Iron Maidens, and have crushed any who have dared face them in battle.


Overview - The Iron Maidens periodically gain Iron Fury. As the Maidens gain Iron Fury, they gain new abilities. Periodically, one of the Maidens will move to bombard players from the Dreadnaught's main cannon. A team of players must use loading chains to get to the deck of the boat, defeat the Deckhand stationed there, and sabotage the ammunition of the main cannon before it finishes <a href="http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/158849-warming-up">Warming Up</a>. Whenever one of the Maidens reaches 20% health, they will all activate <a href="http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/159337-iron-will">Iron Will</a>.

Gift of the Serpent Changes
We're making some significant changes to the proc coefficients on Gift of the Serpent, for each heal. These are, on average, massive buffs to the proc rate. 

Here are the latest coefficients, for the theorycrafters:

Spell ID Spell Name Gift of the Serpent Proc Coefficient
119611 Renewing Mists 0.25
132463 Chi Wave 0.25
124081 Zen Sphere Periodic 0.20
124101 Zen Sphere Detonate 0.20
130654 Chi Burst 0.20
115175 Soothing Mists 0.67
125953 Soothing Mists Statue 0.33
132120 Enveloping Mist 0.25
116670 Uplift 0.40
130316 Uplift Glyphed 0.40
126890 Eminence Self & Xuen 0.27
117895 Eminence Statue 0.13
124040 Chi Torpedo 0.45

115310 Revival 1.00
116995 Surging Mist 1.00
115072 Expel Harm 1.00

*crosses talons that formatting works*

EDIT: Fixed the Spell ID on Enveloping Mist. Sorry for the typo. Also added Uplift Glyphed for clarity, even though it's the same coefficient as Uplift, but is a different Spell ID.

EDIT 2: Decided to adjust this so that it is purely a buff, regardless of spell selection. Tweaked the coefficients for Renewing Mists and Zen Sphere Periodic.

Discussed this further, and are going to revise it so that it's purely a buff, no nerfs. See edits to the previous post. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/343128-tune-gift-of-the-serpent-properly/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14729563047?page=2#24


Blue Tweets
PvE
Normal and Heroic difficulties are flexible now, too, and we have a cross-realm group finder not LFR to help find raid members. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517369952362172416
There are also big world bosses, and max-level outdoor areas meant for groups. Should be lots to do for a group-oriented player! _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517370349009502208

PvP
hey, will rated arenas also reward you with strongboxes/gold or only skirmish?
Only skirmish. Rated is still conquest. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517351146483359745

Lore
Second, I agree to a certain point on 5.0 but how do you see the Alliance? Protagonist? Antagonists? Both?
In MoP Ally end up as guardians. Anduin urges his father to protect Pandaria from Garrosh's conquest. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517381716806496258
At the same time you do have the Alliance proactively seeking power especially 5.2 while holding off Horde aggression. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517381936822906881
I do understand concerns about Alliance feeling reactionary. However, I feel like heroes usually react to villains, don't they? _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517382311588159490
We did run purely Alliance threads through MoP Varian's trials and relationship with his son, the Dark Iron stepping up, etc. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517383174935293952

but to the main point when did the Alliance drive the story in MoP? Shieldwall? Purge? Robocat? SoO?
"To Pandaria" as in 5.0 and the level-up experience, pre 5.1. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517369265989488640
find reacting as long at the same time we push our story many treads make a tapestry. Many views make a story have depth .
But yes, you're absolutely right that we need to continue weaving in more threads. We can always do better. Ty for the feedback! _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517384606577082369

Garrisons
all level 3 buildings require tier 3 garrison nite_moogle https://twitter.com/nite_moogle/status/519175971958554624

Will the Character Creation Screen Armors be class exclusive or can any class of that armor type use them?
you can only obtain the character screen armor for your class. aa https://twitter.com/nite_moogle/status/519291315196928000
Thanks for the add in. I was hoping for no class restriction due to Monks having fewer sets available.
the character screen sets are very iconic to each class, and we wanted to preserve that. aa https://twitter.com/nite_moogle/status/519306612037517312
