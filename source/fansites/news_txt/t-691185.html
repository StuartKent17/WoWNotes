After checking with a few people, I can confirm that Patch 3.3.2 will not be deployed this week. It also means that Season 8 will not start this week either, as the season cannot start without the patch. <br>
<br>
At this point I&apos;m not sure if it means that we will also have to wait one more week to fight the Lich King. It all depends on whether Blizzard wants to release the encounter and the new season on the same day.<br>

Patch 3.3.2 Patch Notes<br>
A couple of hours ago the korean patch notes appeared on my forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/general-discussions-22/3-32-minor-patch-notes/), I was happily waiting to get an english version but apparently it will be harder than expected. <br>
<br>
I really hate to post that kind of translated notes because the most complicated changes might have translation errors, be careful with them. I&apos;ll try to get an english version up as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
However I had the translation double checked and these notes should be fairly accurate, even if Blizzard&apos;s version will look nicer.<br>
