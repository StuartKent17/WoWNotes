PvE<br>
Personal Loot; The sad part is the amount of duplicate loots you get with it, if you could do something to that it would be better<br>
That&apos;s kinda just loot in general though, it&apos;s been that way since forever, in most RPGs. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601293679731564544))<br>
<br>
Will the 6.2 Personal Loot changes apply to LFR and world bosses or just premade groups?<br>
Yes to Raid Finder, but no plans for world bosses at this time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601454112765415424))<br>
<br>
are mythic dungeons going to be cross-realm?<br>
Yes. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601479203385663490))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
My eternally broken pet menagerie. 6.2 adding some awesome new pet battle content and my enthusiasm is rock bottom thanks to it.<br>
.We&apos;ve been looking into a few of these issues in 6.2, if you can&apos;t get your menagerie working, please let me know! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601307683581464576))<br>
<br>
.Garrison missions for oil on the PTR seem really scarce... intended? Haven&apos;t seen one for 3 days<br>
Intended. Missions will not be your main source of Oil, just a rare bonus opportunity. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601452778616061953))<br>

MMO Designer: What exactly do you want? Every player: TO ANNOY OTHER PEOPLE LOL (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601296025811288064))<br>
<br>
I&apos;m just a dude, with a twitter, but I would very much like to hear what you think isn&apos;t being heard. I hear &quot;not listening&quot; a lot. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601300742704668672))<br>
Often report bugs I find in models. Reports I make dating 2 years ago seem to go unnoticed or low priority. http://t.co/NpiOQKqg7r<br>
The WoW DB has nearly 450,000 bugs total in its lifetime. Would like to fix every one timely, sometimes not possible, but recorded! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601309397382471681))<br>
Example: only recently did a bug get fixed where you are removed from your warrior stance when entering C&apos;thun&apos;s stomach (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601310353159548928))<br>
<br>
At a certain point, you can&apos;t make a game and not care what the audience thinks. Every post or comment is taken to heart. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601304936622723072))<br>
Can you name anyone else at Blizzard that cares about what we think? Since you brought it up.<br>
Everyone. The WC books on the shelf behind me are so worn because so many new designers have read them all. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601312241783308289))<br>
<br>
the sad part is that there will always be those that, no matter how much you listen, will say you&apos;re not listening<br>
Such is the nature of social media The ability to yell at someone anytime, anywhere, about the lack of an Annoy-O-Tron pet. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601305175530274816))<br>
I think you&apos;re all listening, you just have a design philosophy that I disagree with (but I understand it, I think)<br>
I don&apos;t know if you disagree with me, or the design team, but go ahead and tell me more! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601307495550812160))<br>
<br>
your problem is that you asked what they want. just make the awesome game and ignore every1 else<br>
Often, making &quot;awesome&quot; in a vacuum results in the realization that it&apos;s not so great for someone else (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601306011518038017))<br>
<br>
People are heard, they are just not told &quot;we heard you but... yay or nay&quot; back. So they don&apos;t know.<br>
It&apos;s difficult to respond with a community of this size, even with a community team. A challenge! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601309845963317249))<br>
<br>
mobile content. I feel like there&apos;s just a TON of missed opportunities to have mobile games that tie into the mmo gameplay.<br>
Hearthstone did awesome. I think there is still significant meaning in being a Blizzard product. Thus, need to be careful. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601303750263836673))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
PvP<br>
I&apos;m not sure if you can answer this or not but as a pvper, I&apos;m curious. How much weight did PvP balance actually play in WoW?<br>
A lot. In some sense if you tune a game around PvP, the PvE can flow from that. Monsters don&apos;t mind getting nerfed. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599976480890716161))<br>
PvP is harder to test though. Fighting a boss 10 times is a decent sample size. It&apos;s nothing for a PvP match. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599976751834398720))<br>
<br>
Amount of Content<br>
Very curious as to your take on Watcher&apos;s interview.<br>
Ion&apos;s a good friend of mine. I&apos;m not about to throw him under the bus. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599279777510400000))<br>
No bus here, just curiosity. Do you think &quot;it&apos;s cyclical&quot; is a good or even fair way to summate it tho?<br>
Yes. Players come for content and leave when they run out. &quot;But I should never run out of content,&quot; feels unrealistic to me. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599302773708967936))<br>
I do think / know the challenges of creating content faster than players can consume it are very real. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599279937002975233))<br>
Neverending content leads to making things so difficult you can&apos;t progress or asking you to run the same content 100 times. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599303016043261952))<br>
Is there something to be said for the staying power of the content? Or implementing it in a way that allows for a medium?<br>
If there were 40 boss raids, maybe. I get tired of killing the same ones over and over no matter how great they are. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599349431482191872))<br>
Like the PvP content WoW neglects? Is your current job not 100% repeatable content now?<br>
IMO repeatable content is a PvE construct. PvP has a lot of variation because of the players involved. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599975884905254913))<br>
We do add new content, champions being the prime example, but there is less of a burden on a PvP game, again IMO. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599976048168579072))<br>
<br>
Heroes of the Storm<br>
hi what do you think about heros of the strom compare to LoL?<br>
I think they are wisely going for a different kind of moba which makes sense in a crowded market. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599975411599020032))<br>
I think they have a chance to broaden the moba audience, which may be good for everyone. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599975545548328961))<br>
