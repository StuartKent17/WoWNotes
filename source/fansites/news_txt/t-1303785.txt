Boubouille2013-05-28, 11:24 PMTitan project "reset", delayed until 2016
Venturebeat broke the news earlier today http://venturebeat.com/2013/05/28/blizzard-delays-unannounced-mmo-until-2016-resets-whole-project-exclusive/ that Titan has been "reset" and will be delayed until at least 2016. The decision was announced to employees a couple of days ago and sources close to the project gave us more details on the subject:


Blizzard felt that Titan wasn't going in the right direction and decided to make significant technological and design changes to the game. This happened in the past with Starcraft and Warcraft 3.
A smaller dev team will be in charge of redesigning the project and about 60 or 70 developers are being moved to other teams WoW, Blizzard All-Stars, Diablo 3 expansion, Battle.net


Blizzard didn't officially comment on the subject yet, hopefully this is a step in the right direction and Titan won't have the same fate as Starcraft: Ghost.
