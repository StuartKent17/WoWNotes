You can use the stream on giga.de (http://www.giga.de/2/live/free/).<br>
If it doesn&apos;t work install the Octoshape plugin (http://www.octoshape.com/plugin/get.asp) and use http://127.0.0.1:6498/ms/asf/EPGIGA.giga350/Octoshape?MSWMExt=.asf (http://127.0.0.1:6498/ms/asf/EPGIGA.giga350/Octoshape?MSWMExt=.asf) in windows media player. (Yes, I know, it&apos;s a 127.0.0.1 URL but it works, Octoshape knows what to do with it)<br>
<br>
Schedule<br>
See previous post.<br>
<br>
Dalaran<br>
More will come out about that soon but basically the Blue Dragonflight has taken a turn for the worse and the Kirin Tor are concerned about it. What&apos;s about to ensue is a battle over magic and once Dalaran is rebuilt, it will be the staging grounds for that battle<br>
<br>
Engineers<br>
Jeff Kaplan: They&apos;ll be able to craft a new flying machine... that much i can tell you<br>
<br>
Class Panel Q&amp;A<br>
Druid (Moonkin) : Mana issues are being looked at.<br>
Mages : Water Fountain and Muffin Factory are incoming. (No more &quot;WATER PLZ !!!&quot;)<br>
Hunters : Many changes for hunters will be implemented in 2.3, more utilities for arena battles and group utility are planned.<br>
Hunters : Mana issues are being looked at.<br>
Shamans : Crowd Control spells might be available in levels 71 to 80.<br>
Shamans : Totems are being looked at, The Mana Spring totem will be a lot stronger than it is and some other will be made stronger too.<br>
Priests : Fear Ward will be spread around.<br>
Priests (Holy) : Lightwell and other abilities are being looked at.<br>
Paladins (Retribution) : Stat distribution will be changed, spell damage won&apos;t be as much needed as before.<br>

<br>
Stats : Spirit will be improved in WotLK. <br>
<br>
PvP Panel<br>
In AV, players won&apos;t spawn in the cave until there&apos;s nowhere else to spawn. Players will have the ability to report other players for being AFK, like the spam reports. You can remove this debuff by going in combat. If you don&apos;t, you won&apos;t gain any honor.<br>
Honor gain will be more important at the end of a BG to make people stay.<br>
Guild Battlegrounds are considered. <br>
Siege Weapons and destroyable buildings will be in the expansion (Undead Meatwagon throwing corpses, catapult used to attack buildings)<br>
Some arena weapons will have a &quot;rating requirement&quot; in the future. <br>
Lake Wintergrasp - Outdoor PvP focused zone (even on PvE servers) with siege weapons. <br>
They&apos;re considering a &quot;skirmish mode&quot; where you could chose the team you&apos;ll face in Arena.<br>
Some items might be added to Battleground Marks rewards.<br>
Hunter Weapons price might be lowered to reflect the fact that they need a bow and 1h/2h weapons. <br>
Rogue mobility in Arena could be changed. <br>
The Season 3 Paladin Retribution set will have resilience. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Zul&apos;aman loot : [item=35000,en,wh], [item=35001,en,wh]<br>

<br>
Professions &amp; Item Panel<br>
Things we want to do more<br>
Best in slot equipment (Give each profession a very good BoP item)<br>
Create great leveling gear (Including in Northrend from 70 to 80)<br>
Provide what&apos;s missing (Fill itemization gaps with crafts)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Things to Improve<br>
Engineering is gonna get some love<br>
Transmute (Change the 24h cooldown into a daily cooldown)<br>
Discoveries (They will make some easier to get, deviate delight would have been good as a discovery)<br>
Vendor Recipes (will change the camping thing, make it random but not campable)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Inscription<br>
Not Alchemy or Enchanting<br>
Inscribe Spells and Abilities with additional power (Shadow bolt could do more damage, backstab could crit more, etc ...)<br>
Create completely new type of items. (Too early in development to talk about it, but making spells more powerful is just one part of the Inscriptions)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Coming Soon (2.2 and 2.3 Patches)<br>
Professions daily quests<br>
New Crafter-Only gear (more &quot;best in slot&quot; stuff, new jewelcrafter only gems, etc)<br>
Smoothing out the progression (especially between 275 and 300)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
New Enchant: Executioner (Drops in Zul&apos;aman)<br>
Use: Learn how to permanently enchant a Melee Weapon to occasionally ignore 840 of your ennemy&apos;s armor. Requires a level 35 or higher item.<br>
The visual effect will be at least as cool as Mongoose<br>
<br>
New Gems<br>
Shown a few gems that we already listed in this picture (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/newgems.jpg)<br>
<br>
New Cooking Recipes<br>
Melee hit food, spell crit food, storm chops (AoE damage when monsters get near you) <br>
<br>
<br>
World<br>
Dalaran will be moved and hover above Northrend. It will be used as a neutral capital city.<br>
There are more daily quests coming in the next patch-- a dungeon daily quest, a battleground daily quest, and a cooking daily quest.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Instances<br>
A new 25 man dungeon is scheduled for release after Zul&apos;aman, it will have 6 bosses with loots higher than tier 6. Another 5-man instance is also considered. (This will be before the expansion)<br>
There will be a new CoT instance in the expansion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
Heroic badge loot will be added to the game with Zul&apos;Aman<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Are we going to have to buy new flying mounts again? <br>
Laughter. You&apos;ll not &quot;have&quot; to buy a new flying mount, but we&apos;ll have new options available.<br>
<br>
Will green items in Northrend be better than Tier 4? <br>
Yes, we do expect to see the same kind of progression. We were happy overall with the way it worked. If you&apos;re decked out in Illidan gear or the new raid zone that I can&apos;t mention just yet that will be out before the expansion (!), that gear will last you a while. But players like upgrades early and often.<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
New Battleground<br>
Siege vehicles that you can drive around<br>
15 People in each team<br>
30~40 minutes long games.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
New Arena Season<br>
New Season<br>
New Arena<br>
New Gear<br>
<br>
<br>
There will also be a new Outdoor non-instanced world PVP Zone with impact on the whole world. (Even for PVE Servers)<br>
<br>
Classes changes<br>
Shaman talent changes<br>
<br>

<br>
Hero Classes<br>
Hero Classes won&apos;t be released all at once because of balancing issues. They&apos;re classic Warcraft 3 characters with an &quot;epic feel&quot; (something really different than the ordinary)<br>
<br>
The hero class will be created on a new character slot once you completed the quest, you won&apos;t lose your original character.<br>
<br>
&quot;We want to see how the Death Knight works out before talking about new Hero Classes&quot;<br>
<br>
Death Knight<br>
The current plan is to have the class available for all races.<br>
Designed to fullfill both tanking and DPS roles<br>
Can tank using 2H weapons or by Dual-Wielding, no need for shields.<br>
Rather than using rage, energy, or mana, Death Knights have a special &quot;rune sword&quot; displayed beneath their health bar, onto which the player can etch six different runes (choose between Frost, Blood, and Unholy).<br>
Rune resource system. Three rune schools: Blood runes, frost, and unholy runes. All DK spells and abilities will use these different runes in some combo. DKs carve these runes into their weapon-- done anytime outside of combat.<br>
Character portrait has six runes in place of the mana bar (and a special circle around the icon, probably for Hero class). These runes are consume as your spells use them-- they deactivate and then reactivate over time, so if you have two frost and four blood runes, you get that much to use as spells and abilities. We have plans for mechanics that allow you to change one resource type on the fly-- like Warlock&apos;s Life Tap (Health=mana).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Death Knight Skills<br>
Unholy Embrace<br>
Instant Cast. 5 min cooldown.<br>
Target is embraced by a silhouette of darkness for 6 seconds, corrupting any healing spells and effects cast upon or currently affecting the target to cause damage for 50% of their healing potential instead of restoring health. Any damage shields cast upon or currently affecting the target will also be instantly consumed, dealing 50% of their absorption potential in damage. Once afflicted with Unholy Embrace, the target cannot be afflicted with Unholy Embrace again for 1 minute.<br>
<br>
Army of the Dead<br>
Raises several temporary minions (ghouls)</div></div>
