The Armor Showroom is finally updated ! It took a lot of time because the whole code had to be changed, it will be a lot easier to update it, and it shouldn't be a problem for the next patch.

New Features
Screenshots are now direct render from the game, showing a few things that wowmodelviewer http://www.wowmodelviewer.org can't show. A few light effects on some sets like the tier 6 priest 
The page won't "reload" on set change, only if you decide to check another class. This should make the browsing a lot more enjoyable.



Todo list
2.0.1 Today, or tomorrow : Re add the Dungeon Set 3, fix the name of the window. 
2.1.0 A bit later : Use more relevant classes for each set. A human wearing Horde PvP is definitely weird
2.2.0 Much later : Support for all races. 

Website
Yesterday downtime was like a night with me. Not enjoyable for both sides. 
I apologize for the multiple crashes, everything should now be fixed and the tooltips were fixed to change a few things. Icons and tooltip background should be shown properly, and you should have decent tooltip layout on every page now. Please report any bug you may find in comments, thanks

Mage PvP Guide
Tarde mage from SK-Gaming posted a Mage PvP Guide http://www.sk-gaming.com/feature/839/ on their site. It's not going into intensive theorycrafting but it's definitely a good read if you're a mage willing to survive this cruel world.
