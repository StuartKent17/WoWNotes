After years in exile, the Darkspear trolls are preparing to invade the Echo Isles and reclaim the land once bestowed to them by Thrall. Led by Vol&apos;jin, a wise and highly regarded Darkspear, the tribe&apos;s bravest warriors will set out from Orgrimmar and Sen&apos;jin Village, seeking to bring about Zalazane&apos;s fall and begin the process of rebuilding their homes and villages on the Echo Isles. In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, new troll adventurers will begin their journey on these tiny islands off the coast of Durotar, where they&apos;ll be able to experience this time of trial and transition firsthand.<br>
<br>
Though the Darkspears may once again have their land, the tribe&apos;s turmoil is far from over. The impending cataclysm will spark rivalry among the Horde leadership, and after years of running from a seemingly endless string of conflicts to preserve the Darkspear nation, Vol&apos;jin is done fleeing. The Darkspears have reclaimed their islands and have no intention of settling elsewhere. Of course, as an untested member of the tribe, you&apos;ll have some training to do before tackling the Darkspears&apos; larger matters.<br>
<br>
Every great hero starts somewhere. As a troll of the Echo Isles, the journey begins with safeguarding your people&apos;s well-being. Early in your adventures, you&apos;ll be charged with protecting the local Bloodtalon raptors and hatchlings from the sorcery of a nearby sea witch, slaying the beasts that feast upon the Darkspears&apos; primary food sources, and assaulting the naga who&apos;ve overrun the northern isle. But it won&apos;t be long before Vol&apos;jin trusts you with vital -- and potentially dangerous -- information about the political struggles plaguing the Horde and, ultimately, the fellow members of your tribe.<br>
<br>
In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, you&apos;ll face these trials and more in the trolls&apos; new and enhanced introductory questing experience (level 1 to 5). Be steadfast and honorable, and your actions will help usher in a new era of Darkspear perseverance in a time of ultimate peril.<br>
