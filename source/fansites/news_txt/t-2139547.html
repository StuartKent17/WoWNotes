Unholy Death Knight Changes<br>
At the same time as Pestilent Pustules and Runic Corruption changes are on PTR, Unholy should also have increases to Portal to the Underworld damage, Armies of the Damned proc rate, Death Coil damage, and a small increase to all damage.

Patch 7.1.5 Hunter Changes<br>
Still would like to know when these hotfixes are being rolled out so I can test them.<br>
These should be on PTR now.<br>
<br>
We&apos;ll look into the point about Marked Shot being lower damage per Focus than Aimed Shot. Both Marked Shot and Aimed Shot could probably do something closer to their live damage (assuming Patient Sniper/Sidewinders setup) to ensure Marked Shot is always high priority. Lower Focus cost on Marked Shot is also a possibility. Overall, the rotation should remain similar for a player who continues using Patient Sniper and Sidewinders, with the main caveat being that using Sidewinders in all situations will have more downsides than it does in 7.1.

Patch 7.1.5 Windwalker Monk Hotfixes<br>
In addition to some changes that are visible normally in the client (damage of most Windwalker abilities), a recent hotfix included one change that won&apos;t be noticeable until you try it, which is a very large increase to Xuen&apos;s damage.

Elothir is an ancient. (Alex_Afrasiabi (https://twitter.com/Alex_Afrasiabi/status/806888186261577728))<br>
Why is he labeled as a Humanoid and not an Elemental if this is the case?<br>
somebody forgot to set a flag. I will have them flogged, as is our custom. Rules are rules. (Alex_Afrasiabi (https://twitter.com/Alex_Afrasiabi/status/810999052984721409))<br>
