Glowcap Festivalglowcap
Glowcap Festival http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/648-glowcap-festival allows players to help keep Fshoo http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/118509-fshoo alive in Sporeggar to earn reputation. 


Head to Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh to take part in this holiday. 
Mushrooms will spawn around the town, giving you Glowcap http://www.wowdb.com/items/24245-glowcap and other helpful items:

Sack of Healing Spores http://www.wowdb.com/items/144276-sack-of-healing-spores - Channeled heal for Fshoo.
Sporeggium http://www.wowdb.com/items/144261-sporeggium - 2% healing buff per stack. Stacks to 100 times. 
Rimecap http://www.wowdb.com/items/144265-rimecap - Stop all damage and growth for 3 seconds, allowing healers to catch up.
Fungal Lifestalk http://www.wowdb.com/items/144262-fungal-lifestalk - Instant 5% heal for Fshoo.

You can purchase all four of the items above from Mycah http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/18382-mycah, the Sporeggar Quartermaster.
You can also loot a Pungent Truffle http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235264-pungent-truffle, allowing you to transform into a sporeling for 24 hours.
Fshoo spawns periodically, gaining stacks of Fshoo Grow http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235202-fshoo-grow. Each stack increases his size by 1% and health by 100%. 
Fshoo also loses health at a constant rate, making him harder and harder to heal as the grow stacks appear. 
Using the items and healing him to keep him alive as long as possible is the objective.
When Fshoo dies he will give everyone 50 Sporeggar reputation for every stack of the buff he had.
