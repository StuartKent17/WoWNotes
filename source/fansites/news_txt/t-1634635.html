Blizzard has been posting hourly updates on steps they are taking to improve stability and reduce queues. Recent updates include:<br>
<br>
<br>
US and EU maintenance was completed and added capacity by phasing all of Draenor and upgrading server hardware. <br>
Realm population caps were raised to normal levels in the US and EU once again.<br>
Realm population caps were then increased above the old normal capacity in the US, with testing of the same solution coming to the EU soon.<br>
<br>
<br>
4:00 p.m. PST<br>
All North American and Oceanic realms have now had their population caps increased. We are continuing to monitor realm stability, and plan to begin testing the increase on European realms soon. In addition, we&#x2019;re making progress towards correcting an issue that would occasionally cause players to get stuck on flight paths when flying to their Garrison. Our next update will occur in roughly one hour.<br>
<br>
3:00 p.m. PST<br>
Our initial tests to increase realm capacity were successful, so we&#x2019;ve continued to roll out our testing of increased population caps to additional North American and Oceanic realms. We&#x2019;re also making steady progress to resolve the issues causing instance, world, and Garrison server crashes in Europe. We&#x2019;ll provide another update approximately one hour from now.<br>
<br>
2:10 p.m. PST<br>
After carefully monitoring server performance for the last few hours, we are now testing raising realm capacity above normal population caps. We&#x2019;re going to temporarily increase the population cap on a few realms in North America, and observe them closely. Our next update will be in approximately an hour.<br>
<br>
1:00 p.m. PST<br>
We are continuing to optimize servers and address additional performance issues. Realms appear stable with the increased population caps. We are monitoring server stability as Europe continues through peak play time and populations increase in the Americas. We&#x2019;ll provide further updates in approximately one hour.<br>
<br>
12:00 p.m. PST<br>
As previously posted, both Europe and the Americas/Oceanic realms went into an off-peak maintenance to upgrade realm hardware, and implement a new Draenor-wide instancing tech to improve game performance. Both regions&#x2019; maintenances concluded successfully, and so far we&#x2019;ve seen very positive results, allowing us to dramatically raise the realm population caps for all realms. We&#x2019;re going to continue optimizing the in-game experience, focus on the new instancing tech, and hotfix gameplay issues as they come up.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re currently seeing a very high demand on the game and game services due to the exceptionally large number of people excited to play Warlords of Draenor. We&#x2019;re focusing on a few specific issues, one of which is a group of realms in Europe that are seeing increased instance, world, and Garrison server crashes. That&#x2019;s being addressed as an isolated issue and we&#x2019;re investigating the cause to ensure it doesn&#x2019;t occur elsewhere.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll be looking into the possibility of Free Character Transfers for our highest population realms, but first we need to get the service to a place where we feel it&#x2019;s also able to process a potentially large number of transfers while not adversely affecting service stability.<br>
<br>
Our next steps are to continue working on the few performance issues we&#x2019;re tracking in Europe, and continue maintaining and improving the level of service in the Americas and Oceania. We&#x2019;ll provide another update in an hour.<br>
<br>
11:00 a.m. PST<br>
We&#x2019;re working to mitigate some localized instance and Garrison server crashes in Europe. We&#x2019;re still seeing what we would expect to see in the Americas/Oceanic region for high queues on very populace realms, and for Europe there are queues across the majority of realms during their peak play time. We&#x2019;ll provide a more comprehensive update in an hour on where the service currently stands as a whole, and what else we&#x2019;re working on.<br>
<br>
10:00 a.m. PST<br>
We&#x2019;re continuing to monitor the realms post-maintenance. Realms are being maintained at their raised population caps, and while many realms no longer have queues, we do expect that high population realms will still see a wait to log in. We&#x2019;ll continue to provide updates throughout the day.<br>
<br>
9:00 a.m. PST<br>
We&#x2019;re continuing to monitor realms and track any individual issues as they occur. We&#x2019;re still seeing some issues occurring now that Europe is in their peak playtime, but with greatly reduced frequency compared to before maintenance.<br>
<br>
All realms are now set back up to their normal population caps. Queues being experienced now are due to demand beyond what the realms are normally capable of handling, and we&#x2019;ll be looking into how to reduce them further.<br>
<br>
8:02 a.m. PST<br>
All Americas and Oceanic realms are live. We are continuing to monitor these realms for reports of any ongoing stability issues.<br>
<br>
The EU website and forums issues are being investigated as are reports of &quot;World Server Down&quot; issues and Garrison accessibility.<br>

<br>
Across our EU realms, we&apos;re monitoring reports of scattered stability issues and have been performing restarts to pick up hotfixes.<br>
<br>
We continue to deploy hotfixes for specific gameplay issues through the night. These are often fixes for quests that are not working correctly or not completing, as well as unexpected behavior of various game elements.<br>
