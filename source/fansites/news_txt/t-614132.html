Two news for the price of one today, we&apos;re updating with a few information about upcoming changes for Shamans and Warlocks !<br>
New beam graphics<br>
Also as a side note Mind Flay is getting an upgraded beam graphic! (Warlocks will be getting all new beams too, including Chain Heal for Shamans) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/9679739074-spriest-dps-impression-at-l80.html))<br>

Shadow Power changes<br>
Still some work to do. We&apos;re going to be changing Shadow Power to 100% bonus crit damage to be consistent with other classes, also doing some other tweaks. We have a bit more work to do with all classes DPS numbers. <br>

Spectral Transformation replaced<br>
We&apos;re going to be dumping Spectral Transformation. We decided we weren&apos;t cool with the Shaman&apos;s Ghost Wolf being too close to a core Druid iconic ability. What will replace it is a deep Enhancement Talent that will cause your Earthbind totem to clear all snares each time it pulses on you and all nearby friendly targets.

<br>
Shaman DPS a lot lower than expected<br>
A lot of tuning still has to be done, but it&apos;s safe to say your DPS is a lot lower than what should be expected. All DPS classes/specs after we are done tuning should yield a pretty similar DPS with similar gear/&quot;min/max&quot; speccing. It&apos;s going to take a bit of time until we reach that goal, though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/9679909495-feelings-on-shamans-after-completing-naxx25.html))<br>
<br>
Maelstrom Weapons changes<br>
We will have it proc from Windfury soon. Also we&apos;re going to allow it to also allow you to cast heals with Maelstrom procs (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/9679752093-maelstorm-weapon.html))<br>

Corruption - Base instant cast<br>
We&apos;re going to make Corruption base instant cast. The Improved Corruption talent will now increase Corruption&apos;s damage by 4/8/12/16/20%. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/9679892704-improved-corruption.html))<br>
<br>
Ruin and Devastation changes<br>
In an upcoming build we are changing Ruin to a 5-point talent. However, it will swap places with Devastation. Devastation will become a 1-point talent (5% spell crit). This will be a minimal change to the Destruction Warlock, while opening up Ruin to other builds without having them sacrifice their 51-point talents. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/9679802649-aff-haunt-vs-ruin.html))<br>
<br>
Metamorphosis changes - details<br>
We recently re-designed Metamorphosis for an upcoming build. Some changes:<br>
<br>
- It will no longer remove your pet (your pet remains)<br>
- It increases your armor by 600%, up from 360%<br>
- It increases all your damage by 40%<br>
- You can still cast your regular Warlock spells<br>
- You gain access two a few new unique Demon Form abilities that can only be used in Demon Form<br>
<br>
Among some other improvements. It will be changed back to a 5-minute cooldown, however (with a 45 second duration). With the changes to Ruin, you can also get Metamorphosis and Ruin in a build if you wish. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/9679801199-mirror-image--metamorphosis.html))<br>
<br>
Pandemic<br>
Going to be changing the visual and some other aspects of the talent soon, not going to have the Shadow Bolt graphic (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/9679630560-pandemic--not-currently-working.html))</div></div>
