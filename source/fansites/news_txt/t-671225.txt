Abyssal Shatter Hotfixed to Live Servers!
A very interesting change was hotfixed to live servers today, Enchanting: Abyssal Shatter  is now available from your local Enchanting Trainer!!


 

I won't try to link it to my enchanting AH guide released 2 days ago it's all a conspiracy against me, I know it! and I will post the results I got from a few shatters I did on live servers.
