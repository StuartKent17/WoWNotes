Azeroth’s keepers use seeds of the ancients to nourish and revitalize the flame-scarred slopes surrounding Mount Hyjal—but this isn’t the only region left scarred by the Cataclysm. The Cenarion Circle seeks worthy champions to spread regrowth across the land by tending to a Blossoming Ancient, a sign of seasonal rebirth.

As each new season begins, this traveling tree changes, bringing new life to its surroundings. Go to the Blizzard Store  now to adopt one of these spirited saplings.

Once activated, this in-game pet key applies to all present and future World of Warcraft® characters on a single Battle.net® account.
