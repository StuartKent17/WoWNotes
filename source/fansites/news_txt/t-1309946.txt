Azeroth’s keepers use seeds of the ancients to nourish and revitalize the flame-scarred slopes surrounding Mount Hyjal—but this isn’t the only region left scarred by the Cataclysm. The Cenarion Circle seeks worthy champions to spread regrowth across the land by tending to a Blossoming Ancient, a sign of seasonal rebirth.

As each new season begins, this traveling tree changes, bringing new life to its surroundings. Go to the Blizzard Store http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=1100002618 now to adopt one of these spirited saplings.

Once activated, this in-game pet key applies to all present and future World of Warcraft® characters on a single Battle.net® account.
