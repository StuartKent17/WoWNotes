Patch 8.2.5 - More War Campaign Conclusion Cutscenes<br>
The Battle for Azeroth War Campaign conclusion had two other in-game cutscenes (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8752-The-War-Campaign-Finale-Cinematics) that take place after the two main ones covered the other day. The first one below is the final scene for Alliance characters and Saurfang supporters. The second one is the scene you see if you remained a Sylvanas loyalist. Thanks to the Youtube Supreme IRM (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvSSvH63TCzCYGJeveVOKnQ) for the scenes! SPOILERS AHEAD!<br>
