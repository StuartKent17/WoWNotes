Boubouille2010-10-03, 07:25 AMPatch 4.0.1 - PTR Build 13131
The test realms have been updated with a new PTR build, this build is tagged as Release and seems to be a release candidate for live servers, it's a very small patch with only a few changes to spell data. You can still expect the patch on October 5th or 12th as far as I'm concerned.

Achievements Changes
A couple of beta achievements have been updated and some of the "old" achievements have been reverted to fit the 4.0.1 environment you have to kill Thrall in Orgrimmar instead of Garrosh, etc .... Blizzard is definitely polishing for live release.
