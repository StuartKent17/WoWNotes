Boubouille2010-10-03, 07:25 AMPatch 4.0.1 - PTR Build 13131
The test realms have been updated with a new PTR build, this build is tagged as Release and seems to be a release candidate for live servers, it's a very small patch with only a few changes to spell data. You can still expect the patch on October 5th or 12th as far as I'm concerned.




Achievements Changes
A couple of beta achievements have been updated and some of the "old" achievements have been reverted to fit the 4.0.1 environment you have to kill Thrall in Orgrimmar instead of Garrosh, etc .... Blizzard is definitely polishing for live release. 
Guild Achievements - Raids & Dungeons

Call of the Crusade - Guild Edition  now requires you to defeat every boss in ToC Heroic instead of just Anub'arak. 


Raids & Dungeons

Crushing Bones and Cracking Skulls  now requires you to kill 3 Angered Earth elementals, down from 10.
Arrested Development  now requires you to kill Corla before any Zealot becomes evolved.
Don't Need to Break Eggs to Make an Omelet  now requires you to kill Erudax without letting a Faceless Corruptor hatch.
Heroic: Omnitron Council  is now named the Golem Council. 


General

The Keymaster  - Obtain the keys listed below.


Quests

Don't Want No Zombies on My Lawn  now requires you to survive 25 waves, up from 15.
Bloom and Doom  is now a Feat of Strength




Spell Changes
This is a 4.0.1 build and beta is 4.0.3, I strongly suggest that you do not consider these changes as upcoming beta changes, they might be 4.0.1 only. A couple of changes from the latest beta build have been reverted
