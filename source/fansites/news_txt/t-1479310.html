It appears EU might have to wait a few days (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/446012817129226240), but this is live in the US now.<br>
We&#x2019;ve recently implemented an often requested feature to enable cross-realm raiding for Siege of Orgrimmar. Cross-realm BattleTag&#x2122; and Real ID friends can now raid together and take the fight to Garrosh on Normal or Heroic difficulty. Players will be able to earn greater rewards such as Reins of the Kor&apos;kron War Wolf (http://www.wowdb.com/items/104246-reins-of-the-korkron-war-wolf) or the title of Conqueror (http://www.wowdb.com/titles/382-conqueror-of-orgrimmar)/Liberator (http://www.wowdb.com/titles/383-liberator-of-orgrimmar) of Orgrimmar; both of which aren&#x2019;t available to be earned within Flexible or Raid Finder difficulty.<br>
<br>
This change is currently live.<br>
<br>
This is a change very late into a tier, which leads me to believe that when WoD comes out this change won&apos;t be live and will still require guilds on the same server to tackle Mythic raiding.<br>
Correct -- current-tier Mythic raiding in Warlords will still be limited to players from a single server. In the meantime, though, this change may help guilds that are trying to recruit and grow in preparation for Mythic raiding.<br>
<br>
As for realm firsts, realm firsts are guild achievements; you need to be in a guild group, which is by definition 8/10 or 20/25 members coming from a single guild on a single server. You could theoretically have a couple of guests from a different server and still claim the realm first, but ultimately 80% of the group still has to be from the same guild.</div></div>
