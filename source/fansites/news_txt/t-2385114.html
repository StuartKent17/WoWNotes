Dungeon and Raids<br>
<br>
With maintenance in each region, Mythic difficulty Antorus, the Burning Throne is now available for cross realm groups.<br>
Hounds of Sargeras<br>
Resolved an issue which could sometimes cause Shadowscar to move a player out of the bounds of the playspace.<br>
<br>
Events<br>
Fixed an issue that could cause in-game holidays to start or finish up to an hour early or late on the Australian realms. This also resolves an issue where the Stranglethorn Vale fishing tournament was inaccessible in Australia.<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: This may cause some events to shift in the calendar slightly for Australian players. Please check the in-game calendar for updated local times.<br>

Jump into PvP Brawls: Deep Six<br>
Who has your six in this six vs. six brawl? Deep Six will put you and your group to the test.<br>
<br>
Every other week, a new PvP Brawl will be available to players looking for something just a little different. Each Brawl will offer a variety of modes, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay, and you&#x2019;ll find them in the Group Finder tool (hotkey &#x201C;I&#x201D;) in the Player vs. Player tab. Just like Random Battlegrounds, you&#x2019;ll receive a reward for achieving victory.<br>
<br>
Deep Six pits teams of six players against each other in three iconic Battlegrounds: Warsong Gulch, Silvershard Mines, and Temple of Kotmogu. Each Battleground offers a little variation on the traditional format, such as flags that are a bit closer in Warsong Gulch, less carts to keep track of in Silvershard Mines, and only two orbs within the Temple of Kotmogu.</div></div>
