Magtheridon got nerfed too. Didn&apos;t take long.<br>
<br>
The Magtheridon encounter has been rebalanced to be somewhat easier and should now better keep to proper raid progression.<br>

Karazhan got its share too.<br>
<br>
Nightbane&apos;s melee damage has been reduced.<br>
Nightbane&apos;s breath attack and rain of bones now target those players attempting to avoid his attacks.<br>
The Romulo and Julianne encounter has been retuned to be less difficult. <br>

Also a note about Magtheridon<br>
<br>
<br>
We still plan to look into improving the Magtheridon encounter, but no adjustments have been put into motion yet.<br>
<br>
As a reminder, Hydross got nerfed too<br>
<br>
Hydross the Unstable no longer deals a crushing blow. <br>
