In anticipation of the upcoming 25th anniversary of Warcraft, we’ve partnered with GOG.COM to rerelease the real-time strategy classics that started it all—Warcraft: Orcs & Humans and Warcraft II Battle.net Edition, including both the original Tides of Darkness and the Beyond the Dark Portal expansion. Starting today, players can once again explore these universe-defining games as they become available digitally and DRM-free for the first time ever, exclusively on GOG.COM https://www.gog.com/game/warcraft_bundle?utm_source=blizzard.com&utm_medium=legacy&utm_campaign=warcraft-blizz!

Warcraft: Orcs & Humans takes players back to the original battle for Azeroth, challenging players to pick a side and raise an army of humans or orcs capable of bringing ruin to their enemies. Warcraft II and its expansion take the battle to the high seas with a host of naval units, and introduces more of the races that make up the Alliance and the Horde, bolstering the human and orc forces with elves, trolls, dwarves, and more.
