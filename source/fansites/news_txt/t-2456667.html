Patch 8.1 - Elite PvP Titles and Queue Times<br>
Patch 8.1 added new elite titles (https://www.wowdb.com/titles?filter-search=elite) rewarded from PvP.<br>
High PvP Queue Times<br>
We&apos;ve noticed this increase in queue times as well, particularly for highly-rated players. We&apos;re currently investigating to find a fix, but this was not intended. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1074846320186208256))<br>
<br>
PvP Titles<br>
the PvP title NAME the Elite CLASS, added in 8.1 will this title only last for the season, or is a title for keeps, once its earned for said character/characters of said class?<br>
Elite titles are only active during the season in which they are earned. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1074826864235958272))<br>

Don Your Holiday Apparel&#x2014;The Feast of Winter Veil Has Begun!<br>
The fine folks of Smokywood Pastures aren&#x2019;t letting a little thing like war between the Horde and the Alliance get in the way of spreading holiday cheer&#x2014;or gaining a bit of profit. Winter Veil has begun in Azeroth, and with it come all the fripperies, fineries, and delectable comestibles of the holiday.<br>
<br>
When: December 16 &#x2013; January 2<br>
Where: Initial holiday quests can be found in Orgrimmar and Ironforge, but festive decorations can be found throughout the world.<br>
<br>
Let your spirit be light by stepping into one of the Giant Snow Globes* found outside of the Ironforge Bank, in Orgrimmar overlooking the Valley of Wisdom, or in the Broken Isles in Dalaran. It&#x2019;s a truly transformative experience letting your inner Greatfather Winter helper out. A little /dance will spread the joy to those around you.<br>

<br>
<br>
The Abominable Greench is (still) a mean one, but we&#x2019;re sure that once you&#x2019;ve filled up on the fine foods and beverages from Smokywood Pastures, you&#x2019;re bound to put a stop to his reign of terror in the Hillsbrad Foothills. The quest You&#x2019;re a Mean One&#x2026; is now available to players level 60 and up.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of holiday hats to be found on a variety of bosses from dungeons in the Broken Isles, Northrend, and more. You just need to decide which color hat you want. Will it be green or red?<br>
<br>
*May experience some shrinkage with use<br>
**Please /dance responsibly. Side effects include joy and laughter. Wait at least 30 minutes after eating Smokywood Pastures fine festive foods to avoid unpleasant side effects.<br>
