Blizzcon 2015 - North American Arena Qualifiers

PvP Gear and Champion's Strongbox
All that being said, we agree that it’s not ideal for the only methods of earning that gear to be Ashran or Rated BGs. I can’t make any promises, but we’re exploring some options to make it available through other forms of PvP. Just keep in mind that we do want there to be some extra incentive to participate in RBGs and Ashran.
To follow up on this, we're planning to allow the Champion's Strongbox  to be purchased from Conquest vendors for 1500 Conquest Points once a player has earned the Wild Conquest 27k achievement. It will be added to the vendors in an upcoming hotfix.

Even with Strongboxes being purchasable, it still includes RNG which is what people are opposed to. Are you even listening to us??
Believe me, I completely understand how frustrating it is to get the "wrong" item. I've gotten two pairs of Vers/Mastery pants from Ashran. Would I have liked to get something else this week? Absolutely. But I also know that, especially this early on, being 1 item behind at worst someone else isn't going to have much of an effect on my standings at the end of the season.

Ultimately, we'd love to find a system that brings all the benefits of RNG gearing which I talked about earlier in the thread but doesn't have the frustration of duplicate items or the fear of never getting your best pieces. Buying pieces directly for Conquest points is not that system. We'll continue to look into other options, though.

hey, i am getting only two stacks of Elusive Brew with my 2hand weapon on my brewmaster. Is it an intended changed ?
Nothing changed here. You likely switched to a fast 2H weapon. You only get guaranteed 3 stacks with a 3.6-speed weapon. WarcraftDevs 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Is it intentional that Mind Flay doesnt proc Prophecy Of Fear AOE but Arcane Missles does?
Yes because Mind Flay is a damage-over-time ability. WarcraftDevs 

Character / Items
The change to Fragment of Dark Star  is additive or multiplicative? 25% or 41% final effect.
Multiplicative. It’d be 25% at Heroic ilvl. WarcraftDevs 

- Hunter's Seeking Crystal goes on cooldown even if it fails to teleport you to a rare, intended or oversight?
This is intended. WarcraftDevs 

w/ caches now not giving "next difficulty" gear after X kills, wont they become obsolete as we gear up through the tier?
Better for raiding to make mission rewards obsolete, than for missions to make raiding rewards obsolete. WarcraftDevs 

Will the Throbbing Blood Orb be a toy too when the mini-patch that turns the Cursed Feather of Ikzan into one?
Yes. WarcraftDevs 

What is the reason behind the 50% nerf of Discordant Chorus' proc? It's already weaker than Empty Drinking Horn.
You might be comparing them to unfavorable situations, such as on a single-target. Fel Cleave was quite powerful. WarcraftDevs 

PvE
How does Supreme Lord Kazzak ilvl loot work? Is it based on your progression in HFC or just a tooltip error in journal?
This is a dungeon journal bug and will be corrected in a future patch. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
any plans to fix ashram queue spending half my day in a queue isn't fun
The queue is a big problem. We acknowledge that. Fixing it is difficult. We are working on options. holinka 

Will the class trinkets from HfC work in PvP?
They do not work in rated PvP. WarcraftDevs 

Lore
What are voidwalkers? Are they void-corrupted spirits like voidwraiths?
Not defined, atm. Maybe someday we will visit the cool-ass void dimension Muffinus 

Reputation / Questing
Why do we have to do one apexis daily, to come back & pick up 2 more? Why not offer them in one go? Clarification?
The initial quest gives the most reputation; the follow-ups are there for those who want to invest more time. WarcraftDevs 

Garrisons
What happened to the Garrison Mage Tower in 6.2? The Amperial Construct have gone all buggy and doesn't work 100% of the time
1 There was a bug where players would fall through the world, so some pathing logic was added. WarcraftDevs 
2 This isn’t an ideal solution, so Amperial Construct will teleport you instantly in a small future patch. WarcraftDevs 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs  appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Developer Communication
What are the lessons learned under the one voice of & multiple voice of now? How to improve going forward? #WarlordsQA
I think multiple voices are always better but one is better than none. OccupyGStreet 

Remember when he basically told the player base they had to play better? Or nerfing paladins to the ground?
To be clear, I did encourage players to take dungeon strategy more seriously. That wasn't sarcasm. OccupyGStreet 
If you refer to the origin of the "to the ground" meme I was apologizing to players for not announcing a nerf. OccupyGStreet 
And I hadn't announced the nerf because I was on vacation. I wrote "to the ground" at a vineyard. OccupyGStreet 
Anyway, extreme sarcasm is probably a defense mechanism of mine. OccupyGStreet 
But I like that sarcasm helps convey that I don't take myself too seriously. OccupyGStreet 
It's rough on non-English speakers though. Chinese journalists had me raise my hand when I was being sarcastic. OccupyGStreet 
Because for them this shit is SO FREAKING SERIOUS. They forget that even great games are activities of leisure. OccupyGStreet 
For me, most importantly, multiplayer games are about hanging out with friends. OccupyGStreet 

Sure, not all players would vote, but a good bunch would, which should be very valuable data on said subject.
A public poll has many problems but targeted queries can be very effective. We use them. OccupyGStreet 
Curious what kind of problems. I think that presetting the proper expectations for it to the players would solve most of them
It's not a random sampling, potential for influence, potential for fraud off the top of my head. OccupyGStreet 

Game Design
Players micromanaging dev teams is obv silly. But concerns over individual leads seem... less silly.
It's still really hard for players on the outside to reverse engineer which lead led to which change. OccupyGStreet 
That's why I always advise players to just stick with the change itself. OccupyGStreet
