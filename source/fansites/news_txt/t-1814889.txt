Ships

Raids and Dungeons

Adjusted scaling to reduce the amount of health by roughly 10% on some Hellfire Reinforcements and some Felfire-Imbued Siege Vehicles for a 10-player raid on Heroic difficulty. Health should remain the same as before for raids with 30 players.

Hellfire Reinforcements: Contracted Engineer, Gorebound Felcasters, Iron Dragoon, Hulking Berserker
Felfire-Imbued Siege Vehicles: Felfire Artillery, Felfire Crusher, Felfire Demolisher, Felfire Flamebelcher

Mannoroth

Mannoroth should now have a chance to target Hunters with Shadowforce.
Mannoroth should no longer use Shadowforce on players already affected by Mark of Doom.

Archimonde

Doomfire now persists for 120 seconds up from 90.


PvP
Ashran

Fixed an issue where players that have died during an event may sometimes not receive quest credit after their faction wins the event.

Blizzcon 2015 - North American Arena Qualifiers
GCDTV http://www.twitch.tv/gcdtv is holding the North American Blizzcon arena qualifier rounds in July and August to determine which teams will be going to Blizzcon.

PvP Gear and Champion's Strongbox
All that being said, we agree that it’s not ideal for the only methods of earning that gear to be Ashran or Rated BGs. I can’t make any promises, but we’re exploring some options to make it available through other forms of PvP. Just keep in mind that we do want there to be some extra incentive to participate in RBGs and Ashran.
To follow up on this, we're planning to allow the Champion's Strongbox http://www.wowdb.com/items/126920-champions-strongbox to be purchased from Conquest vendors for 1500 Conquest Points once a player has earned the Wild Conquest 27k achievement. It will be added to the vendors in an upcoming hotfix.

Even with Strongboxes being purchasable, it still includes RNG which is what people are opposed to. Are you even listening to us??
Believe me, I completely understand how frustrating it is to get the "wrong" item. I've gotten two pairs of Vers/Mastery pants from Ashran. Would I have liked to get something else this week? Absolutely. But I also know that, especially this early on, being 1 item behind at worst someone else isn't going to have much of an effect on my standings at the end of the season.

Ultimately, we'd love to find a system that brings all the benefits of RNG gearing which I talked about earlier in the thread but doesn't have the frustration of duplicate items or the fear of never getting your best pieces. Buying pieces directly for Conquest points is not that system. We'll continue to look into other options, though.

hey, i am getting only two stacks of Elusive Brew with my 2hand weapon on my brewmaster. Is it an intended changed ?
Nothing changed here. You likely switched to a fast 2H weapon. You only get guaranteed 3 stacks with a 3.6-speed weapon. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616054077034663936

Is it intentional that Mind Flay doesnt proc Prophecy Of Fear AOE but Arcane Missles does?
Yes because Mind Flay is a damage-over-time ability. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616361542439714816

Character / Items
The change to Fragment of Dark Star http://www.wowdb.com/items/124522-fragment-of-the-dark-star?bonusIDs=566 is additive or multiplicative? 25% or 41% final effect.
Multiplicative. It’d be 25% at Heroic ilvl. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616053898994782208

- Hunter's Seeking Crystal goes on cooldown even if it fails to teleport you to a rare, intended or oversight?
This is intended. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616054656112824320

w/ caches now not giving "next difficulty" gear after X kills, wont they become obsolete as we gear up through the tier?
Better for raiding to make mission rewards obsolete, than for missions to make raiding rewards obsolete. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616054736425320448

Will the Throbbing Blood Orb be a toy too when the mini-patch that turns the Cursed Feather of Ikzan into one?
Yes. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616334857963081728

What is the reason behind the 50% nerf of Discordant Chorus' proc? It's already weaker than Empty Drinking Horn.
You might be comparing them to unfavorable situations, such as on a single-target. Fel Cleave was quite powerful. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616364192933679104

PvE
How does Supreme Lord Kazzak ilvl loot work? Is it based on your progression in HFC or just a tooltip error in journal?
This is a dungeon journal bug and will be corrected in a future patch. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616350160482799616

PvP
any plans to fix ashram queue spending half my day in a queue isn't fun
The queue is a big problem. We acknowledge that. Fixing it is difficult. We are working on options. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/616309716327788544

Will the class trinkets from HfC work in PvP?
They do not work in rated PvP. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616333181713690624

Lore
What are voidwalkers? Are they void-corrupted spirits like voidwraiths?
Not defined, atm. Maybe someday we will visit the cool-ass void dimension Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/616133464606273537

Reputation / Questing
Why do we have to do one apexis daily, to come back & pick up 2 more? Why not offer them in one go? Clarification?
The initial quest gives the most reputation; the follow-ups are there for those who want to invest more time. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616372336946626560

Garrisons
What happened to the Garrison Mage Tower in 6.2? The Amperial Construct have gone all buggy and doesn't work 100% of the time
1 There was a bug where players would fall through the world, so some pathing logic was added. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616349581656195072
2 This isn’t an ideal solution, so Amperial Construct will teleport you instantly in a small future patch. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616349642389762048


Ghostcrawler Tweets
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Developer Communication
What are the lessons learned under the one voice of & multiple voice of now? How to improve going forward? #WarlordsQA
I think multiple voices are always better but one is better than none. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/609819087758163968

Remember when he basically told the player base they had to play better? Or nerfing paladins to the ground?
To be clear, I did encourage players to take dungeon strategy more seriously. That wasn't sarcasm. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610131110341677056
If you refer to the origin of the "to the ground" meme I was apologizing to players for not announcing a nerf. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610131404156829696
And I hadn't announced the nerf because I was on vacation. I wrote "to the ground" at a vineyard. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610131597086449664
Anyway, extreme sarcasm is probably a defense mechanism of mine. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610132914718662656
But I like that sarcasm helps convey that I don't take myself too seriously. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610133072516808705
It's rough on non-English speakers though. Chinese journalists had me raise my hand when I was being sarcastic. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610133245133369344
Because for them this shit is SO FREAKING SERIOUS. They forget that even great games are activities of leisure. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610133994559029248
For me, most importantly, multiplayer games are about hanging out with friends. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610134193717153792

Sure, not all players would vote, but a good bunch would, which should be very valuable data on said subject.
A public poll has many problems but targeted queries can be very effective. We use them. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/609819384450711553
Curious what kind of problems. I think that presetting the proper expectations for it to the players would solve most of them
It's not a random sampling, potential for influence, potential for fraud off the top of my head. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610203607099510784

Game Design
Players micromanaging dev teams is obv silly. But concerns over individual leads seem... less silly.
It's still really hard for players on the outside to reverse engineer which lead led to which change. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/609515091281645568
That's why I always advise players to just stick with the change itself. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/609515158734438400
