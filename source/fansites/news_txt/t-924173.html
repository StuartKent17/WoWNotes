Battle.net Authenticator Changes<br>
If you use an authenticator &#x2013; and we hope you do &#x2013; you may soon notice that an authenticator prompt may not appear with every login. We&#x2019;ve recently updated our authentication system to intelligently track your login locations, and if you&#x2019;re logging in consistently from the same place, you may not be asked for an authenticator code. This change is being made to make the authenticator process less intrusive when we&#x2019;re sure the person logging in to your account is you.<br>
<br>
We hope to continue improving the authenticator system to ensure the same or greater security, while improving and adding features to make having one a more user friendly experience. If you don&#x2019;t already have a Battle.net Authenticator attached to your account, don&#x2019;t wait until it&#x2019;s too late - http://us.battle.net/en/security/checklist</div></div>
