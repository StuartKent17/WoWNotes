Ulduar Hard Mode Encounters Hotfixed
That's interesting, Blizzard spent the last years releasing new dungeons and nerfing them after some time but we didn't see them buffing a lot of encounters in the past. It looks like they didn't want people to beat the hard modes so fast and a lot of them are getting buffed, including Freya, Thorim, and General Vezax. The Hall of Fame  will be cleared for these bosses. 
4/17/09
Totem of the Dancing Flame should no longer cause a target affected by Stormstrike to take additional damage.
Maim should no longer be removable with Berserker Rage.
Piercing Shots will now cause the correct amount of damage against shielded targets.
The healing a Death Knight receives from damage done by Death Strike has been reduced.
Earthen Power will now properly be applied on the first pulse of an Earthbind Totem.
The paladin ability Vengeance can no longer be spellstolen.
The Twilight Whelps on the Sartharion encounter will now properly come outside of the twilight realm.

Ulduar
Several changes to the Razorscale encounter have been made including the range and damage of the Dark Rune Watcher’s Chain Lightning being reduced, and the radius of Razorscale’s Devouring Flame being slightly reduced.
To increase the challenge, Hodir’s hard mode should need to be completed faster than before and the bonus of the Moonlight buff that NPCs provide to players should be decreased.
The damage done by Thorim and Sif in hard mode has been increased in multiple ways.
Freya has had her health and damage increased in hard mode in multiple ways.
The Ignis the Furnace encounter has received several changes. To make his individual hits less devastating, we reduced his overall melee damage by about 15% but he swings faster now. In normal mode we increased the cooldown of Activate Construct from 30 to 40 seconds. We also decreased the damage of the Scorch ground effect by 20% on both difficulties.
XT-002 Deconstructor’s health and damage has been slightly increased in hard mode.
XT-002 Deconstructor will no longer cast Light Bomb or Gravity Bomb while channeling Tympanic Tantrum.
For the trash leading up to Ignis the Furnace Master, the Magma Rager’s Superheated Winds have had their speed reduced. The normal mode Molten Colossus have had the cooldown of Pyroblast increased.
The trash mobs leading to Mimiron can now see through stealth/invisible, no more sneaking past.
In the General Vezax encounter on hard mode, the Saronite Animus’s Profound Darkness will now hit harder.
Ignis the Furnace Master should no longer melee players he is grabbing.

 Death Strike Healing Nerf
We hotfixed a change to the amount of healing provided by Death Strike.

Originally, this ability was something you would use only situationally to heal yourself at a cost of damage. Since then we have redesigned the death knight class sufficiently to where Death Strike was a major rotational ability for Blood. Given how much the attack is hitting for, we think the amount of healing it provided was too much.

Healing still scales based on diseases and the damage is unchanged. Blood retains its other tools to heal. 

Armor Penetration Mechanics
Ghostcrawler is being very nice and posted the exact formulas for the calculation of Armor Penetration Rating. It doesn't happen very often and I'm sure it will make a few theorycrafters VERY happy. 
Okay, here is a fairly technical explanation we put together for how armor pen works.

We didn’t want Armor Penetration Rating to be too powerful against low armor targets, like it had been in BC. We also didn’t want Armor Penetration Rating to be too powerful against high armor targets.

So, we decided on a system where there is a cap on how much armor the Armor Penetration Rating can be applied to. So, the first X armor on the target is reduced by the percentage listed in the Armor Penetration Rating tooltip, and all armor past that X is unaffected. Another way of understanding that is we multiply the percentage in the tooltip times the minimum of the two values: the cap, and the amount of armor on the target after all other modifiers.

Computing the cap is a little tricky unless you are already familiar with how World of Warcraft armor works. There is an armor constant we’ll call C. C is derived as follows in some pseudocode:

If level<60
C=400+85*targetlevel
Else
C=400+85*targetlevel+4.5*85*targetlevel-59;

For a level 80 target, C=15232.5. For a level 83, C=16635.

The cap for Armor Penetration then is: armor + C/3.

A level 80 warrior creature has 9729 armor. C=15232.5. So, the cap is 9729+15232.5/3=8320.5. Let’s say a player has 30% armor penetration from armor penetration rating and no other modifiers that complicate the calculation talents, Battle Stance, Sunder Armor, etc.. The game chooses the minimum of 8320.5 and 9729, so 8320.5. That is multiplied by 30% = 2496.15, and so that much armor is ignored. The effective armor on the target is 7232.85 9729-2496.15. From a player point of view, the armor penetration rating didn’t ignore the full 30%, but instead ignored 25.66%. 85.5% as effective as expected.

These equations should help you be able to test and verify that Armor Penetration Rating is working correctly and as we designed. The tooltip is not actually inaccurate, as it states: “Enemy armor reduced by up to 30.00%.” That "up to" is key.

Please be sure to test without any other effects which modify the armor calculation Battle Stance, Sunder Armor, Mace Specialization, etc. as they may involve other systems that add additional complexity to the calculation.

Cooking
Chef's Hat very high cost
Flavor items can often cost a lot, like the Cenarion War Hippgryph when it was first introduced and the those mammoths from the Sons of Hodir. We don't feel the the need to add special function to things just because they are expensive. I know a number of players who are interested in the hat just for the look and that's what we were going for. Source

Ulduar
Ulduar 10-Man Difficulty
You should be able to do 10-player Ulduar with 10-player Naxx gear. You will most likely find it more challenging than Naxx however. The encounter team has been making dozens of tweaks to the content when they find something bugged or over or under-tuned. It's a little hard to tell at this stage if players who are struggling are running into bugs or overtuned encounters or if they just haven't mastered the mechanics yet. There are no tank and spank boss encounters in Ulduar. Source 

Ulduar-25 Man Difficulty
I think some of you are assuming that since you aren't rolling over the 10-player version that the 25 version must somehow be easier. It's not. Yes it is being cleared, but so far by guilds like Ensidia, Vodka and Premonition. Those are some of the best of the best, and none of them managed it in a three hour run. They will however get to the point where they can farm it, and so will you.

Hard modes are a different story.

And again, in those cases where something is overtuned or bugged, the designers are getting fixes turned around really quickly. Give it a few more tries before you declare it too challenging. Source 

Class balancing on 3.1 live realms
We're not done with balance. We had some great guilds participating on the PTR, but that's no comparison to the thousands of players that will be participating in the 3.1 content "for real" now. As issues arise, we'll address them. Source

Gargoyle lasts 25 seconds instead of 40 according to the tooltip
Gargoyle is working as intended. Because of the way it works some of the tooltips are never going to be totally accurate. To be honest. the entire spell is a little complex and I'm not sure we get much from that complexity. We have discussed changing it to something simpler like no RP over time or something. Source 

Dual-Wield spec nerf
This is one of those categories, like the Conflag nerf, that we feel like you have options. We needed to kill the DW spec where you pretty much ignore weapons and just try and proc big spells. That was not the DW DK style we wanted. We felt like we had a choice between OP DW DKs and no DW DKs and thought the second was a more acceptable risk.

As we have explained, one of our ideas long term is to give Frost a couple of DW talents. It might not take much more than "Your Frost Striks and Oblits now hit with two weapons." Having 3 tanking and PvP trees is challenging enough. Expanding that matrix by also having DW Blood PvP and DW Unholy tanking gets to the insane level. But having DW Frost PvP, DW Frost PvE and DW Frost tanking only may be more manageable. We are not at all sure if this is the approach we will use, but it's an idea.

DKs were overpowered in a few ways. Fixing that was more important thank keeping DW at equal dps to 2H. That does not mean we have given up on DW for DKs in the same way that we no longer support 2H for Enhancement shamans. Source 

[...] We would not turn Frost into a DW tree. We would just make sure all DW DKs were Frost. And again, this is just an idea. We may reject it for some reason. As I have said many times, we want DKs to be a class that uses 2H or DW. We do not want DW to dominate, as it typically does in classes that have that option. Source 

Spell damage for Death Knights
Some spell damage is fine, and an interesting niche for them, but they are designed primarily as a melee class. When you face Arthas, I guarantee he is going to hit you hard with Frostmourne. Source

Conflagrate nerf
If we could go back in time, we would have nerfed it before the build went live. We hoped the changes we put into place would be enough. They were not. Remember, the PTR does not represent every single build we make.

Given that we didn't change it before 3.1 went live, these kind of threads seem to be "Well you missed your chance -- now you're not allowed to fix it," which seems a peculiar argument to me. Source 

Rain of Fire visual effect missing
The projected textures on Rain of Fire etc. cannot be turned on. We had to remove them for perfomance reasons, but want to get them turned back on again soon. Source
