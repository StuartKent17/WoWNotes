<br>
Zul&apos;aman<br>
You now need 5 players to start the even in Zul&apos;aman. (as mentionned in this blue post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2518910681&amp;postId=25734110830&amp;sid=1#3))<br>
<br>
Also, more Zul&apos;aman recolors, I guess it&apos;s pretty much complete, thanks to bas (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=1978.0) for his awesome post. <br>

<br>
<br>
Sound issues<br>
Hardware sound is back, I guess you should really connect on the PTR if you had sound issues before, and report on test realm forums if it&apos;s not resolved yet. <br>
<br>
<br>
Azure Whelpling<br>
As mentioned in the patch notes, you can now drop an Azure Whelpling on elite blue drakes in Azshara, we now have a nice screenshot of it, thanks to Bellacoro (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=1983.0)<br>
