I will keep them online since a lot of the features will probably be in the 2.1.0 official patch, but i suggest that you don&apos;t respec to engineering yet. ^^<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Yep I&#x2019;m Spybot. Well, I should say we&#x2019;re Spybot. My co-worker and I are responsible for the 1.8, 1.12, fake druid BC talent screenshots, and the latest 2.1.0 patch notes. Writing these really pass the time at work :P<br>
<br>
I don&#x2019;t think I need to tell most of you that they&#x2019;re all fake. The reason we write these is to present a list of suggestions that we think would improve the game. I&#x2019;m sure Blizzard would rather us use the suggestions forum :P but obviously fake patch notes will get much more exposure. If you&#x2019;re curious at how we were able to put so many obscure bug fixes and technical stuff, we copied and pasted everything from the UI + Macros and Bug Reports forums. The rest was blue posts and our own input. The &#x201C;KDM&#x201D; shoutout was for Caydiem - sorry for all the headaches with the other patch notes. Anyhow while these patch notes are 100% fake, I hope you at least had fun reading it. &#x201C;<br>

<br>
The Black Temple<br>
Originally founded as a Draenei temple, this plot has been conquered and despoiled many times throughout the history of Outland, removing any spiritual grace it may have once held. The Black Temple has been the stage of the Orc Horde&apos;s blood curse, a fortress for the then-mortal Ner&apos;zhul, and a prime staging ground for the Burning Legion&apos;s campaign of destruction.. Most recently, it has been claimed as home by Illidan, where he and his minions make their bid for power over the remnants of the shattered planet. Now, it is up to you to face the malefic forces of Illidan and his minions in hopes of freeing Outland from chaos and tyranny.<br>
<br>
Battleground Matching System<br>
A player matching system has been put into effect to encourage a more competitive player vs. player environment. The system will work by assigning a &#x201C;gear rating&#x201D; to every player for each honorable kill earned, based on the value of the player&#x2019;s equipped items at the time. These ratings are averaged over many battles, and will be used by the system to match up players of similar strength in cross-realm battlegrounds.<br>

And much more!<br>

Making a selection in a category (Dungeon, Raid, Group Quest, and Zone) will add the player to a player listing with other eligible players seeking a group. The listing indicates whether each player is solo, in a group, or the leader of a group. The auto-join functionality of the LFG tool has been removed.

Spells that have reagent costs will show the number of uses left in the lower right corner of the action icon, just like consumable items on the action bar.<br>
Players will be able to see how much memory the UI is using and the top 3 addons using memory.<br>
The UI memory limit has been removed, and memory profiling features are available.<br>
CPU profiling features are available (but must be enabled).<br>
The Blizzard UI Code has been inspected and several instances of IsVisible corrected to use IsShown as appropriate.<br>
Conditionals on #show and #showtooltip<br>
Memory Profiling<br>
Script memory is now tracked on a per-addon basis, with functions provided to analyze and query usage.<br>
The script memory manager has been optimized and the garbage collection tuned so there is no longer any need for a hard cap on the amount of UI memory available.<br>
NEW: UpdateAddOnMemoryUsage() - Scan through memory profiling data and update the per-addon statistics<br>
NEW: usedKB = GetAddOnMemoryUse(index or &quot;name&quot;) - query an addon&apos;s memory use (in K, precision to 1 byte) - This returns a cached value calculated by UpdateAddOnMemoryUsage().<br>
CPU Profiling<br>
CPU profiling is disabled by default since it has some overhead. CPU profiling is controlled by the scriptProfile cvar, which persists across sessions, and takes effect after a UI reload.<br>
When profiling is enabled, you can use the following functions to retrieve CPU usage statistics. Times are in seconds with about-a-microsecond precision:<br>
NEW: time = GetScriptCPUUsage() - Returns the total timeused by the scripting system<br>
NEW: UpdateAddOnCPUUsage() - Scan through the profiling data and update the per-addon statistics<br>
NEW: time = GetAddOnCPUUsage(index or \&quot;name\&quot;) - Returns the total time used by the specified AddOn. This returns a cached value calculated by UpdateAddOnCPUUsage().<br>
NEW: time, count = GetFunctionCPUUsage(function[, includeSubroutines]) - Returns the time used and number of times the specified function was called. If &apos;includeSubroutines&apos; is true or omitted, the time includes both the time spent in the function and subroutines called by the function. If it is false, then time is only the time actually spent by the code in the function itself.<br>
NEW: time, count = GetFrameCPUUsage(frame[, includeChildren]) - Returns the time used and number of function calls of any of the frame&apos;s script handlers. If &apos;includeChildren&apos; is true or omitted, the time and call count will include the handlers for all of the frame&apos;s children as well.<br>
NEW: time, count = GetEventCPUUsage([&quot;event&quot;]) - Returns the time used and number of times the specified event has been triggered. If &apos;event&apos; is omitted, the time and count will be totals across all events.<br>
NEW: ResetCPUUsage() - Reset all CPU profiling statistics to zero.<br>
NEW: KDM() - Now functions for Tauren Druid characters.<br>
Frames<br>
NEW: Frame:HookScript(&quot;name&quot;, function) - Exactly equivalent to hooksecurefunc(), but usable with frame script handlers. (Note that like hooksecurefunc(), this is not intended as a general hooking replacement, but to allow hooking of secure frame handlers.)<br>
GameTooltip<br>
UPDATED : name, unitid = GameTooltip:GetUnit() - Added second &apos;unitid&apos; return value<br>
NEW: hasComparison = GameTooltip:SetHyperlinkCompareItem(link, index) - Sets a comparison tooltip to show the index&apos;th comparison item to the item specified as link. Will return a true value if there is an index&apos;th comparison item (index is 1 or 2).<br>
API Functions<br>
UPDATED: isSecure, taint = issecurevariable() - Now returns a second value which is the name of the addon that tainted the variable (or the empty string if it was tainted by a macro script), if it is not secure.<br>
UPDATED: GetCursorInfo() will now return &quot;merchant&quot;, index when the cursor holds a merchant item.<br>
NEW - link = GetSendMailItemLink()<br>
Secure Templates<br>
For &quot;item&quot; buttons, name can bean item ID or item link.<br>
Action buttons will automatically update if their action attribute changes (You can even do something like this ActionButton1:SetId(0) ActionButton1:SetAttribute(&quot;action&quot;, 1) ActionButton1:SetAttribute(&quot;shift-action*&quot;, 2) and when you hold down the shift key, it will show the icon, feedback and tooltip for action 2.<br>
The SecureStateHeaderTemplate now supports a small stack of saved states that can be used in state transition rules via push/pop/swap actions (See the header file for usage information)<br>
Macros<br>
New conditional [flyable] which is true if you&apos;re in a location where you could use a flying mount<br>
You can use %f in chat text to refer to your focus, the same way %t or %n refers to your target.<br>
Added macro option support for /dismount.<br>
Macros containing conditionals will automatically update their visual feedback as appropriate during play.<br>
#show and #showtooltip can be given conditionals and will update dynamically<br>
#show and #showtooltip can be given a slot number, to display the appropriate feedback for that slot<br>
Bug Fixes<br>
The raid pullout positions will be saved and restored between sessions<br>
Fixed a bug where frame alpha wasn&apos;t used b the Cooldown frame type<br>
Self cast works with items such as bandages<br>
Fixed errant &apos;this&apos; in ContainerFrameItemButton_OnEnter<br>
Auction house sorting is fixed (There is now sorting by &quot;bid&quot;, &quot;buyout&quot;, and &quot;buyoutthenbid&quot;. The main aucion house browse tab uses &quot;buyoutthenbid&quot; as requested by design. the other two tabs (&quot;bids&quot; and &quot;auctions&quot;) use the proper sort (&quot;bid vs. &quot;buyout&quot;)).<br>
<br>
