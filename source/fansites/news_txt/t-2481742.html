The following hotfixes are now active for all regions.<br>
<br>
Uu&#x2019;nat, Harbinger of the Void<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Subtlety Rogue Hotfixes 4/29<br>
The following hotfixes are scheduled to be live this week.<br>
<br>
Shadowstrike no longer deals reduced damage in PvP (was a 10% reduction).<br>
Eviscerate no longer deals reduced damage in PvP (was a 15% reduction).<br>
Mastery: Executioner is now reduced by 20% in PvP (was 33%).<br>
<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: We&#x2019;ve been keeping an eye on Subtlety&#x2019;s damage during Season 2 and have identified a few prior PvP reductions that we&#x2019;re going to relax to help with its overall damage throughput. With this improvement to Eviscerate combined with the existing PvP-only reduction to Night&#x2019;s Vengeance (Azerite Trait) and the removal of Shuriken Combo we feel Subtlety&#x2019;s potential Eviscerate damage will be brought into an acceptable range for PvP combat. Subtlety will continue to keep its PvP-only reductions to their stackable cooldown strength, but we also felt that it was necessary to increase throughput outside of those windows.<br>
