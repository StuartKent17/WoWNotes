The Test realms will be brought down today at 1:00 p.m. PDT for a patch and maintenance. The expected down time is 3 hours and the realms should be available at 4:00 p.m. PDT.<br>
<br>
Before the PTR downtime, Curse (http://www.curse-guild.org) did a few tries on some bosses of the Black Temple and successfully killed High Warlord Naj&apos;entus and Gurtogg Bloodboil, they also fought Teron Gorefiend but didn&apos;t manage to kill him (partially due to a bug in the encounter)<br>
