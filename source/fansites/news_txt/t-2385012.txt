Legion PvP Season 6 Ends March 20
The gates will close on Legion PvP Season 6 for all Arena and Battleground competitors in as early as two weeks.

Season 6 – End of Season Rewards
If you participated in Season 6, to ensure you receive the rewards that you’re due, please keep the following in mind:


Refrain from transferring your characters to another realm or faction until after Legion Season 6 has ended.
Legion Season 6 titles and mounts will be awarded approximately two weeks after the season ends.


Faction-Based Rewards
Don’t forget—end-of-season rewards are based on your faction. If you transfer your character to the other faction, you must have 50 wins after your transfer to receive the reward. Please note that you must have 150 wins for Gladiator and Dominant Gladiator.
