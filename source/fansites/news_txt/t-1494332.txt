Am I just stupid or bad at hunters or do they seem focused starved 90% of the time?
Starved? No... It's a resource that they build and spend. They have a no-CD builder, so it's impossible to be 'starved'. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445696496713740288

does marksmansnip mastery has cd? my barrage got 40shot under 62%mastery and got less than 10 wild quiver hit
Wild Quiver has a reduced chance to proc from individual Barrage hits since the ability hits so many times so quickly. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/446326248948498432
so,thats mean there a input cd or something else like arms sweeping strike
No cooldown, just a lower chance to proc. It's possible that it could proc from every Barrage hit, just very unlikely. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/446331982151024640

I've taken another stab at the frost math and really hope you'll take a look: http://t.co/Jt1YR143oE
You're using one set of ET% for all builds. That's obviously flawed, since the ET% are based on your stats. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445608357005500417
Mostly by haste. The more haste you have, the more Fb you're going to fit between each LB, for example Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445608687034327040
Keep it up. This peer-review part of theorycrafting is super important, and to me, fun. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445608959827648513
It can be hard; it's not easy posting your work for all to see, and having people point out how you're wrong. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445609097946099712
But I think the process of peer-review is one of the most important parts of theorycrafting, that many specs' communities have been lacking in lately, leading to bad theorycraft spreading and becoming trusted. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445609400007270400
If you guys delivered us an operating manual for each spec, we wouldn't have to guess so wildly
That's neither needed, or the problem. Bad math for the optimal rotation is bad math. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445657749687242752

Healing Spheres being removed for WW? I agree that if feels odd but removing it feels like a loss of a good backup heal.
They're being compensated for that loss elsewhere. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445998482856624129

I think the issue is a slow rotation filled with pauses is considered less "fun", even if it's equal DPS statwise
Right, and I understand that concern, and am informing you that we are keeping that in mind, and not changing it. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445008734507376640
Even so, having limited access to haste will affect how ret feels/play due to not being able to get haste through gem/reforges..
Again, you won't have limited access to haste. You *will* be able to customize gear. You *will* be able to get gear that has... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445010029767184384
...the stats you want. I understand that it's hard to convey through 140char, but your concerns aren't being ignored. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445010146704371712

curious about hopo generation tbh. Feels really good on live, dont want to go back to only 1 hopo generator. Thanks 4 reply
No plans to change HoPo generation significantly. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444998143306784768
Will there be any changes to SoB? Ret will struggle extremely with its current model once gems/reforges are gone.
Sanctity of Battle? No... Why would it? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445001693407633408
Without reforging and gems, the ret rotation will feel very slow and filled with gaps cause of little to no haste.
That's definitely false. Gems are part of items' budgets, and Reforging just moves stats around; no significant change there if... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445004218030510080
...you care about and stack haste. Overall, negligible impact, if any. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445004308266749952
...will make crit/mastery items even more unattractive over a haste+X counterpart, X being crit or mastery.
If you love haste, yes, haste/Anything beats crit/mastery; aim for getting haste items. Regardless, all of the secondary stats... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445007949316911104
...will be useful, and closer in value. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445007998935523328
So SoB & Ret rot. design the same, but we're over-exaggerating how "TAKE IT & SHUT UP" we're imagining stat options?
Very much so. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445011789613240320

If you remove the healing from Divine Star for Shadow, that talent will stop being used by SPriests. Is that the intent?

That's the sort of answer I was hoping for, thanks. What about cd stacking? Enh is a big transgressor there, esp in pvp.
Yeah. Enh is one of the worst, because the strength of their big CD scales with gear. +20%dmg in blues, +100%dmg in 580s. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445674499447353347
Err, big CD*s*. That describes both Fire Elemental and Ascendence. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445674645979541504

No-- enh skill cap is tiny. Simcraft predicts 1.3% difference btw overoptimized and verysimplified priorities.
That says nothing about how high the skill cap is, just how valuable high skill is. We want to raise that value. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445680163733262336

should we expect any big changes to the Enh Shaman rotation / priorities?
Kind of. Enh suffers from a major case of "thirty-different-damage-sources-so-all-of-them-feel-meh"-itis. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445661544399908864
We're generally happy with Enh's gameplay which is whack-a-mole at base skill levels, but does have a high skill cap. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445661765381021697
However, we're going to try to maintain that gameplay, while removing or combining many of the damage sources. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445661889377234944
For example, compare http://t.co/AiVKyUn9sS 12 dmg sources... to http://t.co/dPrdUe81JC 34 dmg sources. Are they all... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445663001983455232
...really needed? Can we combine some? Some are MH vs OH of the same strike, so that's naturally inflating things, but even... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445663225598582785
...still, that's a ton. Anyway, point is, we're going to try to maintain the same gameplay, but fewer, more impactful sources. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445663460538343424
That's the same mentality for most classes moving into WoD, right? Maintaining gameplay, more impactful choices?
Yes, but I think Enhancement exemplifies that most of anyone. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445668036431728640
I'm concerned because the spec is currently fast/full of choice because of all the buttons, is it being dumbed down?
No. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445670458801659904
How so if half the possible choices for every given gcd are removed?
I definitely did not say that half the possible choices for every GCD are being removed. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445670953645637633
It was hyperbolizing for the sake of illustrating my concern.
I said nothing of the sort, though. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445671427488759808
Fair enough, you did not; so what sort of damage sources would be removed if not buttons?
Just Example, not Announcement: Unleash Wind does a pittance of damage, and a useful buff. Could we cut the damage, buff the buff? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445673271401271296
Remove the spell as enh, and replace it with a new melee ability medium damagewith a smaller cooldown = fun + useful
Do you really want *another* meh-dium damage ability? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/445982693722181634

Dear Cele, never gets old, but why be any other dps when you can be warlock? And why did you guys stop game balance hotfixing?
There's a huge conversation to be had about *when* to nerf. Short answer is that nerfing warlocks would also nerf *guilds*. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446704086339944448
Instead, we think the right call is to leave them until Warlords, then fix them there. We agree that they're too strong now Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446704252052721665
I think it's better to balance the class, then nerf content as needed based on the class rebalance.
Requires making an assumption about how many Warlocks guilds were using. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446753924985270272
No need for assumptions, you have the numbers.
...but it varies by guild. That's the point. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446767860254142464

T14 beta, Demo Tank preformance similar to other tanks. Nerfs came. Revert nerfs, rebalance, Demo tank live?
UI support, Active Mitigation skills, multiple cooldowns, talents with defensive benefit, glyphs with defensive benefit, an interesting defensive rotation, defensive value for all stats that's gigantic, Vengeance, DPS tuning, mob control abilities, defensive mechanics that scale at the right rate, community understanding, etc. Warlocks are/were nowhere close to being full-fledged tanks. Sorry, it's just not the same thing. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446889136243232769
feel like there's a similar argument for making prot a dps spec that goes beyond what one talent can do.
On the contrary, Prot Warriors have all of the DPS equivalents of those, or are getting them anyway for other reasons. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447164578720264192

That's great, but when raid needs a tank, Warrior can hit a button and be one, while I have to switch to my alt DK.
That's something you signed up for. We don't treat "ability to respec to a different role" as something we balance. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447437520863641600
No, I didn't. When I signed up as a Warlock, they could only DPS, Warriors could only tank, Paladins and Druids could only heal.
Pretty sure that's objectively false. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447438437402955776
It definitely is. I played vanilla wow. As a fury 2h spec warrior, top dps through BWL and AQ40. Quit lying.
I also played one of those specs widely considered unviable as well, back in vanilla, to great effect. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447439500130516992

Warlords of Draenor Stats
All this talk about base health and base damage; why not exponential scaling, Would make these considerations irrelevant.
We do use exponential scaling, and while the pros drastically outweigh the cons of doing so, needing to squish is the big con. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446699559356338176
I think he also meant zero base value, all value from stats. Which is happening with damage. Useful for health too?
...That /is/ happening for health. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446701121768136704
I misinterpreted something then. Thought base health drastically reduced, not eliminated. Sounds good to me then.
Base health is gone. A naked character has only a bit of health from their base stamina. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446701786041053184

Dodge is not removed from the game. Dodge is removed *from gear*. You already had no dodge on your gear. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446902539661758464

No. It won't be a stat you find on gear, even through gems. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446907513686859778
