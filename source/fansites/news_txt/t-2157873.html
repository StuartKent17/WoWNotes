WoW Token Temporarily Disabled<br>
We&apos;ve encountered a brief technical issue with the WoW Token system which has resulted in it temporarily being disabled in the Americas, Oceanic, and European regions. We&apos;re hard at work to restore functionality and will have it back up and running as soon as possible. <br>
<br>
Thank you for your patience.<br>
<br>
But the ones we have in our inventory will still function properly, yeah? We just can&apos;t purchase them?<br>
Yep!<br>

<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Aluriel&apos;s Mirror (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140795-aluriels-mirror): Healing-over-time effectiveness increased by 140%. Area of effect healing detonation effectiveness reduced by 35%.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; Notes: Aluriel&#x2019;s Mirror&#x2019;s detonation effect is strong when it activates, but hard to rely on. We&#x2019;re increasing the heal-over-time effect significantly to improve the up-front value of this trinket, and reducing the detonation effect slightly to compensate.<br>
<br>
Animated Exoskeleton (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140789-animated-exoskeleton): Absorb amount increased by 33%.<br>
Arcanogolem Digit (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140794-arcanogolem-digit): Damage increased by 30%.<br>
Claw of the Crystalline Scorpid (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140790-claw-of-the-crystalline-scorpid): Damage increased by 30%.<br>
Convergence of Fates (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140806-convergence-of-fates):<br>
<br>
(Frost Death Knight) Proc rate increased by 10% with Empower Rune Weapon, decreased by 23% with Hungering Rune Weapon.<br>
(Unholy Death Knight) Proc rate increased by 68% with Summon Gargoyle, and no change with Dark Arbiter.<br>
(Feral Druid) Fixed a bug that prevented Incarnation from working properly with Convergence, and no change with Berserk.<br>
(Windwalker Monk) Proc rate decreased by 62% with Storm, Earth, and Fire, and decreased by 75% with Serenity.<br>
(Retribution Paladin) Proc rate increased by 250% with Avenging Wrath, and increased by 25% with Crusade.<br>
<br>
Draught of Souls (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140808-draught-of-souls): The Use effect of this trinket now respects the global cooldown. The damage of this trinket is now reduced by 30% for Unholy Death Knights (was reduced by 40%).<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; Notes: Since Draught of Souls deals Shadow Damage, it&#x2019;s increased by Unholy&#x2019;s Mastery, which means we needed to reduce its base damage to keep its overall value similar to other classes. It&#x2019;s currently a little too low, however, so we&#x2019;re increasing the damage it deals for Unholy.<br>
<br>
Entwined Elemental Foci (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140796-entwined-elemental-foci): The amount of Critical Strike, Mastery, and Haste granted by this item has been increased by 5%.<br>
Etraeus&apos; Celestial Map (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140803-etraeus-celestial-map): The amount of Critical Strike, Mastery, and Haste granted by this item has been increased by 5%.<br>
Fury of the Burning Sky (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140801-fury-of-the-burning-sky): Damage increased by 40%.<br>
Icon of Rot (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140798-icon-of-rot): Damage increased by 40%.<br>
Might of Krosus (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140799-might-of-krosus): Damage reduced by 25%, but is now always a critical strike. Also, fixed a bug where the cooldown was incorrectly being reduced if Might of Krosus damaged at least 3 targets. The tooltip for Might of Krosus will display the amount of damage that will result from the critical hit, not the base damage.<br>
Perfectly Preserved Cake (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140793-perfectly-preserved-cake): Absorb amount increased by 140%.<br>
Pharamere&apos;s Forbidden Grimoire (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140800-pharameres-forbidden-grimoire): Damage increased by 85%.<br>
Star Gate (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140804-star-gate): Damage increased by 30%.<br>
