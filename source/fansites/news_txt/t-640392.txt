Now that the new Vault of Archavon boss is active on PTRs, it's probably the time to do the final preview of the Season 6 armor sets. All races and sets are available in high-definition and except for a few minor glitches and sometimes a missing helm because the model wasn't in game yet, everything should look fine. 

Keep in mind that all these models are from a TEST PATCH and if a helm is missing or not centered properly, it will most likely be fixed in a future build.
