Boubouille2011-06-14, 09:48 AMPatch 4.2 - PTR Build 14288
A new build is being deployed on test realms. The build isn't a release candidate anymore and is flagged as "Test" but it's already 4 days old and I doubt it will have any impact on the release date of the patch. 




Also, the language selection menu is now fully implemented and the game is now available in all localizations just by selecting the language from the menu and restart their game. It it looks like more languages are now available and all languages seem to be fully supported in-game. 


 

Strings
The description of the arena season confirms slightly that the patch is to be expected on June 21st.
