Boubouille2011-08-10, 04:21 PMPatch 4.2.2 on Test Realms soon?
A wild Patch 4.2.2 appeared on the test realms download servers a couple of hours ago, and it looks like we'll go through a bugfix patch before we get to see Patch 4.3.


Important - Most of these changes are nothing more than tooltip fixes to reflect Patch 4.2 Hotfixes http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/183042/patch-42-hotfixes already active on live servers. I'm mostly documenting them for the sake of it.
