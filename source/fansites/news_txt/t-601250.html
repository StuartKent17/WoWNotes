<br>
Added updated epic faction rewards. I also changed the font I use to make screenshots of item tooltips, it should be a lot easier to read now.<br>
Screenshot of the new stats on Lady Vashj gloves (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/may/crestfall.jpg), actually the change was here before today&apos;s patch but I forgot to post it ^^<br>
Added major healing glow, not sure if I will do more items changes updates on armor sets/heroic loots, they aren&apos;t complete for the moment and it&apos;s quite stupid to list tons of items without knowing if they changed or not (it would take for ever to check them one by one)<br>

Christmas is early this year. New PTR patch changed items, a lot of items, and it&apos;s not finished !<br>
<br>
<br>
The current build has about a third of a soon-to-be very large number of item changes (nearly every level 70 epic item in the game is in the process of being updated). Don&apos;t base much off of what you see there this weekend.<br>
