Patch 6.2 - Mail PvP Armor
One of the sets we didn't preview in the initial Patch 6.2 PTR post http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4834-Patch-6-2-PTR-Build-19890 is the mail PvP set. These models are currently used on the blue and green quality gear for Warlords Season 2 and Season 3.

How is the auto raid joining going to work exactly? there are still going to be groups focusing on getting their 300 kills, andâ€¦1/2
..You will not be able to enter Ashran if you are in a raid. Once you are in Ashran, you are automatically placed in a raid. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/589279798016409600
Based on server? Random? 1 hour queues just to get curb stomped incoming. RIP Ashran. Never forget. 
We evenly distribute people to reduce wait times. Only time you wait now is in a premade. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/589306548880474112
how will that affect pre mades with group finder?. is that a done thing?
it's a done thing. You can enter as a party but not a raid. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/589280068586721281

Tried to buy a WoW token from the AH, kept getting a msg that there are no tokens. 
That means that all listed tokens have been purchased - try again in a little while and there will probably be some available. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/589464513834946560

The WoW Token http://www.wowdb.com/items/122284-wow-token has remained ~37k in the EU and ~22k in the US over the last week or so. Please keep in mind our visitors do not represent the average WoW player.

Unfortunately Blizzard removed the Wealth category of statistics from the armory back in 2008, so we can't just pull data from the Armory API like we do normally.

Rob Pardo Working With Unity
You may remember that Rob Pardo left Blizzard last summer http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4131-Rob-Pardo-Leaving-Blizzard-Entertainment and appears to have been enjoying his break judging by his Twitter feed https://twitter.com/Rob_Pardo. It looks like he is going to spend some time working with Unity as a Creative Advisor http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/04/22/rob-pardo-world-tour/, making a global tour to meet with developers. Blizzard used the Unity engine to create Hearthstone. Both GamesBeat http://venturebeat.com/2015/04/22/world-of-warcrafts-lead-designer-joins-unity-as-creative-adviser-and-kicks-off-a-world-tour/ and gamesindustry.biz http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-04-22-rob-pardo-partners-with-unity have interviews with Pardo about his new role.
