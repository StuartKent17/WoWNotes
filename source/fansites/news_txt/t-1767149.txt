How is the auto raid joining going to work exactly? there are still going to be groups focusing on getting their 300 kills, andâ€¦1/2
..You will not be able to enter Ashran if you are in a raid. Once you are in Ashran, you are automatically placed in a raid. holinka 
Based on server? Random? 1 hour queues just to get curb stomped incoming. RIP Ashran. Never forget. 
We evenly distribute people to reduce wait times. Only time you wait now is in a premade. holinka 
how will that affect pre mades with group finder?. is that a done thing?
it's a done thing. You can enter as a party but not a raid. holinka 

Misc
Tried to buy a WoW token from the AH, kept getting a msg that there are no tokens. 
That means that all listed tokens have been purchased - try again in a little while and there will probably be some available. WatcherDev

The WoW Token  has remained ~37k in the EU and ~22k in the US over the last week or so. Please keep in mind our visitors do not represent the average WoW player.

Unfortunately Blizzard removed the Wealth category of statistics from the armory back in 2008, so we can't just pull data from the Armory API like we do normally.
