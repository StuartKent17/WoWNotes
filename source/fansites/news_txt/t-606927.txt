Boubouille2008-04-21, 07:10 AMNew Season 4 Item discovered - Satin Robe and Hood
Looks like someone pushed the wrong button again, the Brutal Gladiator's Satin Robe http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/brutalgladiatorsatinrobe.jpg and the Brutal Gladiator's Satin Hood http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/brutalgladiatorsatinhood.jpg have been activated on a server EU-Arathor, it's the result of an error made by a GM who gave the wrong item to someone and as I write this news, it's probably already fixed.

Other item stats
Very important note : Most of these items have "outdated" stats, the armor on the sets should be slightly higher. The only armor set up-to-date with the latest version of the PTR is the Paladin one. Keep in mind that all of them are from PTRs and could have been changed since then.

WotLK Alpha fake screenshots
During the weekend we saw a lot of forum posts with screenshots from the alpha test of Wrath of the Lich King attached. They're all fake. And to prevent people from posting them again and again I guess it's worth showing a few of them in news. 

Blizzcon screenshots
Well, these screenshots aren't fake, but they aren't new either. They're just old pictures taken from the Blizzcon and other conventions and they probably aren't representative of the game in its current state.

Kanaru's fakes/fan-creations
These one are really popular lately, but sadly none of the following screenshots are official. They've been created by Kanaru http://www.wowwiki.com/User:Kanaru and even if the new hairstyles are very nice, it will just be a coincidence if you see any of them in Wrath of the Lich King. 

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/1_s.jpg http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/1.jpg http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/2_s.jpg http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/2.jpg http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/3_s.jpg http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/3.jpg http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/4_s.jpg http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/4.jpg


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/DalaranLake_s.jpg http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/DalaranLake.jpg http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/GrizzlyHillsUnfinished_s.jpg http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/GrizzlyHillsUnfinished.jpg http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/HowlingFjord_s.jpg http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/HowlingFjord.jpg http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/Template_s.jpg http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/Template.png

Other fakes
There is also a fake login screen http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/fakeloginwotlkwe1.jpg from this forum post http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2215492691&sid=1&pageNo=3 and a few other things character creation screen, skills, etc ... from people slightly less talented than this guy. Conclusion: There isn't any new screenshot from the alpha, and anything you'll see linked on forums for the next weeks is probably a huge fake. 


World of Warcraft "hidden" Servers
During the week end, a few people found a way to get the full list of servers http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=6581.0 available and "registered" on WoW's official website. I will only list the ones that aren't available to players below because there might be a few interesting information here 32 Arena Tournament servers ??, however keep in mind that :
Please don't take it as a confirmation of the old zone list post http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=1547.0, Blizzard has been using the names of important lore figures for age to name their servers, and having their name as a server really doesn't mean that we're sure to see them in game. 
They're internal data, be careful before doing any interpretations.
