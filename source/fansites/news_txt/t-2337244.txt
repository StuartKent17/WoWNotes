The team went into Legion knowing that they might have to revisit some of the classes that received major changes once player feedback was collected.
There most likely will not be complete class revamps again any time soon.
Mythic dungeons are a great way to show off each class’s unique toolkit.
The team likes classes having unique abilities.
Going forward a big question is what unique abilities each class should have.
The team wants to spread out class strength and weaknesses more.
Utility will be spread out and balanced more in the future.
Everyone should feel like they have some sort of cooldown to help them survive.
The best thing the team can do to help showcase unique abilities is to have more variety in dungeon encounters.
Talent tweaks and the future of the class artifact abilities are being looked at moving forward.
The passive health increase on Artifact Weapons was essentially to also help healers heal into a set of players with higher health pools who take more damage that stays balanced with the amount of healing done.
Thorns and other design elements are being experimented with more to counter the issue of healing getting boring as players get stronger.
The team is pretty happy with where raid cooldowns are at now.
Steady damage is important to the design of healing in encounters.

Thanks all for another incredible BlizzCon full of excitement and hugs. I love this community so much! Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/927249082917142528
Was talking back stage with one of the convention organizers, who works on several big conventions... he said something that made me think. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/927249707511902208
"You look at big cons like ComicCon, E3, GamesCom, ChinaJoy... those are for hundreds of games/things. BlizzCon is for 5 games [franchises]" Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/927250368643268608
"BlizzCon matches them in scale with the new North Hall, with just 5 games. It's incredible.", he said. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/927250594854723584
It really is incredible. It's because of the people. The community. The FAMILY. I am so honored to have the privilege to contribute to it. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/927251109948768256

In a creative industry, it's valuable to let your creatives take some time every cycle to work on whatever they're passionate about. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925209563141251072
WoW's level designers took on crafting the oceans of Broken Isles as a fun project once pencils were down for most of the world. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925210061835603968
I'd encourage everyone to take a swim, you'll find all kinds of cool little moments, and giant pearls, and salty krakens, and passion/love. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925210325992927232
Plus it drives the Secret Finding Discord nuts so, bonus Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925222028403027968

I would consider everyone a creative - designers, artists, engineers can be creative, even producers with their multi-colored spreadsheets! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925224112590438401
Did you know that Gull Rock in Stormheim was created by a producer that wanted to see what would happen if he learned to add seagulls? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925224438387245056
The result was a LOT of seagulls, who were then eaten by Falcosaurs. Never forget the look he gave me when I told him they ate his seagulls Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925225275423571968
A combination of unfathomable sadness and "did you have time for that, let me consult my spreadsheet" Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925227433493544961
