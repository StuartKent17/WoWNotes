Warlords of Draenor Racial Traits
We’re planning some changes to racial traits for Warlords of Draenor. We recently posted a Dev Watercooler Pruning the Garden of War that dives deeper into the philosophy behind these changes, and now we wanted to give you the full details of what’s coming.

In order to keep racials more in line with one another, we’ve decided to bring down a couple of high outliers, then establish a fair baseline and bring the other racials up to that. We’re accomplishing this by improving old passives, replacing obsolete ones, and adding a few new ones where necessary. Ultimately, our goal is to achieve much better parity among races.

There aren’t any current plans to change Pandaren or Worgen racials.

Blood Elf
Arcane Acuity is a new racial passive ability that increases Critical Strike chance by 1%. Arcane Torrent now restores 20 Runic Power for Death Knights up from 15 Runic Power, 1 Holy Power for Paladins, or 3% of Mana for Mage, Priest, Warlocks up from 2% of Mana. Other aspects of the ability remain unchanged.

Draenei
Heroic Presence has been redesigned. It no longer increases Hit by 1%, and instead increases Strength, Agility, and Intellect, scaling with character level. Gift of the Naaru now heals for the same amount over 5 seconds down from 15 seconds.

This has not yet been implemented.
