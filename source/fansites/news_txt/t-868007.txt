Boubouille2011-03-13, 11:50 PMDeath Knight Solo Yogg-Saron Kill
The solo kill of Yogg-Saron  got quite a lot of attention on forums last week and "some people" eventually convinced me that it was a shame to not front page it, I agree! Mionelol  managed to solo the last boss of Ulduar with a Death Knight and will probably make you cry if you're one of those people who wiped on the encounter in a weird achievement-run PUG.

The kill is definitely impressive, congratulations! The video can also be found on WarcraftMovies  if Youtube hates your country.

Patch 4.1 Updated TBC Maps
Patch 4.1 will add the last wave of missing dungeon maps to the game by updating all the TBC content! Most TBC 5-man dungeons and raid instances got a shiny new world map.

The latest PTR build also included the maps of Zul'Aman and Zul'Gurub and the updated map for Baradin Hold with a brand new wing/boss! Keep in mind that the next arena season is scheduled for Patch 4.2, you won't see that part of Baradin Hold before a few months.
