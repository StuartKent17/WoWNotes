Patch 5.4.1 Live This Week<br>
Patch 5.4.1 goes live this week, bringing updates to the Recruit a Friend system, the Blizzcon pet (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/106244-murkalots-flail), and tooltip updates to reflect the Patch 5.4 hotfixes. The previously mentioned merging of all previous patches into one file has been reverted, so it should be a very small download.<br>
<br>
Murkalot<br>
Murkalot&apos;s Flail (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/106244-murkalots-flail) is the Blizzcon Reward pet added in Patch 5.4.1, and grants the Murkalot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/8793-murkalot) achievement. If you aren&apos;t going to Blizzcon, you can still get him by purchasing the Virtual Ticket (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/virtual-ticket/faq).<br>

Recruit-A-Friend Updates Coming Soon<br>
It&#x2019;s been a while since we&#x2019;ve updated the Recruit-A-Friend program, but the time has come once again to close the doors for a bit and do a little remodeling. On Tuesday, October 15, we&#x2019;ll be temporarily shutting down new Recruit-a-Friend sign-ups. Don&#x2019;t worry though&#x2014;the program will be back (and better than ever) before you know it.<br>
<br>
While we don&#x2019;t have an official date to share regarding the release of the updated Recruit-A-Friend (RAF) program, those whose accounts are already linked are not affected by this, and any unclaimed rewards will be redeemable once the program starts up again. You&#x2019;ll also be happy to learn that the current reward will still be available when the Recruit-A-Friend program returns&#x2014;in fact, players who participate in the upcoming program will have even more reward options available to them. We&#x2019;ll have more details for you at a future point in time.<br>

Realm Population Issues<br>
Blizzard has currently done everything they can, pouring tons of resources and money into making a system that allowed cross realm, guilds and servers.<br>
<br>
People are stuck on ether a dead server or a server with a queue of two hour. How to solve this you ask? Well here we go, this conclusion will blow your brains out, it took me years of thinking, but I think I finally know how it can be solved! Are you ready!?<br>
<br>
Make paid character transfers free already. <br>
<br>
The resources they put into making cross realm guilds would have been better if put into a creating a automated transfer system.<br>
<br>
What do you guys think? would free char transfer solve these issue?<br>
Actually, it might make matters worse. <br>
<br>
Hypothetical situation: You&apos;re on a nicely balanced realm with a healthy population. The next day a large portion of players from your faction decide to move to another realm for whatever reason, maybe to dominate the opposite faction there. With no cost involved, it would be an easy thing to up and move on the spur of the moment. Your realm would now be quieter and you&apos;d be on the minority faction. You&apos;d probably want to move as well after that. Would anyone from your faction ever roll a char or transfer willingly to that server once the faction balance was skewed like that? <br>
<br>
Right now, if people could freely move to whatever server they wanted, what do you think would happen? I strongly suspect the busier realms would get busier and the quieter realms would get quieter. The horde-heavy realms would become horde-only and the same with Alliance.<br>
<br>
But I&apos;m genuinely interested in your opinion on this, what do you think would happen?<br>
<br>
Oh yes what about connected realms ? It was suggestively due for 5.4 but right now it just looks like GMs&apos; little playground, where they seem to pick on a day basis what servers would be fun for them to connect, for example on the French side, Naxxramas and Temple noir who are both deserted, which must be useful...<br>
Connected Realms were designed specifically to tackle the issue of low population realms. We&apos;ve begun with the process as mentioned here, and there are many more realms yet to be connected. It has been a long and careful process, selecting which realms to connect, and we&apos;re pushing forward with it carefully but purposefully. Realms will continue to be connected with other realms until they have a healthy population, so please don&apos;t assume that we&apos;re done with the realms that have been involved so far if their population isn&apos;t yet ideal.<br>
<br>
As I said earlier, the ability to move for free, even with a cooldown, could potentially cause overnight faction/population fluctuations which the current costs somewhat prevent. However, we are always looking for ways to help with faction imbalance/population issues, so please continue with your feedback.
