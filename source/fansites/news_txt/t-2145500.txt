Beast Mastery Hunter Legendary Change
The belt change is part of an overall balance pass on a few legendaries, following what Lore mentioned a couple of weeks ago, and wasn't meant as a specific targeted change to the BM rotation.

To be frank, I don't play Beast Master, so I'm not fully aware of the "consequences" of this legendary, specifically, to the rotation. I read that it resolved focus issues, but our goal should be for these legendaries to augment gameplay, not to provide a necessary change to the spec such to that it cannot perform without it. Feel free to enlighten me. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
