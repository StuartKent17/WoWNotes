Beta Build Update - 6/19/2018
Greetings all, 

Realms came down a bit ago to facilitate a new build update. No ETA for today's push but things should be coming up soon.

Also, character copy will be enabled! Please note that under load, the character copy system could fail to create at times due to volume of requests. If things seem slow, take a deep breath, wait a bit and try again later.

I'll leave this thread open for discussion as long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines.

Thanks for your patience everyone!
