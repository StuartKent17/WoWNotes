Warlords of Draenor - Darker Nights<br>
The darker nights that Mumper mentioned (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/484028160787238913) recently appeared in a few locations in Beta. Below we have a few examples of day time from beta, nighttime from live, and night time from beta. The video also shows a complete day/night cycle for each location.<br>

The Gaze of the Black Prince Returns<br>
Beginning Tuesday, July 15 at 9:00 a.m. PDT, through Tuesday, July 29 at 9:00 a.m. PDT, we&#x2019;ll be applying the Gaze of the Black Prince (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/161780-gaze-of-the-black-prince) buff which will increase the reputation gained with the Black Prince by 100%. It will also increase the chance of obtaining items from his foes needed as a part of the Legendary Cloak quest line including: the Secrets of the Empire (http://www.wowdb.com/items/94593-secrets-of-the-empire), Sigil of Wisdom (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87209-sigil-of-wisdom), Sigil of Power (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87208-sigil-of-power), or Titan Runestone (http://www.wowdb.com/items/94594-titan-runestone). <br>

Warlords of Draenor Theorycraft Discussion<br>
It&apos;s me or Crackling Jade Lightning in Stance of the Wise Serpent with Jade Serpent Statue don&apos;t proc Eminence (Statue) ? Is it intentional?<br>
Yes, Eminence only works for the Monk in Crane Stance. (Xuen still causes Eminence regardless of the Monk&apos;s stance)<br>
<br>
1. For stat calculating purposes, how does the Night Elf racial Touch of Elune determine whether its currently night or day? <br>
Server time.<br>
<br>
Possible to get current proc rates/data on the various new weapon enchants?<br>
They&apos;re extremely untuned still. Once we get them at least ballpark tuned, I&apos;ll provide that data. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/318876-warlords-of-draenor-theorycraft-discussion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13087818929?page=19#365))<br>

still looking for Hunter changes. 3 BA&apos;s on premade 100 and only 1 single proc of LnL.<br>
Of course, because you&apos;re not Multistrike geared yet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485718811593555968))<br>

Have BrM monks received all the ability pruning they are gonna get...they still seem to have a lot of buttons&amp;redundant skills?<br>
No more major changes planned there, no. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485576022142640128))<br>

Healing beta. Priest. Should I start treating flash heal as greater heal, not flash heal? In usage amounts, comparing early Cata<br>
Kind of. It&apos;s similar in that it&apos;s your high-throughput heal. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485614993572765696))<br>

Can multistrike proc Lightning Strike &amp; Eruption too? 1 Lava Beam w/ 2 multistrikes gen 15 charges = 5 eruptions from 1 cast?<br>
Nope. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485549833436930049))<br>
Shame, could&apos;ve looked pretty awesome to see a few go off at the same time <br>
Oh you definitely can see a couple go off at the same time, just on different targets. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485561266627289088))<br>
That&apos;s great, it looks very aesthetically pleasing. Was secretly hoping to see it rather frequently <br>
Get a bunch of Mastery and spam Chain Lightning; it&apos;ll be frequent. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485575795448893440))<br>
<br>
Now that Elemental has no overload will our spell damage be increased to compensate?<br>
Elemental did not lose Overload; it got merged with Multistrike. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485961283754160128))<br>
But everybody has Multistrike will all classes be balanced around the possibility to &quot;overload&quot;?<br>
Elemental&apos;s Multistrikes are different; much stronger. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485961754661244929))<br>
(But yes, all classes will be balanced around the existence of Multistrike.) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485961930834587648))<br>
<br>
Earth Shield does not seem to have an internal CD on procs in the WoD beta. Sometimes gone in a couple of GCDs. Intended?<br>
I believe we&apos;re trying it out as such. Much more effective as a heal this way. However, may be too strong, or annoying. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/486102502538887168))<br>

Average? It&apos;s literally within the bottom 4 overall for 25HM SoO and bottom 3 for 10HM. It&apos;s underperforming overall<br>
Looking at rankings for Demo is entirely deceptive, because most of the top Warlocks are Aff/Destro. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485560570129571840))<br>
<br>
Any demo buffs? Literally no demos on ladder. Feels bad, man.<br>
That&apos;s a tuning issue. (And to be fair, it&apos;s a tuning issue with Aff/Destr, not Demo).We haven&apos;t done tuning yet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485507203575468033))<br>
It is a tuning issue with demo, actually. Demo has little ability to kill and little pressure against other players.<br>
Oh, apologies, I was talking PvE. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485508748631228416))<br>
So does this mean demo is going to stay same and des/aff is going to be slightly nerfed?<br>
It should come as no shock to hear that Aff/Destro are overpowered on live. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485540554902482944))<br>
It&apos;s HIGHLY underrepresented in medium to top end guilds, that isn&apos;t a coincidence<br>
Demo is underrepresented because the Warlocks up there strongly favor Aff/Destro, not because it&apos;s weak (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485541625284681730))<br>
lolwut. It&apos;s underrepresented because it underperforms compared to Destro/Aff.<br>
That&apos;s... exactly what I just said? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485550121271050240))<br>
You can re-read your last post, if you&apos;d like, to see where you&apos;re wrong.<br>
Yeah, I don&apos;t get it. Demo is not UP; Aff/Destro are OP (in PvE). Thus, top guilds&apos; Warlocks are mostly Aff/Destro. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485560293242580992))<br>
While they are OP, Demo is underpowered compared to almost every other single spec in the game. Again, bottom 4 25HM/bottom 3 10<br>
And again, those rankings are useless. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485561051702784000))<br>

Art<br>
Can taurens get around 2 feet back? watching beta streams I noticed they lost a lot of height. They should look taller imo.<br>
That&apos;s strange man - we matched skeletons one to one on all new PC&apos;s. It might be illusion w/ movement. We&apos;ll take a look (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/485219654793969664))<br>
<br>
Any chance of the old models of shaman totens being updated to match the new char models? great work on those models btw<br>
I&apos;d love to, it&apos;s on my radar. Totems are so cool, we could do a lot with updating them. No ETA, but I agree they need it (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/485221754072473601))<br>
<br>
Will we possibly see white skin color for Worgen in WoD? It&apos;s becoming a bit depressing being black, grey, grey or grey.<br>
its now on the list. This would be something we might add after PC update. (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/485510623468720128))<br>
<br>
Will there be new faces added for each race or even the accessories you were looking into, like panda highlights?<br>
Not at this stage. This is only an update of existing options in game. Would like to do so at some point, no eta (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/485512512558092288))<br>
<br>
Please tell me female draenei are getting longer tails that have animation. I&apos;m so tired of of sausage tail!<br>
This would be something we might add in the future after we update existing features. (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/485513862922649600))<br>
<br>
loving chars in beta, playing the chars is better then seeing in artcrafts, sad feather option for tauren horns is gone.<br>
We might bring the feather back (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/485514357581705216))<br>
<br>
Knowing that nothing is yet final, are there any plans for an brighter orange dwarf hair color like the old one?<br>
Been thinking about that, I agree we missed the value on that color. I&apos;ll look into it (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/485222028329619456))<br>
<br>
Thank you for taking a second look. We just want some feeling of diversity in the faces.<br>
I hear ya, that&apos;s definitely our desire and goal at this stage. (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/485504133164957696))<br>
<br>
Is the new human female model definitive or is it subject to change? Can&apos;t see my old char reflected http://t.co/ycgWabMIef<br>
Definitely subject to change, we&apos;re now fine tuning each face, altering base pose to more closely match original structure/emotion (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/485217439362580480))<br>
in this case we will be adjusting eyebrows, as well as looking at eye color, lip color, mouth shape, etc. (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/485217821744713730))<br>
This is all part of our plan to address &quot;same face&quot;. I had hoped to get out an Artcraft for this but tendon in finger detached - (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/485218684261376000))<br>
<br>
What about the undead empty eye socket faces? Any chance we&apos;ll get those back?<br>
When we&apos;re finished - you should have everything you started with. We don&apos;t want to cut/lose any features. (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/485510268429295616))<br>
<br>
Male or female trolls next maybe? Pretty please? I think it&apos;s high time they&apos;ve gotten an artcraft or at least*some* reveal<br>
They&apos;ll be coming up soon. Had to model mouth in flat line, then use animation posing to form lips around tusks. Showing them (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/485508958871117824))<br>
without that posing would have been disastrous. Hence the wait They look great now - we&apos;ll get something out asap (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/485509465270394881))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Chance we could have Beta Shatt Target Dummies on Live servers? Maybe a special room that is phased? Able to learn a lot there<br>
It&apos;s something we&apos;re considering, but we&apos;d want to kit them up a lot more. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/485608351078690817))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
will lower level skirmishes give XP? Would be a nice change from questing/dungeon leveling. Maybe like as much XP as a quest?<br>
We&apos;re planning on granting some XP from skirmishes. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486208442558717953))<br>
<br>
Will Ashran have solid trees, for LoS cover?<br>
Trees have never had LoS in WoW for technical reasons. We&apos;re avoiding putting them in contested gameplay spaces. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486220815453532160))<br>
<br>
Are there any plans to bring back mana burns/drains? From what I see, a lot of healers not getting punished for standing in los.<br>
There are no plans to bring back mana burns/drains. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486280134689697792))<br>
<br>
UI / Addons<br>
will the limit of 50 mails be raised with wod?<br>
No plans to change that - you can have far more than 50, but only 50 get displayed at once. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/486215253655420928))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
How big will our garrisons grow eventually? Won&apos;t fit all of the buildings, I fear? Pick &amp; choose the best ones? Can we rebuild?<br>
Pretty large, but not large enough to have everything. You can bulldoze and change buildings as much as you want, though! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/486212299892346880))<br>
<br>
I thought there were 4 small plots has that changed now to 3? Also is the current design of requiring Alch to progress just for beta<br>
On plots, current plan is 3 smalls at Tier 3 now. (mumper (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/486233796757299201))<br>
So the fourth small is scrapped?<br>
No tier 4, the Garrison upgrades from 1 to 3. Lots of iteration still in progress, hence &quot;current plan&quot; (mumper (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/486317532635074560))<br>
<br>
how many large plots at the max teir and is that barracks, alchemy lab, town hall teir considered tier 1 for garisons?<br>
Tier 1 currently has a small and a large plot for buildings. (mumper (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/486318271671435264))<br>
<br>
No previously made statements imply that having a gathering prof improves the overall yield from your mine/garden/barn.<br>
Both the Mine and Herb Garden will let folks without the matching gathering skill create work orders for mats. (mumper (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/486397186906017792))<br>
Having the matching gathering skill will let you harvest the local garrison nodes in the mine/garden. (mumper (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/486396480874614784))<br>
so will we get enough mats out of our garrison &amp; should drop gathering or it will must supplement miserable ground based gathering<br>
Will still be valuable to have gathering skills, don&apos;t want to lose that. (mumper (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/486775183605133312))<br>
<br>
World<br>
Is the return of darker night going into places like Elwynn Forest etc as well?<br>
The plan is to get it in as many places as possible. (mumper (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/486942998173720576))<br>
