Pls reconsider Warlock tanks. I know &quot;significant changes&quot; are necessary, but would be a great addition. More tanks = better<br>
Agree that more tanks = better. Not sure (based on DK, monk) that more tank classes gives you more tanks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278572247696936962))<br>

Pls do something about BM Kill Command, it cost more focus than arcane shot and does less damage, as bm main spell, FIX pls!<br>

Ghost, I&apos;ve being playing DK since LK. Dont you think comparing to other calsse DK has low mobility and survival?<br>
Mobility, yes, but you have Death Grip and ranged attacks. Survivability is low after CDs are burned. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278300931861389312))<br>

No really, are you kidding? Because Blood Presence doesn&apos;t do crap for me but reduce my damage.<br>

Kinda like how feral charge has to have a stun or you wont end up at the target? Oh wait...<br>
Wild Charge for bears does a root and for cats a snare. Should be close to the same result as far as ending up on target. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279644527533363201))<br>

Blizz likes to say &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot;. Give me a good reason to bring an MM hunter to an arena (rather than bm)<br>
I promise a skilled dude on MM will beat a bad dude on BM. That was not true back when we came up with BTP and why we did. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280042353409003520))<br>
<br>
Can you elaborate on the &quot;hunters have too many buttons&quot; thing? A lot of people enjoy it.. Do you intend to remove abilities?<br>
But overall, we think hunters have too many situational abilities and cooldowns. # of rotational abilities is generally good. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279761101934178304))<br>
I&apos;m curious, whats your distinction between 1) situational abilities, 2) cooldowns and 3) rotational abilities?<br>
Deterrence - situational. BW - cooldown. Arcane Shot - rotational. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280027655863140352))<br>

Critical Mass now multiplies the critical strike by 1.3 was 1.25. This is nothing in comparison to the -10/15 % dps nerf u did<br>

can u pls answer me? i see u hotfix mages with buffs can u do the same with monks in pvp? 2months and still no team for my ww<br>

(PvE 25 hc) Doing more healing as Disc spamming PoH then Holy using a lot of spells feels so wrong. Mana &amp; DA/SS is the issue.<br>
Disc mastery lets Spirit Shell turn PoH into a HPS increase rather than &quot;just&quot; a bubble. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278268987261976577))<br>

cancelled sub bc rogues werent fun (too slow big numbers doesn&apos;t =fun) seems like rogues are dying out http://t.co/bpObp6R2<br>
I don&apos;t think our numbers show a decline like that, but rogue popularity is lower than we&apos;d like. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278686201010085889))<br>
<br>
Do you feel Subtlety suffers the same as what happened with Mage? Not underpowered, but underplayed skewing the numbers?<br>
Potentially. If you take Combat for any cleave fight, then Mutilate for the others, you don&apos;t have a spec left. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278268417864241152))<br>

Just read some of your tweets regarding Shaman from last month. Stop being a dick to your players. They have real concerns.<br>
I&apos;ve tried to address those concerns, but I feel at this point many of them are only interested in us undoing the Silence change. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278271507606691840))<br>

since mages arcane brilliance gives spell power and critical strike, why doesn&apos;t warlocks dark intent give a second buff?<br>

Warriors choose Shockwave mostly out of fear of losing grip. Why not increase Charge stun &amp; make it share DR w/Shockwave?<br>
Charge needs to have a stun or you won&apos;t end up at the target. Having the Charge stun DR frequently kills Charge. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278688463321198592))<br>
<br>
Do you think Shockwave is too oppressive in PvP? IMO: Should cost 10 Rage, deal 0 damage and have a 30 Sec CD. Thoughts?<br>
We&apos;re sensitive to nerfing an ability that Prot has had forever. We have an idea we&apos;re trying out though to accomplish both. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278574809703673856))<br>
<br>
You tell DKs to pop blood pres to lower taken damage, while losing damage meanwhile warriors lose nothing in defensive stance.<br>
They are intended to lose rage. It may be that Second Wind is providing too much. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278574573082013696))<br>
<br>
Of all the new abilities in MoP, Second Wind has hurt my enjoyment of the game more than any other. Just sayin.<br>
It ended up much more powerful (and the rage part too) than it appeared to be during beta. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278271798653624320))<br>
<br>
What is your current view on Second Wind?<br>
Pretty sure it&apos;s overpowered in both healing and rage, but want to see if the recent PvP healing nerf fixes it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279403910060453888))<br>
Does the healing nerf really apply to a set % health tick talent though? 3% is 3% regardless, else the talent lies.<br>
The Battle Fatigue debuff applies to all healing, even % self heals like Recuperate and SW. We&apos;ll check to test for sure. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279646284963536896))<br>
<br>
Have you realised that every Warrior ever is using Defensive Stance in PVP yet? 25% less damage taken is to good to pass up.<br>
Trying to figure out how accurate that is. Warriors say they only do it when being tunneled. Looking into it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279650983590637570))<br>
What would be an acceptable range though? 50% of the time in Defensive Stance? Only during Second Wind?<br>
Ideally, when you&apos;re being offensive you&apos;re in Battle and when you&apos;re being beat on, you go Defensive. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279657222089367553))<br>
<br>
When Warriors are decent and Viable, players spam QQ threads till we get nerfed back to CATA style Warrior... wheelchair mode.<br>
Having said that, we agree with folks who felt warriors were too strong. We do want to keep them viable and fun though, (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279404675487371266))<br>
I think there is a tendency that once the biggest offenders are fixed then the next offender in line looks big. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279404418452041728))<br>

Misc<br>
I get the impression that people take a lot of your tweets more literally than the &#x201C;25 hours/day 8 days/week&#x201D; sense intended.<br>
My conversational style has a lot of sarcasm and exaggeration, which don&apos;t translate well to Twitter. I&apos;ll learn. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275755423548731393))<br>
<br>
...plus your recent &amp; helpful discussion with the podcasting community helped provide an added layer of feedback. Well done.<br>
Interviews always convey more info than tweets or forum posts (and help out the community too). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280040798744092672))<br>
<br>
Why were the fully raid buffed DPS dummies not implemented on live servers - only PTR? Intention behind this?<br>
We don&apos;t want players to obsess with theoretical DPS. Who wins a target dummy doesn&apos;t actually mean anything. On PTR it&apos;s to help us. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279064255775510528))<br>

I&apos;m worried that you&apos;ve reached the end of what you can do with this graphics engine. Can you beat MOP in another xpack?<br>
Have you seen at the graphic improvements between Cat and MoP? The engine isn&apos;t a static thing. They improve it continually. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279063867819163648))<br>
<br>
Don&apos;t forget about EU bro! Hotfixes gone live for days on US are not live on EU! Hey, hey! <br>
Not ideal, but it just depends on whether the servers need to be restarted or not. For serious fixes, we do rolling restarts. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279650497915400192))<br>
<br>
Yes please don&apos;t go back to old model when all you do was sit in a city and queue. A lot of people LOVE MoP, silently.<br>
Players tend to communicate more when they&apos;re unhappy than happy. Indifferent folks don&apos;t post to say they&apos;re indifferent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277538407025106946))<br>
<br>
Are you convinced &quot;going slow&quot; was the right design philosophy to put to players?<br>
We are convinced that letting players finish the expansion in a couple of weeks is not good for the game. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280041691593986048))<br>
<br>
What is the most underrepresented race/class combo? My bet is on Dwarf Mage.<br>
That one and tauren priest are probably most rare. Monks of some races rare too. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277164087199268865))<br>
