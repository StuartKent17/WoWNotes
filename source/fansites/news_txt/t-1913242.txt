Blue Tweets
Racials
Will there be any changes at all to Racials in Legion. Or happy with how they turned out after changes in WoD?
Overall they're pretty solid, but we'll tweak them as needed for Legion. 1/2 WarcraftDevs 
The Human racials in particular may need to change, to account for the new PvP systems. 2/2 WarcraftDevs 

Classes
Discussion topic: If someone said, "DPS performance is measured granularly. HOW MUCH dps did you do? Tank performance is measured mostly... Celestalon 
...in binary terms. Did you mess up a taunt swap, forget to cooldown, lose aggro? DPS and Mitigation hardly matter." Celestalon 
Would you agree/disagree with this statement? Do you think it's a good or bad thing? Celestalon 
Clarification, I'm not referring to the issue of how to measure Tank performance, but rather to what actually matters or doesn't matter. Celestalon 

are we going to see any ways of pushing more offense as tanks in the talent trees or kit?
Trading defense for offense is just one of many ways we can create engaging tank gameplay. 1/2 WarcraftDevs 
It's something we'll continue to iterate on, and feedback is especially important! 2/2 WarcraftDevs 

Will ability perks go away completely in #legion or new ones?
Draenor Perks will be retiring. Many of their effects are being "baked in" to the baseline abilities, however. WarcraftDevs 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
will Hotstreak for fire mages still be a buff? Or will it be part of the UI and not dispellable?
Hot Streak remains as a buff. WarcraftDevs 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
How is Windwalker's Serenity talent going to work with their new mastery? Seems counterproductive.
Serenity will be tweaked to account for the new Windwalker Mastery. WarcraftDevs 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Is Combat spec now Outlaw the only one being renamed? Others could also be renamed Holy Priest vs Holy Pally?.
Holy, Restoration, and Protection have been shared forever, and describe the specs. Combat was changed to Outlaw because it didn't. WarcraftDevs 

Is killing spree still available in legion? 
Killing Spree is a talent option for Outlaws. WarcraftDevs 

Artifact Weapons
How long do you anticipate it taking a reasonably diligent player to max out traits a weapon? A month? Multiple patches?
Not multiple patches. Most likely between 1 and 3 months, but we haven't finalized tuning on it yet. WarcraftDevs 

can we unlock ALL artifact traits or do we have to choose certain paths?
You will eventually be able to unlock the entire tree. WarcraftDevs 

PvE
Does the highest ilvl legendary ring usage affect all players with ring dps or is it their own ilvl that counts when popped
Each person's own ring determines the magnitude of the effect for them. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
how is The arena prep time going to work with all this talents?,pve,pvp,artifact.
Talents and PvP talents can be changed during Preparation. Artifact traits cannot. WarcraftDevs 

will honor talents unlock quite "fast" or is it going to be "hard"?
The exact rate is yet to be determined, but the intention is that reaching max honor level will take some time. WarcraftDevs 

why would people serious about pvp reset their level for prestige and then re-level? They would lose pvp effectiveness, right?
Prestige is an optional form of progression with its own rewards. There is a related cost, and some players may choose not to do it. WarcraftDevs 

Will the PvP gear stat template be available for lower levels? Or will our gear in PvP be the PvE stats at lower levels?
The PvP stat templates will apply at lower levels and scale accordingly. WarcraftDevs 
Will iLvL have any impact on lower level PvP, or will the scaling take care of any difference in stats?
Scaling at lower levels will occur in a similar manner to max level. WarcraftDevs 

Transmogrification
Is it safe to sell/delete some of the transmog items? Are they already stored on account or have to wait for launch ?
Outside of quest reward items, you'll want to wait until the transmog system is available in-game before you delete any gear. WarcraftDevs 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Why did the RTS genre die?
I have a lot of thoughts here, but I want to caveat that this is mostly anecdotal and not backed up by data.

First, and probably most importantly, I think Warcraft 3 started a trend that continued with the MOBAs to focus on micromanagement of a single hero rather than micromanagement of an entire economy. A lot of players clearly found the single-character-focus satisfying. RTS games became MOBAs the same way dinosaurs became birds.

Second, back in the RTS heydey, I felt like there were a lot of large games being played on LANs in offices and colleges. Perhaps due to esports, but certainly due to Starcraft 2, the focus drifted more to one-on-one games. Age of Empires was at its best in 3v3 or 4v4, which lent itself well to a lot of casual multiplayer

Third, it used to be more possible to compete in an RTS as a strategic player who made smart decisions and not just a twitch player with good reflexes. To be pro, you need to be good at both, but it's hard to even have much fun these days if you're bad at micro.

Fourth, back in the RTS heydey, you might meet someone, find out they play the same RTS as you, and agree to play together sometime. In later years, you'd quickly realize you were radically different ELOs and just say "Oh." To be fair, this happens in MOBAs as well, but the 5v5 nature helps a little there.

Fifth, I think over time the games just lived out their lifespan. There was such a leap in complexity of everything -- strategies, unit design, counter units, systems -- that it was difficult for anyone but pretty hardcore players to keep up. Yet, if they hadn't keep adding those systems, the engaged players might have gotten bored. I keep hoping that it feels like it's time for RTS as a genre to come back. Not yet.

Finally, I think it is easier to consume the content in an RTS. The developers can try to throw interesting maps or cool hooks at you in single-player, but you're going to see all of the units and buildings pretty quickly in multiplayer. MMOs can continually offer you new things to explore and enemies to fight. MOBAs add new champions. An RTS had to wait for a massive expansion, that in turn added to the bloat I mentioned in #5. 

I miss the storytelling of RTS campaigns. RPGs dont do the big stories as well imo
On WoW, I occasionally wished for Warcraft 4, just because it would give us such fertile ground for new stories. OccupyGStreet 

So you agree that RTS died? so sc2 confirmed daed gaem?
It's more that 10 years ago there were like 20 RTS franchises. Now there are a couple. OccupyGStreet 
Maybe "dead" is too strong and that came from the questioner. But the RTS field is much smaller than when I first got into it. OccupyGStreet 

interesting thoughts - what do you think would have happened if MOBAS were introduced prior to RTS?
I do think RTS delivers a particular experience you're the commander in a way few other genres can do well. OccupyGStreet 
4X games make you feel like a leader, but the battlefield is much more shallow IMO. The rest of the experience is deeper though OccupyGStreet 
So maybe RTS would have doubled down on that aspect -- less about the hero on the field and more about the soldiers. Shrug. OccupyGStreet 

Isn't the ideal MMO where all content is always relevant in some way and new content is icing on the cake?
IDK. Some sense of progression is nice too. I don't need to be running Keep on the Borderlands when I am 20th level. OccupyGStreet
