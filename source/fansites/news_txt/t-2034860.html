Achievement - Fashionista: Shirt<br>
When looking at the initial data from players that had a Fashionista achievement, we saw that only 20% of the players that had one of the achievements had the Fashionista: Shirt (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10691-fashionista-shirt) achievement. Complete all of the Fashionista achievements to earn Fabulous (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10694-fabulous), which rewards the Fabulous (http://www.wowdb.com/titles/477-the-fabulous) title!<br>
<br>
We will take a look at progress on these achievements in a week or two, after everyone has had a chance to finish them up. <br>

holy pally doesn&apos;t get 2H-Wep with pre-patch, even though new kit and upcoming artifact are built around that?<br>
Some artifacts (such as Holy Paladin) are meant to break some of the normal &quot;rules,&quot; but aren&apos;t needed at level 100. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/755516279746801664))<br>
<br>
Battlegrounds<br>
Please bring back the engineer glider/belt for unrated bgs. <br>
These will be back (for unrated BGs only) in a future patch. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/755825422449770496))<br>
<br>
Camera Zoom<br>
Please don&apos;t let this issue continue to go unaddressed: https://t.co/Eu8daLDTHE (&amp; all related threads)<br>
To be clear, it&apos;s absolutely something we care deeply about. Of course we want everyone to be able to enjoy the game. But zoom... (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/755829241011404800))<br>
...distance may have been a bandaid that masked underlying causes of motion sickness. We want to identify and fix those directly. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/755829504510230529))<br>

Items<br>
people clicking disenchant when people are greeding for offspec gear. would it not be better for a option asking if the player<br>
Need/Greed now strictly prioritizes mainspec &gt; offspec on Need, for reference; Greed is literally just &quot;I want to sell this.&quot; (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/755895983209189377))<br>
<br>
UI<br>
Hey, the low health screen flash could be a legitimate epilepsy issue. Disabling it -needs- to be put back in the menu.<br>
The option to disable it wasn&apos;t removed! It&apos;s just been moved to the &quot;Combat&quot; category. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/755509502590324737))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Can anyone C/D if Mists content gets the legacy buff when legion goes out? WarcraftDevs<br>
There&apos;s no such thing as a &quot;legacy buff&quot; - it was a one-time adjustment to content flattened out by the 6.0 squish. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/755230416995356672))<br>
so Mists content wont get easier once I hit 110? :C<br>
It certainly will, because you&apos;ll have several times more health and damage output after leveling and gearing up. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/755232618971475968))<br>
