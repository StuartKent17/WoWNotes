Ability Consolidation and Refinement

Thick Hide http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/16931 has been removed and its effects have been incorporated into Bear Form http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5487 for Guardian Druids.

Bear Form http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5487 now increases armor by 600% 330% for all Druid specializations, and no longer increases Haste and Critical Strike from items by 50%, but instead causes Haste to reduce the global cooldown
For Guardian Druids, Bear Form http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5487 now also reduces magical damage taken by 25%, reduces physical damage taken by 12%, reduces chance to be critically hit by 6%, and reduces chance for attacks to be parried by 3%.

Tiger’s Fury is now usable during Berserk http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/106952.


Summary of changes to Balance:
That's the basics of the new Moonkin rotation. There’s room for improvement beyond that, learning to optimally maintain both periodic damage effects while maximizing their damage with the strongest Eclipse http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/79577 effect, timing Starsurge http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78674 to optimize the benefit of its buff, make use of Starfall http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/48505 and Hurricane http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/42231 for area damage, and taking advantage of the strengths of each side such as Moonfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921 and Sunfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402 having significant differences now. Here are the full details of the changes.

Details of changes to Balance:

Eclipse http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/79577 has been redesigned.

The damage of damage-over-time effects changes dynamically as Eclipse http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/79577 changes.

Moonfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921 now has a base duration of 20 seconds up from 14 seconds, but is no longer extended by Starfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/2912 and Starsurge http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78674 critical strikes. Upon reaching 100 Lunar Energy, the next Moonfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921 deals 100% additional initial damage.
Sunfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402 is no longer its own spell and replaces Moonfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921 on the action bar whenever Balance Energy is on the Solar side. Sunfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402 now has a base duration of 24 20 seconds up from 14 seconds, but is no longer extended by Wrath http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5176 and Starsurge http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78674 critical strikes. Enemies may still suffer from both Moonfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921 and Sunfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402’s periodic damage components simultaneously. Upon reaching 100 Solar Energy, the next Sunfire http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402 deals 100% additional initial damage.


Restoration Changes

Omen of Clarity http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/113043 Restoration can now only be triggered by the most recently applied Lifebloom http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/94447, and now causes the next Regrowth http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8936 to be free.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage
Talent Revisions

Ice Ward http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/111264 was changed to make it more competitive with the rest of its talent row. Ice Ward http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/111264 now causes the next 3 attackers up from 1 to trigger a Frost Nova http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/122.


One of the most problematic Talent rows in the game has been the Mage level-90 row. The primary theme of the row was mana, which only Arcane Mages actually cared about. Bonus damage was added in, making it functional for all Mages, but muddled in its goals. Additionally, some of them just weren't fun to play with. We've revised the row to be purely about damage, and made them have less maintenance cost. Arcane Mages will have enough mana regeneration without these Talents to perform well.


Mirror Image http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/55342 is now a level-90 Talent, replacing Invocation http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/114003. Mirror Image http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/55342 now inherit 100% 50% of the Mage’s Spell Power up from 5%, last 40 seconds up from 30 seconds, and have a 2 minutes cooldown down from 3 minutes.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin 
Ability Consolidation and Refinement
There were a few mergers of passive abilities, and some tweaks to a couple of abilities.

Redemption http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/7328’s mana cost has been reduced by 95%.
Selfless Healer http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/85804 no longer causes Bastion of Glory to apply to Flash Heal http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/2061.


Protection Changes
For Protection, we tweaked Eternal Flame http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/114163 in order to reduce its massive self-healing amount, and provide better balance between talents on that row. We also added a new passive, Shining Protector, in order to give defensive value to the new Multistrike stat. Holy Wrath http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/119072’s damage and cooldown were also increased, and Sanctified Wrath http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/53376 changed to buff it further, in order to give Protection Paladins more burst threat and damage, while retaining its core damage-splitting identity.


Holy Wrath http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/119072’s damage has been increased by 100%, and its cooldown increased to 15 seconds up from 9 seconds.
Sanctified Wrath http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/53376 for Protection Paladins has been redesigned.

Sanctified Wrath http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/53376 Protection now increases the damage of Holy Wrath http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/119072 by 100% and causes it to generate 1 Holy Power.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock 
Demonology Changes
We were unsatisfied with Grimoire of Sacrifice http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/108503 for Demonology. Fundamentally, it did not fit Demonology’s theme to sacrifice their pet, full time. We had toyed with ideas where it acted as a temporary cooldown for Demonology, but have decided to replace it with a new talent, which is more theme-appropriate, and fits well against the competition in that talent row.


Grimoire of Sacrifice http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/108503 is no longer available to Demonology Warlocks and has a new talent, Grimoire of Synergy in its place.

Grimoire of Synergy: When the Warlock or their demon deals damage, there is a chance to trigger Demonic Synergy, granting the other one 15% increased damage for 15 seconds.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior 
Ability Consolidation and Refinement

Thunder Clap http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/115799 now costs 15 30 Rage, and also reduces the movement speed of nearby enemies by 50% for 6 sec.
Ultimatum http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/122509’s effects have been merged into baseline Shield Slam http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/23922.


Fury Changes
Fury Warriors received a few additional changes. In particular, Heroic Strike http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78 has been removed for Fury Warriors, and modified Wild Strike http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/100130 to fill the role of quick excess Rage dump. We also made a revision to the Critical Strike chance of Bloodthirst http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/23881 to make them less crit-dependant. A new glyph has been added which gives Fury Warriors a choice for a notably different playstyle. Auto attack damage had become too high, so we also moved some damage from that into Execute http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5308 which has been changed to deal damage based on Weapon Damage, instead of just Attack Power. In order to make sure that you’re able to spend all of your resources within each Colossus Smash http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/86346 window, we added an extension to it onto Raging Blow http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/96103. Plus, we've updated some to spell alerts to improve usability.


Raging Blow http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/96103 now extends the duration of Colossus Smash http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/86346 by 2 seconds, and has a spell alert on the left and right slots.
