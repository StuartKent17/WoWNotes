I believe it was Ion that said in a dev chat movement abilities were coming back off the GCD. So is this actually happening?
This is something that is still happening. Here is the list I have so far of abilities that are for sure coming off the GCD:

Havoc - Vengeful Retreat
All Druids - Wild Charge
Arms - Charge
Fury - Charge
Protection Warrior - Ignore Pain
Protection Warrior – Intercept
Protection Warrior PvP – Dragon Charge
Survival – Harpoon Source https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/37795/8


Well that’s nice I guess, what about all the other categories?
This is just what we have confirmed so far. There could potentially be more added to the list, but I personally just don’t know of any others yet.

We’d love to hear from you guys on more examples of abilities that you feel should be off the GCD and why. Source https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/37795/17
