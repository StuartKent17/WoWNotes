You’ve fought on the shores of Kul Tiras, explored the far corners of Zandalar, and faced the enemy at every turn. You survived the Battle of Dazar’alor, and aided Magni Bronzebeard in his critical quest to save Azeroth from her grievous wound. Soon, your journey will take you into the depths of Nazjatar and the wonders of Mechagon, where even more dangers await—but you don’t have to face them all from ground level. Once you complete the account-wide achievement Battle for Azeroth Pathfinder, Part 2, you’ll be able to take to the skies . . . and earn a brand-new mechanical mount in the process!
