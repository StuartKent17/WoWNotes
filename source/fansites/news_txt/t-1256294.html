Patch 5.2 Legendary Quests Updated<br>
A recent PTR build updated the description of many of the legendary quests. Check out the quest pages to read the entire description for each quest, especially A Reckoning (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32598-a-reckoning)!<br>
<br>
The new additions show that you need to unlock several phases of the War Effort, as well as kill the new world boss, Storm Lord Nalak (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/839-Nalak-The-Storm-Lord-Pandaria).<br>

There aren&apos;t really any significant changes to Lunar Festival this year, just keep in mind that you can grab the other faction&apos;s pet by making a character on that faction or purchasing it from the AH.<br>

How much have you been hearing about the 400+ ilvl gear on 80&apos;s? Will this be fixed soon? Or intended to be??<br>
A lot, yes and no. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288486044846915586))<br>

I know Hit &amp; Run is DOA, but are you guys at all surprised by the amount of positive reaction we saw from some PTR players?<br>
Honestly, yes. The targeting reticule was a deal-breaker for many of our internal folks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289823528503615490))<br>
really, the targetting reticule was the killer? Maybe we can talk about HLeap<br>
Heroic Leap played into the decision. We like the ability (and so do many warriors) but for some the reticule is a hard sell. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289832356611768320))<br>
<br>
Any plans to still balance&amp;nerf healer mana in 5.2? Pallys and Discs hardly go OOM anymore making spirit a less valuable stat.<br>
We see paladins go OOM. Disc avoids it with Rapture games that aren&apos;t available in 5.2. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289791730834878464))<br>
What about resto druids? Mages? They never oom<br>

What do you think is the reason(s) that vast majority of the warrior population plays arms in pvp compared to fury?<br>
Big hits &gt; many hits in PvP. Enrage can be dispelled. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289548617050632192))<br>
so, rogues are many hits class, change them plz<br>
If the damage of all melee has about the same &quot;cadence&quot; doesn&apos;t that hurt class diversity? Rerolling should be exciting. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289787283647913984))<br>

Is the Vengeance hotfix permanent? Or just until you fix the recalc bugs?<br>

You&apos;ve said WoW cannot support an infinite number of classes.With DK and now Monks added will we ever see a Demon Hunter class<br>

10/5% is indeed unacceptable. 1% delta is fine. And need to switch specs for single vs. multi-target encounters is same bs.<br>
I suspect 1% is unachievable on actual diverse encounters so long as specs use different buttons. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288500869119496192))<br>

I think there are very few ferals out there who actually wanted this monotone non-shifting gameplay.<br>
That one is really tough. Some druids like the shifting aspect of the class, other say &quot;No, I am a cat. Period.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289143102961242113))<br>

Resto Druids got hurt so bad with the increased Battle Fatigue. Troubling you still think them on par with RS/Pala. Explain?<br>
If everyone&apos;s healing goes down by the same percentage, how does one healer get hurt more? Relative healing should stay the same. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288087508657520640))<br>
When healing was higher it let the druid hot then do other things like cyclone/pounce. Now he has to hardcast more.<br>
But if the shaman&apos;s heals are 30% smaller too, why do they not have to heal more as well? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288090075735142401))<br>

If you want mages to play the spec they want. Why have the devs made fire mage so poor on single target dps? any changes inc?<br>
All the raiding mages were Fire BC Fire was best in every situation. Now we see more Frost and Arcane, but still lots of Fire. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288002799214657536))<br>
the Player like to play Fire, but why you dont want it, you nerfed it to the ground on singelataget?<br>
Last I looked, Fire is 90 to 100K on a single target fight like Feng. That&apos;s to the ground these days? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288101614613565443))<br>
try looking at the average players not the top raiders. avg player is at 40-60<br>
And isn&apos;t Arcane around there as well? Or maybe a better question: what is not to the ground for normal players? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288104687025135616))<br>
http://t.co/lEbr21Sy ist this not the ground?<br>
Stack ranks are deceptive. Try this: compare just Fire and Arcane. Now compare sample size and standard deviation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288109824560988160))<br>
<br>
arcane is around there frost Im seeing still low overall 30 - 43 I track this to lack of FoF proc chance on bosses. look into?<br>
Hard to say for Frost. Sample size is low, and my guess is most raiding mages are Fire/Arcane. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288107969059618817))<br>

Fun? Not sure. Interesting? B/C scorch adds a bit more decision making to rotation.<br>

Have you ever considered that not many people roll monk because of the burdens of keeping up an alt or levelling one<br>
Yeah that is certainly an issue. When I say monks are low in PvP, that considers their already low population overall. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288415814078590976))<br>
<br>
How do you feel mistweaver monks are in terms of raid utility compared to other healers? There isn&apos;t a goto reason to take one<br>

why did you take repentance, an iconic ret tool, and made it bad for rets and placed it in a awkward talent tier?<br>
We wanted less instant CC (still do) and knew cast time would be hard sell for Ret, so we&apos;d let them opt out of it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288716263545516032))<br>
<br>
I feel if you removed HoTR from Ret AoE DPS and replaced it with Divine Storm our AoE Rotation would feel better. <br>
When we had Divine Storm in the &quot;builder&quot; role before, its damage was puny and Rets asked for it to hit harder. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288419622364016641))<br>

Why did you give 50 energy for rogues in tier bonus ? IMO it means OP for sub, 5+ amb. Do you think energy is a big problem ?<br>
We were trying to give them more burst for PvP (ironically they needed it) but considering +30 instead. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289520986238357504))<br>
<br>
On rogue &quot;fun&quot; levels.Imo theyfeel maintenancey.Keep up SnD,Rupture,Enven.Takes away the feel of the actual attacks you use<br>
Maybe Slice and Dice should only be one spec? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288110721248661505))<br>
<br>
Also, to reiterate, it&apos;s fine for Combat to be better at cleaving. We just want to tone it down so you can be e.g. Ass / Sub. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288093390334214144))<br>
Bring them up to par with combat not nerf rogues only viable cleave into the ground. Does this not register?<br>
Rogues are doing well on almost every fight. The problem we&apos;re trying to solve is promoting diversity not giving out more DPS. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288105508085321728))<br>
So instead of giving rogues 3 legitimate choices when faced with a cleave heavy fight we get 3 mediocre choices. Great logic.<br>
Why don&apos;t you tell me the DPS delta that defines legit vs. mediocre for you? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288110048876568576))<br>
<br>
I&apos;m talking about sub spec, the buff of sanguinary veins (16%==&gt;20%) is not enough to be competitive. Hemorraghe need a buff<br>
Hard to say. If you look at a fight like Feng, Sub isn&apos;t far behind even though the sample size is much smaller. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288095303998001153))<br>
you mean subtlety?<br>
Yes, my bad. He said Sanguinary Vein buff. I heard Vitality buff. Both were intended to close the gap. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288094290633187328))<br>

Will you compensate the loss from Blade Flurry (Combat rogues) somehow? There are still people who prefer combat over sub<br>
We buffed Combat single target to make them more competitive with Assassination. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288004364038197249))<br>
since its damage is reduced so much will you be removing or reducing the energy generation penalty?<br>

Could make CS not affect HS, but then a lot of warriors have some relearning to do. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288050586539159552))<br>
I think the solution is in changing WS, not in breaking something that works well (heroic strike).<br>

I thought the intent was to just beat HS (like Slam does) except in rage bleed-offs? Does it not accomplish that?<br>
That is the intent, but it sounds like Fury just ignores the BS proc often, which is unfortunate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288088573314465792))<br>
It is low dmg and awkward to use. Making it proc a stronger free WS might be too similar to new Overpower though.<br>
WS is always going to be low priority compared to all else but we can try to make Bloodsurge worth using. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288499354615046144))<br>
<br>
Make the bloodsurge proc give WS a .5s GCD so you can get all 3 in one GCD and squeez it in there. Nerf it&apos;s damage.<br>
The game can&apos;t handle GCDs that low very well. Lag would be a killer. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288102965238169600))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Devs have spent more time defending this poor choice and not fixing it.<br>
Well, yeah, why wouldn&apos;t we defend a decision that we are unlikely to change? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289794861002010624))<br>
pve dungeons for rep to get pve gear makes sense your statement about dungeons for pvp gear makes you look stupid.<br>
The point was dungeons offer epics and valor. Why do they also need to offer additional bonuses? They are rewarding already. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289828140879060994))<br>
<br>
if 5.2 has no new 5-mans but new PvP honor gear, won`t it be the only consistent gearing for pve players too?<br>
You can use Honor gear. You can also run 5.0 LFR or earn valor to purchase items. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289114117200027648))<br>
<br>
Hey are the increased T14LFR droprates in 5.2 affecting elder charms&apos; rates? What about normal/heroic T14?<br>
Elder charms: yes, for LFR. For normal and heroic, probably not, but that isn&apos;t set in stone. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289786876339032065))<br>
<br>
Why are there such large ilevel gaps between tiers? Wouldn&apos;t smaller gaps make catching up easier?<br>
Raid balance works best when skilled groups can go in with lower ilevels and the rest of us can slowly improve our gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289506427737866240))<br>
<br>
Wait... Your current, throw patches at us like candy... is exactly against this mentality.<br>
Subtle difference: ToC invalidated Ulduar very quickly. We hope the 5.2 raid doesn&apos;t do that. You can keep running 5.0. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288713200575340545))<br>
But it will though. The desire for better loot will invalidate previous content. Has been like that since Wrath.<br>
Why wasn&apos;t it like that before Wrath? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288769344375246848))<br>
Because there was no catch-up system. But u said that we can catch-up LFR 5.2. in LFR 5.0. No reason for N/H<br>
So we&apos;ll shoot for a catch up mechanism that isn&apos;t as brutal as SSC-&gt;BT but not as fast as Ulduar-&gt;ToC. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289141205919469569))<br>
<br>
I disagree, the LFR system is trying to get the game to decide loot drops, not the players.<br>
Yes, that&apos;s the goal. It is sad to lose the ability to be kind but worth it to avoid loot drama among strangers. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289101434711048192))<br>
<br>
in regards to the random LFR loot, ever thought of giving a &quot;pass&quot; on loot so that the system chooses the next player?<br>
As soon as we do that, players are going to start begging you to pass because of course they deserve an item more than you. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288716927717744641))<br>
<br>
Will you stop trying to make us like dungeons/raiding with strangers, when that isn&apos;t remotely the draw, anytime soon?<br>
I think they will ALWAYS be more fun with friends. Your friends aren&apos;t always online or willing to go with you though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288716030933598209))<br>
<br>
Control factor. Prev system rewarded social grps rolling as team, and solos wrnt hindered. Now it&apos;s always same loot % as solo<br>
You mean a social LFR could feed gear to one player to gear them up faster? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288100997434318848))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
friend of mine just asked me about putting back vengeance in pvp. would that be possible? not the same way but an amount?<br>
Pretty unlikely TBH. Tanks already have good damage reduction and control in PvP. They don&apos;t need punishing DPS as well. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289503606904856576))<br>
<br>
Do you balance the game for 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, bgs or what?<br>
We try for everything, but place the most emphasis on 3v3 and BGs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289109708755849216))<br>
<br>
I told friends about Cata. MoP I preface with &quot;you&apos;re not viable until your 4th week of PVP cuz no pvp weapon&quot;<br>
Did you have Honor weapons in Cataclysm? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288767365573902338))<br>
<br>
Have you considered making all loss of control share the same DR? It may reduce comp restrictions &amp; cc balance problems.<br>
Talked about this some last week or so. The downside is it might take away some of the skill and knowledge PvP players like. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288707955279396864))<br>
<br>
DKs need strang on 1 min cd, no rune cost and off gcd, 30 sec cd on gnaw and amz baseline. No positional req. Class fixed? :-)<br>
Are more silences what PvP really needs? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288101752685867009))<br>
<br>
If it was decided to make WoW only based around PvP balance and absolutely nothing else, would pets still be included?<br>
Great question. I&apos;m not sure. Would depend on if classes felt different enough without them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288088931591929856))<br>
<br>
Character<br>
And wasn&apos;t it one of the main slogans of MOP - free us from being locked on mains only?<br>
You&apos;re asking more (I assume) to be able to play main and all alts without having to play a lot more than you did in Cataclysm? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288055738574729216))<br>
We didn&apos;t want to prevent you from switching mains because you&apos;d lose an achievement. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288055565060538369))<br>
<br>
That wont hurt game just because you&apos;ll still have to grind rep at least once.<br>
Can&apos;t you make the same argument about leveling up or even earning Valor? The basic question is what % faster should an alt take? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288765353054588928))<br>
<br>
The problem is the pace that players used to play to be able to keep up is not even close to current requirement<br>
Used to from when? Cataclysm didn&apos;t ask players to play much... and they didn&apos;t. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288020637157560320))<br>
<br>
Thank god for no upgradeable gear in 5.2. Hope it stays out forever. <br>
I tried to be careful to say that was the plan at the moment. It isn&apos;t set in stone. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288018052069593088))<br>
<br>
If you allow players to transmog outside of weapon-type, doesn&apos;t that sort of defeat the purpose of weapon-type to begin with?<br>
What is the purpose of weapon type these days? There used to be warrior talents etc. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288000846459965440))<br>
<br>
Sites like noxxic, EJ, IV and you&apos;ll see the benefit we TC&apos;s bring. Look at the wow forums, what benefits do the whiners bring<br>
Humor me. How does theorycrafting make the game more fun (excluding the people who enjoy geeking out on the numbers)? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287669691122606081))<br>
Because its otherwise not possible to determine how to properly gear up -&gt; play at the limit.<br>
If we thought that was extremely important, then we (the devs) could just tell you and not make you figure it out. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287735762840080384))<br>
<br>
So upgrading items is just a waste of time and effort. What is the point of it if it doesnt help in new raid even?<br>
I would think having higher ilevel would help a lot in the new content and will compete for a time with newer gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287720473557614592))<br>
still no answer if VP will be reset/downgraded like in the past on 5.2&apos;s release?<br>
I don&apos;t believe we have answered that yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287735100681113600))<br>
<br>
What are your thoughts on balancing 25m vs 10m healing? Seems like the biggest challenge among the 3 class roles.<br>
In brief, it&apos;s hard to overheal in 25, which makes AE spamming feasible, which means healers can use fewer buttons. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287733834684973056))<br>
<br>
If you&apos;re spending valor on upgrading old items instead of buying new items you&apos;re probably doing it wrong.<br>
Right and we don&apos;t want it to be a complex math / probability problem about whether upgrading or buying is better. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289823145773391873))<br>
So we ARE getting catch-up gear via VP in 5.2 (was under the impression LFR was the only route we got to catch up)<br>
Planning on new valor gear. Some (not all) may require reps. LFR is another avenue, but also gated. Catch up - yes. Instant - no. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289833051599556610))<br>
<br>
You aren&apos;t happy with how it&apos;s playing out atm? Is it because players are feeling pressure to VP cap to min/max?<br>
No, it&apos;s really that having valor for upgrade and valor for gear at the same time creates stressful decisions. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289831177588703232))<br>
<br>
Why is every design decision in MoP designed to make alts take more and more time to play? lvling rep gearing all anti-alt.<br>
In fact, many players made alts at the end of Cat because they were bored. Alts are cool, but shouldn&apos;t be mandatory to have fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289829083485962240))<br>
That isn&apos;t actually why those decisions were made. They were made so that a player with one character doesn&apos;t get bored. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289828984739483650))<br>
<br>
Are you content with people going from 4pc tX to 4pc tY? Rather than using tY at 2pc.<br>
You give up a lot of stat points to use an old set bonus (waiting until 4 like you said). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289504827795460096))<br>
<br>
At last BlizzCon someone asked about tabards and bank space consumption. Anything being done there? I realize it&apos;s a big task.<br>
We recognize the problem and agree we made it worse by adding so many toys. We have some ideas, but nothing to announce yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289144631747309569))<br>
<br>
I&apos;m playing much less now with boring dailies and always-out-of-reach valor cap. Feels pointless, not fun.<br>
What if you just earned as much valor as you felt like and didn&apos;t target the cap. What if the cap was 20,000? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288511065606725632))<br>
<br>
Some of us like not spending every spare moment just to keep up. Is it really drop in subs that motivates design?<br>
It&apos;s similar to how we offer many difficulty levels in raids now. We have diverse players and try to support as many as we can. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288708639093571584))<br>
<br>
The only problem is that there are players who can only play 2-3 days a week - for us, catching up = impossible.<br>
How many weeks of playing 2-3 days is reasonable to spend on catch up? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288485257265680384))<br>
<br>
Rested Bonus applying to VP seems like a reasonable compromise. Could replace valor of ancients<br>
We&apos;ve considered that (and rep) but the game has no concept ATM of rest for anything beyond XP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288082475488534528))<br>
<br>
UI / Addons<br>
As an addon dev, im not against you protecting functions, but you need to give a way to interact with it. &quot;Req. User Input&quot;<br>
That&apos;s usually what we get around to doing. It just takes code time, which is time we can&apos;t spend on other features or bugs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287278949631934464))<br>
<br>
Dear GC, can you please make it so that Auto-loot is on by default. I have to change it every time I make a character.<br>
Not crazy about default, but we could save the variable per account instead of character perhaps. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288042905866731521))<br>
<br>
have you thought about adding some sort of mouseover heal setting, not just macroing everything?<br>
Yes, we&apos;ve considered it as an option, since it&apos;s a popular one. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/288019338752061440))<br>
<br>
I dont want to automate anything! MANY people cant change talents w/o freq reloading due to false addon errors!<br>
We are going to *try* in 5.2 to isolate the protection more so that innocent mods don&apos;t stumble into it as frequently. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289102842176876547))<br>
In addition to that, some more helpful debug info would really nice (e.g. stack traces of where the taint occurred)<br>
Talked about this some with the UI team today and they&apos;re going to try some things. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289520291829403648))<br>
Maybe the UI team should have dealt with UI instead of pokewow?<br>
Add-on authors always want access to more stuff and more power. We try to help them out as we can. WoW&apos;s UI is our main focus. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289792634950672384))<br>
<br>
Are there any plans to add some UI that allows you to track which +Rep Commendations you&apos;ve already purchased?<br>
Yes. 5.2 has such a feature. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289785548099444736))<br>
<br>
They aren&apos;t false errors. We understand that the mods may not always realize what they did to get the taint. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/289102676665442304))<br>
