Illegal Danish 2 - Escape from Orgrimmar<br>
Yup, it&apos;s here. Blame the 15% of Vista users on this site who won&apos;t let me embed the video because their OS can&apos;t handle it. ^^<br>

2.4 Information very soon<br>
This post is fairly interesting actually, it seems that the first batch of new information about the 2.4 patch will be posted very soon. (This week ?)<br>
While I understand players&apos; frustrations about the dearth of information, please keep in mind that we can&apos;t always dictate that is announced when. There are factors such as development progress, release coordination, and such.<br>
<br>
For the Community team, our current focus is to bring you more information about the upcoming 2.4 patch. There are several features in there that we think you will love, and we want to get that information out once we are back in the office.<br>

Death Knight<br>
A few more details on the Death Knight, nearly the same as usual but according to this post it seems that the primary role of the DK will be tanking, not damage dealing. (That&apos;s not really a surprise, they&apos;re some kind of Dark Paladins after all)<br>
The death knight will be a tank/dps class. Currently there is an under-representation of tank classes, so the decision was made add a tank class to balance the class representation. A great quote that the dev team mentions is that the Death Knight is &quot;epic but equal,&quot; meaning the experience is meant to be epic, but the death knight will be the equal of other classes. Otherwise there would be an over-representation of tanks and not enough healers and dps in the world.<br>

Molten Core completed with 3 players<br>
So ... you&apos;re feeling like you wasted your time in game during holidays ? Well, some people are worse than you, and decided it would be fun to run Molten Core with ... 3 level 70 players. That&apos;s time wasting, useless, but damn it&apos;s impressive and this is how you do it :<br>
Lucifron: priest, druid, hunter (pet acting as a foil for the adds&apos; mind control; the curse was dealt with by me shifting out of bearform to decurse when it got applied, and then shifting back in)<br>
Magmadar: priest, druid, hunter (because we were there, really; hunter also occasionally tranq-shotted Magmadar&apos;s Frenzy, I believe - I didn&apos;t exactly check, I was too busy trying to avoid getting feared into conflags)<br>
Gehennas: priest, mage, warrior (itty bitty feral druid mana pool + curse needing removed immediately = disaster, so I couldn&apos;t quite have tanked that particular fight - so the warrior tanked it, and I decursed / DPS&apos;d as a mage... as it was, I ended up having to chain mana potions to keep on top of it; we failed once due to me getting shadowbolted right after running out of rain of fire)<br>
Garr to Golemagg: priest, mage, warrior (because we were there, really - did it all in one clear, one-shotted the lot of them)<br>
Sulfuron to Ragnaros: priest, druid, warrior (for pretty obvious reasons; large amounts of adds meant we wanted two tanks)<br>

Addon - AutoProfitX<br>
Another addon today, probably the simplest I ever posted. <br>
<br>
AutoProfitX (http://files.wowace.com/AutoProfitX/AutoProfitX.zip) will sell all the gray items in your inventory just by pushing a button when you&apos;re talking to a vendor, you can also have it sell selected white items. Try it, and you&apos;ll never play without it again. <br>
