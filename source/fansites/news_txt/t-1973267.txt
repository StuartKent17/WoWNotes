Legion - Additional 3D Armor Pieces
In Legion, some armor sets will finally have additional 3D pieces, rather than the few limited shapes per piece that have been used in the past. Currently these are mostly used on the Tier 19 / PvP armor sets. These new pieces have to be modified for each race and gender, similar to helms. 

Keep in mind that this is an early preview and not finished artwork!
