A few hours ago, Vanquish http://vanquish-guild.com/main/ US-Staghelm managed to take down all 3 bosses of the Vault of Archavon within one minute and was the first guild in the world to complete the Earth, Wind & Fire 10 Player http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4016/earth-wind-fire-10-player/ achievement. Congratulations to them!
