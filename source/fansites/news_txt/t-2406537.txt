World Quest UI Changes - Battle for Azeroth
In Battle for Azeroth, it will be significantly more effort to group for World Quests due to new restrictions on what addons can do with the Group Finder. 


The default UI no longer offers the option to find a group for non-elite quests. The option is still there for Elite quests.
Addons can no longer automatically create groups, even with a user pressing the button. The title and description can only be manually filled out.
Users will have to manually add a title and create a group for world quests. You can't even paste text into the fields.
Addons can still search for groups.

Demonologyâ€™s Felguard is intended to be a uniquely strong pet that only they have access to. They favor it over the other pets, but swapping for utility is still an option where needed. https://t.co/THA64ZoFM5 WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1004160699684147200
