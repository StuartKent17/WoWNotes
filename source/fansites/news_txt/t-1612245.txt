Raid Loot Downgrading
1. This shouldn't happen any longer, so going forward, the items downgrading themselves should be fixed. If you see it happen in a fresh circumstance, please let us know immediately.

2. For those that have had mythic items downgrade themselves, please open a petition with the exact item name.

Our ticket volume is a bit larger than normal, so it may take a little while to get to all requests, but we will work through these as quickly as possible. Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14881728786?page=2#36

Thok Dropping Higher Quality Gear Than Intended
Thok is also bugged with this gear issue. Last night in normal, he dropped all mythic gear. The night before in normal, he dropped all heroic.
We're aware of that issue with Thok. Enjoy the upgrades in the meanwhile. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344817-mythic-warforged-item-becomes-normal-version/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14880818443?page=6#101

Iron Starlette Noise
The cute little guy sure can project! We're aware and tracking a couple different bugs with the Iron Starlette's audio. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/345225-iron-starlette-noise/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14881058232?page=3#54

Secondary Stat Attunements as a "Guideline not a rule" is not what I expected. Is the goal for the design not to make this work
For some specs, especially tanks and healers, different stats are situationally more or less valuable. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/521833727370858496
Attunements being a guideline, not a rule, is the intended design. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/521833865443168258
what about specs where the attuned stat is your worst in 90% of situations?
That's not ideal, and we hope to improve upon them in the future. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/521850963376615424

Is there any way we can get DoT tooltips on targets to update dynamically to reflect the changes to snapshotting?
It's an issue that we're aware of, but is quite a big undertaking. Working on it for the future. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/521847972904980480

Character / Items
If I pug Sha of Pride on personal loot, would all 30 people have to wait for their turn to open the box to see if they got loot?
Thankfully, no. It may have taken 10 years, but we solved the "chest already being used" issue, at least for personal loot. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522038072196620289

will the Dark Shaman set be able to drop still once warlords hits
Yes. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522131899976654848

Proving Grounds
The "You're really doing it wrong" was NOT retroactive like you said it would be. Any incoming fix?
Unfortunately, we were not able to make it retroactive. Only the level 100 Feat of Strength will be available. Apologies. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/522103373877616640

PvE
why did the ordos cloak change get reverted? kinda disappointed
I believe it was a technical issue. We are sad about it, too. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/522135698409680897

PvP
for below max-level characters, will skirmishes scale player numbers up to bracket maximum like bgs do?
yes it will holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522063122924703745


Free Character Migrations FCM 17/10
The following Free Character Migrations are scheduled to be available until 23 October, 2014. They are all open for both factions:

PvE Realms
Draenor -> Emerald Dream, Shadowsong
Silvermoon -> Azjol-Nerub, Khadgar

PvP Realms
Kazzak / Stormscale / Ragnaros / Twisting Nether -> Darksorrow, Auchindoun

RP Realms
Argent Dawn -> Moonglade, Darkmoon Faire

If you wish to discuss an FCM for a specific realm, the dedicated discussion threads are linked above.

Please note that FCMs are opened based on realm population tracking and analysis, not by request. If you’re looking for a specific migration from realm A to realm B, you should in most cases use the Character Transfer service. Although we will try to avoid doing so without giving notice in advance, these FCMs may be closed before the scheduled date.

Character Transfers CT
All realms follow the regular CT rules, found here http://eu.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_GB&articleId=20416.

Guild Transfers
Although Free Guild Master Realm Transfers are not possible at this time, the Free Character Migration will allow you to retain your guild membership and reputation, provided that the guild master completes a Guild Master Realm Transfer first and the faction remains the same as that of the source realm.
