Battle for Azeroth&#x2122; is approaching fast, and everyone is needed back on the front lines. This weekend, we&#x2019;re upgrading all inactive World of Warcraft accounts to grant returning players full access to the game* and all their characters&#x2014;without a subscription&#x2014;through June 24.<br>
<br>
Spread the Word!<br>
As the heroes of Azeroth prepare for war, they look to their in-game friends for help. Whether it&#x2019;s leveling up for experience, gearing up for combat, or mounting up to explore Azeroth, World of Warcraft is best enjoyed in groups, however big or small. If you have guildmates, friends, or family who haven&#x2019;t been seen in Azeroth for a while, let them know they can play for free this weekend! <br>

Upcoming Australian Dollar (AUD) Price Changes for Select World of Warcraft Services<br>
World of Warcraft is played in many regions around the world, and we regularly conduct reviews of the prices of our games and services in all currencies. From time to time, it&#x2019;s necessary to make changes to certain pricing based on a variety of factors, including global and regional market conditions. Following a careful evaluation, we wanted to provide notice that we&#x2019;ll soon be adjusting the Australian dollar (AUD) prices of some of the select services available for World of Warcraft.<br>
<br>
The new AUD pricing, reflected in the table below, will go into effect on 26 June AEST. Subscription prices will not be affected.<br>
<br>
New Zealand dollar pricing will be unaffected by this price change, and players in New Zealand will continue to purchase digital game software, virtual items, subscriptions, and optional game services at the current NZD pricing.<br>
<br>
We know that people have a lot of options for entertainment, and we never take pricing adjustments such as this lightly. We appreciate that players choose to spend their time with World of Warcraft, and we&#x2019;re committed to ensuring the game continues to provide Australian players with a great entertainment value. <br>
