We don't really have a lot of information on drop locations but we know a few things:



Savage Raptor http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/97581/savage-raptor/#13623/13682 will be a WoW TCG reward but doesn't have any model for the moment.
Amani Dragonhawk http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96503/amani-dragonhawk/ is also included in this patch and is also supposed to be a WoW TCG Reward but doesn't look like it has any final model either. 
Nightsaber Cub http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96819/nightsaber-cub/#13623/13682 will be a WoW TCG rewards but other versions of the panther cubs will be available through questing/rare drops apparently.
