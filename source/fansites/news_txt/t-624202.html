4 years ago, on November 23 2004, World of Warcraft was released in the United States. To commemorate this event any player who will connect in game today (from November 23 00:01 to 23:59 server time) will be rewarded with a Feat of Strength and a super-cute pet!<br>
<br>
Note: You will have to wait until November 23 in your timezone. <br>
