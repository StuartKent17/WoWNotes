One last thing, the background downloader is now downloading the first part of Patch 3.1. This isn't very surprising, according to this official post http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/15660807859-long-strange-trip-noblegarden-and-31.html, the current goal is to have the patch released at the beginning of April, however nothing is sure and devs are already thinking about the possibility to postpone the Noblegarden event if they can't make it on time.
