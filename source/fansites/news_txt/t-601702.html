<br>
Disclaimer: This thread and everything posted in it is still in development and is subject to change based on further development and testing.<br>
<br>
Northrend is the icy northern most continent of Azeroth. Formed during the War of the Ancients, and initially introduced in Warcraft III, players will be returning to it in The World of Warcraft Expansion: The Wrath of the Lich King.<br>
<br>
Geography:<br>
<br>
Northrend will have zones of a comparable size to those in outland, it will also have more zones, but the exact number has not been finalised yet.<br>
Players can start from two different zones: Howling Fjord &amp; Borean Tundra.<br>
<br>
Howling Fjord:<br>
Your first chance to go up against the ancient Vrykul in their instance Utgarde Keep.<br>
<br>
Borean Tundra:<br>
The home to the Tuskarr.<br>
Parts of Borean Tundra are being melted down for water by the Naga<br>
Garrosh Hellscream has established a base of operations at Warsong Hold.<br>
<br>
Grizzly Hills:<br>
The home of Furbolgs and their city of Grizzlemaw.<br>
Also home to the ancient Dwarven City of Thor Modan.<br>
The land is largely covered in forests - an example of our desire to make sure that not all zones are just snow and ice.<br>
<br>
Dragonblight:<br>
The home of Wyrmrest Temple, the ancient meeting place where dragons go to die.<br>
<br>
Lake Wintergrasp:<br>
A new non-instanced PvP zone with Siege Weapons, destructible buildings and multiple objectives with lasting effects. Players on Normal realms will automatically be flagged for PvP when entering this zone.<br>
<br>
The Storm Peaks:<br>
Containing Ulduar, the ancient Titan city in the Far North.<br>
<br>
Capital City:<br>
<br>
The Kirin Tor, led by Rhonin, have moved Dalaran to Northrend as a final front in their war against the Blue Dragon Flight. The Blue Dragon Flight, following a strengthened Malygos, are now attempting to purge all magic users from Azeroth.<br>
It will act as the central neutral city floating above Northrend - a Shattrath of the North.<br>
<br>
Races of Northrend:<br>
<br>
Taunka &#x2013; An ancient offshoot of the Tauren, who have a considerably different outlook on the world.<br>
Tuskarr &#x2013; The Nomadic Fisher Walrus men make a return from Warcraft III.<br>
Iron Dwarves &#x2013; There is a great deal to be discovered about the history of Azeroth through their story.<br>
Naga &#x2013; Pursuing their material interests further in Northrend.<br>
Vrykul &#x2013; The ancient giant vikings of the Howling Fjord<br>
Furbolgs &#x2013; The Furbolgs live in the city of Grizzlemaw in Grizzly Hills.<br>
Nerubians &#x2013; The Nerubian spiderlords are related to the silithid of Silithus and are followers of the Old Gods in Northrend.<br>
<br>
Famous Faces:<br>
<br>
Players will interact with Arthas right from the beginning in Northrend.<br>
Arthas is the avatar of the Lich King and is scheming to corrupt the players of the Horde and Alliance against their own people as he himself was corrupted against his own father by the Lich King.<br>
Every player, whether a raider or solo player, will have a hand in whether Arthas is defeated or whether he ultimately dominates the entire world.<br>
<br>
Garrosh Hellscream has moved to Northrend to lead the fight following in the steps of his father.<br>
Lady Sylvanas is leading the Forsaken with their experimental plague against the scourge and Arthas<br>
Highlord Bolvar Fordragon will be at the forefront of the campaign for the Alliance in a tumultuous storyline.<br>
Brann Bronzebeard is the consummate explorer and finally makes an appearance in World of Warcraft helping the dwarves explore their origins in Northrend.<br>
Tirion Fordring and The Order of the Silver Hand make a return, bringing with them the legend of the Ashbringer<br>
Rhonin is now leading the Kirin Tor in their war against the Blue Dragon Flight.<br>
<br>
PvP:<br>
<br>
There will be a new mid-sized (e.g. 15 vs 15) battleground in which the goal is to blow up the enemy base using Siege Weapons. (Not yet determined if this is actually located in Northrend.)<br>
<br>
There will be a new Arena Map and Season.<br>
<br>
A new non-instanced PvP zone, Lake Wintergrasp, will contain Siege Weapons, destructible buildings and multiple objectives with lasting effects. Players on Normal realms will automatically be flagged for PvP when entering this zone.<br>
