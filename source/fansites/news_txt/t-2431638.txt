Hoist sail and make way for Booty Bay because it’s Pirate’s Day!

Bring Your Sea Shanty to Booty Bay
Pirates have taken over the goblin town of Booty Bay and Captain DeMeza is recruiting any scurvy dog she can into her buccaneer ranks. Visit her or her henchmen in the capital cities if the pirate’s life is for you!

Feeling out of place in Booty Bay without a proper costume? Don’t worry. /Dance one little jig with the Dread Captain DeMeza and she’ll be impressed enough to press you into her crew and outfit you properly. If you get attached to your new look, you can do the quest You're Gonna Need A Bigger Boat! https://www.wowdb.com/quests/42758-youre-gonna-need-a-bigger-boat! Succeed, and you’ll get an Emergency Pirate Outfit https://www.wowdb.com/items/138414-emergency-pirate-outfit or five for when Pirate’s Day is but a distant memory and your inner pirate is clawing to get out.

What good is a pirate without an avian companion on their shoulder? Captain DeMeza for the exchange of a few shiny coins can help you call forth a temporary companion named Petey https://www.wowdb.com/items/138400-petey to take with you wherever you sail.

From time to time the captain will shout for a brave party to take on a terror of the deeps–an elite shark known as Ol' Eary https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/108715-ol-eary. Make sure you have a hearty crew with you or you could become just so much chum in the waters of the bay.

Join the Beach Party
Once you and your crew have helped the captain handle Ol’Eary, you can celebrate with the crew at a little beach party just south of Booty Bay. The exalted among the Bloodsail Buccaneers can also purchase a toy from Edward Techt https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/122396-edward-techt–the Jolly Roger https://www.wowdb.com/items/150547-jolly-roger-to show off their dedication to the cause.
