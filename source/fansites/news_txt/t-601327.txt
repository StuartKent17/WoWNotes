PvE players are starting to kill and loot tons of things in the Black Temple and PvP players don't have anything new to play with ! Luckily for you, a Blizzard employee was nice enough to make a post on the official forums, announcing the date of the season 2. 

The new season of the Arena should start the 12th June, and you should have enough time to finish leveling your warlock alt. 


We are currently planning to end the first season and begin Arena Season 2 on June 12, 2007 to coincide with a small patch. Please be aware that this may change to a later date if the patch is not in fact ready by the 12th. We will keep everyone updated if this date does change; however, June 12 is the earliest date that the second season can be expected to begin.

After re-evaluating the arena season process and player feedback we will now be resetting all arena team ratings at the start of the new season. Players will still retain their arena points and teams with this reset. The team rating will simply be reset to the default 1500, allowing all teams to once again compete for top honour with a fresh start.

With the end of the first season players who have contributed to at least 20% of the games in the top teams from each battlegroup will receive their end-of-season rewards. These include Arena-specific titles that they can display proudly until the end of the new season, and for the best of the best, an Armoured Nether Drake. New high end epic Arena rewards will also be added to coincide with the start of the second Arena Season, as well as new epic honour rewards.
