<br>
We might see more progress on Anub&apos;arak today now that a very annoying bug preventing guilds to access the boss after a soft reset has been hotfixed.<br>
A hotfix has been deployed that will prevent the instance from entering a bugged state where Barrett does not spawn after a soft reset. If you haven&apos;t gotten to Anub&apos;arak yet, you&apos;ll be fine now.<br>
<br>
For those of you already afflicted with this bug in your saved raid, I&apos;m still working on a method to correct the issue via hotfix for everyone so afflicted.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, our customer service staff has been informed how they can resolve the bug for a raid with a bugged instance.</div></div>
