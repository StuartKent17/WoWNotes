This Week in WoW History
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.

War Games
The start of Arena Season 9 brought the War Games feature to WoW. This new Arena and Battleground mode is a custom game which allows players to battle it out against another group. During these skirmishes no achievements, rankings, or stats are recorder, because they are meant to just be a fun feature allowing players to challenge and fight against each other. Perhaps the most common format to rise is the 5v5 1v1s, where two teams of five people take turns dueling until there is only one team standing.


  

Blizzard World of Color
The 2011 Blizzard holiday party was hosted at California Adventure, and the company delivered a special surprise. A Blizzard themed light show featured clips from Starcraft II, Diablo III, and World of Warcraft. Each show had a small comic bit followed by a trailer projected on the famous World of Color water fountain.


  

Reaper of Souls
Closed beta for Diablo III: Reaper of Souls opened, allowing players to opt into beta testing through their Battle.Net page for a chance at an invite. This was the first expansion pack for Diablo III, which was revealed at Gamescom in 2013. 


  

Highmaul Mythic Race
Imperator Mar’gok managed to live 5 days before being defeated by Paragon. Imperator Mar’gok’s secret phase brought back Cho’gall, who was defeated in the Bastion of Twilight during the Cataclysm.


  

Legion PvP Overhaul
Legion brought numerous changes to the PvP system, in an attempt to make it feel more rewarding. The most notable change was the addition of Honor Levels and Honor Talents. This new talent tree can be unlocked through doing PvP content that rewards Honor. These talents are only usable in PvP combat, however after unlocking all of them players could still advance their Honor Level to gain additional Prestige Levels unlocking cosmetic rewards. Along with the new system, two new arena maps were also introduced into the map pool.
