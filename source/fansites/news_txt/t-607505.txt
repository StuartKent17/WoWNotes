Multiboxing in WoW
A user on the european forums  asked Blizzard if it was allowed to play multiple accounts at the same time. Here is a short description from the original post 

Multiplexing, What is it?
Multiplexing is when someone uses either a program or a "splitter" to allow them to play 5 characters at the same time. For example, the user will press Thunderbolt rank X on the emitter First character chosen soon after the 4 other characters will cast the same spell.

What is "Boxing?"
Boxing is a sport Ofc But the term "Boxing refers to a Box, e.g cardboard box. And when 5 of the same class do the same thing, you could call this "Boxing"
We have stated several times that we have nothing against multiboxing. As long as the player controls each of the characters the player may run multiple clients/characters.
This is also a good opportunity to post the following tutorial explaining how to record multiple instances of WoW on the same computer.
