Essences Feedback - Multiple Role Essences<br>
These issues with Memory of Lucid Dreams&#x2019; minor effect should be resolved in the next PTR build for Protection Paladin. Thanks for the bug report! (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105773-essences-feedback-multiple-role-essences/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/181167/27))<br>
<br>
The next PTR build will have a change for both Brewmaster Monks and Guardian Druids with the Major power on Vision of Perfection.<br>
Brewmaster Monks have had the Major effect changed to activate Invoke Niuzao, the Black Ox, when it procs. It will summon it for 25/35% (rank1/rank2) of the talent&#x2019;s duration.<br>
<br>
Guardian Druids have had the Major effect changed to activate Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc for 25/35% of the talent&#x2019;s duration when it procs.<br>
The Minor/passive effect is unchanged for both specs, it will still provide cooldown reduction to Fortifying Brew or Survival Instincts.<br>
This should help the Essence feel a bit more noticeable and meaningful when it activates. Try it out in the next PTR build.

WoW Classic &#x201C;Not A Bug&#x201D; List Additions<br>
I&#x2019;ve added this to the OP:<br>
<br>
You are unable to Polymorph enemy targets that are tapped by players with whom you are not grouped. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105647-wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/175887/13))<br>
At all levels of player characters and enemies, aggro radius is set to the intended distance. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105647-wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/175887/14))<br>
Long quest objectives don&#x2019;t have text wrapping.<br>
Fall damage is equivalent to expected and verified values.<br>
Broadcast text can be seen multiple times if multiple players interact with the same NPC.<br>
WANTED signs do not have &#x201C;!&#x201D;, and are also not highlighted.<br>
Player characters do not animate when looting/interacting with quest objects (e.g. collecting pumpkins).<br>
Gnomes and Taurens are the correct size. <br>
<br>
<br>
The last one has been carefully verified. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105647-wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/175887/18))</div></div>
