<br>
Breath of the Black Prince<br>
To go along with the new The Black Prince faction there are some quests that end with the reward of a legendary item, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wowdb.com/items/87212-breath-of-the-black-prince&quot; class=&quot;wow-item wow-item-q5 item5&quot;&gt;Breath of the Black Prince&lt;/a&gt;! This item is likely used to upgrade your gear in some way. Before helping Wrathion, you first share a drink with him (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31454-a-legend-in-the-making) while talking about the future of Azeroth. <br>
<br>
The first quest (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31468-trial-of-the-black-prince) in the series requires an honored reputation level, which is earned by killing the mogu and mantid in the Townlong Steppes and the Dread Wastes, as well as any raid creatures. <br>
<br>
You must also collect (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31473-the-strength-of-ones-foes) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wowdb.com/items/87209-sigil-of-wisdom&quot; class=&quot;wow-item wow-item-q5 item5&quot;&gt;Sigil of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; x 10 and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wowdb.com/items/87208-sigil-of-power&quot; class=&quot;wow-item wow-item-q5 item5&quot;&gt;Sigil of Power&lt;/a&gt; x 10 from Mogu&apos;shan Vaults, Heart of Fear, or Terrace of Endless Spring. While you are raiding, you need to defeat the Sha of Fear (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31481-fear-itself) in Terrace of Endless Spring to obtain a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wowdb.com/items/87210-chimera-of-fear&quot; class=&quot;wow-item wow-item-q5 item5&quot;&gt;Chimera of Fear&lt;/a&gt;.<br>
<br>
At some point after this he will reward you with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wowdb.com/items/87212-breath-of-the-black-prince&quot; class=&quot;wow-item wow-item-q5 item5&quot;&gt;Breath of the Black Prince&lt;/a&gt;, but the quests are not chained yet, so we can&apos;t be certain as to what the requirements are. <br>
<br>
According to the quest descriptions he seems heavily invested in the fate of Pandaria, even hinting towards (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31483-incoming) the oncoming Horde and Alliance war fleets that will turn the beach of Krasarang Wilds into a battlezone in Patch 5.1.<br>

Method (http://methodwow.com/) has taken on Inferno Skeleton King and defeated him!<br>
1 day after release, and they beat act 1, and act 2 as well already on inferno i think.<br>
They have only killed the Skeleton King at this point. Do note that up to the Skeleton king is only part of the first act and they still have lots of the game to go till they complete act 1.<br>
<br>
Another point to be made is that this is a group of fully co-ordinated, skilled, dedicated and hardcore gamers who have been playing regularly since the moment of release. It will take quite a while longer for the average player and even most seasoned gamers to reach this point. That being said, it&apos;s amazing to see the speed in which they have reached this stage of the game, but remember that the hardest is yet to come...<br>

Diablo 3 Beaten in 7 Hours<br>
I&apos;m one of those people who likes to explore all of the map, because you never know what might be lurking in that unexplored part, right? I&apos;m in no hurry to rush through because that&apos;s not my play style, but I know we&apos;re all different. Some people love the bragging rights that come with being super quick through a game. Meh, I prefer to take my time, soak up the atmosphere, listen to the story, and loot every single damn barrel I find.<br>
<br>
But yeah, as others here have said, completing normal mode is by no means finishing the game... It&apos;s just the start. (Blue Tracker (http://www.diablofans.com/blizz-tracker/topic/223531-diablo-3-beaten-in-just-7-hours/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/4210101118?page=2#22))<br>
<br>
Diablo 3 Beaten in 6 Hours<br>
That&apos;s the problem... people are used to playing Skyrim<br>
You can beat Skyrim in a few hours if your intent is to rush to the end of the game as fast as possible. You can beat the original Super Mario Bros in 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
If your intent is to simply race to the end of the game as quickly as possible I&apos;m sure you can complete Normal difficulty in very little time. If your intent is to take your time and enjoy it, stop worrying about what people rushing to the end of the game think.<br>
<br>
Luckily, unlike other games, regardless of how quickly you want to rush to the end, the near-limitless content provided through randomized events, dungeons, enemies and items (and their random drop chance) mean that you&apos;ll be able to play for years to come. Welcome to Diablo III, please enjoy.
