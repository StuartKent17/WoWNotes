Starcraft II: What's Next Panel Recap

Co-op leaderboards are being explored.
The team wants to support video streams right in the client.
War Chests

They want to get another war chest out by the end of the year.
This time around they want to include building skins.
You will be able to unlock war chest rewards by watching Starcraft II Esports on Twitch.

With the new building skins they try to make sure that the profile remains similar to the original race design.
New Co-Op Commander - Zeratul

The challenge was to differentiate Zeratul from Vorazun
Units have Xel'Naga enhancements
Immortals can become enforcers that tilt their cannons up to shoot air units
They also incorporated Prophecy influences.
Zeratul will be able to use his prophetic vision ability to find Xel'Naga artifact fragments on the map.

These act as additional side quests that will power Zeratul's abilities when completed.
Each artifact fragment found unlocks an additional ability.
Ultimate Xel'Naga Constructs become available when all fragments are found on the map.

Zeratul can customize and choose his own top bar abilities.
One ability allows you to call down Legendary Protoss Legions.
