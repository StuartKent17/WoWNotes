World of Warcraft: Azeroth by the Numbers
Blizzard released a nice infographic today that shares lots of fun WoW stats!


  

From the rise of Onyxia to the fight for Pandaria, more than 100 million of you across the globe have visited Azeroth since the first realms went live in 2004. We’ve gathered some epic statistics to show what you’ve been up to all this time.

Curious about the faction breakdown among the 500 million characters you’ve created? Wonder how many instances your fellow adventurers run every day, or which pet is the most popular? Take a look at World of Warcraft’s first official infographic below for some fun and surprising never-before-seen facts about the game.

We hope everyone enjoys this glimpse at the inner workings of Azeroth—feel free to find and share it on Facebook and Twitter. Thanks for being a part of World of Warcraft’s history, and here’s to new adventures with you in Warlords of Draenor!


Garrosh Heirlooms and Bonus Rolls
Following up on the Garrosh Heirloom bonus roll information yesterday  comes some more bonus roll clarifications:


Quivering Blob  can be won with a bonus roll, and doesn't take the place of an item you would have won. Source 
Nalak, Oondasta, Galleon, and Sha of Anger mounts can be Bonus Rolled. Raid mounts cannot. Source 
Reins of the Astral Cloud Serpent aren't and have never been Bonus Rollable. Source 
Kor'kron Shaman's Treasure  cannot be bonus rolled. Source 
You can bonus roll Siege pets in appropriate difficulties due to community feedback about Quivering Blob. The pet is a separate roll from items, so it doesn't have any impact on winning other loot. Source

Random Battleground Balance and Queue Times
We talk about stuff like this from time to time, but it's not quite so simple. For example, queue times are a big issue. Separating players out by item level certainly wouldn't help, and in fact, could make things far worse. Having more equally-matched opponents in your random BG would be nice, but having to wait an hour or longer... not so much.

That said, we're hoping to make a lot of improvements to Random BG's in Warlords. If we get the opportunity to do something like this, we can look into it.

Side note since I brought it up: we're also looking into queue times. We have a few ideas for changes we might make, but nothing for certain to share just yet. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

PvP Blue Posts
One of my personal goals since I started at Blizzard has been to help improve communication with the PvP community. And, though I know it's technically a different forum, I've been as active as possible on the Arena forums contributing what I can. Many of those concerns extend to BGs and RBGs as well, and if you have a concern here that's PvP-related but not necessarily specific to Battlegrounds, it might be a good idea to check the Arena forums too just in case.

That said, I completely hear you guys on wanting to see more interaction in the Battlegrounds forums. I do read them regularly already, but I'll make a stronger effort to interact here more often. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

PvE
I miss using CC in dungeons and raids. Will this come back in WoD?
Not using CC in dungeons currently is mostly a result of being way stronger than the content is designed for. Celestalon 
I have needed 0 CC in MoP dungeons ever. Day 1 they were faceroll. Not saying that's 100% bad but it is true.
You are more experienced/skilled than most. That was not the experience for the majority. Celestalon 

PvP
With cross-realm arena it feels like there is still one final barrier: faction. Any plans for cross-faction teaming for real ID?
No plans for that. holinka 

yeah probably. I blame the 15 min ques between games! why are Horde ques so terrible?
There are more horde queuing. The problem is exacerbated if you opt out of unpopular BGs. Looking into options. holinka 

Future
Trying Monk heals on my 90, all proving grounds does is say "you suck" No benefit to me over failing thru LFR
Proving Grounds currently just "tests", it doesn't "teach". That's something we hope to change in the future. Celestalon 

Misc
'scuse me could you shed some light on a little red dragon named Andrestrasz? Is he a tribute, a memorial, something else...?
I believe that commented earlier that he was a tribute, but wasn't sure. Celestalon 
I'd bet $20 it's a homage to someone's 5 yr old named Andre but would have to dig into data to find out for sure. Source
