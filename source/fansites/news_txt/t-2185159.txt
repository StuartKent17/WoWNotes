Mythic+ Feedback
Thanks for copying this over! Good feedback here that I can send on up. I think the point on differences in difficulties between affixes is particularly relevant. Seems a relevant conversation the dev team would be happy to listen to is everyone's thoughts on how you deal with the various affixes ignore them, smaller pulls, etc, and how those experiences have evolved so far in Legion.

I would also be interested in how you guys rank the affixes in order of difficulty to deal with this obviously changes as the rank increases, but lets look at say... 5 which is pretty average in the current environment on live.

I'm also very aware of the differences between dungeons on Mythic+, and Ion has previously touched on the preference for Maw of Souls. I'm not exactly sure what can be done at the moment about the gaps the community sees between them, but I'm willing to take any feedback you guys want to share.

My biggest gripe with Mythic+ are the timers. Timers are the reason I didn't like CMs, and it's the reason I really dislike Mythic+ despite loving the concept.
I've seen this point of discussion too, and it's come up numerous times in my own feedback and reporting. Just wanted to say I know this is a valid opinion that I'm definitely aware of. Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753407148?page=3#43

Vengeance Demon Hunter Feedback
Thank you for the suggestions and discussion.

In today’s 7.2 PTR update, we’re testing the following change:


Demonic Wards now reduces all damage taken by 20% was 10%, and increases Armor by 75% was 120%.

What this amounts to is a passive reduction of all incoming damage, combined with a lowered defenses against physical damage, leaving almost no change to incoming physical, but a substantial new mitigation against magic.

Your feedback has been very helpful, so again, thank you! Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753506032?page=1#12

Protection Warrior Feedback
As before, we thank you for the good feedback.

The Nighthold has put a spotlight on magic mitigation more than previous raids, and we’ve seen how that resulted in Protection Warriors who are typically a very well-rounded tank spec falling a bit behind other tanks as a result.

Today’s new 7.2 PTR build includes the following change:

Warrior

Gleaming Scales Artifact Trait increases Spell Reflection magical damage reduction by 20%.

Gleaming Scales is a new Artifact Trait that’s coming in 7.2, and the intention here is to provide Warriors with a way to keep up with incoming spells in encounters that are magic-heavy, such as Spell Augur Etraeus or Krosus in The Nighthold. 

We’re also testing a new change to the Protection Legendary belt Thundergod’s Vigor that triples the rate at which your Thunder Claps reduce the cooldown on Demoralizing Shout.

We continue to analyze and consider everything you’re telling us here and elsewhere!, so keep it coming. Thank you! Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753515694?page=10#187
