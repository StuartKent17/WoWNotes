Legion Invasion Event Test - June 2
On Thursday, June 2, starting at 4:00 p.m. PDT, we will activate a new realm in the Legion Beta. This Beta realm will be named “Level 100 Demon Invasions”, and it will be dedicated to testing the pre-expansion demon invasion event with as many testers as possible for approximately 24 hours. We expect to remove the realm after 24 hours.

We ask that all Beta testers please join us in focusing testing on the “Level 100 Demon Invasions” realm when it is available. While you may see demon invasions on other Beta realms, testing this content requires that your character remain at level 100, so we ask that you test on the “Level 100 Demon Invasions” realm only.

Please direct your pre-Legion event feedback to the Beta General Discussion forum, and please direct any feedback you have about other Legion subjects to the appropriate dedicated subforum.

Thank you very much! We’ll see you at the defense of Azeroth!

Skirmishes Available in Legion Beta
Thanks for your continued participation in the beta. We've been reading all of your feedback and appreciate your contribution.

We've decided to re-enable skirmish queues on beta so we can start getting some arena feedback on honor talents. Jump in there and let us know what you think.

Yeah we can't test anything until there's a moderate change in numbers especially with tanks and low end healing numbers.
The next build has a number of changes to reign in tanks in PvP, most notably Protection Paladins. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Overly-Chatty Bodyguards
I did notice on a world boss the other companions people brought did clutter up the screen with chatter. I'm guessing any time you have 20 people with bodyguards this is bound to happen.

Also, I love Kayn Sunfury and his "Never Surrender!" cry. Please don't change him. He's perfect as is and I don't find him too chatty given it's once every couple of mobs that he'll even shoot out of the sky.
We will only adjust the permanent bodyguards. We are happy with how the others are playing out.

We will also take a look at those taunts and see what we can do to make them less frustrating. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Any words on the future of garrison invasions ? Will the mounts still be available in Legion ?
There will be no changes to the availability of these mounts and pets in #Legion. WarcraftDevs 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Just curious, are the people on stage at Blizzcon for example actually programmers or just the idea guys?
Very few studios employ someone just as an idea guy. Even designers have to do work at the keyboard. OccupyGStreet 
I'd definitely like being an 'idea guy', what do you 'do at your keyboard', Greg?
Design docs, scripting, hooking up art, changing data tables. A lot of email of course. OccupyGStreet 
I'd ask about those things in greater detail but that would be a bit much outside of DMs, etc. What sort of scripting?
A lot of mechanics design on WoW and LoL and doubtless many games are scripted. OccupyGStreet 
If you want to boost damage or damage coefficients, you can do that in an editor. OccupyGStreet 
If you want to special case anything e.g. bonus damage, set bonuses, weird interactions you script in a language like lua. OccupyGStreet 
Design isn't telling engineers how things should be. OccupyGStreet 
It is trying to get shit to work and then going to engineers for help when you can't make it work. OccupyGStreet
