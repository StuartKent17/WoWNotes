Character Viewer Updated: Female Dwarf!
You can see the previously released models here  The character viewer update also added icons for the Blood Elf and Draenei models.


      

We’ve updated the model viewer on our website  with a look at one of the revised characters you’ll see in Azeroth and beyond with Warlords of Draenor  Meet the new and improved female Dwarf 

It was a challenge for our character artists to find a balance between the classic female dwarf model and the expressiveness of her fluid new animations, but we think the updated model says “descended from unyielding stone” as much as “griffon-riding, ale-swilling, loud-living hero.”

We’ll continue to unearth more of Draenor and the shiny visuals coming to World of Warcraft around the release of Warlords  Keep your magnifiers and spectacles ready!


New Orc Model Skin Colors
A few people were excited by the wording of the new Orc Female model post yesterday, so Bashiok made it clear that players won't have access to brown skins at this time.
oh wait, green and brown-skinned, long-tusked heroine.
This is in reference to the brown skinned Orcs of Draenor, who will be using the new updated models as well of course.

We know there are a lot of requests for additional features and options, but as stated in this article "we made the decision early on to stay focused on improving what already exists in-game, and making sure we really nail it.

That said, we’ve also read your great ideas and feedback about features that you’d like to see as character customization options. Your collective voice matters to us, and we’d love to bring some of the coolest ideas to life someday if we can." 


New Orc Female Model Feedback
Can we please get rid of the corn row buzz cut thing? I would think my orc would know how to keep parts of her head clean shaven she has been keeping it clean shaven for years.
They're actually shaved lines, not braids. In some of the shots you can see they're not exact and not symmetrical, and that's intentional. Chris tweeted some backstory, and the intent is to give a bit more of a savage-warrior type vibe.



I painted in some shaved lines, like she shaves that area of her head with her axe as a sign of her kills. as an example of where we're making small adj. to give characters more depth without hopefully deviating too much Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Looks good, only quibble is the tusks, seem too thin. In the kiss pose they look like little mustachios
We're actually animating those for more range of motion with the face, so they're scaled down in that pose, not all the time. Source
