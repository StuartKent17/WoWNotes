Kirin Tor Tavern Crawl Micro-Holidaykttc
The Kirin Tor Tavern Crawl http://ptr.wowdb.com/world-events/646-kirin-tor-tavern-crawl is a micro-holiday that sends players to different taverns around the world. 


You can join the currently active tavern from a new NPC in Dalaran Tipsi Wobblerune http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119045-tipsi-wobblerune or Anebria Sunwine http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119088-anebria-sunwine
After some time the group moves along to the next Tavern. You can press the last call button or take the portal to move on.
If you get left behind on the tavern tour, you can catch up by speaking to the mage in the current tavern you are in. 
Each location has drink and food that you can interact with. The food will grant a well fed buff.
There are also additional NPCs in each tavern enjoying the holiday.
You can click on the discarded packages to apply one of many unique hat models for four hours.
