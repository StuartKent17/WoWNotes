Blizzard Holiday Activity 2017-2018
Hey all!

Another year has flown by, and now the heroes of Azeroth are rushing from their footholds on Argus into Antorus to bring an end to the Burning Legion.

But back on Azeroth, the seasons are changing and Winter Veil is nearly here. Those old Azerothian traditions of good cheer and high spirits are starting to captivate us as we move into a colder time of year; a season where we gather together around the hearth with those who we hold closest to us - our family, friends, and colleagues.

In the same spirit, winter is nearly upon us here at Blizzard, and with it we wanted to share some notes on what you can expect from us over the next month and into the new year, especially during the holidays.


There will be less Blizzard employee activity across most World of Warcraft forums, especially normal Community Manager activity in General Discussion. There will be reduced activity on World of Warcraft's social media platforms. Customer Support staff will still be hard at work during the holidays - if you need to contact Customer Support for any reason, you will be able to do so through the Blizzard Support site. Please take note that there will still be Support staff monitoring the forums and assisting with moderation, and our Customer Support forums will remain active through the holiday season!

I'd like to remind you, and I think it's an important note, that discussions will still be monitored throughout the holidays, so please continue to share your feedback and take part in discussions while we're away!

As always, we’d like to thank everyone for their understanding as many of us step away from our keyboards and take time to travel and visit with our loved ones. We look forward to returning after the holidays in 2018, for what looks to be an epic year for World of Warcraft.

From all of us here at Blizzard Entertainment: Happy holidays, happy New Year, and we will see you in 2018!

PvP Events
Dust off your battle gear and ready yourself to scramble in Warsong Gulch and have gravity or the lack thereof send your feet flying in this month’s Brawls.

PvP Brawl: Warsong Scramble - December 26–January 2
Warsong Gulch has always been the scene of an epic capture-the-flag battle, but what happens when you can capture your enemy’s flag without having your own at your base?

This Week in WoW History
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during Nov 26 - Dec 2 in previous years.

Product Slate Leak
In late 2010 a Product Slate was leaked from Blizzard containing planned projects up to 2015. At the time of the leak, this document was already about 8 months old, which allowed us to connect some of their products that came out during the year the document. Estimated release dates for the next two WoW expansions X4 and X5, along with the new MMOFPS game Titan were among the most important dates. Looking back now, Titan was scrapped and replaced with the Overwatch project, and the WoW movie date was much later, but this gave everyone an idea of what the company was working on at the time.


 

Patch 4.3: Hour of Twilight
The last content patch of Cataclysm brought a lot of new content into the game. The new raid introduced was Dragon Soul, where heroes fought to defeat Deathwing, the cause of the Cataclysm. The introduction of this new raid also brought us Raid Finder, which became the lowest difficulty and allowing players to queue for it through an automated system. The new raid was also accompanied by three new dungeons, Well of Eternity, Hour of Twilight, and End Time. This content patch also added the Legendary Daggers, new mounts, Void Storage, new companion pets, and Transmogrification.


 

Darkmoon Faire Updated
Patch 5.1 made a few changes to the Darkmoon Faire. The Darkmoon Carousel replaced an Under Construction tent, and riding it gave players a buff which increased Experience and Reputation gains by 10%. Daily pet battle quests were also added here, with a chance at rewarding players with two new battle pets. Darkmoon Prize Tickets can now also be used to purchase the Swift Forest Strider and three companions.


 

Ghostcrawler Leaves Blizzard
Greg Street, known in the gaming community as Ghostcrawler announced that he will be leaving Blizzard to pursue another opportunity. His tweets famously became the beloved "Ghostcrawler Tweets" on MMO-Champion, and continued long after he left the company. He is currently employed by Riot Games.


 

Highmaul and Tier 17
The first raid of Warlords of Draenor was only 7 bosses long, which is about typical of beginning of expansion raids. This short raid ended with the defeat of Imperator Mar'gok which featured an interesting mythic only phase that was unknown until the top guilds defeated him. During this week the Tier sets for Blackrock Foundry were also featured, showing off a few iconic sets which were very well designed for the second raid of the expansion.


 

Artifact Weapon Preview
During the Beta stages of Legion, a series of posts previewed the artifact weapons which would be unlocked by each of the classes in the new expansion. Artifact Weapons were the biggest change introduced in Legion, bringing with them the Artifact power system. 


 

Secondary Stats and Artifact Knowledge in Legion
This rework made secondary stats less impactful, to ensure that an item level upgrade meant an output increase in general. This patch also brought a much needed catch-up mechanic for players with alts. Artifact Research Compendium could be purchased and sent to alts to increase their Artifact Knowledge level.


 

Make-A-Wish
The yearly charity companion in 2015 was Brightpaw the Mana Kitty, and during the 2016 holiday season Mischief was added to the collection. These pets are purchasable in the Battle.net Shop, and the adoption fee goes to the Make-A-Wish foundation, who are focused on granting wishes to children in life threatening medical conditions. If you want to embrace your charitable nature while also getting a cool in-game pet, this is the way to go.
