Mistweaver and Essence Font<br>
With the changes to Mistweaver during the transition to Legion, there was already a degree of homogenization from what was previously a fairly unique gameplay experience to something more similar to what already existed in other healing classes. As you consider further changes to Mistweaver, is further samey-ness something that&apos;s &quot;on the radar&quot;?<br>
It is, although possibly in the opposite way. If anything, thinking that Essence Font had to be forced into an off-cooldown design from the start &quot;just to be different&quot; probably didn&apos;t help anybody. The spec flowing better for everyone using it matters more than symmetries or antisymmetries between specs and how they look on paper. Nobody actually playing either spec is going to forget whether they&apos;re on a Mistweaver or a Resto Druid just because Essence Font follows a successful design like Wild Growth. The spells around them, the different interactions they have, and the whole pile of talents, traits, and item bonuses all doing different things ensures that.<br>
<br>
There&apos;s always a balance between lessons and good designs that are generally true throughout the game, and variance between specs. And powerful AoE heals usually having some cooldown (for a number of reasons) is a factor that&apos;s more likely to improve Mistweaver gameplay than worrying about being a carbon copy of other specs (which it&apos;s pretty far from, all things considered).

Brewmaster - Stagger in Patch 7.2.5<br>
What exactly do you mean by a cap on how much damage can be staggered? Is there a maximum amount of damage that is allowed to be in the stagger dot? Or does each attack have a maximum amount that can be absorbed from it and added to the stagger dot? This is hugely important to know.<br>
There will be a maximum amount of total damage that you can have banked in your Stagger DoT. Any overflow beyond that will continue through to your health.<br>
<br>
I personally love the way Blackout Strike fits into the rotation, especially with Blackout Combo. <br>
And you&apos;re not alone; we recognize that there are many Brewmasters who love Blackout Combo, and have Haste in the right thresholds to make it flow reasonably well. One of the things of utmost importance to us with this rotation change is that it doesn&apos;t feel worse to those like you. We have several experienced Brewmasters internally who voiced this apprehension when first hearing about these changes, and after playtesting it they all agreed that it felt the same to them. In our books, that&apos;s a win, since it&apos;s an improvement for the rest of the Brewmasters who aren&apos;t in that sweet spot. We hope that sentiment is common externally as well, so please test it out when the PTR goes up, and let us know how it feels. Your feedback on this really matters.<br>
<br>
The ability to be GCD capped, or very close to it, is something that I have always loved about brewmasters and on a personal level of feedback it is really important to me that that type of gameplay is still available and viable. Brewmaster has always been a very high APM spec (even if not all of the GCDs directly translate to defensive benefits) so please be careful to maintain that as you tinker with the rotation.<br>
We absolutely hear you, and are targeting Spitfire, Rushing Jade Wind, and Haste at players like you. It&apos;ll probably take us some iteration on the energy and proc rate numbers to get the feel just right, so we&apos;ll need your help with PTR testing feedback.<br>
<br>
Please Increase the IsB duration cap, at least 30-40s. 16s is too short.<br>
And when will you address that bears have been OP for too long and EASIER to play without any significant nerf?<br>
We&apos;re starting with a cap of &quot;double the base duration,&quot; but that may feel too restrictive, and we&apos;ll iterate. This is still early in the process (PTR hasn&apos;t even started yet), and none of this is set in stone.<br>
<br>
Cheers to everyone that has provided valuable feedback here so far. We&apos;ll keep reading and iterating.<br>
<br>
&quot;First, Blackout Strike and Breath of Fire will have a direct defensive value: they&apos;ll grant a stack of Elusive Brawler (per target hit, in Breath of Fire&apos;s case).&quot; -- I am sure you are well aware this will push Mastery&apos;s value through the roof.<br>
That&apos;s certainly possible, and we&apos;ll adjust stat tuning if needed. Again, this is intended to be performance-neutral, so we&apos;re not trying to buff OR nerf overall performance here.<br>
<br>
On the AM max duration discussion, there&apos;s been a ton of great feedback on that so far. I&apos;d like to go into why we&apos;re considering this change a little more. Forgive me for the verbosity (hah):<br>
<br>
This effects Brewmasters more than other tanks, but not exclusively. The main reason that this affects Brewmasters more is that they are meant to split their resource between two brews: Ironskin and Purifying.<br>
<br>
Consider a simple situation of two bosses, each beating on a tank. The Brewmaster is using a mixture of their Brews, maintaining ISB while using excess on PB (or maybe even letting ISB fall off when the boss stops to cast something, or is otherwise unthreatening for a moment). She gets more Brew charges than she needs to keep ISB up, but she&apos;s using those excess charges on PB, so ISB duration is remaining low.<br>
<br>
The co-tank, let&apos;s say a Warrior for example, is built a little differently, having two separate defensive resources (Shield Block charges and Rage for Ignore Pain). Both are being generated and consumed at a similar rate, also not gaining increasing Shield Block duration.<br>
<br>
Things are good here, and let&apos;s suppose for the sake of argument the two tanks are &apos;balanced&apos; in this context.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
OK, now let&apos;s change the design of the fight, to one where there&apos;s one huge boss, and the two tanks take turns tanking for 30sec at a time. Arguments of this being a less-engaging fight aside, let&apos;s look at how that affects the tank balance.<br>
<br>
While the Warrior is OTing, he&apos;s building up Shield Block charges, but once he hits max charges, they&apos;re being wasted. He can use one at a time as they&apos;re generated, but they don&apos;t last longer than it takes to generate, so his Shield Block buff duration doesn&apos;t grow over time. Similar deal with Rage and Ignore Pain. He builds up Rage, and when that caps out, he builds up an Ignore Pain stack, but that caps out pretty quickly too. Excess Rage is wasted (at least defensively anyway; they can put it into damage). When the Warrior taunts, he goes into it with some buffer of his max Shield Block charges, maybe a single partial Shield Block buff, and max Rage and Ignore Pain. Overall, he could carry over some value from that time not tanking, but not all of it.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, when the Brewmaster is not tanking, they&apos;re building up charges of their single defensive resource, Brew charges. Once at max Brew charges, she starts using Ironskin Brews, as they&apos;re generated. Since there&apos;s nothing to Purify, she never does so, and all of her charges go into Ironskin Brew, creating a surplus of Ironskin duration that just grows over time. When she taunts, she goes into it with max Brew charges, and a 1min long Ironskin buff. She never has to Ironskin the whole time she&apos;s tanking, and can send all of her Brew charges into Purifying, over tripling (if not more) how often she can Purify, providing a sizable gain over her Warrior counterpart. All that time she spent not tanking goes into storing up defensive value for when she is tanking, with no limit.<br>
<br>
If the two tanks were &apos;balanced&apos; in the first fight, then the Brewmaster is overpowered in the second. Alternatively, if you argue that they&apos;re balanced in the second fight, that means they&apos;re underpowered in the first. The goal of this change is to place a reasonable limit on how much value you can carry over from time spent not tanking, so that we can tune the tanks to be balanced in both of these situations, not just one of them.<br>
<br>
I totally get that right now you can always get benefit out of hitting Ironskin Brew, never being fully wasted, and so the prospect of going to a system where there may be a time where you&apos;re just sitting on full charges, wasting them sounds like a negative. Please understand that for most other tanks, that&apos;s just normal; a Warrior that&apos;s not tanking is just wasting the defensive value of their Shield Block charges once at max charges, and that&apos;s just an accepted norm. By bringing Brewmasters into parity in this regard, we can then tune them to be more consistently balanced with other tanks, which is the core goal of the change.<br>
<br>
One of the most common responses so far has been &quot;I understand wanting a cap, but 2x*duration is too short&quot;. Totally reasonable argument, and we&apos;ll need your help finding what the right cap is. We chose that to start with because that&apos;s consistent with things like Ignore Pain, Mark of Ursol, Blood Shield, Soul Fragments, etc. Given the more liberal use of Brew charges, it may be more appropriate to be higher for Brewmasters.<br>
<br>
I&apos;d love to keep hearing your thoughts on this, and I hope that this massively-over-verbose post helped better explain our thought process here. Thanks to those of you that stuck with it, reading it all the way through. <br>
<br>
This is probably the most extreme example I can pull from in game currently and it results in 21.5 million staggered, which is certainly a lot but I know on Mythic Gul&apos;dan, there have been moments where I&apos;ve had between 10 million and 18 million staggered and subsequently purified. How will this design idea allow those two different situations to co-exist? How does the game react to me being sent to stagger cap because of a single huge ability that should&apos;ve killed me rather than the fact that the boss encounter just hits extremely hard? And if your retort is &quot;well, brewmasters shouldn&apos;t be able to solo fel scythes and still continue to tank the boss&quot; my counter is &quot;what about guardians doing the same thing with roughly the same amount of externals?&quot;<br>
That is exactly my retort, and Guardians shouldn&apos;t be able to either. Soloing every 100-Energy Fel Scythe is perfect example of the cheese this is intended to prevent, and we&apos;ll be preventing it on Guardians as well.<br>
<br>
How much of a threshold are we talking? One stagger bar? Two? Five? Ten? <br>
<br>
When we reach this threshold, what happens? Do we begin to take unmitigated hits? Will stagger simply stop working? If so, what&apos;s the plan for taking an unmitigated raid boss hit, as a few bosses are capable of 100-0% a 910 brewmaster in a single swing?<br>
<br>
The current idea is that the Stagger bar that the UI shows is the cap, which matches up with your health bar, since that&apos;ll be the most understandable and intuitive. Then, however much of a buff to max health is needed to make that balanced.<br>
<br>
Example, with 80% Stagger, 33% Armor for convenient numbers:<br>
<br>
HP: 100/100 ~ Stagger: 0/100<br>
<br>
Take a hit for 30, armor reduces that to 20, then stagger takes 16, and 4 goes through to HP.<br>
HP: 96/100 ~ Stagger: 16/100<br>
<br>
Time passes and 8 of the Stagger damage goes over into HP.<br>
HP: 88/100 ~ Stagger: 8/100<br>
<br>
Then you take a big hit for 60, armor reduces that to 40, then stagger takes 32, and 8 goes through to HP.<br>
HP: 80/100 ~ Stagger: 40/100<br>
<br>
You quickly Purify 50% of that.<br>
HP: 80/100 ~ Stagger: 20/100<br>
<br>
Then you take a *massive* hit for 210 (something cheesy), armor reduces that to 140. Stagger would take 112, but there&apos;s only room for 80 in your Stagger bar. So Stagger takes 80, and 60 goes through to HP.<br>
HP: 20/100 ~ Stagger: 100/100<br>
<br>
TL;DR: The Stagger bar on your UI is now representative of your maximum stagger pool, and any overflow damage continues on into your HP bar. Max HP is increased as needed, such that these two bars combined are a big enough pool for normal gameplay.

Outlaw discussion: RTB and True Bearing<br>
Two things I think many of us can agree on right now: <br>
<br>
<br>
1. True Bearing&apos;s cooldown reduction per combo point spent mechanic is fun to play with. The mechanic has been on the spec for a long time as a passive with a different name (Restless Blades), and largely drove the pacing and feel of the spec. 2. True Bearing is much stronger than any of the other single Roll the Bones buffs, on average.<br>
<br>
That said, we&apos;re going to make two changes to Outlaw Rogues in 7.2.5:<br>
<br>
1. The True Bearing mechanic is being added to Outlaw as a baseline passive (called Restless Blades), tuned to an appropriate pacing and power level for how many combo points the spec currently generates. Restless Blades, currently in 7.2.5 is tuned at 0.5 sec of cooldown reduction per combo point because realistically, the spec now generates easily 2-3x more combo points compared to a couple expansions ago, and the pacing impact and tuning of Restless Blades should reflect that. 2. True Bearing will remain as one of the 6 Roll the Bones buffs, but will be tuned down from 2.0 to 1.0 sec of cooldown reduction per combo point. We&apos;re serious about balancing each of the 6 individual buffs against each other, and True Bearing at 2.0 sec is clearly out of line.<br>
<br>
We&apos;ll be keeping a close eye on Roll the Bones during 7.2.5 development, and as usual will make further tuning/adjustments as necessary.
