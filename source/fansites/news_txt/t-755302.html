The new interface for Glyphs is finally available and it comes with a couple of very interesting improvements. <br>
<br>
<br>
The biggest change, Glyphs are no longer a consumable item. You learn them and can swap them at any time after that, without having to buy them again.<br>
Prime Glyphs slots have been added<br>
All Glyphs are now listed, including the one you didn&apos;t learn yet. <br>
You can search for Glyphs, and filter them.<br>
<br>
