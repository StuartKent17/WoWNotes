Dragoncon 2015<br>
TheCrafticus (https://twitter.com/TheCrafticus/with_replies) was at Dragoncon and talked about Legion! MMO-Central (http://www.mmo-central.com/) and Elvine (https://twitter.com/Elvinelol/with_replies) were also there and live tweeted (https://twitter.com/mmoc_events/with_replies) the whole thing.<br>
<br>
Classes<br>
<br>
Demon Hunters are starting at Level 98 right now.<br>
Death Knights will continue to start at Level 55.<br>
Demon Hunters will have a short transform, with inner demon visuals.<br>
Only Demon Hunters will be able to use glaives. <br>
Double jump won&apos;t be disabled anywhere.<br>
Survival Hunters will get a Harpoon ability that allows them to throw a spear to pull mobs towards them.<br>
Most specs are getting overhauled, tweaking them to fit the fantasy of the spec. Some will be renamed.<br>
Some specs will use a renamed resource, such as Insanity for Shadow Priest.<br>
The sewer class hall for Rogues looks great, not really like a sewer at all. It will have treasure chests. <br>
The Moonkin model will be updated.<br>
No new major glyphs will be added.<br>
No Gnome hunters yet, maybe when it makes sense to add them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Professions<br>
<br>
There will be a &quot;single system&quot; to upgrade profession items. The current item will be destroyed, giving you a reagent needed for the upgrade (Obliterium). <br>
A new team will be working on professions this time, including profession quest lines.<br>
Professions will get some crafting items from dungeon loot.<br>
Professions won&apos;t have daily cooldowns.<br>
Prospecting could make a return.<br>
<br>
<br>
Transmog / Items / Stats<br>
<br>
If the new transmog system is account wide, the item must be usable by the class trying to use it.<br>
No tabard tab is currently planned, but the new transmog system should help to clear up some space.<br>
Multistrike is being removed and other secondary stats will have changes as well.<br>
Players can still only equip three profession crafted items.<br>
There won&apos;t be specific item art for each race and class, as Artifact weapon art is the priority. <br>
<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
<br>
Dungeons will absolutely be relevant again.<br>
Illidan is ready to lead Demon Hunters against the Burning Legion.<br>
The Park in Stormwind won&apos;t be repaired yet.<br>
There are plans for Jaina. <br>
The backpack might be updated.<br>
Warlords was not a filler expansion and built some things that will be used going forward.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Patch 6.2.2 Hotfixes - September 4<br>
Raids and Dungeons<br>
Timewalking<br>
<br>
Gundrak<br>
<br>
Fixed an issue where the loot tables for Gal&apos;darah and Eck the Ferocious got swapped while Timewalking.<br>
<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
General<br>
<br>
Fixed an issue where players were not transforming correctly into the opposite faction in Mercenary Mode.<br>
Players with the Mercenary Contract effect should now be able to use faction mounts while in an Arena Skirmish, Rated Arena match, or Rated Battleground.<br>
Fixed an issue where Rated Battleground faction auras were incorrectly applied while in the Arena.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bug Fixes<br>
<br>
Fixed an issue where some characters were unable to complete bonus objectives.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Legion - Moonkin Model Update<br>
Sounds like there&#x2019;s been a misunderstanding somewhere here. Our current plan is that Moonkin Form will indeed receive a high-res model update in Legion.<br>
