We won't see the argent dawn in Northrend ... Weird, there are tons of undead here. Who the hell could help killing them ?

Tirion Fordring will reorder and lead the Silver Hand in Northrend ... with the help of [item=13262] ! Which means that the sword could perfectly not be available to players. Actually, according to screenshots from the Blizzcon found on the web, he's wielding it in Valgarde !!

This would also confirm the huge hint "We are considering going back to Naxx when we get to Northrend" during the Raid & Dungeon panel.
