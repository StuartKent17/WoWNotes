Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftain Contest Winners
The recording studio may be closed, and the janitors hard at work cleaning up what's left of the pizza, but that doesn't mean the party has to stop now. We've watched video after video and found just the right mix of rock and pomp to fit Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftain's new smash hit "Rogues Do it From Behind."

Three Grand Prize winners have been chosen to each receive an Ipod Touch 8GB version, and five First Place winners will each receive a Logitech G15 keyboard and a World of Warcraft Battle Chest signed by the members of L70ETC.

Check out the contest winners page http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/contests/l70etc-musicvideo/winners.html now!
