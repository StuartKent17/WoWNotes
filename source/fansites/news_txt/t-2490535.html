The cancellation was made in order to focus on Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2.<br>
The canceled project was code-named Ares.<br>
It was described as being similar to the Battlefield franchise, but in the StarCraft Universe.<br>
According to sources, it was a massive shock that Blizzard canceled it as it was &quot;looking quite good.&quot;<br>
Nobody has been laid off as a result of the cancellation, but moved to the upcoming Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2.<br>
Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2 are expected to be announced at Blizzcon in the fall.<br>
Overwatch 2 is rumored to have a large PvE element, and has been compared to Left 4 Dead.<br>
Ares started as an experiment to do something with StarCraft on the Overwatch engine.<br>
Blizzard has wanted to move as many games as possible to the same technology as the Overwatch engine to be more efficient.<br>
Dustin Browder, who led Heroes of the Storm and StarCraft II, was supposed to be the director of the project.</div></div>
