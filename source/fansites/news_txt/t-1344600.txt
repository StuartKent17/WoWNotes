Siege of Orgrimmar Heroic Progression
Blood Legion  is leading progress tonight, with 9/14 bosses down. Midwinter  and Duality  are close behind, closing a gap from earlier in the night at 8/14 bosses. Over in the 10 player column, Avast  is currently leading with 5/14 bosses down.

Keep in mind that EU progression has not started yet, as realms are currently still down for the Wednesday maintenance. 


  


Conquest Vendors Temporarily Disabled
We are aware of an issue affecting a number of players that caused them to have an unusually high Conquest Point cap. Conquest vendors have been temporarily disabled while we work on a fix to correct this. Conquest Points obtained in excess of the 2200 point cap will be lost and we'll be removing the Grievous Conquest achievement from any characters that managed to obtain it.

The vendors will be made available again once the fix is in place.
