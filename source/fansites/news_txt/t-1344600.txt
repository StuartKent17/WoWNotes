Conquest Vendors Temporarily Disabled
We are aware of an issue affecting a number of players that caused them to have an unusually high Conquest Point cap. Conquest vendors have been temporarily disabled while we work on a fix to correct this. Conquest Points obtained in excess of the 2200 point cap will be lost and we'll be removing the Grievous Conquest achievement from any characters that managed to obtain it.

The vendors will be made available again once the fix is in place.


Patch 5.4 Hotfixes: September 17

Feldrake as a Ground Mount
The Feldrake http://www.wowdb.com/items/79771-feldrake having ground mount functionality was originally a bug. When the bug got fixed for all drakes, that functionality got removed. A hotfix is being worked on to add ground mount functionality back in for the Feldrake.
