PvP Tuning Incoming - February 26<br>
Today, we&#x2019;re working on hotfixes that will focus on two areas of concern.<br>
<br>
As we&#x2019;ve monitored PvP matches since our PvP mana changes to healers and Restoration Druids, we&#x2019;ve found that Lifebloom, as a source of healing, has become too-efficient. While the reduction to Focused Growth&#x2019;s increased healing and mana cost savings is a sizeable change, Restoration Druids have a wide variety of well-performing PvP talent options to fit in its place.<br>

<br>
Restoration<br>
Focused Growth (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/203554-focused-growth) now reduces the mana cost of Lifebloom by 8% (was 20%).<br>
Focused Growth (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/203554-focused-growth) now increases the healing of Lifebloom by 8% per stack (was 20%).<br>
<br>
<br>
Additionally, we&#x2019;ve identified an Azerite Trait that has been providing too much healing in an arena environment when multiple members of a team equip the trait.<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Heart of Azeroth<br>
Bonded Souls (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/288802-bonded-souls) healing reduced by 85% when engaged in combat with enemy players (was 50%).<br>
<br>
<br>
These changes are not live yet, but will be made live soon. I&#x2019;ll update this post when the changes go live, and as always, you&#x2019;ll see them noted in their final form in our next Hotfixes Update.</div></div>
