08/08/2009
Prayer of Mending will now trigger Divine Aegis on the healed target and not the priest who cast Prayer of Mending.
Players on vehicles, when the Isle of Conquest battleground ends, will now properly receive the appropriate number of Isle of Conquest Marks of Honor.
General Vezax will now cast Shadow Crash slightly less frequently. He will also refrain from casting Searing Flames multiple times in succession.
Hand of Reckoning is no longer able to be used on targets that are immune to taunt, including players.
