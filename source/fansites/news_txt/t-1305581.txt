Character / Items
Greg, what will happen to ch.mode gear when the new exp. hits? Would be a shame if all these cool sets became unobtainable.
They don't strictly need to be unobtainable. If the dungeons keep scaling you down, the challenge will still be there. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338367292272427010
Though to be honest, we're not sure yet what our actual solution will be. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338367407649353729

Will items be something like Bloodsoaked instead of Thunderforged in 5.4?
Yes. Assuming we do it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338027120771076096

On a side note, will we ever see Progression-Paths outside of Gear for Characters at Max-Level?
We would like to, but we have to come up with good systems. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337004333071740928

could you elaborate on the valor vendor going away in 5.4. That could be punishing to those still a tier behind or more
But we do like having a place you can earn gear even if you don't want to raid. I just didn't want to announce that content yet. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336599620979421184
I don't think GC meant that the older valor vendors are going away. Just that you won't have new ones. Right?
The older ones won't go away and we don't know if there will be new ones or not. It's just an idea at this stage. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336998576615997440

PvP
What's the objection with returning AV back to where it was a few years ago where epic battles could have lasted hours?
The problem is some players don't want a very long BG. We've discussed making long BGs their own thing.... Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335805077153529856

Disabling auto follow in Battle Grounds has only hurt the multi boxer.
The problem is when multi boxers are having fun in PvP, everyone else often is not. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322396622594125824
The biggest issue is that this change has utterly destroyed a play style that has been accepted for 8 year's!!
Nevertheless, do you think it was fun for the solo players on the receiving end? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/333297259028557824

Why isn't PvP gear upgradable? This is driving me away from pvp...I can't just jump into a raid in pvp gear and be hit capped
It takes a lot of Conquest gear just to purchase your gear. We didn't want you to also have to upgrade it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337302249317478401

Patch 5.3 PvP Changes
Blue post says new players get discouraged cuz of gear difference in pvp. But getting one shot in FULL boa by prot warr is OK
Low level Shield Slam was fixed in 5.3. To be fair, while low level still matters, far more players care about 90 PvP balance. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335802257029357569

PVP power gems are useless in PVP atm compared to a STR gem please explain why or is it blizzards hate towards PVP showing
Strength is still a PvP stat. Why does that offend you? I can understand why PvE gear would. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335793665282809857

What's the point of the nerf to PvP stats?
Getting e.g. a Conq weapon made a huge swing in damage. We want gear progression but not huge swings. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335793334289313795

thx to ur stupid decision cancelling pvp resilience. i am afk . byebye wow.
You understand, I hope, that we're trying to improve the experience when players in vastly different gear try to PvP. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/333300634608611329
Why even have gear in pvp? Seems counterintuitive, pvp is about action, not long-term planning gear.
Getting rewards is fun. Without power based progression goals we don't think many players would stick with it for long. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335228553694167040
Some might, just as some raiders raid just to see the fights, not to earn gear. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335228663467483137

in 5.3 pve ganked tanks are FAR better than pvp geared tanks for RBG.. they dont need pvp power, defensive stats better. why?
We don't want anyone, not even tanks, to be super hard to kill as FCs. It's not fun for anyone. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335230597519781889

why do you always treat PVP players as 2nd class in wow, bg's are broken,bots run rampant,and pvp nerfs in 5.3, please fix pvp
Look at the list of 5.3 changes. Ask yourself how many were PvE vs PvP fixes. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335225270996979712

http://t.co/KveNIAuLKx Read that please and write back your thoughts on it please
Feel like we have addressed this a bunch. PvPers told us they wanted PvP to be more about skill and less about gear. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338372434711433216
PvE'ers told us they would participate more in PvP if they didn't die immediately until they had better gear. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338372546372182017
Letting someone use PvE gear as *starter* gear in PvP and vice versa allows more crossover and gives you more opponents. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338372701800517632

Funny how you guys didn't care about ppl getting smashed in PvP until just recently. Why is that?
Mostly, player feedback. We were worried it was driving folks out of PvP. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338371252089655296

what is the point of pvp gear now? Lack of blizz responses is discouraging. Pvp gear =no point. The community wants a response
The community or at least part of it asked vociferously for PvP gear to matter less in PvP to allow for catch-up. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337263546633158656
yeah pvp gear is a joke. No point in even buying it. Just afk in LFR and u can beat someone in full pvp
By "full pvp" do you mean Honor or Conquest? Conquest, no way. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337990190029225984
Sure, but what about honor gear? 20 item level deficit vs. LFR gear is a lot for PvP power to overcome post-nerf.
If you'd rather LFR to get gear instead of Honor gear, that seems fine. You'll want to graduate to Conquest either way. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338042808868933633
Honor gear is pretty much catch up gear. If you PvP seriously, you'll earn some Conquest. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338042656074645504
Intuitively, Random Battlegrounds giving worse PvP rewards than doing LFR doesn't seem "fine" to me, but I see your pt
You can run BGs as much as you want but raids once a week or so. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338119011428610049
But at the same time, when a new season comes serious PVP'ers "must" LFR to stay ahead aka not get behind
You can earn all your Honor gear in a week or two depending on how much you play. LFR is nowhere near that generous. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338367011052728320

My level 85 alts only have 40% baseline resilience still, not 65%. Intended?
Yes, the 65% was for level 90. Lower characters will have less. Partially that's because there is still resilience gear at 85. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337005595687284736


Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/june/ssdgraph.gif are stable, with almost all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. No new GPUs worth waiting for are expected before the third quarter this year. RAM prices have been increasing for the past few months, so if you were thinking about adding RAM anytime soon, now is the time.

The new Haswell CPUs from Intel are here http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1 and they offer a ~10% performance increase over the previous generation of CPUs in most applications. They run a little bit on the warmer side, so depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&tag=mmochamp-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A or H90 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4OCWDE?ie=UTF8&tag=mmochamp-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00B4OCWDE. 

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx and Nvidia http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us drivers up to date.
