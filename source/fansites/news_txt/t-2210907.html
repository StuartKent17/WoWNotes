Beast Mastery Hunter Changes in 7.2.5<br>
Hi Beast Masters. We&#x2019;ve been reading your feedback and trying different sets of changes for Beast Mastery Hunters internally and on PTR.<br>
<br>
To start, we are reverting all 7.2.5 changes we&#x2019;ve made so far to how Wild Call triggers. Instead, Dire Beast and Dire Frenzy will have 2 charges baseline. The Mantle of Command (legendary shoulders that currently add +1 charge to Dire Beast/Dire Frenzy) will be changed to instead further increase the proc chance of Wild Call. <br>
<br>
Overall, this will result in more Focus for all Beast Mastery Hunters, resulting in a more active rotation. Additionally, this gives all Beast Mastery Hunters access to a Dire Beast/Dire Frenzy with 2 charges playstyle that is more engaging and fun, allowing you to make decisions on when to use the buttons, instead of feeling like you should most often simply push them on cooldown.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ve been trying other iterations of changes surrounding Dire Beast/Dire Frenzy and Wild Call, including increasing Dire Beast/Dire Frenzy Focus generation or versions that avoided changing the legendary shoulders drastically, but ultimately reached the conclusion that giving 2 charges to the abilities baseline, which many of you have asked for, was the best change for the spec at the current time. We appreciate your patience while we try different iterations on PTR.<br>
<br>
We are also making a few other less major changes to the spec in the next PTR patch, including:<br>
<br>
Aspect of the Wild will reduce the global cooldowns of your damaging abilities by 0.2 seconds, allowing you to more reliably spend the Focus you&#x2019;re generating while it&apos;s active, especially with Dire Beast/Dire Frenzy going off. Kill Command and Dire Frenzy will cause your pet/Hati to charge up to 40 yds (up from 25 yds) to the target, matching the max range of your ranged abilities. When your pet casts Dash, Hati will also gain Dash for the same duration.<br>

FEEDBACK: Tomb Raid Finder Wing 1<br>
Tomb of Sargeras is now open for testing Raid Finder difficulty. Specifically, the first wing (The Gates of Hell) is now available on the PTR. We expect to keep the wing open for the entire weekend.<br>
<br>
Please use this thread for feedback and bug reports regarding the first wing encounters, or related issues. Noting the nature of your group (Mythic guild premade, PUG, etc.) is helpful, as are any logs.<br>
<br>
Thank you to everyone helps test!<br>

Relics<br>
IN the Q&amp;A you said relics would be throughput, yet all the rogue relics that drop off BS bosses are cloak, sprint etc<br>
We dropped our preliminary &quot;second bonus trait&quot; plan. As always, the base properties of Relics span the entire range of available traits. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/855485386876895232))<br>

Good day indeed, how do you feel about the 50% dampening games?<br>
Don&apos;t like it. We&apos;ll spend a lot of time looking into it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/856212494661976064))<br>
Do you feel like that causes another problem by making meta/balance changes with tournaments around the corner?<br>
Yup. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/856214204830818304))<br>
