A new Hearthstone expansion is on the way, featuring Dr. Boom (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dr._Boom)! It&apos;ll be ready on August 7 2018.<br>
<br>
<br>
Magnetic Minions can be played on their own, but if you have a mech on the board you can play a Magnetic minion and fuse it to the mech to add to its health, attack, and add an ability. <br>
Projects are new spell cards with extremely powerful effects, but they help both players.<br>
Omega Project - These cards are normal, but have a Battlecry that works when you have 10 Mana Crystals.<br>
There will be legendary spells, such as one that draws your entire deck!<br>
