The answer is probably in the new ilvl 232 uncommon armor sets + weapons (http://db.mmo-champion.com/items/?level=232&amp;quality=2) introduced a while back on Patch 4.3 PTRs. However, this is pure speculation and we should probably sit tight and wait for the official announcement.<br>

Scroll of Resurrection Revamp - Free lvl 80 Character and more!<br>
The new Scroll of Resurrection revamp seems to be on live servers and includes a free level 80 character and a free character/faction change for the person you&apos;re bringing back to the game! We will probably get more information from Blizzard very soon.<br>
<br>
We can only assume that the Spectral Gryphon and Spectral Wyvern Mounts teaser (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2668-Cataclysm-Post-Mortem-Dungeons-and-Raids-Darkmoon-Faire-Issues-MMO-Report) from yesterday means people doing the recruiting also get nice perks.<br>
