Warlords of Draenor - Alliance Faction Hub: Stormshield
The latest beta build updated the Alliance faction hub outside of Ashran, making it significantly larger.

Warlords of Draenor - Alliance Guard Armor Set
If you were looking closely at the Stormspear screenshots, you may have noticed that the guard armor sets were updated to fit in with all of the higher resolution textures. Unfortunately it looks like this set won't be available to players.


  



Tanaan Jungle in a Future Content Patch
It looks like Tanaan Jungle will not have additional content until a later content patch other than the intro experience.
I believe you missed the post where Frostfire will have Alliance quests and Shadowmoon will have Horde quests at Level 100.
It's not just Frostfire and Shadowmoon. Most Draenor zones have additional content at level 100. For example, there's a bunch of content involving Shattrath at level 100 that we alluded to in the recent Talador preview:

Even once the Iron Horde is routed out of Shattrath, the city will not remain safe for long, as new foes are waiting to emerge and lay claim to the city. The Sargerai are a sect of draenei who have aligned themselves with the Shadow Council to usher Gul’dan’s twisted schemes into fruition.
As to Tanaan, the rest of the zone has always been planned as patch content. The area past the Dark Portal is where the Iron Horde has amassed the majority of its army and resources. Naturally, it's going to take some time for the Alliance and Horde to prepare to assault that directly.


  

So with Tanaan being pushed back what is the level 100 content then? Aside from 5s, raids, and pvp.
There is level 100 content in most zones. Tanaan as patch content has always been the plan. Lore 
Seeing that Tanaan is pushed back, will Farahlon still get released later in a patch cycle?
Tanaan isn't "pushed back". Plan has always been go through dark portal -> escape -> come back later to finish the job. Lore 
You told us that faction hubs were moving to Ashran "to be near iron horde in Tanaan". Pointless when can't enter it.
We're going to attack them. Just should probably build up an army first. Lore 
It has not been said before that Tanaan isn't live in 6.0 - new decision or new information for us?
Not a new decision. Perhaps not communicated clearly. We haven't talked much about content patches post-6.0. which is entirely because we're primarily focused on 6.0 itself at the moment Lore 
Maybe you should communicate these decisions when they are made?
I believe this one was made prior to Blizzcon. Either way, point taken - we need to do better. Lore

Raid Testing Schedule - July 28
On Monday, July 28, we will continue Warlords raid testing. As this is early in the overall beta raid testing cycle, it is quite possible that there will be technical or gameplay issues that disrupt the testing. Thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.

Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Our general plan is to test every encounter on Heroic difficulty first, and then test sections of the raid on Normal and Raid Finder, alongside targeted Mythic tests.

Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below on all Beta servers.

Monday, July 28
Oregorger - Heroic Blackrock Foundry
10:30 PDT 13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST

Twin Ogron - Heroic Highmaul
16:00 PDT 19:00 EDT, 01:00 CEST

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, fire, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.

One at a more EU-friendly time, one a bit more NA-friendly. We've been doing 10:30am/4pm test days for years now. As we ramp up the testing, we'll fit more tests in between those times - ultimately, our test schedule also reflects things like designer availability and other conflicts that may exist internally. The aim of the schedule is to maximize the amount of information we're able to gather and absorb firsthand during the testing windows. 

I realize the times aren't and can't be convenient for a number of people, but that's the nature of raid testing.

QuoteSTARTIf our toons aren't level 100 will we still be able to use the level 100 talents?
Yes. You will need to re-spend your point after dying and releasing, however. We're working on a fix for that, but it may be a little while coming.


Beta Server Renaming - July 24th
In an effort to make it clearer which Beta realms should be used for which types of testing, we’ll be renaming the current Beta realms with today’s maintenance. The realms are being renamed as follows:

Lost Isles PvE is being renamed to Beta Leveling Realm 01
Gilneas PvP is being renamed to Beta Leveling Realm 02
Mekkatorque PvP is being renamed to Level 100 PvP

As a result of the rename, some interface settings such as combat log filters, or add-on configurations may be lost, and will need to be reconfigured. Your existing Beta characters will still be accessible, you’ll just need to select the new realm name from the realm select list once the servers become available.


Beta Realms Character Wipe
In preparation for the next beta build that is planned to go live July 25, we will be doing a character wipe on the beta realms. Once the new build is live, you will also notice that the realms have been renamed, and that you will be able to create level 100 PvP and PvE characters. For more information about the new realm names, check out the thread Lore recently posted here.

EDIT: Apologies for any confusion; characters are being wiped from the beta realms today.

Question: Which servers will we be able to make level 100 PvE characters on?
There will be a new server brought up called, aptly enough, "Level 100 PvE." It might not come up immediately when maintenance finishes, but we plan to have it ready for the next round of raid testing at the latest.


 US Connected Realms - Update 7/25
As previously announced, we’ve been working toward connecting realms to increase the number of players on low-population realms. Here's a continuously updated list that contains currently planned connections, future plans, and completed realm connections, all in one convenient location.

Character Viewer Updated: Undead Male!
The character viewer  on our our Warlords of Draenor website has been updated once more, this time the undead male model  has been added.


      

Our art team and character artists worked themselves to the bone to bring new unlife to this scion of the Forsaken while retaining the creepy qualities of the classic model. We hope you enjoy it!

We’ll show you even more of the updated character models coming in Warlords of Draenor as development continues.


Claiming the Horde Chopper
I logged in and voted... I'm not angry, just confused on how to get it! Any help would be appreciated, thank you 
If you've logged in between now and September 30 you've claimed it! There's no confirmation provided to players in the game, but rest assured that we'll be pulling login data to verify who will be receiving the mount when it becomes available. 

Do you need to log into a horde character? or will you be registered if you log into an alliance character?
The faction of the character you log into doesn't matter. As long as you log in the mount will be awarded to your account when it's available, allowing you to ride it on Horde characters.

To be clear, you just have to log-in to the game? You didn't have to vote or even watch this whole Choppers thing?
That's correct.

Are you guys happy with the state that the non DK and Druid tanks are?
No. Celestalon

Re: Conversion RP costIt's a beta; sometimes we make mistakes, like swapping the intended costs between specs. Celestalon 
Did you intend costs to be 10/15/20 RP/sec for Frost/Blood/Unholy respectively? Would sync w/Darkedge&Mendenbarr's theorycraft.
Yes, though we aren't positive that those are perfect. In particular, the ideal numbers for DW vs 2H Frost are different. Celestalon 

How about for conversion, "For every 20/15/10 runic power you spend, you regenerate 1% health"?
That's an extremely different talent. Not looking to change its purpose. Celestalon 
Problem in MoP is that the damage cost isn't worth the healing gain for PVE DPS ever. What's going to change this in WoD?
If patchwerk DPS, with zero regard for self healing, is your goal, then Conversion is not for you. It's in the name. Celestalon 

Conversion costs 1 Frost Strike per tick despite all the Math showing why that would be silly, why not remove it entirely?
I'd like to see how you're comparing the value of damage to healing. Celestalon 

Death pact is not only cheaper, but also counters bursts by being burst healing. Not a real choice.
Conversion will never fill the role of burst healing; that's not its purpose. Celestalon 

have you guys ever not massively overdone nerfs? 20 RP per tick on conversion? are u being serious?
Have you ever not massively overdone hyperbole? Yes. It's a beta. We try things. Celestalon 
With respect, though he didn't put it well his comment is sound, Frost does not generate 2x the RP of UH 1/2
The goal is an equal DPS loss, not an equal RPS loss Celestalon 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
If MM's aoe isn't getting an extra gimmick which I'm not sure it needs w Chimera change can Bombardment be buffed?
Yes to both of your questions. Improved Multi-Shot: Multi-Shot costs 5 less Focus and deals 20% increased damage. Celestalon 

New Chimaera Shot breaks people out of CC when attacking others close by, intended?
Yes. Don't use it if you don't want to cleave. Celestalon 
Why should we be forced to leave out an ability if the enemy team sticks around the CC target? I'm disliking this change to CS.
Adjusting your ability usage to not break CC is hardly unique. Many specs do that. Howling Blast, for example. Celestalon 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Prismatic Crystal is useless for older content because damage against it is Draenor-level. Do 30k to the crystal, 500k to mobs.
The Crystal's damage should get the damage multiplier against low level targets. Celestalon

a recent poll on forums revealed 60% of players don't like the Ascendance model. I'd much prefer to play my Orc

Can't you just place WS on the standard gcd? It's aids for anyone above 180ms. Make it 10 rage and bring back an off gcd dump.
We're totally open to other ideas, but we're simply not planning to go back to having two rage dumps. Celestalon 
I agree with everyone else, axe WS and bring back HS. Make everyone happy.
I've tweeted about why that option in particular is not what you want, and would be really bad. Celestalon 

Is Arms stable now? Current rotation is: Keep up Rend, CS and MS on CDs, WW as dump, correct? Is there a new Mastery on the way?
Arms already got a new Mastery, that we're satisfied with. Celestalon

can we expect a lantern or torch since night's are going to be darker?
Nope. You won't need them. Celestalon 

PvP
Uh-oh. Tell me the generals in Ashran aren't the -only- conquest vendors, because that will get aggravating very quick.
Oh yes! Defend your base! holinka 
That's...very questionable design-wise. Not all of us who PvP want to World PvP.
This is probably the most defended those vendors have ever been. holinka 

Each 'battle' ends at the end of reinforcements right? If so, the current amount if way too short.
Yeah we will have to scale it based on zone population. holinka 

is that a Payload race reference at the Stadium? The racing Direhorns event
Yes the more of your faction near your racer, the faster they go holinka 

Concerned about Ashran. Looked like one faction was just getting farmed by the end.
We definitely have a faction balance issue on beta. Definitely something we're discussing. Don't want that experience live. holinka 

For the love of all that is holy, PLEASE reconsider the Ashran capitals! We want Karabor/BSF!
You really don't. What would you do with an auction house there? Be bored and far from any fun activities. Muffinus 
We would be connected to Draenor and not concerned with Horde PvPers messing up our day with being so close to the PvP zone.
For the 100% official record, your Ashran hub is NOT part of the Ashran BG, it's on your server and separate. Muffinus 
I realize this. What I also realize is that the PvPers on my server will still invade and kill everyone, which is not fun.
Then we will bump up the guards and give you a N.U.K.U.L.A.R. weapon. Whatever it takes. Muffinus 


Russian and EU Players and Battlegrounds
I dislike having to fight someone who drops target and warps across the playing field because his connection is too bad to play WoW, either intentionally or unintentionally. This is especially annoying as rogue, which has to be behind the target to do damage.
The lag is something we have seen reported by some players, and we're looking into. 

Although Cyrillic characters are a big improvement from the original ????? that used to show up for Russian names, we're also passing on your feedback about the Cyrillic text. However, remember that Russian players see your Latin text names which they won't always recognise either, so they face exactly the same disadvantages.

You know, every time most of us get into a ,supposedly random, battleground and its versus russians..most people just want to leave straight away. This is because of the following reasons:

1. They all speak the same language, where as the 'english' realms do not, having a multitude of languages spoken. Latin is atleast in the same alphabet as the 'english' languages, cyrilic is not.
This is something that only affects English realms, French, German etc. obviously don't have this issue. Having said that, the vast majority of players that opt to play on 'English' realms do speak English, at least enough to get by in a BG. Many of you believe Russians can understand English just fine—if that's true the same should also apply to people playing on EN realms. More so in fact, because for the most part our "motley crew" all shares the same alphabet.

2. Cyrillic is unreadable for the majority of the players. i'd guess only countries near russia and 1% of other players would be able to read russian. This makes it impossible to targetcall and report for cheating once they are out of sight or in stealth again. 
Yup, I've noted your issues with Cyrillic characters. I'll also point out though that target calling by name is problematic, not just against Russian players. You'll often come across characters with names such as "Uaaxjuuooc" yeah I just made that up but you get the point. In theory, you could face a group of European players with names like this, or even names that are the same, with accents being the only difference Dkrulez & Dkrúlez. Point is, unpronounceable names are not something that are exclusive to Russians vs Europeans. With all that said, I will of course continue to bring this up.

3. Russian teams are nearly always premades who have full prideful and are, once again mentioning it, are much more organised wheras the 'english' groups are not. This is unsolveable as a random group will more likely than not just not listen to any given person, even if this person clearly has for example a prestigious pvp title. 
As others have already pointed out, Russian players don't have access to any advantage that European players do not in terms of game features. They're organised and they often go into BGs with friends, just as good European players do.

4. The fact that when you leave, you get a 5 minute deserter buff that goes up every time you leave is quite unfair simply because we are getting punished for not wanting to get farmed like crops in the summer which happens regularly against those teams. 
You'll get a debuff if you desert a game against Russians or any other European group. Russian players also get a debuff when they desert a BG, too. Not sure how this is a disadvantage for Europeans specifically facing Russians.

Lastly i'd like to say that i hope the European blizzard-people who are in charge of this are aware of this glaring problem that hits so many of us who enjoyed pvp up untill this......change. This merger hasn't brought any fun to pvp and has infact drained it from the 'english' groups and pumped it straight into the russian ones, since they are probably and judging from the rude emotes of them against enemy corpses laughing and enjoying slaughtering the unorganised mass of people that blizzard decided to put up against them. Frankly, i don't think many people would mind a slightly longer queue if it means to no longer go up against russian premades.
I've seen and passed on your feedback, and that from others who share your views, yes. I've also seen feedback from players who enjoy the changes this has brought to PvP. Russian teams have certain tactics which Europeans certainly found challenging at first, but the tide is definitely turning...

But to turn Takralus question the other way instead of asking us what the disadvantages are. What are the advantages of doing so that can outweigh the Cyrillic problem. Is there perhaps a pilot period. Let's see how it goes got x months and if there are many negative reports turn it back as easily
The queue advantage is quite a big one. Some of you haven't noticed much of a difference but there was a huge improvement for others.

ding ding ding! we've reached a 100 pages of unsatisfied customer feedback! time to split up russian and european realms! admit your mistake and move on blizzard Europe! 
A large portion of the comments in this thread, especially in the last few pages, were discussions between the same handful of people who are for and against Russian vs. European battlegrounds, which hardly matches your description. 

We're continuing to monitor the situation, not just for EN but all the other European languages. Thanks to everyone for taking the time to give your thoughts. If you could keep it on-topic and avoid personal arguments though, I would very much appreciate it
