A lot of people are interested in the pandarens, here's a special news just for the panda lovers out there. 



Character creation is definitely a work in progress, and so far only the females have the red panda + tail variation. We'll track any update in future patches.
Emotes are also in progress, the female is still missing a lot of them but it's perfectly normal in early stages of the beta. No dance yet. 


You should definitely check the emotes video at least, the art work on Pandaren animations is pretty impressive and look like they will be a refreshing change.
