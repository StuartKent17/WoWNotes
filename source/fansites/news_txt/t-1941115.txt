Been wondering this for a while Purpleform =/= Shadowform. 
Shadowform's visual in the alpha is not complete - we are still working on it. WarcraftDevs 

Lore
Fel was called the language of chaos and chaotic energy. In what sense is fel chaotic? Is it chaotic in the sense that it leaves creatures infused with it in a state less orderly? Is it chaotic in the sense that fel energies moves chaotically, lashing out? Perhaps both?
perhaps both, if titans speak the language of order, and Sargeras is the great unmaker, he seeks disorder/entropy, his magic too Muffinus 

How exactly can Gul'dan and friends summon Sargeras? The Burning Legion had Archimonde, Hakkar, Xavius, and many Highborne struggling to summon Sargeras even though they had the Demon Soul, the OP Well of Eternity, and 3 Old Gods helping them. Seems kinda unrealistic that Sargeras can actually be summoned now. In no way can a portal exist that is big enough to allow Sargeras entry.
Sargeras has tried to invade Azeroth many times. Gul'dan is building on previous work. Re:Tomb of Sergeras DaveKosak 

RE: the mogu. do you think that now Lei Shen is dead and Ra-Den is lurking about, that they would return to his side and try to "serve" him once more? maybe he could teach them how to you know, not be assholes to everybody else.
Hard to say - they're no longer stone automatons. DaveKosak
