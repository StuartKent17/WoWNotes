<br>
The Process<br>
<br>
The in game story is planned out months and sometimes years in advance.<br>
Cinematics have always functioned as an important point in a story in Blizzard games&apos; history, and it started with the Wrathgate in WoW.<br>
The game can create good ambient story, but cinematics shine in telling the more emotional story points.<br>
<br>
Story in Battle for Azeroth<br>
<br>
Bfa was a good opportunity to bring Jaina back into the story and develop all the different experiences she has had throughout the story.<br>
People have strong feelings about the state of the Horde right now, and the conflict allows good storytelling and depth to develop.<br>
The two philosophies of honor and conquest is the core of the ongoing story within the Horde.<br>
Zekhan was already planned to be in Old Soldier as Saurfang&apos;s counterpart before players fell in love with him.<br>
Bwonsamdi was influenced a lot by how his voice actor embodied him.<br>
Christie Golden wrote the dialogue for the Bwonsamdi and Rastakhan cinematic.<br>
There will be a lot more interaction between Talanji and Bwonsamdi going forward.<br>
Flynn was super fun to develop as a counterpart to Talia.<br>
<br>
Cinematics and Cutscenes<br>
<br>
Prior cinematics were pretty self contained, but as the story has progressed, a lot of cinematics have bridged to the next.<br>
The team has weekly meetings where multiple departments discuss the cinematics being developed and how to improve them.<br>
Cataclysm was when a lot of the new cutscene technology was developed and this is why there are a lot of in game scenes (Uldum) because they team had a new toy that they ran wild with.<br>
The Terror of Darkshore cutscene was a moment to show the ferocity of the night elves seen in past games.<br>
<br>
Customization<br>
<br>
The night warrior customization was a way for players to support Tyrande&apos;s transformation and vengeance for Teldrassil.<br>
Golden eyed Blood Elves was a story choice to represent the light&apos;s role in the cleansing of the Sunwell.<br>
<br>
Storytelling<br>
<br>
The team wanted to let the player have some agency in the direction of the Horde and not just watching it develop.<br>
Perspective has a major role in storytelling. There can be a difference between a character making a mistake and a write making one.<br>
The Saurfang quest is not necessarily fundamentally changing the questing system of the game, but it was a moment to add meaningful choices to the story. <br>
Choices will be used when it makes sense to create a more invested story.<br>
The payoff for your choices will be meaningful.<br>
There are moments in the Battle for Dazar&apos;alor that haven&apos;t been seen yet. Terran showed off his Mekkatorque shirt with a &quot;hint hint&quot; when he said this.<br>
Olds Gods and Azshara are coming!<br>
The war between the Horde and Alliance will culminate in something deep and meaningful.<br>
There is so much passion and love for the characters on the team and they want to do right by them.<br>
Christie Golden coming on board was a huge win for the story team.<br>
The team hopes that when Battle for Azeroth&apos;s story concludes and the &quot;last funeral pyre is lit&quot; players will have seen it as a great story that changed the world of Azeroth.</div></div>
