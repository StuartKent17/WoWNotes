is it intended for other classes to be able to enter the rogue order hall?<br>
No, that&apos;s just an Alpha issue. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674341710948773889))<br>
<br>
Is the Garona in the Rogues Class hall the original timeline Garona? Or the Garona that became our follower?<br>
This is the original timeline&apos;s Garona. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674341874052689920))<br>

Items<br>
have a question about teleport items and northrend. Will Dalaran still exist there for porting. IE ring of Kirin Tor/Locket.<br>
The items given out in Northrend will continue to send you to the Northrend version of Dalaran. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674342032987459584))<br>

Ion, thought you might want to know that Apocalypse (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/128403-apocalypse)&apos;s flavor text is wrong. You guys meant sow and not sew, right?<br>
Hey, it&apos;s been known to crochet some seriously violent tapestries in its day. (Ok, ok....) (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/674282443944411137))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
are you a little bored at your current job? Honest question, not trolling. It seems you had your hands full at Blizz<br>
At Blizzard, I did some actual implementation work, fixed bugs and so on. I never have time for that any more, which is a bit sad. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672125954962030593))<br>
<br>
Any of you guys ever used calculus as part of a game design project? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672125233550127104))<br>
I recall a couple instances of calc, but it&apos;s super rare. Not necessary, IMO. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672128513726484480))<br>
I have a math degree and I rarely use calc, why don&apos;t we teach stats in HS...<br>
I would support teaching stats not calculus in HS! Where do I sign? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672168144782266369))<br>
<br>
I remember doing differential equations on my design test. (hwoome (https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/672117689318432768))<br>
I certainly didn&apos;t ask them! (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672125272120909824))<br>
Haha. It was the question about ArPen. I really just used it as an excuse. (hwoome (https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/672130374164545537))<br>
