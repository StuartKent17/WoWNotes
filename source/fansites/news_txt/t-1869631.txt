Armory Stats - Battle Pet Collection
It Pet Battle Bonus Weekend, so we are starting by taking a look at the battle pet ownership achievement completion rate of players. Today's data is from 2.1 million players not characters that were active after August 1st.

You can see some of the same data to compare to last time we looked at pet battle stats, two years ago 

Keep in mind that the Safari achievements  require you to collect every pet on that continent. The Raiding with Leashes achievements  require collection of every pet that drops from different raid bosses. Crazy for Cats  and Celestial Family  require collecting specific pets.

Mythic Dungeons don't count as dungeons for guild challenges while in a guild group? Intended?
Not ideal, but a consequence of how the system was originally built. Challenges require queued dungeon activities LFG only. WarcraftDevs 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Except the "alternative" is always substantially less rewarding, so it will never be cared about. You can't just offer easy vs hard with the same rewards. Nobody will opt into hard "just because". 

How can you be so sure? I always choose the hardest difficulty without knowing if I'll get better rewards
The comment was specifically about group PvE content. If you offer 5 difficulty levels, all with the same rewards, and don't provide easy ways for other players to see others' accomplishments, then my experience is most players will see no point in suffering through the harder difficulties. Some will, but my expectation is that group will be small. In general, if players do more challenging content, they expect rewards appropriate for their accomplishment. Those rewards could be power based rewards, or they could just be recognition from other players.

This doesn't mean players don't like difficult content. I like difficult content. But generally in multiplayer games, players want some recognition or outright rewards that they did it the hard way. I think the mindset is just different in single player games. I play Dark Souls because I gain satisfaction over beating it. It's harder to lean on personal satisfaction in a multiplayer game where players spend a lot of brain space comparing their accomplishments to others. In multiplayer games, the social element is typically pretty massive or it wouldn't be a multiplayer game. Recognition, in my experience, is an important part of that social element. 


Poll - How Many Battle Pets Do You Have?
Please vote with the number of unique pets you have. You can get a fairly accurate count by checking the pets section of your armory profile
