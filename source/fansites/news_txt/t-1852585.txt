Patch 6.2 Hotfixes - August 25
Raids and Dungeons
Hellfire Citadel

Archimonde

Fixed an issue where Archimonde was not spawning on Raid Finder difficulty.
Defeating Archimonde on Raid Finder should no longer prevent players from being eligible to obtain Crystallized Fel if they defeat Archimonde again later that week on Normal, Heroic, or Mythic difficulty.



Hellfire Citadel - Raid Finder Wing 5
The final wing of Raid Finder difficulty Hellfire Citadel opened this week, allowing players to kill Archimonde.

Flying
why are raiders and pvpers left grounded when it comes to Draenor Pathfinder?
Counter-question: If you're only interested in raids, battlegrounds, or arenas, why do you care about flying in the open world? CM_Lore 
If you want to fly, we want you to earn it - just like you earn gear, or titles, or basically everything else in the game. Earning flying - which is world content - through PvP would be just as weird as earning PvP gear through daily quests. CM_Lore 
so like when i earned my first 310% speed flying mount through PvP, that was weird?
That was also... what, 3 expansions ago? CM_Lore 
what's your point? flight has never been restricted to a single playstyle in the past, why now?
We want flight to be a reward, not something you spend some gold on once you hit max level. And we want earning that reward to involve doing content that's directly relevant to flight. CM_Lore 
are you saying that players should be bored and frustrated to "earn" something we've already enjoyed for 8+ years?
I'm saying if you don't want to put in the minimal effort that's required to earn flying, then you won't get it. That's fine. I haven't done the rep grinds either. If I don't get flying, that's my own fault. CM_Lore 
the main thing i'm getting from you guys is that you think flying is only relevant to world PvEers. and that just isn't true.
Not at all. We just want it to be something you earn, and world PvE is the best fit for it. CM_Lore 
I mean, could you imagine the uproar if for instance you couldn't ding 110 without winning 10 arena matches?
That's exactly my point though. Earning Draenor flight through PvP makes just as much sense as earning Conquest gear from raids. CM_Lore 
you guys put so much work into making Draenor beautiful, and fixing it to be be flyable. Why deny us the opportunity to see it?
We're not denying anyone anything. You're perfectly capable of doing a few daily quests. I get that you don't personally enjoy dailies. Working toward rewards is the core of what makes MMORPGs special, imo. CM_Lore 
but shouldn't gameplay be fun as well?
Sure, but different people enjoy different things. There's always going to be rewards you want behind content you don't like. I would love to have the monument with the Cinder Kitten on it in my Garrison, but I don't enjoy Pet Battles, so I don't get it. CM_Lore 
those should not be gated behind lengthy, boring grinds which alienate PvPers
I think if you honestly care this much about flying, it's perfectly reasonable for us to ask you to do some basic world content. CM_Lore 
"i think if you care this much about the legendary, it's perfectly reasonable for us to ask you to do a few BGs"
Eh, I think asking a raider to do a BG is a much bigger ask than asking a raider to do a few daily quests. CM_Lore 
what about asking a PvPer to do dailies? I think you're way underestimating how much I haaaaate them
My dislike for dailies has been very well documented over the years. I've just been poking at them once or twice a week. CM_Lore 

PvP
If you struggle to find people to play WoW with, you aren't alone. Ranked solo Q please
I'm curious: what would be the difference between a ranked solo queue and the current unrated queue? Better rewards? 10v10 maps? Just having a visible rating? CM_Lore 
Solo 3s queue would be awesome. Something to do when no one is on. Healer/melee/range team templates
What would be different from 3v3 Skirmishes? CM_Lore 
visible rating, competition, conquest. I queue solo skirms all the time; but I can 2v3 in them.
The challenge is, if rated solo queue exists, what keeps it from just replacing skirms entirely? CM_Lore 

Developer Communication
What they're doing with the site for Star Citizen blogs, updates, progress, etc. How feasible would this be for Blizzard to do?
There's a few challenges. Biggest is prob. that those updates still take a LOT of dev time, even when Community writes them. Ultimately we'd rather they spend more of their time making content than they do talking about content they'd like to make. Star Citizen's approach is interesting, but I'd be curious to know how much it hinders development. I also think they do a lot of over-promising, which makes sense for a Kickstarter model, but we're trying very hard to avoid. CM_Lore 
Star Citizen also has a different development model due to being tied to the responsibilities of crowdfunding money.
Yeah, exactly. It's worth it for them, as talking about features they'd like to do directly increases their funding. We have a much higher risk of *losing* funding ie: subs due to failing to fulfill promises. CM_Lore 

I feel like that balancing question -- how much of my job should be communication? -- gets asked in many industries.
Yep. We obviously have a communications department for that, but still need to work with devs to share info. CM_Lore
