Greetings all,<br>
<br>
PTR realms have begun to spin down in order to deploy a new 7.2.0 build this afternoon. No ETA for today&apos;s push but I&apos;ll ping this thread if things look like they&apos;re going to take longer than usual (~4-6 hours).<br>
<br>
I&apos;ll leave this thread open for discussion so long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines. <br>
<br>
Thanks everyone!<br>
