As I said last week, the &quot;static content&quot; updates on the site are coming, don&apos;t worry, it just needs a little more time.<br>
<br>
Movies list aren&apos;t up for the moment because I couldn&apos;t access warcraftmovies earlier (thanks to my provider !). They&apos;ll be up today or during the night. <br>
