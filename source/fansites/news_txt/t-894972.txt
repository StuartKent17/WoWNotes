Blizzard released a preview of the legendary staff: Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest. The model we datamined a few weeks ago was apparently a very early version of the staff and it was revamped considerably since the first time we saw the model. You can still recognize a few features of the original staff such as the Eye Stage 2, 3, and 4. 
Ever since the death of the Dragon Aspect Malygos, the blue dragonflight has struggled with appointing a new leader. Its members are now torn between the two likeliest successors: Kalecgos, who champions reconciliation with other races; and Arygos, a scion of Malygos who believes that his kind should withdraw from the world and forge a new path. To end the constant debates and arguments, the flight has agreed to gather during the Embrace—an extraordinary celestial event in which Azeroth's two moons come into perfect alignment—in the hopes that a new Aspect will be selected.

Yet a recent discovery by the bronze dragon Anachronos bodes ill for this impending ceremony. The timeless dragon has detected sinister magic at work around the Nexus, the blue flight's frozen lair in Northrend. Along with this find, he has glimpsed a terrifying vision of Azeroth succumbing to flames. The link between this chilling portent and the blue dragons remains unclear, but Anachronos has called upon what some of his kind deem the "short-lived" races to investigate further. If a hero does not rise to the challenge and find the truth, Anachronos's dire vision of Azeroth's undoing could become reality.

Patch 4.2 introduces an epic quest that will challenge those daring enough to complete the legendary staff Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest. The great staff duplicates destructive magics, and also bestows upon its wielder the ability to transform into a member of the Blue Dragonflight. Those who complete the staff won’t be the only ones to receive a reward, though. As this task requires the dedication of an entire guild, upon completion of the staff all guild members will receive a unique non-combat pet to call their own.

Behold the legendary staff Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest. Players will need to embark on an epic questline to obtain and upgrade this powerful weapon.

Only those who have emerged triumphant against the evils lurking within Blackwing Descent, The Bastion of Twilight, and the Throne of the Four Winds will be eligible to begin the legendary quest. Bronze Dragonflight emissaries will be sent to the Alliance and Horde capital cities of Stormwind and Orgrimmar to recruit those who are ready to undertake the challenge.

This is not a path to be undertaken lightly. Be warned: the way forward is deadly, the first steps are perilous, and the destination, as yet, unfathomable. The journey will take willing challengers across continents and through time; to meet with ancient beings, to be recognized as one of the most powerful entities on Azeroth; to navigate a lethal web of politics and determine the shape of the future.

While the journey will certainly require progress through the Firelands, where guilds will need to work together to topple the forces of Ragnaros, there are times where those seeking the staff will have to stand alone in order to prove their skill, knowledge, and determination.

The Bronze Dragonflight is counting on you. The Blue Dragonflight may lose its way without your guidance. Best not keep them waiting.
