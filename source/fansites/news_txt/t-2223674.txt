Missing frost trait Relic in Tomb. Any reasons? Howling Blast relic havent been in raid since EN.
There’s a Shadow relic with the trait you’re looking for, dropped by a boss whose name rhymes with "Lil Maiden ". WarcraftDevs 

7.2 patch notes says you can right click class tokens to give you a set item. Not working with ICC tokens. Intended or bug?
This is intended. The ICC tokens are valid for multiple slots, so you'll still visit the vendor to choose the one you want. WarcraftDevs 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
What are your thoughts on creating/designing rewards around the top % of players? As a player it feels like developers are afraid of making exclusive rewards in games hard to obtain, or only available for a short period of time, as the remaining x% majority of playerbase will never get to obtain said rewards. Which leads to a lot of the coolest rewards being easily attainable, thus making getting a really cool skin, or mount not feel rewarding as it was trivial to get, and everyone has it.
I’m a big fan of exclusive, prestige rewards for the best players. Having something that aspirational has benefits I believe even for players who have little chance of ever earning them.

That said, I don’t think it’s the right design to have great rewards for the best players and only hopes and dreams for everyone else.

If you unpack player motivations for earning a piece of content, they usually fall out into buckets like this:


I want to show off what a bad ass I am.
I want to express what kind of player I am.
The content has power and I need it to stay competitive.
It’s something fun.


Bullet 1 is definitely there to serve the top percent of players. Bullet 2 is less about recognition and more about communicating to other players about who I am. I’d be careful about locking those kind of rewards away to the top percent. You can get away with locking up a little bit of power under the justification that it gets more relevant at the more competitive upper end of the player base, but you have to be careful. Bullet 4 is where it’s easy to get into trouble where players are just in love with something and not just because it symbolizes achievement. For category 4, I’d make the rewards highly available.

Build of the Month - May 2017
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

All of the parts on this page are Amazon affiliate links. When you purchase your parts through them it helps support the site!

This month
The current SSD prices  are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale.

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 7700K and would get more performance from spending that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions!
