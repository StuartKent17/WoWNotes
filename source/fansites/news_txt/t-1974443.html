FEEDBACK: Il&apos;gynoth (Heroic)<br>
Waaaay too little damage going out in P1.<br>
Yeah, we noticed that immediately once the test began. A recent internal playtest on Mythic had way too much raid damage in P1 (compounded by new Mythic mechanics), and that led to raid damage being tuned down across the board. But of course without the Mythic mechanics present, there&apos;s not much to heal. Whoops.

Will the warlock talent Grim of Synergy work with all Demonology pets or just the summoned/main pet? Would love the former<br>
Only the warlock&apos;s primary demon. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/713432520117780480))<br>
<br>
Will demolocks be losing demonic leap and the glyph of falling meteor in Legion? It&apos;s a nice utility; sad to see it go, if so.<br>
As Warlocks are losing Metamorphosis, these are both gone as well (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/713432705677926400))<br>
<br>
What&apos;s the point of Soul Siphon? It is just a refund on the 2 shards you got from the 2(or more) shards you spent on UA rq&apos;mt<br>
It provides more Soul Shards when dealing spread pressure. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/713434313207906304))<br>

Are enchant illusions staying for #Legion and will we get more options, like the black aura seen on the Fist of Reckoning?<br>
Enchant Illusions will be staying around for #Legion! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/713449545808515072))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
But WoW made a huge change in design philosophy at the exact same time Blizz was bought. Hard to not see a link.<br>
They were unrelated. That direction came from within the team. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/715597541316820996))<br>
we should also note though that, at the time, the team changed as well.<br>
I mean, not dramatically. Kaplan went to his new team with a couple of dudes, but 90% of the team stayed. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/715642628625182720))<br>
Kaplan was around for the heyday of WoW, It seems he maybe took his design philosophy with him?<br>
I&apos;m one of Kaplan&apos;s biggest fans, but he would be the first to tell you that it&apos;s about the team, not the leader. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/715667101260783617))<br>
sure i agree with that. and for the record - you lead wow through some vry hard times.. more gracefully than i would<br>
Players not infrequently confuse &quot;communicates a lot&quot; with &quot;must be in charge.&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/715668475268599808))<br>
<br>
But as a member of the team, why change the design philsophy? It was extremely good and profitable before.<br>
For the non-raiders, leveling alt #6 was starting to lose its luster. Those players had no endgame. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/715667500818509824))<br>
They had dungeons, kinda, but a few new dungeons alone don&apos;t provide months of new content. You exhaust them quickly. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/715667732373446656))<br>

World of Warcraft Takes To The Streets of Europe<br>
On Tuesday, March 29, a group of urban artists from ARTtitude (https://www.facebook.com/arttitudebook) set their sights on London&#x2019;s Shoreditch neighborhood to bring a bit of World of Warcraft&#x2019;s night elf magic to the walls along Great Eastern Street. Check out the video below to see their work come to life.<br>

<br>
These night elf murals will remain in London until April 6, after which time the artists will move on to claim Paris for all of orc kind and Amsterdam for the murloc multitude. The Paris invasion will begin with a live performance at the Paris Comics Expo (http://pariscomicsexpo.fr/en/home/) on April 16, with street art installation taking place over the following days.</div></div>
