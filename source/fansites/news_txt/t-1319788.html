We&#x2019;ve got some new stuff coming to the Pet Store, and we wanted to give everyone a quick sneak peek. Obviously, the Pet Store has been the place where we sell pets and mounts, but we&#x2019;ve come up with some new types of cosmetic goodies, including some fun new little toys and Transmogrifiables.<br>
<br>
First up: a trio of cosmetic helms for Transmogrification. (http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/95474.jpg Jewel of the Firelord (http://www.wowdb.com/items/95474-jewel-of-the-firelord), http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/97213.jpg Hood of Hungering Darkness (http://www.wowdb.com/items/97213-hood-of-hungering-darkness), and http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/95475.jpg Crown of Eternal Winter (http://www.wowdb.com/items/95475-crown-of-eternal-winter)) When Transmog went into the game, people immediately started talking about the possibility of just buying armor looks. So we&#x2019;re going ahead and forging a few helms and seeing how they fit. They don&#x2019;t have any stats, they&#x2019;re just for looks, and you can use them to change the appearance of the helms for any characters of any class or race (they work with all armor types). They&#x2019;re great for spicing up a Transmog set&#x2014;or replacing a tier head piece you hate the looks of. No need to check that &#x2018;Hide Helm&#x2019; box any longer!<br>

<br>
Here are a few images, but keep in mind that these are all special-effecty and animated in a really cool way. You may have even seen these models pop up on Wowhead or MMO-Champion earlier this year.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re also trying out something else new. A lot of people have liked the kinds of fun, limited-use items you can get from the WoW TCG&#x2014;so we&#x2019;re taking that idea to the Pet Store. Soon you&#x2019;ll be able to snag two fun new little toys: the http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/97994.jpg Seesaw (http://www.wowdb.com/items/97994-seesaw) and http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/98549.jpg Iron Hitching Post (http://www.wowdb.com/items/98549-iron-hitching-post)!<br>
<br>
You can jump on the http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/97994.jpg Seesaw (http://www.wowdb.com/items/97994-seesaw) with a party member and relive the childhood glee of trying to slam your friend into the ground . . . or you can have a big ogre named Lunk launch them into the air. Really, though, you&#x2019;ll probably just look super cute gazing lovingly into each other&#x2019;s eyes. D&#x2019;awwwww.<br>

True story: Worgen are exactly the same weight as Ogres.<br>
<br>
The http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/98549.jpg Iron Hitching Post (http://www.wowdb.com/items/98549-iron-hitching-post) is a little different: It&#x2019;s an item you set down that allows you and up to 24 of your closest raiding cohorts to each jump on your own new unearthly Iron Warhorse (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/142910-iron-warhorse) mount. You can use it for smaller parties too, and it&#x2019;s also great for Battlegrounds. Imagine the look on your opponents&#x2019; faces when they see a unified front of ghost horses galloping toward them . . . just to ruin everything and capture Snowfall Graveyard. (STOP IT!)<br>

Hyah ghost-steed! Later I&#x2019;ll feed you some ghost-oats in the ghost-barn.<br>
<br>
We don&#x2019;t have specific release dates for any of these items yet, but you can expect to see them show up in the Pet Store in the near future.<br>
