Zandalari Island Area Preview<br>
In previous posts (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219519-the-zandalari/), on the Blizzcon Pandaria map (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/pp04.jpg), and in interviews (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1099149-Mists-of-Pandaria-Press-Tour-Official-FAQ), a Zandalari Island off the coast of Pandaria has been mentioned, which might be the unlabeled island (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/april/worldMapIsland.jpg) in the northwest corner of the current World Map. <br>
<br>
Important - As usual, this is WORK IN PROGRESS. The screenshots and video do not reflect the final version of the area.<br>

Cloud Serpent Questing Area<br>
A previous interview mentioned that you would be able to raise your own cloud serpent through ~20 days of daily quests, which would involve things like racing. One area of Jade Forest has trainers, cloud serpents in training, race spectators, and an island right off the coast with level 90 mobs and an instructor. <br>
<br>
There are also several NPCs that mention joining the training program after you have some more experience. One of the NPCs in this area of The Arboretum has a quest that is not accessible yet at level 87. It is likely that this area will be the area you do some of the Cloud Serpent questing in.<br>

Leaders of Azeroth: Velen Short Story Now Available<br>
Not long ago, the prophet Velen and a number of draenei resettled on Azeroth, hoping to put a halt to the Legion&#x2019;s murderous activities in Outland. Sensing great courage in the Alliance, the draenei pledged themselves to this noble faction.<br>
<br>
Yet much time has passed since then. The Legion&apos;s forces in Outland have been greatly diminished. Now, Velen must guide his people into an uncertain future and decide what role, if any, the draenei will play in the Alliance.<br>
<br>
The Seat of the Naaru&apos;s soaring energies inspired inner peace from the most bloodthirsty of warrior pilgrims, awe from even the most jaded of Azeroth&apos;s inhabitants. The figure floating before the Seat had long taken comfort from this column of Light. Velen looked out from his meditation chamber, seeking insight. . . in all the connections, great and small, where he might perceive the lines of the future. For the past several months, those lines had increasingly felt fragmented.<br>
<br>
As the Prophet of the draenei meditated -- his legs crossed beneath him, his hands resting on his ancient knees -- the crystals that reflected his energies glowed and pulsed and swirled around him, not in patterns but in chaos. And the visions, the endless possibilities of tomorrows, assaulted him.<br>

Blizzard Entertainment is proud to present the latest entry in the &quot;Leaders of Azeroth&quot; short story series: Prophet&apos;s Lesson (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/leader-story/velen/1)! <br>
