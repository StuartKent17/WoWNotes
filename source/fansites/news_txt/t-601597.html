Blizzcon is next week, the first bunch of official informations will probably be released tomorrow once everybody is back to work. I&apos;ll ask people to not post fakes features list, skills list, etc on the forums (Already deleted 2 of them today, don&apos;t make me look like I work). They&apos;re all fake, we&apos;re 6 months away from the release of the expansion and everyone thinking that Blizzard already have precise skills list available is a fool.<br>
All the Blizzcon informations will be reported on the site as soon as they&apos;re released. Stay tuned next week. <br>

Jokes<br>
There is a WoW-Joke post going on the forum. Some of them are pretty good, and if you&apos;re bored this sunday, you might want to waste a few minutes reading them.<br>

Website<br>
This week we had a few server issues, with the site being slow a few times, etc ... This should be fixed next week and I hope you won&apos;t experience any downtime. But if you can&apos;t reach the site for a few hours, don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s *cough* working as intended.</div></div>
