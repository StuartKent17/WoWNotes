How large will the 6.1 Ashran teams be? 40v40?etc If too big, everyone going for one event will DESTROY fps due to server lag.
yup something we'll keep an eye on holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/568246654081454081

Wargame Battlegrounds currently can only be entered with EXP-ON. Can we address this bug?
we'll investigate it. We have to ensure that nothing in wargames grants you XP. Need to be thorough. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/568548974149238784
And to clarify, wargame arenas with XP-off is fine. It's just the wargame bgs that bug.
thanks for the information holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/568551718041964544
