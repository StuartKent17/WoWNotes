It&apos;s time to end the fun party we&apos;ve been having for the past 24H. As it turns out, it&apos;s pretty easy to add whatever the hell you want on a .gov website. According to this new page, Blizzard just trademarked Corgis Unleashed (http://teas.uspto.gov/forms/xslt.service?xsl=input&amp;stamp=USPTO/FTK-64.71.21.238-20130814120043649151-eTEAS-5002254c2c79d6aec8bf777b67318fc458a605d98a3ad9671ba654fed544b2367f), a game that according to our sources would kind of look like this (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGwQqxDWE2M).<br>
<br>
Edit: Apparently the original news was too subtle, the &quot;Corgis Unleashed&quot; trademark was registered this morning for fun, as it turns out, there is absolutely no check and anyone can register something under Blizzard&apos;s name. This is an application, not a confirmation, you don&apos;t even need to pay the $275 application fee. <br>

We probably jumped on the bandwagon a little early and I spent the past 24H double checking stuff since it was basically everywhere, I guess today is just not the day. Sorry guys, going to call the whole The Dark Below thing a hoax.</div></div>
