Ability Squish
We do feel that, at least for some classes, there are a few too many buttons to keep on your action bars. It's an issue we'd ultimately like to solve, but something we have to be very, very careful with.

It's easy to look at your bar, go "LOOKIT ALL DEM BUTTONS", and decide that some of them need to go. In fact, we agree. It's much more difficult -- even dangerous -- to decide exactly which abilities to get rid of. Generally speaking, if you have an ability keybound, it's probably at least fairly important to your class. Getting rid of abilities you don't have bound doesn't really fix anything, so that means that, in most cases, we're talking about cutting the important ones.

That's not to say it can't or won't be done, but it does mean it's a fairly large task. Depending on the ability, there could be a lot of rebalancing or restructuring needed to make sure the class is still functional and fun to play. Again, it's something we'd like to do, it's just a very involved process.

Something you didn't really touch on is how some abilities exist as flavour for the class. The last time this kind of ability trimming occurred, a lot of things we players took for fun and playing about wound up biting the bullet because they were seen as "unnecessary" i.e. Hunter's Eyes of the Beast. 
True, and we want to avoid that. As I mentioned above, removing abilities you don't often use doesn't accomplish much. We often talk about this issue in terms of action bar space, but it's really keybind space that's the problem. One could make an argument that, say, Unending Breath could stand to be cut, but that's not something that's going to free up a keybind for the vast majority of Warlocks.

Patch 5.4.2 Warrior Changes
We don't feel that Warrior damage output itself is the issue. It's strong, but not out of line compared to other classes. We think the issue lies with mobility, and the Warrior's ability to keep that constant pressure going. That's why we decided to revert the 5.4 Intervene change in 5.4.2 and move the root break back to Safeguard. Once we've had a chance to see how that affects things, we'll be able to decide if any further changes are necessary. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Reputation / Questing
Why not take the leap into mounted combat using the tech from quests like The Drakkensryd from back in Wrath?
It would take months of work to feel decent and not hacked in like it was in the overall awesome Drakkenryd quest. Source 

Dailies are a grind because being able to use your class is not really a challenge anymore to ANYONE.
I agree that's a problem when you start to overgear the content. Say Isle of Thunder at its launch still had challenging mobs. Source 

With the success of the Warlock Green Fire quest chain, are you planning to add quest chains for other classes?
If and when it makes sense. We like the feature overall but don't want it to become formulaic. Source 

Technically questing is trivial. It's not hard and everyone can do it. It's simply a time sink until raiding.
We could make WoW a game only about raiding. I don't think it would be as popular though. Source 
You know, the "heart and soul" thingie which is played by 5% of your players.
I don't know where that number comes from. Raiding is very popular. But that doesn't mean all players raid. Source 

Not the same as saying "okay but make it trivial for alts". Just reduce the restrictions since we've already done it all once.
Why? Why is being able to click quest objects without fighting anything a better design than just skipping questing altogether? Source 

Yet at max lvl, we won't be questing no dailies at max lvl, so no real change from current flying design decision
You will be out in the world doing stuff, more like Timeless Isle than Golden Lotus. Source 
But pls give to that T. Isle 2.0. some structure. Killing 2k Yaungols without the pacing/reward that a daily gave is boring.
Yeah, it won't just be Timeless Isle 2.0. That's just an example of content that isn't just "Kill 10 mogu every day." Source 

in WOD will we see more shared mob tagging outside of groups. Really like that in other games. Allow more impromptu grouping
We'd like to improve our tagging rules for sure. Not convinced dot everything to get credit on all is the right design. Source
