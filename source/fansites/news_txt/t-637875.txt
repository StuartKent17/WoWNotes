Ring of Valor Disabled until 3.1
Due to some recent issues we have disabled the Orgrimmar Arena, Ring of Valor, from both the Tournament and Live realms. We are working on resolving these issues and we plan to bring this arena back in the upcoming patch 3.1.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Dev Teams - Lead Designers
I am the lead systems designer. We have three lead designers. The other two are in charge of world design and content design. We all work together pretty closely.

The class and item designers are part of my team. However, our decision-making process is very, very collaborative and consensus-driven. We don't make any major changes unless the whole team is on board. Our decisions are also informed by input and collaboration with other designers and the rest of the WoW team. My job is not to force anyone to make certain decisions. I just try and keep us organized and on schedule and help maintain the overall vision for the game. Blizzard just doesn't operate with a great deal of hierarchy. We're a team and our folks are empowered to make decisions. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443413287-whos-in-charge.html

Tanking enchantments
We originally had two tanking enchants: the parry and stamina one. We pulled the stamina one and let's not revisit that whole discussion please but that means druids did get the shaft. The plan is to get a second tanking enchant in 3.1 but I am very hesistant to promise anything.

I don't know the Ulduar loot well enough it's not all complete last I looked so I don't know what the idols look like. I'm a little reluctant to spoil that loot too much in any case, though I know it's easy to find for those of you who don't mind the spoilers. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/15443451698-i-need-a-hug.html

PvP - Getting rid of the RNG
We agree with this for the most part. We don't want to remove random numbers in PvP even though I understand many players would, given the choice. An ability that hits 1% of the time for 20,000 damage on paper is perfectly balanced with an ability that hits 10% of the time for 2000 damage. However in PvP especially the first ability would be really frustrating for both the attacker and the victim. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443312070-rng-killed-my-dog.html

Tanking in Ulduar
We have absolute targets for things in the game, not just relative targets. We don't nerf someone because they are better than other classes. We nerf them because they are too good. This is more true for PvE than PvP; in PvP there is almost nothing to measure but relativity.

Our encounters, especially in Ulduar, are supposed to be of a certain difficulty level. If we buffed all tanks then those encounters are too easy. We would then have to increase how hard all of those bosses hit, which probably also means changing dps and healing capabilities on the encounter. It probably also means changing gear, since for example one of the things we wanted to hit was how high DK avoidance could get already.

I think many of these discussions come down to "It sucks to get nerfed." Believe me, we know. Nerfing classes means there was a failure on our part. You should blame us, and certainly not other players who make decent posts or participate in PTR testing. 

All tanking classes have cooldowns they can blow when big hits from the boss are coming. However, to be clear those hits are also supposed to be scary. It's a good time for healers or whoever to blow their cooldowns too to help the tank survive.

We still want the DKs to have a lot of cooldowns, and they still do. The problem was those cooldowns just made them too effective at tanking many of the big encounters in the game. We need to see what things look like with the changes we put in place and re-evaluate then.

Shield block is a lot more useful on bosses that hit quickly for smaller individual hits -- something like Prince in Karazhan. It just so happens that Saph, Malygos, Sarth and KT don't use that kind of mechanic. In an ideal world I suppose there could always be four equal bosses at the end of a tier, each one showcasing the tanking abilities of one of the classes. That really constrains our encounter design though, as well as suggesting to the community that what you are supposed to do is have all 4 tank classes available and swap in a specific one for each fight. No doubt some guilds who want world firsts will do that, but our design is that you need 2 to 3 tanks for an encounter and you have 4 classes from which to choose them.

We thought that DKs and druids made the Sartharion encounter too easy, and looking forward we saw encounters in Ulduar where we thought the same thing would happen. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/15443312626-blizzard-missed-the-boat-and-the-ocean.html

Healing in Ulduar
We don't generally throw out raid damage so severe that you have to heal multiple targets within one GCD or risk losing them all. If you are finding that to be the case then it's possible your group is not sufficiently geared for the encounter. If players are dying a lot during Vortex, their health may just be too low. After the Vortex had ended, you should have plenty of time to heal someone, target someone else to heal them, etc.

We still intend for you to be able to take any 3 healers it will probably be closer to 3 for Ulduar in a 10 player group and be good to go. However, as you start to try hard modes there is going to be more pressure to have every player in the role that most emphasizes their strengths. You may want a mix of healers more than ever on those encounters. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/15443533231-pally-healing-flavor-broken.html

Howling Blast longer cooldown in 3.1
If it was completely a replacement for Obliterate, then there would be no point in having Obliterate for Frost DKs and Unholy DKs already don't use it. A cooldown lets HB be a better button than Obliterate some of the time, but the rest of the time you'll still use Obliterate.

Change to abilities cooldown in 3.1
If DKs take too much damage now, we can fix that. If increasing cooldowns means they aren't fun any longer, then we can try and fix that too. But I hope you understand that we don't want to have an unbalanced class in any aspect of the game just because that makes it fun for that class.

[...] Making DK cooldowns fun and meaningful is absolutely a priority. But having 4 viable tanking classes is also a priority. One of those things cannot just completely trump the other. We also have a slight concern that DK tanking was fun for some players not because of the mechanics but because it was overpowered.

Players who are making suggestions about how to keep DK tanking mechanics fun without being overpowered are making useful comments. Players who are just posting "the class is now gutted; I'm gonna reroll" are making the kind of comments I just skip over and the mods tend to delete.

Unholy in 3.1
We don't want all DKs to be Unholy. Some of the initial predictions of Unholy dominance in 3.1 were made based on incorrect assumptions about how the new scaling worked. We have since toned down some of the huge hits done by Scourge Strike and Plague Strike and there will be more changes as we go along.

Shadow of Death removal
It was an unusual talent that kept causing problems. Every time we needed to change the way it worked usually required new code. It just got the point where we were spending too much time to fix one talent that was novel, but not really game changing. The class designers got together and voted just to put it out of its misery.

Nourish
We're not trying to push druids into being Nourishbots. Druid hots continue to be very good. The only thing that has changed is we wanted to make it a little harder to sustain mana indefinitely while throwing out lots of hots.

Nourish is there because sometimes hots don't cut it. Sometimes you are healing a 5-man or healing a tank or another situation where the healing per second of the hots may not be sufficient.

So far on the PTR we have seen druids using Nourish when only the tank is taking damage, but we've seen them using all of their spells on normal raid encounters, and last I looked, the healing from Nourish was down below Rejuv, WG and LB. We'll continue to monitor the numbers coming in though. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/15443452768-devs-its-not-too-late-to-reconsider-nourish.html

Judgement of Justice vs. Druids
We are concerned about JoJ vs. druids. We have a change coming up or maybe it's out already that will improve the situation from the druid POV, but it isn't shifting breaking JoJ. 

Are you talking about no 40 yard JoJs from holy paladins, or something else? The enlightened judgements nerf isnt on the PTR I don't think... but it is in your updated patchnotes.
Yes, that's it. We originally extended the range for Holy paladins so they could hang back to heal and still judge, but a 40 yard range JoJ is pretty brutal to druids. We think its is going to be a lot less of an issue when the paladin has to run up to snare you. This in turn should let druids run away and drink or heal. We don't think this change alone will provide the big buff Resto druids may be looking for. But we also think it will definitely be felt. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443193034-you-can-trinket-joj.html

Faerie Fire duration increased to 5 minutes in 3.1
5 min PvE. 40 sec in PvP. I know these variable durations are getting pretty common. We just discussed trying to modify the tooltips so that they display both durations. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443291662-faerie-fire-5-mins-duration--not-pvp-right.html

Lifebloom Nerf
1 A few players have suggested decreasing the duration of LB instead. This isn't something we are likely to do. Having LBs of 10 sec allows druids to spend GCDs on something other than just LB. It's not that we want you to only ever cast LB. We just want it to be mana intensive to do a lot of LBs while doing everything else. We were worried clever Resto druids would stretch out their mana by just focusing on LB rolling on multiple targets. On mana intensive fights, this would be the only way to play as Resto and possibly make the harder encounters easier than we intended. You should be able to heal without running OOM. If you get to a point where you have to heal a lot i.e. there is A LOT of damage hitting the tank or the raid then running OOM should be a risk. Make sense? In any case, we think the longer LBs is a good quality of life improvement and not something we are likely to tinker with at this point.

2 If you look at the parses for groups beating on the Patchwerk test boss in Ulduar then Nourish is a great deal of Resto healing. However, if you look at the parses of the actual boss encounters, you see things like Rejuv, then WG, then LB then Nourish. On fights with less area damage that will obviously be different. Furthermore, we still have some tuning to do and guilds still have some experimentation to do. In other words, I would not read too much into the numbers. But there are some numbers.

Changes to hunter mechanics in 3.0.x and 3.1
What is interesting about these "my class is such a roller coaster" responses is they tend to only happen with classes that are powerful. With classes or specs that are considered underpowered, the community tends to beg for any kind of change at all and will happily relearn all their buttons just because they really want to play that character.

I'm not trying to dismiss the OP's sentiment, because it's a totally valid way to feel IMO. I'm just pointing out that it sometimes gets used as justification for why we shouldn't nerf a class.

"You're making me relearn my class."
"It's not fun for me to play my class anymore."
"This change went against the design you said you had for us."
"This change goes against the class descriptions on the website."

Those are all valid points, but obviously we felt the change was necessary despite all of those points and they are rarely going to convince us to undo the changes. Though we might try to address those concerns in other ways.

I'll also throw out that the community tends to assume that 99% of the changes we make are for balance reasons. There are a lot of those, but we also make changes just because we don't like the way mechanics are working out.

Lack of talent points for pets
That's fair feedback. On the other hand, one of the problems we had with 51 BM before was that hunters could scoop up all of the "useful" talents without their extra 4 points.

Paladins in WotLK
We are pretty happy with the paladin overhaul from Lich King. It is taking some time to polish all the changes both from a balance and gameplay perspective. We're not convinced every class in the game needs those kind of major changes. It is pretty typical to see players demanding overhauls or "rebuild the class from scratch" kind of posts, but we just disagree in most cases.

That is not to say that every class couldn't use some polish somewhere. We really don't think of "x class is finished" as a realistic goal. Like a kid with a rebuilt car, we're always going to be tweaking the engine to some extent. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443253061-other-class-changes-like-paldins.html

Sacred Shield
Sacred Shield was possibly only a problem in PvP on the larger teams or for rage generation, but we fixed that separately. It was really a PvE problem because the damage prevention was really starting to add up in Ulduar. We know this was supposed to be one of the answers for how paladins can "group heal." However, you shouldn't need to do a ton of group healing in raids, and in PvP or heroic dungeons, you should still have enough tools to manage: fast heals, the HL glyph, Beacon, etc.

The topic of whether Holy paladin healing is too simplistic is a good conversation to have, though probably beyond the scope of this thread. Some players like a play style where they don't have many different spells to weave together so we try to offer ways to play like that. What I mean is that there are players who like the Holy healing style as it is. We think we can improve it, as we think we can improve most aspects of the game, but we want to be careful to do so without ruining what it is they enjoy or what makes the class distinct.

Frostbrand in 3.1
Our intent is still WF/FT in PvE. You can opt to use FB in PvP, especially with these changes. Shamans benefit a lot from being fully raid buffed since both melee and spellpower buffs and debuffs can help them. In PvP where you likely won't have so many buffs, you might not miss the damage as much and could use FB for its extra benefits.

Unstable Affliction remains multi-target
The "good reason" in this case was we were actually debating making UA single target. I wasn't prepared to say anything until we were farther along with the debate and I could offer some decent reasons pro and con. If we decided not to make the change which is what happened in this case we didn't think it was worth freaking everyone out. Sometimes we talk about potential changes and sometimes we don't.

To be clear: We have decided to leave UA castable on multiple targets. The rank with a single target limit is a bug. It might be fixed in the current PTR build. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443308764-31-ptr-ua-single-target-only.html

Removing stances from the game
Like I said in another thread, we'll see how the modified stance penalties work out. From a high-level design view, we would love to get rid of them. From a more nuts and bolts standpoint, it might take reworking the numbers on a lot of abilities to get it there. We're just going to have to see how it goes.

Shattering Throw in PvE
To answer a question that has been posed several times, you can use Shattering Throw in PvE. The armor reduction will work on bosses. We erred on the side of making the cooldown and cast time conservative. If nothing explodes with the introduction of the new ability, we'll consider changing the numbers in the future or add appropriate glyphs or talents to do so. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443531660-thoughts-on-ptr-warrior-changes-constructive.html

Is the armor pen from shattering throw going to stack with sunders etc.? If not, just make it apply 5 sunders. It's an insignificant buff PvE wise.
It stacks with sunder. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443531660-thoughts-on-ptr-warrior-changes-constructive.html

Shattering Throw in PvP
I know some of you just pull the other stances off of your bar in PvP figuratively anyway, but some warriors do shift to Battle Stance when dealing with highly armored opponents, and you might be even more likely to do so with the armor pen and introduction of Shattering Throw. It will either break the immunity or remove the armor, not both. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443531660-thoughts-on-ptr-warrior-changes-constructive.html

Heroic Throw
Heroic Throw is an important tool for tanks who are pulling. We couldn't pull it out of Defensive Stance, yet part of what we wanted to do with Shattering Throw was give you another situational reason to shift to Battle Stance. We also want to give ourselves plenty of room to adjust the cooldown and cast time of Shattering Throw, which again mucks up Heroic Throw's role as a pulling tool.

We would still like to add some additional functionality to Heroic Throw for dps warriors. The problem is all of the obvious choices, say a Disarm or Interrupt, are either useless or overpowered. We don't really think we need more caster hate in the game right now. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443191897-why-shattering-throw-why-these-changes.html

Stance and penalties
No other class has stances. We don't want warrior stances to be like DK presences for example. DKs aren't generally supposed to change their presence much. We want warriors to change stances within reason. You don't need to point out that tanks stay in Defensive Stance nearly all of the time.

Part of the design of Berserker Stance is that it's a reckless stance. You do more damage and have access to some important abilities, but you also open yourself up to additional damage as well. We could, for example, change the crit bonus on Zerk to 10%, but we would offset that by lowering warrior damage -- we aren't just going to give warriors free damage unless we feel their damage is low, and for Fury warriors, we don't feel that way. And let's please not turn this into another TG thread.

Now as you can tell with the latest patch, we are trying to see if we can get rid of the stance penalties. But that does not mean getting rid of the stances, and that does not mean that shifting stance just becomes an extra button click you macro in to use the ability you want. For example, if you are considering going to Defensive because everyone is ganging up on you, that should be a decision not an instant reflex.

Similarly, rather than throwing up our hands and just letting warriors stay in Zerk all of the time for PvP, we are trying to create situations where going to Battle makes logical sense... but again, with a trade-off. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443532988-comparing-warrior-stances-to-other-classes.html

[...] Not that this is the tank forum, but it's a buff to Defensive Stance. Instead of doing 10% less damage you do 5% less damage.

This is an experiment. We do have some concern that for example warriors might just slip into Defensive Stance in PvP if they could do exactly the same damage minus a few key abilities. But it the sun continues to rise in the morning after these changes have been tested for a little while, we might eventually pull the penalties completely. This would be true for Berserker Stance as well. 

[...] Yeah, I was refering to turtling. We're fine with Defensive Stance being used to turtle in PvP. Perfect. But we want you to have to actually turtle when you do it, which means doing less damage. DKs for example give up say 15% damage to shift to Frost Presence. It is hard to equate that directly to the loss of certain abilities for the warrior.

I'm not saying you don't need Intercept, WW etc. in PvP. I'm saying that you're obviously willing to do without them for short periods of time when you are fighting defensively. Letting Defensive Stance do too much damage may tip that scale. We'll see. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443451663-thanks-for-the-warrior-survivability-nerf.html
