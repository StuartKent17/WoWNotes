<br>
Battlemasters and collision<br>
If you&apos;re playing on a high population server it probably already happened to you, you can&apos;t click the battlemaster to join a BG because this stupid tauren decided to stay on it. Well, it&apos;s fixed in 2.4 !<br>
In 2.4, the Battlemasters are standing on platforms with collision around them.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re also working on a better solution for Wrath of the Lich King.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guild bank items price<br>
A cool feature could be added to the guild bank : letting the guild master set prices for specific items to let members buy them from the guild bank.<br>
We&apos;ve been exploring ideas about letting guild masters set prices for items from the guild bank. We hope to get some cool guild bank improvements in over time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Titles in Wrath of the Lich King<br>
Tigole explains how titles will be used in the expansion.<br>
We want titles to be meaningful in WoW and not commonplace. Our goal is to release more titles sparingly, so that the titles carry weight with other players. We do have a lot of plans for some new systems incoporating titles in Wrath of the Lich King. More information will be coming out on that soon.<br>
<br>
Also, we feel like we have to be careful about rewarding people for behavior that might not be the best game experience. As much as everyone loves killing Murlocs, I feel like I have a moral and social responsibility not to encourage you to grind out 10,000 Murloc kills.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lake Wintergrasp and server-wide buff<br>
Controlling the Lake Wintergrasp (the new outdoor PvP zone introduced in WotLK) might give a buff to your whole faction regardless of their location.<br>
Q: Why can&apos;t you make it so that cities like Halaa (well, pick another one, not Halaa) give a server wide buff to players, if it is controlled by your faction?<br>
A: That&apos;s a cool idea. Maybe we&apos;ll do something like that with Lake Wintergrasp.<br>
<br>

<br>
Reminder: WotLK class feedback<br>
Vaneras posted a short message to confirm that Blizzard employees are still reading the official feedback threads created a few weeks ago to discuss class balancing in the expansion.<br>
I would just like to remind people that you can still post your feedback (be it positive or negative) in the &apos;Class Feedback Requested&apos; thread: Class Feedback Requested<br>
<br>
I know that thread has been there for a while now, and that you haven&apos;t heard much since we posted it, but we are still following it and reading the things you have to say in that thread. We also forward your feedback to the developers on a regular basis.<br>

German player reaches gold limit - 214,748 Gold<br>
I received TONS of mails about this and I guess it&apos;s worth a news. A german player reached the gold limit on live servers, and had to contact a gamemaster because he couldn&apos;t loot the gold in his mails anymore ... You can see the conversation with the gamemaster (in german) in this screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/goldlimit.jpg), basically the GM just says that there is no way to bypass the limit and he should just transfer money to his alts. ^^<br>
<br>
According to a few posts on various forums (including this one (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=3637.msg33282#msg33282), it&apos;s the maximum amount of gold because the developers decided to use a signed 32-bit integer for gold, the first bit being 0 means that the number is positive.<br>
<br>
As far as I know, that&apos;s the not the first case of a player reaching the gold limit on a live server, it already happened a few months ago when a player on US realms reached it - see this screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/691k3KN.jpg) from Blood Legion (http://bloodlegion.com/), the limit is definitely 214,748 gold)<br>
