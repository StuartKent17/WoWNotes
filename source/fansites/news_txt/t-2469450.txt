PvP Tuning Incoming - February 26
Today, we’re working on hotfixes that will focus on two areas of concern.

As we’ve monitored PvP matches since our PvP mana changes to healers and Restoration Druids, we’ve found that Lifebloom, as a source of healing, has become too-efficient. While the reduction to Focused Growth’s increased healing and mana cost savings is a sizeable change, Restoration Druids have a wide variety of well-performing PvP talent options to fit in its place.

Restoration
Focused Growth  now reduces the mana cost of Lifebloom by 8% was 20%.
Focused Growth  now increases the healing of Lifebloom by 8% per stack was 20%.


Additionally, we’ve identified an Azerite Trait that has been providing too much healing in an arena environment when multiple members of a team equip the trait.

Heart of Azeroth
Bonded Souls  healing reduced by 85% when engaged in combat with enemy players was 50%.


These changes are not live yet, but will be made live soon. I’ll update this post when the changes go live, and as always, you’ll see them noted in their final form in our next Hotfixes Update.
