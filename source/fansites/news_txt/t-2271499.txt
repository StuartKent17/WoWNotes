Legion PvP Season 4 Ending Soon!
Soon the gates will close on Legion PvP Season 4 for all Arena and Battleground competitors.

Season 4 – End of Season Rewards
If you participated in Season 4, to ensure you receive the rewards that you’re due, please keep the following in mind:


Refrain from transferring your characters to another realm or faction until after Legion Season 4 has ended.
Legion Season 4 titles and mounts will be awarded approximately two weeks after the season ends.


Faction-Based Rewards
Don’t forget—end-of-season rewards are based on your faction. If you transfer your character to the other faction, you must have 50 wins after your transfer to receive the reward. You must have 150 wins for Gladiator and Cruel Gladiator.

When the last sounds of clashing weapons fade, how will you measure up this season?

Could the Black Transmutagen alchemy reagent have a vendor sell price? We get far too many with almost no way to use up!
All transmutagens can be vendored in 7.3.Thanks! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/892090959852322825

What does Sargeras do in his pasttime?
Drives the lore community insane Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/892120270785265664

Is the Celestial Calf supposed to be cageable and resellable on 7.3 PTR? Sounds like a bug.
This change has been reverted. You can still collect three of them now in 7.3. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/892147633967452160

The Netherlight Crucible And You
I'm...even more confused...
TLDR:

Before the patch, if you get a relic that doesn't have the trait you want, you throw it away.

After the patch, if you get a relic that doesn't have the trait you want, you can plug it into the Netherlight Crucible and maybe get it anyway.

That's about all there is to it! Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1068882-the-netherlight-crucible-and-you/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20758616309?page=1#7
