2014 Blizzard Stream Awards, Powered by Twitch

 

In 2014, the Twitch streaming community grew and provided countless hours of entertainment to viewers, much of it based on Blizzard games. To recognize the efforts of your favorite streamers and channels, Blizzard is proud to announce the 2014 Blizzard Stream Awards powered by Twitch. These awards will provide recognition and cash prizes for the best Blizzard content streamers of 2014.

Award nominees will be announced on Tuesday, March 10, and award winners will be announced on Wednesday, March 18, right here on Blizzard’s official community sites and on Blog.Twitch.tv 

For a list of awards categories and to learn how the 2014 Blizzard Stream Awards powered by Twitch works, check out the breakdown below.

How It Works

Award Categories: Together, Blizzard and Twitch have established 21 unique award categories representing streamers from five Blizzard franchises Diablo III, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, StarCraft II, and World of Warcraft. Six of these categories are data-driven example: Most number of hours streamed for Blizzard titles in 2014 while the others are qualitative categories that will be voted on by you, the community of viewers.


Prizes: In this program, Twitch will distribute a prize pool of approximately $113,700 for 2014 Twitch partner streamers, with the first place winners in each category taking home $2014.


Implementation: Voting will occur for the polled categories through Noon PDT on Tuesday, March 17, 2015, via the polls linked below. After voting has closed, we will announce the winners of both the polled categories and the data-driven categories.


Rules: To qualify for the 2014 Blizzard Stream Awards presented by Twitch, you must be a Twitch partner streamer  who streamed game content from one of these five Blizzard franchises: Diablo III, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, StarCraft II, and World of Warcraft between January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014.

Vote: Favorite New WoW Streamer in 2014
Since when was BlondieWondie a new WoW Streamer? Pretty sure she has been streaming longer than lets say Taymoo has. Why is she even on this list if she's not a new WoW streamer?

BlondieWondie started streaming WoW in February of 2014. Taymoo  got started in May of 2014. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Vote: Favorite WoW PvE Streamer in 2014
this contest just shows up hor oblivious blizzard really is considering they have Dexter_bl AND Seriousgaming same person LOL. and of course allinity who just shows her cleavage but u know thats a great stream nowadays... how is spartysmallwood who does nothing but stream high progresion raiding while teaching the wow community at the same time NOT on this list?! Blizzard seriously hire some competant ppl aready!
All of the listed nominees reached above a certain threshold of popularity for all of 2014, as defined numerically by Twitch. In 2014, both the Dexter_bl channel and the Seriousgaming channel were among the X most-popular channels streaming World of Warcraft more than Y% of the time. As was Alinity.

I personally really like SpartySmallWood, and hope he climbs into the highest echelon of WoW streamers in 2015. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Trade Chat
There are a number of things in place that already make it difficult for gold spammers to be a nuisance for long, as well as tools for players to help us clean them up such as the report function. It's something we're always looking at, working on, and improving so that we can make the game environment better for people who just want to play like you. We also have to be careful not to impact regular players by restricting chat too harshly.

Thats right money, you enjoy their subs and game fees too much
That classic misconception has been thrown around a lot and I want to avoid repeating myself so I'll just link to what I previously said. 

We do know about the disconnection issue and it's being worked on. We're just as keen to resolve it as you all are, I assure you. In the meantime, as some people here have suggested, addons can help with limiting what you seen in chat channels. But I will once again highlight that we're always working to improve things, and we thank you for leaving feedback about it. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
