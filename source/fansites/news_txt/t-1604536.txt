There will always be a 'best'. it can be close though.
This. If the difference between 2H and DW is a dozen stat points, that's fine. Celestalon 

what's the deal with glyphs? Mages have 24 while others have 30+ / 40+! That's sad to know. =/ #warcraft
Mage: 21M/9m, Hunt: 25/11, Rog: 24/13, a lot of mage glyphs were baked into class recently though, suggests? Muffinus

regarding Warlocks: Sims are showing Shadowburn as a DPS loss due to the removal of the mana return. Does this concern you?
Of course, but that doesn't match what we're seeing. Celestalon 

PvE
Will Herald of the Titans be removed in 6.0?
Nope, should still be available and in the same general tuning ballpark. WatcherDev 

PvP
some confusion about if there can be multiple Ashran instances available to a single server 
Each realm only points to one Ashran but multiple realms may point to the same Ashran. holinka 
will the 100 per faction cap potentially be raised if servers like Illidan/Sargeras end up with long Ashran queue times?
We'll raise it as high as the game can handle holinka 

Will there be a base honor prize per win or just all strong box? currently on beta I've won 20+ skirms and earned 349 honor 
There will be small honor prize per win. But you can expect skirmishes to be fairly inefficient at first. holinka 

Is there an honor wipe at launch?
Yes holinka 

Will the 2.2k enchants Bloody Dancing Steel, Spirit of Conquest... etc. still be available for purchase in WoD?
The visual will be a part of the Enchanter's Study in the Garrisons. It will still have a rating requirement. I believe it's 2400 holinka 

Lore
Horde do get off easy. Wage war and suffer no lasting damage. weird dichotomy compared how it played out Ally
Disagree. Lots of Horde casualties; Darkspear rebels, Org civilians, vendors and trainers on spikes in SoO. _DonAdams 

But again, the Horde only started losing because Garrosh turned on itself, not because of Alliance action.
How so? Alliance players raid Orgrimmar just the same. Fictionally, any raid who defeats SoO is responsible. _DonAdams 

I think it's more monotony: Horde acts, Alliance reacts, Horde implodes due to plot device, Alliance wins by passivity
Operation Shieldwall not passive. Anduin chasing the Divine Bell not passive. SoO not passive. _DonAdams 
Wrathion himself concludes as much at the end.
I don't think musing over Garrosh unraveling the Horde is meant to diminish the Alliance's impact on fighting him _DonAdams 

Garrisons
I believe it is, just the Bunker will not increase the chance of upgraded follower chance from quests rewards.
They still have the chance to be upgraded, it's just not increased by the building. Muffinus 

Kinda wish this wasn't the case so it didn't force those buildings on us. Choice with Garrisons seems nonexistent.
At a point, you will have made all of the things you want, and you can't sell the soulbound reagents, so swap! Muffinus
