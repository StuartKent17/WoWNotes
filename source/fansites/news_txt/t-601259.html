According to this post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=101221667&amp;sid=1), a new patch will be applied on the PTRs tonight, this is possibly the one that will boost the stats of 90% of the current epic items (including armor sets), so ... stay tuned.<br>

<br>
Cauldrons informations<br>
Cauldrons will be added in the 2.1.0 as new alchemy recipes, they&apos;re a bit like Soul wells created by warlocks but instead of giving you health stones, they will give you major resistance potions. I&apos;d also like to point out the fact that the new resistance potions have a 2 minutes effect instead of the 1 hour timer on the old ones. <br>
And before you ask, nop, no Holy cauldrons. ^^<br>
