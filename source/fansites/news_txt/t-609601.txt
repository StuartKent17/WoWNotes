Update Talent Calculator : For people who REALLY want to play with talents, our internal Talent Calculator  is now available. Keep in mind that it's not really supposed to be public and there are probably a bunch of bugs here, but it should be working for most of you. Note to IE6 users : Get Firefox 

It seems that some of the fansites part of the official fansite program were allowed  to posts all the info from the skills and talents of the Death Knight gathered during the Worldwide Invitational. I guess that's the time to officially start the WotLK preview here and we'll start with the skills and talents of all the classes except for the Hunter and Paladins not available yet 

More to come depending on ... how it goes. We all know what it means

Disclaimer
This is ALPHA stuff, it can and most likely will be changed and a lot of things will be modified before Wrath of the Lich King is released. This is only a preview of the final game but doesn't reflect the balance between classes at the release. Also note that any post with screenshots of the alpha will be moderated, the old "no WotLK stuff" rule still applies.
