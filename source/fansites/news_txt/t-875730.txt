Guild challenges are now available on test realms, so far it only looks like weekly quests pushing your guild experience cap further. However it looks like the game also supports gold rewards for challenges, maybe after you reach the cap See the Build 13793 Strings below. we will probably know more about it when Blizzard posts the official preview.
