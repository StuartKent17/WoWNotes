Destiny 2 is coming to Battle.Net! This announcement is especially interesting after the announcement about transitioning away from the Battle.net name (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/768810-battlenet-update/).<br>
We want to let everyone know that a new game will be appearing alongside your favorite Blizzard games&#x2014;one that&#x2019;s a little different from what you might normally expect. Bungie&#x2019;s upcoming first-person action game Destiny 2 will be joining the party! We&#x2019;re excited to announce that we&apos;re partnering with Bungie and Activision to support the PC version of Destiny 2 exclusively via Battle.net.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re big fans of Destiny here at Blizzard, and we&#x2019;re honored to be able to help the talented folks at Bungie and Activision bring their much-anticipated sequel to a new platform. Being on Battle.net will allow Destiny 2 to plug in to our existing global network, freeing up the developers at Bungie to focus their energy and resources on making the best and most fun game they possibly can. This also means Destiny 2 players will have access to our online social functionality, including chat with friends, the ability to see which of their friends are online in Destiny 2 or in Blizzard games, and the ability to stream gameplay directly to Facebook.<br>
<br>
See the FAQ below for further platform details, and stay tuned for updates as we get closer to welcoming Destiny 2 and its players to Battle.net. To learn more about Destiny 2, head over to www.destinythegame.com (http://www.destinythegame.com/).<br>

Why are you adding a non-Blizzard game to Blizzard&apos;s platform?<br>
We loved Destiny and think Destiny 2 is going to be a great game. Blizzard has an established and successful global internet infrastructure we&#x2019;ve used for years to support our own games. Creating a new network client for Destiny 2, which is bringing the franchise to PC for the first time, would needlessly extend the development period for the game. We want to get our hands on Destiny 2 as soon as possible like everybody else, so we offered to share our PC platform with our sister companies for this release.<br>
<br>
Does this mean other games are going to come to the Blizzard platform too?<br>
Our focus in terms of supporting non-Blizzard games is solely around Destiny 2. Aside from potentially evaluating needs or opportunities for future Activision games, we don&#x2019;t have any short- or long-term plans to support third-party games with Battle.net. It&#x2019;s important to us to maintain our quality standards for any experience or service we&#x2019;re putting in front of our players, which represents a big investment of time and effort on our part, so this is not something we&#x2019;re jumping into lightly.<br>
<br>
Does this mean I&apos;ll be able to use my Blizzard Balance to purchase Destiny 2?<br>
Yes!<br>
<br>
Will Destiny 2 offer the same cross-game social features that Blizzard titles currently have?<br>
Destiny 2 will be integrated into many of Blizzard&#x2019;s existing social features&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll be able to chat with friends playing Destiny 2 the same way you already can for Blizzard games. Players will also be able to add friends and form parties the same way Blizzard gamers can. And, you&#x2019;ll see a Destiny 2 status icon by your friends who are playing Destiny 2 the same way you do for friends playing StarCraft II, Diablo III, WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone, and Overwatch.<br>
<br>
Where and when will Destiny 2 on PC be available?<br>
We&#x2019;re excited to work with Bungie to bring the PC version of Destiny 2 to every region Blizzard currently operates in. Bungie is actively working through the global details. We look forward to sharing additional information later this year.<br>
<br>
Who will be operating Destiny 2&#x2019;s servers?<br>
Bungie will maintain Destiny 2&#x2019;s servers; Blizzard&#x2019;s servers will be used for features related to the Blizzard platform, such as login and social functionality.<br>
<br>
And what about customer service?<br>
Destiny 2&#x2019;s gameplay customer service will be handled by Bungie; Blizzard will handle customer service for platform and shop issues specific to our service.</div></div>
