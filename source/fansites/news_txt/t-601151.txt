Blizzard posters made tons of new posts today, let's resume everything and also add the things I missed in the last days sorted from the most interesting to "who cares about this ?" :


We still don't have an exact estimate on when this patch will be ready but development is wrapping up and the test phase should begin relatively soon. As a reminder, the patch undergoes internal testing before public, PTR testing. 



In regards to the Romulo and Julianne Opera Event, Tigole said the following: 

We're looking at this encounter for possible changes in 2.1.0. No exact details yet. The goal is to bring the difficulty in line with the other two opera house events. 



The following changes to cleave have been made for the 2.1.0 patch. 
Cleaves will only hit people in front of the creature. 
Cleaves will have a chain length equal to the combat reach of the creature. 



Corrected an issue where Coilfang Ambushers would evade unnecessarily.



We are aware that Hunters and Warlocks still have problems with their pets, when taking off on their flying mounts The pet is still running and aggros all mobs, or it lands off with its master and then disappears. We recently said that this problem would be solved for Hunter and Warlock pets and in regards to that, we would like to inform you that we expect to have that issue resolved in the patch 2.1. 

When the Hunter or Warlock is mounting a flying mount, the pet will automatically be “saved” and then un-summon, and dismounting the flying mount will cause the pets to re-summon immediately This will also happen when using a flight path.
