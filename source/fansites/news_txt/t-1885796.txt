Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Is there such thing as overwhelming content opposed to lots of choices? Is it design flaw for dailies to turn in to chores?
So many developers turn to replaying a thing to get more life out of it. OccupyGStreet 
So i have been just wondering why game houses are so slow to expand and increase output and what could be done to increase it
Hiring is very slow, especially if you care about your studio's culture. OccupyGStreet 
For example there is a global shortage of effects artists right now. We just can't hire as many as we need. OccupyGStreet 
I'll throw out this Q to everyone: What games have you played for a long time that didn't recycle or reuse levels, dungeons, etc.? OccupyGStreet 
In other words, is it even possible for a studio to produce content faster than players can consume it? OccupyGStreet 
Procedural content say Age of Empires random maps or Diablo random dungeons may be one approach. Are there others? OccupyGStreet 


Computers - Setup of the Month
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices  are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. 

New CPUs from Intel and GPUs from AMD are here, but they aren't huge improvements over the previous generation. 

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 6700K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions!
