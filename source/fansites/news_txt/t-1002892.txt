Boubouille2011-10-21, 07:31 PMWhat is Mists of Pandaria?

The goal is to combine new gameplay with most fun parts of the past. 
The plan is to get people back into the world, instead of having players roam around Stormwind and Orgrimmar all the time once they reach max level. 
Developers want you to do what you want to do to progress your character. They really want you to feel like you have a menu of content where you can pick whatever you want to do, and you shouldn't feel forced to do something to progress your character. For example, daily quests will reward you with valor points but it will still be faster if you raid of course. 
Character builds are going to be entirely revamped. Talents were still too cookie cutter, so the developers want to give players more choices in their talents.


Pandaria

5 New leveling zones to explore
Single, unified continent
Influenced by Asian landscapes
AH, Bank, and Central Questing Hub
No flying until max level
There's 5 leveling zones but they are very large zones, and you won't have your flying mount.

Lore of Pandaria

A long, storied history.

Verming are ... new kobolds, they kinda look like evil bunnies. 
Mantid: Whole raids and dungeons around this race. Insect race that has been there since the beginning of ages. They have been seperated by a giant wall. They are starting to go crazy and are going through the wall

Cataclysm Talents

Pro - The level 10 specs were really nice and gave you a role early in the game, definitely a keeper.
Pro - Removing junk from the talent trees was also a very good move.
Pro - Having some kind of choices for optional skills/subspecs worked out pretty well.
Con - You had a risk of "skipping" important talents
Con - There wasn't enough junk removed
Con - There wasn't enough choices, you might have a different final talent point than another combat rogue but it just wasn't enough. The cookie cutter build still persists.
Con - No enough customization, no true hybridization Using a little bit of 2 different trees
Con - Players got grumpy


Talent System 2.0

The talent system is gone! Ok, not really, but it's greatly changed.
You now have your class abilities, your spec abilities, and your talents.
You still choose your spec at level 10, and you get a spec ability at level 10. You will get additional spec abilities later. There are anything that you really need to function, they will just be given to you to make sure you have all the tools you need to have. 


Example - Prot Paladin

LVL 10 - Avenger's Shield
LVL 20 - Hammer of the Righteous Prot and Ret
LVL 30 - Judgement of the Just Passive

Talents

There is not talent points or ranks.
There is one talent pree per class.
You earn talents every 15 levels.
You get to choose 1 out of 3 every time you get a new point, you can only pick one of them and can't go back to get the other ones.
There will be no mandatory talent. There won't be any cookie cutter build or anything, it will depend on what kind of optional ability you want.
You can now change talents as easily as you change glyphs. 
More info in the Talent Tree Panel at 2:15

PvE Scenarios

PvE Scenarios are a way to give new interesting content that doesn't make sense in a dungeon content. 
Scenarios are more about reusing parts of the world in interesting new ways, and introducing new types of PvE gameplay that we've never seen before like PvE battlegrounds.
They are short instances for a few players, the amount of players can vary depending on the scenario, some of them can be for 3 players.
You don't need the typical tank/heal/dps setup, you will just be able to enter and play your role no matter what it is.
It will be a staged experience where you will try to accomplish some greater goal
For example, a scenario might require you to kill 25 kobolds in stage 1, then find and return 4 goldshire children, and then kill the boss. 
Developers would like to do PvE battlegrounds, where you will have to slay 50 alliance/horde soldiers, destroy 6 towers and the barracks, and then defeat the enemy General. 
They could replace group quests.
It uses the same queue system as the dungeon finder
Since there is no role requirements, queues should be instant.

Raids
3 new Epic raids!

They will feature two enemy races, the Mogu and the Mantid.
Raid Finder, Normal, and Heroic difficulties will be available for all raids from day 1. 
World raid bosses will return!
More info will be available at the Raids & Dungeons Panel today.


Questing

Increased focus on max level content, it will reward you with Valor Points. 
Incentives for dungeons/raiders to run quests and do outdoor/daily kind of stuff. For example finishing a quest might give you a buff for the day, and maybe that buff will let you roll on a loot that only appears to people with that buff.
More quest choices, and a lot less linear
No flying until max level, it's much easier to keep people on the ground and create interesting quests when you know people won't just fly away and drop on the boss.
Faction improvements, there will be group of factions and they will let you work for all factions from that group to get your rewards. This way you don't have to grind a single faction anymore.

Major Class Changes
Resilience

Devs like the way Resilience works in PvP, and how it gives a nice goal for players looking to progress/upgrade their gear in PvP
Resilience is a pretty huge barrier for people who want to start PvPing.
Resilience will become a base stat, and will increase a little every time you level. 


Ranged Weapons

Hunter minimum range is gone!
Hunter melee weapon is gone!
Ranged slot for all other characters are gone.
Relics are gone.
Rogues and warriors can now throw their melee weapon
Wands become main hand weapons



http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/thumb/pp114.jpg http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/pp114.jpghttp://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/thumb/pp115.jpg http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/pp115.jpg

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock

Unique resource for each spec. 
Affliction will keep Soul Shards, they are currently not interesting enough but devs have cool ideas for them.
Demonology will get Demonic Fury, you build up Demonic Fury and you metamorphosize when you max your Demonic Fury. More skills will be added to Demon Form, etc ...
Destruction will get Infernal Embers. The destruction warlock who keeps getting casting fire spells get hotter and hotter and will eventually deal insane amount of damage, you can build it up pretty quickly and unleash your big spell.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman

Buff totems are gone. It just wasn't very interesting to be the buff bitch of the group.
All totems are now utility
New totem examples:
Earthgrab totem - roots
Repulsion totem - repels
Bulwark Totem - absorbs


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid 

They always felt like they had 4 specs, so now they do. 
Feral - Cat melee dps
Guardian - bear tanking
Some overlap between the two
All druids can still go cat or bear form.


All classes

Spell books cleaned up, got rid of more junk, the goal is to clean up action bars a little more without removing the fun things.
Rotations will be improved
Spells will be automatically learned, you won't have to go to your trainer anymore. 
You will get a new spell at level 87, level 90 new talent point.
Talent trees should be fun, and you should have more choice than just a cookie cutter build.
