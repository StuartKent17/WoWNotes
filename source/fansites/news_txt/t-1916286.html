Legion - Human Racial Changes<br>
In the next version of the Legion Alpha, we&#x2019;re adjusting the Human racial &#x2018;Every Man for Himself&#x2019; to only remove stun effects. The racial will share a 30 second cooldown with other similar effects.<br>
<br>
Due to the changes to PvP gear and the introduction of PvP talents in Legion, the Warlords of Draenor implementation of Every Man for Himself (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/59752-every-man-for-himself) no longer makes sense. So instead, we&#x2019;re trying out an implementation that functions similar to Will of the Forsaken (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/7744-will-of-the-forsaken). It will only break Stun effects, but won&#x2019;t trigger the full 2-minute cooldown on your Gladiator&#x2019;s Medallion ability (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/42292-pvp-trinket) (which is the Legion version of the current Medallion trinkets).<br>
<br>
As always, this change isn&apos;t final, and we&#x2019;re looking for feedback from testers once they&#x2019;ve had some time with it. Please feel free to share your initial thoughts on this here, and for Alpha testers, take your feedback to the Alpha general discussion forum.<br>

The Amalgam of Souls<br>
Immense soul energy was released when Gul&apos;dan conducted the ritual to sever Illidan&apos;s soul from his body at Black Rook Hold. This energy brought the souls of the Ravencrest clan back to their ancestral home - and residual soul energy has merged them into a massive monstrosity.<br>

Kur&apos;talos Ravencrest, Lord of Black Rook Hold, was the commander of the Kal&apos;dorei Resistance during the War of the Ancients until he was assassinated by Varo&apos;then under the orders of Queen Aszhara.

Legion Alpha - Adventure Map Fix<br>
With a final data hotfix, code hotfix, and binary build deployed out, we&apos;ve gotten this issue resolved and in as good of a state as we can with this server build.<br>
<br>
That said, if you were able to bypass the map and manually went to the zones, it&apos;s possible that certain NPCs are in a different phase than your own. We&apos;re looking into this, but that&apos;s likely a problem we can&apos;t solve today. It&apos;s still worth entering bug reports for since it&apos;s a legitimate way players could get broken on live retail servers when the expansion launches.<br>
<br>
Thanks for being patient as we go through this, we tracked down some problems with how certain files are committed to public data containers vs internal local files. This is why your Alpha/Beta/PTR testing is so important - you&apos;re playing through the game in a public client, which hits a lot of different areas that we don&apos;t see internally (ideally this is the same content, but in terms of installation/updating/streaming it&apos;s a different beast.)<br>
<br>
Testing is terrific!<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler talks about game design and occasionally WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
1.) If you are a hardcore gamer, how do you know how to design a game for a casual audience? Or even a broad audience?<br>
1. You need a ton of empathy and probably a lot of playtesting with casual players. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671880125110087684))<br>
<br>
4.) Arent factions in mmorpgs contrary to best gameplay? As like building bgs out of mercenaries and not tauren versus gnomes<br>
4. But factions add a lot of emotional investment. The &quot;us vs them&quot; drive is strong in humans. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671880868529475584))<br>

5.) Why so many skinner boxes? In special in MMORPGs. Sometimes i feel like a pigeon pushing the bacon button..<br>
5. Games are ultimately about using tools to overcome obstacles to earn rewards. The best games don&apos;t make it so obvious though. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671881035504738304))<br>

6.) How could a mythic raider create a engaging LFR implementation? If he never plays it.<br>
6. I was a mythic raider and I was largely the LFR designer. I just tried to put myself in that mind set. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671881210793070592))<br>
6. You might not like LFR (and I am pretty honest about its shortcomings) but I don&apos;t think they stem from my being too hardcore (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671881369438437376))<br>

8.) Is the balancing concept in WoW something like &quot;Perfect imbalance&quot; or was the intend rock-paper-scissors-spock-lizard?<br>
8) When I was there, it was intended to be that you have strengths and weaknesses and so does everyone else. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671881740386865152))<br>
8) I can&apos;t speak to their philosophy today obviously. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671881785123299328))<br>
