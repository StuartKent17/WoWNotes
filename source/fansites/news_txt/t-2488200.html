Patch 8.2 PTR - Conflict and Strife PvP Talent Changes<br>

Blizzard previously mentioned that the initial talents were not final and would be changed. To see the talents that haven&apos;t changed, check out our initial preview (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8530-Patch-8-2-PTR-Conflict-and-Strife-PvP-Talent-Essence).<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
The chosen abilities in PTR data are not final. In particular, the ones that would clearly be overpowered or problematic in PvE (such as Leader of the Pack) are generally cases where the final decision of which PvP Talent to give hasn&#x2019;t yet been made.<br>
<br>
The primary goal of Conflict and Strife is to provide an interesting choice in PvP by allowing access to an extra PvP Talent. It&#x2019;s not necessarily going to be a strong option for PvE. The acquisition of this Essence is via PvP, and is totally optional for PvE-focused players. While there may be interesting PvE uses for some of the choices, it is not expected to be a strong competitor on usual PvE criteria (like total throughput) on every spec.<br>
