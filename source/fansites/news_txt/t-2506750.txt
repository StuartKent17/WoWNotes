It only took a week to see the first world first kill of Ragnaros on the new classic server, and we owe the crazy performance to <APES> on the european Gehennas server! 

The original world first kill of Ragnaros was 154 days after the initial release of the raid, years of game knowledge and practice took this down to just 6 days!
