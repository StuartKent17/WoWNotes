Classes
Currently Horde has 1 more race/class combo than Alliance... any chance we'll see parity in WoD? Night Elf Paladins FTW!
Count of race/class combos isn't something we aim to balance. Celestalon 

Could we see guardians Garg, S.fiend... benefiting from %dmg buffs Primordius f.ex in the same way pets do?
It's a bug whenever they don't. Celestalon 
Will full pets always benefit? Didn't on H stone guardians/protectors of endless for sure. Possibly sha of pride and norushen?
Yes. Any encounter buffs to your damage should affect your pets and guardians as well. Celestalon 

I am so sick of doing less damage than others of my spec b/c of total rng. Why bother trying in ur rppm joke game?
RNG actually has relatively little effect on total DPS over a whole fight. How you respond to that RNG is bigger though. Celestalon 

Don't you feel that too many ground-targeted spells suffer from the 'No path available issue?'
It's "2", but yes, that's too many. Unfortunately required in order to prevent exploits. Celestalon 
It's really annoying with totemic projection, impossible to tell wether or not it will work at times.
Ah, forgot that one, yep. Totemic Projection, Demonic Gateway, and Heroic Leap. Oh, bah, Banners too. Celestalon 
Never really got why it's fine for warriors to scale, nigh vertical terrain with charge but not heroic leap.
Because we know that it's fine for the warrior to be up there, because someone else already is. #TransitiveProperty Celestalon 

Any chance active talents on the same tier could all get a "Mage Bomb" style button?
Yes. We will do this when it's appropriate similar role, all actives. Celestalon 
I think means talents from the same tier should auto-update on the ability bar after switching chosen talent.
Right, that's what I responded to, no? Celestalon 

6.0 tanks will do 70%? dmg of a DD-since you can kill every boss with every tank, isn't it obivous best dmg tank>other tanks?
No... We'll be balancing tank DPS just as much as we balance DPS DPS. Tanks have their own strengths and weaknesses, as always. Celestalon 
Are things like Monk single tanking Blood Rage on 25H intended?
Wasn't an expected way to handle it, but it doesn't cause any problems, so we're fine with it. Celestalon 

have u considered giving other classes abilitys like charge and disengage its more fun with more movement abilities in combat
Yes, they are quite fun. Almost all classes/specs have movement abilities like that. Celestalon 

 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Any plan on removing the big dmg penalty on Glyph of Enduring Infections ? Losing a glyph slot should be enough.
No, that's an intentional nerf to their damage, since the effect is so gigantic in PvP. Celestalon 
So no plan on even basic dispell protection for Necrotic plague ?
The glyph would affect Necrotic Plague. Additionally, it can still spread from a diseased target to a just-dispelled target. Celestalon 
If I infect Mobs A and B manually using plague strike, does the spread from B stack with the application on A?
No, it only spreads to targets that aren't already infected. Celestalon 

Unholy four piece feels bland, mind taking a look at it or possibly changing it to something more fun.
It's OK for some set bonuses to feel bland. Hopefully not all, but occasionally alright. Celestalon 
But, I mean, even off pieces contribute more then the four piece itself simply b/c of better itemization. It's very weak imo.
Again, it doesn't have to be the case that everyone always uses their tier set. Occasionally not is alright. Celestalon 

If you remove the damage bonuses from DK strikes granted by diseases, what role do diseases serve?
...damage? Am I missing something? Celestalon 
And if you remove those % bonuses, what role do diseases serve in the DK rotation and class overall?
Yes, those are getting baked in. Simplifies and lessens rampup a bit. Diseases serve to do damage, that's unchanged. Celestalon 
Are you concerned about the return of diseaseless rotations?
Not really. We've majorly buffed diseases since those were a thing. We'll fix it if it ever seems optimal. Celestalon 
might seem likely that frost might move to a single disease rotation unless blood plague becomes more attractive.
Yeah, that'd be the one that got dropped if any do. We'll make sure that it doesn't happen unintentionally. Celestalon 
what is blood's motivation to use frost fever? Could have missed a passive that boosts it
Damage/Threat, and the fact that it's freely applied with Outbreak, and freely maintained with Scarlet Fever. Very low opp cost. Celestalon 

What is the plan for multistrike concerning attacks that don't deal direct damage like Necrotic strike ?
I don't recall offhand if Necrotic's debuff stacks. If so, that solves it automatically. If not, may have to do something. Celestalon 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Was Thrash intended to be part of Ferals single target toolbox? For WoD will you attempt to discourage its use in single target?
It's a minor DPS gain to use on OoC procs, which we're fine with. Celestalon 

For Eclipse states only, not anything else. Feral will retain the same thing with Tiger's Fury.
Yeah. Eclipse and Tiger's Fury will be snapshotted. Things like int procs will not be. Extension by X sec, not X ticks. Celestalon 
So basically if I crit with Starfire outside Eclipse the DoT is extended and is calculated by current stats?
Extending doesn't change damage. Damage always uses current stats, except for Eclipse state which is saved at cast time Celestalon 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Fire mage with shatter is kinda 'unfinished' design since doesn't have enough novas for constant DPS support. So whatever you do,
Mages were one of the first classes redesigned in MoP with goal of sharing more across specs. Certainly hurt spec identity. holinka 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Any plans for a WW statue for monks in WoD? We feel left out!
Totally depends on if we have something that would fit well for a statue to do for them. Celestalon 

Are you guys happy with WW Monk's Sparring? It just feels too random and annoying for both the Monk and his opponents.
It was originally intended to be a significant gameplay impactor, but turned out to be much weaker than intended. May revise. Celestalon 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Any plans to improve spriest single target for 6.0 regardless of spec? Buff MF with an extra ticks/cast perhaps?
Yes, we have a plan to allow Shadow Priests to specialize more in how they focus/spread their damage. Celestalon 

Spriests are doing okay on Malkorok thanks to ABUSING close to 100% uptime on ToF. 15% increase and we still suck. PI Baseline!
That's not abusing. That's the intended use of Twist of Fate. Celestalon 
Whoa, whoa, hold on there. The intended use of Twist of Fate is to cheat into ways to have it up 100%? Seriously?
The intended use of Twist of Fate is to maximize its uptime. That should be fairly obvious. There are many ways to do that. Celestalon 
Sure, but I'm trying to understand why tanks standing in fire for Vengeance is bad and spriests locking themselves at 20% isn't.
SPriests locking themselves at 20% is just one way to do it, and a not the ideal one. Definitely not what you should do with a PUG Celestalon 

This sounds flipping awful for raiding. DA is already a huge, HUGE issue in healing right now, and this..is more?
I think you must have misunderstood something. This isn't something that makes DA relatively stronger. Celestalon 
Pretty sure Tiriel is trying to say the game does not need more things to proc DA.
Right, and that's not the case here. This isn't causing more DA. It just isn't causing any less DA. Celestalon 
It definitely would be an additional source of DA. It might not be a lot more DA but it would be more none the less.
Again, misunderstanding. It's a stat that you trade other stats for. If you trade crit for MS, your DA goes down. Any other, equal Celestalon 
It's still another -source- of DA. It's something else that can result in bubbles.
Talking past each other. 100heal+30DA vs 50heal+15DA+50heal+15DA. Same net result. 'Count' of DA sources doesn't matter. Celestalon 
We do not -need- another source of DA. I don't care if it "evens out." We have too many sources of the damn thing as is!
What I'm saying is that you're imagining a relation to a different problem. This is 100% unrelated to DA. No effect on DA prob. Celestalon 
Wouldn't more -sources- of DA give more opportunity for DA bubbles to be created? Because each heal event is a separate roll?
Opportunities, sure. But that *really doesn't matter*. Really. You're trading one 5k DA for two 2k DAs. Celestalon 
But it's more people with absorbs on them.
Still doesn't matter. I promise you. Celestalon 

You're missing the point. Disc with crit stacked now = lots of DAs. Disc with crit and MS in WoD = tons of DAs.
False. Utterly false. [Disc with Crit and MS] = *less* DA than [Disc with pure Crit].This *reduces* the amount of DA. Celestalon 

You guys said you'd monitor DS/Halo, and then you just didn't bother to change it. You are the ones who let Disc go nuts.
Yes, and that was a big mistake. Celestalon 

-don't see a problem with the overwhelming amount of DA, or that it's shutting healers out, and making the game unfun.
I don't? I've been really clear that it's the opposite. It *is* a problem. Celestalon 

What do you think of a Shadow Crash style AoE shadow orb finisher for SPriests? idea by Yvaelle. 
Shadow doesn't have an AoE generator, so having an AoE spender might be odd. Celestalon 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
what do you think about rogues in orgrimmar raid?
Rogues are doing quite well. Celestalon 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Are you happy with how affliction works now ? many locks miss multidoting and SB and hate Malefic Grasp. 35% haunt kills dots.
Not sure how any Affliction Warlocks can 'miss' multidotting... It really hasn't gone anywhere. Celestalon 

Were you prepared for the extent of or did you underestimate the outcry unleased when you nerfed Kilj'aedens Cunning?
Yes. We knew that its users would be unhappy, but also knew that is was for the best, and that the pros outweighed the cons. Celestalon 
How do you plan to nerf the current amazing state of warlocks for WoD in terms of their toolkit without causing said uproar?
We haven't started giving out class change details yet. But it should be obvious that the DoT snapshotting change is huge. Celestalon 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Why does readiness affecting cd sof warrior's talent abilities but not other classes? Is this still the case in WoD?
Warriors talent into more of their CDs, and have a whole row of CD talents. Readiness can affect a whole row without imbalance. Celestalon 
what about hunter's 90 talent? not affected by the AoC
Hunters had enough benefit to AoC without it. With Readiness in 6.0, we can tune the rating coefficient so that we can affect those. Celestalon 
so readiness will be a complicated stat that no general rule to tell which ability will be affeted?
It will be the same complication as Mastery. Similar passive in spellbook and character sheet that details what it affects by spec. Celestalon 

You're not planning to mess with fury come WOD, are you? It plays perfect now, would hate to see any major changes.
Fury is generally in a good place. It'll need a bit of change to make Haste valuable, but that shouldn't feel unnatural. Celestalon 
I don't like how drastic it changes with gear in play style. It's so crit or bust.
Part of we want to do is balance the value of secondary stats better. Celestalon 

Art
Great job of your team! /bow, but can you give us any new informations about quivers? Did you already work on it?
Determined to make this happen, no ETA. Any ideas for equivalent of this for classes without doctrinal class specific attachment? artofcgrobinson 
There was a quiver in the WoD Announcement trailer, so why is there no technical limitation? THIS model is good and enough
trailer models are diff than ingame models, they have no limitations. artofcgrobinson 
In case you missed it, there actually WAS a quiver in the MoP BETA: 
that's what I'm hearing, will have to look into that artofcgrobinson 

PvE
please help! i've seen a lot of back and forth on this, do pets' attacks give General Nazgrim rage in defensive stance?
Pets/guardians do not cause Nazgrim to gain rage while in Defensive Stance. WatcherDev 


Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud 
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud  will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
New GPUs from AMD are here, at least on paper. Finding any AMD GPUs is hard now, as is finding some of the Nvidia GPUs. Prices for many GPUs went up due to demand and the older GPUs being discontinued. 

The current SSD prices  are stable, with most SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. 

The Haswell CPUs  run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14  

Mid and higher end AMD GPUs aren't in stock anywhere, or if they are the prices are far too high. This makes Nvidia the only choice for most builds right now.

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions! If you are interested in Folding@home, take a look in our team's thread
