Currently Horde has 1 more race/class combo than Alliance... any chance we'll see parity in WoD? Night Elf Paladins FTW!
Count of race/class combos isn't something we aim to balance. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425490197782872065

Could we see guardians Garg, S.fiend... benefiting from %dmg buffs Primordius f.ex in the same way pets do?
It's a bug whenever they don't. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426293476628504576
Will full pets always benefit? Didn't on H stone guardians/protectors of endless for sure. Possibly sha of pride and norushen?
Yes. Any encounter buffs to your damage should affect your pets and guardians as well. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426420439091388417

I am so sick of doing less damage than others of my spec b/c of total rng. Why bother trying in ur rppm joke game?
RNG actually has relatively little effect on total DPS over a whole fight. How you respond to that RNG is bigger though. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426281542889902081

Don't you feel that too many ground-targeted spells suffer from the 'No path available issue?'
It's "2", but yes, that's too many. Unfortunately required in order to prevent exploits. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426151955975524352
It's really annoying with totemic projection, impossible to tell wether or not it will work at times.
Ah, forgot that one, yep. Totemic Projection, Demonic Gateway, and Heroic Leap. Oh, bah, Banners too. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426154196832763904
Never really got why it's fine for warriors to scale, nigh vertical terrain with charge but not heroic leap.
Because we know that it's fine for the warrior to be up there, because someone else already is. #TransitiveProperty Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426199926008078337

Any chance active talents on the same tier could all get a "Mage Bomb" style button?
Yes. We will do this when it's appropriate similar role, all actives. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425853861593509889
I think means talents from the same tier should auto-update on the ability bar after switching chosen talent.
Right, that's what I responded to, no? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426100182623588352

6.0 tanks will do 70%? dmg of a DD-since you can kill every boss with every tank, isn't it obivous best dmg tank>other tanks?
No... We'll be balancing tank DPS just as much as we balance DPS DPS. Tanks have their own strengths and weaknesses, as always. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425299926109519872
Are things like Monk single tanking Blood Rage on 25H intended?
Wasn't an expected way to handle it, but it doesn't cause any problems, so we're fine with it. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425854936123838464

have u considered giving other classes abilitys like charge and disengage its more fun with more movement abilities in combat
Yes, they are quite fun. Almost all classes/specs have movement abilities like that. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425854109862744064

Any plan on removing the big dmg penalty on Glyph of Enduring Infections ? Losing a glyph slot should be enough.
No, that's an intentional nerf to their damage, since the effect is so gigantic in PvP. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425850998246998017
So no plan on even basic dispell protection for Necrotic plague ?
The glyph would affect Necrotic Plague. Additionally, it can still spread from a diseased target to a just-dispelled target. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426090524513034241
If I infect Mobs A and B manually using plague strike, does the spread from B stack with the application on A?
No, it only spreads to targets that aren't already infected. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426297247534309377

Unholy four piece feels bland, mind taking a look at it or possibly changing it to something more fun.
It's OK for some set bonuses to feel bland. Hopefully not all, but occasionally alright. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426169198549540865
But, I mean, even off pieces contribute more then the four piece itself simply b/c of better itemization. It's very weak imo.
Again, it doesn't have to be the case that everyone always uses their tier set. Occasionally not is alright. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426170652286935040

If you remove the damage bonuses from DK strikes granted by diseases, what role do diseases serve?
...damage? Am I missing something? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425371963763474432
And if you remove those % bonuses, what role do diseases serve in the DK rotation and class overall?
Yes, those are getting baked in. Simplifies and lessens rampup a bit. Diseases serve to do damage, that's unchanged. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425373200143220736
Are you concerned about the return of diseaseless rotations?
Not really. We've majorly buffed diseases since those were a thing. We'll fix it if it ever seems optimal. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425374182650556417
might seem likely that frost might move to a single disease rotation unless blood plague becomes more attractive.
Yeah, that'd be the one that got dropped if any do. We'll make sure that it doesn't happen unintentionally. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425490034213396480
what is blood's motivation to use frost fever? Could have missed a passive that boosts it
Damage/Threat, and the fact that it's freely applied with Outbreak, and freely maintained with Scarlet Fever. Very low opp cost. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425855880760791040

What is the plan for multistrike concerning attacks that don't deal direct damage like Necrotic strike ?
I don't recall offhand if Necrotic's debuff stacks. If so, that solves it automatically. If not, may have to do something. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425302851393314816

Was Thrash intended to be part of Ferals single target toolbox? For WoD will you attempt to discourage its use in single target?
It's a minor DPS gain to use on OoC procs, which we're fine with. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425312517120733184

For Eclipse states only, not anything else. Feral will retain the same thing with Tiger's Fury.
Yeah. Eclipse and Tiger's Fury will be snapshotted. Things like int procs will not be. Extension by X sec, not X ticks. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425302418377539584
So basically if I crit with Starfire outside Eclipse the DoT is extended and is calculated by current stats?
Extending doesn't change damage. Damage always uses current stats, except for Eclipse state which is saved at cast time Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425305429514522624

Fire mage with shatter is kinda 'unfinished' design since doesn't have enough novas for constant DPS support. So whatever you do,
Mages were one of the first classes redesigned in MoP with goal of sharing more across specs. Certainly hurt spec identity. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/425840949617381376

Any plans for a WW statue for monks in WoD? We feel left out!
Totally depends on if we have something that would fit well for a statue to do for them. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425858135413116928

Are you guys happy with WW Monk's Sparring? It just feels too random and annoying for both the Monk and his opponents.
It was originally intended to be a significant gameplay impactor, but turned out to be much weaker than intended. May revise. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425301119259013120

Any plans to improve spriest single target for 6.0 regardless of spec? Buff MF with an extra ticks/cast perhaps?
Yes, we have a plan to allow Shadow Priests to specialize more in how they focus/spread their damage. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426453135947620357

Spriests are doing okay on Malkorok thanks to ABUSING close to 100% uptime on ToF. 15% increase and we still suck. PI Baseline!
That's not abusing. That's the intended use of Twist of Fate. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425849098567041024
Whoa, whoa, hold on there. The intended use of Twist of Fate is to cheat into ways to have it up 100%? Seriously?
The intended use of Twist of Fate is to maximize its uptime. That should be fairly obvious. There are many ways to do that. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426074307899322368
Sure, but I'm trying to understand why tanks standing in fire for Vengeance is bad and spriests locking themselves at 20% isn't.
SPriests locking themselves at 20% is just one way to do it, and a not the ideal one. Definitely not what you should do with a PUG Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426125552370470912

This sounds flipping awful for raiding. DA is already a huge, HUGE issue in healing right now, and this..is more?
I think you must have misunderstood something. This isn't something that makes DA relatively stronger. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425295063292182528
Pretty sure Tiriel is trying to say the game does not need more things to proc DA.
Right, and that's not the case here. This isn't causing more DA. It just isn't causing any less DA. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425304219017433088
It definitely would be an additional source of DA. It might not be a lot more DA but it would be more none the less.
Again, misunderstanding. It's a stat that you trade other stats for. If you trade crit for MS, your DA goes down. Any other, equal Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425310174065094656
It's still another -source- of DA. It's something else that can result in bubbles.
Talking past each other. 100heal+30DA vs 50heal+15DA+50heal+15DA. Same net result. 'Count' of DA sources doesn't matter. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425340312194527232
We do not -need- another source of DA. I don't care if it "evens out." We have too many sources of the damn thing as is!
What I'm saying is that you're imagining a relation to a different problem. This is 100% unrelated to DA. No effect on DA prob. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425341890192363520
Wouldn't more -sources- of DA give more opportunity for DA bubbles to be created? Because each heal event is a separate roll?
Opportunities, sure. But that *really doesn't matter*. Really. You're trading one 5k DA for two 2k DAs. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425343431255146496
But it's more people with absorbs on them.
Still doesn't matter. I promise you. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425343822499811328

You're missing the point. Disc with crit stacked now = lots of DAs. Disc with crit and MS in WoD = tons of DAs.
False. Utterly false. [Disc with Crit and MS] = *less* DA than [Disc with pure Crit].This *reduces* the amount of DA. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425342929096290304

You guys said you'd monitor DS/Halo, and then you just didn't bother to change it. You are the ones who let Disc go nuts.
Yes, and that was a big mistake. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425341407952248832

-don't see a problem with the overwhelming amount of DA, or that it's shutting healers out, and making the game unfun.
I don't? I've been really clear that it's the opposite. It *is* a problem. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425341333721468928

What do you think of a Shadow Crash style AoE shadow orb finisher for SPriests? idea by Yvaelle. http://t.co/p0b8eLDncG
Shadow doesn't have an AoE generator, so having an AoE spender might be odd. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425298952557039618

Are you happy with how affliction works now ? many locks miss multidoting and SB and hate Malefic Grasp. 35% haunt kills dots.
Not sure how any Affliction Warlocks can 'miss' multidotting... It really hasn't gone anywhere. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426110218259292160

Were you prepared for the extent of or did you underestimate the outcry unleased when you nerfed Kilj'aedens Cunning?
Yes. We knew that its users would be unhappy, but also knew that is was for the best, and that the pros outweighed the cons. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425851468164251648
How do you plan to nerf the current amazing state of warlocks for WoD in terms of their toolkit without causing said uproar?
We haven't started giving out class change details yet. But it should be obvious that the DoT snapshotting change is huge. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425853550992687104

Why does readiness affecting cd sof warrior's talent abilities but not other classes? Is this still the case in WoD?
Warriors talent into more of their CDs, and have a whole row of CD talents. Readiness can affect a whole row without imbalance. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426419809815769088
what about hunter's 90 talent? not affected by the AoC
Hunters had enough benefit to AoC without it. With Readiness in 6.0, we can tune the rating coefficient so that we can affect those. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426424703897440256
so readiness will be a complicated stat that no general rule to tell which ability will be affeted?
It will be the same complication as Mastery. Similar passive in spellbook and character sheet that details what it affects by spec. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426429678140682240

You're not planning to mess with fury come WOD, are you? It plays perfect now, would hate to see any major changes.
Fury is generally in a good place. It'll need a bit of change to make Haste valuable, but that shouldn't feel unnatural. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425296445080469504
I don't like how drastic it changes with gear in play style. It's so crit or bust.
Part of we want to do is balance the value of secondary stats better. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425672198108356609

Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
New GPUs from AMD are here, at least on paper. Finding any AMD GPUs is hard now, as is finding some of the Nvidia GPUs. Prices for many GPUs went up due to demand and the older GPUs being discontinued. 

The current SSD prices http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/february/ssdgraph.gif are stable, with most SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. 

The Haswell CPUs http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1 run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&tag=mmochamp-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A. 

Mid and higher end AMD GPUs aren't in stock anywhere, or if they are the prices are far too high. This makes Nvidia the only choice for most builds right now.

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx and Nvidia http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/290-Computer for any extra questions!
