Update - Added the US announcement for the Crowd Chose You!!! (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/144389-the-crowd-chose-you) Hotfix<br>
<br>
Upcoming The Crowd Chose You!!! Hotfix<br>
With Patch 5.4, we added a mechanic called &quot;The Crowd Chose You&quot; to Arena gameplay. This mechanic was added to suit two primary goals: keep the game from dragging on too long, and make sure matches always end with one team declared the winner. However, we wanted something that wouldn&#x2019;t make players feel they needed to change how they played the game. Unfortunately, the implementation of The Crowd Chose You that went live with Patch 5.4 is not filling that last requirement.<br>
<br>
So, we&#x2019;re going to take a different approach. In an upcoming hotfix, we&#x2019;ll be removing The Crowd Chose You entirely, and replacing it with a new mechanic called Dampening. If a match should last for 10 minutes, all players in the Arena will begin to receive a stacking debuff that reduces healing done by 1% every 10 seconds. This will continue until one team is eventually able to claim the victory. In the extremely unlikely event that neither team has won after 20 minutes, the match will end in a draw.<br>
<br>
We feel that this mechanic will have a much smaller impact on playstyle, team composition, and decision making than The Crowd Chose You, and thus result in more fun and exciting matches. We&#x2019;re currently testing the hotfix internally, and will provide an update when it goes live.<br>

Restoration<br>
<br>
To help address issues with input lag, Efflorescence now heals for twice as much every 2 seconds (was once every 1 second). Additional adjustments have been made so the total amount healed by Efflorescence from Swiftmend, Force of Nature Treants, and Wild Mushroom remains unchanged.<br>

Faction Restricted Classes<br>
it made raid tuning very hard for blizzard as they pretty much ended up having to have 2 versions to take into account the class differences <br>
Raid tuning was an issue for sure, but PvP balance was also a concern when the decision came to make Shamans and Paladins available to both factions... I believe this decision was made around the same time the first Arenas were being added to the game. <br>
<br>
Before then, Shamans and Paladins were often &quot;unknowns&quot; for the opposite factions, meaning that the abilities, strengths, and weaknesses of these classes weren&apos;t well known by players of the opposite faction, and that made them harder to fight for many. These &quot;unknowns&quot; also lead to many misconceptions and a lot of confusion, which often manifested in nerf spam campaigns on the forums. <br>
<br>
I still shudder from time to time from the memories of having to moderate the forums during the massive &quot;Vin Diesel plays a Shaman&quot; nerf campaign back in 2005/2006. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/274305-faction-restricted-classes/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8381448063?page=1#11))<br>
<br>
Season 14 Two Handed Maces<br>
There is no two-handed mace available in season 14, the same as there isn&apos;t a Crossbow available in season 14 for Conquest points. It&apos;s actually very normal for there not to be every single weapon type available during each season. The same thing has happened in previous seasons but for other weapon types and in season 15, there may be two-handed maces available again. <br>
<br>
If your preference is to use a mace as your weapon we can understand your frustration, especially if you happen to play a Dwarf, however if you plan on wielding a two-handed weapon this season then you&apos;ll need to decide between a sword and an axe.

Flex Raiding<br>
Greg, any thoughts on making Flex loot tradeable in guild groups? Got a few items I wish had gone elsewhere. Thanks!<br>
Long term it&apos;s probably a requirement, but we currently don&apos;t have a way to drop more loot for larger groups. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384849288632614912))<br>
<br>
Can you give us any idea of Flex participation relative to normal? I&apos;m excited to see if it&apos;s as highly popular as it seems.<br>
It&apos;s as or more popular than normal and growing. It makes sense that flex could grow to be far more popular than normal. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384844799473250305))<br>
<br>
UI / Addons<br>
Is there any possibility that blizz let us set factions like The Tillers or Horde Expedition to inactive?<br>
It&apos;s a known issue with factions that have sub-factions. We&apos;d like to fix it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/386139447059697664))<br>
<br>
Reputation / Questing<br>
didnt you wrote you want to remove the prerequisite &quot;wind serpent riding&quot; for alts? Its still in the game, unfortunately<br>
I believe I said we could consider it. With all of the catch up mechanisms, it&apos;s pretty fast for alts to get there. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385581337265963008))<br>
<br>
Class Balance Discussion<br>
This may sound backwards, but try using &quot;I&quot; more often and &quot;we&quot; less often in your feedback. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/386140778197565440))<br>
I use &quot;we&quot; a lot, but I know the values and intentions of my fellow developers in a way you cannot know for all players. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/386141116761772032))<br>
<br>
This will help communicate from the players to the devs. Unlike the forums, it&apos;s easier to read.<br>
Surveys don&apos;t provide context. I care more about when you feel less mobile more than whether you rank mobility a 2. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/386572681140649984))<br>
<br>
And to be clear, I do think that blues should always be very careful when they decide to post in a class forum.<br>
I don&apos;t personally post in class forums anymore (or rarely anywhere). It caused more QQ than it solved IMO. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374987547690020864))<br>
If blues won&apos;t post in class specific forums why even have them?<br>
They are intended for players to be able to discuss class issues with fellow players that other class might not find interesting. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385581664820142081))<br>
