It seems that you cannot communicate with other teams anymore during arena matches in 2.3.<br>

Hunter Bugfixes<br>
The hunters nerfs are definitely here on purpose and have been added to the patch notes. You should still be able to drink during trash mobs fights. <br>
Fixed a bug in which Hunters were able to use Readiness in conjunction with Freezing Trap on two different targets.<br>
Fixed a bug in which Hunters were able to disengage from combat using Feign Death during boss encounters. <br>

Skald fire elementals bug<br>
According to this blue post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2968178446&amp;postId=29491835017&amp;sid=1#2), it seems that the fire elementals in Skald (north of Blade&apos;s Edge Mountains) are bugged and instantly respawn. I checked it this morning and it&apos;s still working so I guess it could be a good time to farm primal fires. <br>

Blue posts<br>
