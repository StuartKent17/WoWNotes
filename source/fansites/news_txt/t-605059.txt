Boubouille2008-02-20, 08:26 AMTwin Eredars loot table update
vodka http://www.vodka-guild.com/ and Premonition http://www.premo-guild.com/ killed the Eredar Twins on the US PTRs and got some new loot. It also looks like there was a 3rd kill or a death touch by a GM that dropped more items like Golden Bow of Quel'thalas http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/goldenbowofquelthalas.jpg and Stanchion of Primal Instinct http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/stanchionofprimalinstinct.jpg but I can't directly link them to a kill, however according to the itemID they probably drop from this encounter too.
