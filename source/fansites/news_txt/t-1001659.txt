Boubouille2011-10-20, 05:20 AMDragon Soul PTR Testing - Madness of Deathwing
Exordium http://www.exordium-gaming.com and Pillow Fort http://www.pillow-fort.com managed to unlock the Madness of Deathwing encounter on test realms and actually went through most of it! Obviously it's pretty spoilery and you shouldn't watch it if you don't want to almost see how the last fight of the expansion ends. 

Keep in mind that this fight was not supposed to be tested and is still incredibly bugged and possibly very undertuned.

Description from Youtube Spoilers
Blizzard decided not to open this fight to testing because the jumping from platform to platform was extremely buggy, as you'll see at the end of the video. Basically what you have to do is kill the appendage that's on each platform after killing a big tentacle. Each aspect has their own platform, and when you destroy the appendage on that aspect's platform, you lose the buff they give you. This makes the fight harder as you destroy each platform. 

Due to the bugs with jumping, we were forced to destroy the best platforms first, which made the fight harder though it's still incredibly undertuned. Once we finally cleared all 4 platforms, deathwing slams his head on the middle platform with only 10 mil health, you get all the buffs back, and I assume it's just supposed to be like the last 10% of the Lich King, as it would have been a ridiculously easy burn if we could get over there.

Killars from vodka www.vodka-guild.net spent some of his free time on test realms going through the legendary quest and came back with a few fun pictures! The stats for the first epic version of the daggers are now known, and it also seems that you will need to spend 10,000 gold at some point during the questline.
