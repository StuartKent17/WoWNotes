Patch 7.2.5 - Shoe-Shine Kit
Patch 7.2.5 fixes the previously unavailable Shoe Shine Kit  toy. At midnight PST Sheddle Glossgleam  will leave his regular spot and heads down to the Legerdemain Lounge to drink. A chest will spawn that allows one player or potentially several that are there right away, similar to other shared objects to loot the toy. Thanks to Nightswifty, minorpains, and the Secret Finding Discord for figuring this out!

Is wpvp considered a "non-pvp" situation for this????
No. Situations that activate Honor Talents will also enable Concordance's PvP tuning. WarcraftDevs 

Can you confirm that Cutting Edge: Mythic Gul'dan will be removed once 7.2.5 is released?
Cutting Edge and Ahead of the Curve for Gul'dan will become unavailable once the Tomb of Sargeras raid unlocks. WarcraftDevs

Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Reading your last question got me thinking, why is gaming industry so secretive? I mean not talking about future plans for games etc is obvious since it’s just the way business is, like with movies, you’re not supposed to know sequel to X is coming until it is officially announced. But i mean from inside point of things like how things are created etc. Is it because of competition in technology? entitlement? not wanting to wider up small industry to possibly newcomers that are competition?
It is almost always about trying to manage player expectations.

I’ll use new champions as an example. If I casually talk about a new champion we are working on months in advance, then here are a bunch of bad things that could happen. This isn’t just speculation, because these things usually do happen when something leaks.


Players might get impatient and then finally bored by the time something ships. It becomes “Well, finally, Jeez” instead of excitement.
Related, teases and hype videos think of the “egg” one we did for Xayah and Rakkan are pointless because everyone knows they are coming.
Players talk a lot about designs for which they have no details, and sometimes convince themselves that certain things must be true, and then are disappointed when that is not the case. You see this factor a lot in modern TV shows, when fans spend 100X more time discussing an episode than the actual length of the episode and come up with these labyrinthine explanations or predictions that very often do not pan out.
Players get exposed to temporary, test or bad ideas, and then get disappointed if those get pulled. We still get requests for champions that we killed long ago because some players got excited about them. See also: Magma Chamber, Abyssal Maw raid, etc.
Players draw conclusions based on hacked-in, temporary or test functionality or art. Devs get very leery about showing work-in-progress because players compare it to finished, live content and find the WIP wanting. It’s really easy for the developers to lose control of the message because the community has already formed conclusions.


Now, some studios or devs are really paranoid about competitors stealing their idea, but honestly that’s so hard to do in this business that we should all just stop worrying about it. Developing a new feature takes a lot of time and if you rush it to beat someone to market, you very well might end up with a crappy feature. There are definitely some benefits to being the first game in a particular genre and I know this has benefited League a bunch in some countries, but you can’t forsake everything to be first. Players are more likely to play the second game than a bad game.

Players used to ask if we launched a WoW patch on a particular day in order to compete with a big announcement from some other studio. Alas, if only this industry was that agile. Big launches are cemented months in advance and only slip if catastrophe would ensue sans delay.

Good question. Source
