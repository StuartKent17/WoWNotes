Patch 7.2.5 - Guardian Changes
In my earlier post on this thread, I mentioned we were already considering what the right changes to Guardian would be going into Tomb, but that it was likely going to be for 7.2.5 and not 7.2. In the first 7.2.5 PTR, you can expect to see the following changes to Guardian:

--Mark of Ursol removed
--Maul costs 30 Rage from 20, is now on the GCD, can now proc Gore, and damage increased by 400%.

I imagine the first change is most pertinent to those focused on the broader issue of tank balance. It may seem rather extreme, and that's part of why doing it mid-tier wasn't the plan we went with. But two factors that were important were 1 Mark of Ursol's design trade your physical AM for a magical AM was somewhat incompatible with any use of magic damage other than an occasional threatening spike, and 2 Druids had little in the way of identifiable weaknesses or things that potentially scare them. Even without Mark of Ursol, they have a mastery that's fully effective against magic, multiple medium to long cooldowns, Frenzied Regeneration, and some passives like Adaptive Fur. While we'll be continuing to watch this in 7.2.5 development, our expectation is that they will not struggle to complete content that involves magic damage--which the clearest test of why a button that allows them to mitigate it so much further is not needed at all.


Destruction Warlock Resource Changes in 7.2.5
As we've mentioned before, we’re making a number of changes to the resource model for Destruction Warlocks in the next patch. The goal is to create smoother, more granular, less random Soul Shard generation and make Chaos Bolt casts feel more impactful.

First, for Destruction Warlocks, Soul Shards are being split into parts of 10, which we’re currently calling Soul Shard Fragments. Mechanically, this will be similar to the Mists of Pandaria resource system of Burning Embers, except we want to go with a consistent Soul Shard visual, updated Soul Shard UI work in progress, and name for the resource across all 3 Warlock specs. Some relevant spell changes:


Incinerate generates 1 Soul Shard Fragment. Doubled on critical strikes. Fire and Brimstone talent will cause Incinerate to generate 1 Soul Shard Fragment per target hit, also doubled on critical strikes. Immolate periodic damage has a 50% chance to generate 1 Soul Shard Fragment. 100% chance on critical strikes. Conflagrate generates 6 Soul Shard Fragments. Dimensional Rift artifact active generates 3 Soul Shard Fragments.

The net result of these changes is that every baseline rotational damage spell will contribute to Soul Shard generation, pushing your resource forward at a steady pace.

Second, Soul Shard generation/refund rate is being reduced overall, mainly for the single-target rotation. However, this is coupled with major damage increases to both Soul Shard spenders - Chaos Bolt and Rain of Fire. Combined, this means that Chaos Bolts will be cast less frequently, but they will hit much harder:


Soul Shard refund chance of Soul Conduit talent reduced to 12%. Soulsnatcher artifact bronze trait reduced to 3% per point. Chaos Bolt damage increased by 40%. Rain of Fire damage increased by 25%.

For the AOE rotation, Fire and Brimstone talent will cause Incinerate to generate Soul Shard Fragments per target hit, which would largely push Immolate out of the AOE rotation with enough targets. Alternately, if you want to go down the route of maintaining Immolate on all targets in a clumped AOE situation, Cataclysm talent will have reduced cooldown 30 sec and slightly reduced cast time, making it easier for you to do so.

As usual, everything discussed here will continue to be iterated on during 7.2.5 PTR and may change based on further playtesting and feedback.

Legion Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part 2 - Account Wide Criteria
My account has Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part 1 on my Rogue, but my raid had me swap mains, so now I'm on a Shaman. If I do Pathfinder, Part 2 on my Shaman, will my account still register both achievements as complete for flying?
Yes, as long as Pathfinder Part 1 is complete on your Rogue, when you complete Pathfinder Part 2 on your Shaman it should count for the full meta to allow flying. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
