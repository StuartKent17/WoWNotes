<br>
Took three session to record the voice, first of which was over 7 hours<br>
Voice tries to capture the add real emotion to the characters<br>
Reinhardt has a sad and heartbroken side, hidden behind his armor<br>
This makes his joy so much more special, because he could have died during the fight in the short<br>
Multiple layers and emotions add to the character, <br>
It was not supposed to be Reinhardt who joined Overwatch, but his arrogance caused the death of someone close to him<br>
The voice of Reinhardt is partially based on the father of Darin<br>
<br>
<br>
Lucio<br>
<br>
Jonny Cruz was a camera actor, before becoming the voice of Lucio<br>
Connecting to the character: altruism, mischief, playfulness<br>
Lucio embodies the love, and joy of Overwatch<br>
<br>
<br>
Pharah<br>
<br>
She first did voice acting for Voice of Warcraft<br>
Jen always has to stand when recording<br>
Pharah is a soulful character, and all her actions are motivated by a deeper passion<br>
She was a character who always dreamed of becoming part of Overwatch<br>
This dream was stopped in its tracks when Overwatch disbanded, but then she had a new chance during the call for heroes<br>
The father of Pharah is hinted at in certain comics, and sprays in game<br>
<br>
<br>
Ana<br>
<br>
Ana brings a lot of diversity to the Overwatch team<br>
Eisha in Arabic means Life<br>
The letter that Ana wrote was very personal to her, because at this time her neice was in surgery<br>
She is the embodiment of competence<br>
Extremely self-aware, and this shows during her interactions with other characters<br>
<br>
<br>
Widowmaker<br>
<br>
Widowmaker is all about loss, which she tries to shield<br>
The character becomes a killer to feel alive<br>
Even bad characters, have dynamic sides, making them the hero of their own story<br>
The first ear, she wore very high heels to feel like the character<br>
When recording voice, it has a major physical component<br>
Intensely tragic character, and there is much more to come<br>
<br>
<br>
Doomfist<br>
<br>
When casting for an actor, Andrea listens for something specific that connects them to the character<br>
Sahr was found through a political speech<br>
This was his first time doing a voice for a video game<br>
Doomfist is a character with charm, charisma, and personality<br>
This character had to embody a lot of traits to make him a leader<br>
There is a hidden intimidation<br>
Sahr bases Doomfist on Charles Taylor, who is an infamous person in Liberia, exploiting others to further himself<br>
Doomfist represents the natural and elemental power of the world<br>
<br>
