PvP Season 14 Begins<br>
Season 14 is live in the US and EU, so get to work on your Season 14 Armor Set (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/373-Season-14-Armor-Sets)! The new individual ladders (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/pvp/leaderboards/2v2) are in place and updating. <br>
With sharpened blades and well-honed spells, the time to strike has come! Season 14 has begun, and the leaders of the Horde and the Alliance are once again looking for new champions to carry their factions&#x2019; banners to victory!<br>
<br>
In PvP Season 14, you will no longer need to join or create an Arena team to compete, and thus the current Team Ratings will be removed. You&#x2019;ll now be able to queue for an Arena match in groups of 2, 3, and 5 (in line with the Arena team sizes available in Season 13 and earlier), and your opponents will be selected based on the average Match Making Rating of your party. Personal ratings have been reset.<br>
<br>
You can find a complete overview of the changes in our Patch 5.4 Arena Update (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/10333782) blog.<br>
<br>
<br>
Patch 5.4 Resilience Changes<br>
The increase in base Resilience in patch 5.4 is meant to counterbalance the fact that Resilience is no longer on gear (and thus does not increase as players gear up).<br>
<br>
Prior to 5.3, players&apos; survivability would naturally increase with gear. We didn&apos;t feel that that was creating an environment that would encourage undergeared players to continue playing, so in 5.3, we moved Resilience off of gear and increased base Resilience.<br>
<br>
In Patch 5.4, we needed to do something similar. Since player power is still increasing as players collect more gear, we needed to once again increase base resilience to keep things from getting too out of hand. You&apos;ll still feel like your character is improving as you gear up, this just makes sure you don&apos;t improve to the point where you&apos;re able to kill someone before they have an opportunity to respond. <br>

Conquest Vendors Temporarily Disabled<br>
We&apos;re still working on a fix for the Conquest cap so the Conquest vendors can be brought back. I&apos;ll keep /poking for info but don&apos;t have anything new to share. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/269299-conquest-vendors-temporarily-disabled/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9972358604?page=11#204))<br>
<br>
Raid Finder Difficulty<br>
There are likely tweaks and fixes to be made here and there, but first week of any new LFR wing is like this as people learn the mechanics, and there are always threads like this.<br>
<br>
I notice a number of people discussing about the difficulty of Norushen on Raid Finder. We&apos;re aware that the Look Within phase may currently be incorrectly selecting players; making the fight harder than it needs to be. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/269506-lfr-overtuned/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10014151372?page=6#106))<br>
<br>
Legendary Meta Gems<br>
If you&apos;re referring to the meta-gems awarded by Wrathion from The Crown of Heaven they will continue to work as those gems don&apos;t have a Sha-Touched or Armament of the Thunder King requirement.<br>
<br>
However, there was a change in 5.4 while using meta-gems outside of the intended specialization.<br>
<br>
<br>
Capacitive Primal Diamond (http://www.wowdb.com/items/95346-capacitive-primal-diamond), and Legendary melee cloaks (Fen-Yu, Fury of Xuen, and Gong-Lu, Strength of Xuen) now have a 40% reduced chance to activate its effects for characters that are in a tanking specialization.<br>
<br>
<br>
Which was a very lazy change. Tanks should have wanted to use the tanking items because they were better than the DPS options, not because they DPS options don&apos;t work normally for tank specs.<br>
Good thing we also did this then.<br>
<br>
<br>
Indomitable Primal Diamond (http://www.wowdb.com/items/95344-indomitable-primal-diamond)&apos;s effect now grants a 20% damage reduction to all damage taken (up from only physical damage), and its activation rate has been doubled.<br>

Proving Ground&apos;s NPC Party AI<br>
We&apos;ve actually been making several adjustments to the AI of the NPC party members in the healing Proving Grounds via hotfix. I don&apos;t believe all of the changes have hit yet as I write this, but if all goes well, they should be applied within the next day or so. I&apos;d recommend keeping an eye on the official hotfix blog for updates.

How much data after a patch do you need before you see a balance issue or it a case by case basis?<br>
Case by case. For PvE, the first week has a lot of noise. Folks learning fights... overgeared heroic players gearing alts, etc. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378606971877744641))<br>
<br>
is it frustrating how much emphasis people put on tiny stat/dps difference rather than play their class well/correctly?<br>
Very much so. If a spec swap nets you 2% dps and playing your chosen spec better nets you 20% dps, your priorities are off. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377201330403561473))<br>

There is no way you can buff destro SINGLE target damage without buffing CBolt, but CB is too burtsy in pvp. Solution<br>
We can make CB hit for less in PvP if necessary. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378560151038345216))<br>

Hey GC, can you explain why Warriors are not allowed to transmog their 2h weapons to polearms?<br>
The intention was that they could. We&apos;ll investigate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378555466772541440))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
Legendary cloak contribution to overall dps: 6-8% from personal experience. Do you think that is too much ? People are asking<br>
Is this for a specific spec or across the board? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378554630474444800))<br>
Also consider players likely are playing sub-optimally on bosses they haven&apos;t really learned yet, inflating cloak influence. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378554890332557313))<br>
<br>
Folks, why do you - developers, keep making pve and pvp items with such a dramatic diff in ilvls? 522 vs 572(0\2) ?<br>
So that new / reroll PvP players can quickly get from quest greens to Honor items to Conquest items. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378557045537918976))<br>
<br>
are timeless isle items with a single stat being weaker intentional? kinda frustrating using a burden and getting one.<br>
Unlike normal loot, we cheated on the splitting rules for those TI items. They aren&apos;t weaker, assuming you like that stat. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378283326861082624))<br>
<br>
As I understand it, that&apos;s just how they work. More of a stat costs more. So 3x stats gets more total than 2x or 1x<br>
Typically items with more kinds of stats are more powerful, but not the case for the double stats on the TI randoms. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378555750341029889))<br>
<br>
Raid Finder<br>
It&apos;s just, for some of us, raiding - normal or Flex - is not viable. LFR is all we&apos;ve got. It doesn&apos;t make us inferior.<br>
*Totally* agree. On the other hand, we want to make the rewards for harder difficulties commensurate with their effort. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377941055988961280))<br>
<br>
-esque whiners who complain they aren&apos;t special enough. Punishing LFR runners by delaying SoO&apos;s end by almost a month<br>
We have delayed the final wings of the previous incarnations of LFR. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377913978472525824))<br>
It&apos;s like this: we can&apos;t force LFR groups to wipe for a week before getting a new boss. So we just delay the later bosses. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377914107006951425))<br>
The alternative would be you blaze through all 14 on the first week of LFR and each individual boss doesn&apos;t even get noticed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377914264620498944))<br>
