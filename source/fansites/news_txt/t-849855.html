<br>
Classes<br>
<br>
Area-of-effect abilities such as Consecration (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/26573/consecration/), Efflorescence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/81275/efflorescence/), Healing Rain (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73920/healing-rain/), Holy Word: Sanctuary (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/88667/holy-word-sanctuary/), Ring of Frost (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/82691/ring-of-frost/), and Smoke Bomb (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/76577/smoke-bomb/) now function correctly when cast on any trapdoors (ala Cho&apos;gall) or transports even while the caster is not standing on one of those same objects.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..deathknight) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1116-Death-Knight-Cataclysm))<br>
<br>
Death&apos;s Advance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96270/deaths-advance/) may now not allow movement-impairing effects to reduce the death knight below 60/75% of normal movement speed, down from 75/100%.<br>
Death and Decay (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/43265/death-and-decay/) no longer damages the death knight&apos;s currently selected friendly target when it does damage to nearby target dummies.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..druid) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1117-Druid-Cataclysm))<br>
<br>
Starfall (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48505/starfall/) no longer exceeds 20 stars within its duration.<br>
Mangle (Bear) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/33878/mangle/) and Maul (Bear) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/6807/maul/) damage has been increased by approximately 10%.<br>
Frost Nova (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/122/frost-nova/), Tranquility (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/740/tranquility/), War Stomp (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/20549/war-stomp/), and Starfire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48505/starfall/) are all properly scaled when used by or on a druid in Tree of Life form (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/65139/tree-of-life/). The previous temporary hotfix which removed the ability to use War Stomp while in Tree of Life form has been reverted.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..hunter) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1118-Hunter-Cataclysm))<br>
<br>
Auto Shot (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75/auto-shot/) was not firing while the hunter was moving under certain conditions. Auto Shot should now always function correctly while the hunter is moving.<br>
Having a melee weapon equipped no longer causes the tooltips for Cobra Shot (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77767/cobra-shot/) and Steady Shot (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/56641/steady-shot/) to incorrectly display extra benefit from haste.<br>
The cooldown for Master&apos;s Call (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53271/masters-call/) has been increased to 45 seconds, up from 35. In addition, it can now be dispelled.<br>
The Warp Stalker ability Time Warp (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/35346/time-warp/) can no longer be used on paladins with the Divine Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/642/divine-shield/) buff active.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..mage) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1669-Mage-Cataclysm))<br>
<br>
The Quad Core (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/70747/quad-core/) buff provided by the Sanctified Bloodmage 4-piece set bonus is now properly removed as soon as a spell is cast if the mage does not have 4 pieces of the set equipped.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..paladin) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1670-Paladin-Cataclysm))<br>
<br>
Glyph of Dazing Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/59560/glyph-of-dazing-shield/) correctly causes Avenger&apos;s Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31935/avengers-shield/) to daze the target, and only allows Avenger&apos;s Shield to trigger the dazed effect.<br>
The area-of-effect attack of Hammer of the Righteous (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53595/hammer-of-the-righteous/) no longer has a chance to miss secondary targets when the primary attack hits the paladin&apos;s target. If the primary attack of Hammer of the Righteous fails to hit the target due to miss/dodge/parry/block, no enemies will be affected by the area-of-effect attack. Rogues who are under Cloak of Shadows (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31224/cloak-of-shadows/), however, are able to resist this damage.<br>
The Warp Stalker ability Time Warp (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/35346/time-warp/) can no longer be used on paladins with the Divine Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/642/divine-shield/) buff active.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..priest) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1123-Priest-Cataclysm))<br>
<br>
Inner Focus (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/89485/inner-focus/) can no longer be cast before the effect of its preceding spell completes (Inner Focus will only be applied to spells that are cast after it).<br>
Sin and Punishment (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/87100/sin-and-punishment/) now works properly when two players of the same faction are fighting each other (including in Arenas). A string error may appear when the opponent is feared even though the talent functions correctly.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..rogue) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1122-Rogue-Cataclysm))<br>
<br>
Gouge (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/1776/gouge/) is now breaking properly from spell and ability damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..warlock) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1125-Warlock-Cataclysm))<br>
<br>
All raid bosses are now properly immune to Suffering (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/17735/suffering/) (Voidwalker taunt ability).<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br>
Blackwing Descent<br>
<br>
Drakeadon Mongrels can now be taunted.<br>
The debuff from Pyreclaw&apos;s Flame Buffet now only lasts 8 seconds.<br>
The Golem Sentry&apos;s (http://www.wowpedia.org/Golem_Sentry) Flash Bomb damage has been reduced in the 25-player version.<br>
The health of Drakeadon Mongrels and Drakonid Slayers has been reduced in 10- and 25-player versions.<br>
Nefarian&apos;s (http://www.wowpedia.org/Nefarian_(Blackwing_Descent_tactics)) Blazing Inferno (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/76195/blazing-inferno/) damage and knockdown radius has been reduced to match the spell effect graphic.<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Some Vicious Gladiator&apos;s weapons (item level 359) incorrectly had their costs increased. This has been corrected. Two-hand and ranged weapons now cost 3400 Conquest Points, while one-hand and caster weapons now cost 2450 Conquest Points.<br>
All Vicious Gladiator&apos;s weapons (item level 372) have been temporarily removed from the Glorious Conquest Quartermasters until the time is right to officially introduce them into Azerothian society.<br>
<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
<br>
Many items incorrectly rendered unusable in rated Battlegrounds and Arenas have been made usable again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Battlegrounds<br>
Battle for Gilneas<br>
<br>
The banners at each capture point now take 8 seconds to capture, up from 5. Note that when the banners are neutral and have not yet been captured by either faction at the start of a battle, they will display the wrong location names (Mine says Farm, Waterworks says Blacksmith, and Lighthouse says Stables).<br>
<br>
<br>
Races<br>
<br>
Gift of the Naaru (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/59544/gift-of-the-naaru/) now has a maximum limit to the amount healed when used on friendly NPCs with large amounts of health.</div></div>
