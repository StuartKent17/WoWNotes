09/24 - New Beta Build on the way<br>
Look like another build is on the way, I wasn&apos;t even done with the last one ! See you in a few hours for all the class changes, new items, and cute puppies. <br>
Sorry about that. We missed the 15 minute warning.<br>
<br>
Servers down. New build on the way. ETA is a few hours.<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t have patch notes. Off the top of my head:<br>
<br>
--Heroics have all been re-tuned. We&apos;d really like feedback on the Heroics this push.<br>
--25 person raids have been re-tuned<br>
--Some tuning changes to 10 person raids<br>
--Many class changes. You won&apos;t like the ones made to your own class but you&apos;ll think the changes made to the 9 other classes are all overpowered.<br>
--More Icecrown quests and polish. We&apos;d LOVE more Icecrown quest feedback. Please use the in-game feedback UI or post in the quest forums.<br>
--More Dalaran polish<br>
--Performance updates and new performance logging to help get the servers in good condition.<br>
--We&apos;re working on getting a beta Glyph vendor in the build so you guys will have quick and easy access to all of the glyphs for feedback. That system *might* make this push.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m not the patch note guy but that&apos;s my version of the patch notes.</div></div>
