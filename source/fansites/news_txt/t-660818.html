Val&apos;anyr Hotfixed<br>
We managed to get in a hotfix today that allows periodic healing ticks that were going to overheal entirely to go ahead and fire. Previously they did not fire. This means that effects that were able to proc from HoT ticks that did some healing can now also proc from HoT ticks that overheal completely. The most notable such effect is that Val&apos;anyr&apos;s absorb shield should now work as advertised. All these ticks should now appear in the combat log as well, allowing you to get a fuller sense of your raw healing output from all sources.<br>
<br>
Sorry that we did not comment before now. Given the nature of the bug, we didn&apos;t want to promise anything until we were sure we could fix it. <br>
