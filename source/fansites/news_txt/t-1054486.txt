Mists of Pandaria Dungeons and Raids
We will hear more from Blizzard in January, but while things are quiet we can take this opportunity to review the new features that are coming in Mists of Pandaria http://www.wowpedia.org/World_of_Warcraft:_Mists_of_Pandaria. We begin with the Dungeons and Raid information that was announced so far, using dedicated threads in our Mists of Pandaria forum http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/340-Mists-of-Pandaria-General-Discussions.
