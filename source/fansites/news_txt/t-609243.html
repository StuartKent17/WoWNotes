Q&amp;A Grab Bag<br>
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br>
Sunwell Plateau is the last content patch before the expansion release.<br>
There isn&apos;t any plan to nerf Kil&apos;jaeden right now, he&apos;s intended to be the last boss before the expansion and is meant to be hard. <br>
Raiding armor sets and PvP rewards sets will look different and won&apos;t share the same model anymore in Wrath of the Lich King.<br>
Uldum was on the original list of dungeons to be added to Wrath of the Lich King but right now it&apos;s still unsure if we&apos;ll see it or not. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Raiding armor sets and PvP rewards sets will look different and won&apos;t share the same model anymore in Wrath of the Lich King.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Class Mechanics<br>
Most of the shaman totems, Unleashed Rage, and Battle Shout are some of the buffs changed in WotLK to affect the whole raid instead of the party. <br>
Dynamic Line of Sight will be introduced in WotLK PvP, for exemple a pillar might move up and down every 20 seconds, or we might have movable items. More info about Arenas in tomorrow&apos;s panel.<br>
The attacker/target range mechanics are being re-evaluated it might be changed for Wrath of the Lich King to fix most of the existing bugs, including the ones affecting the attack range of Feral Druids. <br>
Even if it looks like a lot of classes are being changed to make them &quot;more hybrid&quot;, but developers still want to keep the classes as distinct as possible. <br>
There is a plan to give player access to two talent specs to switch between them without having to respec all the time. More details in the future.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
World<br>
You will be able to use your flying mount again at level 77, and might be able to take passengers at level 80. <br>
A harbor will be added to Stormwind to transport players to Northrend, a new zone will be added in Northern Plaguelands as the Death Knight starting area, and an arena will be added to Orgrimmar in place of the existing empty one.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Professions<br>
Inscription trading skill is intended to be for both casters and melees, inscriptions benefits every class. The current plan is to use herbalism as the primary gathering profession. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Death Knight<br>
People playing a Death Knights will see the original voice of their race slightly modified to make it sound more ... Death Knight-ish. <br>
Tanks will be interchangeable in 5-man dungeons but tanks will have a speciality in 25-man raids. Death Knights will be best against casters and shouldn&apos;t be too far behind on other encounters.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Dagger specialization will be improved for rogues in Wrath of the Lich King. <br>

There isn&apos;t any plan to change the soul shard farming as it&apos;s part of the class, but an &quot;emergency soul shard&quot; ability might be added.<br>
<br>

Retribution paladins will share their itemization with Death Knights and Warriors. Their group utility will be increased by making them more efficient DPS-wise. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
