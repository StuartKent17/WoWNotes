Player versus Player

Seething Shore

Seething Shore is now in the Random Battleground queue, starting at level 110.
Mining an Azerite Node now awards 20 Honor was 40 Honor.
The A Good Start achievement now requires 25,000 Azerite was 100,000 Azerite.
The Blood and Sand achievement now displays correctly when linked in chat.
The "Thrust" effect from the Rocket Parachute now has 4 charges was 2 charges, allowing players to reach further areas when jumping from the airship.
The geyser period of Azerite nodes is now extended to 30 seconds was 20 seconds. This will give players more time to reach spawning Azerite nodes.
The respawn time at the graveyard is now 20 seconds was 15 seconds.
The time to cap an Azerite node is increased to 7 seconds was 6 seconds.

Developers’ notes: We’d like to thank you for all your feedback on this new Battleground. The adjustments above should alleviate some of its pacing issues, as well as bring its most-arduous achievement more in line with other battleground achievements.
