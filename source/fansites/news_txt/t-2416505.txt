War of Thorns Chapter 2
Spoilers ahead! The War of Thorns https://wow.gamepedia.com/War_of_the_Thorns quest chain that leads up to the Burning of Teldrassil continues today!


The time gate from last week has been lifted and you can now experience the rest of the Burning of Teldrassil story.
The second half involves Saurfang and his troops taking Lor'danel by surprise while the Alliance tries to stop them. It eventually culminates in Malfurion facing off against Sylvanas and Saurfang interfering. In the end, the tree is left burning and the Alliance players must help evacuate Darnassus.
There is a cinematic that will show at the end of the quest chain.
Alliance players will be rewarded with the Smoldering Reins of the Teldrassil Hippogryph https://beta.wowdb.com/items/163127-smoldering-reins-of-the-teldrassil-hippogryph while the Horde receives the War-Torn Reins of the Undercity Plaguebat https://beta.wowdb.com/items/163128-war-torn-reins-of-the-undercity-plaguebat for completing the entire quest chain.
Stormwind Harbor will now be updated with Darnassian and Gilnean refugees. If a player completes the quest chain Darkshore will also change to have Teldrassil burning in the distance with smoke and ash effects.
