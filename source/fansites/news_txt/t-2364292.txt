chaud2018-01-08, 09:22 PMPatch 7.3.5 - Legendary Tokens Update
Few additional details on the new Legendary token:
We've just pushed a hotfix live that makes Wakening Essences drop for everyone, regardless of whether you're on the quest or not. We'll also be dramatically increasing both the number of Essences required to purchase tokens and the rate at which you gain them in Patch 7.3.5. The overall time investment needed to purchase a token will stay roughly the same, but this will minimize the benefits of stockpiling Essences ahead of time.
Note: Emissary bags earned prior to the release of 7.3.5 will still give pre-7.3.5 numbers of Essences. There is no benefit to saving Emissary bags until afer the patch. We also plan to add Wakening Essences to your first Battleground win of the day in 7.3.5. The tokens are bind on pickup because we don't want to overly encourage players to farm Essences on alt characters in order to feed Legendary items to their mains. However, if you purchase and use a token on a character that already has all of the available legendaries for their class, you will be given a random BoA token for another class.
