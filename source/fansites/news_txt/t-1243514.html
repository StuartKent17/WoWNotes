Blue Tweets<br>
Character<br>
Did devs take into consideration how cost prohibitive upgrading is? its next to impossible to fully upgrade your BiS slots.<br>
One can argue maybe the game was better when everyone didn&apos;t have the expectation of BiS in every slot... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279061311256666112))<br>
<br>
is it safe to say brawlers guild may promote gold buying as people who may not have time to farm gold would wanna try it out?<br>
Gold farming sucks, but we can&apos;t be terrified about having a gold economy in the game. Gold having no value sucks too. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274966108975538176))<br>
<br>
Do you think that the visual design of abilities and gear influences which classes are more popular and most played?<br>
Absolutely. Maybe not for everyone but I believe it contributes a lot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277535605859180544))<br>
<br>
Getting a bit of gear is too complicated; enchant, gem, reforge (all of your gear) and now upgrade. Gem &amp; Ench only was good.<br>
We actually agree with this. Once upon a time you got to put on the gear that dropped when it dropped. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276504529900539904))<br>
Amen. Please remove reforging. Also eliminates need to go to external sites to tell you how exactly to reforge.<br>
We think reforging feels fine for everything except hit and expertise. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276777723953823745))<br>
If you agree, why did you just bring in the upgrade system the other week?<br>
You don&apos;t need to upgrade a piece to wear it. You do need to enchant, gem and reforge. Reforge may be the biggest problem. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276752871893127168))<br>
<br>
last question, did you even consider letting people focus on whatever aspect they enjoy most to progress?<br>
Within reason. E.g. you can&apos;t do achievement to progress. Also what you enjoy may be supported but may not be most efficient. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276776274217816064))<br>
<br>
How is the new race models going along? It&apos;s the only thing that is gonna get me back. Anything more than Dwarf and Orc done?<br>
We&apos;re excited about them but it&apos;s hard to say much more without every word getting over-analyzed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279648672424280064))<br>
OMG, GC said new models will be amazing and perfect and are almost done!!! /sarcasm<br>
Exactly. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279659059832053760))<br>
<br>
.What makes it worse is talents actually at 0% use because either one talent was to well designed or others suck.<br>
Warrior talent diversity isn&apos;t actually bad, with a couple of exceptions like Second Wind. Mage talent diversity is too low. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279405268570365952))<br>
the only pve fight that any competitive fury warrior will use storm bolt for is garalon. Balanced?<br>
No, we think it&apos;s a little weak in both PvE and PvP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279652795735498752))<br>
<br>
Just curious as to why we have the mechanic that sets mana to zero when switching specs? <br>
If the switching cost is too low then it feels like you are supposed to do so every pull, especially for healers. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279404059876806656))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Opinion on double healer comps in 3v3? Should they be viable? Saw 2600 double healer frost mage before today&apos;s Frost Bomb nerf<br>
We are generally fine with non-standard comps as long as they are somewhat uncommon. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279018793026613248))<br>
<br>
Greg, It looks like you are giving burst classes more advantages than dot classes with the mass PvP Power and 1 min trinket<br>
More frequent small bursts is generally a nerf to burst strategies. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279648353472626688))<br>
you explain the nerf part, Please ?<br>
It is generally easier to counter being hit twice for 200K with a short break in between than one hit for 400K. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279657418059837440))<br>
<br>
Wondering if you&apos;re aware of the current talk in arena: feral is OP, frost mage is dead, and healers are too weak; comment?<br>
Feral does seem to be at the top of everyone&apos;s hit list now that mage, warrior and hunter are toned down. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279655564290686976))<br>
<br>
I love how Druids can vanish and ShStep BETTER than rogues and about 6x more often... kudos man. you are a master of balance.<br>
One ability compared to another ability doesn&apos;t scale to one class&apos; comparison to another. It&apos;s about the whole package. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279405596879495168))<br>
<br>
do u think melee damage is out of control atm? specifically feral/dk/warrior... esp w/ healing debuff its just unhealable...<br>
Feral, maybe. DK no. Warriors have been nerfed a ton lately. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279063460069928960))<br>
<br>
prot warrior stands and lets me get him to 35%, kills me (rogue). Having a fantastic time. What class do you want me to play?<br>
Tanks aren&apos;t designed to be killed. That&apos;s why we don&apos;t push them into Arenas. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279064488735543296))<br>
<br>
me and a lot of healers need to be talked off a ledge. I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a reason behind the changes we just aren&apos;t seeing.<br>
Strategically, burst and perma CC are the only options when healers can keep everyone up. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279062090122153984))<br>
Disc priest anyone? Oh nevermind, they dont exist in arena anymore thanks to lazy blanket nerfs.<br>
When healing is too powerful overall, the solution is not to let some specs still have healing that is too powerful. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279644822099337216))<br>
<br>
UI / Addons<br>
hey - is there some sort of UI notice to tell you *if* you bought the extra rep for a faction?<br>
There is not, but we agree that we need to add one. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274968626212249602))<br>
<br>
the issue isn&apos;t mods changing talents, its the ui becoming broken because of unrelated taint (caused by blizzard ui bugs)<br>
I&apos;ll say again, taint = accessing something we want protected. We can decide to make it !protected, but that does take some work. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278687874059223041))<br>
- The problem is it can be reproduced without any mod&apos;s. Which should be addressed. Global variable is tainting.<br>
There isn&apos;t much technical distinction between mods and macros. You&apos;re still trying to access something we want to protect. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278618814776758272))<br>
<br>
Please stop being so restrictive about the Glyph/Talent UI. It&apos;s driving people nuts, I loathe the moment I have to change!<br>
Philosophically, we don&apos;t want automating talent or glyph swaps. Once it&apos;s easy to reglyph every pull, players feel like they must. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278572849529245697))<br>
<br>
He&apos;s Lead Systems Designer. A lot of people take for granted exactly what &quot;systems&quot; entails in game design.<br>
Balance is a pretty small portion of what I do. It&apos;s just one many forum posters / twitter users care a lot about. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275738454111973376))<br>
What&apos;s the big portion of what you do?<br>
Future planning, UI, and then just pure people management take the biggest portion. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275765732439126016))<br>
For UI, do you work on the backend of making things work, user end experience, or something else?<br>
I design UI from the PoV of features and goals. We have actual graphic designers also and then engineers to hook it all up. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275771943557419008))<br>
Do you sometimes feel that WoW&apos;s UI is getting over-complicated? I often can&apos;t find stuff after 7 years...<br>
Yes, I do. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275981711358193667))<br>
