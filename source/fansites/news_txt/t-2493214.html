No one is immune from death&#x2014;no one except the people of Mechagon. At least, that&#x2019;s what the stories say. Most gnomes think Mechagon is just a far-fetched legend, but not the old, scarred explorer Kervo. After years of obsessive research, he has set off on what might be his final adventure: a daring gambit to find Mechagon and uncover the secrets of immortality before his own time runs out. <br>
