Last Resort (http://www.lrguild.org) killed Vashj and confirmed that the fight is now debugged and therefore easier. They also looted new druid shoulders, you can see the loots here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/may/lr_vashj.jpg). (T5 Tokens, vials, and Nether Vortex aren&apos;t included)<br>
<br>
Update 19:00<br>
Three more loots, first one are gloves from Al&apos;ar, 2nd one is a plan from Fathom-Lord Karathress, and the last one is another plan from Serpentshrine Trash. Also added a screen of the quest to kill Winterchill if some of you are interested. Thanks to Last Resort (http://www.lrguild.org) again.<br>
Actually, it seems that the gloves were droppable before the 2.1.0, they&apos;re just not listed anywhere for the moment. Thanks to Dawme from Unskilled (http://www.unskilled.fr/) for the info.<br>

Black Temple Attunement<br>
You&apos;ve got to kill the first boss of Hyjal Summit (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/may/6890BT_pre.jpg) once you killed Al&apos;ar, not really a big surprise.<br>
<br>
Instance changes<br>
A few bosses has been changed, most noticeable change is on The Lurker Below who has been buffed a bit (but still killable with the proper strategy). Gruul&apos;s Hurtful Strike has been changed (don&apos;t know if it&apos;s a bug) and Krosh Firehand is having trouble casting his fire shield at the beginning of the fight, but eventually cast it (This will be hotfixed).<br>
And the most important ... [Nether Vortex] droprate has been increased GREATLY and now drops easily from trash in Serpentshrine Cavern and Tempest Keep.<br>
<br>
New loots<br>
A lot of loots added to Heroic Instances, and even to some raid bosses. You should watch Wowhead latest additions (http://www.wowhead.com/?latest=additions) page closely.<br>

<br>
New patterns<br>
Increased [Nether Vortex] drop means more patterns ... a lot more actually. Here is a first look at what guilds have dropped already. (Thanks to For The Horde (http://www.for-the-horde.de) and Last Resort (http://www.lrguild.org))<br>

Netherwing<br>
A reader sent me additional informations about the Netherwing Guide (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=120), thanks to him !<br>
<br>
Just a little more info to add to your guide, the Netherwing Crystals also drop from the Netherwing Rays outside of the mines on the regular surface of the Netherwing Ledge. Seemed to be an average drop rate, took about 2 hours farming last night to get about 41 crystals and 87 dust. They also drop Motes of Mana at an incredible rate (like the other Rays) and as such, I would expect the price of Primal Mana to drop. I had 5 primals by the time I finished last night.</div></div>
