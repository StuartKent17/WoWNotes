chaud2019-04-16, 07:55 PMRise of Azshara PTR Development Notes – April 16
We’re deploying our first build for the upcoming content update—Rise of Azshara—to our Public Test Realms. It is now testable. Here’s an outline of what’s coming in this PTR.

Now Available for Testing

Heart of Azeroth system update: introducing Essences
New Zone: Mechagon
New Arena: The Robodrome
Mount Equipment
Crestfall and Snowblossom Island Expeditions
Ashran Epic Battleground


Our initial testing will be primarily technical, so some Rise of Azshara features will be locked/unavailable for the first few days while we work on initial concerns with the above content. Please note that Ashran may not easily complete a queue in the PTR.


Coming Soon

Heroic Battle for Stromgarde
New Missions
New Zone: Nazjatar

Explore the new zone including quest lines, World Quests, and World PvP Events focused on strengthening alliances with the new aquatic races

Heritage Armors
New Profession Recipes
New Raid-- Azshara’s Eternal Palace

As always, we’ll coordinate the testing of this new raid’s encounters via scheduled announcements.

New Dungeon-- Operation: Mechagon
Pet Battle Dungeon: Stratholme
Direhorn Training quests
Updates to Brewfest



We plan to do a wipe of all characters in a few weeks after getting focused feedback on the Heart of Azeroth Essences. This will allow us to test the feel and pacing of obtaining them all naturally. We’ll give you a heads up on that character wipe here in this forum.

Get into the PTR!
The PTR is now available. To log in to the PTR, simply create a PTR account and copy the character you wish to test from your account. Step-by-step directions can be found here.

Note : World of Warcraft PTR realms are only available to players who have a full World of Warcraft account.
