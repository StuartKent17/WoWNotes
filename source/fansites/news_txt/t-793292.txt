Good thread, Sammew. Aside from content, also included in the upcoming patch are several class balance changes and bug fixes. Due to several talent revisions for select classes, druids, paladins, priests, and shaman will have their talent trees reset.

Experience required to gain levels 71 through 80 is being reduced by 20%.

You'll also get the Cataclysm introductory cinematic and new login screen.

Stood in the Fire  Feat of Strength
It'll be virtually impossible to predict when and where he'll show up. Deathwing does what he wants. Waiting in a random zone for him to show up is not going to be very effective. It could literally take days for him to hit the zone you're in. Source

Onyxian Whelpling
It was a pet rewarded to any characters that logged on during the 5th year anniversary. While some special pets are account-wide and mailed on new character creation, the Onyxian Whelpling was not one of them. Source 

Loremaster in Cataclysm
We hope to release more details about Loremaster tomorrow. Stay tuned! Source

Horn of Winter
The behavior you're describing is the result of a bug which will be fixed in the next patch prior to the release of Cataclysm. You will again be able to toot your own horn to gain runic power, you just won't get the Attack Power benefit if a similar buff is already present. Source
