While Mists of Pandaria already comes packed full of some of the most diverse and expansive World of Warcraft content to date, we&#x2019;re staying true to our goal of delivering new content faster. With that in mind, we&#x2019;re pleased to share that the first major Mists of Pandaria content update, Patch 5.1, is well underway.<br>
In fact, our plan is to release a build of patch 5.1 on the Public Test Realms soon so you can experience it for yourself! Initially, the PTR build won&#x2019;t include all of the 5.1 patch content, but here&#x2019;s a glimpse of the major features that are already in the pipeline.<br>

New daily quest hubs and faction reputations will be available to adventurers eager to do their part in the brewing conflict.<br>

The first rule of brawls is you don&#x2019;t talk about brawls. The second rule&#x2026;<br>

The Quest Continues<br>
Wrathion is keenly interested in the conflict exploding between the factions on Pandaria&#x2019;s southern shore. He&#x2019;s sure to have additional tasks for players to complete as they continue their quest for Legendary gear.<br>
