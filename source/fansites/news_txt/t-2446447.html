Immersive Sounds of Azeroth Panel<br>
Near the end of the panel, the team mentioned that &quot;Lady Waycrest has offered tribute and is waiting for you to find a little musical surprise.&quot; This is a possible hint to a secret in game.<br>
<br>
<br>
The panel started out with David Arkenstone and a band playing Kul Tiran music.<br>
Music often provides emotional guideposts in a story and can act as an anchor in a story arc.<br>
David Rovin took over as sound supervisor for WoW a year ago. He says WoW has been a legend in the industry for some time.<br>
Sound design should:<br>
<br>
Make the player feel awesome by having their sounds be the loudest.<br>
Help the player play the game by having audio cues such as aggro sounds.<br>
Be immersive.<br>
<br>
Audio on screen that is not directly in front of you is lowered to help you focus on what is right there in front of you.<br>
Drustvar is a good example of sound design as work in game.<br>
David Rovin leads a team of 6 sound designers for WoW.<br>
Building an Ambience in 2004<br>
<br>
Avoid sounds that create a noticeable loop.<br>
Minimize disc space through sharing.<br>
<br>
WoW Ambience Today<br>
<br>
Simplified base layer.<br>
Variation through one-shot randomization.<br>
Content specific sounds.<br>
More personality.<br>
<br>
Drustvar purposely has some spooky sounds that are tied to the effigies in the trees.<br>
Every creature has an aggro sound, attack sounds, and a death sound.<br>
The team also adds creature ambient sounds to make them more alive.<br>
<br>
Idle vocalizations<br>
Iconic performance<br>
Distant flavor kits<br>
Weighs as much as a duck<br>
<br>
Drustvar witch drust magic purposely has its own sound effects that differ from player magic sounds.<br>
Certain areas in Drustvar purposely have different sounds, most of which are even creepier than the rest of the zone, such as the graveyard and throughout the Crimson Forest.<br>
Music has a similar role as sound design in setting up a narrative or tone of a zone.<br>
Abby Lewis Inspired Music of Drustvar.<br>
<br>
Child-like and mysterious.<br>
Classic horror, not jump scare.<br>
A sense of history, twisted fairy tale.<br>
Starting point, leaving room to develop.<br>
<br>
Fallhaven - Tension Builder<br>
<br>
Darker as you start to encounter bad things.<br>
Drawing on orchestra techniques to sell tension.<br>
<br>
Glenbrook Wood<br>
<br>
Strong melody introduced early.<br>
Reinforced though question experience leading to dungeon capper and central piece of the zone, Waycrest Manor.<br>
<br>
Waycrest Manor<br>
<br>
The pipe organ was used outside Waycrest Manor and the music becomes more muted.<br>
Inside, the music is stronger.<br>
Waycrest Manor was the most intense sound design that the team has ever created in WoW.<br>
The organ becomes a character in itself.<br>
It was interesting creating sound for a boss that had an actual organ involved in the fight.<br>
When you kill a witch in the dungeon, you can actually hear the music play a cord that sounds as if Lady Waycrest is slamming her hands on the keys in anger.<br>
Encounter logic for creature spawning is utilized in changing the music as well.<br>
Dynamic Boss Encounter<br>
<br>
Paying It All Off<br>
<br>
Music changes by phase<br>
Organ based spells<br>
Final visit to musical themes<br>
When Lady Waycrest joins the fight, the emitters turn off and the dungeon music raises. When she dies, the music ends for the dungeon.<br>
<br>
<br>
Diegetic Audio<br>
<br>
From &quot;wallpaper music&quot; to emanating in the world.<br>
Responsive to players&apos; actions.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lady Waycrest has offered tribute and is waiting for you to find a little musical surprise.&quot; Possible hint at secret in game?<br>
There are some immersive sound changes coming to when you are mounted or on a flight path.<br>
