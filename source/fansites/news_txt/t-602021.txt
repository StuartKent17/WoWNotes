US Support delays
Answers to GM Tickets might be a bit slow today for US players.
On Sunday, September 9, we expect possible support delays between 6:00 AM PDT and 6:00 PM PDT due to some planned local area power maintenance. Players that submit GM tickets can expect slightly longer wait times during this time. This maintenance will not affect normal gameplay. We appreciate your patience during this time. 


Comics
Today we've got a comic from Manic Graffiti  and another one from the official site. It seems that this one is a bit buggy, if you don't get the voidwalker comic I mirrored it here 


   


Website
Guild recruitment forums are now available on the left menu. I didn't post rules in the first place but it would be nice to not have excessive bumping or double posting on recruitment posts. Now you're warned, I can delete posts !
