Patch 6.0.2 Class Balance
Hunters, we're not ignoring you, or satisfied with the current situation. New data helps us find the issue. We just need to work through the discrepancies, and find out what is disguising the issue on our side. Maybe we assume this is obvious, but it'll help to hear: The goal is equality. We'll continue working toward that goal. Obviously, we are not there yet. Nor do we expect to get there at 90 but will get closer. We *do* expect to get there at 100.

I hope you do the same for all classes.
We are. Hunters are just at the top of our list right now.


Blasted Lands Quest Rewards
If you were eager to do the Blasted Lands event quests, you may have completed them before rewards were hotfixed in. The quests are now correctly rewarding item level 520 trinkets. If you actually need the trinket and did the quest early on, you may have to wait for a fix:

I don't have a specific update, but the potential resolution will be one available to all those affected and not something that we'd "fix" on an individual level.

Developmental implementation can take a little time though so it will likely be a few days before they can create, test and implement their resolution. I'll provide any updates I am able to pass along.

Group Finder
Several players have expressed concerns http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14882078357?page=1 about the new Group Finder, such as the 25 visible groups cap and timers on different things. 
When we design our default UI elements we follow some core design philosophies to ensure we have a consistent, approachable, unobtrusive, and easy-to-use interface. And, also like most default UI elements, the Premade Groups tool is fully moddable. We'd fully expect that, much like unit frames, raid frames, etc., that those who are looking for different layouts and additional functionality will turn to creating and using addons. Which is of course largely the point and focus of addon support--allowing people to gain additional customization and functionality beyond what the default UI might offer. Quite a few players prefer that additional functionality and customization, and that's awesome, that's what makes addons great. But it is early still, the patch hasn't been out long, and mods tend to spring from a personal or collective desire for specific functionality or customization. Maybe you can help inspire an addon author?

That said, we're still definitely looking for feedback on what changes or features people want to see made to the default UI in future updates, and any constructive feedback on layout improvements or changes are more than welcome. In this case the UI and Macro forum http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/1011693/ is probably the best place to help consolidate feedback.


Patch 6.0.2 Stat Squish and Leveling Concerns
We have a hotfix in testing that will adjust creature scaling to better account for the stat squish.

To elaborate a bit, this isn't just about the stat squish. That was actually a relatively straightforward process numerically. But we made three separate changes that all affected the pacing and danger level of legacy content throughout the game:

The "stat squish" wherein items from level 60 through Mists of Pandaria dungeon gear were changed to use a linear instead of an exponential scale. Doubling player health, enabling us to remove resilience from PvP and also make damage and healing less "spiky" in general. Removing base points from spells to allow for better scaling and tuning across classes - previously a Frostbolt might have done X damage plus Y% of your spell power; now, in 6.0.2, it just does Z% of your spell power.

Any tuning issues that are being seen, particularly in level-up content especially dungeons, aren't a result of the squish alone but rather the combination of all three changes. We've been following data and feedback closely, and are testing internally the change that Lore mentioned, which should hopefully be deployed within a day or so it will require server restarts. In the meantime, if there are particular creature abilities that you encounter that seem disproportionately deadly, it's quite helpful to keep pointing those out.


Blue Posts
Damage in PvP
We've just applied a hotfix that will reduce pvp damage by 25%. Once the expansion launches, it will be reverted, but it should make skirmishes a bit more palatable in the meantime.

Battleground Queues
Correct, we'll unfortunately need to restart realms in order for the fix to apply. Restarts are scheduled for early tomorrow morning in the North American region.

Mythic/Warforged Items Downgrading to Normal
Don't have any information to share at this time but letting you know that we're currently investigating the issue. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344817-mythic-warforged-item-becomes-normal-version/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14880818443?page=1#9

Blasted Lands Rewards Availability Duration
Yep, the Iron Starlette pet and Iron Vanguard title are only available until Warlords launches on November 13th. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344793-iron-starlette-question/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14882118463?page=1#2

Loot Based Lockouts
The loot-based lockouts should be in place on Normal or Heroic for Siege of Orgrimmar, and should work a lot like Flex partial clears did in 5.4: based on the leader's lockout, with bosses despawned from the start until reaching the first one the leader hasn't killed so, e.g. if a leader has done Immerseus and Norushen but somehow was not saved to Protectors, their instance would begin with Immerseus dead, but Protectors and Norushen still alive.

More or less, you should be able to pick up where you left off in Normal or Heroic, and if you enter a different instance where a boss you've already killed still lives, you can help out but you won't get loot.

From the above, it sounds like there may be some bugs here. It's a complex system, and a big part of why we converted Siege of Orgrimmar to use the new system in 6.0 was to make entirely certain that we work out any glitches before Draenor raids commence. We'll look into it. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344607-60-raid-lockout-question-starting-boss/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14728143554?page=1#9

Level 90 Boost Experience
Sorry about any confusion! When Warlords of Draenor releases boosted characters will have their abilities introduced a few at a time as they quest through the intro Draenor experience. Until then we've made the new Iron Tide invasion event an accelerated version of the same process. If you're on a boosted character you'll want to begin the Blasted Lands questline that pops up when you first log in, and your abilities will unlock as you go.

We recently updated the patch notes with that information.

Boosted Characters

Newly Boosted Characters now start on the front lines in the Blasted Lands, doing whatever they can to stop the Iron Horde pouring out of The Dark Portal and start with a basic set of spells and abilities for their class. Characters unlock the rest of their spells and abilities by advancing through the Iron Horde Incursion world event in the Blasted Lands.

General statement: we do not have any plans for any more toybox changes until we see how things shake out over the next few months. Anything with a player or NPC interaction, teleport, movement buff, or a quest item was intentionally not included. It is one thing for a character to have earned those items at the intended level, but giving them to every character may not be appropriate.

Is the bug that Assendance was not resetting after killing a boss all other CDs do fixed for 6.0? If not, will it be for WoD?
Only cooldowns greater than 3 minutes reset at the end of raid encounter attempts, so that isn't a bug. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/519507441789452288

PvP
can you confirm, in WoD RBGS award same amount of Conquest as arena rating?

yes holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/519687174338265089

oh, huh? So on busy servers we can expect queue times? I expect similar but opposite servers like KT and MG to merge?

Quick Q: is Ashran going work like TB/WG in that only ~equal amounts of players from each faction can be in it? #WoW
No. Ashran queuing is basically a bouncer. We let everyone in until we're at capacity for the server. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/520048487665106945

with Ashran servers being grouped for faction balance, are they still being matched within CRZ groups, or was that idea discarded?

Lore
...deal with that through Thrall, but now HE'S fucking back, yet we're losing Khadgar, and I assume the Kirin Tor again
How are you losing him? He's more active than he's ever been in WoW. Everyone benefits from his presence. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519508479870898177

did the FOTR only react? did King Arthur? villains create drama, but they don't have to be everything.
Gandalf is reacting to Sauron. You know this because there's a lot of time for the details to unfold. Not a luxury games have. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519523517985865728
We want to put up a big enemy and give you reasons to fight them, we make you want to go on the adventure and take them down. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519523744708960256
Villains aren't "everything" but you need a strong, clear conflict for players to resolve. Otherwise it's not compelling. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519523924980158465

Tradition is no excuse. Break tradition, create heroes that are proactive - reactive heroes seem less intelligent.
What would a "proactive" hero do? What conflict would they solve? Who created the conflict? Genuinely curious. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519507475519643649
proactive heroes strike first against, even seek out, evil and injustice. Batman chillin until signaled vs. out patrolling Gotham
We do that all the time in quests. It's also pretty much the definition of a raid. We do it constantly. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519513411290292225
I get what you're saying; it's in the details. Evil is out there and we're going to go stop it. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519513204628533248
At a high level, he's still reacting to crime. Someone is still creating conflict which he has to resolve. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519512909764767744
As a player I feel proactive constantly. In the past the majority of faction heroes felt static/reactive unlike in the RTS games.
That is fair, but you were also playing as those characters on their journeys. You had enough time with Arthas to care. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519529653258551296

also, Garrosh's goals have been the Horde's goals for half the lifetime of this game...
Horde is divided, even players are split between Garrosh's goals of conquest and Thrall's goals of peace. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519557609364267009

When's next time you see Alliance as having a "bad guy"? All Alliance "buy guys" have been "corrupted" somehow Illidan, Arthas
That's a good question. We don't have any in the works right now, but I think we're overdue for an Alliance villain. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519562175019376640

Horde have explicit goals and the story serves those goals. can you honestly say the alliance does also beyond "hold the line"?
What do you perceive to be the Horde's explicit goals? I think you're falsely bundling all Horde up with Garrosh. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519551014441975809
to blur the line between them. Not that it's fair just understandable how it can happen.
Yeah, conquest is an easy goal to push. What kind of large-scale goal could Alliance undertake? Perhaps reclamation. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519577934667849728
Or maybe they're simply the first to discover and begin attacking a new threat. Definitely opportunities. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519578043975618562

Khadgar has always been my favorite character, however now you've turned him into a traitor to the Alliance. Are you proud?
How is he a traitor? Because he doesn't kill Horde on sight? By that logic, all faction leaders are "traitors." Disagree. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519506785590181889
… Please answer me, why this difference between Khadgar and Thrall? Any difference besides they belong to different factions?
Thrall isn't truly neutral, either. He's Horde, but he can set differences aside to work with Ally when needed. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519578198061744128
Jaina behaved similarly before her city was nuked. Anduin and Varian can do it as well. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519578279297024000

The story makes it seem like the Alliance only raids Orgrimmar BECAUSE of the Rebellion. Otherwise no. They've always been concerned with other things. It beggars belief, sometimes.
Thing is, Horde story is largely concerned with bigger things, too/ There's always a bigger threat than each other. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519669594357657601
Or like Ashenvale: the Alliance was off fighting Old Gods and only taking minimal action against the Horde until the end.
Alliance move into the Barrens and torch Camp Taurajo, one of my favorite old quest hubs. We can go back and forth all day. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519671021377306625
For what it's worth, I recall being f'ing terrified of night elves in Ashenvale. Really felt like enemy territory. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519675090024140802
But, I mean, is this valuable feedback? How can we make our concerns better known or clearer?
It's all valuable. Specific examples and concerns help a lot more than broad assertions like "never" and "always." _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519672078908137473
I think we've drifted too far into stereotypes of "grr aggressive bloodthirsty orc" vs. "ye olde stoic knight defender." _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519672398748987393
I understand the overall desire is to show more proactive heroism from the Alliance. Give them some teeth. I agree. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519672231870201856
For what it's worth, those themes work well on a broad scale. They are a good backdrop. We aim for variety in the details. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519672647169232896

Is there any chance you guys might change Garrosh's fate? He's become a fairly interesting character, lots of room for growth
Pretty unlikely. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519899440337805313

where are they in the game? Lorewise there may be a lot of casualties but we dont see them in game
Probably didn't stand out to Alliance players, but as Horde it was really grim. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/520242037161861121
Also a lot of the trash in SoO are literally Orgrimmar NPCs. The corpses strung about are old trainers, vendors, etc. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/520241968874393600

True. Does this mean that the Horde are villains? That's a problem. Too many mixed messages.
No, but Garrosh certainly became one. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/520241437514801152
so if the Alliance are heroes, and heroes react, what does that make the Horde?
Does that make the Alliance villains? No, it's a conflict the player characters would likely want to solve. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/520242724440522752
Imagine Varian suddenly decides humans are the supreme race, drums up an army, and begins executing dwarves and gnomes. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/520242575127494656
Horde are heroes as well. You're lumping all of the Horde in with Garrosh, who raised an evil regime from within the Horde. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/520242263696232448
You said the Ally, as heroes, generally react. Not saying Horde are villains, but it seems devs think they're more interesting.
I mean all heroes, in general, react to some conflict or situation. Horde players, too. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/520243871851102210

what is the plan for lvl 100 content. Lvl 100 seems rather barren barring the daily, ashran, and the gear up.
Quest-wise, we have new quest lines coming out of the garrison every week at max level, as well as a legendary quest. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519511528920203264
Beyond that, you have just as much or more as any other expac: dungeon, raid, outdoor max-level areas, world bosses, etc. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519511704875442176

Do ya think garrison mine & garden for all make prof mats quite unbalanced against leather? Wtb slot-free skin hut 
The barn provides a lot of leather, there are fewer herb/mine nodes in the world but many skinnable creatures Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/519914088944922624

Garrisons
is there still going to be a pass on follower traits vs. mission reqs? Timed Battle lights my list up like Xmas tree others NSM
Start a new toon, I don't think old data was updated, should be done as of next beta build, good trait/ability spread, LFFeeback Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/519666574194520064

Revisiting your tweet from 7 months ago. What was done to make garrisons alt-friendly? Beyond lvl3 plans, any shared progress?
That, plus work orders than can be queued, are the main features. We'll be monitoring feedback as the expac goes on. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/520308033847853058

Garrison question: Are there enough of a specific race to have only them as followers i.e. a Garrison with nothing but Gnomes?
The Inn has a lot of each race, I want to say something like 15-20, should get you there, and 'rax can set your guards' race Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/520338166008807424
