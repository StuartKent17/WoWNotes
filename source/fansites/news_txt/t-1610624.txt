Patch 6.0.2 Class Balance
Hunters, we're not ignoring you, or satisfied with the current situation. New data helps us find the issue. We just need to work through the discrepancies, and find out what is disguising the issue on our side. Maybe we assume this is obvious, but it'll help to hear: The goal is equality. We'll continue working toward that goal. Obviously, we are not there yet. Nor do we expect to get there at 90 but will get closer. We *do* expect to get there at 100.

I hope you do the same for all classes.
We are. Hunters are just at the top of our list right now.


Blasted Lands Quest Rewards
If you were eager to do the Blasted Lands event quests, you may have completed them before rewards were hotfixed in. The quests are now correctly rewarding item level 520 trinkets. If you actually need the trinket and did the quest early on, you may have to wait for a fix:

I don't have a specific update, but the potential resolution will be one available to all those affected and not something that we'd "fix" on an individual level.

Developmental implementation can take a little time though so it will likely be a few days before they can create, test and implement their resolution. I'll provide any updates I am able to pass along.

Group Finder
Several players have expressed concerns  about the new Group Finder, such as the 25 visible groups cap and timers on different things. 
When we design our default UI elements we follow some core design philosophies to ensure we have a consistent, approachable, unobtrusive, and easy-to-use interface. And, also like most default UI elements, the Premade Groups tool is fully moddable. We'd fully expect that, much like unit frames, raid frames, etc., that those who are looking for different layouts and additional functionality will turn to creating and using addons. Which is of course largely the point and focus of addon support--allowing people to gain additional customization and functionality beyond what the default UI might offer. Quite a few players prefer that additional functionality and customization, and that's awesome, that's what makes addons great. But it is early still, the patch hasn't been out long, and mods tend to spring from a personal or collective desire for specific functionality or customization. Maybe you can help inspire an addon author?

That said, we're still definitely looking for feedback on what changes or features people want to see made to the default UI in future updates, and any constructive feedback on layout improvements or changes are more than welcome. In this case the UI and Macro forum  is probably the best place to help consolidate feedback.


Patch 6.0.2 Stat Squish and Leveling Concerns
We have a hotfix in testing that will adjust creature scaling to better account for the stat squish.

To elaborate a bit, this isn't just about the stat squish. That was actually a relatively straightforward process numerically. But we made three separate changes that all affected the pacing and danger level of legacy content throughout the game:

The "stat squish" wherein items from level 60 through Mists of Pandaria dungeon gear were changed to use a linear instead of an exponential scale. Doubling player health, enabling us to remove resilience from PvP and also make damage and healing less "spiky" in general. Removing base points from spells to allow for better scaling and tuning across classes - previously a Frostbolt might have done X damage plus Y% of your spell power; now, in 6.0.2, it just does Z% of your spell power.

Any tuning issues that are being seen, particularly in level-up content especially dungeons, aren't a result of the squish alone but rather the combination of all three changes. We've been following data and feedback closely, and are testing internally the change that Lore mentioned, which should hopefully be deployed within a day or so it will require server restarts. In the meantime, if there are particular creature abilities that you encounter that seem disproportionately deadly, it's quite helpful to keep pointing those out.


Blue Posts
Damage in PvP
We've just applied a hotfix that will reduce pvp damage by 25%. Once the expansion launches, it will be reverted, but it should make skirmishes a bit more palatable in the meantime. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Battleground Queues
Correct, we'll unfortunately need to restart realms in order for the fix to apply. Restarts are scheduled for early tomorrow morning in the North American region. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Mythic/Warforged Items Downgrading to Normal
Don't have any information to share at this time but letting you know that we're currently investigating the issue. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Blasted Lands Rewards Availability Duration
Yep, the Iron Starlette pet and Iron Vanguard title are only available until Warlords launches on November 13th. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Loot Based Lockouts
The loot-based lockouts should be in place on Normal or Heroic for Siege of Orgrimmar, and should work a lot like Flex partial clears did in 5.4: based on the leader's lockout, with bosses despawned from the start until reaching the first one the leader hasn't killed so, e.g. if a leader has done Immerseus and Norushen but somehow was not saved to Protectors, their instance would begin with Immerseus dead, but Protectors and Norushen still alive.

More or less, you should be able to pick up where you left off in Normal or Heroic, and if you enter a different instance where a boss you've already killed still lives, you can help out but you won't get loot.

From the above, it sounds like there may be some bugs here. It's a complex system, and a big part of why we converted Siege of Orgrimmar to use the new system in 6.0 was to make entirely certain that we work out any glitches before Draenor raids commence. We'll look into it. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Level 90 Boost Experience
Sorry about any confusion! When Warlords of Draenor releases boosted characters will have their abilities introduced a few at a time as they quest through the intro Draenor experience. Until then we've made the new Iron Tide invasion event an accelerated version of the same process. If you're on a boosted character you'll want to begin the Blasted Lands questline that pops up when you first log in, and your abilities will unlock as you go.

We recently updated the patch notes with that information.

Boosted Characters

Newly Boosted Characters now start on the front lines in the Blasted Lands, doing whatever they can to stop the Iron Horde pouring out of The Dark Portal and start with a basic set of spells and abilities for their class. Characters unlock the rest of their spells and abilities by advancing through the Iron Horde Incursion world event in the Blasted Lands. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 


Blue Tweets
Racials
after undead racial nerfed. it was promised to nerf human racial... the question was in wich way... we saw nothin till now...
It was not promised. We never promise. We sometimes share our thoughts about what we're considering. No promises were made. holinka 

Classes
 Druid Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Any plans to change cyclone range back to 30 yards? Would be a huge QOL change.
That is not a QoL change, that is a buff. holinka 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
how come monks get no love forMinor glyphs we got the least transmog choices & no cosmetic stuff
As a new class, many of the "hey that sounds cool!" ideas were baked in from the start Muffinus 

Character / Items
Will horde players keep the azeroth choppers mount should they transfer to alliance after the deadline to obtain the mount?
All horde characters get the mount for any account that logs in during the prescribed period. holinka 

General statement: we do not have any plans for any more toybox changes until we see how things shake out over the next few months. Anything with a player or NPC interaction, teleport, movement buff, or a quest item was intentionally not included. It is one thing for a character to have earned those items at the intended level, but giving them to every character may not be appropriate. Source 

PvE
Is the bug that Assendance was not resetting after killing a boss all other CDs do fixed for 6.0? If not, will it be for WoD?
Only cooldowns greater than 3 minutes reset at the end of raid encounter attempts, so that isn't a bug. WatcherDev 

PvP
can you confirm, in WoD RBGS award same amount of Conquest as arena rating?
In Warlords, your cap is based on your highest rating, whether it's arenas or RBGs. RBGs do provide an extra chance at gear tough. holinka 

can real id friends group queue for Ashran?
yes holinka 

oh, huh? So on busy servers we can expect queue times? I expect similar but opposite servers like KT and MG to merge?
the focus is having both sides full, not making sure both sides have equal queue times. holinka 

You mentioned in an interview Mythic gear will get reduced ilvl in PvP Combat. Waht ilvl will it be? What about Legendary effects?
690 and PvE set bonuses don't work holinka 

Quick Q: is Ashran going work like TB/WG in that only ~equal amounts of players from each faction can be in it? #WoW
No. Ashran queuing is basically a bouncer. We let everyone in until we're at capacity for the server. holinka 

with Ashran servers being grouped for faction balance, are they still being matched within CRZ groups, or was that idea discarded?
We'll try to match them up in the same data centers as much as possible. holinka 

Lore
...deal with that through Thrall, but now HE'S fucking back, yet we're losing Khadgar, and I assume the Kirin Tor again
How are you losing him? He's more active than he's ever been in WoW. Everyone benefits from his presence. _DonAdams 

did the FOTR only react? did King Arthur? villains create drama, but they don't have to be everything.
Gandalf is reacting to Sauron. You know this because there's a lot of time for the details to unfold. Not a luxury games have. _DonAdams 
We want to put up a big enemy and give you reasons to fight them, we make you want to go on the adventure and take them down. _DonAdams 
Villains aren't "everything" but you need a strong, clear conflict for players to resolve. Otherwise it's not compelling. _DonAdams 

Tradition is no excuse. Break tradition, create heroes that are proactive - reactive heroes seem less intelligent.
What would a "proactive" hero do? What conflict would they solve? Who created the conflict? Genuinely curious. _DonAdams 
proactive heroes strike first against, even seek out, evil and injustice. Batman chillin until signaled vs. out patrolling Gotham
We do that all the time in quests. It's also pretty much the definition of a raid. We do it constantly. _DonAdams 
I get what you're saying; it's in the details. Evil is out there and we're going to go stop it. _DonAdams 
At a high level, he's still reacting to crime. Someone is still creating conflict which he has to resolve. _DonAdams 
As a player I feel proactive constantly. In the past the majority of faction heroes felt static/reactive unlike in the RTS games.
That is fair, but you were also playing as those characters on their journeys. You had enough time with Arthas to care. _DonAdams 

also, Garrosh's goals have been the Horde's goals for half the lifetime of this game...
Horde is divided, even players are split between Garrosh's goals of conquest and Thrall's goals of peace. _DonAdams 

When's next time you see Alliance as having a "bad guy"? All Alliance "buy guys" have been "corrupted" somehow Illidan, Arthas
That's a good question. We don't have any in the works right now, but I think we're overdue for an Alliance villain. _DonAdams 

Horde have explicit goals and the story serves those goals. can you honestly say the alliance does also beyond "hold the line"?
What do you perceive to be the Horde's explicit goals? I think you're falsely bundling all Horde up with Garrosh. _DonAdams 
to blur the line between them. Not that it's fair just understandable how it can happen.
Yeah, conquest is an easy goal to push. What kind of large-scale goal could Alliance undertake? Perhaps reclamation. _DonAdams 
Or maybe they're simply the first to discover and begin attacking a new threat. Definitely opportunities. _DonAdams 

Khadgar has always been my favorite character, however now you've turned him into a traitor to the Alliance. Are you proud?
How is he a traitor? Because he doesn't kill Horde on sight? By that logic, all faction leaders are "traitors." Disagree. _DonAdams 
… Please answer me, why this difference between Khadgar and Thrall? Any difference besides they belong to different factions?
Thrall isn't truly neutral, either. He's Horde, but he can set differences aside to work with Ally when needed. _DonAdams 
Jaina behaved similarly before her city was nuked. Anduin and Varian can do it as well. _DonAdams 

The story makes it seem like the Alliance only raids Orgrimmar BECAUSE of the Rebellion. Otherwise no. They've always been concerned with other things. It beggars belief, sometimes.
Thing is, Horde story is largely concerned with bigger things, too/ There's always a bigger threat than each other. _DonAdams 
Or like Ashenvale: the Alliance was off fighting Old Gods and only taking minimal action against the Horde until the end.
Alliance move into the Barrens and torch Camp Taurajo, one of my favorite old quest hubs. We can go back and forth all day. _DonAdams 
For what it's worth, I recall being f'ing terrified of night elves in Ashenvale. Really felt like enemy territory. _DonAdams 
But, I mean, is this valuable feedback? How can we make our concerns better known or clearer?
It's all valuable. Specific examples and concerns help a lot more than broad assertions like "never" and "always." _DonAdams 
I think we've drifted too far into stereotypes of "grr aggressive bloodthirsty orc" vs. "ye olde stoic knight defender." _DonAdams 
I understand the overall desire is to show more proactive heroism from the Alliance. Give them some teeth. I agree. _DonAdams 
For what it's worth, those themes work well on a broad scale. They are a good backdrop. We aim for variety in the details. _DonAdams 

Is there any chance you guys might change Garrosh's fate? He's become a fairly interesting character, lots of room for growth
Pretty unlikely. _DonAdams 

where are they in the game? Lorewise there may be a lot of casualties but we dont see them in game
Probably didn't stand out to Alliance players, but as Horde it was really grim. _DonAdams 
Also a lot of the trash in SoO are literally Orgrimmar NPCs. The corpses strung about are old trainers, vendors, etc. _DonAdams 

True. Does this mean that the Horde are villains? That's a problem. Too many mixed messages.
No, but Garrosh certainly became one. _DonAdams 
so if the Alliance are heroes, and heroes react, what does that make the Horde?
Does that make the Alliance villains? No, it's a conflict the player characters would likely want to solve. _DonAdams 
Imagine Varian suddenly decides humans are the supreme race, drums up an army, and begins executing dwarves and gnomes. _DonAdams 
Horde are heroes as well. You're lumping all of the Horde in with Garrosh, who raised an evil regime from within the Horde. _DonAdams 
You said the Ally, as heroes, generally react. Not saying Horde are villains, but it seems devs think they're more interesting.
I mean all heroes, in general, react to some conflict or situation. Horde players, too. _DonAdams 

Reputation / Questing
what is the plan for lvl 100 content. Lvl 100 seems rather barren barring the daily, ashran, and the gear up.
Quest-wise, we have new quest lines coming out of the garrison every week at max level, as well as a legendary quest. _DonAdams 
Beyond that, you have just as much or more as any other expac: dungeon, raid, outdoor max-level areas, world bosses, etc. _DonAdams 

Do ya think garrison mine & garden for all make prof mats quite unbalanced against leather? Wtb slot-free skin hut 
The barn provides a lot of leather, there are fewer herb/mine nodes in the world but many skinnable creatures Muffinus 

Garrisons
is there still going to be a pass on follower traits vs. mission reqs? Timed Battle lights my list up like Xmas tree others NSM
Start a new toon, I don't think old data was updated, should be done as of next beta build, good trait/ability spread, LFFeeback Muffinus 

Revisiting your tweet from 7 months ago. What was done to make garrisons alt-friendly? Beyond lvl3 plans, any shared progress?
That, plus work orders than can be queued, are the main features. We'll be monitoring feedback as the expac goes on. Muffinus 

Garrison question: Are there enough of a specific race to have only them as followers i.e. a Garrison with nothing but Gnomes?
The Inn has a lot of each race, I want to say something like 15-20, should get you there, and 'rax can set your guards' race Muffinus
