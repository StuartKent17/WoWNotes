Increasing Island Expedition Rewards
Island Expedition bonus rewards https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7852-Island-Expeditions-Guide-Battle-for-Azeroth will be increased in a hotfix.
Thank you all for your feedback on Island Expeditions. We’ve been monitoring the rate of rewards from Islands so far, and while we believe we hit the mark with the Azerite rewards, we’re not happy with the drop rates for the various bonus rewards such as transmog items, pets, quest starters, etc.

We’re currently working on a hotfix that will substantially increase the rate of these rewards. Once it’s live, you should start to see more of these items dropping for you and your group members on future Island Expeditions. While we don’t have a firm timeframe for this hotfix, we’re hoping to push it out later today.

Again, thank you for your constructive feedback, and we look forward to seeing you on more Island Expeditions!
