Apparently, a few people are interested in that &quot;Cataclysm&quot; thing and I guess it&apos;s time for an update of what&apos;s going on.<br>
<br>
The Alpha is protected by a Non-disclosure agreement (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement), which basically means that anything I could post could get me sued. I&apos;m not saying it will happen, Blizzard has been fairly forgiving with everything posted on the site in this past but I think you will understand that I cannot just post everything I find without checking a few things first. <br>
<br>
For the moment, Alpha related posts on the forums aren&apos;t moderated (it would be stupid to think we can moderate all the posts about it) but people trying to scam or spread false rumors will be rewarded with a 3 months ban from the forums. Anyone linking or advertising emulation/cheating sites will be permanently banned from the forums. <br>
<br>
And because you&apos;re all going to ask anyway, yes, the Deathwing model posted everywhere on the forums is real. <br>
