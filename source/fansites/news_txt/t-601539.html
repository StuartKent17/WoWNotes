It&apos;s a video of the song &quot;I am murloc&quot; performed by L70ETC. Check their page on WoWWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Level_60_Elite_Tauren_Chieftain) for more infos about them. <br>
<br>
&quot;Having leveled past their previous name -- Level 60 Elite Tauren Chieftain -- the crunching chords and pounding war drums of the newly dubbed Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftain will once again be echoing throughout the Anaheim Convention Center&apos;s main arena at BlizzCon 2007. Exclusive to BlizzCon attendees, the concert will start at 7:30pm on Saturday, August 4, preceding the other live entertainment that evening. Get there early because seating will be first-come, first-pwned.&quot;<br>

We might see them in game in some occasions, there is at least one of their song in game, and multiple spells (http://www.thottbot.com/?s=L70ETC) with their name. <br>
