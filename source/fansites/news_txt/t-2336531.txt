Developer Interviews
We're continuing to take a look at new information from the BlizzCon developer interviews.

Kotaku Discusses PVP with Devs
Kotaku  talked about the new PVP decisions with the WoW Devs.


The new World PVP system allows all players to experience PVP if they want.
Ion admits that the team hasn’t done a very good job in terms of World PVP and are looking to breathe new life into it with BfA.
World PVP can never be 100% fair, but the pace and combat can be worked on.
The team is looking into implementing the level scaling feature into World PVP as well.
The team doesn’t want the sense of progression to be lost in World PVP by using the PVP templates.

The Artifact Weapon sendoff will take place just before the expansion.
There are some preliminary requirements to starting the quest chains for Allied races - such as getting exalted with highmountain tauren before you can proceed.
There might be some story for the Void Elves in 7.3.5.
The alliance will get to experience an epic story involving Jaina and where she has been.
Jaina will have some family problems in the expansion.
”Sneaky Pete” is a rogue Island AI character that likes to wait until you engage mobs to attack you. He is a jerk.
The team is hoping to start beta early next year.
The goal is to have Battle for Azeroth launched in 2018.

Other examples of Island consumables could be group “thorns” or ways to bounce mobs between each other to stun lock them.
The Island AI will also hit harder than normal mobs.
Some Island scenarios, mobs and abilities may only appear on higher difficulties.
PVP Island Expeditions might not activate all of your PVP abilities.
Professions also come into play for Island Expeditions - a miner can mine Azerite nodes faster around the islands.
The emissary system might influence the way Island Expeditions are done.
The team likes the idea that you build up a bank of content to do such as emissaries and want to use it on more features.
The team likes that there will be synergy choices with the different slots of the Heart of Azeroth.
Higher item level gear’s abilities may have higher Azerite level requirements to unlock.
Warfront events, commanders and AI choices are all random.
Communities are not replacing guilds. They are simply giving players the ability to have a variety of communities in game outside of their guild.
The goal is for players to be in as many communities as they want.
End game raiding in BfA will play out much like Legion.
A lot of old pet models were updated including chickens and cats.
There is a new cat model that is fat and fuzzy.
The stat squish numbers are open to player feedback.
Battle for Azeroth includes a character boost.
