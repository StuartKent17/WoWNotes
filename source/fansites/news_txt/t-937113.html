Ragnaros<br>

Several locations which could be used to avoid damage from Engulfing Flames have been adjusted so they&#x2019;re no longer safe spots.<br>

Living Meteors will now become frozen by Cenarius under all conditions when transitioning into phase 4 on Heroic difficulty.<br>
If a Living Meteor is frozen in the lava pool during the transition into phase 4 on Heroic difficulty, it will teleport on a player after the stun ends, but will no longer explode immediately. Players now have a 2-second window to escape the meteor&#x2019;s melee range.<br>
Living Meteors will gain the Living Meteor Transform buff once frozen in the Breadth of Frost trap, even if a meteor is knocked into it.<br>
If a Living Meteor&apos;s fixated target drops aggro via Feign Death, the meteor will target the pet, and then select a new non-pet target upon which to fixate.<br>
