WoW Classic BlizzCon Demo Pre-Download<br>
Hi everyone! We&#x2019;re incredibly excited for you all to get your hands on the WoW Classic BlizzCon demo next week, and to help make things as smooth as possible, we&#x2019;re making the client available to download for Virtual Ticket holders starting today.<br>
<br>
Over the next 24 hours, we&#x2019;ll be enabling the ability to download the WoW Classic demo through the Battle.net app for players who have purchased the BlizzCon Virtual Ticket, as well as standard BlizzCon ticket holders who have added their Virtual Goodies code to their Battle.net account. If you don&#x2019;t see the option to install the demo right away, don&#x2019;t worry &#x2013; you&#x2019;ll still have plenty of time to download the client before the demo goes live during BlizzCon next week.<br>
<br>
We can&#x2019;t wait for you to get a peek at what we&#x2019;ve been working on, and hope you enjoy this preview of what&#x2019;s to come!</div></div>
