I believe it was Ion that said in a dev chat movement abilities were coming back off the GCD. So is this actually happening?<br>
This is something that is still happening. Here is the list I have so far of abilities that are for sure coming off the GCD:<br>
<br>
Havoc - Vengeful Retreat<br>
All Druids - Wild Charge<br>
Arms - Charge<br>
Fury - Charge<br>
Protection Warrior - Ignore Pain<br>
Protection Warrior &#x2013; Intercept<br>
Protection Warrior (PvP) &#x2013; Dragon Charge<br>
Survival &#x2013; Harpoon (Source (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/37795/8))<br>
<br>
<br>
Well that&#x2019;s nice I guess, what about all the other categories?<br>
This is just what we have confirmed so far. There could potentially be more added to the list, but I personally just don&#x2019;t know of any others yet.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;d love to hear from you guys on more examples of abilities that you feel should be off the GCD and why. (Source (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/37795/17))</div></div>
