Get Murgle the Red Murloc Plush and Mug July 9!
The Queen of Tides has returned with Rise of Azshara https://worldofwarcraft.com/news/23014432/, bringing a ton of new experiences to encounter—including many rare creatures—in Battle for Azeroth. One such creature is the elusive rare red baby murloc pet, Murgle. You can find Murgle in Nazjatar’s Bloodfin Village, but you’ll need to summon and defeat King Gakula first. Stirring up a little trouble with the village tadpoles is sure to draw him out.
