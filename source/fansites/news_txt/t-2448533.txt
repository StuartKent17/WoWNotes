Enhancement Shaman PTR Changes
In an upcoming Public Test Realm PTR build, several changes are coming for Enhancement Shamans.

We’re adjusting the following talents:


Boulderfist https://www.wowdb.com/spells/246035-boulderfist damage bonus increased to 35%.
Lightning Shield https://www.wowdb.com/spells/192106-lightning-shield will no longer generate any bonus Maelstrom when the Lightning Shield overcharges.
Landslide https://www.wowdb.com/spells/197992-landslide changed to a 40% proc chance.
Forceful Winds https://www.wowdb.com/spells/262647-forceful-winds reduced from 100% per stack to 80% per stack. Totem Mastery https://www.wowdb.com/spells/262395-totem-mastery: the Storm Totem benefit increased from 5% to 10%.
Hailstorm's https://www.wowdb.com/spells/210853-hailstorm damage increased by 50%.
Overcharge https://www.wowdb.com/spells/210727-overcharge now causes a 9 second cooldown to Lightning Bolt, down from 12 seconds.
Fury of Air https://www.wowdb.com/spells/197211-fury-of-air damage increased by 40%.
Crashing Storm https://www.wowdb.com/spells/192246-crashing-storm damage increased by 40%.


Lightning Shield and Forceful Winds are both popular talents right now, and we don’t want to reduce Enhancement’s overall damage with changes to those two talents, so additionally:


The damage done by all Enhancement abilities increased by 5%.

The changes above should help make the different choices on many talent rows much more competitive with each other.

In addition to these changes above, we’re adjusting how many tooltips are generated. This may cause some websites to show that the damage or healing of almost every single Enhancement ability has changed. Do not panic; we are not lowering all of your damage and healing! This will be a behind-the-scenes data adjustment only.

Thank you for testing with us on the PTR!


Eurogamer Interview with Alex Afrasiabi about Sylvanas
Eurogamer sat down with Alex Afrasiabi https://www.eurogamer.net/amp/2018-11-08-world-of-warcraft-and-the-masterplan-for-sylvanas to discuss Sylvanas and the story of Battle for Azeroth.


https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/sylvanasinterview.jpg https://www.eurogamer.net/amp/2018-11-08-world-of-warcraft-and-the-masterplan-for-sylvanas 



Having a divided fanbase for a character is a lot more interesting than a one-sided, clearly the right direction path.
The goal was to create enough plausible deniability in the actions Sylvanas has committed where she can still have a fanbase.
Alex says that her actions are not necessarily out of character as she has been a driving force for many questionable decisions, such as the blight, over the years.
He refers to the Wrathgate as being under Sylvanas's orders...?
Your choice made to back either Sylvanas or Saurfang will play out over the story and you will find out if you are right or wrong.
For the moment, Sylvanas seems to be too well liked to simply kill off.
The developerbase and Alex are all fans of Sylvanas as well and making her a raid boss would be a bit of a let down.
There is a lot more to Sylvanas's story that hasn't been told yet.



Forbes Interview with Ion Hazzikostas About War Mode
Forbes interviewed game director Ion Hazzokostas https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2018/11/07/blizzard-working-to-balance-warcrafts-alliance-and-horde-players-in-war-mode-raiding/#88d48fb3c183 about the state of War Mode.


https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/forbesbfa.jpg https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2018/11/07/blizzard-working-to-balance-warcrafts-alliance-and-horde-players-in-war-mode-raiding/#88d48fb3c183 



There is a relatively even balance of people who play Alliance or Horde.
Overall win rates in random battlegrounds are "shockingly even."
Epic battlegrounds tend to favor Alliance and the other battlegrounds skew a bit more in the Horde's favor.
The ratio seems of win rates is about 54% Horde and 46% Alliance, not including Rated Battlegrounds.
The amount of players who utilize War Mode currently skew towards Horde.
In Tides of Vengeance, the team is looking into offering some kind of increased rewards for the less-represented faction in War Mode, so the risk and reward are better calibrated.
Ion suspects that many Alliance players had bad experiences in War Mode in the beginning of the expansion and have turned off War Mode because of it.
The purpose of increased awards is to make up for the risk of being killed by the opposite faction, but they want to keep this on equal grounds, and their hope is that increasing the rewards of the less represented faction will encourage more people to activate War Mode when their faction is at a disadvantage.
Ion admits that Beserking is a bit too powerful of a racial ability for some classes and this is why it is receiving a small nerf.
Historically, PvP severs have always been more Horde-favored. It might have to do with player identity in the game, such as wanting to be something battle-hardened like an orc.
Blizzard is also keeping an eye on class and specialization appearance rates in PvP combat.
