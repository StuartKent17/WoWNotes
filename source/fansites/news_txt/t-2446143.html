Kul Tiras was founded by fearless explorers who sailed uncharted waters in search of adventure. As a key member of the Alliance of Lordaeron, the Kul Tiran navy dominated the seas of Azeroth with its legendary fleet. But after years of turmoil and hardship, the kingdom grew isolated and vulnerable to dark influences. Thanks to the help of brave heroes, House Proudmoore has been restored and Kul Tiras is poised to fight alongside the valiant Alliance once more.<br>

<br>
The Zandalari are a proud people whose origins date back to the early days of Azeroth&apos;s history. Their fierce warriors ride dinosaurs into battle, and they possess one of the most formidable naval fleets in the known world. But enemy attacks on their borders&#x2014;as well as unrest within the king&apos;s council&#x2014;have threatened the kingdom&apos;s foundations. By returning stability to Zandalar, the heroes of the Horde can gain a powerful new ally.</div></div>
