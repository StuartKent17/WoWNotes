Gladiator's Plate Legguards: Fixed a graphical display error.
Fixed a bug that caused some systems to see terrain holes appear in the distance.
Stackable items retrieved from mail will no longer automatically stack in your inventory. This has been disabled pending a future patch fix.
Players will no longer see the flickering terrain issues that were introduced with 2.1.0 when the LOD system is enabled. 

I uploaded all the files on Rapidshare myself, and they all survived the jotti.org virus scan  You should be fine. 
Of course if you play on european servers, don't apply this patch yet.

Small note if you don't care about what I write and installed the patch on an european version
Delete wow.exe, run repair.exe, this will patch you to 2.0.0, then you'll have to install the patch to 2.1.0. Faster than reinstalling the game.
