Timewarped 2H Caster Weapon Hotfix
It appears that the Timewarped 2H Weapon spellpower hotfix has come undone with 6.2.2a, as the spellpower on these weapons was reduced again today. 
Timewalking 2-handed caster weapons now have bonus Spell Power equal to that of 1-handed caster weapons.

Like how the emerald drake made sense? If it's via achievement, it really doesn't need any context.
.I'd argue that while this is true, it's so cool and iconic that efforts should be made to make it fit a story/event. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/641648296402878464
Makes perfect sense for a TIMEWALKING mount. Complete all time walking dungeons or something.
TW is a good vehicle, but I think you could do more, eg hidden infinite rares in TW dung's up to no good. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/641650352052244480
