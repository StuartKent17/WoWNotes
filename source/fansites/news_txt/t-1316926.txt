Patch 5.4 - Tier 16 Death Knight Set
This set is definitely not final yet, as there are still a few buggy things like a floating belt.

Patch 5.4 - New Glyphs
Several new glyph spells were added in the last PTR build. Many of these are still NYI on the PTR, so remember that these may never go live.

Raid Testing Schedule - July 8
On Monday, July 8, we will continue testing raid encounters in the Siege of Orgrimmar raid. We'll begin with 10-player Normal testing, and then move on to Heroic and then 25-player mode as the PTR cycle progresses.

Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below for all Public Test Realms.

Monday, July 8

Sha of Pride - 10 Player Normal - 10:30 PDT 13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST

Iron Juggernaut - 10 Player Normal - 16:00 PDT 19:00 EDT, 01:00 CEST

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.

Quality of Armor Sets Art
And this. All the armor use "faded" color schemes. I miss it when the red was RED and the gold was GOLD, not red-ish and gold-ish after lying in the sun and dust for several decades. The armor just doesn't pop anymore. 
Truly colourful gear that really pop can be very cool indeed, the problem with this though is when characters have a mismatch of different colourful armor sets equipped. We received quite a lot of negative feedback back in the day during TBC about "clown gear" making characters look silly, and there were a lot of requests for more toned down armor sets that would allow for better looks when mixing and matching pieces between different sets. 

As you can imagine, it is a rather big artistic challenge to find a good balance that will allow for both colourful and unique looking armor sets that will not look out of place when mixed with other gear.

Also, i am aware i do not know the official statistics of the gear that ppl transmog but I am 100% positive that majority of transmog is from Vanilla and TBC.

You wouldn't even dare try and lie to prove me wrong so tell the creators to make more camp, fancy gear!!!!! 
Vanilla and TBC armor sets are very popular transmog items, and for good reason as many of those sets are iconic and classic Warcraft. On top of that there are also quite a few old-school players who have good memories associated with these sets, so there are definitely more to the attractiveness of them than just the art and design.

Additionally, it is much easier to get the complete classic sets today than it was back when they were high end gear, and this also has an influence on their popularity today because many are finally completing their armor sets that some have been trying to collect for years. Back in the day, if you were not one of the few players who were able to get the complete armor sets and only had a couple of pieces, you often had other pieces equipped that didn't match artistically, which for many resulted in the aforementioned "clown look". This mismatched look issue is much less apparent today as most of the newer sets are more easily matched with pieces from different sets.

PTR
another patch just went by and you guys just complete neglected moonkins yet. Awful 4p bonus. Mobility issues not attended.
Have you noticed that we don't make every change we intend to make before a PTR patch goes out? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350647137618509825
Sometimes I wish our Public Test Realm was a Private Test Realm. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350647281478942720
I've been for private test servers with screened players for 10+ years, but that takes a lot of extra work, to do right.
Enforcing an NDA can be a huge pain in the butt too. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350653642405187585
It might be worth it. Players learning fights when they go live would keep a patch from being "cleared" in a week
We owe a lot to heroic guilds helping us tune raids on PTR. Our untested encounters end up feeling less polished. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350665095988252675

I never understood why people act like the sky is falling at the beginning of ptr. It is a public test realm. Test.
The thing I find most amusing are the IMMEDIATE "rerolling" or "unsubbing" forum posts from the second PTR push. #hyperbolic Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/347885332395593728
I am sure those who care about sub numbers find it assuming as well, you know with the constant sub loss.
Although it is a favorite forum threat, our research suggests very few players quit because of class nerfs. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/347934886901981184
I think they quit because of class changes. It's one thing to have your numbers change, it's another to have mechanics change.
More quit from changes than nerfs for sure. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/348465148295528448
But it's more about "Not sure how to play this dude anymore" and less about "I hate this talent change. Quitting in protest." Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/348465324829581312
And what's the most oft cited reason for leaving? Just curious. "Good game, but I've done all there is to do"?
As you can probably guess, money and time. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/349192403401445376

Will proving grounds actually teach you a rotation or is it more of a way to practice a rotation on moving targets?
It gives you situations you're likely to encounter in dungeons. We don't tell you the solutions to those problems. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/347389627180670976
That is something we could consider in the future if the feature is cool, but it's also info that goes stale quickly if not updated. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/347389740653346816

Proving grounds, virtual realms, class rebalancing, an entire new tier...are you getting help from people pulled off Titan?
All the things you mentioned had to be started months ago to have any chance of making it in 5.4. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/347386533646569472

Models often look different in their raid environment with ambient lighting than they do unpacked by data mining. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/345350600105553920
Firelands Ragnaros was the best example of this. He looked frankly silly viewed as a model. He looked pretty cool in game. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/345350727641747456
