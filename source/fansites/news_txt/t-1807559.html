Salvage Yard Nerf<br>
Unless you were Doing It Wrong&#x2122; your Garrison has/had a Salvage Yard. That&apos;s not an interesting building choice, and clearly the rewards it provided were just too good to value any other potential options. Buildings providing clear benefits at different stages through character level and Garrison progression work out, but the Salvage Yard was just the only correct answer for everyone.<br>
<br>
I totally get that the rewards were really good, and now they are not as good, and... that&apos;s bad because we all like good rewards for little effort, but the goal of balance is not to have one clear path of least resistance, especially considering the gameplay it involved were simply Garrison missions. It was impactful enough a change though that we waited until 6.2 instead of changing it earlier through a hotfix.<br>
<br>
<br>
Upcoming Ashran Hotfixes<br>
We have a couple hotfixes in the works intended to improve the player experience in Ashran, and wanted to bring them to your attention.<br>
<br>
First, we&apos;ve reduced the maximum number of players per side to 40. We&apos;ve also increased the number of available Ashran instances, to compensate for having fewer spaces in each Ashran. Since Ashran was changed in Patch 6.2 to automatically place players in a raid group upon entering, we feel that having 40 players on each side makes more sense, instead of splitting players into two separate raid groups. This hotfix went live yesterday.<br>
<br>
The second hotfix is intended to limit situations where one faction is unable to win events for extended periods of time, by increasing their damage and healing. Once this hotfix is in effect, a bonus will be granted to the faction that has been losing the most events in a particular Ashran instance. For example, when the Alliance are winning more events, the Horde will have the bonus, and vice versa. The bonus is decreased or increased in increments of 5% for every event that faction wins or loses, up to a possible maximum of 50% increased damage and healing in extreme cases.<br>
<br>
In other words, every time your faction loses an event, it will be 5% easier for you to win the next one. If your faction currently has the damage and healing buff, it will go up by another 5%. If the opposing faction has the buff, then it will go down by 5%.<br>
<br>
Please note that, due to the nature of this hotfix, there is no visible buff on the player that shows you what benefit you&apos;re currently receiving. We may be able to add a visible buff in the future, but that would require a patch, and we didn&apos;t want to delay getting this hotfix out. It will go live the next time realms are restarted.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello everyone, I&apos;d like to address some of the common points I&apos;m seeing mentioned in this thread.<br>
<br>
First, I want to stress that the intent of Ashran is to provide a very different play experience than Arenas or Battlegrounds. The vision is a large PvP space where players are moving throughout the zone, competing for rewards, in a faction themed conflict. As many of you know, there hasn&apos;t been enough fighting in Ashran, for a number of reasons and we&apos;re looking to change that.<br>
<br>
One of the most important factors driving player behavior in Ashran is the reward structure and how efficiency drives group behavior. Specifically, I mean that when the same reward is available in multiple locations at the same time, the two factions avoid each other. It is easier and more efficient to not fight for an event if killing a rare offers the same benefit. Right now, at the launch of 6.2, we are in an atmosphere where the primary concern for most players is earning Honor. Honor can be earned throughout Ashran in a number of ways and as a result, there isn&apos;t a lot of competition going on. <br>
<br>
The new season will begin soon and inevitably players will turn their attention to earning Conquest. There are only two ways to earn Conquest in Ashran in 6.2. The first is to complete the quests to kill the faction leader and win 4 events. This will put both factions in direct competition with each other over events and the Road of Glory. The second is to kill 200 players of the enemy faction. Obviously, this drives players to kill each other. Our expectation is that if players feel they can compete for these rewards they will. <br>
<br>
We&apos;re obviously concerned from comments we&apos;ve seen on these forums and within the game that the Horde feel they cannot compete at events and the central road. When it comes to PvP, players will only participate if they feel they can compete. This is the primary motivation behind the mechanic Lore explained above. When a faction falls behind, it is easy for everyone to go their separate ways and never engage the enemy. This buff should help players win some engagements and hopefully build the confidence (and numbers) needed to compete in the larger battles.<br>
<br>
On a related note, I&apos;ve seen comments that the Horde think they are outnumbered in Ashran, but this just isn&apos;t true. We strictly enforce faction balance numbers in Ashran. If there are ten Horde players in Ashran, we will not let an eleventh Alliance player in. We&apos;ve looked at the data several times and it is clear. The number of Horde and Alliance players in any given Ashran is the same at all times. However, there are a lot more Alliance waiting to get into Ashran. Since we enforce faction balance, the only way to get more Alliance players into Ashran is to get more Horde players into Ashran.<br>
<br>
As a small note, I know some people have compared this new buff to Tenacity, but the situation is very different. Tenacity was a buff that scaled based on how lopsided faction balance was in the zone at any given time. Players would have several stacks of Tenacity but they would be terribly outnumbered. We don&apos;t allow either faction to be outnumbered in Ashran. This buff is primarily in place to help the faction that&apos;s losing recover and hopefully win the next big fight. <br>
<br>
Finally, we&apos;ve have seen the feedback about the desire to see premade raid groups return to Ashran but we don&apos;t think this is a good idea. Ultimately, it led to a situation where if you knew to use the premade group finder, you would wait a long time but get into an Ashran where you were guaranteed to win. Unfortunately, if you didn&apos;t know about the premade group finder, you would get in immediately but were almost guaranteed to get demolished. We don&apos;t think this is a healthy environment for the zone to be in.<br>
<br>
We appreciate how passionate everyone has been about the zone. We&apos;ll continue to monitor your feedback here and in-game. Thanks for playing and we&apos;ll see you on the battlefield!<br>

Strongboxes in Random Battlegrounds<br>
We&apos;ve been seeing some confusion about how Strongboxes are awarded in Random BG&apos;s, so I wanted to take a moment to clarify. <br>
<br>
In point-based Battlegrounds (Arathi Basin, Eye of the Storm, Battle for Gilneas, Temple of Kotmogu, Silvershard Mines, and Deepwind Gorge), Strongboxes are awarded based on how many points the losing team was able to earn before the match ended. Earning 500 points will award a Bronze Strongbox, and earning 1000 points will award a Silver Strongbox.<br>
<br>
In capture the flag Battlegrounds (Warsong Gulch and Twin Peaks), Strongboxes are awarded based on how many times the losing team was able to capture the flag. One capture will award a Bronze Strongbox, and 2 captures will award a Silver Strongbox.<br>
<br>
In Alterac Valley and Isle of Conquest, Strongboxes are awarded to the losing team based on how many reinforcements the winning team had remaining when the match ended. If the winning team had 300 or fewer reinforcements left, the losing team will be awarded a Bronze Strongbox. If the winning team had 100 or fewer reinforcements left, the losing team will be awarded a Silver Strongbox.<br>
<br>
In Strand of the Ancients, Strongboxes are awarded to the losing team based on how far they were able to progress before their turn ended. Destroying either the blue or green gate will award a Bronze Strongbox. Destroying the yellow gate will award a Silver Strongbox.<br>
<br>
Of course, winning any Battleground will award a Gold Strongbox. In addition, Strongboxes are awarded to every player on the team that earned them, as long as they are still in the game when the match ends. <br>
<br>
The goal of this system is to ensure that, even if you think your team is likely to lose, it&apos;s still worth your while to put up as much of a fight as possible and stay through to the end of the match.<br>
<br>
A couple days ago I was in a SotA where my team attacked first. We captured the relic, but then the other team captured faster on their turn and we received a Bronze strongbox. Intentional or oversight? Seems like it ought to give a Silver based on those guidelines.<br>
Hmm. You&apos;re correct, it sounds like you should have gotten Silver. We&apos;ll investigate.<br>
<br>
Can you look at adjusting this? Maybe I&apos;ve just been an anomaly, but a small portion of my CTF games have ended as a result of 3 flag caps, the vast majority being 1-0 or 1-1. It doesn&apos;t seem fair that a 0-0 game for 14 minutes with a good play to make it 1-0 results in a gold strongbox on one side, nothing on the other. It&apos;s even more unfair when one team holds a 1-0 lead for the majority, gives up a point to even it up at the end, and gets a Bronze strongbox despite holding a 10 minute lead and losing 1-1.<br>
We agree that the system isn&apos;t working perfectly for CTF games at the moment. I can&apos;t promise any incoming changes as of yet, but it&apos;s something we&apos;d like to improve.<br>
<br>
I thought the confusion was why we were getting old (redundant) gear in the boxes?<br>
We&apos;re looking into this as well.<br>

Be sure to check your mail on alts, as it is not returning automatically currently. <br>
&quot;Return&quot; button on mail removed in 6.2? Why?<br>
For some reason you can no longer &quot;Return&quot; mail as you could before 6.2.<br>
<br>
Any reason this was removed?<br>
This wasn&apos;t intended. We&apos;re looking into it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/378404-return-button-on-mail-removed-in-62-why/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18194084384?page=7#129))<br>

Another Expansion?<br>
I can&apos;t answer on the timing, but we do have more story to tell and more ideas to share. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/378254-another-expansion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18194644723?page=1#10))<br>

Will the unarmored Wolf and Hippo mounts&apos; animation speed also be fixed for 6.2?<br>
Very similar issue, but those will be fixed in the next mini-patch after 6.2. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/611733952290623488))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
When can we expect the illusion &quot;Holy Infusion&quot;? Many are still waiting for it since is was announced for 6.1<br>
It likely won&#x2019;t happen. Scaling the graphic in ways that looked good on most weapons we wanted it to work on was problematic. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/611701030250655744))<br>
<br>
Have there been considerations for rebalancing tier token class distribution? Protector has felt too saturated for a while now<br>
There are no plans for this. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/611701510980788224))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Quick question re: Timewalking. Will mastery still work as though we were 100 in BC dungeons?<br>
Yes, you still have your mastery, and the stat will still increase its effectiveness. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/611733774687023104))<br>
<br>
Was it ever decided it level 100 would earn a reward during Timewalking events? Seals of Tempered Fate was mentioned.<br>
Yes, the Bonus Event quest for Timewalking will award the new Seal (of Inevitable Fate). (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/611733684882804736))<br>
Will it count in the 3-total of week or be extra like the garrison mission?<br>
It&#x2019;s a bonus Seal; doesn&#x2019;t count towards the weekly cap. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/612017657710166016))<br>

Lore<br>
I know this one too! Void Rev&apos;s are the remnants of a species overtaken by Void. Not undead, misclassified. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/611773303074598913))<br>
but aren&apos;t spirits undead lol?<br>
Dave stated NPCs can have more than one classification lore-wise<br>
Well, yes, Mannoroth is an undead demon. Demons know how to raise undead, and he was a demon previously. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/611774499902455808))<br>
do imps possess necromantic knowledge?<br>
No idea, I personally like to think of imps in the Discworld sense, e.g. they will tell you exactly as much as you need to know. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/611775256215158784))<br>
