We don't know yet how many players will be required to complete Zul'aman, actually we're not even sure it will be a level 70 instance. When the Burning Crusade was announced it was supposed to be a low level raid instance at the end of the Blood Elves starting zone but it was "changed" to a level 70 instance, even if some people assume it will be made for 20 players raid, the success of Karazhan makes a 10 players version possible.

We already know the appearance of two of them or at least two monsters related to them, the Eagle God, and the Dragonhawk God.

From the list of the files already available in game, we can also assume there is a Bear God and a Lynx God.

According to the files again, the final boss should be Zul'jin from Warcraft II, but the first informations released about Zul'aman also mentionned Warlord Jin'zakk, who is "A massive gray-furred Forest Troll with huge claws. He practices Dark Voodoo."
