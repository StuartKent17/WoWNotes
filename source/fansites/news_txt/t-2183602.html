Patch 7.2 PTR Notes Update<br>
The Broken Shore<br>
Return to the front lines of the Burning Legion&#x2019;s invasion in this new Scenario. Complete it to unlock a new questing hub with World Quests that make up a new Emissary and faction: Armies of Legionfall.<br>
<br>
Join in a new region-wide, cross-faction effort to construct buildings to fight against the Legion&#x2019;s stronghold.<br>
<br>
New Dungeon: The Cathedral of Eternal Night<br>
The upper chambers of the Tomb of Sargeras were once a place of worship to Elune. Since the Legion&apos;s invasion, fel minions have desecrated this holy place, twisting it into their own image. Now, this site will host a battle that could turn the tide of the invasion. While the Armies of Legionfall engage the fel army directly, a small group of heroes infiltrates the upper reaches of the cathedral in a desperate hope to return the Aegis of Aggramar to its resting place. Inside this new dungeon, you&#x2019;ll face:<br>
<br>
<br>
Agronox - This ancient served the night elves priestesses of the Temple of Elune, tending the beautiful Hanging Gardens. But after the malevolence of the Legion infected the Cathedral, the guardian absorbed fel energy through his roots. Now the twisted Agronox spreads corruption throughout the sanctuary he once protected, believing he has finally achieved his ideal state.<br>
Thrashbite the Scornful - Smashspite&apos;s detestable brother, Thrashbite has been dispatched to wipe out the mortals entering the cathedral&apos;s grand library. The dimwitted mo&apos;arg lacks any respect for knowledge or learning, feeling petty satisfaction as he crashes through ancient artifacts and tramples priceless tomes.<br>
Domatrax - With the Aegis of Aggramar socketed back into its cradle, Domatrax leads an onslaught of demons to destroy the relic.<br>
Mephistroth - With the forces of Azeroth pushing against his front line, Mephistroth has fallen back to the Cathedral of Eternal Night, where he will employ all his cunning to ensure the heroes fail in securing the Aegis of Agrammar.<br>
<br>
<br>
Class Campaigns<br>
Every class continues its campaign to unify in the war effort. Your Class Hall is the base from which you will embark on a new quest chain, find a new potential Follower, and discover new class-specific World Quests.<br>
<br>
All new epic class mounts are now available! Complete the new class mount quests to obtain yours.<br>
<br>
Demon Assaults<br>
The Burning Legion is assaulting Azeroth with renewed determination. Look for Broken Isles zones to come under attack, fight to drive the Legion back, and defend the lands of your new allies.<br>
<br>
Pet Battle Dungeon<br>
Something nefarious is going on in the world of pet battles, and it&#x2019;s up to you to look into it. If you have at least one level 25 battle pet, speak to Breanni in Dalaran to get directions to this new scenario.<br>
<br>
PvP Brawls<br>
A series of new twists on popular player-versus-player activities are on the way. Starting with &quot;Southshore vs. Tarren Mill&quot;, &quot;Gravity Lapse&quot;, and &quot;Warsong Scramble&quot;, PvP Brawls offer a variety of mode, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay. Look for the Brawl option in the Group Finder (default hotkey: i) Player vs. Player tab, under the &lt;em&gt;Casual&lt;/em&gt; selection.<br>
<br>
Transmogrification Sets<br>
A new &#x2018;Sets&#x2019; tab in the Appearances UI is where you&#x2019;ll find this new way of tracking item sets from previous Raids, PvP Seasons, and more.<br>
<br>
Flying in the Broken Isles<br>
Take your final steps to complete the &lt;em&gt;Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part 2&lt;/em&gt; achievement to unlock flying in the Broken Isles.<br>
<br>
Class Combat Updates<br>
The launch of Legion included many updates to class animations, sounds, and spell effects. These will continue in Patch 7.2 with updates to Hunters, Death Knights, and Balance Druids. More are on the way!<br>
<br>
Legion Reputation Updates<br>
Reputation earned beyond Exalted will now contribute towards earning additional rewards from Broken Isles faction emissaries. These new reward caches have a rare chance to reward new faction mounts, such as the Highmountain Elderhorn, Wild Dreamrunner, and Leywoven Flying Carpet.<br>
<br>

Affliction<br>
<br>
Refreshing Reap Souls will no longer overwrite the current buff&#x2019;s duration with a new one. The new duration will now be added to the existing duration, up to a maximum duration of 60 seconds.<br>
Reap Souls (Artifact ability) now has a 5 second cooldown.<br>
<br>
&lt;em&gt;Developers&#x2019; note: Previously, casting Reap Souls at 5 stacks (which would grant 25 seconds of the buff) with 20 seconds currently left on the buff would just overwrite your old 20 second buff with a 25 second buff. Now, in this case it will increase the buff duration to 45 seconds.&lt;/em&gt;<br>
<br>
Souls are now reset to 0 at the start of an encounter. The buff is also canceled at the start of an encounter.<br>
<br>
&lt;em&gt;Reason: Souls are a resource, and we have a rules about resetting your resources/stacks of a buff before an encounter, so that every attempt is standardized.
