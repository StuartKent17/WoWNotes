I&apos;ve noticed that there&apos;s a little bit of confusion as to some comments that were made in various articles that said that (I am paraphrasing here) &quot;Zul&apos;Aman will be more casual than Karazhan.&quot;&apos;<br>
<br>
Of course, what most of us in the WoW community have come to realize over the past few years is that the term &quot;casual&quot; means different things to different people. In fact, I am at the point where I try to avoid using the term at all. I&apos;ve come to discover that most players consider themselves &quot;Casual&quot; when it supports their argument and likewise, they think of themselves as &quot;hardcore&quot; when convenient. We have the largest Casual Hardcore (or Hardcore Casual) community of any MMO out there!<br>
<br>
All joking aside, the clarification is this:<br>
Zul&apos;Aman will be a 10-person raid zone<br>
Zul&apos;Aman will be on a quicker reset than 7 days (some might call this &quot;casual&quot;)<br>
Zul&apos;Aman will be MORE difficult than Karazhan and drop better loot (some might call this hardcore)<br>
Zul&apos;Aman will feature 6 bosses and it&apos;s our goal that you can kill them all in one night -- perhaps 2-3 hour clear times (some might call this casual)<br>
Zul&apos;Aman will not have a key requirement. Nor will it have an attunement quest\ (some might call this casual)<br>
Zul&apos;Aman will have a VERY challenging timed quest for those who choose to participate in it. This *will be* hardcore and will be very rewarding. Players do not have to engage in the timed run (very similar to the Baron run in Stratholme)<br>
We&apos;re tuning the first boss in Zul&apos;Aman to require less raid coordination than some other raid bosses. He will still hit very hard so you&apos;ll need to be geared properly but it won&apos;t take 15 minutes to explain the fight. It will be a simple yet challenging fight. The other boss fights get more complex and challenging from there. If players want a basis of comparison, imagine the tuning of ZA started around Nightbane/Prince difficulty and ramped up from there.<br>

ZA is a very cool looking zone. It will feature brand new troll models -- Forest Trolls. They are very impressive looking. There will also be a large amount of brand new item art in the zone. We&apos;ll get screenshots of this out soon.<br>
<br>
I know this question is going to come up so I&apos;ll answer it now -- Yes, you can totally skip Karazhan if you&apos;re an amazingly elite guild who doesn&apos;t have time to key up for KZ yet can face the challenges of ZA without gearing up in KZ. Have fun storming the castle.<br>
