We’re working on a change to the Arcane Heart  Azerite Trait that was introduced in Rise of Azshara. How it works today is:

Arcane Heart  gives you a buff for every 1.5 million damage or healing you do. However, damage or healing that comes from something other than you casting a spell is not counted. For example, a Blood Death Knight doing healing from Death Strike isn’t benefitting from that healing counting to the next proc of Arcane Heart.

So we’re developing a fix for that. Currently, the change looks like this:

Items

Heart of Azeroth

Arcane Heart 

Fixed a bug that caused some damage and healing effects to go uncounted by this Azerite Trait.
Damage and healing counted to activate Omnipotence is no longer counted while Omnipotence is active.




The second change there is needed to keep this from being a big buff for a Trait that we feel is fairly well-balanced before we make the bugfix.

If all goes well, we expect to bring this fix to the game with maintenance this week tomorrow for Americas realms, and thereafter for EU and Asian realms.
