Spring Balloon Festival<br>
Spring Balloon Festival (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/645-spring-balloon-festival) allows players to take a short balloon ride around a zone.<br>
<br>
<br>
Head to one of the red X markers on the world map to find a balloon.<br>
Once there, speak to the pilot and he will let you sign up to ride.<br>
Actually taking a ride requires a total of three players, so you will have to wait for more players to show up.<br>
The ride will take you elsewhere in the zone and play some dialogue along the way.<br>
You may learn useful things such as the traditional greeting in Suramar city (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/may/HidingASurprise.jpg): <br>
At the end of the ride you are dropped off and the balloon disappears. <br>

Upcoming Mythic Keystone Changes<br>
Patch 7.2.5 is making some changes to Mythic Keystone dungeons (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6592-Upcoming-Mythic-Keystone-Changes).<br>
One additional change we&apos;re making that should hit in the next PTR build, with the goal of providing some extra incentive to run difficulties past the item level cap.<br>
<br>
For every Keystone level above 15, you&apos;ll have an increasing chance for the final chest to contain additional loot. This chance scales linearly, will roll over past 100%, and accumulates pretty quickly: at level 20, you&apos;ll be guaranteed 4 pieces of loot, plus a 5th if you beat the timer.<br>

Windwalker T20 4pc Bug<br>
Seems to me when you crit with RSK the timer on FoF is not dropping at all. I&apos;ve stared at the cd timer during sessions with the practice dummies and not once did I see the numbers skip down 2 secs. I even had the combat log opened to see if I was critting with RSK. <br>
This is fixed in a future build, thanks for the report. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1061095-windwalker-t20-4pc-not-working/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20755025315?page=1#2))<br>
