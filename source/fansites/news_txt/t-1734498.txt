Blizzard CMs
I'm looking for Blizzard participation in the forums. I know it's not a 'directly profitable' function and probably is the first thing looked at when 'do more with less so we can pay a bigger dividend' comes up. But it's a good long term investment to engage your customer audience.
We agree and the WoW CM team has only grown since the game was released "do more with less for bigger dividends" sounds very cynical and has never been an operating procedure for us. We've taken on a host of various responsibilities over the years, but community engagement remains a primary objective.

That said, our "customer audience" expands well beyond these forums and we have to keep that in perspective. There needs to be a larger engagement strategy so our time is well managed.

On a related note, I'm not going to have much time at all today to engage the community because I'm organizing a lot of data in Excel. But that data will later be used to inform how, where, and why we engage the community. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

10% Damage Reduction in PvP
Simply put, we felt that PvP damage was too high across the board. There were several changes in Patch 6.1 that caused a general increase in PvP damage, and this change was meant to counterbalance that. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Hunter Pet Damage
We've just pushed a hotfix that reduces the Cornered damage increase from 50% to 20%. It'll still probably be wise to kill Hunter pets at low HP, but that should make the strategy of purposefully summoning a pet at low health significantly less effective.

20% is still more than 0. So they're still going to do it.
Sure, but it's a much more dangerous tradeoff considering how quickly a low-HP Hunter pet can be killed. There's significantly less reward for the risk. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Blood Elf Model Feedback
The feedback was gathered? i'm not sure about that. "my weapons are far too big!" was said about 5 billion times and they still went forward with it. the smug expressions are still there and the terrible run animations are still there.

Weapon size is a divided topic for sure. We saw lots of feedback  before the models changed that weapons  were  too  small  I think we adjusted weapon size back and forth during testing to hit a spot that most people were happy with, but I know some of you'd still prefer something smaller.

A bug on the DMF's race: sometimes when you hit a post, you get an extra toll. Climb to the blue post and u get 3->5 tolls.

We're hoping to have this addressed in a future patch. For now, try toggling nameplates and/or using a '/tar Jessica' command. WarcraftDevs
