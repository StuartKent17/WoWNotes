Boubouille2011-08-02, 10:52 PMUpdate - For the record, the international codes 009 and 041 only seems to appear on Blizzard's online games trademarks. This isn't a book or anything like that. It appears incredibly likely based on previous trademarks obtained by Blizzard that this is the next expansion. 


Mists of Pandaria
Blizzard just trademarked a very interesting "Mists of Pandaria".
