Not seeing runeforging in #LegionAlpha, can you confirm that they&apos;ve been taken out? Really liked having diff enchants. <br>
Runeforging is remaining, it&apos;s just learned through a quest which the template characters don&apos;t have completed. We&apos;ll fix that. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/672495333209849856))<br>

Mistweaver mastery currently only procs off of Effuse \ Vivify. Intended? Only has 1 proc from 3 hits of Vivify. Intended?<br>
Should proc from Renewing Mist and Enveloping Mist as well. Only procs from the primary target of Vivify. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/672494650637205504))<br>

Where did Shadowform go?! @Celestalon<br>

Is the Pistol shot animation from Rogues final ?<br>
Nope, there&apos;s a snazzy custom animation coming in a future build. Hang tight! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/672532789070200832))<br>

im just wondering if the grimoire of supremacy skinned pets will still be in legion aka the wrathgaurd etc<br>
Yep! The alternate demon pets will be available via Minor Glyphs. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/672494961191813121))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
are the pvp level brackets going to be changed with legion? https://t.co/69CISDYrL0<br>
PvP level brackets are not changing. The gear provided will scale to your level (similar to Timewalking gear). (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/672521095312834560))<br>
<br>
Any change to Ashran loser buff Tues? 7+ groups so far who refuse to ever kill boss for fear of a &quot;debuff&quot;<br>
Killing the faction boss has the exact same effect on the Ashran balance buff as winning one event. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/672532422118912000))<br>

Lore<br>
I just wanted to ask if you knew if Draenor and Azeroth were in the same solar system? <br>
Nope! Vast distances of Twisting Nether between them. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/672258848263036928))<br>
<br>
Why is General Tiras&apos;alan in the Paladin Order Hall? He died at Theramore?<br>
...that clever synth bastard! GET HIM! (Real answer: we&apos;ll doublecheck and fix) (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/672318417219686400))<br>
<br>
state fel magic isn&apos;t arcane. Arcane can be demonic but perhaps not all demonic magic is arcane?<br>
Fel is language of chaos, arcane is language of order. Same spectrum, opposite ends! (The RPG books aren&apos;t considered canon) (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/672523313189548032))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
I don&apos;t think maths are &apos;really&apos; essential, but they are of course handy.<br>
I&apos;d say that at least Algebra *is* essential for most forms of game design. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672129362204884992))<br>
If for nothing else than that you can develop a better gut for numbers used. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672129619261165568))<br>
Sure, you can start with wildly wrong numbers, and iterate, but is slower. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672129788283236352))<br>
Could you provide a real example, please?<br>
It can be complex stuff, like figuring out the paths of Cinderstorm, or... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672130090919059457))<br>
...it can be simple stuff, like estimating how long people will take to... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672130187220246528))<br>
...complete your quest POI, to know how many quests you need to make. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672130303943577600))<br>
(Or what drop rate to make the quest item, to average the intended kill count) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672130462622474240))<br>
Even the less-mathy sorts of designers still use some math. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672130593954508800))<br>
<br>
Do you think that percentages &amp; statistics are the most common types of math? I mean, the most common type of math involved in game design in general.<br>
Beyond basic math? Across all types of game design, probably, yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672131741843193856))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Players may feel it&apos;s arrogance to claim design is a collaboration then outright dismiss their idea w/o dialogue.<br>
I agree, but it&apos;s challenging to have a dialogue with everyone when you are blessed with many players. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671419326575026177))<br>
<br>
Sometimes I feel this is based on it being rare. If admitting mistake was normal, maybe it&apos;d be different?<br>
If you are constantly admitting mistakes, it is possible over time you develop a reputation as sloppy and careless, I suppose. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671694618958815232))<br>
<br>
In other industries, huge mistakes can get one fired. Game devs seem to feel entitled to make mistakes freely.<br>
Iteration is at the heart of design, and that means making a lot of mistakes...and then fixing them! (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/670747190264901632))<br>
<br>
question for you...blizz devs are basically silent nowadays. Was Communication a major reason for the job change for you?<br>
I&apos;ll say that Riot&apos;s comm philosophy is more simpatico with my own. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/670796357741883393))<br>
