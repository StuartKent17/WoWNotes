Happy New Year to everyone! 2011 should get interesting very soon with a minor class balancing patch incoming in the next few weeks see Upcoming Class Changes  and probably patch 4.1 following a few weeks later. 

For the moment, I'm sure most of you still have to level/gear up and try to see most of the content available in the expansion and you probably still have a few days without work to succeed.

Contest Runner Up - Magm...awwwwwwwwwwww
I wasn't kidding when I said that being original could make you win something in the contest, ikki42 's entry was very surprising and proves that you can make anything cute, even Magmaw.
