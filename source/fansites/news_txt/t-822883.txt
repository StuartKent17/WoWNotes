Happy New Year to everyone! 2011 should get interesting very soon with a minor class balancing patch incoming in the next few weeks see Upcoming Class Changes http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2127-Upcoming-Class-Changes-December-27-Hotfixes and probably patch 4.1 following a few weeks later. 

For the moment, I'm sure most of you still have to level/gear up and try to see most of the content available in the expansion and you probably still have a few days without work to succeed.
