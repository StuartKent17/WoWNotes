chaud2018-08-13, 03:53 AMHeart of Azeroth Preview - Battle for Azeroth
In Battle for Azeroth, our Artifact Weapons will be retired and a new Artifact system will come in the form of the Heart of Azeroth http://beta.wowdb.com/items/158075-heart-of-azeroth, an artifact quality neck piece that builds on and evolves Legion's Artifact Power and Netherlight Crucible systems. The line in the sand has been drawn, and the Horde and Alliance are at each other's throats. Because of this, they fail to notice the world around them is dying. Magni Bronzebeard http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/124595-magni-bronzebeard, speaker for Azeroth's slumbering titan, gives player characters a gift from Azeroth herself in the form of this artifact neck piece.

The Basics

The Heart of Azeroth http://beta.wowdb.com/items/158075-heart-of-azeroth will be a neck slot artifact that is used for all of Battle for Azeroth. 
The Heart of Azeroth requires Azerite to empower it. Gaining enough Azerite eventually levels up the artifact and unlocks up to four tiers of traits on your head, shoulders, and chest items depending on the item level of the item. 
Each tier has options that either empower spells/abilities, grants temporary buffs, or survivability traits. You can choose a single option from each tier as you unlock them.
Empowering your Heart of Azeroth will also increase its item level.
The traits offered are class specific and not spec specific. To clarify, the choice of options give you one option from each of your specs along with one option that works for all specs.
Blizzard has stated that higher item level gear will have better options. As it stands from beta, there is only a handful of options for each spec and they are repeated among different gear sources.
You can undo and reselect your traits from Azerite Reforgers in Boralus https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/142066-razzi-the-shaper/Dazar'alor https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/138051-nudara-the-shaper for a certain amount of gold that increases the more times you utilize it. This cost has a few day cooldown, reducing the cost by 50%, similar to the old talent respec costs.

Acquiring the Heart of Azeroth
Soon after the Battle for Lordaeron Scenario you will be directed to meet with Magni Bronzebeard in Silithus. He gives you the quest [The Heart of Azeroth https://www.wowdb.com/quests/51211-the-heart-of-azeroth in which you do a short scenario to stabilize the wound in the planet. Completing this will reward you with Heart of Azeroth http://beta.wowdb.com/items/158075-heart-of-azeroth!


https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/heartofazerothaquire.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/heartofazerothaquire.jpg 



In Depth Look
Let's break this system down a bit further. The Heart of Azeroth is directly connected to your head, shoulders, and chest item slots. Each of these items have tiers that you can progressively unlock when your Heart of Azeroth receives enough Azerite and ranks up. 


The outer tier is the first to unlock and presents a choice between 4 traits to empower your character. Three of these are spec specific and one is based on where the item came from. These are the most important abilities and are unlocked first.
Items from time gated sources will have the middle band and present you with 3 set of traits to choose from. These options are more role specific. 
Next, the inner band can be unlocked to present you with another 2 choices. These usually give you a choice between two different survivability options such as a shield or heal on hit.
Finally, the innermost ability will be unlocked. This is a single option that gives a 5 item level increase to the gear in the item slot.
Each item has a certain Heart of Azeroth level required to unlock the trait ring depending on the item level of the item and slot.



https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/azeritearmorinterface01.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/azeritearmorinterface01.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/azeritearmorinterface02.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/azeritearmorinterface02.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/azeritearmorinterface03.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/azeritearmorinterface03.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/azeritearmorinterface04.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/azeritearmorinterface04.jpg 


The team wants to make sure that this system improves upon our current artifact progression system and lessens the amount of RNG involved. Here are some ways that this new system address these concerns:


The Heart of Azeroth is utilized between all of your character's different specializations and so each spec does not need to be leveled up individually. However, as stated above, the choices presented on the empowered item slots are class specific and not spec specific and are locked when chosen. Players will most likely need to have separate pieces of the same item slot for each spec to prevent crazy gold costs, but no additional Azerite will be needed between specs.
Head, shoulder, and chest items cannot Warforge or Titanforge.
The abilities that each piece of gear contains is the same for all pieces of the same name. Higher item level pieces will have a better selection of traits, but they can all be seen in the Dungeon Loot Journal and are chosen by the design team when creating the item. There is no RNG involved.
Abilities on each band will be paired with other abilities of the same type. For instance, one band will give you an option between different utility traits while another will ask you to choose one from a group of offensive traits.
You do not lose any Azerite when upgrading an item.



Gaining Azerite
Azerite is the lifeblood of the planet. Because of this, both factions are very interested in acquiring as much of it as possible. Much like Artifact Power, Azerite is gained by doing a multitude of different activities within the game.


Nodes
Chests
Creatures
Quests
Bosses - Normal/Heroic/Mythic dungeons grant Azerite for bosses and daily first dungeon quests.
Island Expeditions - Weekly quest https://www.wowdb.com/quests/battle-for-azeroth?filter-weekly=1&filter-search=azerite, occasional rare quest, and some for each win, with an increasing amount per difficulty. 
Warfronts - Wins, World Quests when you own the zone, and more.

Acquiring Azerite Armor
You can acquire Azerite Armor from normal methods with no lockout mechanics including world quests and normal dungeons only up to item level 340. Azerite Armor that is item level 340 or above can only come from sources that have lockouts to prevent farming it excessively. Azerite Armor is not tradeable in any fashion, even if you have a higher item level in that slot.


Only the final boss of each dungeon drops Azerite Armor on Mythic difficulty and below. You cannot receive Azerite Armor from the chest at the end of a Mythic+ run.
Specific raid bosses and world bosses drop Azerite Armor.
Your emissary cache can reward a piece of Azerite Armor. The cache will say "Azerite Armor Cache" if it rewards a piece of gear.
Your Mythic+ weekly chest can contain Azerite Armor.
You can purchase item level 355 Azerite Armor upon reaching exalted with Champions of Azeroth https://www.wowdb.com/factions/2164-champions-of-azeroth.


https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/azeritearmorcache.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/azeritearmorcache.jpg 


Catch up Mechanics
Similar to Artifact Knowledge in Legion, the Heart of Azeroth will help players keep up with the ever-increasing power curve. Over time, the amount of Azerite required to level the Heart will decrease, allowing players the ability to catch up if they’ve fallen behind. The system should help give you a leg up if you need one, but you’ll still need to put forth an effort to keep your Heart of Azeroth’s powers growing.


Heart of Azeroth Item Level Rewards
