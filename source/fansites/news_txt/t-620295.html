<br>
Update 00:25 CEST - We&apos;ve got the source of the infection ! You can get infected by looting the suspicious crates in Booty Bay<br>

<br>
Update 00:00 CEST - Event is going live on ALL servers !!!!!!<br>
<br>
Wrath of the Lich King - World Event<br>
As I write this news, it looks like the pre-Wrath of the Lich King world event has been started on one of the US live servers, we&apos;re still unsure if it&apos;s just an error or if Blizzard is testing the event on a few servers. Below is a small preview of what to expect during this event .... You can probably expect more updates in the next hours if the event is extended to all realms.<br>
<br>
Zombies will randomly spawn in the world (and near cities) and infect anyone they damage.<br>
People infected by zombies can either get cured by other players or by Argent Healers deployed in most of the zones.<br>
If a player or NPC isn&apos;t cured within 10 minutes ... He will turn into a zombie ! <br>
Players changed into zombies have access to a new set of skills (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/october/wotlkworldevent_7.jpg) to let them attack and infect other players. They become friendly with other zombies and hostile to all player factions. <br>
<br>
Also ...<br>
Don&apos;t waste your time finding and creating a level 1 on this server, being hostile with all player factions also means that guards will kill you on sight and pretty much instantly in the case of a level 1 character.<br>
This is probably just the first part of the world event, it doesn&apos;t look fully deployed at all<br>
<br>
You might want to get ready for some serious zombie invasion in the next days ....<br>
