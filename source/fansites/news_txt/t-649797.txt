Boubouille2009-05-24, 09:32 AMMinor patch scheduled before 3.2
In a blue post about the druid's tier 8 set, Ghostcrawler confirmed that at least one more minor patch will be deployed before the Patch 3.2. It's always good to know that we won't have to wait for the next major content patch to see more classes changes and bug fixes.
We have a fix for the current set bonus to make it work the way you imagine it should at a 7 or 8% proc chance. It's our policy not to announce patch dates ahead of time, but it will be long before 3.2. 

Raidcomp updated to patch 3.1
Better late than never, right? During the last few weeks the Raid composition tool http://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com/ has been updated with various changes from patch 3.1. We should now have a fairly reliable version but don't hesitate to point out any error.

Why did it take so long to nerf Jewelcrafting?
The question was asked on this and other issues if it was OP before why did it take so long to nerf it? Usually the answer is some combination of the following and not just with regard to JC:

1 It was only slightly OP until players really started gearing up with new combinations of items that things get out of control.

2 We had a long-term plan to do something differently and decided either that plan was going to get bumped or we couldn't wait for its implementation.

3 We have a really long list of changes we want to make to WoW. Some things just take awhile to get to. More critical issues do get bumped to the top, but sometimes it still takes us a bit to agree on the right change and often bug fixes get even higher priority than design changes.

If you see something that seems off, chances are good that we do too but just haven't gotten to it yet. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367806783-is-there-room-for-minmax-players.html

Player vs. Player
Balance in 2vs2 Arena matches
As we have hinted at several times, part of the problem is the over-emphasis of the 2s bracket. It's easier to organize and more-rewarding -- we get that. We also think it's a problem.

The 2s are just never going to be as balanced as larger brackets. When you only have 2 players on your team you are always going to be at the mercy of a really strong counter-comp -- you can essentially lose as soon as the door opens and you see who's on the other side. Fixing this involves doing a lot of things we don't want to do, such as compressing even more abilities into every class so that you can be assured of having a really large toolbox Mortal Strike, non-physical damage, Dispel Magic, roots, non-DR CC, etc. etc. even with just two characters.

A lot of the "dominance" problems that we see and that players complain about go away when you look at the 3s bracket not there aren't problems that replace them, like the abundance of RMP. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17367806934-inevitable-nerf-of-druids.html

Raids & Dungeons
Sunwell-level raid difficulty
Are you refering to the part where warrior tanks were kept alive by casting an anti-druid aura over the whole raid? Or the part where you stacked shamans for Chain Heal and Heroism rotations? Or where the mages were bumped to make room for more warlocks to benefit from Curse of Shadows? Or where paladins were parked outside to buff everyone in between wipes? 

Players who liked Sunwell generally liked it because it was hard, not because the class balance was so exceptional. Mimiron's big red button is hard if that's your thing. Algalon is hard.

A lot of the tank balance problems we are having exist because we thought block would be a better mitigation stat than it has turned out to be. I say "we" because the druids and DKs were also convinced at the time that they would be mana-sponges and everyone was quoting "The unblocked hit is the new crushing blow."

For a variety of reasons, reality didn't work out that way. For one, we underestimated how much removing crushing blows would change the landscape. In fact, you can argue that the big magic hits the dragon breaths and plasma blasts are really the new crushing blows, and block does nothing to them modulo 4 piece bonuses and the like. DKs were given amazing cooldowns, high armor and high avoidance to make up for them not being able to block. Druids were given even higher armor and high health. We backed druids off from that a little in part because they were going to end up with dps stats almost no matter what gear they chose so we wanted to incorporate those a little more into tanking. We kept buffing DKs based on early mostly heroic dungeon reports that healers hated healing DKs because they were so squishy when their cooldowns were blown. That seems to be less of an issue now with current levels of gear and some of the other changes to the game since then.

We will almost certainly change block. I can't tell you when we'll change it, because it's a big change. We probably don't want shield-users to be at 100% up time of block if they block more per hit. We have to be careful what happens to threat since that's a big part of block, especially for warriors. Heck, maybe we fall in love with the 4 piece warrior bonus and decide to make that a core part of the ability.

We might very well nerf DK mitigation or cooldowns again. We're less worried about druids, but if we nerfed DKs it might be that druids take their place. We are less likely to just buff the shield-using tanks because we like the current difficulty of the hardmode fights for them and we are reluctant to have to buff those encounters to correspond for a tank buff. Though as we've said elsewhere, we might give paladins another cooldown.

Just remember that one player's "slight advantage" is another's "faceroll tanking and trivializing encounters." The balance goal has always been "close enough" not "identical." Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17223093590-the-problem-is-not-dks.html

Itemization
Class-specific items
We don't want to expand boss loot tables. That makes it less likely you'll end up with you want, not more. If we make druid tanking sticks, and druid rings, and druid trinkets, then you have more stuff that other tanks can't wear. Therefore when players say "Please remove this stat from my gear," our answer is almost always "No, because we want other classes to share that gear."

There are always just some sub-optimal items. Those are there by design. Not everything is intended to be an upgrade and we want to reward players who understand the finer points of their class enough to know when something is an upgrade and when it's not. And I'll throw in my standard dig that if you are simply picking something because a spreadsheet or website told you too, make sure you're making the right choice for your character. However some items also have mistakes in them and we are getting those fixed up over time. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17367977092-itemization-team-is-right-you-are-wrong.html

Items upgrades
When bosses reward too well then groups finish the content too quickly and then ask why we haven't released anything new yet.

If an item drops that improves some of your stats but lowers others, that is far more interesting from a game-design point of view than if you *always* knew you were going to get an upgrade. One thing I always stress is that games should be about interesting decisions. Deciding if you can afford the loss of hit to get more strenth, or trying to decide if the parry rating is worth losing a little stamina are interesting decisions. There are not always clear cut answers. It lets players demonstrate mastery of the game when they can make the right choice for their character. A best in slot item is not worth it if you have to sacrifice too much of another stat to use it. An item with tons of defense can be the best thing for you if you are wearing blues to hit the cap, or the worst thing for you if you are already comfortably above the cap.

Intellect more attractive than Spirit
It's not a problem that Int is a more attractive stat that Spirit. You are rarely choosing between the two directly. There are not +50 Int legs that you drop your +50 Spirit legs to equip. If you are a Spirit-using class especially a priest or druid you will most likely have some Int and some Spirit almost no matter what you do.

It is a potential problem when one class can ignore Spirit while another class is required to pick it up. Because Int is more rewarding in the long run, being able to go with just Int means your mana pool and crit are also increasing compared to the dude who has to give up those stats in order to have enough Spirit.

It works if the classes are balanced assuming you don't have Spirit, which is the case for say Resto shamans. It does bad things to the game if we assume you have certain amounts of a stat but players manage to find ways to do without that stat which result in them being more powerful than other classes. Make sense? Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17367597239-why-is-spirit-a-regen-stat-if-int-isnt.html

Tree Form compared to Shadowform and Moonkins
You can make many of the same arguments about Shadowform and Moonkin form that you can make about Tree of Life form. Yet it still feels different. Giving up your healing abilities for damage and utility just doesn't seem the same as giving up your damage and utility to heal.

It may be that giving up healing to compete with damage classes doesn't feel so bad because most damage classes can't heal anyway. But giving up your damage to compete with healers when A the other healers don't have to, and B healer damage isn't great in the first place, just feels a little different.

MP5 vs. Crit as a regen stat
We don't have a problem with paladins liking crit as a regen stat. It only gets to be a problem when the paladins refuse to ever use MP5 and get angry when it shows up on their plate. We balanced paladins around the assumption of having some MP5. If they have no MP5 then it is likely they are too powerful. The same thing would happen if we let say a mage stack all spellpower at the expense of Stamina. 

As I said though, we need to see a few more guilds attempt hard modes to know how regen really stands. I agree with the players who say that people asserting that mana is infinite for any healer haven't tackled enough hard modes yet.

Retribution burst damage in PvP
We don't think burst is a problem in PvP right now. We do think the Ret "rotation" is problematic. You essentially have a spec without a meaningful resource Rets generally don't run out of mana with attacks that are entirely cooldown-controlled, which allows them to be front-loaded. The bubble is certainly powerful along with dispels and things like Freedom. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367977149-possible-solution-to-paladin-opness.html

Hunger For Blood
It's not acceptable for rogues or anyone to have so much power in one talent point. We have said pretty consistently that we don't want Hunger for Blood to remain in its current incarnation long term, however it solves the problem for now of keeping Assassination viable in PvE without it being overpowered in PvP. Other fixes would involve major changes to the rogue tree that would likely cause other issues we'd then have to solve. It's too big a risk when what we have works... for now. We have a long list of things we want to improve in the game. HfB is just one of them. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html

Restoration - Chain Heal in PvE
We're not convinced there is a Resto or Chain Heal problem in PvE. Part of what we wanted to do was give shamans other spells to cast besides CH. Riptide is an awesome spell and seems to be fun for a lot of shamans. People are still casting CH, and probably a lot more often than priests are using PoH and druids WG depending on the fight of course. We would want to make sure that any change to CH didn't send shamans back to the Sunwell world of just using that one spell.

Yes it is iconic, and it's fine if shamans use it a lot. If they only use one button, shaman players are likely to mush their brains. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17367876728-it-is-time-to-address-chain-heal.html

Titan's Grip
The problem with TG is that it provides too much of a dps increase for one point. What other talents you can reach or not reach is irrelevant to that point. We don't want one talent point to inflate your dps by 20% or more. That sets a really dangerous precedent, makes other talents seems like a waste, causes Fury damage to jump enormously as soon as they can reach that talent and a host of other problems. 

[...] TG would probably be a lot better as 10 point talent. The fact remains: do those other talents improve your dps? Yes. Do they improve it without TG? Yes. Do they improve it with TG? Yes. Does equipping a higher item level weapon improve your dps? Does Titan's Grip somehow negate your equipping that weapon because of its penalty? No. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html

Titan's Grip Penalty
We're happy with the damage reduction. The haste and hit reductions had other problems. Since TG adds too much damage, taking some away seems like the right choice. It's an unusual talent; it's unfortunate but not too surprising that it has taken some time to get right. Warriors were doing too much damage in Naxx and not just on gimmick fights and not just when fully geared. Some warriors are used to doing rogue damage, but that's not our design any longer.

1H Fury
We aren't trying to keep 1-handed Fury viable. We aren't trying to keep two-handed Enhancement viable. We aren't trying to keep staff-using warriors viable. Just because you can equip something doesn't mean you have a right to be effective with it. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html

Improving Fury DPS
We have a different plan for improving dps, one that should also make the rotation a little cleaner. It's something that has been suggested on the forums a few times. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html
