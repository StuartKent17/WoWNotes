Ghostcrawler is Now Lead Game Designer at Riot Games<br>
Ghostcrawler left Blizzard last month (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3597-Ghostcrawler-to-leave-Blizzard-Entertainment) to pursue a &quot;great opportunity for something new and exciting&quot;. He updated his LinkedIn today to list his new position of Lead Game Designer (http://www.riotgames.com/careers/lead-designer) at Riot Games. <br>

&lt;/div&gt; His title is the same title as Morello. I wonder if he got replaced?<br>
Nah - League&apos;s a huge game and there&apos;s a lot to do. GC&apos;s actually some MUCH-needed help on the leadership side - it&apos;s just too much for any one person to handle and make the progress I&apos;d like to see. We&apos;ll be dividing up some of the effort on leading it, but other than making sure more things have support, the teams are pretty unchanged from who&apos;s doing want (Statikk and friends are still doing Game Health, Meddler still heads champ development, we just have more expertise to draw on now).<br>
<br>
A lot of the things we want to focus on with game health this year (and preseason is a kick-off to this effort) is primarily around fixing a lot of the old problems. After finishing up support (IE the gold item particulars + Annie problem), we want to focus on adding choice and depth by taking a HARD look at &quot;ball of stats&quot; stuff so we can actually introduce interesting stuff with trade-offs.<br>
<br>
IF he is able to make league more about playing better then the other team then just picking the more OP team then I think he can be a good asset for Riot.<br>
<br>
I am looking at this optimistically in hopes that it will make more champs viable and perhapws even breaking the ADC is a must meta to some degree.<br>
I appreciate the positive thoughts.<br>
<br>
I worked with Greg both directly and indirectly for years. He&apos;s an awesome guy who took on the impossible task of doing what Morello has done for league for so long on a game where people are incredibly invested in their character and any nerf is an extremely personal offense.<br>
<br>
It&apos;s a tough, tough job. Greg tanked it like a champion.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m excited to see how helps bolster our ranks.<br>
&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&lt;/div&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
A while back we asked (https://polldaddy.com/poll/7666760/?view=results) if you still wanted to see occasional Ghostcrawler Tweets and the majority did. <br>
<br>
Keep in mind that he is no longer is speaking for Blizzard in these tweets.<br>
I am no longer working on WoW. You should consider any Blizzard comments I make my personal, if educated, opinions. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411970495244812288))<br>
<br>
Dev Feedback<br>
I dunno, you guys manage to sound pretty trite and curt and certain on the forums, too.<br>
We&apos;re never certain. Game design is very much a crap shoot, tempered by experience, feedback and your gut. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/410100823155171328))<br>
<br>
If you left WoW because of the community I wouldn&apos;t blame you, some of the people tweeting and blaming you...<br>
No way. I was just ready to work on something else. Ultimately game developers want passionate communities! (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/417825248558333952))<br>
<br>
But most polls suggest the talent changes were liked overall, even if they weren&apos;t 100% liked. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412002930158350337))<br>
Who was polled and when? the existing community at cata launch? the lost subs between then and now? wtb better metrics<br>
Blizzard has excellent metrics overall, but are also smart enough to know when not to let metrics make the decision for them. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412008412063338496))<br>
People distrust metrics they have no ability to see. Is more transparency in some of these cases worth while?<br>
My fear was always that players would swap from giving feedback on what was fun and try to become data analysts instead. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412296197496242176))<br>
<br>
Game Design<br>
makes me also wonder who in Blizzard ever came up with the idea that grinding was fun? The reward is fun.<br>
Some players enjoy being recognized for commitment and not just raw skill. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411974432479916032))<br>
<br>
How can an evolving MMO be designed around zero grinding, zero RNG and constant meaningful rewards?<br>
Player made content maybe? (Not a WoW announcement by any stretch.) (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411971190228410368))<br>
<br>
but this is an interesting question: how to deal with frustration. Is it something devs take in account?<br>
Totally. As I said, too much frustration can make players quit. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411962033429434368))<br>
But, when rewards come too easily, that can lead to boredom, which can also make players quit. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411962163163447296))<br>
<br>
Oh, glad you pointed this out, I clicked and saw she cited me and there. Maybe some people would be surprised .<br>
I thought the 275 vs 300 food was perfect. It really let folks decide what kind of player they wanted to be. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411184057003679744))<br>
Interesting to see if player behavior changes post-itemsquish, when they&apos;re choosing between +24 and +25 food.<br>
Yes! Like that economic study that shows folks will drive across town for cheap gas but not $100 savings on a dress. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411193837285957632))<br>
<br>
So Greg, what&apos;s your thoughts on two vs. three factions in an MMO? <br>
If I was doing a new MMO (I&apos;m not) I would have one. H vs A is good for WoW overall IMO, but is a barrier to playing with friends. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411186782458228736))<br>
<br>
I think mmo gameplay is fun because for me it taps into desire to optimize, gain much power...and be better than others.<br>
One thing I underestimated as a designer is how some players simply prefer clear power gains to interesting choices. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/422957635013320704))<br>
<br>
RNG sucked on items like trinkets, etc it will suck even more on gear. RNG != fun<br>
RNG is a challenging philosophy for designers to explain. Players typically want to minimize it, but there is risk in doing so. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411184855087464448))<br>
RNG is a challenge for players to overcome, but that sometimes gets turned into pleas to overcome it by removing it. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411185225440296960))<br>
We *think* we want to minimize it. But the other side of that hill has a lot less grass on it than we claim to see.<br>
Being able to reliably predict outcomes makes games boring. Even chess has a form of RNG in the actions of your opponent. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411194484899061760))<br>
Calling bullshit. Chess is pure strategy, no RNG at all. RNG would be if pawn takes queen had an 85% chance.<br>
Perhaps you could say games need unpredictability, which can be provided by RNG or lack of complete information. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411967600881446912))<br>
In the internet age, it&apos;s hard for games to have incomplete information (you Google everything) so RNG has grown as a tool. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411967812270186496))<br>
Back when I played Wasteland or Wizardry 6, you had to &quot;solve&quot; boss encounters and BiS lists on your own. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411968032349511680))<br>
You are conflating random behavior with strategy, which is... wrong. Very much so.<br>
Same is true of gear. &quot;Should I take this upgrade?&quot; (RNG) is more interesting than &quot;Just 3 more Immerseus kills and I&apos;m done.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411981105693093889))<br>
What if I&apos;m just -really- sick of Immerseus? I don&apos;t want to spend a year trying to get one item. :-\<br>
Immerseus is there regardless. Would you rather have a shot at gear or know 100% of it will be sharded? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412004788813824000))<br>
<br>
I understand the good RNG does but getting screwed by it feels REALLY bad. We don&apos;t like feeling helpless.<br>
Yeah, and we implemented some very bad luck protection systems. With millions of players, someone is going to be the 0.01% dude. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411979269158350848))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
This makes me sad. Cata heroics at launch were so much fun with friends.<br>
I agree. There was just no alternative for solo players. Maybe that problem is fixed now. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413707830202339330))<br>
<br>
I know why they wouldn&apos;t come back, but I miss the days of 2hr dngns because of the sterility.<br>
I am totally a big, long dungeon customer. But I recognize not everyone is. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411190243212013568))<br>
How did 5M end up in its current state? It went from being the most important part of the game in Classic to the least in MoP<br>
Overall, I think zerging dungeons just became more popular, which meant dungeons had a shorter lifespan overall. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411977457722343424))<br>
Not blaming players for that trend necessarily, and as I said, I like orchestrating pulls and CC personally. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411977578170171392))<br>
<br>
what happened 5 mans, used to be so many in BC/Wrath, also not very rewarding. Used to love spamming them for badges.<br>
Keeping dungeons (or any content) relevant when you start to outgear it is a big challenge for WoW. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/410104220595924992))<br>
Players would exhaust them quickly. Few want to run the same dungeon 6 times a night, 2-3 nights a week. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/410104084067123200))<br>
It&apos;s more scenery though than same raid instance 7 nights a week in several difficulties on several characters...<br>
Just depends on what you&apos;re into, but the WoW biz works best when players have things to do for weeks rather than come and go. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411191386147270656))<br>
<br>
the lack of new 5 man&apos;s is why I stopped playing. No &lt;60 min content for tanks. I&apos;m not gonna drop mid raid &amp; strand a group.<br>
Adding new dungeons is challenging. Players tire of even 3 new ones in a patch pretty quickly. You need a steady drip of them. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413707551771860992))<br>
<br>
What&apos;s your stance on Challenge Modes? Did they accomplish what you guys wanted?<br>
I think they were a big success. They didn&apos;t of course scratch the itch for players who want hard but not necessarily fast. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413708103616438272))<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t know how the trend was interpreted by devs, but at times it had felt a bit like &quot;Players do X therefore X is good&quot;<br>
No, that&apos;s the Mechanar Syndrome I talk about frequently. Few were running Mech every day because it was their favorite dungeon. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412293304668012545))<br>
Personnaly, i found chain running mech more fun than dungeons zergfests we have now.<br>
Hopefully it doesn&apos;t have to be one or the other, but I agree with your statement. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412974501555499009))<br>
<br>
LFR and LFD is why WoW is doing as bad as it is right now You chew up content fast plus people no longer make friends<br>
Before LFD, many players just never ran dungeons. I think it&apos;s a myth that it forced everyone to find friends. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411973580214108160))<br>
While I agree with you Greg I wish it was more rewarding to do with friends.<br>
We were worried LFD would not catch on. We were wrong. Now we need more incentives to play with friends. Some announced at B&apos;con. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412296476904026112))<br>
<br>
A large portion of the players on my server use it almost exclusively... getting rid of it is getting rid of them.<br>
Yeah, LFR brings a lot of benefits for sure. I&apos;m just not sure it&apos;s enough to keep players engaged for months. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411973797449703424))<br>
<br>
Do you think LFR was better or worse for burnout? Personally I could stand 2-3 runs of a LFR vs 10-20 of a dungeon.<br>
Maybe, but that LFR might &quot;last&quot; 2-3 weeks and the dungeon 2-3 days. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/410446949033054210))<br>
Because of loot cap. Real life time vs /played time. Which one should a dev be more concerned with?<br>
Ultimately whatever keeps someone playing. Folks who only run new dungeons for a week or two might not come back next time. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/410503297284333568))<br>
<br>
Why isn&apos;t it? Healers and DPS have roles; why can&apos;t tanks? Let them play a tank in PvP if they want to.<br>
Other players tend to not have fun when facing a character who takes little damage and has a lot of control. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/410448985111793664))<br>
Why do tanks have this much control? Control use to be DPS&apos;s job. Now all DPS do is spam buttons for big numbers.<br>
Tank control grew out of a need to keep everyone safe by controlling the mobs. I agree that it has taken away from the DPS though. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411191067396956160))<br>
<br>
Min/maxers have for too long hijacked the gearing narrative. I hope this ends the player driven madness.<br>
Sadly, it won&apos;t. You&apos;ll still see flex raids that demand heroic gear. Being labeled suboptimal is the worst of sins online. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411186535598260225))<br>
<br>
Theorycrafting for me is about understanding how the game works, not about min/maxing.<br>
I think it&apos;s useful to know a potential max target. It&apos;s unhealthy to assume that is obtainable. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411185610842316800))<br>
<br>
Items<br>
what is the design goal behind making fun items with very long cds?<br>
The idea is the &quot;fun&quot; quickly turns annoying when they are spammed. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/415644271304138752))<br>
<br>
i&apos;m confused, does Gold have a reason to exist now or doesn&apos;t it? This is more exciting than repair bills, yet those stay?<br>
Repair has a role in the game - giving you the occasional reason to visit towns and providing a small penalty for dying. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/414090185127649280))<br>
Reforging is little different from &quot;push button -&gt; get stat buff.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/414090366736805888))<br>
<br>
Equipping bracers feels mandatory, why don&apos;t you remove that too?<br>
You have to actually earn the bracer by accomplishing something. Reforging is just a button. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413701182347960320))<br>
<br>
Werent you just tweeting about minmaxing only 4 a fraction of the playerbase + huge stat value difs being your prob?<br>
Yes. The idea is removing the burden of players feeling like they must do unfun things for trivial stat gains. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412975143736967168))<br>
Problem is: Your team is shit at itemizing stats for certain specs. Enhance reforges almost every part (PvP)<br>
Their goal is not to put everyone&apos;s best stats on everything.... (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413709256043425792))<br>
Because without reforging, some specs would be so bad that they would be unviable. Fix that issue, then we&apos;ll argue.<br>
We balanced around the gear that actually existed not theoretical gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413875838950449152))<br>
<br>
That comment essentially kills the desire to have alts.<br>
If you can gear your 10 alts in a reasonable time, then I gear my 2 alts instantly and get bored. How to solve? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413702613255733248))<br>
More account bound gear would help with that a lot IMO. Timeless isle was a good step.<br>
Solutions like that are nice because then you&apos;re actually playing some character instead of just having all the alts caught up. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413876815308935168))<br>
<br>
Have they considered making a tier item for all slots, but still only having 2/4 set? Might solve the breaking the set prob.<br>
Yeah I mentioned this a couple of weeks ago. You could also have different ways to complete a set, or a transferable bonus. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413701456315707392))<br>
<br>
Races<br>
Are you happy with how the Worgen turned out? I personally was disappointed with the females after the drafts seemed cool.<br>
When game art is very controversial, it&apos;s hard to call it a victory. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411969873007214593))<br>
<br>
.&quot;Slam dunk new race&quot;? (Maybe someone else can enlighten me what does that mean)<br>
The team was very excited about goblins and worgen. That level of passion doesn&apos;t (yet?) exist for say ogres and arrakoa. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411974136483688449))<br>
I always thought back in vanilla that overs would be playable before anything else, including goblins.<br>
I personally have always been a huge ogre fan. I think they&apos;re cool with a decent amount of lore. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412016381035433984))<br>
If WoW truly was my fiefdom as the forums would have you believe, the ogre, centaur and nerubian player races would be OP. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412016581061787648))<br>
<br>
Classes<br>
Do you think WoW could ever have room for a bard based class/spec? Blizz is the only dev I would trust to make them cool.<br>
I think it could be done. I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s very likely. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412290045148553216))<br>
<br>
Now that youve moved on from Blizz, what truly was the design intent for Ret in pvp?<br>
I don&apos;t think it was a mystery. They have a lot of utility and some ability to heal in a pinch but at the cost of mobility. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411978025333301248))<br>
<br>
mostly you say how in pve it will be/it is. i feel like you still dont care about pvp at all<br>
Most players want spec diversity in PvE. In PvP more of a mixed bag - some players are happy with few but balanced spec options. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/410105387472277504))<br>
<br>
So now that you&apos;re out, I have just one question...Arms. Why?<br>
We nerfed Arms too hard trying to solve the early Shockwave + TfB problems. We buffed them in 5.4, but it was too much. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413705132509913089))<br>
TfB was flat out bad design. Lazy. It was a slap in the face. All of the tropes, because it could 1 hit. F that.<br>
Our thought was that very rare occurrences don&apos;t have much balance impact because they are so rare. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413877410728140801))<br>
im assuming that that has changed inthe devs minds, considering the backlash from community over tfb<br>
Yeah I admitted that in a second tweet on that subject. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/414091895510290432))<br>
<br>
and, why has it persisted as a pve stepchild for so long, especially when fury can do it all too?<br>
But overall the design goal for &quot;Why have multiple DPS (or healer) specs in one class?&quot; has proven difficult to answer. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413878704863838209))<br>
Maybe WoW would be better if rogues had 1 spec, warriors had 2 and so on. Shrug. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413878846627139585))<br>
I don&apos;t follow.<br>
Maybe warrior should be Fury and Prot (no Arms). Maybe hunter should be Hunter (no MM, BM or SV). (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/414089546834264064))<br>
We always struggled to define reasons for players to play both warrior DPS specs or all 3 mage specs, etc. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/414089691311267840))<br>
<br>
I&apos;m a believer that content should follow lore. But new classes are fine. I&apos;m trying to think of a new class that isnt dumb<br>
I feel there is a lot of untapped class design space. D&amp;D, Pathfinder etc. still come out with clever new ideas. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413703647264927745))<br>

i&apos;m on the side of stopping wow being dumbed down personally<br>
Based on your previous tweet, do you feel like removing mandatory choices is dumbing down? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413699145979805696))<br>
Because that is an argument I hear. Knowing that DK = Strength may not be a choice, but it is something you have to learn. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413699437047717889))<br>
I also wonder how much of the &quot;dumbing down&quot; discussion is because players themselves are much more sophisticated now. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413699602328465408))<br>
In BC, folks wondered if an item or talent was good. Now that knowledge is readily available in seconds to most of us. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413699818490306562))<br>
<br>
How do you personally feel about the new talents? Did it resolve issues from the old one? Did it present any new issues?<br>
Overall, I vastly prefer the new model, as a designer and player. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412008603000651776))<br>
Old issues: Things like respecing at key levels to get gold medal talents you were expected to have. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412011798259179520))<br>
Old issues: &quot;Your X has a 20/40/60/80/100% to cause Y, and BTW it&apos;s crippling if Y doesn&apos;t happen so you better spend 5 points.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412012177629786112))<br>
Old issues: designers always moving powerful talents deeper in trees to stop players from getting broken &quot;hybrid&quot; builds. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412012333175541760))<br>
New issues: Not every spec gets a true choice at every tier yet. That feels possible to design though. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412012773556502528))<br>
New issues: Some players just like more choices, even if the choice is an illusion, or can&apos;t actually be designed. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412012633525452800))<br>

Past<br>
now that u have left? Do you think theyll ever update silvermoon to flyable? Or is it a NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN situation?<br>
I doubt it will ever happen. The time investment is just too great. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412976862218838017))<br>
I don&apos;t get how a zone in the xpak that introduced flying was designed unflyable...<br>
Those buildings in Silvermoon aren&apos;t there. They are all ugly facades like a Hollywood backlot. And even that SM took months. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413705899304177664))<br>
<br>
Just how complicated was it to make the capitals flying friendly ?<br>
Very. The original cities were all fake. There were several SW Cathedrals, and the castle was kind of a skybox. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413704092746145792))<br>
Buildings in WoW are hand-crafted by dungeon artists, and cities have a lot of buildings. It took months. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413704270249091072))<br>
Blizzard employs X artists. If some of those work on Silvermoon, then something else isn&apos;t going to get made. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413704406467502080))<br>
Even hiring more artists still makes the choice between working on something old or something new. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413704502915518465))<br>
<br>
I feel Blizz did the Cata revamp in a wrong way, and now will be afraid of any revamps. <br>
What would you consider the right way? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413708692828061696))<br>
Restructure 1-60 quests without altering timeline of those quests. Phase Azeroth zones for level 80+ players.<br>
Isn&apos;t that twice as much quest content though if we had to make 2 versions of say Badlands? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413875326670737408))<br>
There was some hope that BC and LK could be updated as well, and maybe that can still happen some day. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413875581235638272))<br>
We caught 1-60 up to &quot;modern&quot; time so that Deathwing and the Cataclysm could be front and center. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413875486826053632))<br>
The revamp was nice and needed, the problem was that Blizzard tried to swallow more than it could chew.<br>
Doesn&apos;t Blizzard always? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/414091444115099648))<br>
<br>
Why was Path of the Titan scrapped and will they ever introduce it?<br>
It wasn&apos;t in a good enough state yet. I still like the idea of power progression that isn&apos;t related to gear or character levels. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413710982393774080))<br>
<br>
Why was there never again an event like the Ahn&apos;Qiraj gate opening and quest line?Were there ever plans to do smth similar?<br>
Concept was cool. Reality was grinding linen and Silithus lag. I&apos;d love to see the team try again knowing what they know now. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411187817654390784))<br>

Misc<br>
Can you clarify this? A few months ago you said the WoW team was getting bigger which would result in more freq content, yes?<br>
The team has grown with the hope of delivering content faster. It has taken time, and they aren&apos;t quite there yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411962547030335488))<br>
<br>
but I think MMO devs should aim to inspire. it&apos;s not always about the outcome, but adventure.<br>
I agree, and it&apos;s easy to get caught up in mechanic and number tuning and not the grand adventure that it is supposed to be. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412298164356411392))<br>
<br>
I think the biggest thing that explains WoW sub losses is the diversity in the mmo market now. I think tmmos are more niche.<br>
Is that true though? My prediction (sans data) is that fewer players are playing any MMO today relative to say 5 years ago. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412003656767008769))<br>
<br>
Greg, record subs in Wrath. All since then has been dumbing down, making the game easier. Subs now 1/2 max. Why?<br>
I tend to think because the game is 10 years old and not exactly easy to get back into, esp. if your friends move on. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411979473869737984))<br>
I really don&apos;t think it has much to do with game features or direction at all, but that is my opinion and not a Blizzard statement (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411979648851902464))<br>
<br>
24% of customers left under and he &quot;quit&quot; on his own <br>
WoW was never &quot;under&quot; me, so I wouldn&apos;t be the right person to can. Personally, I would get my facts straight before I trolled. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/410103153665658880))<br>
<br>
Why did MoP do nothing but bleed subscribers throughout its life cycle? Besides the game being old.<br>
I say this frequently, but players vastly overestimate the degree to which design changes cause sub loss. Vastly. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412015585040408576))<br>
The guy who quits because his work schedule changes tends to not broadcast that fact. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412016208553062400))<br>
The rage quits so often cited on forums seem more common than they are because they&apos;re on forums. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412016119369592832))<br>
It&apos;s more likely to be an issue when a player returning after 2-3 years can&apos;t recognize the game any longer and leaves again. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412015795376365568))<br>
Number of players coming and going has always been fairly high. Fewer new players are trying the game these days. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412015423979130880))<br>
<br>
Was driven by YOU saying so. Be4 that players didn&apos;t remotely consider change velocity when proposing/complaining abt changes<br>
Pretty sure I&apos;ve never said that specific changes cause a lot of players to quit. Too much change overall can and does. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412298000711446528))<br>
coming back after 2 years, I&apos;m surprised at the faction change rate for the top Alliance guildsAlli needs buffs<br>
My opinion is that Horde racials are too raid friendly, but my opinion doesn&apos;t count for much. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413702981947625472))<br>
<br>
But those who have lapsed may have done so because the game was getting boring and wasn&apos;t changing enough.<br>
Yeah, like I said, that may cause current players to lapse. But too much change can make it hard for others to return. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/417426023190233088))<br>
<br>
I dont get that. I&apos;ve been here since 04 and quit and came back more times than I can count. Ive never been lost due to it =\<br>
Would be awesome if more players were like you, but we also know many do come back and quit again quickly because they feel lost. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412295876279689216))<br>
<br>
End of WoW for me was watching my server die and Blizzard doing nothing to resolve the problem.<br>
What do you think they should have done? Free moves have limited effect and forced moves are very unpopular. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412003911013105664))<br>
Should combine servers and if people cant get the name they want, well that sucks but itd be the price to pay. Just IMO<br>
As I&apos;ve said, WoW gets a lot of returning players. It&apos;s not a great experience when you can&apos;t find your friends or guild or name. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412295358509625344))<br>
<br>
MoP has done a lot of damage to WoW. Lot of those people that have left will not be back.<br>
You seem to be linking business data with an opinion on content, which is tenuous. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411191656570822656))<br>
it&apos;s also an accurate representation of how content is perceived by the community.<br>
Now both can be subjectively right, but how does that become a measurement of community views? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411969561768898560))<br>
you once said fallout from talent changes was anticipated. Too many choices like that slowly ate away at subs over years.<br>
The conclusion from your tweet seems to be that no design should be changed ever because someone won&apos;t like it and might quit. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412003065185595392))<br>
No sir, not at all. But there should be a better reason than &quot;someone complained on forums&quot; Wrath/BC were very good models<br>
Blizzard would never radically change a design because of just a few isolated complaints. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412008172535029762))<br>
I didn&apos;t think so, but that&apos;s often the official explination. &quot;this was too complicated, so we&apos;re changing/removing X&quot;.<br>
There is complication because something is confusing for new players, which is legit, but understandable that vets don&apos;t agree. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412013453872615424))<br>
early wrath, I tanked in fury once. I enjoyed experimenting with talents even if it wasn&apos;t &quot;optimal&quot; for patchrk situations<br>
The game supports a fair amount of that, but whether fellow players tolerate it is a different story. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412298592880050176))</div></div>
