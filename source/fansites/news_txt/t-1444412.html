Recent Ban Wave<br>
We have recently taken action against a number of accounts for the use of third party programs. Such programs not only give their users an unfair advantage, but are a violation of the World of Warcraft Terms of Use, and go against the spirit of fair play. Due to our policies on the protection of player privacy, we&#x2019;re unable to discuss specifics except directly with those whose accounts have had action taken against them.

Bladefist been taken off the connection date again?<br>
Unfortunately it&apos;s been temporarily postponed. Haomarush and Dragonmaw was on the list too, and that&apos;s also been delayed. I&apos;ll let you know as soon as they&apos;re back on the schedule, sorry for the hold-up guys.

So is it you that I need to poke to fix the Argent Charger/Ebon Hold Gryphon not being account wide? <br>
Hey, I hotfixed this. Should be live soon. Thanks for mentioning! (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/420989751018004480))<br>
BAD NEWS! Data was fixed but when pushed LIVE made a mess. T_T Have to wait for a patch &amp; new tech/DB crawl. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421085094808281088))<br>
<br>
Xmog question. Thoughts on opening up FoS for Vanilla GM PvP Gear account wide? Have the FoS on my priest, want to Xmog Pally.<br>
Up to item peeps. Doesn&apos;t seem to jive w/ their current thinking but who knows. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421510501453950976))<br>
<br>
Any chance of us ever being able to do Dragon Soul LFR higher than 85? Really nice xmog sets in there!<br>
Unlikely that it&apos;ll just be opened up as is, but future system changes may make such viable. Until then, grab some friends! (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/420979471449993216))<br>
<br>
Still xmog query, what about making tier sets complete. Like dk tier 10.25 or warrior tier 10.5?<br>
I often pester the poor item peeps about that sort of thing. I hope one day we can do a comprehensive cosmetic gear pass. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421509071385026560))<br>

PvP<br>
will there be a new mount available with the achieve &quot;glorious combatant&quot;? Just got my tiger &amp; love love love it.<br>
Unfortunately, there won&apos;t be. It&apos;s going to be a little unorthodox content-wise. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421713959469580288))<br>
thank you for the reply! <br>
The idea behind them is that since they are character only, you may want to do it next season for an alt. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421718543139237888))<br>
will there be an adjustment so I can solo pve mobs easier or will I have to collect a pve set to do pve things? I assume the latter<br>
Even at ilevel 522 the PvP gear is pretty good for killing world mobs. But the new PvP gear will have a higher ilevel. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421724594479718400))<br>
<br>
I know WoD brings a new PvP zone, are we going to see any new bg maps? Not a new game type but maybe (ex) AB gameplay but new map?<br>
We&apos;re focusing our bg efforts for launch on the tools side (so we can make bgs faster) and creating Ashran. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421724431572942849))<br>
<br>
Is it in the plans to add a 500k and 1 million hk&apos;s achievement by the launch of WoD?<br>
We won&apos;t add those until we find a good way to fix the HK farming that goes on in battlegrounds like IoC. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421718304508493826))<br>
