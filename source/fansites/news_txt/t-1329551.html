Patch 5.4 - Heirloom Raid Weapons<br>
Along with all of the other Siege of Orgrimmar loot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-build=17260&amp;filter-quality=16), Patch 5.4 adds some Heirloom weapons that drop from Garrosh (ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-bind=10&amp;filter-patch=3388&amp;filter-ilvl-min=500&amp;filter-quality=16). These items do not drop in Raid Finder difficulty, only Flex, Normal, and Heroic. Keep in mind that nothing on the PTR is final until it goes live.<br>

General<br>
<br>
Wild Mushroom (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/88747) for Restoration Druids now summons a single mushroom at the friendly target&#x2019;s location. If the mushroom is recast, the mushroom moves to the new location and retains its accumulated bonus healing.<br>

<br>
<br>

Guardian: Increases the amount healed by Healing Touch (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5185) by 20%. Increases the critical strike chance of Mangle (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/33878) (Bear) by 10% and critical strikes of Mangle (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/33878) (Bear) have a 40% chance to make the next Healing Touch (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5185) or Rebirth (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20484) instant, free, and castable in all forms. Instant cast version of Healing Touch (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5185) now benefits from Attack Power instead of Spell Power.<br>

Raid Testing Schedule - August 8-9<br>
On Thursday, August 8, and Friday, August 9, we will continue testing raid encounters in the Siege of Orgrimmar raid. We&apos;re moving on to 10-player Heroic testing at this time, and then 25-player mode as the PTR cycle progresses.<br>
<br>
Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below for all Public Test Realms.<br>
<br>
Thursday, August 8<br>
Immerseus - 10 Player Heroic - 10:30 PDT (13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST)<br>
Norushen - 10 Player Heroic - 16:00 PDT (19:00 EDT, 01:00 CEST)<br>
<br>
Friday, August 9<br>
Spoils of Pandaria - 10 Player Heroic - 10:30 PDT (13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST)<br>
Paragons of the Klaxxi - 10 Player Heroic - 16:00 PDT (19:00 EDT, 01:00 CEST)<br>
<br>
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br>

Instead you did the exact opposite and went to a complete standstill. Main heroes mostly do nothing at all.<br>
Characters like Garrosh and Jaina have a lot of presence in the 5.0 story. Now, you may not like them or wish we had included more. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363732251055357952))<br>
<br>
Wotlk had the highest integration of players to the story. Cata and mop had arguably none or really week.<br>
We also heard criticism that Arthas turned up every time you opened a closet. Risked making him feel more annoying than frightening. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363731928530161664))<br>
<br>
Real question, what is the intrinsic value of content? Story/Aesthetic difficulty matters less.<br>
Seeing content and seeing story are both rewards. In WoW, gear just tends to be a more motivating reward for many. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363411281815928834))<br>
<br>
I have a feeling that y&apos;shaarj is the true baddie in this expansion amirite?<br>
He is dead. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/345673427400683520))<br>
How can Old Gods die if &quot;They&apos;re outside the cycle&quot;?<br>
&quot;What is dead may never die?&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363402324854587392))<br>
<br>
stop saying u lose a leveling zone when u can phase for hight levels like u do on Theramor<br>
Okay, so you&apos;re asking for Ashenvale to be phased at higher level to reinforce Alliance winning back some land? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363402074769207297))<br>
<br>
Just trying to understand how the ongoing story makes sense after changes such as this - esp for lower level toons<br>
We often have a problem with the lower level time flow. Arthas is dead 1-60 then alive 61-80 then dead again 80-90. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361996419105685504))<br>
Why not turn TBC &amp; WotLK into optional content that can be played in scenarios / cavern of times?<br>
It&apos;s a neat idea. It just takes designer time away from other ideas (which doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s off the table). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362359190649438209))<br>

Can we get a list of to-be-joined servers in 5.4 so we can start matching guilds/arena teams up? Thanks!<br>
There are no Arena teams any longer. We&apos;ll provide lists of connected realms when we have resolved which ones are affected. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362450562370904065))<br>
