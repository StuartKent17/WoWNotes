I didn&apos;t notice them at first but the first PTR build of Patch 3.2 was shipped with a few models of new armors. I will not claim that they are Tier 9 armors because the naming scheme of the model files was changed but it wouldn&apos;t be surprising if it was indeed the T9 models. <br>
<br>
Only the Plate version for the alliance is available for the moment. I know for sure that they&apos;re sets for different classes because the textures are clearly named after each class, see the file list (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/june/Plate_ArgentAlliance.txt). <br>
