Warlords of Draenor - All Mounts Work as Ground Mounts<br>
Almost (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/444626517629218816) all mounts will work as ground mounts in Warlords of Draenor!<br>

<br>
Warlords of Draenor Flying<br>
I&apos;ve already said that what we said at BlizzCon still holds true at current. If ongoing development changes this including testing, feedback, and etc, then we&apos;ll keep people informed. We are in the midst of development and as with anytime we get into it, we often will change design ideas or implementations from what we originally thought we wanted to do to what we believe will more likely work better. We will continue to discuss our ideas as openly as possible (as Alex did) and keep an eye out on constructive feedback. We will do our utmost to address as many concerns that people may have as possible while still keeping in mind the overall health and objectives we have for the game. <br>
<br>
We don&apos;t work in stone and design is a very fluid thing. We&apos;re going to keep moving forward toward creating fun experiences for as many people as possible. I said this over on Twitter and I&apos;ll say it again here- &quot;Sometimes I feel I need to say this, but game design decisions are not personal. They aren&apos;t meant to cause personal distress. We do care.&quot; We want to make sure that Warlords of Draenor (and the game as a whole) continues to deliver truly great experiences and plenty of fun.<br>

Battle.Net Launcher Feedback<br>
The fact that YOU think I need MY desktop &apos;cleaned up&apos; or I can&apos;t keep it organized is pretty damned infuriating and condescending, quite frankly.<br>
I don&apos;t personally care what your desktop looks like or how many icons you have on it, or if you&apos;re able or not able to keep track of them; but icons on your desktop has little-to-nothing to do with offering a unified launcher platform. You can have the Battle.net app create a desktop icon for each game still, if that&apos;s what you want to click on.<br>
<br>
Right now each of our games is started through a launcher. The launchers help ensure games are up to date, offer functionality to launch other versions (beta/PTR/etc.), has some file management tools (repair), provide quick links to helpful resources (support), and helps bring info front and center when starting a game like patch notes, game info, news, etc.<br>
<br>
Instead of having separate launchers for each game, which are individually updated and maintained, and each of which also likely having different requirements and specifics for how it works and operates, it makes a lot of sense for us to have a single platform (e.g. launcher) that brings all the games together under a single roof, streamlines our platforms, and provides a single launcher--instead of many of them--to provide the same features those launchers always have, plus more, and additional flexibility to add features into the future.<br>
<br>
If you&apos;re launching Blizzard games now, it&apos;s quite likely you&apos;re seeing a launcher, and that&apos;s not really any different than seeing the Battle.net desktop app &quot;launcher&quot;.<br>
<br>
What the heck ever happened to just double clicking the executable and running the game. That doesn&apos;t need &quot;improving.&quot;<br>
Online games, like World of Warcraft, usually require that everyone playing use the same files and file versions to ensure content parity. If you and I are playing and the information we each hold about the game differs, it becomes exceedingly difficult for the server to reconcile how those differences play out and also how the client perceives those differences. Everyone needs to be playing the same game, essentially. To help try to make that process smoother, a launcher that starts up before the game checks file versions when starting the game. If your files are not current a patch is downloaded and installed. Additionally, we&apos;ve added functionality for the launcher to download future patch data ahead of time to reduce the time required on patch day to get into the game, as well as the ability to stream game data so that the entire game doesn&apos;t need to be downloaded for new players, or those just reinstalling.<br>
<br>
World of Warcraft has had a launcher for the purposes of file version verification since at least 2003. The Battle.net desktop app is, for the purposes of this discussion, an updated launcher.<br>
<br>
However: I recommend Blizzard create a list of offline games to play specifically during patch downloads.<br>
If you used the launcher you&apos;d have downloaded the patch data well in advance, and wouldn&apos;t need to wait.<br>
<br>
Just don&apos;t make the battle.net app mandatory in the future. I like double clicking the WoW icon from my desktop to launch WoW. Kthxbai.<br>
You can still do that with the Battle.net app. Cya.<br>

PvP<br>
is tyrannical gear, for those who like it as x-mog, never to be obtainable again? strange: all other MoP pvp gear is available<br>
It will become available again on a vendor in a future patch. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438456348359942144))<br>
<br>
Why the change to feats for PVP titles? Are they going to be permanent now or something?<br>
We&apos;ve made technical changes to how we deliver rewards and we added a Feat of Strength. Titles are still temporary. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438429141054914560))<br>
IE feats stay, but after a season you lose the title it grants.<br>
Yes you keep the achievement but lose the title. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438441521663070208))<br>
Are the feats permanent, though? Do they stay as &apos;proof&apos; of your accomplishment for the season? Or gone in S16.<br>
You will always have the achievement that says &quot;Season 14&quot; (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438441083521859584))<br>
<br>
season 15? .............15.......I&apos;ve been playing this game for too long.<br>
Yeah, we have been talking about that. The numbers are getting high enough that players are often confused about what season it is. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438440704491003904))<br>
<br>
So if we&apos;re getting 3 new world bosses, which are dropping the PvP gear?<br>
We&apos;re still sorting that out. A lot of things are going to be different. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438019686647623680))<br>
Also keep in mind there were multiple world bosses at MoP launch as well. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438019825210642432))<br>
Should be a chest in a FFA zone somewhere with PvP item in it with a long respawn time.(wtbgurubashi)<br>
Agree it would be fun to so more of this sort of thing (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438060632248573952))<br>
By &quot;FFA&quot; you mean &quot;come with the most friends so you can solo loot the chest,&quot; right?<br>
World PvP, it can be pretty mean. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438224618306797568))<br>
<br>
any plans for fixing Wintergrasp and Tol Barad for Warlords?<br>
Not at this point. The best thing to do would be convert them to battlegrounds, but it requires significant work. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438023758880600064))<br>

What happened to expanding the Darkmoon Faire? All those unused tents depress me....<br>
Me too. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/431992383958294528))<br>
Any plans?<br>
Yes. But my purple octopus monster hat-dropping world boss didn&apos;t make it in yet, either, so who knows when. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/433446148364177408))<br>
<br>
So tabards... Are they likely to get a tab? If not, can Scarlet Tabard be added to the vendor for my other toons?<br>
Maybe! And I believe the vendor only covers achievement/perma-lost tabards, not bought or mob-dropped (Heroic Harlan has it). (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/433445708901781504))<br>
