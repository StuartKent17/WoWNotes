Design was changed ... a lot. This will allow us to add more :
Green, because it's a nice color.
Content, dynamic menus are gonna make life easier.
Advertising, no reason to not speak about it, hosting a site isn't free, and more money will be needed for the next features.



During the next days, I'll try to change all the images from the old design most of them are already changed, and I'll start updating the static content if Blizzard is nice enough to hold the patch a few more days.
