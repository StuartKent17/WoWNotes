Dungeon Finder and Gear Detection<br>
We would love to implement better ways for Dungeon Finder to detect if players know what they&apos;re doing in dungeons beyond just the gear they&apos;ve accumulated. We have some long-term design goals in mind for this we&apos;re not quite prepared to share this early on though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/149061/dungeon-queue-should-be-performance-based))<br>
<br>
Why did we die?<br>
One flaw with the current system, is if players fail in a pick-up group, they aren&apos;t told why they failed. People then tend to play the blame game, often directing malice at the healer(s).<br>
<br>
So while I&apos;m speaking more about class roles, I think the idea still lends itself to your question. It&apos;d be helpful to get more information than just through trial and error. Groups could benefit if they knew they didn&apos;t wipe because the healer didn&apos;t manage mana well enough, but because the DPS wasn&apos;t high enough, or boss adds weren&apos;t properly rounded up, etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/149061/dungeon-queue-should-be-performance-based))<br>
