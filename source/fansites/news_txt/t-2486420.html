Absorbs no longer prevent dazing?<br>
With mount equipment coming to Patch 8.2 Rise of Azshara, we&apos;ve noticed that absorbs no longer prevent a player from being dazed and being dismounted while being melee hit from the back.<br>
<br>
Yeah okay, exactly why change something that hasn&#x2019;t been a bad thing since, what, Vanilla? Why take away one of the few ways non-tanks can prevent being Dazed that doesn&#x2019;t involve shelling out gold? If Resounding Protection was such a problem then change the trait to no longer prevent dazing. Messing with our Absorbs from spells is wholly unnecessary. What was so broken about it that it was perfectly fine gameplay for over a decade?<br>
This change was not intended. We&#x2019;re investigating the issue and plan to fix it in the Rise of Azshara PTR as soon as possible.<br>
