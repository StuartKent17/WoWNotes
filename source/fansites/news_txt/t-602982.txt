Boubouille2007-11-01, 06:46 AMChanges to Alterac Valley mines in 2.3
More changes will be made to Alterac Valley in 2.3, and Salthem explains why mines are going to be more useful.
Just as a quick update to this, I have updated the opening post with some further changes planned for the 2.3.0 PTR:
If a side controls a mine, then every 45 seconds they will gain 1 supply. If they control both mines, then they'll get 2.
No side can ever have more than the max number of supplies currently the max is 600
The Herald yell text for taking a mine includes a line about getting reinforcements for owning it.
The 45-second ticker is on an independent timer i.e. the first "+" a side gets for controlling a mine won't be 45 seconds after they take it. It'll be somewhere between 1 and 45 seconds -- whenever the ticker ticks. 

OMG Void Reaver down in 53 seconds !
You probably heard about a Void Reaver kill http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/vr53.jpg performed in 53 seconds with the help of a particular monster Let's call him Mr. Smith. Even if it looks fun, I could be a good idea to not do it if you don't want to make some GMs very sad, thanks for them.

Wrath of the Lich King
Naxxramas has been added to WotLK because it fitted very well with the story of Wrath of the Lich King. This is an exception and there probably won't be any more dungeons updated to provide a challenge for higher levels.

Wintersabers faction changed in 2.3
First, keep in mind that this is a PTR change and maybe it won't affect live servers when the patch is released, but it seems that the reputation with Wintersabers Trainers will be much easier to grind in 2.3, the reputation awarded by repeatable quests has been changed from 75 to 250.
