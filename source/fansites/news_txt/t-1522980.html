Asking again b/c you said it&apos;s okay: Is the goal of Resolve to keep defensive &amp; healing abilities exactly as strong as now?<br>
I wouldn&apos;t say the same as &apos;now&apos; (meaning live). Tank AM *gameplay* is awesome, but its *effectiveness* is too strong on live. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466841403721388032))<br>
And yes, those things are quite connected. We just want to skew toward tanks needing more external healing than they do today. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466841685746413568))<br>

Shame about no Dread Raven, because those are the coolest birds I&apos;ve seen in WoW. At least we know Chimeras maybe? How come maybe?<br>
Lots of new stuff in Draenor (ravager, bat, boar, etc.), some things might warrant a cool quest/drop (like dinomancy/rhok&apos;delar) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/466744423058276352))<br>
<br>
Since you&apos;re talking about hunter pets a bit, PLEASE tell me we can tame talbuks! You&apos;ll make my day! Week even!<br>
Not at the moment, open to the idea but it&apos;s a snowball of ungulates. Ungulate is an awful name for a family too. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/466743883121315840))<br>
<br>
Will MM Hunters be losing Master Marksman? If not, how will it interact with Focusing Shot?<br>
No, Master Marksman stays, and does interact with Focusing Shot. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467058083496071168))<br>

Second: Why not allow Surging Mist to generate 1 Chi for Windwalker? Serious question. I understand why not for Brewmaster.<br>
It&apos;s definitely less clear for WW than BM, as you say. It&apos;s something we&apos;re considering, but not sure. Generating 1 may be OK, ... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466842100487581697))<br>
...because that&apos;s still a significant loss compared to the 2 chi from Jab. We&apos;re still evaluating that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466842308038520833))<br>
<br>
Finally: Will Fists of Fury&apos;s AP snapshotting stay? It doesn&apos;t snapshot TeB, which makes it weird, so that&apos;s why I&apos;m asking.<br>
Don&apos;t think so; I think it&apos;s going to be totally dynamic. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466842475529654274))<br>
<br>
Why do Healing Spheres still exist as an object? Mobility is being tuned down in WoD making picking them up even more punitive.<br>
You still get the healing even if they&apos;re not picked up, making them not punitive. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466877630499667968))<br>

Holy Shield Update? When i saw it in vanilla, as a d2 fan i was so happy! Can&apos;t wait for its glorious (and useful) return!<br>
We actually were running the numbers and found that at 10%, it&apos;s not really that far off of our targets. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466812061729558528))<br>
So then is gladiator stance over tuned? 10% block=3% phys damage reduction. How does that compare vs 5% total damage reduction?<br>
10% block is &gt;3% damage reduction. (Not that we necessarily balance Pally talents vs Warrior talents, but these should be similar.) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466816910672134144))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
will 4/4 upgraded legendary cloaks proc more often?<br>
Nope. Lots of stats though. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466772941892775936))<br>
<br>
why was the choice made to display tooltips for CDR trinks as &apos;cooldown recovery rate&apos;? very unintuitive for the players.<br>
We actually show both forms of it in 6.0, for that reason. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466811918066274305))<br>
<br>
why not have multi gear equip slots for multi specs(resto/dps/tank) that is going to save a lot of bag space?<br>
We&apos;re making changes to make most gear sharable between specs, including cross-primarystat. Check out the patch notes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466814771212201984))<br>
I&apos;m not sure if this was shared anywhere, but is it intended that tier gear still remains unique and spec specific?<br>
No, tier gear is shared across specs too. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466838985503801344))<br>
<br>
Since valor is being removed. How is the system going to adjust so very unlucky people get gear? coins don&apos;t help very unlucky<br>
Just because there&apos;s no &quot;valor&quot; doesn&apos;t mean there won&apos;t be alternate sources of gear, including vendors. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466989347066372096))<br>
<br>
Achievements<br>
So much for Bigger Bag not being able to be account wide eh?No seriously. THANK YOU.<br>
There were technical hurdles, but they were worth clearing to solve a major point of frustration for players. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466779902034071554))<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br>
Will the MS stat work on bleeds the same way it works on dot ticks/ignite ticks, double the tick but not the whole dot debuff?<br>
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467035074802614272))<br>

Patch 5.4.8 Hotfixes - May 21<br>
Battlegrounds and Arenas<br>
<br>
Resolved an issue where the Rated Battleground flag carrier debuff functioned incorrectly. Characters in a Tanking specialization should now correctly take 50% additional damage while carrying a flag in a Rated Battleground.<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Replica General&apos;s Leather Treads (http://www.wowdb.com/items/77904-replica-generals-leather-treads) no longer increases the duration of Sprint in Arenas or Rated Battlegrounds.<br>
Burden of Eternity (http://www.wowdb.com/items/103982-burden-of-eternity) may no longer be used while inside a Heroic Dungeon, Raid, or Scenario.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bug Fixes<br>
<br>
Resolved an issue where Feats of Strength for Collector&apos;s Edition: Dread Raven and Collector&#x2019;s Edition: Dread Hatchling were not being correctly awarded to players.<br>
Resolved an issue where players transitioning from Eastern Plaguelands into Ghostlands while on certain flying mounts would be unable to resummon the mount until the they relog back in.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rated Battleground Flag Carrier Hotfixes<br>
We&#x2019;ve recently identified an issue that was causing the Rated Battleground flag carrier debuff to function incorrectly. Under normal circumstances, non-tank flag carriers in Warsong Gulch and Twin Peaks should take 20% additional damage, and tank-specced flag carriers should take 50% additional damage. Currently, that debuff is only increasing damage to tank-specced players by 20%. We&#x2019;re in the process of applying a hotfix that will, once again, cause tank-specced players to take 50% increased damage when carrying the flag. This hotfix will be applied as soon as possible, and will not require realm restarts to activate.<br>
<br>
In addition, we&#x2019;re working on expanding that functionality to orb carriers in Rated Temple of Kotmogu, and cart carriers in Rated Deepwind Gorge. In Temple of Kotmogu, we&#x2019;ll be increasing the extra damage taken while carrying the orb to 50% if the player has chosen a tank specialization. In Deepwind Gorge, we&#x2019;ll be applying the same debuff used in Warsong Gulch and Twin Peaks. Cart carriers who have chosen a DPS or healing specialization will take 20% increased damage, while cart carriers who have chosen a tank specialization will take 50% increased damage. These changes will not be applied until next week&#x2019;s realm maintenance.<br>
<br>
These mechanics and changes are exclusive to Rated Battlegrounds. They will not be applied to non-Rated BGs.<br>
<br>
One addition: why not EOTS? We can still hold flags there with no debuff.<br>
We don&apos;t think the same debuff is the best solution for Eye of the Storm, but we are considering some other potential options. We agree that turtling with the flag doesn&apos;t result in the best gameplay.<br>
