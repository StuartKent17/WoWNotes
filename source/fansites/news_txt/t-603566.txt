2.3.2 Updated Notes
Yesterday I posted the most important updates of the patch notes but it was a bit of a mess with the Dreamhack still running. Here are the fully updated patch notes, with a few additions and link to the "unofficial" changes for more details. Shaman spells mana costs, rogues and druids upgrades

Keep in mind that the undocumented changes aren't official yet and could be changed.

x - Undocumented changes
1 - Added in 11/30 Update. 

General
/timetest is a command that can be run to provide information on game performance. /timetest 0 turns the command off. When the command is issued, the next time a player uses a flight master to travel, certain statistics will be measured and displayed at the end of that flight. All weather effects and spawns are shutdown during the test.
1 Effects triggered from being critically hit: Many abilities and talents were changed in 2.3.0 to allow them to trigger from critical strikes that occurred while the player benefitting from them was sitting.
Quest givers with blue question marks no longer show up on the minimap.
NPC's who you have completed a quest for will display a question mark on mouseover rather than an exclamation point.
The bank controls for the guildmaster level of a guild is now grayed out. A guildmaster always has full access to a guild bank and this cannot be changed.
A "Withdraw-Repair Only" button has been added to the guild bank controls. If this is set for a guild rank, then that rank cannot actually withdraw funds from the guild bank, but they can still use that daily amount of money for repairs.
You will now automatically stand up when attacked, even if the attack doesn’t land.



Druids
x Ravage All ranks - Damage have been changed from 350% to 385%
1 Lifebloom: When this ability is refreshed it will take on the strength of the incoming Lifebloom effect, rather than maintain the existing strength.

Rogues
x Ambush All Ranks - Damage changed from 250% to 275%
Cheat Death: When multiple attacks land simultaenously, all those resolved after the attack which triggered Cheat Death will now have their damage reduced by 90% as intended. However, the combat log will still report them doing full damage.
Hemorrhage: Rank 4 of this ability no longer has its charges consumed by non-physical attacks and spells.
1 Hemorrhage weapon damage reduced from 125% to 110%, but the damage debuff has been increased.
1 Shadowstep now awards 1 combo point.
