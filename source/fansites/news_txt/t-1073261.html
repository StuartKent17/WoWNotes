Ever wondered which pets or mounts you&apos;re missing and where to get them? Time to get Collectinator (Download (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/collectinator)). This is a simple to use addon that will help you figure that out.<br>
<br>
You open the addon on the pet or mount page in your spellbook by clicking scan (top right). This will determine what pets or mounts you currently have and what you are missing. Once Collectinator is open you can also click on the top left icon to switch between pets and mounts.<br>
<br>
In the filter menu you have options such as faction, known/unknown, drop type (instance, raid, quest, crafted, mob drop, achievement, vendor &amp; pvp) as well as include or exclude special/world event, collector&apos;s editions and the WoW trading card game. You can choose to filter BoA, BoE or BoP, select by how rare the item is and what expansion it comes from. You can also search by name if looking for something specific.<br>
<br>
Expanding the item shows the location, including co-ordinates and a mouseover will select the item and shows more detailed information.<br>
<br>
Whilst you&apos;ve got the item highlighted you have the following options - add/remove this item from your ignore list, link the item into your chat and with TomTom (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tomtom)integration - the option to add the item to the map and mini-map for tracking. <br>
<br>
Whether you&apos;re looking for a cool new pet or mount, a serious collector working towards Littlest Pet Shop (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5875/littlest-pet-shop/) or Mountain o&apos; Mounts (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/2536/mountain-o-mounts/), or looking ahead to pet battles in Mists of Pandaria (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1062458-Mists-of-Pandaria-Pet-Battles-Blue-Posts-Fan-Art-Curse-Weekly-Roundup), this addon will make it easy to find those pets and mounts.<br>

New Lore: Lor&apos;themar Theron Story Now Available!<br>
Blizzard Entertainment is proud to present the latest entry in the &quot;Leaders of Azeroth&quot; short story series: In the Shadow of the Sun! (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/leader-story/lorthemar-theron/1)<br>
<br>
Lor&apos;themar (http://www.wowpedia.org/Lor%27themar_Theron) was not any surer of his thoughts by the day Aethas was scheduled to arrive. As he made his way through Sunfury Spire to the front hall where the archmage would appear, Halduron stopped him, holding out a small bundle of soft crimson wool. Lor&apos;themar took it and held it up as it unfolded, beholding a regal golden phoenix upon its field: the Silvermoon City tabard.<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; he said curtly, shoving the garment back at his friend.<br>
<br>
&quot;You should wear it,&quot; Halduron pressed.<br>
<br>
&quot;What does it matter?&quot; he answered, striding forward. &quot;Anyone in the service of Silvermoon may bear it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It is the symbol of state,&quot; Halduron called after him. &quot;You are the head of state. You should look the part.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am the regent lord,&quot; Lor&apos;themar said, continuing to walk away. &quot;Not the king.&quot; <br>
