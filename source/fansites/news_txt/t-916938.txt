World of Warcraft 64-bit client soon?
According to the latest changes in the interface files of the Patch 4.2 PTR client, it seems that Blizzard is finally getting ready to release a 64-bit version of the WoW client.


GlueStrings.lua
if  IsWindowsClient  then
if  Is64BitClient  then
dllURL = SCANDLL_URL_WIN64_SCAN_DLL;
else
dllURL = SCANDLL_URL_WIN32_SCAN_DLL;
end
end

AccountLogin.lua
SCANDLL_URL_WIN32_SCAN_DLL = "http://us.scan.worldofwarcraft.com/update/Scan.dll";
SCANDLL_URL_WIN64_SCAN_DLL = "http://us.scan.worldofwarcraft.com/update/Scan-64.dll";


And as I write this news post I can already see the confused look in your eye: "Wait? What? Who cares?". Well, this change means two things:



People with 64-bit Operating Systems = anyone with more than 3gb of Memory, most likely will see a slight increase in performance. 
People who regularly experiences crashes when World of Warcraft uses too much memory will finally be able to play WoW without crashing every x hours/minutes. People playing in super high resolution, or with a boatload of addons


Of course nothing is official yet, but there's a glimmer of hope for the increasing number of people with 64-bit systems. However, I'd like to point out that we're only seeing a couple of strings in .lua files and not real changes so I wouldn't expect it for Patch 4.2. 


iPhone Mobile Authenticator App Update
Due to an issue with the latest version of the iPhone Battle.net Mobile Authenticator application version 1.3.0, we've temporarily taken down the app from the iTunes store. Rest assured that we're already working on a new version and will be providing an update in this thread as soon as that new update is up. Please note that until the new version is made available, iPhone and iTouch users will be unable to download the app or upgrade it to the latest version.

If you use a non-iPhone version of the Battle.net Mobile Authenticator, have not upgraded to version 1.3.0, or if you upgraded an existing version via iTunes but have not retrieved a new serial number, your Mobile Authenticator should be unaffected by this issue and continue to function as normal. Regardless if you retrieved the update or not, there is no security threat or risk associated with the Authenticator's ability to continue protecting your account while attached.

As always, if you are experiencing any issues with an Authenticator or Mobile Authenticator, we encourage you to contact our customer support staff for assistance - https://us.battle.net/support/en/ticket/submit

Thanks!


Patch 4.2 - Memento Mori + Method vs Occu'thar Baradin Hold
Memento Mori http://wow-mm.com/ and Method http://www.methodwow.com/ teamed up on test realms to go kick Occu'thar's ... eyes. Occu'thar is the new boss of Baradin Hold and if you have no idea of what's going on in this fight, don't worry, there's a dungeon journal entry for that guy too! 

Occu'thar Baradin Hold
This ravenous demon broke free of its cage and gained access to the western wing of the prison, devouring all of the inmates held there. Occu'thar's gluttony resulted in a body too bloated to escape its environs, effectively turning the prison wing into its new holding cell. 



Focused Fire http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96884/focused-fire/ - Occu'thar sets his gaze on the location of a random player, then inflicts 35,000 Fire damage every 1 sec to players within 12 yards of the targeted location. 
Searing Shadows http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/101007/searing-shadows/ - Occu'thar inflicts 105,000 Shadow damage to players in a 60 degree cone in front of him, and increases Shadow damage taken by 100% for 30 sec. 
Eyes of Occu'thar http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96920/eyes-of-occuthar/ - Occu'thar forms an Eye of Occu'thar on every player for 10 sec. The eyes bore into their target hosts with the Gaze of Occu'thar.



Gaze of Occu'thar http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96942/gaze-of-occuthar/ - The Eye of Occu'thar gazes at its target host, inflicting 6,000 Shadow damage every 1 sec for 10 sec.
Occu'thar's Destruction http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96968/occuthars-destruction/ - After an Eye of Occu'thar remains attached to a player for 10 sec, it fully bores into the host and detonates with Occu'thar's Destruction, inflicting 25,000 Shadow damage on all players.
