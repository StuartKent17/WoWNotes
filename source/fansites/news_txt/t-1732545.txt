Blue Tweets
PvP
I spent an hour and a half in Ashran and got one box, a couple hundred honor, and zero conquest points. It sucked. A lot.
Thanks for the feedback and for presenting it reasonably. holinka 

I'm not sure how to feel about the Ashran change. When events appear my team is overrun instantly and we have to wait for the next.
now that the queue times are under control, we may lower the player cap in Ashran. It would help the overwhelming force problem. holinka 
won't use personal account to speak about wow issues...... Unless it's ashran or to promote pvp tournaments cause pvp is fine lol
Yes I will continue to promote WoW and PvP through Twitter. No I won't discuss design issues. Thanks for catching me on that. holinka 

Garrisons
Love the Garrison Jukebox, but I thought Portable Audiophone would work more like an iPod. I need a jukebox for the mine/town hall
The idea of an in-game music player that picks from any available track is kind of a cool idea, right? Muffinus 
That would be amazing. I rarely mute the in game music, but I get super nostalgic to hear the old tracks now and then.
The track that plays when you enter the imp area of molten core before the first boss is my jam. Muffinus 

Misc
Has the hate really even that bad on your end? I know it's wow pvp but you seem more withdrawn on twitter regarding WoW.
We decided to have all WoW discussions from and not our personal twitter accounts. holinka 


Computers - Setup of the Month
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices  are trending slightly downward again over the past few months, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. 

New GPUs from AMD may be coming in the second half of this year, but no official announcements have been made. 

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 4790K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions!
