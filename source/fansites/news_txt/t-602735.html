It took some time to have something working, but we can now provide you a decent list of the low level dungeon loot changes ! Basically, the PTR tooltip is on the left, the Live tooltip on the right, all the relevant item changes (Unique items becoming Unique-equipped, and sometimes +healing changed into +healing and 33% damage are excluded). Sometimes the version won&apos;t show up, it&apos;s a known bug but it&apos;s not really a problem. Example : [compare=32254,en,wh,2.3.0 (PTR);en,eu,2.2.3 (Live)]<br>
