Patch 8.2 PTR - Anglers' Water Striders
For those of you who own a water strider mount, you will receive a Anglers' Water Striders https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168416-anglers-water-striders from Nat Pagle in the mail upon logging in after Patch 8.2 goes live. 


This new mount equipment can be slotted into your mount equipment slot to let all your mounts walk on water. 
Your water strider will no longer be able to walk on water without this slotted.
This item is consumed when you replace it with a new piece of equipment in the mount equipment slot and needs to be purchased and slotted again to gain the effect.
If you own a water strider, you can head to The Anglers in Krasarang Wilds and purchase a new one from Nat Pagle for 40 gold.
Currently, there is no option to purchase this from Nat Pagle in your garrison.
