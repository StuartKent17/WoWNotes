Boubouille2007-12-13, 12:58 AMBlue posts ! News everywhere ! And in case you didn't notice the website downtime has been postponed because of a small issue, but now you're warned that the website might be down for an hour at some point.

Update : Due to some techical issues, the new PTR build won't be tonight.

Premades on 2.3.2 PTR
It looks like more people are needed on PTRs, premade characters are now active !
We are activating pre-made characters for the PTR starting today December 12th. Once the servers are up you will be able to copy pre-made characters via the PTR character copy page 4 per account. I suggest waiting before initiating character copies until the servers are up as there is no guarantee that they will go through and there are no refunds for lost pre-mades.

We expect demand for pre-mades and the Test Realms to be very high, I would highly suggest transferring your characters to both PTRs as the PVP realm typically has a high queue time. There is no plan to add a second PVP realm.

All characters are equipped with Season 2 Arena gear and Heroic Badge loot. Every character also has extra heroic badges to purchase additional gear. Beyond that no gear changes will be made so don’t even ask.

Posts about premades, for or against will be deleted. Premades are activated based on QA testing needs not by request of players.

Other announcements
The PTR authentication servers were not updated between 2.3 and 2.3.2, meaning that if your password changed or if your account was otherwise invalid prior to October 8th you will not be eligible for the 2.3.2 PTR.


Summoning disabled in ZA, might be activated in all dungeons from outside later
Warlocks will probably be very happy with this one, raids too I guess. 
We had to disable summoning Note: In ZA yesterday via emergency hotfix due to some exploits. We're hoping to re-enable summoning as soon as possible. We know it's a big inconvenience and we apologize.

On a related note, we're looking into fixing some issues with summoning that would once again enable us to allow warlocks to summon people into an instance from anywhere in the world. This could happen as soon as the next big content patch 2.4.0 if all of the technical issues can be resolved by then.


Eyonix posts on rogues
Eyonix made a few posts about the changes to hemorrhage and the future of the Subtetly talent tree.
Hemorrhage was intended to give heavy subtlety rogues some added damage, and to give the overall tree some additional appeal. Instead, many rogues just went down to the new hemo and ignored the rest. Our goal now is to make further improvements to the tree as a whole, so it has enough appeal and viability to compete with combat and assassination. Major changes will likely not come before the expansion, but we are looking in to more immediate tweaks as well.

We want there to be more subtlety rogues, and we’re working to improve the tree. One way was to give the tree more damage, through hemorrhage. Unfortunately, that didn’t really improve the tree because everyone just stopped with the AR/Prep spec. What resulted was an increased power of the rogue class as a whole not just the subtlety spec, which was unintended.

European Realms : Free character migration
Due to population differences between some of the highest and lowest populated PvP realms, the following Free Character Migration will be available December 12th to 18th:

From: Al'Akir, Burning Legion, Magtheridon, Shadowmoon, Stormscale
To: Burning Blade, Jaedenar, Mazrigos, Spinebreaker

Additionally, to alleviate queues on Stonemaul and Warsong we have opened a new realm and free character migration from currently only those two realms to this new one. This migration is planned for the same dates as above.
The name of the new realm is Molten Core, and it’s in the Nightfall Battlegroup. Character creation on the realm will be disabled during the migration, except for those having a character there.

From: Stonemaul, Warsong
To: Molten Core new realm

Please note that the migration may be closed at any time should a destination realm's population rise too high.

Tales of the Past III
Well ... What can I say except download it now ? That's probably the biggest video work ever done on WoW, and it looks damn nice, and if you want three reasons to download it : Ashbringer, Northrend, Female Night Elves in tight armors.
