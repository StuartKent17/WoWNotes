Launcher Conflict<br>
We are aware of a bug that is causing the Launcher to create copies of itself if you launch World of Warcrat through the Steam client. We are in the process of addressing this bug, and in the meantime, we ask that you avoid launching World of Warcraft from Steam. Thank you for your patience while we work to address this issue. <br>

Europe - Performance since Saturday<br>
During the maintenance in the morning of Saturday January 24th we did some tweaks to the load balancing for continents, raids and instances. While our continual monitoring of the realms do show improvements, we would also like to hear your personal experiences since Saturday. Please note that these tweaks deal with the performance itself, not the &quot;additional instances cannot be launched&#x201D; matter.<br>
<br>
If you would please reply to this thread with a description of your game performance experience since Saturday morning, that would be greatly appreciated. Please include which realm you play on and what game content your feedback is about; raids, 5-man instances, Lake Wintergrasp, or other outdoor content (please specify which continent, e.g. Northrend).<br>
<br>
Thank you in advance. <br>

Burst damage in PvP<br>
We have said we think burst is too high in PvP and we are working on changes. You can come up with different theories for why different classes are doing so well in PvP at the moment. Arcane mages can do a lot of damage in very few GCDs. Rogues can do a lot of damage quickly to CC&apos;d targets. Death knights (probably more so before 3.0.8 ) had a lot of suvivability and paladins still have a lot of survivability.<br>
<br>
We don&apos;t want to announce changes here and there throughout various forum threads. When we are ready to announce the changes, you won&apos;t miss them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14637455103-can-we-please.html))<br>

Tanking Stats<br>
Having more tanking stats for druids to care about is still something we are working on. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14595050269-druid-tanking-gear.html))<br>

Shadow Priest in PvP<br>
We&apos;re not ready to announce specific changes yet, but shadow priest PvP survivability should definitely get a boost in 3.1. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14637455014-gc-spriest-and-priests-in-general-for-31.html))<br>

Developer Q&amp;A / Suggestions (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14595170174-ghostcrawler-just-a-few-questions-plz.html))<br>
1. are all the locks tree&apos;s getting overhauled or just the demon tree?<br>
I am reluctant to use the word &quot;overhaul&quot; because that sets up an expectation for some players that is difficult to meet. We are changing some talents and spells in all 3 trees. <br>
<br>
2. like new pets for locks plz?? its been a long time some reg summons maybe switching 41 point to infernal and making fg a reg summon? we have no reg summons for 60 ,70 and 80 we need to keep up with other classes and lets make the game more fun for the people playing years<br>
Additional demons are something we would like to do at some point, but first we want to get all the current demons useful. Hunters have a lot more flexibility in which pet they pick. Locks need certain demons for certain jobs and we&apos;re not convinced yet that they are all there (particularly that female one). <br>
<br>
3. can we get a perma metamorph with a few nerfs for the QQers or will we have something new ? <br>
We think we have enough instances of characters turning into other forms already. <br>
<br>
3. faster dots? or cutting the dot timers down to make it seem like burst damage ? <br>
Adding some on-deamnd burst damage for locks is something we are looking at. <br>
<br>
4. maybe enslave demon being perma to kinda customize locks like the hunters ..im not asking to be as uber as hunters pets but we should almost match them since they are pet/burst class and we are pet/dot class <br>
Hunter pets are supposed to be more like life-long companions while warlocks tend to use and discard their demons as necessary. So we aren&apos;t really going for that one to one comparison. <br>
