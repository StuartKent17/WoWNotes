Zone Screenshots<br>
The screenshots of the zones are without NPCs or doodads, this isn&apos;t representative of the final instance, just a preview of the architecture. Obviously a subzone like the Throne of Apocalypse is more impressive when Cho&apos;gall is here sitting on his huge throne. <br>

UI Addon Functionality Returning<br>
With the release of the next beta patch, we plan to re-enable the ability for players to use third-party addons. Many of the core user interface features are now implemented in the beta test and functional, so we feel it&#x2019;s a good time to open up the field for developing and testing UI modifications.<br>
<br>
Be sure to continue leaving us feedback about all of the new user interface features here: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=26560766722&amp;sid=2000<br>
<br>
Feedback about the new guild interface can be provided to us here: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=26560766721&amp;sid=2000 <br>

We Are Legendary - Retroactive!<br>
We are making a exception for this guild achievement. Any legendary items you have already earned will count. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560536194/question-on-we-are-legenday/))<br>
<br>
New content for the next Beta Patch<br>
We do not plan to patch today, though we plan to have a great deal of new content in the upcoming patch. You&apos;ll get access to new zones and dungeons, and potentially an increase in level cap to 85. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560839916/goblins-patch-today/))<br>

Feral Q&amp;A<br>
Can you make savage roar undispellable? <br>
This is something we&apos;re discussing, but haven&apos;t made a decision yet. <br>
<br>
Will Shred ever have no positional? : \ <br>
We like Shred and Backstab with positional requirements. We haven&apos;t changed our stance on this. If you find Shred too difficult to use in PvE, then Mangle. If you&apos;re not happy in PvE with the damage you can do while Mangling, and can&apos;t manage to stay in a position where you can Shred, then I hate to say it but this probably isn&apos;t the spec for you. In PvP we think it&apos;s more of an issue, but we&apos;ve also buffed Mangle to where you can do credible damage with it. <br>
<br>
Will dash be given the same treatment as sprint? (lower CD lower dura) <br>
We think Dash is fine. <br>
<br>
Is the new version of innervate intended to be worth less to specs with small mana pools like Feral? <br>
Yes, exactly. In Cataclysm, healer mana matters a great deal. In that environment, having some dps who can prop up healer mana so well is quite overpowered. It&apos;s okay to have utility in providing the healers extra mana, but it can&apos;t get out of control. Balance and Resto druids will have bigger Innervates, but then they are also balanced around needing to use those on themselves most of the time. <br>
<br>
Can you change the new version of survival instincts to have less of an effect but a shorter CD?, 60% is great, but at a 5 min cd, id rather have 40% on a 3 minute cd or something to that effect ya know? <br>
This is the kind of thing we&apos;re still messing with. There are situations where the short cooldown weaker version is more useful and others where it isn&apos;t. <br>
<br>
Is Bear form damage going to be a little bit higher then it currently is for Cata? can pulverize and mangle at least hit harder then maul? its kinda lame that our talented abilities hit much weaker then maul in bear atm :( <br>
I wouldn&apos;t worry too much about numbers yet. We haven&apos;t made much of an effort to adjust them and won&apos;t until we&apos;re happy with the basic mechanics. <br>
<br>
What is the purpose of thorns? you&apos;ve been consolidating weird buffs so, i figure this is on the list of weird buffs with no real purpose<br>
We think it has more of a purpose with more damage packed into a smaller window than weak damage available 100% of the time. In the latter case you&apos;d never think twice about attacking someone with Thorns because it&apos;s never not there. It also asks a little more of the druid to use Thorns at the right time rather than just whenever the buff drops off. Thorns isn&apos;t a raid buff on the scale of something like Fortitude or Bloodlust so we see no reason to consolidate it. <br>

Crusader Strike<br>
I see this comment a lot, but I don&apos;t understand it. Can you explain to me why a 4.4 Crusader Strike is not strictly better than a 4.5 Crusader Strike? That might be the case if your rotation was so jam packed that you can&apos;t fit in another Crusader Strike until its cooldown drops by an entire 1.5 global cooldown, but we&apos;ve gone on record saying that the rotation won&apos;t work that way. Hitting Crusader Strike even a fraction of a second sooner means a Templar&apos;s Verdict comes that sooner, letting you start the rotation again. That&apos;s a dps increase.<br>
<br>
Haste is valuable above and beyond the Sanctity of Battle talent of course. Swinging more often is a dps increase alone, and can also lead to more frequent Art of War procs or Seal ticks.<br>
<br>
Templar&apos;s Verdict at less than 3 stacks will almost never make sense unless you&apos;re in a situation where perhaps someone is running away (and for whatever reason you can&apos;t stun them etc.) so you might as well hit them now.

Lightwell Feedback Needed<br>
While any kind of feedback is helpful to a degree, we are much more interested in the feedback of players who have tried Lightwell in the most recent beta builds than those who just never cared for the talent. We are actively making changes to the spell to see how it plays, so it&apos;s important for us to know if the changes are noticeable and fun without that feedback getting buried under the cruft of bad reputation that Lightwell has built up over time. If it&apos;s still not cutting it, we&apos;re prepared to try something different, but we need a chance to see if that is in fact the case.
