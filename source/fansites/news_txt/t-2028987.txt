PvP Stat Templates and Spell Multipliers July 15th, 2016
One of the exciting things for PvP in Legion is all of the extra PvP specific tuning functionality we've added to the game. A lot of this is new technology to WoW so we've been working out the kinks as we approach beta. Unfortunately, one of the parts of the system we weren't able to get implemented in time for Legion was a way to make these values transparent to you in-game. It's something we're working on, but felt getting behind-the-scenes functionality out for launch was very important.

We'd like to share a lot of the tuning values with you here to help you understand what adjustments have been made. We're certainly open to feedback and refinement of these values.

To get started, every character entering a PvP instance has a base template of stats that is scaled to a target item level. For simplicity sake, we're going to focus here on level 110 values which budget players at item level 850. Based on our experience in beta, we felt the ratio of damage to health was a bit high, so this set of stats has a bit less primary stat and a bit more stamina that someone would in 850 gear.

Primary Stat Agility, Intellect, Strength: 11475
Secondary Stat Mastery, Critical Strike, Haste, Versatility: 4079
Stamina: 22000

For each spec, these stats are adjusted up or down by a multiplier that defaults to 1.0 or 100%. For example, casters like mages and warlocks and healers do not benefit from the damage values on their weapons, so additional primary stat is budgeted on weapons throughout the game. Accordingly, all caster classes have a primary stat multiplier of 1.55 in PvP. This represents a 55% increase in Intellect for these specs. 

We also have a blanket "Mod Damage Done" aura on all of the PvP templates for when we want to reduce damage but not primary stat. Healers are the best application of this aura. We may want to buff a Restoration Shaman's healing output, but we don't want their lava bursts to hit like trucks. Currently, all healers have a 25% reduction in damage against other players. Discipline Priests are the only exception as doing damage is part of how they heal.

Also, for individual spells, we can increase or decrease their effect while in PvP combat. This includes PvP instances like battlegrounds and arenas, but also World PvP and duels. If we want to decrease the amount of healing that Death Strike does in PvP by half, we set the PvP multiplier of that effect to 0.5.

Below is a comprehensive list of template adjustments and PvP multipliers on spells currently in Legion. We hope you find this information helpful. We're discussing ways to make it more transparent in the game but in the meantime, we're also exploring ways to maintain it somewhere on our forums.

Havoc Demon Hunter Feedback -- Legion Beta Feedback
This is minutiae, so ignore it if it doesn't make sense to you, but since this edge case has gotten so much focus and discussion:

Demonic is not intended to give you more than 5s of functional Metamorphosis time after the moment the Eye Beam channel ends. In certain cases when you cancel Eye Beam early, when it resets the Metamorphosis duration to 5s, a minor bug is causing it to set the duration to a slightly higher amount typically something like 5.7s. While it's not clear that this results in a DPS gain even when the GCD timing happens to allow for one extra Annihilation, we're looking to clean it up to avoid any misperceptions.

Feral Druid Feedback -- Legion Beta Feedback
A recent tuning hotfix shifted a significant amount of damage from Shred and Ferocious Bite into Rake and Rip. There are a number of other changes that go along with it, to balance the value of talents and traits and boost the value of the haste. Can get to more detail next week, although I imagine you'll see spell data on Tuesday anyway.

Feral Affinity will likely have to be adjusted again, both to account for this although the net damage change shouldn't be huge, and to deal with a bug whereby it's not properly increasing the damage of Rake and Rip.
