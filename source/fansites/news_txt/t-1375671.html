BlizzCon Live Raid: Method vs. Midwinter<br>
At BlizzCons past, the World of Warcraft Live Raid has proven to be a spectacle of pure entertainment and roar-inducing gameplay mastery. BlizzCon 2013&#x2019;s live raid challenge is sure to be no exception with #1-worldwide ranked 25-player Horde guild Method (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/twisting-nether/Method/rating.tier16_25) (EU-Twisting Nether) squaring off against #1-worldwide ranked 25-player Alliance guild Midwinter (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/sargeras/Midwinter/rating.tier16_25) (US-Sargeras). These two teams of exceptionally skilled raiders will be racing through 25-player Heroic Siege of Orgrimmar to tackle five encounters that will make for an especially exciting spectator experience. The winning guild will be the first to best all five, including Sha of Pride, the Kor&#x2019;kron Dark Shaman, Malkorok, Siegecrafter Blackfuse, and the infamous Garrosh Hellscream himself.<br>
<br>
Midwinter and Method raced each other for the first time in September during Athene&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Siege (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/10893289)&#x201D; live marathon event, and while Method came out of the Throne of Thunder victorious, the deciding factor may have come early on with Midwinter&#x2019;s slightly messy handling of Jin&#x2019;rokh at the start of the race. As Method was later overcome by the unforgiving machinations of Dark Animus, and Midwinter positioned themselves to take the lead&#x2014;that is, until Dark Animus dealt equal punishment to the U.S.-based guild. When all was said and done, Ra-den fell just two minutes too late for Midwinter to claim the bragging rights that day. (Watch the full Throne of Thunder race VoD (http://youtu.be/ABZqI875gW8).)<br>
<br>
Method also claims the world-first Heroic 25-player Garrosh kill, finishing him off a mere nine days before Midwinter completed their siege on Orgrimmar. But if history is any indication for these two guilds, a single mistake in any of the five intense encounters we&#x2019;ve selected could spell defeat for either team.<br>
<br>

In addition, we&#x2019;ll have Method members Rogerbrown, Sco, and Justwait, and Midwinter members Slootbag, Dpsonroids, and Pravity leading their teams directly from the stage.<br>

Siegecrafter Blackfuse Adds Health<br>
We had made several rounds of tuning changes to the various Siege of Orgrimmar encounters late in the 5.4 PTR process, and some health adjustments that were reverted before 5.4 was released ended up resurfacing in patch 5.4.1. Apologies for the inconvenience -- this should be corrected within the next day.

Are you planning to keep the current spec and talent system in the expansion? Cause I, for one, love it!<br>
While I can&apos;t talk about future expansions, overall we are happy with the current spec and talent design. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/389859476557148161))<br>
you did especially good job with the mage 90 talents<br>
Like many of our systems, there is certainly room for improvement on specific talents. The system overall is a keeper though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/390988081349681152))<br>
<br>
The new talents are way too stripped compared to old one, it used to be fun while leveling. now it&apos;s (15 more )<br>
We think the new talents are better overall, but they do make leveling slightly less rewarding. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/390986431046234113))<br>
The question is whether talents are supposed to add max level customization or leveling rewards. We went with the former. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/390986559668752384))<br>
<br>
while the 3 or 4 people here like the new talent design the 5 million who quit didnt, as well as millions in game<br>
If something that seems so obvious to you is not obvious to others, at least consider that it, in fact, might not be true. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/390930075169738752))<br>
<br>
Flex Raiding<br>
Do you think difficulty is more appropriate or is it the flexibility. Does NM still have a place in future?<br>
Overall I think the flexibility, because there already was an easier raid version. Flex lets them run with (just) their friends. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/390985742316367872))<br>
<br>
Would you encourage players to socialize-PuG instead of LFD? Eg. offering rewards (more VP, money, drops). #warcraft<br>
We&apos;re doing that a bit already with Flex. The message we want to send is LFR is fine and good, but maybe try this other thing.... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/390942023487725568))<br>
