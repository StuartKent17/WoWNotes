Patch 6.2 - Developer Interview<br>
Vanion (http://www.vanion.eu/) had the chance to interview Ion Hazzikostas today. The more interesting points are below, but be sure to listen to the whole thing for context. <br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;120&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xpMZNb6EWfs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br>
<br>
Raiding<br>
<br>
Hellfire Citadel is more linear than Blackrock Foundry, but there is still choice and variety. Once you get to the second floor, you can choose which order you want to work on the bosses before going through Mannoroth to Archimonde. <br>
There are quests like Well of Souls (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/39500-well-of-souls) that allow you to skip part of the raid after you have killed bosses a few times.<br>
Mythic Archimonde may have some interesting, unexpected, and new things happen once he is at low health. <br>
There is no requirement to have killed Archimonde on Heroic before entering Mythic. Restrictions like this have existed in the past, but they were easily bypassed by inviting any player who had killed the boss on Heroic.<br>
When the team was planning Warlords, Grommash was set up as the leader of the Iron Horde and the final boss. As they told the story and started working on Hellfire Citadel, they decided it wouldn&apos;t be a satisfying direction to go in. Players had just finished a raid zone full of Orcs and had killed another Hellscream. The real evil and more interesting character is Gul&apos;dan and the influence of the Legion. <br>
&quot;Is Gul&apos;dan dead or alive?&quot; - &quot;That&apos;s a good question&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Legendary Items<br>
<br>
Once you have your legendary ring, the Crystallized Fel (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127785-crystallized-fel) will drop from Archimonde on Normal or greater difficulty. This will scale up the proc and stats, allowing guilds to get slightly stronger every week. <br>
The legendary quest previously required you to get 900 legendary quest items, which means you always got some from every boss. This time around, only 33 are required. This means you won&apos;t get one from every boss, which may not feel as great but it is tuned to be slightly faster than previous collection steps. <br>
Most players should be able to collect all of the Tome of Chaos (http://www.wowdb.com/items/127115-tome-of-chaos) in a month or so.<br>
Raid loot from Garrison missions was exciting, but it devalued participation in the actual raids and undercut the reward structure. When guilds finally moved into Mythic Blackrock Foundry later in the raiding cycle, they already had several Mythic items from garrison missions already, so it wasn&apos;t as rewarding as it should have been.<br>
The bosses that dropped tokens in previous tiers dropped too many loot items in total, as the token items were separate from the normal loot. The team changed how the tier tokens were dropped in Patch 6.2, but by the time they realized bosses were not dropping enough tokens it was too late. It will be hotfixed for the new raid reset.<br>
Figuring out how old style legendary items would fit into current itemization, class balance, and how the game works today is challenging. Creating a legendary weapon that only works for some classes and specs wouldn&apos;t work well. <br>
<br>
<br>
Timewalking<br>
<br>
Timewalker dungeons are tuned to be easier on purpose, but part of the problem is that classes have so many more capabilities now. <br>
The old Shattered Halls could have a Prot Warrior tank who has no AoE threat, just tab Sundering. Situations like that made the dungeons more challenging. Most people didn&apos;t have AoE and AoE threat, so tanks couldn&apos;t hold threat on all of the mobs at the same time, making CC necessary.<br>
Some of the Timewalking dungeons are a little bit too easy right now, such as Black Morass. Arcatraz is tuned a little bit better. <br>
The team would like to expand Timewalking to Cataclysm dungeons, as well as expanding the number of dungeons covered by the system in Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King.<br>
Figuring out where Timewalking raids would fit in the reward structure is a big part of what it would take to add them. If you are going to form a larger group, you may as well go and raid current content. There are a lot of questions to answer, such as who is the audience, where do the rewards fit in, should you be doing this raid instead of Hellfire Citadel, and is it something you do to gear up for current raids. <br>
<br>
<br>
Naval Missions<br>
<br>
If you fail a Naval Mission, the mission will still be there for you to try again. <br>
There aren&apos;t any plans to reduce the cost of Naval Equipment right now, but the team is keeping an eye on how players are using the items. <br>
Players want to maximize their chance of success on every mission, but the team envisioned players just countering the basic ship types and some of the threats, but not every single threat. <br>
If players feel that 500 resources are worth it for a small boost in success chance on every mission and actually buy the equipment, adjusting the costs is possible. <br>
<br>
<br>
Feedback<br>
<br>
The team hears the feedback from people that enjoyed solo play in Mists of Pandaria and found it lacking in Draenor. <br>
Part of the problem is many of the rewards out in the world were moved into the garrison. <br>
In Patch 6.2 they took steps towards fixing things by adding content to the world in Tanaan Jungle and more will be done in future content. <br>
The team has been working on Hellfire Citadel and Tanaan Jungle since November 2014, so they were limited in how they could respond to more recent feedback. <br>
The Patch 6.2 content was designed in the same mold as the original Warlords of Draenor content, so it feels like the team wasn&apos;t listening to feedback, even though they are. <br>
Things that are being worked on now will be much more to players liking and the team has taken the feedback to heart. <br>
<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
<br>
Patch 6.2.x with flying should be on the PTR within the next couple of weeks. It should go live not months and months from now, but some number of weeks.<br>
There are no current plans to make all of the Baleful items account wide right now, but it is something that was discussed. If you are playing in Tanaan and already well geared all of the Baleful items aren&apos;t useful for you, which doesn&apos;t feel great.<br>
<br>

Patch 6.2 - Legendary Ring Upgrades<br>
Vanion&apos;s interview (http://www.twitch.tv/vanioneu) confirmed that Archimonde will drop Crystallized Fel (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127785-crystallized-fel) on Normal or greater difficulty, allowing you to upgrade your ring&apos;s stats and proc to item level 795, gaining 3 item levels each time. You can only get one per week, so it will take 20 weeks to hit 795.<br>

Battleground Spec Bug<br>
queued as shadow. loaded in as shadow (or so it said in my talents) with shadowform up, but in my spellbook i only had disc spells. my bars were my shadow bars but with disc specific spells replacing where they&apos;d usually go (so they were all over the place).<br>
<br>
when i tried to use disc spells it said i hadn&apos;t learned them yet. i checked my mastery and that kinda confirmed i was shadow (shows in the screenshot).<br>
Yeah, there&apos;s a bug where sometimes the game pulls outdated information about your character when you load into an Arena or Battleground. We think we&apos;ve isolated what&apos;s causing it and are working on a hotfix.

Corrupted Dread Raven Animation<br>
We&apos;re aware of the issue and working on a fix for it, but it&apos;ll require a patch to implement. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/378698-please-fix-the-corrupted-dread-raven/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18194075317?page=1#7))<br>

Raiding games that aren&apos;t MMOs - why isn&apos;t that a thing? Any thoughts? http://t.co/lwzg217tWa<br>
Very interesting question to consider. Some thoughts, though keep in mind that they&apos;re just my personal opinion... (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/613148122487754753))<br>
Few (no?) games focus purely on large raids (like WoW/Wildstar) largely because it&apos;s difficult to form social groups that size. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/613148184819335169))<br>
In MMOs, solo and small-group gameplay get people into the game so that they can form those kinds of larger social groups. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/613148330793660416))<br>
Any design that aims to form tight groups of 10+ is probably going to need something approachable (solo?) to start players off. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/613148425152958465))<br>
Instead, that kind of boss gameplay tends to find its way into less social games, like Titan Souls (solo) or Diablo (coop). (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/613148531730178048))<br>
That said, it certainly seems possible if a smart designer can come up with new, smooth ways for players to find each other. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/613148706955640832))<br>
