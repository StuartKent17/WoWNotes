Patch 5.2 - No Item Upgrades
Ghostcrawler clarified his previous statement https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287655171583004672 and let us know that no gear will be upgraded at all once Patch 5.2 is released, as the NPC will be removed.

Patch 5.2 - LFR Item Level Requirement
Just wanted to share some updated info we have with you guys: At this moment our intent is to change Thunder King’s LFR ilvl requirement to 480, we also want to lower the Honor gear in patch 5.2 from 483 to 476, compensating with some bonus PvP stats, so that the gear remains as powerful for PvP but not allow players to use it as a quick shortcut into LFR.

Like always, everything is subject to change, we’re still in PTR stage folks! And we all know that even on live things can still change, while we always strike to avoid doing that and that’s why we have a PTR, gameplay comes first, so if a change is urgently needed, we do our best to apply it as fast as possible.


PTR Class and Set Bonus Issues
PvP Power

On live, PvP Power grants 0% healing to Balance, Feral, Windwalker, Retribution, Shadow, Enhancement and Elemental. In the next 5.2 build, this number will be 25% or half of what a healing spec gets. We agree that PvP healing feels too weak for these hybrid classes. We also don't think Shadow really needs this buff, so we will likely offset it in other ways.
We are working on a blog hopefully next week to explain some of the other changes to PvP gear in 5.2. We hear your concerns and are trying to address them.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin / Skills http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin / Talent Calculator http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I

The Protection 2pc is additive. It's duration is 5sec per Holy Power. We realize there are concerns about this enabling block capping, and are keeping an eye on this, and will adjust if necessary to make sure it doesn’t happen, even later in the expansion.
The Protection 4pc does incentivize Unbreakable Spirit http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114154. We’re considering possible revisions but want to try it like this for now. It's currently "You gain 1 Holy Power for each 20% of your health taken as damage while Divine Protection http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/498 is active."
The Retribution 2pc is a debuff on the target, and does not stack or roll. With Glyph of Mass Exorcism http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/879, the debuff will be applied to all targets hit by the Exorcism http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/879. It affects all of your Holy damage. Yes, that includes Seal of Truth http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/31801, Censure http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/31803 ticks, and Hand of Light. Censure http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/31803 ticks are affected per tick whether it was up when Censure http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/31803 was applied doesn't matter. It functions similar to the increased magic damage taken raid debuff, except is Holy-only and self-only. Clipping some debuffs when you get back to back Art of War procs is expected, and balanced around.
The Retribution 4pc does grant a self-buff that is consumed by the next TV, and does not stack. Wasting some procs is expected, and balanced around. Yes it is a single-target benefit that won't increase DPS on AE fights. We don't want to be in such a limited design space we're talking about the 15th tier here after all that every set bonus must be super generic and work in every situation. If anything, we'd rather the Ret bonus be even higher for single-target and paladins will just be stronger at single-target and weaker at AE once they have the set bonus than they are in other tiers. Set bonuses are one of the few chances we have to change what your character does within reason aside from all of your numbers just getting bigger.
We changed the Repentance http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20066 cast time to make it consistent with other cast time crowd control. A 1.5 sec cast time reduced by haste gives little opportunity for interruption.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue / Skills http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/rogue / Talent Calculator http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Q

During Shuriken Toss http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114014, your auto attacks are replaced with throwing Shurikens, which do 80% weapon damage, but are on the 'yellow combat table', meaning they don't glance, and don't suffer the Dual Wield http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/124146 miss penalty. The 80% number was chosen because that approximately offsets those other benefits.
In our above description of Blade Flurry http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/13877, 'normal' means the same as it previously did; that is to say, the damage that the ability would have done had it hit the secondary target.
The 2pc does encourage using Rupture http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/1943 as Combat. 
Burst of Speed http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108212 saying "movement-reducing" means that it no longer breaks roots, but does break snares.
We are experimenting with allowing Smoke Bomb http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/76577 to reduce the damage done to allies by 20%. We agree that rogues are lacking in the group utility department and we'd like to see less use of Smoke Bomb http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/76577 strictly as an offensive ability in PvP.
We are going to reduce the PvP set bonus from +50 energy to +30 energy.

Storm, Earth, and Fire does not affect Xuen's damage. The spirits benefit from your Tiger Eye Brew. We agree that a spell with "storm, earth and fire" in the name sounds like a shaman spell, but Warcraft 3 established it as a Pandaren monk ability.
The Mistweaver 2pc is multiplicative. The first target gets normal healing, the second gets 115% of normal, and the third gets 132.25% of normal.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter / Skills http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter / Talent Calculator http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M

The 2pc and 4pc both can crit.
Direhorn Stampede http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/121818 are everything you dream them to be.

Please note that Restoration Mushrooms are currently incorrectly absorbing 33% of overheal each, instead of 25%.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman / Skills http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/shaman / Talent Calculator http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#c

The Elemental 4pc does trigger from Overloads.
We're still iterating on the cooldown/potency/duration of Elemental Mastery http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/16166. In the next PTR build, it will likely be a 90 sec cooldown. 
We are experimenting with removing the attenuation of Chain Lightning http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/421. This means Chain Lightning http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/421 won't do less damage on subsequent targets.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest / Skills http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest / Talent Calculator http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#U

The Shadow 2pc does impact Shadow Word: Insanity http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/129249, which we're working to resolve. It extends existing effects, preserving their same damage not recalculating.
We are considering making the glyphs of Desperation and Inner Focus http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/89485 passive for Discipline.
We are considering giving Focused Will to Holy as well as Discipline.
We did not buff PvP Power for healer damage as we did for DPS healing. However, we believe that Discipline specifically might need more damage. One potential solution is to nerf Atonement http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/81749 healing but raise damage so there is no net healing change.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock / Skills http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warlock / Talent Calculator http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#k

With the 2pc, an Incinerate http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/29722 crit has an 8% chance to generate 4/10 of an ember. Yes, this will apply to Fire and Brimstone http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108683 Incinerate http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/29722.
We are strongly considering allowing Dark Intent http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/109773 to provide Stamina so that warlocks don't feel like they must use their imp.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior / Skills http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warrior / Talent Calculator http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#E

A Prot Warrior using 2 pieces of the DPS set will get 1.0 RPPM of the Enrage http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5229.
We agree with concerns that the new Arms rotation doesn't involve much rage management. We are considering a small rage cost for Overpower http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/7384. Arms will likely need some additional retuning of damage because of the changes to Overpower http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/7384, Taste for Blood http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56638 and Slam http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/1464 we haven't completed tuning yet.
We made a change to warriors to double the effect of haste for them. This is similar to the shaman Flurry http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/16282 benefit, but is passive and not tied to an ability. We want to make haste a better stat for warriors without it eclipsing stats like crit we aren't trying to force every warrior to reforge.


Promises
We're not making any except maybe that Direhorn Stampede bit. We're providing you some notes of changes we are currently trying in order to provide you context for some of the other class changes. Many of these may not make it to the live game -- that is the nature of a PTR. As always, we appreciate feedback on any of this.

Storm, Earth, and Fire: The spirits will not mirror non-damaging abilities like Leg Sweep http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/119381 or Charging Ox Wave http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/119392. They will mirror damaging abilities like Chi Wave http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115098. In the cases of damaging abilities that also heal Chi Wave http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115098, Zen Sphere http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/124081, and Chi Burst http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/130651, their healing and yours is reduced. But for other heals which aren’t mirrored like Healing Sphere http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115460, Blackout Kick http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100784 from the front, or consuming a Healthstone, it won’t reduce the healing. In the case of Zen Sphere http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/124081, the spirits will cast it on themselves when you cast it on anyone. Note that many of these things aren’t working yet, but should in the next PTR build, or perhaps the one after that. Also, in the next PTR build, attempting to cast it on a target that already has one of your spirits on it will recall that spirit.

The Enhancement 4pc triggers each time Windfury procs, not for each attack it generates.

If you have the Protection 2pc, casting Word of Glory http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/85673 again when you already have the block buff will replace the existing buff, if the new one is longer duration. It won’t extend.
The Protection 4pc will not count for Holy Avenger http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/105809.

The Healing 2pc causes each Prayer of Mending http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/33110 Heal http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/2050 to heal for 10% more than the last; it’s multiplicative. 100%->110%->121%->133%->146%.

The Restoration 4pc causes each Rejuvenation http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/774 tick to heal for 6% more than the last; it’s multiplicative. 100%->106%->112%->119%->126%->134%->etc.

We will reword the 2pc to be more clear about how it works. “Your Shield Slam http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/23922 and Revenge http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/6572 have a 10% chance to activate Victory Rush http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/34428 or Impending Victory http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/103840 as if you had killed your target.”

Some have asked why the 2pc procs more often for Survival than Marksmanship. Marksmanship typically has more haste than Survival, such as from Steady Focus http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53224. Remember, RealPPM proc rates scale with your haste.

Throne of Thunder and Mounts
Finally, I think we need to be able to mount in that instance. I think travel time is just going to be way too much of a problem otherwise.
The fact that you cannot currently mount in the exterior ruins section of the zone is a bug. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/250646-feedback-council-of-elders-10n/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7592801294?page=2#32

Being a casual has nothing to do with what GC is saying.
In fact casual players are probably more likely to opt out of hard content for which rewards will be quickly replaced. 
Also i believe the "accomplishment envy" faction is small. And why should a game be catered to envy?

yes it does. I wish GC would just announce once and for all the game is tailored for the hardcores.
