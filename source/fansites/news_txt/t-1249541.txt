Patch 5.2 - No Item Upgrades
Ghostcrawler clarified his previous statement  and let us know that no gear will be upgraded at all once Patch 5.2 is released, as the NPC will be removed. 


  


Patch 5.2 - LFR Item Level Requirement
Just wanted to share some updated info we have with you guys: At this moment our intent is to change Thunder King’s LFR ilvl requirement to 480, we also want to lower the Honor gear in patch 5.2 from 483 to 476, compensating with some bonus PvP stats, so that the gear remains as powerful for PvP but not allow players to use it as a quick shortcut into LFR.

Like always, everything is subject to change, we’re still in PTR stage folks! And we all know that even on live things can still change, while we always strike to avoid doing that and that’s why we have a PTR, gameplay comes first, so if a change is urgently needed, we do our best to apply it as fast as possible.


PTR Class and Set Bonus Issues
PvP Power

On live, PvP Power grants 0% healing to Balance, Feral, Windwalker, Retribution, Shadow, Enhancement and Elemental. In the next 5.2 build, this number will be 25% or half of what a healing spec gets. We agree that PvP healing feels too weak for these hybrid classes. We also don't think Shadow really needs this buff, so we will likely offset it in other ways.
We are working on a blog hopefully next week to explain some of the other changes to PvP gear in 5.2. We hear your concerns and are trying to address them.


 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

The Protection 2pc is additive. It's duration is 5sec per Holy Power. We realize there are concerns about this enabling block capping, and are keeping an eye on this, and will adjust if necessary to make sure it doesn’t happen, even later in the expansion.
The Protection 4pc does incentivize Unbreakable Spirit  We’re considering possible revisions but want to try it like this for now. It's currently "You gain 1 Holy Power for each 20% of your health taken as damage while Divine Protection  is active."
The Retribution 2pc is a debuff on the target, and does not stack or roll. With Glyph of Mass Exorcism , the debuff will be applied to all targets hit by the Exorcism  It affects all of your Holy damage. Yes, that includes Seal of Truth , Censure  ticks, and Hand of Light. Censure  ticks are affected per tick whether it was up when Censure  was applied doesn't matter. It functions similar to the increased magic damage taken raid debuff, except is Holy-only and self-only. Clipping some debuffs when you get back to back Art of War procs is expected, and balanced around.
The Retribution 4pc does grant a self-buff that is consumed by the next TV, and does not stack. Wasting some procs is expected, and balanced around. Yes it is a single-target benefit that won't increase DPS on AE fights. We don't want to be in such a limited design space we're talking about the 15th tier here after all that every set bonus must be super generic and work in every situation. If anything, we'd rather the Ret bonus be even higher for single-target and paladins will just be stronger at single-target and weaker at AE once they have the set bonus than they are in other tiers. Set bonuses are one of the few chances we have to change what your character does within reason aside from all of your numbers just getting bigger.
We changed the Repentance  cast time to make it consistent with other cast time crowd control. A 1.5 sec cast time reduced by haste gives little opportunity for interruption.


 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

During Shuriken Toss , your auto attacks are replaced with throwing Shurikens, which do 80% weapon damage, but are on the 'yellow combat table', meaning they don't glance, and don't suffer the Dual Wield  miss penalty. The 80% number was chosen because that approximately offsets those other benefits.
In our above description of Blade Flurry , 'normal' means the same as it previously did; that is to say, the damage that the ability would have done had it hit the secondary target.
The 2pc does encourage using Rupture  as Combat. 
Burst of Speed  saying "movement-reducing" means that it no longer breaks roots, but does break snares.
We are experimenting with allowing Smoke Bomb  to reduce the damage done to allies by 20%. We agree that rogues are lacking in the group utility department and we'd like to see less use of Smoke Bomb  strictly as an offensive ability in PvP.
We are going to reduce the PvP set bonus from +50 energy to +30 energy.


 Monk Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Storm, Earth, and Fire does not affect Xuen's damage. The spirits benefit from your Tiger Eye Brew. We agree that a spell with "storm, earth and fire" in the name sounds like a shaman spell, but Warcraft 3 established it as a Pandaren monk ability.
The Mistweaver 2pc is multiplicative. The first target gets normal healing, the second gets 115% of normal, and the third gets 132.25% of normal.


 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

The 2pc and 4pc both can crit.
Direhorn Stampede  are everything you dream them to be.


 Druid Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Please note that Restoration Mushrooms are currently incorrectly absorbing 33% of overheal each, instead of 25%.


 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

The Elemental 4pc does trigger from Overloads.
We're still iterating on the cooldown/potency/duration of Elemental Mastery  In the next PTR build, it will likely be a 90 sec cooldown. 
We are experimenting with removing the attenuation of Chain Lightning  This means Chain Lightning  won't do less damage on subsequent targets.


 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

The Shadow 2pc does impact Shadow Word: Insanity , which we're working to resolve. It extends existing effects, preserving their same damage not recalculating.
We are considering making the glyphs of Desperation and Inner Focus  passive for Discipline.
We are considering giving Focused Will to Holy as well as Discipline.
We did not buff PvP Power for healer damage as we did for DPS healing. However, we believe that Discipline specifically might need more damage. One potential solution is to nerf Atonement  healing but raise damage so there is no net healing change.


 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

With the 2pc, an Incinerate  crit has an 8% chance to generate 4/10 of an ember. Yes, this will apply to Fire and Brimstone  Incinerate 
We are strongly considering allowing Dark Intent  to provide Stamina so that warlocks don't feel like they must use their imp.


 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

A Prot Warrior using 2 pieces of the DPS set will get 1.0 RPPM of the Enrage 
We agree with concerns that the new Arms rotation doesn't involve much rage management. We are considering a small rage cost for Overpower  Arms will likely need some additional retuning of damage because of the changes to Overpower , Taste for Blood  and Slam  we haven't completed tuning yet.
We made a change to warriors to double the effect of haste for them. This is similar to the shaman Flurry  benefit, but is passive and not tied to an ability. We want to make haste a better stat for warriors without it eclipsing stats like crit we aren't trying to force every warrior to reforge.


Promises
We're not making any except maybe that Direhorn Stampede bit. We're providing you some notes of changes we are currently trying in order to provide you context for some of the other class changes. Many of these may not make it to the live game -- that is the nature of a PTR. As always, we appreciate feedback on any of this.

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Storm, Earth, and Fire: The spirits will not mirror non-damaging abilities like Leg Sweep  or Charging Ox Wave  They will mirror damaging abilities like Chi Wave  In the cases of damaging abilities that also heal Chi Wave , Zen Sphere , and Chi Burst , their healing and yours is reduced. But for other heals which aren’t mirrored like Healing Sphere , Blackout Kick  from the front, or consuming a Healthstone, it won’t reduce the healing. In the case of Zen Sphere , the spirits will cast it on themselves when you cast it on anyone. Note that many of these things aren’t working yet, but should in the next PTR build, or perhaps the one after that. Also, in the next PTR build, attempting to cast it on a target that already has one of your spirits on it will recall that spirit.


 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

The Enhancement 4pc triggers each time Windfury procs, not for each attack it generates.


 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

If you have the Protection 2pc, casting Word of Glory  again when you already have the block buff will replace the existing buff, if the new one is longer duration. It won’t extend.
The Protection 4pc will not count for Holy Avenger 


 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

The Healing 2pc causes each Prayer of Mending  Heal  to heal for 10% more than the last; it’s multiplicative. 100%->110%->121%->133%->146%.


 Druid Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

The Restoration 4pc causes each Rejuvenation  tick to heal for 6% more than the last; it’s multiplicative. 100%->106%->112%->119%->126%->134%->etc.


 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

We will reword the 2pc to be more clear about how it works. “Your Shield Slam  and Revenge  have a 10% chance to activate Victory Rush  or Impending Victory  as if you had killed your target.”


 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Some have asked why the 2pc procs more often for Survival than Marksmanship. Marksmanship typically has more haste than Survival, such as from Steady Focus  Remember, RealPPM proc rates scale with your haste.

Throne of Thunder and Mounts
Finally, I think we need to be able to mount in that instance. I think travel time is just going to be way too much of a problem otherwise.
The fact that you cannot currently mount in the exterior ruins section of the zone is a bug. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

PvP Gear Changes Blog Post
Other than the blog that you have linked from October, is there anything else you can "hint" to us that is more recent that we can possibly expect in the near future?
Not just yet. Soon™. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Incentive to explore has always been a weak point in WoW,Can we expect more achievements like "Lost and Found" to remedy this?
We just have to make exploring really exploring and not download a mod / visit a website. Source 

just wanted to clarify something r u now or have you ever been completely or partially against flying mounts?
It's not that simple. It would be hard to remove them, yet we don't like how they minimize exploration, travel & sense of danger. Source 
Isnt minimizing travel the whole point of a mount? Also, they dont minimize exploration, in my case they improve it
The journey is a big biggest? part of most fantasy tales. For me, exploration needs a hint of danger to be interesting. Source 
that doesn't really answer my question
It's not a question with a simple answer. Sorry. If I could go back in time, I would argue for much stricter limits on them. Source 
I remember reading a PvP blog that flying mounts made escaping too easy, do you think "hardened shell" is enough?
It was just an experiment to see how it felt. Source 

Do you feel like CRZ takes away the one advantage small pop servers had of less competition for rare spawns?
We don't really want small pop servers to have advantages though. We think larger pop servers are more fun. Source 

I know u r concerned about the role of guilds in xrealm raiding, but isn't the point of being n a guild 2 b with ppl u like?
There are still benefit in realm community. Queuing features are a necessary evil, not because we don't value community. Source 

Misc
I have friends who've already tried the expac. They got to 90 and they've already given up, "I have to log in EVERY day....!?"
The opposite extreme is "Why am I playing this game? I log in once a week and then there is nothing else to do." Source 

Remember, while convenience is nice, accomplishments are rewarding. Accomplishments with too much convenience may not feel rewarding. Source 
Parapharsing someone I can't recall: "We don't play this game because it is easy, we play it because it is hard."
In China, I hear a lot: I don't play the game because it's fun. I play for prestige. Source 

Being a casual has nothing to do with what GC is saying.
In fact casual players are probably more likely to opt out of hard content for which rewards will be quickly replaced. 
Also i believe the "accomplishment envy" faction is small. And why should a game be catered to envy?
.It's not about that. It's "Why should I bother on this tough boss when the new content will just invalidate all the gear anyway?" Source 

yes it does. I wish GC would just announce once and for all the game is tailored for the hardcores.
It's not. Not sure there are 10 million hardcore players in the world. Source 

More and more people are heading to private vanilla servers, why not just make an official one?
We don't want to maintain two versions of the game and we don't believe that the vanilla crowd would be happy with no support. Source 

Nobody cares about dummy dps because there is no movement involved and such bosses dont exist in mop.
If only that were true. Players use simulated dummy dps as evidence all the time. Source
