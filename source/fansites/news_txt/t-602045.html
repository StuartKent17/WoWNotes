European servers down<br>
A few european servers are down, Blizzard is aware of the problem and working on it.<br>
We&#x2019;re currently experiencing connection issues with the below realms, and are investigating this with our partners. There&#x2019;s no ETA at this time. We apologise for the inconvenience and will get back to you with an update as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
Affected realms: Aerie Peak, Boulderfist, Eonar, Frostmane, Grim Batol, Jaedenar, Kazzak, Kilrogg, Outland, Ravenholdt, Stonemaul, Tarren Mill, Vek&apos;nilash, Wildhammer<br>
<br>
Our technical team is working diligently to resolve this matter, and we hope to have these realms accessible again as soon as possible.<br>

South Park : Make Love, Not Warcraft<br>
The South Park WoW episode: &quot;Make Love, Not Warcraft&quot; won a Creative Arts Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)&quot; and I will use this as an excuse to post something else that I forgot to report last week.<br>
<br>
If you didn&apos;t see the episode, you can now buy the South Park: The Complete Tenth Season (http://shop.comedycentral.com/South-Park--The-Complete-Tenth-Season--3-Discs--Front-Page_stcVVproductId19108230VVcatId424910VVviewprod.htm) in Comedy Central online shop, but also, if you use the &quot;WARCRAFT&quot; code you will get a 15% discount and free shipping. Bad news is, it won&apos;t work outside of the US as far as I know.<br>
