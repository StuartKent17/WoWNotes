Dungeons Update - Chamber of Aspects and Eye of Eternity<br>
Today we&apos;re also adding the Chamber of Aspects (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=813) and The Eye of Eternity (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?tab=1&amp;page=814) to our dungeon pages. As far as we know both zones are single-encounter raid dungeons, the first one will let you fight a black dragon named &quot;Sartharion, the Onyx Guardian&quot;. The Eye of Eternity is the last dungeon of the Nexus and will let you face Malygos himself ! <br>

Badge of Justices / Arena &amp; Honor Points in WotLK<br>
The current Badges of Justice should still be obtainable via level 70 heroic dungeons after Wrath of the Lich King launches but only used for level 70 gear. We currently plan to continue with a badge type of system, but new ones will drop in Wrath of the Lich King.

We talked about this a bit in the last episode of BlizzCast, like how we plan to expand on the system and possibly have different tiers of badges and such, so this can&apos;t come as a big surprise that you can&apos;t stack up 800 Badges of Justice and buy level 80 gear right away.

We are still working out the details on how we want to handle honor/arena points, we&apos;ll have more details soon enough though. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8557297999&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#46))<br>

Defense is usually a pretty easy stat to max out with gear, whereas you can&apos;t really do that on dodge. We saw some tanks actually spec out of Anticipation at the T6 or so level because it just stops being as useful as your gear improves. Hit is another stat we don&apos;t really like to hit in talent trees, since it&apos;s possible to hit the cap with gear alone.

The problem with the old Shield Block was it was never a choice. It was available so often, and always so useful, that you could just about put a brick on the key you use for Shield Block. We&apos;re trying to get Shield Block to feel more like a mini-Shield Wall. Use it when Something Bad is about to happen. We&apos;re not trying to nerf it -- we&apos;re trying to make it more fun.

We have to be careful with this talent (Stalwart Protector) because prot warriors are going to generate a lot more rage than before, just because their dps is going to be higher. A lot of tanking gear comes with strength now. Strength is a good stat, and even before the shield block change, it was probably the best +threat stat you have. I sort of feel that for too long we have all emphasized mitigation as the primary role of a tank, when in reality it&apos;s only half the job. Doing more dps will let tanks be more fun when not-tanking, and for warriors, might make a lot of rage starvation issues go away.

Devastate includes Sunder Armor as part of its effect. Any benefit to Sunder will apply. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8557366167&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=2000#15))<br>

Changing Mana Shield - We&apos;re talking about it... (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8557147364&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=2000#2))<br>
Living Bomb - We&apos;ve considered giving it a knock back or *ahem* &quot;knock up&quot; but we felt that probably wouldn&apos;t be desired for what Living Bomb is made for. It works for Thunderstorm (Elemental Shaman Talent) because Shaman&apos;s aren&apos;t an AOE class, and because it&apos;s cooldown controlled. I don&apos;t think we&apos;re done yet with Living Bomb, just not completely sure with what we want with it yet.

We nuked Shatter Shield and put it into a talent instead (as you&apos;ve noticed). The new Mage ability has yet to be unveiled... (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8557298552&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=2000#3))<br>

Like I promised, the paladin changes were more sweeping than most changes. As such, it&apos;s going to take us some time to go through a second pass on the abilities and get everything polished up enough to evaluate the shiny, new paladin. I expect we&apos;ll be a lot more active on this forum when that happens. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8557026869&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=2000#8))<br>
Beacon of Light - We&apos;re working on tweaking this spell a bit to make it fit the Paladin&apos;s &quot;kit&quot; a bit more... look for the change in an upcoming build. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8202465858&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=2000#12))<br>

Aggro Generation of Aegis / Shields - I am concerned about this, and will make sure it&apos;s not too much of a problem. If it is, we can always do a glyph or talent that causes the target to regen rage/runic power etc. when they absorb damage through your spells. That will be a last resort, however.

If you&apos;ve noticed a lot of the ranks have similar mana costs, though I do agree Mind Sear&apos;s mana cost seems particularly high... I&apos;ve been assured that the mana costs for the new ranks of spells and for the new spells are accurate in relation to the mana pools players will have with the new itemization. We&apos;ll make sure the mana cost isn&apos;t offensive when we do some internal raid testing in the coming weeks. We also made the ability not work on the primary target because we didn&apos;t want Mind Sear to be used as a ghetto Mind Flay and because we found it was annoying when the target you were casting Mind Sear on died, causing you to re-cast it.

The devilsaur is an exotic pet that will ultimately require 51-BM to tame. There are several other exotic pets that are not implemented yet. (The moth is not an exotic pet.) The size of the devilsaur is not a bug, but I also can&apos;t promise it&apos;s going to stay that way. It would be awesome if it did, but only if it doesn&apos;t cause a bunch of other problems, like clipping through terrain and making it impossible to see mailboxes in Dalaran.
