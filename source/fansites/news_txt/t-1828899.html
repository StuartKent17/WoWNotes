Get Ready for Gamescom 2015!<br>
It looks like the next expansion may not be demoed at Gamescom, as the listing below only talks about playing Warlords.<br>
Blizzard&#x2019;s gearing up for another epic gamescom this year! From August 5-9, we&#x2019;ll be providing plenty of entertainment at our biggest booth to date in Hall 7 of the Koelnmesse in Cologne, Germany.<br>
<br>
The highlight of the show will happen on the Blizzard stage on Thursday, August 6 at 9:00 a.m. PDT, when we unveil the next expansion for World of Warcraft! Catch it in person or via live stream at www.blizzgc.com.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll have four packed days of activities around all of our games. You can experience everything from competitive gameplay to developer signing sessions, from our famous costume and dance contests to live music&#x2014;including a special performance from Video Games Live! There are prizes to be won in live quizzes each day, as well as our costume and dance contests. Want to show off your moves? Sign up at the booth! Be sure to check out the below tabs for all the game-specific activities, and visit the website (http://www.blizzgc.com/) for a full stage schedule.<br>
<br>

You can battle it out in Heroes of the Storm, and try out Overwatch for the first time in Europe. Experience StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void and its new co-operative mode, Allied Commanders, and fight the formidable Iron Horde in World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor.<br>
<br>
You&#x2019;ll also have loads of photos opportunities at our booth, including statues and weapon props used in the upcoming Warcraft movie! Share your Blizzard at gamescom experience on social media using the #BlizzGC2015 hashtag, and your post may appear on our dedicated site.<br>

New Expansion and Communication<br>
Seriously, even though there are people frustrated with aspects of Warlords, or simply just a little worn out from spending so many years playing this game, I hope your curiosity about what we&apos;ve got cooking is still there. It should be a fun event next week. I trust that many people in this community can check any baggage they might have at the door and earnestly step into the announcement with us.<br>
<br>
It&apos;s not just about building hype either. We want to share what lies ahead and get some new conversations going. <br>
<br>
I can say no more!<br>
<br>
Is that not hype? lol<br>
I mean, that&apos;s the thing. Hype is innately a part of announcing a thing. I&apos;ve just seen a lot of people talk about our &quot;hype machine&quot; in a highly cynical fashion lately. I know it&apos;s because we&apos;ve announced some things and then changed our plans or cut them further along in development.<br>
<br>
I&apos;ll just say that we&apos;re sensitive to that. Our intent is never to share big ideas or plans purely for the purposes of generating additional hype. All that&apos;s going to do is breed frustration and mistrust down the road. None of us chose careers in snake oil sales.<br>
<br>
And then, when people don&apos;t like what lies ahead and start talking about it, locking those new coversations!<br>
I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s an honest comment or more of a jab. But either way, I&apos;ve been moderating and posting in blue on Blizzard forums for 9 years now, and never has there been a time where we&apos;ve tried to completely stamp out honest conversations of opinions about the game or speculation of what&apos;s to come -- at least not simply on the merit that the opinions being expressed on a given topic are largely negative. <br>
<br>
Anyone who reads this and wonders why specific threads they were involved in were deleted in the past, the answer is almost definitely in our forum posting guidelines and Code of Conduct. Nowhere in those guidelines, however, does it say that you aren&apos;t allowed to share a negative opinion of the game. For real!<br>
<br>
Zar says easily misconstrued things far to often and when someone calls him out on his often dismissive and arrogant tone he just stops responding or says he was misunderstood. The fact that (as he&apos;ll often tell you) he&apos;s been a blue for 9 years means he should know to chose what words he uses veeerryy carefully. For that reason, I&apos;m inclined to take everything he says at face value.<br>
I choose my words carefully. But I&apos;m also not going to be a perfectly polished PR robot when I&apos;m sharing in conversation on the forums. I don&apos;t think a lot of people would appreciate it if I was either.<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t have a problem with you taking what I say at face value. That&apos;s fair. I don&apos;t know that your summation of my communication style is very fair though. I&apos;m vastly outnumbered on this forum and my words are in bright blue to attract everyone. And there are scores of people who will take every possible angle to pick at what I&apos;m saying. And I know that that&apos;s going to happen before I hit the &quot;Submit&quot; button, but I&apos;m not going to let that completely tongue tie me when I want to talk to people.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m not asking for sympathy. It&apos;s part of the job, I know. The job also requires a lot of empathy and a lot of rallying on behalf of players when discussing feedback internally. Hopefully, even if my manner of posting rubs you the wrong way, you can at least understand that we&apos;re not meant to be at odds with one another. We want a fun video game that brings people together with joy, regardless of how complicated that can be for a game and community of this magnitude.<br>
<br>
My main issue with the blue posting is that they often never respond to well thought out threads regarding actual game suggestions, and threads that are actually addressing valid concerns with the game.<br>
We may not respond to many, but we certainly read them, note them down, and relay the feedback directly to developers. We&apos;ve said it before; there are times where we just can&apos;t comment, or we&apos;re privy to information about upcoming changes that we&apos;ve been asked not to address (we don&apos;t want to spoil all the surprises). It&apos;s part of the process and part of our job. But that doesn&apos;t mean we don&apos;t care or aren&apos;t reading your feedback. Sure, we could jump into a suggestion or feedback thread and merely post, &quot;Thank you!&quot;, but that&apos;s often seen as antagonistic to some, and not nearly enough for others.<br>
<br>
By all means, please keep posting suggestions and feedback. We do appreciate it, and we&apos;ll continue to relay it to the developers.<br>
<br>
It makes it very hard for me to get hyped for next expansion when devs in interviews don&apos;t focally acknowledge how bad certain things are right now. &quot;We learned some lessons&quot; does not give me hope for a better future, because we&apos;ve heard that line a thousand times over.<br>
I do understand your point and don&apos;t want to distract from it, but also that statement is 100% true every time we use it. We always learn a lot from the design decisions we make, and how they play out in both a test and live environment, that we can carry forward. And that&apos;s a good thing.<br>
<br>
There&apos;s a vast amount of game design knowledge and expertise on the team, but like virtually any other job you still learn as you go and do your best to positively apply that extra knowledge in your latest work.<br>
<br>
You may not be able to get say much, but a small little pop in saying you at least saw and are relaying the topics would be HUGE. When people see no responces even though we may believe you guys are listening it starts to look otherwise. The players are just as passionate of the game as you guys are and simple small acknowledgements would go a long way to have people at least know you saw the post. Especialy with the big hot topics. I really feel sorry for the pvp&apos;ers. those poor buggers don&apos;t get any info at all.and every suggestion seems to be countered with another terrible idea.<br>
I won&apos;t say that&apos;s a bad idea and I don&apos;t mean to come off as stubborn here. In principle I agree with you and we&apos;ve done those types of acknowledging responses in the past. Sometimes, though, the acknowledgement creates a separate issue unto itself from the &quot;we&apos;re being ignored&quot; perception, in that people sometimes take the acknowledgement as an indication of action on our part. At first it&apos;s a pretty innocent, positive thing to show acknowledgement. But, depending on what the feedback is about, some people will ask why we haven&apos;t done anything about it 24 hours later, a week later, a month later, what have you.<br>
<br>
It creates an almost cyclical pattern where people still feel ignored if we let the acknowledgement sit alone and linger without more input from us, except it can create even more tension &apos;cause we&apos;re viewed as blatantly disregarding something we previously acknowledged. Now suddenly we&apos;re viewed as willfully or stubbornly ignoring a topic we&apos;ve clearly seen. The act of acknowledging is just another empty gesture at that point.<br>
<br>
Again, I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s never a good idea. It usually depends on the circumstances. But those are just things we have to think about and weigh before tagging something in blue. As I said earlier in the thread, the blue tends to bring a lot more attention to a topic. If we throw acknowledgements around without more meaningful input to provide as a follow-up, or without some type of clear design reaction, after a while it&apos;s going to come across as insincere, and synonymous with ignoring the issue anyway.<br>
<br>
The field of Communications can be pretty complicated, even when you want to keep things as simple, transparent, and honest as possible. No matter what type of community is formed around something, especially online, people will dissect everything that&apos;s said, pick statements apart, reinterpret words, band together over common beliefs/opinions, drift toward whatever popular theories are going around, etc. And I don&apos;t mean any of this in a cynical or condescending way. It&apos;s just sort of how we&apos;re wired, and the internet adds a whole other element to social behavior in a community. If that makes sense...<br>
Which leads me to this question: do you guys ever post on normal accounts? Participate in a discussion posing as another player, so as to mitigate the influence and impact the blue text has?<br>
No. It feels too shady. I chat with folks on my characters in the game like anyone else, but it just feels different on the forums. When we&apos;re not posting as actively on the forums we&apos;re often looking at things on a more macro scale -- including using some Community Management System tools behind the scenes for data analysis -- figuring out what are the common points of feedback and such, so for me it&apos;d feel too much like meddling to jump in &quot;anonymously.&quot; (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/382076-dear-zarhym/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18300116718?page=10#192))<br>

Ion Hazzikostas. Just watching your Q&amp;A where you said Imperitor means emperor in Latin. awks.. its a military rank.<br>
True, my Latin teacher would be disappointed. At least some emperors did use the title and it&apos;s the root of the English word. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/624333592991141888))<br>
