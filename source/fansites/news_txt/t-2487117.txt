Essences Feedback - Multiple Role Essences
These issues with Memory of Lucid Dreams’ minor effect should be resolved in the next PTR build for Protection Paladin. Thanks for the bug report! Blue Tracker https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105773-essences-feedback-multiple-role-essences/ / Official Forums https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/181167/27

The next PTR build will have a change for both Brewmaster Monks and Guardian Druids with the Major power on Vision of Perfection.
Brewmaster Monks have had the Major effect changed to activate Invoke Niuzao, the Black Ox, when it procs. It will summon it for 25/35% rank1/rank2 of the talent’s duration.

Guardian Druids have had the Major effect changed to activate Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc for 25/35% of the talent’s duration when it procs.
The Minor/passive effect is unchanged for both specs, it will still provide cooldown reduction to Fortifying Brew or Survival Instincts.
This should help the Essence feel a bit more noticeable and meaningful when it activates. Try it out in the next PTR build. Blue Tracker https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105773-essences-feedback-multiple-role-essences/ / Official Forums https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/181167/28


WoW Classic “Not A Bug” List Additions
I’ve added this to the OP:

You are unable to Polymorph enemy targets that are tapped by players with whom you are not grouped. Blue Tracker https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105647-wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/ / Official Forums https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/175887/13
At all levels of player characters and enemies, aggro radius is set to the intended distance. Blue Tracker https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105647-wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/ / Official Forums https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/175887/14
Long quest objectives don’t have text wrapping.
Fall damage is equivalent to expected and verified values.
Broadcast text can be seen multiple times if multiple players interact with the same NPC.
WANTED signs do not have “!”, and are also not highlighted.
Player characters do not animate when looting/interacting with quest objects e.g. collecting pumpkins.
Gnomes and Taurens are the correct size. 


The last one has been carefully verified. Blue Tracker https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105647-wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/ / Official Forums https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/175887/18
