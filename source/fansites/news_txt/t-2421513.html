Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2018/08/15/diablo-iii-is-coming-to-the-nintendo-switch-in-2018-with-exclusive-content/) appears to have accidentally published an article about Diablo III coming to the Switch too early. Kotaku (https://kotaku.com/diablo-iii-is-coming-to-switch-later-this-year-1828367234) has confirmed this information. <br>
