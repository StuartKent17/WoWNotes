Ko'ragh was the only ogre to survive direct exposure to a mysterious relic unearthed by the Highmaul excavations of Nagrand, and was left with a near-complete immunity to all magic. Rumors abound regarding his connection to the Imperator, with some wondering why Ko'ragh would remain subservient to a sorcerer despite his unique gifts.


Overview - Ko'ragh is protected by a Nullification Barrier that absorbs all magic damage taken. When the barrier is removed, he activates a rune that recharges it. While recharging, one player may also absorb some of the rune's energy and receive a Nullification Barrier. As the fight progresses, an increasing amount of Overflowing Energy orbs spill from the rune and float to the ground, exploding when they land. Players who have a Nullification Barrier can catch and absorb Overflowing Energy to mitigate the amount of raid wide damage and prevent a lethal amount of damage from occurring. In Mythic difficulty, two players may enter the rune per phase of Charging.

<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/tank.png" title="Tank" /> Tanks - Tanks marked with <a href="http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/162186-expel-magic-arcane">Expel Magic: Arcane</a> must run away from their allies and avoid the periodic explosions.
Volatile Anomalies will spawn periodically during the charging phase. If they are killed within a <a href="http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/161328-suppression-field">Suppression Field</a>, they will not cast <a href="http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/163466-destabilize">Destabilize</a>.

<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/dps.png" title="Dps" /> Nullification Barrier http://www.wowdb.com/spells/156803 - Ko'ragh is protected from all magic, absorbing up to 4,020,890 Magic damage.

Breaker's Strength http://www.wowdb.com/spells/162569 - While Ko'ragh maintains a Nullification Barrier, his damage done is increased by 8% every 10 seconds. This effect stacks. When the barrier expires, Breaker's Strength is removed.
Charging http://www.wowdb.com/spells/1538 - When the Ko'ragh's Nullification Barrier is removed, he begins to recharge. After 20 sec, the barrier is restored.

<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/important.png" title="Important" /> Caustic Energy http://www.wowdb.com/spells/161242 - One player may enter the rune with Ko'ragh, absorbing a portion of its energy. The energy inflicts 32,152 Arcane damage every second and reduces all healing received by 5% for as long as the player remains inside of the rune. This effect pierces all immunities and damage reductions. When the rune powers down, the player receives their own Nullification Barrier, proportional to the amount of time spent inside the rune. The Nullification Barrier received by players can absorb up to 15,000,000 Magic damage. In Mythic difficulty, two players may enter the rune per phase of Charging. In Raid Finder difficulty, five players may enter the rune per phase of Charging.


Suppression Field http://www.wowdb.com/spells/161328 - Ko'ragh strikes the ground at a player's location, inflicting 57,200 Arcane damage in an 8 yard area. In addition, a field of suppressing energy is created that silences all players and inflicts 34,280 Arcane damage every second.<br/><br/>This effect will also silence Volatile Anomalies.
Volatile Anomalies - While the Rune of Nullification is active, 3 Volatile Anomalies spawn every 8 sec.

Destabilize http://www.wowdb.com/spells/163466 - Volatile Anomalies explode upon death, inflicting 28,575 Arcane damage to all players.

Expel Magic - 

<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/magic.png" title="Magic" /> Expel Magic: Fire http://www.wowdb.com/spells/162185 - Ko'ragh expels Fire magic inflicting 10,725 Fire damage every second for 10 sec. to all players. When Expel Magic: Fire expires, it inflicts 57,200 Fire damage to all allies within 5 yards.
Expel Magic: Fel http://www.wowdb.com/spells/172895 - Ko'ragh expels fel magic into 3 random players, marking them for 12 sec. When Expel Magic: Fel expires, it creates a line of fel energy between where the wearer gained this effect and where the effect expired. The fel energy persists for 1.5 min, and inflicts 95,000 Fire damage to all players within it.
Expel Magic: Arcane http://www.wowdb.com/spells/162186 - Ko'ragh blasts a player with corrupted Arcane energy that marks their current location every 0.5 sec. for 10 sec. After 1.5 sec., the marked location explodes, inflicting 143,000 Arcane damage to all players within 5 yards. In addition, this effect increases Physical damage taken by 100%.
Expel Magic: Frost http://www.wowdb.com/spells/172747 - Ko'ragh expels an orb of Frost that inflicts 64,350 Frost damage to all players. The orb persists for 20 sec and slows movement speed of all players within 30 yards by up to 85%. The snare effect of Expel Magic: Frost decreases as a player stands farther away from the expelled orb.
<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/healer.png" title="Healer" /> Expel Magic: Shadow http://www.wowdb.com/spells/162184 - Ko'ragh expels Shadow magic, inflicting all players with a heal absorption effect that prevents up to 50,000 healing received.

<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/deadly.png" title="Deadly" /> <img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/important.png" title="Important" /> Overflowing Energy http://www.wowdb.com/spells/161612 - Arcane energy bleeds from the rune stone, inflicting 150,000 Arcane damage to enemies it comes into contact with. If the energy reaches the ground, it explodes, inflicting 49,500 Arcane damage to all enemies.<br/><br/>This effect pierces all immunities and damage reductions.
Dominating Power http://www.wowdb.com/spells/163472 - Imperator Mar'gok uses the power of the rune stone to mind control all players that come into contact with Overflowing Energy. This effect grants immunity to all Magic and is removed when the player is brought below 20% health.

<img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/interruptable.png" title="Interruptable" /> Forfeit Power http://www.wowdb.com/spells/163517 - Players mind controlled by Dominating Power attempt to forfeit 5% of their shield and give Ko'ragh 5% of his shield.





Arthas Costume Hotfix
So after looking into it there are a few hotfixes that will be going out early next week to address the Lich King costume. We won't be testing these fixes until Monday, so until they're applied and listed in the Hotfixes blog these are just current intentions. Assuming it all goes to the current plan: the cost is being adjusted down by half, we're ensuring it is indeed 50 charges 20min per charge, and that it's usable outside of the Hallow's End event period. Keep in mind that when the hotfixes go out the cost shown on the vendor won't change, but the item will indeed be purchasable for the hotfixed amount.

Seems rather silly to price it in such a way you have to choose to either purchase that, or the pets and other things because of there only being about 650 candy thats physically possible to get.
It's intentionally priced as being sort of the 1 item someone would want to go after if they really want to turn into the Lich King every once in a while. It won't be what everyone wants to chase after, and that's ok. However, pets are account-wide of course, and so you can get multiple items if you're participating in the event on multiple characters.

When Rejuv is applied it lasts for 12 seconds, if you refresh it lasts for 16, is this intended?
Yes this is intended. All player cast HoTs and DoTs work this way in warlords. It allows you to refresh in last 1/3 without a loss holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522487380985405440

Traps arm instantly now, but the travel time makes chaining CC mandatory again. Is this against your design?
It isn't against our design. We still like that it's possible to avoid if you see it coming. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522419454786174976
would rather see a cast time added to trap launcher instead of travel time. This promotes chaining cc, which is against design goal
Chaining CC is a part of WoW PvP. It's definitely part of the design. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522487014218665985

Any chance of getting old Wrath pvp weapons on vendors? Currently only s8 is available
we didn't get it done. Still want to. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522174483478487040

PvP
alternatively, was it due to poor player interest in them? would you say the attempt to relaunch them at 90 didn't work out?
Both good questions. Wintergrasp and Tol Barad were great when they were current content. But interest in them is low. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522234932001648641
In order for them to be a good experience, we feel like a lot of work would need to go into them server tech, design rework etc holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522235164202520577
We feel that effort is better spent elsewhere, creating great new content for everyone. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522235237703499777
This conflicts with the revamped 1-60 experience back in cata. Maybe stick to a design philosophy instead of swaying?
Disagree. I think reworking the level up experience almost everyone experiences is different from preserving events. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522387405978890240

Lore
In the Gul'dan and Stranger comic, why is Gul'dan chained?
He didn't know what was going to happen to him when he drank the blood. Did you like the comic? DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/522491776188170240

worgen fan here. Any news on the quest line in WoD where Tess looks into a disease the worgen are suffering from? Still in game?
It was removed during a zone re-vamp. The story may come back later in some form. Tess is a cool character. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/522495106440392704

In the beta, Frostwall defenders are ugh... High elves ! Is it intended ? Otherwise, will it ever be corrected ?
Not intentional. Let me get a bug in and try to fix for release. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/522498388890120192

Khadgar has always been my favorite character however now ye turned him into a traitor to the Alliance. Are you proud?

Are Cloud Serpents Beasts or Dragonkin? Adult mobs are labeled beasts but some of the young are labeled dragonkin.
We're inconsistent in-game, but they're not really related to the classic Azeroth dragonflights. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/522499869219373056


Computers - Setup of the Month
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolution, we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/ssdgraph.gif are trending slightly downward over the past few months, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. 

The GTX 980 and 970 have been released! The 970 is a good value, but it is almost always out of stock. 

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&tag=mmochamp-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A. 

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 4790K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx and Nvidia http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/290-Computer for any extra questions!
