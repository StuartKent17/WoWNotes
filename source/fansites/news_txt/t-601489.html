This probably means more PvP balancing in 2.2 (with ingame voice chat, hurray)<br>

Druid post<br>
<br>
The Druid class is somewhat under-represented in the Arenas, which there of course are various reasons for. The developers are looking into the Druids overall performance in the Arenas, so I would say that it is too soon to give up on your Druid just yet. :-)<br>
<br>
Rogue post<br>
<br>
[...]But in regards to Rogue performance in the Arenas in general, this is something that the developers are looking into. I do not have much more info on this available at this moment in time, but we will keep you informed as soon as we know more about the developers plans to improve the Rogue situation in Arenas.<br>
<br>
Many of you have posted good ideas for ways to improve performance and the Rogue class in general, and I would just like to thank you all for that. Keep letting us know what you think, and please keep posting your suggestions :-)<br>

Nihilum vs Millenium<br>
Fragbite (http://www.fragbite.com/) released a video of the Nihilum (http://www.nihilum.eu) vs Millenium (http://www.millenium-source.org) match held during the ESWC in France. The quality isn&apos;t outstanding but it&apos;s decent enough to be watched ^^<br>
