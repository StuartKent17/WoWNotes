Warlords of Draenor Live in the EU
Warlords of Draenor is live in the EU! The Iron Horde appears to be winning the battle right now, as there are connection issues on all realms. If you are having trouble mounting, you need to head back to Khadgar 
Due to technical issues players may experience latency or loss of connection on all realms. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause and thank you for your patience while this is being resolved.
