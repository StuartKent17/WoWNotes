 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Clarification:  Does the 5% strength for Fallen Crusader apply to Frost only? Or both Unholy and Frost?
That's a Frost perk. Celestalon 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Storm Elemental abilities now do 15% & 30% rather than 215% & 428%. Possible change to inherited SP for elemental pets?
Yes, they inherit 100% SP now. Celestalon

Honestly I am getting sick of this topic never being answered so I'll ask once more. Will the wep size on fem humans be reduced?
No holinka 

....Sorry for the novel -cough-
You'll likely see many more variants of things used when the transmog revamp happens Muffinus 
As in it'll be part of the system to acquire alternative skins, or a whole bunch of pieces are being put in? TY 4 response btw
Not decided yet, we'll have more info eventually Muffinus

With the removal of the legendary chain. Will the vender that sells cloaks for os be going too?
The cloak/metagem/etc. vendor will remain accessible to those who have unlocked those items via quests WatcherDev

The Sinestra FoS has been unattainable since Mists. Same deal for the Ra-den one once Draenor unlocks. WatcherDev

Gear: 2200, Enchant 2400 Tabard/Cloak: 2600 holinka 

Is blacklisting going away in WoD? Just heard this on the forums, but you know rumors..
Blacklisting is staying. Call to Arms is going away. holinka 

Garrisons
if you build the "Enchanting" building in your garrision do you get the ability to disenchant or do you still need an alt? 
You get a disenchanting font for disenchanting all of the things! Muffinus 

So I'm exalted wit the Exodar, and I have a Level 3 Barracks for Draenei guards. What happens if I change out the Barracks?
You keep your guards, but need to make your 'rax again if you want to change them again. Muffinus
