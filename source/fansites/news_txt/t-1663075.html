Classes<br>
Are any classes going to be reworked? or can we expect how skills and mechanics are now to be good for this expansion.<br>
It depends on what you mean by &quot;rework&quot; but you won&apos;t see complete overhauls mid-expansion for sure. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/543838814360576001))<br>

Something happened to our quest design team. Something bad. http://t.co/BewWfec2fN (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/543519756502847489))<br>
Didn&apos;t realize quest design team role-played thru quests. Makes me wonder about all those poop quests.<br>
I swear to God I played the Pandaren start area in my Panda spirit hood. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/543634695494201346))<br>

Is the perk for having a lvl 3 Inn supposed to give missions with such low XP rewards? If so how do we revert back to lvl 2?<br>
These missions don&apos;t take the place of any other missions, there&apos;s no downside to having them. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/543825704568123395))<br>

rerolled resto shaman and got Chain Lightning. Also disheartening to have spec not matter at all.<br>
Spec matters for 2 things: abils they can get, and their basic attack (e,g,healers do lower dmg, have a heal) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/543937811888340992))<br>
