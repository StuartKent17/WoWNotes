Patch 6.2 - Warlock Demon Models<br>
It looks like Warlocks will be getting the updated versions of the demon models we posted yesterday (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4914-Patch-6-2-Demon-Models-Flying-Feedback-Blue-Posts-Vanilla-Servers-DLC-490), as well as the Voidlord (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/may/voidlord2.jpg). Keep in mind that the creature that looks similar to a Felhunter in that post is not actually a Felhunter. <br>

Upcoming Live Q&amp;A with Ion Hazzikostas<br>
On Saturday, June 6th, at 2:00 PM Pacific time, I&apos;ll be sitting down with Lead Game Designer Ion &quot;Watcher&quot; Hazzikostas to answer your questions about Warlords of Draenor -- including the upcoming 6.2 Content Patch, as well as lessons we&apos;ve learned throughout Warlords of Draenor&apos;s development.<br>
<br>
We&apos;ll be sharing more information, including how to submit your questions, in a full announcement on Monday, but wanted to give the community as much advance notice as possible regarding the date and time of this upcoming Q&amp;A. We&apos;ll see you there!<br>
<br>
The question is will he be answering real questions or just give us more fluff as usual?<br>
If Tough Questions doesn&apos;t mean actual Tough Questions, you have every right to yell at me on twitter/IRL. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/603365165036392448))<br>
Appreciate the response. I really hope we can get some clarity. Lots of trust lost recently by the fans. Makes me sad, really.<br>
Really it&apos;s not for a lack of not hearing you. Flight, endgame content, getting out of garrisons, pvp, all good feedback. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/603366951130378240))<br>
<br>
&quot;Tough&quot; pre-approved questions. Give me, and the player base a break. It&apos;s all a PR stunt.<br>
Lots of people have lots of legitimate questions about 6.2 &amp; we&apos;d like to spend some time addressing them. (CM_Zarhym (https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/603353888083804161))<br>

Flying Feedback<br>
Thanks everyone for your continued feedback and discussion on the topic. The development team is actively reading it and discussing it, and will certainly continue to in the days ahead. We&#x2019;re all as passionate about working on WoW as we are playing it, and we&apos;re dedicated to making it a great experience. As always, we&apos;ll let you know if we have any further information to share. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/374447-watcher-says-no-flying-in-wows-future-iv/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17605632090?page=17#331))<br>

@WarcraftDevs and Lack of Developer Communication<br>
the really heartbreaking thing for me is the silence. Pre-WOD etc were talking to us and engaging us.<br>
I know it&apos;s difficult when you don&apos;t receive direct responses, but trust that we do hear your feedback. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/600456565527687168))<br>
And trust that we recognize when systems that we&apos;ve developed are weak or unfruitful. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/600456687271550976))<br>
We&apos;re just as interested in providing you a wealth of enjoyable content as you are in having it. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/600458762881642496))<br>
We continue to recommend because it acts as a single source of feedback for all WoW Devs. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/600458816572948481))<br>
Routing through the single outlet keeps information less fragmented and more open to the entire community. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/600458957774163970))<br>
That being said, thank you! We greatly appreciate all the passionate feedback. It&apos;s very important to us. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/600459000094658560))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
that weapon even though casters can obtain a 710 (example) from Archimonde? Is this correct?<br>
Typically, soon after a caster gets a 705 from Normal Archimonde, a shaman will have access to a 705 from Heroic Kormrok. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601103690234138624))<br>
<br>
Concern rewarding the ilvl rampup in HFC: wont the loot from the first bosses become obsolete when the raid is on farm?<br>
We&#x2019;re adding quests to unlock shortcuts that will allow raids to skip ahead if desired once they&#x2019;ve cleared a few times. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601104491354525697))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
hi, will the Ironhoof Destroyer mount still drop (100% drop rate) from blackhand mythic when Patch 6.2 goes live?<br>
Yes. We typically wait to reduce end-boss mount drop rates until a new expansion arrives. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/600839719677657088))<br>
<br>
Dungeons<br>
Will ilevels in mythic be scaled down like challenge mode dungeons are?<br>
No, all your items will work as they would anywhere else. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/600839849143177217))<br>
<br>
It seems that mythic dungeon bosses can be bonus-rollable, can&apos;t they? If yes, with the new coin or the old one?<br>
Yes. The new Seals of Inevitable Fate will allow for bonus rolls on Mythic dungeon bosses. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601103262415073280))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
I still have a blue +10 frost resist cloak from when Lokholar dropped loot on like week 1 #LFGKorrak #AlteracValley #He&apos;sEvadingAgain (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/600563390323564545))<br>
I thought I was crazy for thinking AV used to drop loot back in the day!<br>
Guess what is a bad idea? Incentivizing your opponent to kill you to make big bosses you can loot #EmergentGameplay (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/600564115426381824))<br>
I prefer that design to the one incentivizing your opponent to actively avoid you <br>
Not going to disagree with you, I miss the 24-hour battles sometimes. Did you like WG/TB/Ashran better? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/600565501727789056))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
With loot scaling with progress, will the garrison cache also limit to the next boss only? #Warcraft<br>
No, the mission cache can contain items from any boss in that difficulty. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601109297716572160))<br>

&lt;/div&gt; When negative behavior occurs, we know that the faster a player receives feedback, the better their chances of reforming. With that in mind, we&#x2019;re building and iterating on a new instant feedback system that delivers actionable feedback and appropriate punishment to players that need it most. In the future, we expect instant feedback to take on rewards as well, but in step one we&#x2019;re focused on reform-oriented feedback and punishment.<br>
<br>
The system&#x2019;s initial tests kick off today in NA and take aim at verbal harassment. The system delivers reform cards (notifications that link evidence of negative behavior with the appropriate punishment) that help players address their negative behavior. Your reports help the instant feedback system understand and punish the kind of verbal harassment the community actively rejects: homophobia, racism, sexism, death threats, and other forms of excessive abuse. These harmful communications will be punished with two-week or permanent bans within fifteen minutes of game&#x2019;s end. Here&#x2019;s how it works:<br>
<br>
<br>
Teammates or opponents of the offending player send reports and the system validates them to make sure they aren&#x2019;t false<br>
The system examines the case and determines whether the behavior deserves rejection or punishment based on community-driven standards of behavior<br>
The system fires a reform card through email, sharing the chat log of the offending player (we scrub other players&#x2019; names and chat logs) and the punishment for the behavior<br>
<br>
<br>
The player behavior team will be on deck, hand-reviewing the first few thousand cases the instant feedback system sorts through. If the test goes smoothly, we expect instant feedback to roll out to all regions shortly. Like we mentioned up top, this test marks the beginning for instant feedback. Upgrades will allow it to shoulder more reform and punishment responsibilities and even reward positive play. Here&#x2019;s a peek at where we&#x2019;re headed:<br>
<br>
<br>
In-client reform cards<br>
Follow-up notifications for players who reported a player who was punished<br>
Upgrades for chat and ranked restrictions<br>
Upgrades to recognize negative gameplay behaviors like intentional feeding<br>
Recognition of honors and rewards for positive behaviors and communication<br>
<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll hang around the comments to answer questions and hear your feedback. We&#x2019;ll come back soon to share more about the vision for player behavior, including plans for the Tribunal.<br>
<br>
I really think this is going down the wrong path. Having it weight the words said differently isn&apos;t a positive feature. Vocabulary doesn&apos;t efficiently correlate to negativity, and often the most innocuous words are the most negative. Gg easy is far more infuriating and negative than getting called a fag ever was. I hope efforts are put forth to try and actually curb negative behavior, not just try and punish people for saying naughty words. We&apos;re not children here. Remove the afks, the feeders, and the incessant negative players. Don&apos;t try and police language.<br>
The system does not just look at words, and tries to learn phrases. In fact, &quot;gg easy&quot; is considered a very negative phrase by the system today.<br>
<br>
Secondly, we do have testing in place for the system to identify and punish intentional feeders and other forms of gameplay toxicity.<br>
<br>
Lyte how do you plan on solving False Positives? Especially when it&apos;s done automatically, and within 15 minutes of a game ending, there are sure to be issues. Do you have a certain criteria that they need to fill to get automatically banned/perma-banned? <br>
The system analyzes in-game data like chat logs, and then assesses reports and tries to &quot;validate&quot; the reports. In addition, every report and honor in the game is teaching the system about behaviors and what looks OK or not OK, so the system continuously learns over time. If a player shows excessive hate speech (homophobia, sexism, racism, death threats, so on) the system might hand out a permanent ban to the player for just 1 game. But, this is pretty rare!<br>
<br>
In terms of false positives, we recently flew in Player Support and Player Behavior team members from all around the world to hand-review thousands of chat logs, and we saw false positive rates in the 1 in 6000 range. So, we know the system isn&apos;t perfect, but we think the accuracy is good enough to launch.<br>
&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&lt;/div&gt;</div></div>
