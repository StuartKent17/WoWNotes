Blue Tweets
So I crafted a lego prior to 7.2.5 and it has iLVL 970. I wish to sell it on AH, how do I make it 1000 iLVL?
The impression that Legendaries could go to item level 1000 was a bug in the Dungeon Journal. At this time, item level 970 is the maximum. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/888130876642545665

Why has there been no official word regarding the Priest class mount trail effect nerf? Can we compromise? Miss the feathers!
We removed only a few feathers* that were reaching the player camera. *per the artist, these aren't "feathers", but "magical owl dander". WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/887795204492845058


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Purely design wise, what was your favorite WoW class to work on?
Death knight, no question. It was just a blank slate, so we felt free to challenge every idea, rather than having a few years of built up expectations and history to contend with. I don’t mean to sound like those factors should be dismissed - far from it. It was just nice to start from very little. A death knight needs a sword, and there’s something about it being cold, and whatever abilities the character had in War3. That was about it.

If that feels like a cop-out answer, then my next one is probably warrior. I always enjoyed how the WoW warrior felt like a mix between a soldier and a gladiator and a bit of barbarian. It was fun to work with the rage mechanic, even when it could be really frustrating to tune sufficiently.
