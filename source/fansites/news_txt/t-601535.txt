LFG Comic #60 and #61 are out, Dark Legacy reached its 100th comic ! The Big AT Adventure from Actiontrip is also finished and I suggest that you read it entirely 22 Pages long, the link will point to the first page, click "Next part" on the top of the page


   
   

You'll also notice that the blades of azzinoth are on the Actiontrip comic thumbnails ... Well, that's a pretty good timing, because Method  dropped the [item=32837] on their first Illidan kill. It's not the first drop but it seems that the droprate isn't that bad. Only 13 guilds killed Illidan for the moment
