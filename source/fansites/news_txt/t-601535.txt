You'll also notice that the blades of azzinoth are on the Actiontrip comic thumbnails ... Well, that's a pretty good timing, because Method http://smiler.se/method/portal/ dropped the [item=32837] on their first Illidan kill. It's not the first drop but it seems that the droprate isn't that bad. Only 13 guilds killed Illidan for the moment
