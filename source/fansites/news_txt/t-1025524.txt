Boubouille2011-11-20, 05:08 AMDiablo 3 - Today we have the datamined Loading Screens from Act 1 through Act 4 http://www.diablofans.com/news/993-act-1-through-4-loading-screens-wiki-digest-2/ and a couple of wiki highlights.

WoW Turns 7! Anniversary Tabard now available in-game
World of Warcraft turns 7 this year see World of Warcraftâ€™s Seventh Anniversary! http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2558-World-of-Warcraft%E2%80%99s-Seventh-Anniversary-New-WoW-TV-Spot and to celebrate, players will be awarded a tabard and the WoW's 7th Anniversary http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5863/wows-7th-anniversary/ Feat of Strength. The celebration lasts from November 20 to December 3, this is a visual tabard and it will not unequip your current tabard. 

Update - I just realized that the "Celebration Package" item summoning the tabard requires the 7th anniversary event to be active, it most likely means that this item will expire. Might want to wait for a blue confirmation on that before you go through all your alts to get it.
