Make WoW nicer with a few console commands<br>
As surprising as it sounds, some people found a way to make WoW look nicer just by typing a few console commands. The best way to do that would be to create a macro with the following commands. <br>
<br>
/console groundEffectDensity 256<br>
/console groundEffectDist 140<br>
/console detailDoodadAlpha 100<br>
/console horizonfarclip 2112<br>
/console farclip 777<br>
/console characterAmbient 0<br>
/console smallcull 0<br>
/console skycloudlod 3 <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Obviously, it will probably lower your framerate a little and you can revert the changes by typing the following :<br>
<br>
/console groundEffectDensity 16<br>
/console groundEffectDist 1<br>
/console horizonfarclip 1305<br>
/console farclip 177<br>
/console characterAmbient 1<br>
/console smallcull 1<br>
/console skycloudlod 1<br>
/console detailDoodadAlpha 1 <br>

Season 4 - 2 More items<br>
Another day, another batch of season 4 items activated on servers because of a few errors made by GMs. This time we&apos;ve got a preview of the Warlock and Druid sets, note that some of the names have been blurred to prevent these people from receiving a hundred of whisps each hour. (And actually, I don&apos;t think any of them still have the items)<br>

Very important note : Most of these items have &quot;outdated&quot; stats, the armor on the sets should be slightly higher. The only armor set up-to-date with the latest version of the PTR is the Paladin one. Keep in mind that all of them are from PTRs and could have been changed since then. <br>

Arena Wait Times - Feedback<br>
Since the release of the 2.4 patch we&apos;ve been working to tighten up the changes made to help address longer wait times when attempting to get into an arena match. While we&apos;re fairly certain it&apos;s been successful, we&apos;d like your feedback relating to the wait times, how they were before the patch and how they&apos;ve been lately.<br>
<br>
As our changes have been continual since patch 2.4, please only leave feedback if you&apos;ve played in the last week.<br>

Arena Tournament posts<br>
Nothing really interesting but ... better than nothing. <br>
[b]Wait, seeing as tomorrow is the end of the practice phase, will we have to pay another $20 to keep playing after tomorrow?<br>
No. If you registered for the First Qualification Round you will play until the end of that round. You will only need to register again to continue playing after the First Qualifier is completed and the Second Qualifier is beginning.

Hey i was wondering if there was any place to see who&apos;s like the top threes top twos and top fives?<br>
Yes - characters, ladders, and all the regular stats you see on the Armory should be available for the Tournament Realms now. If something is missing, let us know and we&apos;ll try to resolve it.

&quot;Servants of the Betrayer&quot; Becomes Third World of Warcraft TCG Set to Sell-Out in the U.S.<br>
Continuing to remain one of the top trading card games (TCG) in the industry, Upper Deck Entertainment (UDE) is pleased to announce today that the U.S. version of the World of Warcraft&#xAE; TCG&#x2019;s expansion set, Servants of the Betrayer&#x2122;, is sold-out! Servants of the Betrayer is the third English-language set in the TCG series to be sold out since the game&#x2019;s debut in 2006, joining Fires of Outland&#x2122; and Feast of Winter Veil&#x2122; in a line of sold-out sets.<br>
<br>
Featuring brand-new, highly sought-after Loot&#x2122; card items (which provides unique cosmetic upgrades to online characters), it&#x2019;s no wonder Servants of the Betrayer has sold out quantities in the U.S. The set&#x2019;s Loot card items include: an epic X-51 Nether-Rocket flying mount, which allows players to fly through the skies of Outland; a Personalized Weather Maker, which gives players their very own weather system ranging from sunshine and rain, to snow; and the first-ever Super Common Loot card, Papa Hummel&#x2019;s Old Fashion Biscuits, which allows lucky players to double the size of their cosmetic pet! <br>
<br>
In addition to the uniquely coded Loot cards, Servants of the Betrayer also features Traitor Heroes, Aldor and Scryer quests, and unreleased abilities for players&#x2019; decks. Each pack includes 19 game play cards and 1 UDE Point card. The set becomes the fifth booster set in the World of Warcraft TCG series.<br>
<br>
Players can look forward to the next expansion set in the TCG series, The Hunt of Illidan&#x2122; (July 2008) and the new Black Temple&#x2122; Raid Decks (September 2008),which will feature a new 12-card new Treasure Pack, and for the first time ever, expanded tournament-legal content in the Raid Deck. <br>
