Yet another beta build is headed our way tonight. <br>
The Beta realms are currently shutting down for maintenance in order to deploy a new build. I&apos;ll be updating this thread with information and time estimates as I receive them. I don&apos;t have an ETA yet, but these pushes usually take at least 8 hours, if not more.

Patch 6.0.2 PTR Notes - Sep 18 Update<br>
It looks like the current Brawler&apos;s Guild season will end with Patch 6.0.2, so be sure to get any achievements before they become Legacy achievements (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements?filter-search=Pandaria+campaign). <br>
World Environment<br>
Creatures<br>
<br>
Access to Ordon Sanctuary or eligibility for loot from Ordos no longer requires players to have completed the Legendary Cloak questline.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quests<br>
Legendary Cloak Quest Line<br>
<br>
As part of the transition from Mists of Pandaria to Warlords of Draenor, players who are not already on the Legendary Cloak quest line will no longer be able to begin it.<br>
Players that are already on the Legendary Cloak quest line have until November 13 to complete Wrathion&apos;s tasks and challenges. Once Warlords of Draenor launches, the Legendary Cloak quest line will be gone entirely&#x2014;the quests and the cloak will no longer be obtainable, and any related in-progress quests will be cleared from the quest log.<br>
Characters will continue to be able to repurchase rewards they&apos;ve already obtained (such as the epic cloak and Legendary metagem) from the quest line.<br>
A Test of Valor has been removed. Players on Wrathion&#x2019;s Legendary quest line will now skip ahead to the next step.<br>
Full details of the changes can be found in the blog titled: Legendary Cloak Quest Last Chance &#x2013; Black Prince Buff Extended (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/15910699/).<br>
<br>
<br>
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br>
Siege of Orgrimmar<br>
<br>
Garrosh Hellscream<br>
<br>
Siege of Orgrimmar achievements will be relabeled according to the new difficulty structure (e.g. &#x201C;Heroic: Malkorok&#x201D; will now be &#x201C;Mythic: Malkorok&#x201D;). Credit for these achievements will be retroactively awarded to players who earned them prior to Patch 6.0.2.<br>
<br>
<br>
Battlegrounds and Arenas<br>
<br>
PvP Season 15 comes to an end with the launch of Patch 6.0.2. (Date has not been determined yet.)<br>
<br>
Conquest Points will be converted into Honor Points, and any Honor above the cap of 4,000 will be converted into in-game currency at a rate of 35 silver per point.<br>
Season 15 items will have Conquest costs converted into Honor Points equivalent to their previous Conquest Point cost, with the exception of any items that have a rating requirement.<br>
Season 15 items with rating requirements will no longer be available for purchase.<br>
Note that Arena and Rated Battleground matches will not be available until PvP Season 16 begins.<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Vendors who sell PvE Heirloom items for Justice Points have taken a vacation. PvE Heirlooms will continue to be available at the Darkmoon Faire and Trial of the Crusader, and PvP Heirlooms will still be able to be purchased for Honor.<br>
<br>
Shield and off-hand Heirloom items will be added to PvE Heirloom vendors at the Darkmoon Faire.<br>
Discussion for this topic can be found in the forum thread titled: Heirloom Vendor Change in Patch 6.0.2.<br>
<br>
<br>
Brawler&apos;s Guild<br>
<br>
Season 1 of the Brawler&apos;s has come to a close and associated achievements have been converted into Feats of Strength.<br>
Fights will be unavailable while the Brawler&apos;s Guild is being refitted in preparation for Season 2 (available after Warlords of Draenor has launched.)<br>
Account-wide membership in Brawler&apos;s Guild will carry over to Season 2. Once a brawler, always a brawler!<br>
<br>
<br>
Mount Journal<br>
<br>
Grand Expedition Yak&#x2019;s reforge vendor (Mystic Birdhat) has been replaced with a vendor that offers transmogrification services.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Upcoming Raid and Challenge Mode Testing<br>
FEEDBACK: Challenge Modes<br>
Starting with this beta build, all Challenge Mode dungeons are accessible. You can access them either by zoning in manually, or by setting difficulty to Challenge and speaking with Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade (in major cities or your garrison).<br>
<br>
Tuning is definitely a work in progress. Some things are brutally hard, bordering on impossible. Some of the mob kill counts are off, and we&apos;d like to hear about that - if you fall short of the kill count without using Invis/Shroud to skip any packs, or if you&apos;re completing the kill requirement well before the end of the dungeon, let us know. And of course, Gold/Silver/Bronze times are very much placeholder.<br>
<br>
Please use this thread for any feedback and reports of issues you encounter. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/339915-feedback-challenge-modes/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14505830447?page=1#1))<br>

Raid Testing Schedule - September 19<br>
On Friday, September 19, we will continue Warlords Mythic raid testing. As always given the nature of beta, it is quite possible that there will be technical or gameplay issues that disrupt the testing. Thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.<br>
<br>
Mythic difficulty is designed for a fixed-size 20-player group.<br>
<br>
Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below on all Beta servers.<br>
<br>
Friday, September 19<br>
<br>
Beastlord Darmac - Mythic Foundry<br>
10:30 PDT (13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST)<br>
<br>
Iron Maidens - Mythic Foundry<br>
15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 24:00 CEST)<br>
<br>
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, fire, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.
