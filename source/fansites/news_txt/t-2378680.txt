Patch 7.3.5 Hotfixes - February 20
Classes

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Fixed a bug that allowed Demonic Gateways to be placed in unintended spots.



Class Halls

Argus missions that award Blood of Sargeras  now cost 600 more Order Hall Resources. This will not be correctly reflected in the Legion Companion App until its next version update.

Developers’ notes: Completing these missions with bonus rewards previously returned more Order Hall Resources than they cost. Rather than reduce their yield, we’ve increased the cost of the missions so that players with ample Order Hall Resources can convert them to tradeskill materials.



Dungeons and Raids

Pit of Saron

The health of most enemies in Pit of Saron has been reduced by 50% in Timewalking.



Items
If you have all Legion Legendary items for your class, consuming a class-specific item that generates a Legion Legendary item will now always generate a token for another class.
Heritage of the Ren'dorei now contains the Ren'dorei Cloak.


NPCs

Hatecoil Spitespeaker should no longer instantly respawn.
Princess Poobah should no longer unexpectedly stop offering quests.


Quests

"The Emerald Dreamcatcher" is no longer weekly.
The starting location for "Teldrassil: The Burden of the Kaldorei" should now correctly be displayed on the map.
Mature Silkwing again have a chance to softly drop Iridescent Wings for “The Softest Wings”.




Loot Rules for Transmog Runs
Since the Patch 7.3.5 change to use personal loot rules in leveling dungeons, we’ve heard a lot of feedback from Transmog hunters concerned about how this has affected the ability to collect appearances from older content. We hear you, and agree it’s a problem, so we’ve been working on a more robust solution for Battle for Azeroth.

Once these updates are implemented, entering a dungeon or raid that is trivial for you i.e.: your character is 10 or more levels higher than the dungeon or raid’s intended level will activate a “legacy loot mode.” That loot mode will work like this:


The number of items dropped by bosses will be the same as it would have been if you were in a full party. So if you’re in a 5-player dungeon, you’ll get 5 players’ worth of loot.
For raids with a flexible raid size such as Raid Finder, this will act as though there were 20 players in the raid.
All items on the loot table will have a chance to drop, not just the ones that are designated for your spec.
If you have multiple players in the group, the loot will be split among those players, but be tradeable. For example, if you’re clearing with one other player and kill a boss that should drop 4 items, you’ll each be able to pick up two items and trade them between each other if you like.

While the personal loot change was a key part of what allowed us to expand leveling dungeons to encompass a wider range of levels, and we’re happy with it in that environment, we recognize that it’s not a great experience for those who enjoy clearing older content for transmog, and hope that these changes will make that more enjoyable once they’re complete. 

Thanks again for all of the feedback!


WoW MVP Program - Recruitment Now Open!
Hey all!

As we announced last week, we are making some changes to the World of Warcraft MVP Program for North America. With this, one of the biggest changes is going to be in how we recruit our MVPs. 

Going forward, we will be using an application-based recruitment system, which will allow us to ask targeted questions to candidates, as well as close and open recruitment as needed within a given period.

Today we will be opening our first recruitment period in 2018. You can find a link to the application here.

Please answer any discussion prompts thoroughly, and, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask us here. We look forward to reviewing applications over the next few weeks and we wish all of you applying the best of luck!

NOTE: The World of Warcraft North American MVP Program is only open to applicants from the North American service region including the United States and Canada. Applicants from Oceania and South America, including Mexico, will need to refer to their specific MVP Programs where applicable. Any applicants from outside the designated regions will be discarded.

> "Should You happen to strongly disagree with a Blizzard poster or another MVP over a topic on the forums, the discussion is best handled in private."

What is meant by "strongly" in this context? Is it an implication that it may threaten your ability to discuss it in a purely constructive manner or are you actually suggesting that if MVPs are particularly concerned about an issue that they should go directly to Blizzard rather than post it publicly, as any other forum poster would?

Additionally, if I fill out half of this application and don't submit it, is any record of it kept? I do not wish to apply. I simply want to see what all is in the application.
As an FYI, that wording is from our original MVP Program legalese, and hasn't been changed for this recruitment period.

In this context, I think it lends that we expect that our MVPs will be passionate posters on a variety of topics. Sometimes, its easy to see that what one may post in those kinds of discussions could disrupt your ability to be a constructive member of the community, as required by the program. We would advise that our MVPs should message those disagreements with other MVPs or CMs to us privately so we can try to resolve them without any breach of the program terms that may lead to forum tirades, etc. The forums aren't a place for drama between CMs, MVPs, posters, or otherwise.

The final page of the application will automatically submit the form once you see the screen that notes it has been submitted, yes. The last page with form content is the one with the section asking for a response to a post on a variety of listed community issues. You should be able to go through it up to that question to view what is being asked.

If you'd like us to remove any form content you may have submitted, you can shoot me an email with the basic information you applied with such as your name and battle.net email.

Instead of having paid moderators blizz is going to recruit ppl to work for free, nice
I was going to just delete this, but I wanted to point a few things out because I've seen it elsewhere:

The MVP Program has been a part of the WoW Community for over ten years. In that time, we've had wonderful community volunteers who have worked to help players both on the forums and throughout our community, and I don't see that changing any time soon. Our MVP volunteers will continue to be passionate and dedicated WoW community members who will continue to do the work they've done for a decade.

Blizzard also employs wonderful folks in Community and Customer Support who handle a ton of stuff on you never see in the day-to-day who deserve credit regardless of if you see their work in action or not.

Our MVPs do *NOT* have any powers on the forums that our Moderators or Community Managers have, and just to clarify, having green text gives no forum ability besides... having green text.

So I get that Blizzard has a large number of paid employees we never see who do a lot for the community, and I also get the the WoW MVP role has been around for awhile so it's not like this is some new ground breaking thing. But what I don't get is how does any of this address the point of view that this is Blizzard recruiting people for a job they should be paid for and asking them to do it for free?We aren't recruiting anyone for a "job" here. The MVP program is a volunteer community effort for regular forum posters. We are simply opening entry into that program to a wider audience by having a recruitment application.

The MVP Program recognizes our passionate and constructive posters and asks them to continue contributing to the community, while giving them an avenue to discuss issues with us when needed. This does not change the nature of their usual discourse on the forums, and is mainly targeted at those posters who already devote a lot of time here by their own will.

MVPs do not moderate, facilitate any major amount of feedback past what they do voluntarily, build reports of any kind, etc.
