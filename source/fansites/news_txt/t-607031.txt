2.4.2 Patch Notes http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=6683.0



This post will be updated every few minutes / hours depending on how successful we are at spotting changes. 

Thursday April 24th
A new PvP Trinket as been added to Honor Rewards Medallion of the Alliance http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/epicpvptrinket.jpg. There is obviously a horde version of the item and both of them cost 40 000 Honor Points. 
Epic gems are still sold by Shaani for 15 Badges http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/gem15badge.jpg on PTRs ! This could mean that the official armory showing 10 badges was an error.
The Quest "The Multiphase Survey http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/multispectral.jpg", where you retrieve surveys from Nagrand, no longer gives a [item=35232].
Added screenshots for most of the item changes, also added the new stats for Naturalist's Preserving Cinch http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/naturalistcinch.jpg and Borderland Fortress Grips http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/borderlandgrips.jpg
Added a screenshot for the new Theramore/Stonard portal spells http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/newportals.jpg



Wednesday April 23rd
22:35 CEST - Actually, it looks like new items related to mount "enchantments" are indeed here http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/carrotonastickv2.jpg ... Maybe they just didn't replace the old ones.
21:35 CEST - Added the stats of the Purified Shadowsong Amethyst http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/purifiedshadowsong2.jpg Reward from the Shattered Sun Offensive, Exalted reputation required
21:30 CEST - PTRs are now live and old trinkets http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/mountspeed.jpg haven't been replaced with mount enchantments ![/b][/u] at this time we can assume they will be added later in the game and maybe we won't even see them before WotLK.

16:45 CEST - Added professions changes, added a few details about the [item=11122] in 2.4.2

New Mounts
According to spells and models available in the game files, at least two new mounts have been added to the game.

Swift Zebra
49322 : Swift Zebra - Summons and dismisses a rideable Swift Zebra. This is a very fast mount.

Headless Horseman's Mount
48023 : Headless Horseman's Mount - Summons and dismisses a rideable Headless Horseman's Mount.
48024 : Headless Horseman's Mount, Ground - Summons and dismisses a rideable Headless Horseman's Mount.

The headless horseman mount ",Ground" effect could be the sign of a flying mount, but obviously nothing is confirmed yet.
