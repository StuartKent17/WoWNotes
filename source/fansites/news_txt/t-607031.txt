2.4.2 Patch Notes 



This post will be updated every few minutes / hours depending on how successful we are at spotting changes. 

Thursday April 24th
A new PvP Trinket as been added to Honor Rewards Medallion of the Alliance  There is obviously a horde version of the item and both of them cost 40 000 Honor Points. 
Epic gems are still sold by Shaani for 15 Badges  on PTRs ! This could mean that the official armory showing 10 badges was an error.
The Quest "The Multiphase Survey ", where you retrieve surveys from Nagrand, no longer gives a [item=35232].
Added screenshots for most of the item changes, also added the new stats for Naturalist's Preserving Cinch  and Borderland Fortress Grips 
Added a screenshot for the new Theramore/Stonard portal spells 



Wednesday April 23rd
22:35 CEST - Actually, it looks like new items related to mount "enchantments" are indeed here  ... Maybe they just didn't replace the old ones.
21:35 CEST - Added the stats of the Purified Shadowsong Amethyst  Reward from the Shattered Sun Offensive, Exalted reputation required
21:30 CEST - PTRs are now live and old trinkets  haven't been replaced with mount enchantments ![/b][/u] at this time we can assume they will be added later in the game and maybe we won't even see them before WotLK.

New Mounts
According to spells and models available in the game files, at least two new mounts have been added to the game.

Swift Zebra
49322 : Swift Zebra - Summons and dismisses a rideable Swift Zebra. This is a very fast mount.

Headless Horseman's Mount
48023 : Headless Horseman's Mount - Summons and dismisses a rideable Headless Horseman's Mount.
48024 : Headless Horseman's Mount, Ground - Summons and dismisses a rideable Headless Horseman's Mount.

The headless horseman mount ",Ground" effect could be the sign of a flying mount, but obviously nothing is confirmed yet.
