Not seeing runeforging in #LegionAlpha, can you confirm that they've been taken out? Really liked having diff enchants. 
Runeforging is remaining, it's just learned through a quest which the template characters don't have completed. We'll fix that. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/672495333209849856

Mistweaver mastery currently only procs off of Effuse \ Vivify. Intended? Only has 1 proc from 3 hits of Vivify. Intended?
Should proc from Renewing Mist and Enveloping Mist as well. Only procs from the primary target of Vivify. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/672494650637205504

Is the Pistol shot animation from Rogues final ?
Nope, there's a snazzy custom animation coming in a future build. Hang tight! WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/672532789070200832

im just wondering if the grimoire of supremacy skinned pets will still be in legion aka the wrathgaurd etc
Yep! The alternate demon pets will be available via Minor Glyphs. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/672494961191813121

PvP
are the pvp level brackets going to be changed with legion? https://t.co/69CISDYrL0
PvP level brackets are not changing. The gear provided will scale to your level similar to Timewalking gear. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/672521095312834560

Any change to Ashran loser buff Tues? 7+ groups so far who refuse to ever kill boss for fear of a "debuff"
Killing the faction boss has the exact same effect on the Ashran balance buff as winning one event. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/672532422118912000

I just wanted to ask if you knew if Draenor and Azeroth were in the same solar system? 
Nope! Vast distances of Twisting Nether between them. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/672258848263036928

Why is General Tiras'alan in the Paladin Order Hall? He died at Theramore?
...that clever synth bastard! GET HIM! Real answer: we'll doublecheck and fix DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/672318417219686400

state fel magic isn't arcane. Arcane can be demonic but perhaps not all demonic magic is arcane?
Fel is language of chaos, arcane is language of order. Same spectrum, opposite ends! The RPG books aren't considered canon DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/672523313189548032

Misc
I don't think maths are 'really' essential, but they are of course handy.
I'd say that at least Algebra *is* essential for most forms of game design. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672129362204884992
If for nothing else than that you can develop a better gut for numbers used. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672129619261165568
Sure, you can start with wildly wrong numbers, and iterate, but is slower. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672129788283236352
Could you provide a real example, please?
It can be complex stuff, like figuring out the paths of Cinderstorm, or... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672130090919059457
...it can be simple stuff, like estimating how long people will take to... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672130187220246528
...complete your quest POI, to know how many quests you need to make. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672130303943577600
Or what drop rate to make the quest item, to average the intended kill count Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672130462622474240
Even the less-mathy sorts of designers still use some math. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672130593954508800

Do you think that percentages & statistics are the most common types of math? I mean, the most common type of math involved in game design in general.
Beyond basic math? Across all types of game design, probably, yes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672131741843193856


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Players may feel it's arrogance to claim design is a collaboration then outright dismiss their idea w/o dialogue.
I agree, but it's challenging to have a dialogue with everyone when you are blessed with many players. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671419326575026177

Sometimes I feel this is based on it being rare. If admitting mistake was normal, maybe it'd be different?
If you are constantly admitting mistakes, it is possible over time you develop a reputation as sloppy and careless, I suppose. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671694618958815232

In other industries, huge mistakes can get one fired. Game devs seem to feel entitled to make mistakes freely.
Iteration is at the heart of design, and that means making a lot of mistakes...and then fixing them! OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/670747190264901632

question for you...blizz devs are basically silent nowadays. Was Communication a major reason for the job change for you?
I'll say that Riot's comm philosophy is more simpatico with my own. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/670796357741883393
