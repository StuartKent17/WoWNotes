Not seeing runeforging in #LegionAlpha, can you confirm that they've been taken out? Really liked having diff enchants. 
Runeforging is remaining, it's just learned through a quest which the template characters don't have completed. We'll fix that. WarcraftDevs

Mistweaver mastery currently only procs off of Effuse \ Vivify. Intended? Only has 1 proc from 3 hits of Vivify. Intended?
Should proc from Renewing Mist and Enveloping Mist as well. Only procs from the primary target of Vivify. WarcraftDevs

Where did Shadowform go?! @Celestalon
It's still there, just always on. Celestalon 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Is the Pistol shot animation from Rogues final ?
Nope, there's a snazzy custom animation coming in a future build. Hang tight! WarcraftDevs 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
im just wondering if the grimoire of supremacy skinned pets will still be in legion aka the wrathgaurd etc
Yep! The alternate demon pets will be available via Minor Glyphs. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
are the pvp level brackets going to be changed with legion? 
PvP level brackets are not changing. The gear provided will scale to your level similar to Timewalking gear. WarcraftDevs 

Any change to Ashran loser buff Tues? 7+ groups so far who refuse to ever kill boss for fear of a "debuff"
Killing the faction boss has the exact same effect on the Ashran balance buff as winning one event. WarcraftDevs 

Lore
I just wanted to ask if you knew if Draenor and Azeroth were in the same solar system? 
Nope! Vast distances of Twisting Nether between them. DaveKosak 

Why is General Tiras'alan in the Paladin Order Hall? He died at Theramore?
...that clever synth bastard! GET HIM! Real answer: we'll doublecheck and fix DaveKosak 

state fel magic isn't arcane. Arcane can be demonic but perhaps not all demonic magic is arcane?
Fel is language of chaos, arcane is language of order. Same spectrum, opposite ends! The RPG books aren't considered canon DaveKosak 

Misc
I don't think maths are 'really' essential, but they are of course handy.
I'd say that at least Algebra *is* essential for most forms of game design. Celestalon 
If for nothing else than that you can develop a better gut for numbers used. Celestalon 
Sure, you can start with wildly wrong numbers, and iterate, but is slower. Celestalon 
Could you provide a real example, please?
It can be complex stuff, like figuring out the paths of Cinderstorm, or... Celestalon 
...it can be simple stuff, like estimating how long people will take to... Celestalon 
...complete your quest POI, to know how many quests you need to make. Celestalon 
Or what drop rate to make the quest item, to average the intended kill count Celestalon 
Even the less-mathy sorts of designers still use some math. Celestalon 

Do you think that percentages & statistics are the most common types of math? I mean, the most common type of math involved in game design in general.
Beyond basic math? Across all types of game design, probably, yes. Celestalon 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Players may feel it's arrogance to claim design is a collaboration then outright dismiss their idea w/o dialogue.
I agree, but it's challenging to have a dialogue with everyone when you are blessed with many players. OccupyGStreet 

Sometimes I feel this is based on it being rare. If admitting mistake was normal, maybe it'd be different?
If you are constantly admitting mistakes, it is possible over time you develop a reputation as sloppy and careless, I suppose. OccupyGStreet 

In other industries, huge mistakes can get one fired. Game devs seem to feel entitled to make mistakes freely.
Iteration is at the heart of design, and that means making a lot of mistakes...and then fixing them! OccupyGStreet 

question for you...blizz devs are basically silent nowadays. Was Communication a major reason for the job change for you?
I'll say that Riot's comm philosophy is more simpatico with my own. OccupyGStreet
