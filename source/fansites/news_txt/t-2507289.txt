chaud2019-09-04, 01:45 AMWoW Classic Free Character Moves – Realms
As we previously announced, free character moves will become available in this region very soon. When these free character moves open, player-characters at any level will be able to move:

From -> To

Arugal -> Felstriker
Faerlina -> Heartseeker new realm
Stalagg -> Heartseeker new realm
Herod -> Earthfury new realm
Skeram -> Earthfury new realm
Incendius -> Netherwind
Thalnos -> Netherwind
Fairbanks -> Arcanite Reaper new realm
Whitemane -> Arcanite Reaper new realm
Bigglesworth -> Anathema
Pagle -> Windseeker
Grobbulus -> Deviate Delight


For approximately one day, the new realms will be restricted to only those players using a free character move. After one day, any player may create new characters there. This is to allow players using the free character move service a better chance at retaining the name of the character they’re moving.

We will let you know when the new realms open and free character moves are enabled.

Thank you!
