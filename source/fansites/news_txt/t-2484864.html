World of Warcraft 15th Anniversary In-Game Rewards<br>
Blizzard posted a teaser video of two in-game rewards coming with the 15th Anniversary Event in October. The mount is called the Obsidian Worldbreaker. The Official Press Release (https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/celebrate-15-years-wowr-release-world-warcraftr-classictm-august) clarified just what to expect during the event as well.<br>
Later this year, Blizzard will be rolling out a series of in-game activities in World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth&#x2122;in celebration of the game&#x2019;s 15th anniversary, culminating in a 25-player raid (accessible through Raid Finder) that will pit players against some of the most iconic bosses from throughout the game&#x2019;s history. Players who make it through this epic trial will earn the Obsidian Worldbreaker mount, designed to evoke the terrible visage of the ancient Dragon Aspect Deathwing the Destroyer.<br>
