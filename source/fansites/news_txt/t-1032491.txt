Dragon Soul has four cinematics that show you the important events that occur. The fourth part appears to be missing, but the other three are below.

Update - Just to clarify, the 4th video is as far as I know missing from the game files and we don't know why yet.

Raid Finder Q&A
The new Raid Finder system is now live with patch 4.3. While we’ve shared some details already, we wanted to provide you with this primer on what players can expect from the new system before taking on one of the most epic bosses Azeroth has ever seen.

Q.Who is Raid Finder for?
A. Raid Finder is primarily intended for players who don’t already raid consistently. These are players who may not have had the opportunity to take part in raid content due to scheduling conflicts, playtime constraints, limited access to other raid-capable players, or a lack of experience with higher-end content. These players may want to experience World of Warcraft’s raid content and storyline without being able to commit to the additional time investment of a raiding guild. The Raid Finder is also a great way to quickly and easily gear up alternate characters without having to worry about raid lockouts.

Q. What size raid group will the Raid Finder support and why?
A. Raid Finder will match players up to form a 25-player raid. This allows for a more forgiving experience should errors be made by individual players. Raid Finder groups should be a fun way to experience raid content without feeling too punishing to inexperienced raiders.

Q.What is the Raid Finder difficulty level?
A. Players who take part in Raid Finder groups can expect a similar difficulty level to the Baradin Hold Cataclysm raid.

Q. Are there any character or item level requirements to use the Raid Finder?
A. Yes. You will need to be level 85 with a minimum item level of 372.

Q.What type of loot and items can I expect to get?
A. The items that can be earned are a lower item level than those found in Normal mode Raid Dungeons. Weapons will only be available from Deathwing himself.

Q. How does loot distribution work?
A. All Raid Finder groups determine loot distribution using the “Need Before Greed” system. Unlike Dungeon Finder, players who are identified as rolling need on an item that fits their primary role will be given loot priority over those who play a different role. You can read more about item distribution and loot roll rules here. While Raid Finder raids aren’t locked, players are only eligible to win loot from a boss once per week.

Q. How do I use Raid Finder?
A. You can access Raid Finder through the ‘Raid’ button in the menu at the bottom of the default user interface.

Q. How does Raid Finder populate the raid? Can I invite my friends?
A. Raid Finder will populate the raid with other players who enter the Raid Finder system. Each Raid Finder raid will include two tanks, six healers, and seventeen damage dealers. As the raid is assembled, the Raid Finder will attempt to balance the group according to armor type, which should help ensure a healthy mix of melee and ranged DPS. There are no additional invite capabilities for the raid leader or other members of the raid, however, groups of players are able to queue together, either as a party or a raid, should they wish to raid together.

Q: Does Raid Finder support Real ID friends?
A: With patch 4.3, you can invite Real ID friends to a party and then queue together for the Dragon Soul raid using Raid Finder. You can't, however form a raid with cross-realm Real ID friends before joining the Raid Finder queue. While not currently supported, this is something that we’re interested in implementing in a future update.

Q. What raids are available?
A.The Dragon Soul raid dungeon will be available in the Raid Finder and has been split into two wings. Players will be able to access the first wing at the release of patch 4.3. Deathwing will become available approximately one week later.

Q. Why aren’t older raids available on Raid Finder?
A. Raid Finder is being used to help players access the most current content and tier gear available within the game. Additional options for the system may be considered in the future.

Q. Can I earn any particular currency with Raid Finder?
A. Players can earn up to 500 Valor points per week 250 per wing while utilizing Raid Finder.

Q. How often can I enter the Raid Finder system?
A. Each boss within the Dragon Soul raid can be killed once per week for a chance at loot. Since there are no raid locks, skipping a boss will not impede your ability to attempt that boss in a future raid.


Mists of Pandaria Blue Posts
PvP and Guards / Flying Mounts in Cities
This is actually a main point that we want to address in Mists of Pandaria. We want to make sure that open world PvP is being promoted to its fullest.

We intend to make it so that players will not be afraid of engaging in PvP with the fear of being one-shot by an NPC guard. Hope that this is what you want to hear, as I cannot wait to get into some serious world PvP again.

Balance Druid Feedback
I just wanted to drop into this thread and let you guys know that we currently plan for Moonkins to have two DoTs: Moonfire and Sunfire will be able to stack both applied at the same time.

Lunar Shower will be working differently in the future, so it may be too early for those kinds of concerns. I don't have any details to share at the moment though.

Nature's Grace is still 15%, not 1%, that was just a tooltip issue that will be fixed soon. Revive will also be class-wide, not just for Restoration.

Battle.net Authenticator By-Pass Now Active
A Battle.net Authenticator can represent an excellent way to add an additional layer of security to your Battle.net account. We appreciate that our players make use of their authenticators, and to help make them more convenient, we’ve introduced the authenticator by-pass. Those of you that have World of Warcraft accounts may already be familiar with how it works: when you log into a Blizzard game from the same location, you won’t always be prompted for an authentication code until you attempt to log in from a different location.

The authenticator bypass is active for StarCraft II, and is enabled by default. Those of you who wish to disable this feature can do so by opting out of the bypass on your Battle.net account management page. If you opt out of the by-pass, you will be prompted by Battle.net for an authentication code each time you log in.

LFD Tool Down?
There's a known issue causing the LFG servers to crash, which is kicking people out of queue. A hotfix is already in production and we expect will be implemented this evening.

There's also an issue that's causing long queue times, and again a hotfix is in progress. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/207426/lfd-tool-down / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3657436069?page=1#18

Rated Arenas Still Active?
We've implemented a hotfix that should disable ability to continue to play arena and rated BGs. This was an issue only affecting a small group of realms.

And just to clarify the resets don't occur until Season 11 begins next week. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/207407/so-i-can-queue-for-rated-arena---get-points / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3657275905?page=2#35

Fall of Deathwing not Available Yet
The Fall of Deathwing is not open just yet for the Raid Finder or Heroic. We plan to open this encounter up in approximately one week. We felt it was important to let more people get through the fights in normal difficulty, make videos, strat guides, update their mods, etc. before we let everyone take a crack at Deathwing. We’ll keep you informed when this part of the raid opens up for Raid Finder. Keep in mind that it’s required to complete the first half to be able to queue for the second, so don’t hold back!

372 Item Level for LFR - Excessive?
The Raid Finder is designed to allow players who don't often have the time to commit to a regular raiding schedule a chance at seeing the latest content. With that said, we don't want players who might fall into this category to skip the new five-player dungeons altogether for the Dragon Soul raid.

Raid Finder is below normal and Heroic modes in terms of rewards and difficulty, but the new tier of five-player dungeons should still be stepping stones into the raid.

It shouldn't take the average player "hundreds of hours" to gear up for the Raid Finder version of Dragon Soul, as the Dungeon Finder will quite quickly ramp up your power and gear score.

Implementing the Raid Finder was actually quite a monumental technical feat. We want all future raids to be designed with this third difficulty incorporated, but it'd take quite a bit of time and resources to retrofit the feature into previous raids. In an ideal world that would've happened, but the patch would not have come out this year. And that wasn't an investment we felt would really be ideal in the grand scheme of things.

No High End Gear for Transmogrification
Why do you need to transmog the highest end raid gear? Go solo some content and transmog your stuff to look how you want it to. This feature is the opposite of an intense time requirement customization system. Go do content when you can, build a set from the content you can do, and enjoy making your character look how you want. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/207328/transmog-is-a-joke / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3657425844?page=1#14

Level 60 Gear Models for Transmogrification
The items out in the world Marshals, Grand Marshal’s, High Warlord, etc that use the level 60 PvP art are un-transmogrifiable including the item level 115 stuff that shares the name from Burning Crusade.

In Area 52 a set of vendors has replaced the PvP Vendors who used to live there. Grex Brainboiler, Krixel Pinchwhistle, Tini Smalls, Kezzik the Striker, Big Zokk Torquewrench, and Leeni “Smiley” Smalls. These vendors sell new, transmogrifiable versions of the classic armor to players who have the Feat of Strength for Legionnaire/Knight-Captain or higher under the old PvP system.

There was a bug with the Feat of Strength granting access to these items, but was hotfixed within the last couple of minutes. If you meet the criteria log out and back in and you should be able to access the vendor.

The design intent with the Feat of Strength achievement requirement was specifically to limit these particular art styles to players who earned them through the OG and relentlessly difficult PvP honor system, while keeping the door open to reward them to more people in the future.

In a future patch the items sold by the Area 52 vendors will also be renamed ‘Replica of’ to be more consistent with the items sold by the Darkmoon Faire – they’re currently exact duplicates of the original items that allow transmogrification, which is obviously a bit confusing.

Potentially related, since he’s in the same area, Kezzik the Striker sells inaccessible Season 1 Gladiator’s, Season 2 Merciless Gladiator’s, and Season 3 Vengeful Gladiator’s gear to all players, as the majority of that gear didn’t have restrictions.

Transmogrification Using Items in Void Storage
You've put an item into long-term Void Storage and then want to use it to Transmog? No, it must be in your bags. When an item is in Void Storage it's "locked". All enchants, gems, etc. are stripped. You have to "unlock" it, and bring it into your bags if you wish to use the item in any way, including Transmogrification. 

Void Storage and the gold cost are there ... well one as a potential gold sink although not a super great one, but mainly to give weight to the decision of depositing and removing the items you place in Void Storage because once they're deposited they are "in the void". You should be thinking about and considering when to place items into and remove items from Void Storage. We really didn't want it to become just a new bank system, but a separate long-term storage system for specific types of items.

The connection between the two systems was because with Transmogrification we would essentially be asking people to go get and hold on to a bunch of gear just to customize the way they look. To resolve that we nixxed the key ring which freed up some storage space on a character level, and implemented a way for people to then long-term store those items. A deep-freeze, if you will. It was never the intent to use Void Storage as a staging location you could Transmog from.

And again, I realize how it could have been confusing and do apologize if there was any expectation that these systems were intended to work together directly in any way.

Void Storage
Void Storage provides you with extra space to store items you've used for Transmogrification, or items you might one day want to use for Transmogrification. The idea is to give players a different type of inventory space specifically designed for deep storage of gear.

Players have asked for more inventory space to store gear they love -- whether because it was difficult to obtain, or because the look is too good to throw away -- for mostly nostalgic reasons. Now, with Transmogrification added to the game, this is more of a necessity given that holding onto old gear sets isn't just for keepsake.

But, Void Storage isn't a secondary bank. It's meant for long-term storage of gear so you can hold onto the aesthetics you like, in the event you want to use them for Transmogrification in the future, without worrying about your bag and bank inventory.

That much extra storage space per character is actually a lot of additional data storage on our end. This is why enchants and gems are stripped from items placed in Void Storage, as it's much less data to recall when the extra storage space is only holding onto item IDs.

In any event, the idea wasn't just to give everyone a ton of extra storage space. We want there to be some sort of decision on the part of the player on whether or not to place eligible items in Void Storage. This is why there is a cost associated with each deposit. When all is said and done, you have 80 new slots of space to store the gear you're not using anymore, just in case you want to use any of it for Transmogrification in the future.

Upcoming Portuguese server
We will be opening a Portuguese realm on the Cyclone battlegroup, that will be named Aggra and will be a PvE realm. It will be open for migration and character creation on December 7. More details about this will be communicated to you at a later point. 

You do not need to use the Portuguese language pack to be able to play on this new realm. You will only need a European active World of Warcraft licence.

Right now, only one PvE Portuguese realm is planned to be open. Should we decide to open additional realms PvP or PvE we will let you know.

The European site should be launched in the coming days and we will give you more information on this as soon as possible.

The Portuguese realm will be situated in one of our existing European data centres, and our operations team is always working with the major internet providers in order to ensure the best game experience possible. 

You need to keep in mind that newcomers are sent to PvE realms preferably, and that they provide a much more friendly experience for newer players. While we understand your concerns, this is important for us and we want to offer newcomers a PvE environment. However, if we need more than one realm due to overpopulation of the first, we will open a second one as PvP allowing Free Character Migration to it as well including from the first Portuguese PvE realm. 

In order to ensure minimal queue times when using the Dungeon or Raid Finder tools, the Portuguese-language realm will be a part of the same queues as the English-language realms. Those who choose to use these tools should bear in mind that the resulting groups will likely include English-speaking players. Of course, Portuguese-speaking players can still form groups with friends from their own realm if they would prefer to play with Portuguese-speaking teammates only. Also please note that the PVP queues will work in the same way. As such, you will only meet German players during battlegrounds, on the opposite faction.

Patch 4.3: Customer Support Policy Spotlight
Patch 4.3 is bringing many gameplay features that have vastly changed the policies our support staff follow when answering your tickets. We wanted to give you a heads-up on what the new features are and how they may affect your characters.

Please keep in mind that what’s described below is our general policy. Every petition submitted to us is reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and many factors are considered when making a final determination on the assistance we are able to provide.

Void Storage
Void Storage is a new feature that gives players the ability to store up to 80 items in long-term storage. Storing items using this feature will cost a set amount of gold, reinforcing the nature of the feature as a long-term storage option. Be aware that items stored are stripped of enhancements, like enchants, gems, sockets, reforged stats, and transmogrifications. Some items may also not be eligible for Void Storage, including crafting materials.

We want players to make responsible and thoughtful choices when utilizing Void Storage, and we require confirmation to help ensure that you are depositing items carefully. As you confirm these deposits and withdrawals, please take a moment to ensure that you want to proceed, as customer support will be unable to reimburse gold spent using the Void Storage system. In addition, enhancements lost due to Void Storage will also be ineligible for restoration, so store carefully!

Transmogrification
Transmogrification brings weapon- and armor-appearance customization to World of Warcraft! Like any item enhancement, utilizing this feature will bind the item to your character permanently.

Confirming a transmogrification on an item and thereby binding it to your character will prevent that item from being unbound, refunded, or exchanged by customer support. As with Void Storage, sufficient warnings and visual confirmations of your request are provided. For this reason, we urge you to please be careful when transmogrifying items!

Profession Specializations
With patch 4.3, players will be able to unlearn specializations associated with their primary professions. For example, alchemists who have specialized in Transmutation will be able to unlearn this focus in favor of another. Bear in mind that unlearning a specialization will remove all associated specialized recipes from your character’s spell book.

With all player decisions, we want there to be a measure of responsibility. However, we understand that some of the specialization-specific recipes are no longer available in-game. Should you unlearn a profession specialization and regret the decision, and should you petition in a timely manner and not learn a new specialization in the interim, our staff may be able to help restore recipes lost in this manner.

Raid Finder
Our policies for the Raid Finder will largely mirror our existing stances on player interaction and loot distribution. The standard loot distribution method of Need Before Greed has been altered for the Raid Finder to be more restrictive on what loot is appropriate to which players, and as a result, it leaves little room for loot disputes.

If you are unfamiliar with our current stance, be aware that customer support does not intervene with loot disputes. This means that the rightful winner of a piece of gear in a Raid Finder group is the one who is sent the item by the distribution system. To maintain a level of fairness and equality in these matters, customer support will be unable to redistribute loot either as a result of a dispute or at the request of a player who wishes to swap the item to another. As the two-hour trade timer will still be applicable in these situations, players can swap items between themselves should they decide to do so.

Fangs of the Father
Rogues will be provided with an opportunity to pursue some of the most legendary weaponry designed to date. The Fangs of the Father quest line will be an arduous journey for even the most seasoned adventurer.
In line with our previous policies regarding Legendary weapons, we want players to understand the weight of their decisions when pursuing them. As a result, customer support will be unable to assist in most situations involving the Fangs of the Father quest line. While all cases are taken on an individual basis, refunds, exchanges, or the trading of related items will largely be outside the scope of what our policies allow. Tread carefully, heroes!

The Darkmoon Faire
The Darkmoon Faire is changing in many ways and will vastly differ from what you may have previously experienced. New items, prizes, and games await the curious and bold, and we encourage our players to participate in every facet, from quests to the new Deathmatch Arena.

However, as any of the carnival folk will tell you, it’s every man for himself out there. Quest items acquired from dungeons are Bind-on-Pickup, and once the quest has been accepted, the item will no longer be able to be traded. Customer support will not intervene in swapping these items, as the two-hour trade timer is applicable prior to the quest being accepted. In addition, participants of the Deathmatch Arena should be aware that once begun, sanctuary from your opponents will not be granted. Players should be wary of entering the Arena unless they are prepared to duke it out to the death!

Guild Leadership
With the introduction of patch 4.3, guilds will have more control over their leadership in cases where the leader goes MIA. After 30 days have passed, guild leadership will be able to be passed to a high-ranking and active individual to help continue cultivating a guild’s progression.

With the introduction of this feature, customer support will no longer intervene in guild leadership disputes. The matters of leadership and guild organization are meant for the guild to discuss and arrange, and we want to stress that leadership decisions should be made after thoughtful contemplation for and by those involved.
