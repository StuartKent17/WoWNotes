Warlords of Draenor Developer Interviews<br>

eSports<br>
<br>
Blizzard is always looking to make WoW a better esport.<br>
Right now the team mostly focuses on 3v3 arenas, but they want to hear what the community wants in regards to eSports, in PvP or otherwise. <br>
Arenas are a big part of what makes WoW an eSport, but there may be other parts of WoW that players would also be interested in. For example, some players enjoy the Live Raid at Blizzcon.<br>
Other partners have reached out to Blizzard to see what tools they are putting in place to support eSports, including MLG (https://twitter.com/MrAdamAp/status/444196493956632576).<br>
PvP can be hard to watch, especially with TDM being much faster in other games. In WoW, it can take 15 minutes for someone to die or something exciting to happen, which is a long time for someone watching that isn&apos;t very familiar with the game. This can be partially mitigated by casters keeping viewers informed with what is going on and why.<br>
The game has to be fun to play before it can be fun to watch. The next step is having tools that make it easier to watch, such as spectator mode.<br>
The devs are looking at the smaller things they can do to grow the WoW eSports community.<br>
<br>
<br>
Spectator Mode<br>
<br>
Being able to set the time before Dampening activates in Spectator Mode games isn&apos;t planned right now, as having inconsistent rules would make arenas harder to watch.<br>
The addition of spectator mode (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3774-Warlords-of-Draenor-Trial-of-the-Gladiator-Gone-Skirmishes-and-Spectator-Mode) for Warlords of Draenor arenas being one example of something the community has been requesting for a long time that is finally being added.<br>
<br>
<br>
PvP in Warlords of Draenor<br>
<br>
If the team makes a balance change, players get upset about the changes that were made. If they don&apos;t make any balance changes, people complain that the game is starting to feel stale. <br>
The team has been trying to increase the participation in PvP, without hurting the game that people already doing PvP love. <br>
The way that CC and DR works is hidden to many players, but it is also one of the important parts of competitive PvP. The team would like to make them less complex, as complexity is good when it adds depth, but not good when complexity exists for no reason. <br>
The PvP game is going to feel very new and different in Warlords of Draenor, almost starting from scratch with balance. This time around the team will spend a lot of time on iterating on things and collecting feedback from top players that give useful feedback. <br>
<br>
<br>
Holinka<br>
<br>
Holinka does rated battlegrounds and arenas most days of the week, as well as some arenas at lunch almost every day. <br>
He also plays other games as time permits, such as Titanfall and Stick of Truth. There are lessons to be learned from playing other games.<br>
He had 6 characters and 8 specs that he played last season, so he understands the effort it takes to cap on alts. <br>

quick question. why cant i use death&apos;s advande when using the glyphed version of pillar of frost...?<br>
20 seconds of CC immunity with no downside is too good. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/440978198050770944))<br>
<br>
Need way to dump RP to AE. Feels like this has always been missing. Most common request for 5.0 and now 6.0.<br>
Sindragosa&apos;s Breath. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441650526782885888))<br>
Indeed, but cd means it cannot be used to dump RP, and talent means not universal. Many DKs will cont to FrostStrike/DCoil in AE<br>
That&apos;s fine. The whole row helps with AoE. Doesn&apos;t have to be an RP spender. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441651165042716672))<br>
<br>
I mean, to a pt that a talent can chng your gameplay ? Bcause with what we can read now, i don&apos;t think so and it makes me sad <br>
Yeah, some of the lvl100 talents are pretty significant changes. Necrotic Plague for Unholy = the Festerblight rotation. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441531538916638721))<br>
Sindragosa&apos;s Breath also changes your rotation quite significantly, primarily for the DPS DKs. Makes you want to pool... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441531729547771905))<br>
...RP as it&apos;s coming off cooldown, and generate/dump RM as much as you can while it&apos;s up, to keep it going as long as poss. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441532041041936384))<br>
I feel like it would have to proc rune talents for that to be effective<br>
It does. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441539756506492928))<br>
is conversion going to proc them also?<br>
We&apos;re thinking about that one still. Possibly. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441722989285892096))<br>

yall nerfing gaurdian druids in PvP or nahh?<br>
You are the first person to ever complain to me about Guardian Druids in PvP (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/441306991244214273))<br>
really? Theyre incredible good flagcarriers<br>
There&apos;s nothing wrong with a class being good at something. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/441328985457192960))<br>
<br>
The balance druid eclipse mechanic is very clunky, can we do something with it in WoD. Like remove it?<br>
Eclipse is the defining mechanic of Moonkin. Virtually zero chance that we&apos;d remove it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441373003998179328))<br>
<br>
Can you tell us if Equinox for balance druids has changed? It sounded too powerful to be true, or Eclipse is lower to fit it in.<br>
Equinox is still in, yep. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442169798344982528))<br>
<br>
Will there be an glyph for old efflorescence though? The on-demand placeable AoE heal far more valuable in WoD healing model!<br>
Not planning to. Moving your Shroom is still on-demand placeable AoE healing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442241514194735104))<br>

arcane IS very boring to play and it DOES suffer from movement the MOST. arcane mobility v warlocks\hunters not fair.<br>
Arcane is intentionally very movement inhibited. That&apos;s one of its downsides. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/440448091267678209))<br>

Has it been a couple weeks yet? Let&apos;s Take A Jab At It has dropped! More WW, MW soon(tm). with http://t.co/D84wRW8Bo1<br>
I think you guys are imagining some huge &quot;us vs the developers&quot; thing that we don&apos;t even see as there. There seems to be this misconception that we are saying &quot;You guys are doing it all wrong, and could be doing WAY more damage!&quot; or something. Saying that we are telling you avoid haste like the plague is just strawmanning. I think this all started when there was some really silly bad theorycraft going around in like 5.1 or 5.2 that said to take Ascension, max max MAX haste, and don&apos;t use FoF or EB at all. That was quite wrong, and we pointed out, then words have been put in our mouth since then. Result is, haste/crit/mastery are all really close, and we&apos;ve seen top performance with each, as long as you don&apos;t energy cap, and make good use of FoF/EB.Future of FoF: If +30% dmg will make you satisfied... you&apos;ll be elated. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442221616013918208))<br>
.Do you think the lack of lots of other high secondary stats stems from lack of wanting to try them? Or follow the leader?<br>
Following the leader is an incredibly strong effect in our community. Not sure what you&apos;re referring to exactly here though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442241063739072512))<br>
<br>
Why is orb spam being removed not mentioned. Its the only burst heal instant monk got not tied to big cds<br>
...except for Surging Mist, right? Remember that retuning is happening. Surging is lackluster in 5.4, won&apos;t be in 6.0. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442255202440056832))<br>
<br>
Are fistweavers and windwalkers (or melee in general?) supposed to attract desecrated weapon on garrosh?<br>
It&apos;s distance-based, not spec-based. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/442807274528964608))<br>
