A. All low and some medium population realms will be connected. They’ll all have a healthy population when we’re done.

A. We'll try to keep you posted on the latest schedules as we get them.

Q. My realm has a lower population than those on the list, why isn’t mine being connected first?
A. The order we connect realms depends on a number of technical factors, but we will get to them all.

FAQ

Q. My realm needs connecting, why isn’t it listed?
A. The connections listed are the phases we’ve currently finalized and have planned connection dates or estimates available for. Additional connections are possible, but they just haven’t reached that stage yet. We’ll be updating the realm connection list as phases complete and new phases are planned.

Q. When will my realm be connected?
A. We'll update this thread with the latest information on currently planned phases.

Q. My realm has a lower population than those on the list, why isn’t mine being connected first?
A. Realm connections are based on a number of factors including population, faction balance, the realm’s physical location in the world compared to other realms it may be connected to, among others. It’s also worth noting that websites which attempt to track population, while helpful in many ways, are estimates based on public data which may not provide the clearest picture of actual population.

Warlords of Draenor Stats
With Crit being on gear much more often in WOD are there any plans for making Crit better for Elemental with no reforging?
A Where did you get that Crit will be on gear much more often? B We're considering some changes, but nothing to announce yet. Source 

Will tertiary stats appear on PvP gear in WoD? Sockets etc. are supposed to appear randomly, though, so...
We're talking about it still. If PvP gear doesn't have it, then PvE gear becomes better by default. Source 
Wish we could chose our tertiary stats on PvP gear, kinda like reforging but for 100% value...
Keep in mind that tertiary stats are intended to be very rare. So, whatever the PvP design, the rarity would match PvE. Source 

What about removing Spirit and let Haste be the main factor of mana regen? Throwing ideas around. @Celestalon
Spirit's value varies significantly between classes. One contributor is what the other secondaries do for regen. Source 
We're looking at potential changes in that regard, to standardize that better between classes. Source 

What will you do with hit, exp etc in 6.0? Convert to other stats or just remove them?
Convert them to other stats. Source 
What about Spirit? On clothes? On Jewelry? Some DPS casters are using them on rings/neck at least.
No spirit on armor may involve increasing the amount of spirit on non-armor. That makes it more complex to change existing armor. We recognize the problem and are planning potential solutions, but aren't ready to give specifics yet. Source 
Wouldn't increasing the amount of regen spirit gives instead avoid that issue?
That may be part of it, but we may change how we itemize non-armor pieces. Just complicates the issue. Source 
If healers have enough regen with 1-2 spirit pieces in first raid tier, what happens to mana regen later on?
"Enough" is a very ethereal concept. It also varies with other gear. And definitely not from 1-2 items in the first tier. Source 
Then between 3 and 6 of 7 slots. If item stats triple again, will only need max 2 spirit pieces in final tier. Also, sockets.
Sounds like you're ignoring the fact that "enough" changes between tiers. Source 

Warlords of Draenor PvE
... or the difference between LFR/normal/hc/mythic could also be a tad lower, like 10 itemlevels instead of the current 13.
A larger gap between tiers allows us to have bosses that test performance more. It also makes upgrades "feel" noticeable. Source 

you know how battle rez will work in normal/heroic? 3 regardless of size like current flex?
We're investigating some possible solutions. We want to make it scale by size, but know that breakpoints are not the answer. It ... Source 
... may be an opportunity to solve some other problems with the system, like # available being hidden, and the # being the same ... Source 
... on short vs long fights. We don't have details to share yet, but those are concerns we're thinking about. May not fix all those Source 

PvP
Why not go GW2 sPvP style? They made it all skill based and still rewarding. Cooler looking gear as you progress.
The Trial of the Gladiator is our plan for a "gearless" PvP ecosystem. 0% chance we're removing gear in PvP overall. Source 

Any chance PvP trinket will have a unique sound in the near future?
Excellent idea. Thanks for pointing it out. Source 
Definitely a great idea!
Well, the proper authorities have been notified! Source 

ok death grip bugs on tolviron and shado pan for over a year now 100% chance when target is next to a wall. Why are you ignoring it
We'll have to follow up on it. It requires geometry and collision work. We've discussed it before. Source 

Please encourage pvp participation in random bgs with CP, 100 when you win and 50 when you lose. I hate Arenas and Rbgs.
I could see doing something similar to what we do in RBGs base on final score. Would have to give it more thought. Source 

winning one awarded 5,6 or 7, losing takes you 14
Aware of MMR issues. We've been doing some work on the system but it isn't appropriate to roll it out mid season. Source
