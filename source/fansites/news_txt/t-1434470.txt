FAQ

A. We'll try to keep you posted on the latest schedules as we get them.

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/us-en.png US Connected Realms Update 1/6
Don't miss reading the EU FAQ! "All low and some medium population realms will be connected."

FAQ

Q. My realm needs connecting, why isn’t it listed?
A. The connections listed are the phases we’ve currently finalized and have planned connection dates or estimates available for. Additional connections are possible, but they just haven’t reached that stage yet. We’ll be updating the realm connection list as phases complete and new phases are planned.

Q. When will my realm be connected?
A. We'll update this thread with the latest information on currently planned phases.

Q. My realm has a lower population than those on the list, why isn’t mine being connected first?
A. Realm connections are based on a number of factors including population, faction balance, the realm’s physical location in the world compared to other realms it may be connected to, among others. It’s also worth noting that websites which attempt to track population, while helpful in many ways, are estimates based on public data which may not provide the clearest picture of actual population.

Warlords of Draenor Stats
With Crit being on gear much more often in WOD are there any plans for making Crit better for Elemental with no reforging?
A Where did you get that Crit will be on gear much more often? B We're considering some changes, but nothing to announce yet. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408789920098971648

Will tertiary stats appear on PvP gear in WoD? Sockets etc. are supposed to appear randomly, though, so...
We're talking about it still. If PvP gear doesn't have it, then PvE gear becomes better by default. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/410518050819936257
Wish we could chose our tertiary stats on PvP gear, kinda like reforging but for 100% value...
Keep in mind that tertiary stats are intended to be very rare. So, whatever the PvP design, the rarity would match PvE. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/410566262138208256

What about removing Spirit and let Haste be the main factor of mana regen? Throwing ideas around. @Celestalon
Spirit's value varies significantly between classes. One contributor is what the other secondaries do for regen. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409907822252412928
We're looking at potential changes in that regard, to standardize that better between classes. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409907928208916480

What will you do with hit, exp etc in 6.0? Convert to other stats or just remove them?
Convert them to other stats. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/415959639373524992
What about Spirit? On clothes? On Jewelry? Some DPS casters are using them on rings/neck at least.
No spirit on armor may involve increasing the amount of spirit on non-armor. That makes it more complex to change existing armor. We recognize the problem and are planning potential solutions, but aren't ready to give specifics yet. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416680961342857216
Wouldn't increasing the amount of regen spirit gives instead avoid that issue?
That may be part of it, but we may change how we itemize non-armor pieces. Just complicates the issue. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416698025877065728
If healers have enough regen with 1-2 spirit pieces in first raid tier, what happens to mana regen later on?
"Enough" is a very ethereal concept. It also varies with other gear. And definitely not from 1-2 items in the first tier. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416860892853047297
Then between 3 and 6 of 7 slots. If item stats triple again, will only need max 2 spirit pieces in final tier. Also, sockets.
Sounds like you're ignoring the fact that "enough" changes between tiers. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417078989790789633

Warlords of Draenor PvE
... or the difference between LFR/normal/hc/mythic could also be a tad lower, like 10 itemlevels instead of the current 13.
A larger gap between tiers allows us to have bosses that test performance more. It also makes upgrades "feel" noticeable. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410886682435543040

you know how battle rez will work in normal/heroic? 3 regardless of size like current flex?
We're investigating some possible solutions. We want to make it scale by size, but know that breakpoints are not the answer. It ... Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416689659150741504
... may be an opportunity to solve some other problems with the system, like # available being hidden, and the # being the same ... Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416690207019110400
... on short vs long fights. We don't have details to share yet, but those are concerns we're thinking about. May not fix all those Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416690586876268545

PvP
Why not go GW2 sPvP style? They made it all skill based and still rewarding. Cooler looking gear as you progress.
The Trial of the Gladiator is our plan for a "gearless" PvP ecosystem. 0% chance we're removing gear in PvP overall. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417394936510574592

Any chance PvP trinket will have a unique sound in the near future?
Excellent idea. Thanks for pointing it out. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417150092844339201
Definitely a great idea!
Well, the proper authorities have been notified! Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417241995300466688

ok death grip bugs on tolviron and shado pan for over a year now 100% chance when target is next to a wall. Why are you ignoring it
We'll have to follow up on it. It requires geometry and collision work. We've discussed it before. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417154026115854338

Please encourage pvp participation in random bgs with CP, 100 when you win and 50 when you lose. I hate Arenas and Rbgs.
I could see doing something similar to what we do in RBGs base on final score. Would have to give it more thought. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417153763955077123

winning one awarded 5,6 or 7, losing takes you 14
Aware of MMR issues. We've been doing some work on the system but it isn't appropriate to roll it out mid season. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/416583868276551680
