Garrison Campaign Quests
Thanks for the tip! If anyone else has found they haven't been able to progress their Garrison Campaign storyline from week to week, or don't believe they ever started one, please provide more info and we can try to help. Checking the campaign locations may reveal an unknowingly skipped step as these campaign chapters also include an "Assault" bar, they can sometimes be mistaken as only being an Assault on the location.

Wait there garrison campaigns? How i miss that and whee you start at? I hear about invasion and figure i did something wrong. But it seem so trivial and now i want to try.
It's a weekly campaign that unlocks over time and is intended to continue throughout future updates, not too dissimilar to the 5.1: Landfall content, but this is a bigger and more sweeping story that send you out to the various level 100 areas across Draenor. The first 8 weeks offer quests somewhat randomly, and then the four after those are a set story progression, to be continued in future patch releases. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 


Patch 6.1 - Garrison Jukebox Music
The initial Patch 6.1 build added a few songs with items Legends of Azeroth , The Burning Legion , Wrath of the Lich King , but the quests reveal other songs that likely will be available for your jukebox. There is no indication on how these will be unlocked yet.
