Profession Leveling in Battle for Azeroth
In Battle for Azeroth, some major changes are coming to the way we level professions. 


Each profession will now be separated into expansions and leveled separately from one another. 
Each expansion will have it's own leveling path for items from that expansion, similar to the Mists of Pandaria cooking ways. 
You can choose to go back and level older expansion crafting, or you can simply level the current expansion. 
This allows you to craft items with current expansion materials without needing older expansion materials to level
You can still go back and level older expansion crafting skills as well. 
To clarify further, an example of this means that you can level your "Cataclysm Tailoring" by crafting Cataclysm patterns, but this doesn't stop you from progressing your "Kul Tiran / Zandalari Tailoring" from with the new expansion's patterns.
First Aid is going away  and its patterns are being redistributed into Tailoring and Alchemy. Your First Aid crafts will have to be relearned in their respective new profession.


In BfA will we have to relearn crafts from previous expansions?
In Battle for Azeroth, any crafts youâ€™ve learned in the past will still be there and not need to be re-learned, with the exception of First Aid. Tailoring and Alchemy crafts, bandages, and anti-venoms that used to be in First Aid will have to be re-learned.WarcraftDevs

Season 6 Elite Ensembles
I even dare assume a lot of people from this thread would be pretty pissed if they don't release it by next week or so

I have faith that since they promised it will get it done either this week or next week but we will see.

This is kinda why we don't like to promise or say when to expect something like this. :/ Its easy to assume that, but this would be most likely be separate from the usual end of season rewards. Just to set the proper expectation I wouldn't expect this in the next week or two. 

If something does change though I will update you guys Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
