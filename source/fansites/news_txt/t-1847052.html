Blizzcon Digital Bonuses Code<br>
The Digital Bonuses Codes went out to Blizzcon ticket holders today. These codes give you a Virtual Ticket, access to In-Game goodies, and the online sale. So far, we know that Murkidan (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/10322-murkidan) will be one of the in-game (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/85009-dwarf-gronnling) rewards. <br>

No word on what will be in it this year, but you can get an idea by looking at last year&apos;s bag (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4474-Blizzcon-2014-Day-0-Goody-Bag).<br>

Mounts<br>
That moose mount is great. Please say it can fly. Always wanted a flying moose.<br>

PvP<br>
Another reminder that I make no announcements &amp; answer no questions about WoW on twitter. Be wary of malicious fake accounts trolling you. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/631950750050988032))<br>
<br>
been doing alot of BGs lately and I gotta say Horde has majorly bought into a defeatist &quot;groupthink&quot;. They don&apos;t even try anymore.<br>
The groupthink problem is a tremendous challenge (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/631631845101211648))<br>

<br>
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Classes<br>
specifically ret I was getting tuned constantly why did it need such an overhaul? What was the mindset there?D<br>
Low skill ceiling. There wasn&apos;t a way to really get better by playing more, which was always going to keep their dps down. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/623133763233447936))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
everyone thinks sun well wasn&apos;t planned and was a band-aid. Can you confirm it was part of the original BC plans or not?<br>
I think it was added when LK ended up taking longer. I may be wrong. I don&apos;t trust my memory on that. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/626544972137762816))<br>
