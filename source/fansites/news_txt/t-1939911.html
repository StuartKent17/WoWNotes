Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
I think the MMOC forums have come full circle by saying is a genius https://t.co/TrXy3xDkTP<br>
It waxes and wanes with the moon. Legendaries are hard to design though. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689149714143428609))<br>
<br>
I wish people would stop bringing up on the forums...he doesn&apos;t work on WOW anymore, you idiots - he&apos;s not &quot;ruining&quot; you<br>
The clever way some posters found to still blame me is the damage I did is so severe, it is taking multiple expansions to fix! (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689186785197342720))<br>
<br>
what do you think about blizz response about classic realms? I think if enough people want it they should dedicate the resources.<br>
My guess is they are a novelty that will seem awesome for two weeks and suffer from falling interest in two months. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689149996478803969))<br>
Given that, if it was easy to turn them on, it would make sense, but it&apos;s far from easy. Those servers don&apos;t exist anymore. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689150161151365120))<br>
