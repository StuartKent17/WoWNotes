Tier 20 armor sets are here! They may look familiar, as many of them are inspired by the Tier 6 armor sets.

Keep in mind that this is an early preview. Sets may be unfinished, missing pieces, and missing colors.

Take a look at them in the modelviewer for the full picture, especially Mythic Druid and Warlocks use the Jump Start animation.
