Boubouille2009-08-31, 11:43 AMPatch 3.2.2 Companion Pets
The latest PTR patch added a few companion pets to the game and it seems that I forgot to post screenshots for a few of them. Sadly, we don't have the drop locations for most of them and we'll have to discover that later on live servers. 

Update - Fixed a stupid error, let's pretend that we didn't see it. 

Spectral Tiger Cub  will be a reward of the upcoming Trading Card expansion "Scourgewar". 
Onyxia Whelpling  will be given away to anyone in game during the 5th anniversary of World of Warcraft.
Pandaren Monk  drop location is unknown but we might have a hint before the end of the PTRs. 
Lil' KT  drop location is unknown.
Zipao Tiger  drop location is unknown. 
Wind Rider Cub  drop location is unknown. Please note that the model is not textured for the moment
Gryphon Hatchling  drop location is unknown. 

I'll count all the "Aaaawww .... Cute!" comments in this news at the end of the day.
