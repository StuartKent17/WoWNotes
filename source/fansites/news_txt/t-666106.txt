Boubouille2009-08-31, 11:43 AMPatch 3.2.2 Companion Pets
The latest PTR patch added a few companion pets to the game and it seems that I forgot to post screenshots for a few of them. Sadly, we don't have the drop locations for most of them and we'll have to discover that later on live servers. 

Update - Fixed a stupid error, let's pretend that we didn't see it. 

Spectral Tiger Cub http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49343/spectral-tiger-cub/ will be a reward of the upcoming Trading Card expansion "Scourgewar". 
Onyxia Whelpling http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69002/onyxian-whelpling/ will be given away to anyone in game during the 5th anniversary of World of Warcraft.
Pandaren Monk http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69541/pandaren-monk/ drop location is unknown but we might have a hint before the end of the PTRs. 
Lil' KT http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69677/lil-k-t/ drop location is unknown.
Zipao Tiger http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69539/zipao-tiger/ drop location is unknown. 
Wind Rider Cub http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69536/wind-rider-cub/ drop location is unknown. Please note that the model is not textured for the moment
Gryphon Hatchling http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69535/gryphon-hatchling/ drop location is unknown. 

I'll count all the "Aaaawww .... Cute!" comments in this news at the end of the day.
