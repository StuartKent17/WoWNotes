Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Over catering to the "casual" is the reason for guild and friendship drops in WoW? From 1 - LFR = I don't socialize.
Server identity eroded over time, which can hurt social experiences, but that started with transfers and faster leveling. OccupyGStreet

Blizzard announced Rexxar will be released tomorrow! They also announced  reporting changes, a silence penalty, and some other new information. 

Going forward, you will be able to report players for Abusive Chat, Feeding, being AFK, Cheating, Inappropriate Names, and Spam. Players that are reported for Spam or Abusive Chat will be investigated and then silenced for 24 hours. The silence duration will double each time after that, with no cap.
