Boubouille2008-01-09, 09:23 AMThe 2.3.2 patch is now deployed on both US and EU realms, however the huge amount of bug reports concerning the patch probably means we'll get a 2.3.3 patch after all. It was only mentioned once until now

It's still unsure on how it will affect 2.4 testing but it wouldn't be surprising if it wasn't deployed on PTR this week after all, actually the post announcing the PTRs back online on January 10th has been edited and changed to "will not come back up until next phase" and it probably doesn't mean anything good for us. 
In order to perform maintenance, all PTRs will be taken down on January 7th at 18:00 Paris time CET. This will conclude the 2.3.2 PTR phase and the realms will not come back up until the next testing phase. 

The Blizzard podcast is still scheduled for release tomorrow if everything goes well. Nothing confirmed officialy and publicly yet

AV hotfix - Balinda and Vanndar health increased
Another tweak to try to balance the situation in Alterac Valley. This is a hotfix and you should notice the change immediatly. 
Weâ€™ve recently applied a hotfix that increases the hitpoints for both Balinda Stonehearth and Vanndar Stormpike in Alterac Valley. This change is being made to help assist in balancing the opposing sides and their ability to compete in the battleground.

We will continue to track the balance of the battleground and the factions as they fight for supremacy in Alterac Valley, and continue to make further changes as needed.


Alchemy - Transmutation mastery fixed
That's a pretty good news for all the alchemists out there, time to make tons of money again. 
Transmute mastery has been fully fixed in 2.3.2 This was a change that didn't make it into the patch notes.


Armory performance issues
They fixed parts of the armory but it seems it's still not enough, Blizzard is still working on it to get it fixed as soon as possible.
We are aware that some players may be experiencing some performance issues with the Armory; due to the popularity of the Armory, it is susceptible to high amounts of traffic which can result in slow load times. These slow load times can adversely affect armory performance, cause character data to not refresh properly, result in browser issues, or cause the page to stop responding entirely. We are actively working on addressing these issues and will provide updates as soon as they are available.


Mages - Icy Veins tooltip
Mages, be careful if you plan to respec after the patch, the tooltip is a bit misleading and you might want to read this post first.
The tooltip for Icy Veins is a bit misleading, it provides 20% haste not 20% cast reduction. 20% haste as Duman explains provides less than 20% cast reduction. The ability is working correctly and the tooltip is going to be updated in a future patch.
