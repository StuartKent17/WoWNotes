chaud2011-12-24, 07:22 AMMMO-Champion "Be nice, not naughty!" Giveaway
It's almost Christmas! All the WoW players around the world are happy and busy being nice to everyone they know and don't know in-game! ... Ok, most of you aren't that nice and I heard that Santa's "naughty" list is getting longer and longer with so many people gearing up in LFR. : 

That's why Christmas and the holidays is a wonderful time to change that behavior, especially if you can get free stuff just by being nice! And just like last year, we'll do our best to convince you to be extra nice, and love bunnies.

A lot of these items were kindly offered by WoWTCGLoot.com http://www.wowtcgloot.com/, thanks to them!

Giveaway Rules
This giveaway is very simple and will require you to do a few easy things. 

1. Join a random instance or raid group through the /lfd or /lfr tool, and when you arrive in the instance you have to:

Say hello to the members of the group.
Wish them Happy Holidays/a Merry Christmas! 
Ask them "Bunnies are really great, don't you think?"


2. You have to at least kill a boss with that same group, I'm expecting you to kill the last boss and finish the instance instead of quitting after the first wipe. Let's say that two members in LFD and ten in LFR are allowed to change over the course of the instance because you can't control other people ragequitting over stupid things but it won't happen if you're nice!

At the end of the instance or whenever you decide to leave:

Say goodbye to the members of the group and thanks them for their time. 
Wish them Happy Holidays/a Merry Christmas again!


3. Post on the MMO-Champion "Be nice, not naughty!" Giveaway - Screenshots Thread http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1050506-MMO-Champion-quot-Be-nice-not-naughty!-quot-Giveaway-Screenshots?p=14785567#post14785567 the two screenshots of 1. and 2. to show the world how nice you are. After you're done with that, you will officially be on the list of the people nice enough to be picked for free stuff! 

4. Winners will be picked on December 30th at 08:00PM GMT based on their post numbers. If there are 2437 replies at the end of the giveaway, I will do a /random 1-2437 either in-game or on a random number generator site and will select winners based on their post number!

5. Please don't enter more than once, as that isn't nice. Naughty people don't get presents!

6. Please use Imgur.com http://imgur.com/ to host your images so that they will be around for us to look at if you win.
