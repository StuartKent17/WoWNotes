<br>
We are currently prepping PTR for release to the public. We estimate that it will be available after 6PM Pacific time.<br>
<br>
Until that time please delete the wowtest folder from within your World of Warcraft directory. Do not attempt to copy characters and do not attempt to download the client.<br>
<br>
Patch notes will be posted shortly.<br>
<br>
There is a known bug in the build being put on the PTR today with Arena Matches.<br>
<br>
Sometimes when starting an Arena match not all characters will receive the Arena Preparation buff and the match will not start.<br>
<br>
We are working to resolve this issue and it will be fixed in a future PTR patch.<br>
<br>
Oh and also.<br>
<br>
I know everyone is going to ask these things so I&apos;m going to post this once. New posts about these topics will be deleted.<br>
<br>
There are No Pre-mades for 2.3<br>
<br>
All previous PTR characters were wiped.<br>
<br>
There are no equipment vendors (McWeaksauce Brothers) on the 2.3 PTR<br>
<br>
There will only be TWO PTR servers, no PVP II<br>
<br>
The PTR Authentication server was updated on Monday October 8th. If your account was not valid prior to the authentication update you will not be able to participate in the 2.3.x PTR phase. If your password was changed after October 8th then you may be able to use your old password on the PTR.<br>
<br>
The new Guild Banks feature is currently turned off on the PTR, it will be activated later.</div></div>
