PTR Build Deploy 2/14/2017
Greetings all,

PTR realms have begun to spin down in order to deploy a new 7.2.0 build this afternoon. No ETA for today's push but I'll ping this thread if things look like they're going to take longer than usual ~4-6 hours.

I'll leave this thread open for discussion so long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines. 

Thanks everyone!
