Now that BFA Season 1 is underway, we&#x2019;ve seen a number of questions about the item levels of various rewards and reward tiers. Here&#x2019;s an outline of the current item levels you&#x2019;ll see when you receive rewards from ranked PvP:<br>
<br>
<br>
Tier, Rating, End of Match iLvl, Weekly cache iLvl, Weekly Azerite item iLvl <br>
Unranked, 0 &#x2013; 1399, item level 340, item level 355, item level 355 <br>
Combatant, 1400 &#x2013; 1599, item level 350, item level 365, item level 355 <br>
Challenger, 1600 &#x2013; 1799, item level 360, item level 370, item level 370 <br>
Rival, 1800 &#x2013; 2099, item level 365, item level 375, item level 370 <br>
Duelist, 2100 &#x2013; 2399, item level 370, item level 380, item level 385 <br>
Gladiator, 2400+, item level 375, item level 385, item level 385 <br>
<br>
Some reminders:<br>
End of match rewards are occasional.<br>
For your weekly Azerite item Conquest turn-in, see Marshal Gabriel in the Salt and Shanty Inn near the Ashvane Docks in Boralus or Xander Silberman at Mugambala in Zandalar.<br>
You&#x2019;ll loot your weekly cache reward from a chest in that area.<br>
The weekly cache items can Warforge/Titanforge.<br>
<br>
Now go strike down your enemies!<br>
<br>
Does this mean there are two separate weekly rewards? One from conquest turn in and one from a chest? Still confused with this system, it needs further explaining.<br>
<br>
There is two things yes. The End of Match reward and the Weekly Cache. The Cache is a chest at the two PvP hubs, which can reward Azerite items or non-Azerite items. Since Azerite items are set item levels that cannot Warforge or Titanforge that&apos;s why their item levels are listed out.<br>
<br>
The table we made is a little misleading as we tried to format it as best as we could on these forums. The weekly reward and the Azerite are the same thing, if the weekly chest contained an Azerite piece that&apos;s the ilvl it would be.<br>
<br>
Hey just wondering is it intended for pvp conquest cap reward to be 280? Seems a little weird that it rewards gear lower then world quests by quite a bit. Thanks.<br>
Conquest rewards for the first week of the new PvP Season are an item level 345 weapon of your choice from class options. We&apos;re working on a fix to display the correct item level. (Source (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1037408409396568065))<br>
<br>
We can change weapons? Appears to just be an ele weapon.<br>
Once you reach 500 Conquest, you&apos;ll be given a quest to return to The Mugambala or Hook Point that lets you choose your weapon. The one displayed in the UI is just an example of one option. (Source (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1037413116806488064))<br>

Just want to clear this up cause got quite a few psts cause i was the closest to 2100, i can confirm that there is no new enchant at 2100 boys i already have all 3 of the other enchants so i cannot tell you which ones it gives when you hit duelist<br>
We&apos;re actually going to be adding an Elite Enchant for 2100 (Duelist) soon on a vendor within Hook Point/Mugambala soon. Sorry for the delay on that. (Source (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1100863-no-new-enchant-at-2100/))<br>
