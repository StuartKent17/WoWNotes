Face Queen Azshara&#x2019;s most devoted champions in an epic new raid&#x2014;The Eternal Palace.<br>
<br>
Ten thousand years ago, as the seas engulfed Zin-Azshari, Queen Azshara forged a dark bargain with N&#x2019;Zoth that transformed her loyal subjects into the sinister naga. Through millennia of brutal conquest, Azshara has built a new empire from the ruins of the old and now holds dominion over the depths that once threatened to claim her. Ever the gracious host, she has invited the Alliance and Horde alike into her eternal palace to witness her glorious ascension&#x2026; and their ultimate demise.<br>
