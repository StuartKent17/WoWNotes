Armory Stats - Heroic Siege of Orgrimmar Class Representation<br>
Today we are taking a look at class representation for characters that have killed a Heroic Siege of Orgrimmar boss at least once. There is no date restriction this time, so the sample comes from ~8.8 million characters and ~3.2 million accounts. Keep in mind that the sample size for Heroic Garrosh is less than 10,000 characters, so it is going to vary more than the larger samples. <br>
<br>
We looked at the same kind of thing back in Catacylsm for Heroic Madness of Deathwing (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2629-Patch-4-3-2-Release-Date-Update-Heroic-Madness-Class-Stats-Blue-Posts) if you are interested in seeing how things changed.<br>
<br>
When there is time, we can also look a this data by item level, Normal Siege of Orgrimmar kills, or several other factors. You can leave suggestions for future stat posts in the comments!<br>

hardest thing I do as a RL is helping healers know theyre doing a good job / how to improve. New tool to help eval in #warlords?<br>
We agree that healer performance is difficult to evaluate. Do you have any suggestions for what would help? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/421154918930464768))<br>
<br>
The data! Malk: http://t.co/G4iPvoEKZG, Jugg: http://t.co/XLpkWwuQfv, Sha: http://t.co/rkYaZz8veE, Thok: http://t.co/MJFtXssXlR<br>
Compare All Parses to Top 100. Shadow is deceptively hard to play optimally. Single target is low average, but high potential. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/421732036756271104))<br>
You must have some very hidden numbers, hunters were beating Spriest on many fights before 6%? buff ask most raiders 1/2<br>
We balance around more than just single target DPS. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/421782296446775296))<br>
I think that&apos;s the summary of this conversation. Many Shadow priests value ST damage above all else. Considering changes for WoD. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/421784335251804161))<br>
That&apos;s just preposterous. Shadow playing perfection with miraculous RNG does not have the potencial of mage/lock<br>
I agree. That&apos;s an Arcane/Warlock problem. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/421778578544414720))<br>
No it&apos;s not. It&apos;s a rogue/hunter/mage/warlock/shaman/druid problem. Shadow is simply not playable on e.g. H malkorok.<br>
And we disagree. Your damage is lower than average, but not crippling so, and your utility is higher on that fight. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/421779993673211904))<br>
Not the case for any other spec. They all have good and bad fights, sure, but shadow has 2 good, 10 bad and 2 unplayable ones.<br>
Total hyperbole. They have 3 great, 2 bad, 9 average, damage-wise. Most of those they have very high utility. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/421781046800052224))<br>
<br>
So the solution for Spriest single target is to remove dots from single target...but thats why I play Spriest, to use dots.<br>
The talent you&apos;re referring to is not a &quot;solution for Spriest single target&quot;. It&apos;s an optional different rotation. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/421720337718325248))<br>
<br>
Hi, is there anything still happening with the ability bloat? A good thread on about this- http://t.co/VdfhFUHaKG<br>
Yes. We haven&apos;t given specifics, but we&apos;re definitely going to be making big strides in combating ability bloat. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/421045192884363264))<br>
Thanks. Big strides is what lots of specs need desperately. If you had to guess - before WoD or not?<br>
Not. That sort of thing requires significant change, which we save for expansions. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/421046125622087680))<br>
<br>
past comments have said that dps are balanced around that fact. Not sure about tanks.<br>
Str and Agi are balanced once Agi/Int no longer give crit. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/421044546034622466))<br>

could u please fix the deathgrip bug in tolvir and tigers peak finally which is in the game since the start of mop? please <br>

Quick question, are druids getting a new aquatic form model in WoD? YES or NO?<br>
MAYBE (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421514097323028481))<br>
<br>
Then why were Undead allowed to be hunters? That makes no sense at all.<br>
At least pick one w/o tons of in-game precedence! P.S. I once tried arguing for undead paladins because SIR ZELIEK. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421513720678723584))<br>

must Cloud Serpents shrink character models? Not sure if bug or intended. Would prefer if it didn&apos;t. Thanks for reading <br>
Intended. Last-minute solution to realizing they were even more absurdly huge than intended, w/no time to remake saddles. T_T (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421513089339490304))<br>

could we see faction specificity removed from random BG&apos;s as it has been for RBG? ie Horde vs Horde. Would this improve que times?<br>
It would but one of the high level fantasies of WoW is red versus blue. We&apos;re exploring a lot of options now. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421093593403510784))<br>
<br>
said new PvP season would last aroun 20-25 weeks. I&apos;d say, around that.<br>
I definitely did NOT say the new PvP season would last around 20-25 weeks. I&apos;d say that&apos;s the max length I&apos;d want it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420989396176101377))<br>
out of curiosity? What is min length of a pvp season that you want.<br>
Ha ha. This is a fun game of release date we&apos;re playing. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421029957528477696))<br>

To add some more detail to the DR category conversations, you won&apos;t see things like Silence, Stun, Fear or Mez combined into one category. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421719580810022912))<br>
Can you tell us what we might see? Am very excited for streamlining of DR categories<br>
I know everyone wants to know what we&apos;re doing, but I was mostly concerned with putting some fears to rest. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421720800224231425))<br>
Only hint: Despite his declaration we can&apos;t get it right isn&apos;t far off with what we&apos;re thinking. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421721186096017408))<br>
Also we hate the single DR idea. That will not happen. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421721411372085249))<br>

Necrotic strike and aura of enfeeble and arcane slow is nerfed without second thought<br>
They weren&apos;t nerfed by accident. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421765275474599937))<br>
sad about enfeeblement nerf. It&apos;s fundamentally different from passively applied effects. Should be treated differently.<br>
If it the argument is it&apos;s bad gameplay, I don&apos;t think warlocks should be exempt from the change. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421746574390079488))<br>
<br>
Warriors can use shield wall without equip shield. May we remove the physical punishment of Divine Shield and Hand of Protection?<br>
I don&apos;t normally like to compare specs but I hope you can see what a profound difference there is between those spells. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421448324231593984))<br>
