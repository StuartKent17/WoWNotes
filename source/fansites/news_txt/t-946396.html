<br>
You will probably see updates on MMO-Champion as soon as the NDA is lifted if anything really important is announced there (beta, end of the world, etc ...) and in any cases you will get a full report on Diablofans.com (http://diablofans.com/). <br>
<br>
Nothing new on the Patch 4.3 side yet, hopefully it will hit the test servers &quot;soon&quot; since Blizzard already mentioned in the past that they would release patches faster. <br>

Paragon VS Ragnaros 25man Heroic World First Kill Video<br>
DREAM Paragon (http://www.paragon.fi/) released their video of the Ragnaros world first kill yesterday and I didn&apos;t have the occasion to embed it. However, something weird happened during the encoding and the quality was lower than intended. Paragon reuploaded the video with that problem fixed, enjoy!<br>
