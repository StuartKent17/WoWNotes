&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/important.png&quot; title=&quot;Important&quot; /&gt; Overview - At the beginning of the encounter Garrosh calls Kor&apos;kron Warbringers and Far Seers to assault the players alongside him. Siege Engineers periodically join the battle and try to activate the Kor&apos;kron Iron Stars on the sides of the room. Killing a Siege Engineer will prevent him from activating his Iron Star, but an active Iron Star will also crush any Kor&apos;kron orcs in its path. When Garrosh reaches 10% health remaining, he will draw upon the power of Y&apos;Shaarj to heal himself, gaining new abilities and no longer calling orc soldiers to his aid. During this phase, Garrosh will periodically pull all players into the Realm of Y&apos;Shaarj, where they must battle their way through Sha minions to reach Garrosh and interrupt his efforts to draw more power from the heart. Every 25 energy Garrosh is allowed to gain will empower one of his abilities. Upon being reduced to 10% health a second time, Garrosh will fully drain the Heart of Y&apos;Shaarj, granting him 100 energy and empowering all his abilities until he is defeated.<br>

Heroic Nazgrim&apos;s Execute: Where encounter design fails class design (Guardian tanks ....) Any fixes planned?<br>
Yeah, changing the way it works. Long term, we want Guardian less focused on dodge more on AM. High armor and health are cool. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363740719384494084))<br>

How does vengeance diminishing returns determine which is the primary vengeance target and which targets get reduced?<br>

Outside of armor and stamina, what else would a tank look for in an upgrade to increase survivability?<br>
Haste makes a fine mitigation stat for paladins. It&apos;s not hard to imagine a role for crit and mastery is already tanky. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362451947866955779))<br>

You are being overly vague when it is clear as day that hunters (of all classes) have the least variety in their specs by far.<br>

I don&apos;t know why you think spriest is fine, but you really should consider taking a closer look at the spec. It has issues!!<br>

Same issues Shadow, indeed priests as a whole, always had; mobility issues. All it would take would be Phantasm base<br>

But isn&apos;t a lot of the ability bloat today due to CDs? Som rotational abilities, but a LOT of CDs, too.<br>

Possible MM hunters will be viable (progression raiding) again in 5.4? Haven&apos;t been able to play my favorite spec since 4.2 <br>
It&apos;s tough. We&apos;d like for it to be a choice, but if websites say MM is 2% higher than SV/BM, a whole lot of players switch. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363738251216953345))<br>

We&apos;re not convinced Fire is going to scale out of control. Beyond say 50% crit or so, the value starts to decrease. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362460821000949761))<br>
I&apos;m finding it very hard to swallow this statement, and so does other DPSers who compete with mages. Elaborate?<br>
Fire&apos;s DPS is a little high in ToT. We were worried they were going to scale much higher in SoO, but it may not happen. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362616356199346176))<br>

Do you think we spam heal HR and EF bubble the raid because we like it? There is no alternative, and 5.4 doesn&apos;t add any<br>
It&apos;s just the hot proc&apos;ing and constantly refreshing the absorb that made the EF healing style a no-brainer. We want options. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362459127131287552))<br>
Ideally you could use LoD when clumped and EF when you wanted more finesse and didn&apos;t mind targeting multiple people. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362458964216119296))<br>
I don&apos;t target,I mouseover. Explain me how the 5.4 changes are making that happen in any way.<br>
Using LoD vs. EF (minus bubbles) don&apos;t feel any different to you? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362460290706706432))<br>
I just use LoD whenever 3hp or DP procs. No thought behind<br>
Then that sounds like the hot on EF needs to be stronger. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362463572401455104))<br>
<br>
Why does devotion aura still only work on phys dmg, hpalas will be the only healer without raid cds on some fights in siege.<br>
Because it&apos;s very good in other situations. Encounter designers often consider Devo Aura the one they need to balance around. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362462464417337344))<br>
<br>
And don&apos;t say jack of all trades. Every Holy Priest knows that has never ever worked.<br>
You think it should be bubbling the whole raid with EF spam? That&apos;s what we&apos;re trying to avoid. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362371464323796992))<br>
For the last time, we AGREE that EF blanketing had to be removed in some way. However, we need a different NICHE in return.<br>
Not all paladins agree. That&apos;s mainly who I&apos;m talking to. I am glad you do though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362455509506326528))<br>
My view is that you&apos;\re not changing our EF blanketing ways. You&apos;re just making us worse at it in 25<br>
Then perhaps we haven&apos;t hit the sweet spot for SH and SS tuning (and possibly LoD). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362461452247891969))<br>
If you take EF, we&apos;re kind of okay with that. If every Holy paladin still does, then I agree we haven&apos;t fixed the problem. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362461535274151937))<br>
<br>
jack of all trades is inevitable given 10m raiding now - every healer must be able to do &apos;everything&apos;. Less specialty = less fun.<br>
To a point, but a druid and monk use pretty different spells to heal. We can&apos;t say e.g. druid you will be a bad tank healer. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362459575707910144))<br>
It might be possible to bucketize the healers into a ST or AE healer and then dictate you need one of each. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362459810068828160))<br>
Not sure that design is superior though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362459844248207360))<br>
<br>
I guess the only way to put through to you the state of hpally is to say &quot;We told you so&quot; when they are bottom of every fight.<br>
If by bottom you mean HPS, isn&apos;t the EF nerf like &lt; 5% HPS? Doesn&apos;t sound very harsh. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362073100080250880))<br>
EF nerf is way bigger than 5%. Seriously, would you have even had it on your radar if it was that little?<br>
So what am I missing? How is it way bigger than 5%? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362367412600971264))<br>
And we lose more than 5%. Hpallies lose their playstyle. And &quot;new&quot; playstyle with SH is not fun for 95% of community<br>
Not sure you can speak for 95% of the community, but if around 30% chose SH, that would be just about ideal. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362458541782597632))<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t think they weren&apos;t fair,but taken like a direct % you forget that EF is spread and that it refreshes IH to 45 secs.<br>
Yeah, EF spreading is cool and should be a strength of choosing that talent. It&apos;s just IH that makes it the only choice in 5.3. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362449863251726336))<br>
<br>
Last but not least, why are you still dodging the 5.4 Pala niche question? U said you don&apos;t want us EF bubbling the raid...<br>
I don&apos;t like niche questions in general because I feel like players try to use them to lawyer us too much. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362448969961439232))<br>
If I say druids are supposed to be the masters of hots, then folks drag that out whenever they cast a non-hot or someone else hots. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362449149842567170))<br>
Our intent is that specs have depth and nuance, and that doesn&apos;t compress nicely into 140 characters. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362449219656753152))<br>
But I think it is fair to say that nobody went into MoP thinking paladins were the masters of hot based absorbs and needed more. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362449344542146560))<br>
We just overbuffed Eternal Flame at the last minute before launch. Perhaps it even masked weaknesses in other areas. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362449469373022208))<br>
<br>
Let&apos;s say EF does 13% of your healing+absorbs. So the hot does 3-4% of total healing+absorbs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362366214133125121))<br>
Even EF&apos;s refreshing the absorb is an important aspect, one that you keep forgetting.<br>
No I think that&apos;s fair, though it&apos;s hard to quantify as part of the mythical &quot;way bigger than 5%.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362369706243522560))<br>
And SOI nerf was 10% of our total mana gained per fight, new DP &quot;compensate&quot; ~3-4%<br>
But if you only count the healing (say about 50%) then EF&apos;s HoT was only 6-7% of total healing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362366795644018690))<br>
This means absorbs are going to be reduced to 93-94% of what they currently are, or a loss of 6-7% of absorbs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362367070706466818))<br>
If your absorbs are 50% of healing+absorbs, then you&apos;ll lose about 3% of your total throughput. BoL loss would be a little more. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362367367591895042))<br>
But it also leads to the whole &quot;I can&apos;t function without EF&quot; which isn&apos;t the design we want for paladins. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362369797377372160))<br>
I&apos;ve said this a few times, but we never balanced paladin mana around 100% SoI uptime because we knew that wasn&apos;t realistic. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362371301115047936))<br>
<br>
Most of us Holy paladins are going to get the boot from our raiding guilds with all these damn nerfs!!!<br>

what&apos;s the reasoning behind the Judgment mana increase? Are there other changes coming?<br>
Paladins dropping all Spirit to use SH wasn&apos;t the intent. We&apos;d rather it compete on utility / HPS grounds not super efficiency. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362075747650772993))<br>
But monks dropping all Spirit is fine? Even with 9k Spirit and old SH we could barely compete in 10s.<br>
Monks don&apos;t do it if they choose the right talent. We don&apos;t think the mana or tools choice for paladins would be very fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362081692573368321))<br>
<br>
Biggest Ret AE problem is having to choose ST/AE Talents/Glyphs OOC and be stuck with them the whole fight.<br>
That&apos;s part of the intent though. If you have everything available precisely and only when you need it, there&apos;s no choice. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362075331399647233))<br>

Also not sure the glyph is the right call. I worry we caved beneath the &quot;I must have destealth!&quot; crowd. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363736835429629955))<br>
Can Shadow get something to cast while moving? We can&apos;t Pain because it wipes our DoTs. Fel Flame if you are feeling lazy?<br>
We don&apos;t want to add a new spell at this stage, but we would like to solve the problem. This is one of those hate snapshot deals. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363465364446785536))<br>
SoO does have a lot of multidot fights though and we can make sure Shadow is up there with Affliction and Balance on multidot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363467101127704577))<br>
And multidot in turn has a better chance of being able to use SW:P while moving, because there&apos;s a non-snapshotted target. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363467230878515201))<br>
Some one already suggested getting mindspike back up to something usefull, idea?<br>
For example, Mind Spike with no dot removal &gt; Mind Flay if I&apos;m not mistaken. There&apos;s also the talent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363735793832960000))<br>
<br>
Do you have any plans to fix the latency on Shadow Word: Death&apos;s activation?<br>
There is no easy way to do that since the game has to detect that the target is injured. Longer term it might be possible. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363730992122441729))<br>
<br>
not sure if it&apos;s true but I saw a PWS nerf on MMO champion, unfortunately the post vanished.Just curious if you plan on a nerf<br>
Nothing beyond the Rapture change already in as far as I can recollect. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363404770792308738))<br>
<br>
what would you think about letting #spriest charge orbs out of combat, similar to moonkin, so we can pull with 3 orbs? #wow<br>
We&apos;d rather do the opposite and drain all resources when combat begins. It&apos;s just complex to do. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363403026318368769))<br>

Have you guys got any plans to look at making combat the top rogue spec? playing mostly assass for 3 patches is getting old!<br>
We wish Combat were closer, yes. In 5.2(?), we wanted to nerf C&apos;s cleave and buff their ST, but don&apos;t think we buffed it enough. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362464287651921920))<br>
<br>
You mentioned agreeing rogue specs need to be looked at. Any thing to discuss currently? Warlock level rehaul in the future?<br>
Note that is GC random musings, not any kind of official announcement. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362457857234436098))<br>
Unlikely to be at the warlock level with vastly different resources. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362457571346489345))<br>
More on the table would be something like one spec has Rupture, one uses Recuperate rotationally, and one uses SnD. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362457707149656066))<br>
<br>
why are you evading all rogue questions ? The class has had nearly no attention throughout mop, less than Shaman!<br>
Because we&apos;re pretty happy with rogues. We did make several talent changes throughout MoP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362462633485533184))<br>

Glyph of Everlasting Affliction has been replaced by Glyph of Eternal Resolve - wow no one wants that crappy change<br>
Glyph of EA was a trap for most players. Duration less useful because of snapshotting. What did you like about it? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363739410262528002))<br>
(I should add that UVLS and Wild Imps felt like an exploit more than a cool mechanic.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363739515002687488))<br>
<br>
Also make Harvest Life back into an AOE spell - stop with the crappy changes to us locks. So far 9/10 lock changes so far suck<br>
We found hardly anyone was using Harvest Life. That&apos;s not always the only concern, but we didn&apos;t think it was salvageable. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363738606214455296))<br>
<br>
Do you regret adding so much unique utility in MoP? It&apos;s too powerful to ignore from a heroic raid leading perspective.<br>
Not really. Demonic Gateway is the only one that feels like a must have to us. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362451288333619202))<br>

Will we ever see heroic leap remove snares? Druids can literally spam out of roots and dps pressure, but heroic leap is 30secs<br>
We don&apos;t want you to feel like you have to save Heroic Leap for snare removal. That mechanic already dominates Safegaurd. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363734575303766016))<br>
Though see recent Safeguard change on the PTR. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363734625903837184))<br>
<br>
are u ever going to change the warrior rotation spamming 105# wep dmg with no bonus apr is the reason warriors do so low dmg<br>
We changed the warrior rotation for MoP, and the Arms rotation almost every patch. Are you sure you mean &quot;rotation?&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363733272951406592))<br>
<br>
Is there a reason hitting heroic strike during Ultimatum removes a stack from Glyph of Incite?<br>
I think we fixed that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363402748915499008))<br>
<br>
Will tank damage really be more in in line in 5.4. It seems like prot warriors will again be at the bottom.<br>
That&apos;s not the intent. We haven&apos;t tuned them yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363399909371682816))<br>
<br>
Still near worthless in PVE. Almost every other class has a (near) immunity effect or dmg absorption.<br>
That sounds like it would increase class homogenization to give warriors one then. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362452946585264129))<br>
<br>
Any thoughts on Fury DPS being a tad low, combined with our mediocre defensive cooldowns? 5.4, Fury isn&apos;t really shining.<br>
Fury&apos;s defensive cooldowns are fine, IMO, especially with the change to shields. My hunch is their DPS is too low in 5.4 ATM. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362358951964196865))<br>

Weekly News Recap<br>
Another busy week full of news, so here is your chance to catch up! <br>
<br>
<br>
July 28<br>
<br>
We looked at the Stormcrow mount (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3320-Patch-5-4-Stormcrow-Mount-Ghostcrawler-Interview-Blue-Posts-News-Recap).<br>
Ghostcrawler did an interview:<br>
<br>
Patch 5.4 is the final raid patch for Mists of Pandaria and ends with players defeating Garrosh and setting events in motion for a new warchief. Unfortunately, we will have to wait a little bit longer to see who that will be. <br>
WoW won&apos;t be going free to play anytime soon, as Blizzard is happy with the current business model. Even if they wanted to make it into a microtransaction based game, it couldn&apos;t be done with how gameplay works today. <br>
The devs want people to be able to catch up faster so that they can play with friends, which is why they are testing the experience buff (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/146939-enduring-elixir-of-wisdom) and other convenience items in the Blizzard store. There is no desire to move towards a pay to win style game.<br>
<br>
<br>
July 29<br>
<br>
We looked at the new Timeless Isle armor (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3321-Ghostcrawler-Interview-Timeless-Isle-Armor-5-4-Notes-Update-Blue-Posts-TCG-Art) coming in Patch 5.4. This will add a relatively easy to obtain set of item level 496 gear, and a set that you can grind for that is item level 535. Patch 5.4 normal difficulty gear has an item level of 553, while flex gear is 540, and raid finder gear is 528.<br>
The Patch 5.4 PTR notes were updated with another round of class changes.<br>
Ghostcrawler did another interview:<br>
<br>
The item level squish (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2541-The-Great-Item-Squish-%28or-Not%29-of-Pandaria) might take place next expansion. (See tweet (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362307978944200705))<br>
The Lesser Charms that may be added to the Asian store are there as a convenience item for players that may not have time to do their daily quests that week or players who just want to save time. There are no plans to add items to the store that will increase player stats.<br>
<br>
<br>
July 30<br>
<br>
Ghostcrawler replied to some item level squish feedback (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3322-Item-Level-Squish-Kor-kron-Dark-Shaman-5-4-RPPM-Mechanics-Change-Blue-Posts-Art).<br>
We looked at the Kor&apos;kron Dark Shaman encounter (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3322-Item-Level-Squish-Kor-kron-Dark-Shaman-5-4-RPPM-Mechanics-Change-Blue-Posts-Art) in Siege of Orgrimmar. <br>
Some changes to RPPM mechanics (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265372-change-to-rppm-mechanics/) were announced.<br>
<br>
July 31<br>
<br>
We looked at the UI for the in-game store (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3324-Patch-5-4-In-Game-Store-Patch-5-4-Mage-Glyphs-Blue-Posts-Blue-Tweets-DLC-400).<br>
We looked at the new mage glyphs (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3324-Patch-5-4-In-Game-Store-Patch-5-4-Mage-Glyphs-Blue-Posts-Blue-Tweets-DLC-400) coming in Patch 5.4.<br>
<br>
August 1<br>
<br>
The Q2 Earnings call took place: <br>
<br>
Titan will not be a subscription based MMO. Blizzard is still working on a new direction and plan for the project.<br>
The decline in subscribers in Q2 was more evenly split between Asia and the West.<br>
The subscriber churn rate was very positively impacted by Patch 5.2 and 5.3.<br>
Blizzard All-Stars is in wider internal testing and will be talked about more later this year.<br>
<br>
There was a new PTR build (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3327-Q2-Earnings-Call-Patch-5-4-PTR-Build-17260):<br>
<br>
Some new Bind on Account epic weapons (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-build=17260&amp;filter-bind=10&amp;filter-quality=16) were added, but the item levels aren&apos;t final.<br>
The Throne of Thunder debuff (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/149070-shado-pan-onslaught#17247-17260) has been added.<br>
Siege of Orgrimmar loot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-build=17260) has been added, making for 100s of new items in this build. <br>
<br>
<br>
August 2<br>
<br>
We looked at the Stormwind Harbor (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3328-SoO-Stormwind-Harbor-5-4-Notes-Update-RPPM-and-Haste-Changes-Blue-Posts-TCG-Art) that is part of the Siege of Orgrimmar encounter. <br>
The Patch 5.4 PTR notes were updated (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3328-SoO-Stormwind-Harbor-5-4-Notes-Update-RPPM-and-Haste-Changes-Blue-Posts-TCG-Art) with several more class changes.<br>
More RPPM changes were announced (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265372-change-to-rppm-mechanics/), this time dealing with how Hast interacts with RPPM mechanics. We listed the value changes in this table (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3328-SoO-Stormwind-Harbor-5-4-Notes-Update-RPPM-and-Haste-Changes-Blue-Posts-TCG-Art).<br>
Personal loot is eventually coming to dungeons (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265536-stop-ninja-looting-in-nilla-dungeons/#post31).</div></div>
