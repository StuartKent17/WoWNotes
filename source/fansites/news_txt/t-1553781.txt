Warlords of Draenor - 7/15 Beta Invite Wave
A sizable invite wave went out tonight, allowing many more people to join the beta testing for Warlords of Draenor. Bashiok also explained a little bit more about how invite targeting works.


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/betaWaves.png https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/489134331621699585 

Targeting was at subscription length + recent activity of accounts who are of course opted in to beta test on the website. So account creation date wasn't necessarily a factor, although of course those with a lot of sub time also have old accounts. Also it was a target and not a guarantee, and so certainly not everyone who has been playing a long time got one.

But more are going out to opt-ins every week, and there are fansite and gaming news site giveaways. Plenty of additional opportunities every week.

does everyone get a base multistrike %? Don't have beta yet so can't test
No, no global base amount. A few specs have passives which some though. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/486984248239202304
...which *grant* some. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/486984348726358016

also also about mirror images. Giving mages an ability we've had for years as a lvl90 talent isn't fun or exciting gameplay.
It does like 3000% more damage now though! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487124787219947520

Will a warrior have to commit to glad stance before a bg starts?
In its current implementation, yes. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486692395853950978

Warlords of Draenor Stats
Is Rating -> % conv. going to be the same for Crit and Multistrike? If so, it feels like Crit will always be numerically better.
Nope. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/486578932733337600
Good to know. Are we going to see Multistrike Damage bonuses > 30% the way we do with Crit? > 100/50%
Yes, but they're very rare. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/486580609829969921

PvE
Is it realistic to expect we will frequently switch gemming and enchanting, esp given stat attunements?
The average player? Maybe not. A top 10 guild tank doing progression? Wouldn't surprise me at all. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/486553679156109312

With most ench/gem/reforg gone, how do we promote build diversity aside for drop RnG. It's fairly important during progression.
But enchanting and gemming aren't gone? Also flask/food is a good chunk of secondary stats - you can make large stat adjustments. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/486547707033432064
I was under the misguided maybe? impression that available enchants and gem slots are severely reduced in WoD?
They're consolidated into fewer slots, so you can wear more gear instantly, but each enchant you do have is more impactful. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/486554000611753985

In other words, will heroic dungeon gear be powerful enough for normal mode Highmaul?
Absolutely. Normal Highmaul is tuned for Heroic dungeon blues, and Normal Highmaul will be open before LFR. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/487307632336568322
Question, is that Normal which is "Flex" now, or "Normal" right now?
If I ever talk about Warlords raids, I'm using the 6.0 difficulty names. So, the former. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/487348672955285505
Follow-up inquiry, what is Heroic Highmaul tuned for?
"Tuned for" can be misleading. Tuned to be done in Normal Highmaul gear by the audience for which Heroic is the likely endpoint. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/487353582153256960
But Mythic-caliber raiders should be quite able to do Heroic Highmaul without much/any Normal gear. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/487353794821246977

PvP
Any chance at getting a few more bgs for low levels, random bgs xp <3
Actually yes! We are going to redistribute when battlegrounds come available. More at lower level. Also Random BG at level 20. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486708244673355776

I don't play much. I did however start at release and saw the game wither away since Cata.
Arena participation grew 50% over the course if the expansion. Not dead, growing. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486510623522447360

constant new rewards take resources. motivation at top end is a recognition issue, maybe in game ladder UI to show off?
Definitely thinking about ways to improve rewards and progression in PvP. Any change would need to be clearly better. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486539455558213634

we going to see an different version of nagrand arena in WoD? Maybe more #savage
One of our longterm goals is to improve the visuals of the arenas while preserving their layouts. More to come on that. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486618427243511808
awesome, looking forward to see what is to come. Cant wait testing out Ashran when its on beta, druid ready to explore n kill! 
We're working to get Ashran playable in Beta very soon. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486619350787297282

then what about shooting through a hill in a bg map? Is that latency to?
No terrain does not break LoS in WoW. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486679086027124736

so do you think they will ever make an arena that is wide open? Nowhere to hide type arena
No, line of sight and positioning are a critical part of arena PvP holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486514428557275138
of unless you are a caster or hunter who can shoot through solid objects. Which has been a problem for years
In arena? Barring latency, the objects in arena do block line of sight. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486677424709464065
so all the complaints about shooting through solid objects is being blamed on latency.
do you have any specific examples? Generally, objects in arena break LoS. But for moving targets, latency matters. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486678785438146561
for instance, on my client, I may see myself behind the pillar, but on your client I haven't made it there yet. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486678894502633473
is that something that is trying to be fixed in WOD?
No because it's the nature of online multiplayers games. Synchronization is often sacrificed for responsiveness. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486682572747845632

I remember you asking how to increase arena participation a while back. *hint*hint*
We are creating new Vicious mounts of the Combatant achievements. It was very effective for increasing participation. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486679600164896768

I remember seeing something about the window for getting the vicious saddle being extended. True or am I just imagining things?
The vicious saddle will be available each season. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486676717855981568
The same one available for s14 is still obtainable now then? Just trying to be sure to clear up confusion between friends and I
You can obtain one Vicious Saddle per character each season. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486677271650902016

Well you can't really blame people. I don't give a crap about store mounts, but your answer was kinda poor and now deleted
The irony is that we're already making more PvP mounts. I know people are upset, but we are doing what they want. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486581329257955328
1 Ground mount per expansion isn't what people want. Again you presume to thin you know what we want.
who said one per expac was the plan? I think you are making assumptions. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486965201506287617
Sorry, it's actually two. For each faction. That's what we got for MoP. Did the plan change for WoD?
We hope to do 2 per season as long as we can. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486983058914955265

Lore
So Dave, outside Pandaria are there any beings to compare the celestials to? Or are they unique?
The ancients Goldrinn, Aviana, etc are just like Celestials. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/486725641375469568

WHOA! The elements on Draenor want balance? They aren't fighting with early h other or mortals for supremacy?
Unlike Azeroth, they don't seek the end to all, but the balance of all elements. The Breakers have other plans... Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487127217265442816

Garrisons
are there any negative ramifications for bulldozing your plots?
There is a cost in garrison supplies, but there are also a ton of ways to obtain them mostly through adventuring! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/486391208621928449

Why the cut to only 3 small garrison plots? Forces picks for the player now, Storehouse or Salvage only choice.
What would you have done with 4, specifically? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/486692681116958720
I'm afraid of losing that impressive base feel, that houses a true army. Less complete base now.
It's still REALLY big, and full of stuff. Looking forward to feedback when t3 unlocks for sure. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487121503902003201

Yep, more alts with Garrisons...
Fine line to walk, rewards per alt. Didn't work out well on the farm. Check out garrison capacity system. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487123825176625152

What type of armor will non-human and orcs have? People are nervous around Worgen in Stormwind plate.
They come in the armor of their origins, Night Elf sentinels will look like sentinels, etc. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487051828266164224

Can we have a variety of racial guards? Not just one race, but a combination of orcs, trolls, etc?
There are some plans to allow you to customize where your guards come from e.g. what main city Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487009561329401858
You mean faction right? Cause there are races without cities.
Yes. You can have all worgen guards and call it Dogfort. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487017272725106688
Please say Pandaren will be included in this.
Yup! Even some Shado-pan may choose to show up... Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487051981563781121

UI / Addons
you said earlier no "new stuff for arena frames" - not even letting us scale/move them? Or do we have to rely on scripts?
Those frames are reusing the boss frames. We'd prefer to do a more comprehensive overhaul. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486686106990034944
Is it actually on the list, or something you'd simply like to do?
On the list of things we'd like to do... holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486700418173382657
