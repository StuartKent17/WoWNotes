You might have seen a few spam posts on the front page a few minutes ago, it didn&apos;t last long but I guess it&apos;s worth an explanation. First, we didn&apos;t get hacked, it was just a small error with moderation. We do not delete spam posts, we just move them to a trash can forum where they can die happily with all their friends.<br>
<br>
The problem is when I don&apos;t sleep enough in a night and actually move 6 of these posts in the &quot;News&quot; forum instead of the &quot;Trash Can &lt; Spam Goes Here&quot; forum. This is how these posts appeared on the front page.<br>
<br>
Everything is under control, you are now free to laugh at me and you can stop worrying. <br>
<br>
Also, Patch 3.2.2 is not this week.</div></div>
