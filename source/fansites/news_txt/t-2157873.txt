WoW Token Temporarily Disabled
We've encountered a brief technical issue with the WoW Token system which has resulted in it temporarily being disabled in the Americas, Oceanic, and European regions. We're hard at work to restore functionality and will have it back up and running as soon as possible. 

Thank you for your patience.

But the ones we have in our inventory will still function properly, yeah? We just can't purchase them?
Yep!


Patch 7.2 PTR - Build 23445 Delayed
Brief update: we've encountered an issue with this build which is preventing us from actually pushing it to the PTR. We're still hoping to get it out this week, but it'll be tomorrow at the earliest.

Items

Aluriel's Mirror http://www.wowdb.com/items/140795-aluriels-mirror: Healing-over-time effectiveness increased by 140%. Area of effect healing detonation effectiveness reduced by 35%.

Developers’ Notes: Aluriel’s Mirror’s detonation effect is strong when it activates, but hard to rely on. We’re increasing the heal-over-time effect significantly to improve the up-front value of this trinket, and reducing the detonation effect slightly to compensate.

Animated Exoskeleton http://www.wowdb.com/items/140789-animated-exoskeleton: Absorb amount increased by 33%.
Arcanogolem Digit http://www.wowdb.com/items/140794-arcanogolem-digit: Damage increased by 30%.
Claw of the Crystalline Scorpid http://www.wowdb.com/items/140790-claw-of-the-crystalline-scorpid: Damage increased by 30%.
Convergence of Fates http://www.wowdb.com/items/140806-convergence-of-fates:

Frost Death Knight Proc rate increased by 10% with Empower Rune Weapon, decreased by 23% with Hungering Rune Weapon.
Unholy Death Knight Proc rate increased by 68% with Summon Gargoyle, and no change with Dark Arbiter.
Feral Druid Fixed a bug that prevented Incarnation from working properly with Convergence, and no change with Berserk.
Windwalker Monk Proc rate decreased by 62% with Storm, Earth, and Fire, and decreased by 75% with Serenity.
Retribution Paladin Proc rate increased by 250% with Avenging Wrath, and increased by 25% with Crusade.

Draught of Souls http://www.wowdb.com/items/140808-draught-of-souls: The Use effect of this trinket now respects the global cooldown. The damage of this trinket is now reduced by 30% for Unholy Death Knights was reduced by 40%.

Developers’ Notes: Since Draught of Souls deals Shadow Damage, it’s increased by Unholy’s Mastery, which means we needed to reduce its base damage to keep its overall value similar to other classes. It’s currently a little too low, however, so we’re increasing the damage it deals for Unholy.

Entwined Elemental Foci http://www.wowdb.com/items/140796-entwined-elemental-foci: The amount of Critical Strike, Mastery, and Haste granted by this item has been increased by 5%.
Etraeus' Celestial Map http://www.wowdb.com/items/140803-etraeus-celestial-map: The amount of Critical Strike, Mastery, and Haste granted by this item has been increased by 5%.
Fury of the Burning Sky http://www.wowdb.com/items/140801-fury-of-the-burning-sky: Damage increased by 40%.
Icon of Rot http://www.wowdb.com/items/140798-icon-of-rot: Damage increased by 40%.
Might of Krosus http://www.wowdb.com/items/140799-might-of-krosus: Damage reduced by 25%, but is now always a critical strike. Also, fixed a bug where the cooldown was incorrectly being reduced if Might of Krosus damaged at least 3 targets. The tooltip for Might of Krosus will display the amount of damage that will result from the critical hit, not the base damage.
Perfectly Preserved Cake http://www.wowdb.com/items/140793-perfectly-preserved-cake: Absorb amount increased by 140%.
Pharamere's Forbidden Grimoire http://www.wowdb.com/items/140800-pharameres-forbidden-grimoire: Damage increased by 85%.
Star Gate http://www.wowdb.com/items/140804-star-gate: Damage increased by 30%.
