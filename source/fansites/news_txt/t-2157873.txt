WoW Token Temporarily Disabled
We've encountered a brief technical issue with the WoW Token system which has resulted in it temporarily being disabled in the Americas, Oceanic, and European regions. We're hard at work to restore functionality and will have it back up and running as soon as possible. 

Thank you for your patience.

But the ones we have in our inventory will still function properly, yeah? We just can't purchase them?
Yep!

Items

Aluriel's Mirror  Healing-over-time effectiveness increased by 140%. Area of effect healing detonation effectiveness reduced by 35%.

Developers’ Notes: Aluriel’s Mirror’s detonation effect is strong when it activates, but hard to rely on. We’re increasing the heal-over-time effect significantly to improve the up-front value of this trinket, and reducing the detonation effect slightly to compensate.

Animated Exoskeleton  Absorb amount increased by 33%.
Arcanogolem Digit  Damage increased by 30%.
Claw of the Crystalline Scorpid  Damage increased by 30%.
Convergence of Fates 

Frost Death Knight Proc rate increased by 10% with Empower Rune Weapon, decreased by 23% with Hungering Rune Weapon.
Unholy Death Knight Proc rate increased by 68% with Summon Gargoyle, and no change with Dark Arbiter.
Feral Druid Fixed a bug that prevented Incarnation from working properly with Convergence, and no change with Berserk.
Windwalker Monk Proc rate decreased by 62% with Storm, Earth, and Fire, and decreased by 75% with Serenity.
Retribution Paladin Proc rate increased by 250% with Avenging Wrath, and increased by 25% with Crusade.

Draught of Souls  The Use effect of this trinket now respects the global cooldown. The damage of this trinket is now reduced by 30% for Unholy Death Knights was reduced by 40%.

Developers’ Notes: Since Draught of Souls deals Shadow Damage, it’s increased by Unholy’s Mastery, which means we needed to reduce its base damage to keep its overall value similar to other classes. It’s currently a little too low, however, so we’re increasing the damage it deals for Unholy.

Entwined Elemental Foci  The amount of Critical Strike, Mastery, and Haste granted by this item has been increased by 5%.
Etraeus' Celestial Map  The amount of Critical Strike, Mastery, and Haste granted by this item has been increased by 5%.
Fury of the Burning Sky  Damage increased by 40%.
Icon of Rot  Damage increased by 40%.
Might of Krosus  Damage reduced by 25%, but is now always a critical strike. Also, fixed a bug where the cooldown was incorrectly being reduced if Might of Krosus damaged at least 3 targets. The tooltip for Might of Krosus will display the amount of damage that will result from the critical hit, not the base damage.
Perfectly Preserved Cake  Absorb amount increased by 140%.
Pharamere's Forbidden Grimoire  Damage increased by 85%.
Star Gate  Damage increased by 30%.
