<br>
<br>
Why are They Different?<br>
While the basic skeleton model for each of these races resemble existing ones, each race will have unique customizations and racials.<br>
<br>
<br>
More in the Future<br>
While there are only 6 Allied Races to start, there are more planned in the future.<br>
<br>
<br>
How to Unlock<br>
Allied Races are unlocked via preliminary requirements that lead to a quest chain done on your main character to bring the race into your faction. Once completed, the Allied Race will be available in the character creation options account-wide. Preliminary requirements can include becoming exalted with the Allied Race&#x2019;s faction from previous expansions such as Highmountain or the Nightborne.<br>
<br>
<br>
What Level/Where do They Start At?<br>
Allied Races begin their journey at level 20. The current plan is for them to start in the main hub of their respective faction (Orgrimmar and Stormwind) and level wherever they see fit within the new old world scaling technology.<br>
<br>
<br>
Level Boost/Race Change<br>
You are able to level boost and race change to an Allied Race once it is unlocked on your account.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;h3&gt;Heritage Armor&lt;/h3&gt;After you unlock an Allied Race, leveling one to level cap will unlock a race restricted armor transmog unique to that race. This must be done by actually leveling and not through level boosting or race changing. These transmogs are armor agnostic, meaning they can be transmogged on any type of armor.<br>
<br>
<br>
Faction Embassies<br>
In the BlizzCon demo, Stormwind and Orgrimmar each had a new building that served as a hub for recruiting their Allied Races. The quests to unlock each race was given out in a manner similar to your artifact weapon acquisition.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;h3&gt;Alliance Races&lt;/h3&gt;Alliance players will have access to the Dark Iron Dwarves, Lightforged Draenei, and Void Elves. <br>
<br>
Dark Iron Dwarves: Led by Magni Bronzebeard&#x2019;s (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Magni_Bronzebeard) daughter Moira Thauissan (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Moira_Thaurissan), the Dark Iron Dwarves are known for their dark skin and fiery features. The clan has resided mostly in the Blackrock Mountains until the death of their previous ruler, Dagran Thaurissan (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dagran_Thaurissan).Their relationship with the Alliance has been rocky at best, but with Moira joining Ironforge&#x2019;s Council of Three Hammers (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Council_of_Three_Hammers), the Dark Iron Clan is slowly finding a place within its ranks.<br>
