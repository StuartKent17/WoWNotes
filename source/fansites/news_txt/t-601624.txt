Of course, these informations aren't officialy from Blizzard, and you should trust them only if you're stupid/intelligent enough to trust this site. Probability this is real : 70%, according to our fake-o-meter

We've also got the first screenshot of a Death Knight http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/deathknight.jpg but ... It looks like a fake to me *cough*. Dwarves are biggers.
