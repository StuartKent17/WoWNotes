Patch 6.2.2 Release Date<br>
As you might have seen in the latest update to the 6.2.2 PTR Patch Notes, our current plan is to release Patch 6.2.2 on September 1.<br>
<br>
Please keep in mind that this release date is not set in stone, as we are continuing to iron out bugs with 6.2.2&#x2019;s content, including some related to enabling flight in Draenor. That said, we are optimistic that we&#x2019;ll be able to have everything ready by then, so we wanted to share the current plan. We know many players -- us included! -- are excited to take to the skies above Tanaan Jungle and the rest of the Draenor continent.<br>
<br>
<br>
Patch 6.2.2 Change Clarifications<br>
Hail, hero of Azeroth! The time has come to acknowledge/address faction imbalance!<br>
We recognize there&apos;s a problem. It&apos;s why we&apos;ve been nerfing the Human racial and implementing things like Merc Mode. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634045580503678976))<br>
merc mode doesn&apos;t help Horde. It helps ally queue times. You stated so yourself! <br>
It does help Horde, by giving Horde more people to play with.<br>
Maybe...we&apos;ll see how that plays out. Horde rated needs bodies, which means people actually on the red side.<br>
Also - and I couldn&apos;t say this an hour ago - we&apos;re buffing several Horde racials. (aa (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634080044432752640))<br>
<br>
Would it not be fair to give a discount or maybe even a free faction change when massive racials changes happen like this?<br>
The goal is not to push everyone over to Horde, just shore up some Horde racials that are underperforming. I&apos;ll ask about it, though. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634081794107682817))<br>
and doing it in the current season is totally fine.<br>
<br>
That would be underperforming in PVP Josh? as the top 10 progressed PVE guilds are all Horde.<br>
Yes, in PvP. The racial changes have little to no real PvE impact. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634083547221876736))<br>
maybe I&apos;m just being cynical but I don&apos;t think 30s on Rocket Jump cd is going to have a major impact on the ladder.<br>
To be honest with the listed changes I don&apos;t believe anyone is doing it to be goblin. Even if they&apos;re cool.<br>
Sure. I also don&apos;t think that another 5% on Hardiness or Voodoo Shuffle are going to have any noticeable effect.<br>
With a majority of comps relying on stuns to kill or silences blood elves and orcs will def rise to the occasion.<br>
Yeah, maybe. IDK I still think Stoneform or Shadowmeld are really strong and easily on par. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634086333095391232))<br>
<br>
Why not just get rid of all active racials and let people decide what to play based on looks/friends and not fotm.<br>
We like racials. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634084398950805504))<br>
We still like the actives, and disagree that they cause big problems (as long as they&apos;re tuned appropriately) (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634084398950805504))<br>
I guess issue is many horde actives offensive, all ally actives defensive. Some horde actives good in pve, not so much ally.<br>
Maybe. That&apos;s an interesting point. I&apos;ll bring it up. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634085331881431040))<br>
<br>
Will these 10% more 10% less in pvp be nerfs or will they deal the same as now in pvp. Wording is not clear.<br>
+10% base, then -10% in PvP. So a very slight (~1%) nerf to those abilities, but a buff to Mind Flay. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634085162926518272))<br>
<br>
hey can you clarify the feral damage changes. does that mean it&apos;s unchanged in pvp?<br>
Buffed by 20% baseline, then reduced by 20% in PvP, so a very slight (~4%) nerf . (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634088240509616128))<br>
<br>
Would have been much better to have the cast time removed from War Stomp. Still suspectable to push back and DPS loss.<br>
I don&apos;t think a 0.5 second cast is too much to ask for a 3-second AOE stun (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634102424622473217))<br>
But a 3-second silence gets a pass?<br>
Stuns are significantly more powerful in more situations than silences. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634104466510376960))<br>
<br>
Bring back the strong Will of Forsaken!<br>
WotF is exactly the same as it was in Mists when everybody was undead (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634105005511999488))</div></div>
