Addon - Premade Filter<br>
Today we are taking a look at the Premade Filter (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/premade-filter) addon. This addon allows you to filter group finder results to just list the groups you are interested in. The author is responsive to feedback in the comments on the addon page (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/premade-filter#comments) and also has a topic on the forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1672267-AddOn-Premade-Filter?highlight=premade+filter).<br>
<br>
The addon description page has lots of details and the in game UI has some additional help, but here are some of the more helpful features:<br>
<br>
<br>
Set your criteria and search for new groups in the background, with chat notifications.<br>
Tooltips show the number of each class and their role in the group.<br>
Require or exclude specific words in the title or description.<br>
Filter by the number of each role already in the group.<br>
Filter by item level requirement and voice chat. <br>
Filter by specific bosses being dead or alive.<br>
Filter out realms from specific regions.<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
PvP<br>
People can play RBG&apos;s at 2700+ without skype so I think 5v5 objective PvP would work solo/duo Queue if done right <br>
If I ever do an interview, ask me my views on solo queue rated and I&apos;ll share them with you. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575833336947478529))<br>

Heroes and WoW PvP<br>
Masochist tweet of the night: Do you play WoW and Heroes of the Storm but you don&apos;t PvP in WoW? I&apos;d love to hear why. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575496853396963328))<br>
<br>
because you can&apos;t balance WoW PvP worth anything, man. its no fun mongo training healers<br>
As much as people want to blame balance (and me) many don&apos;t get to the point where they could form a proper opinion about it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575501794484355072))<br>
He just did, but you just ignored it because you&apos;re more worried about answering soft-balls, like gear differences.<br>
The people I&apos;m talking about are the average WoW player, not someone who has poured hours into arena. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575504632824229888))<br>
It takes a long time playing a game to develop familiarity enough to say &quot;I don&apos;t like the balance here.&quot; (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575504768493203456))<br>
I&apos;ve played World of Warcraft since 2009, Holinka. I&apos;ve been a competitive PVPer for 3 years. I think I understand.<br>
Right, you have a lot of experience. He&apos;s asking the people who *aren&apos;t* experienced why they don&apos;t. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/575505295612514305))<br>
If you&apos;ve been a competitive PvPer for 3 years, my original question was not directed at you. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575505032730316800))<br>
Yes, and perhaps the SAME ISSUES that we hate are the reason? It isn&apos;t FUN.<br>
We get a lot of feedback from PvPers about PvP. That&apos;s awesome, and we continuously work to improve on those issues. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/575506685441142784))<br>
But we don&apos;t get as much feedback from people who *don&apos;t* PvP at all about why not. It&apos;s an interesting topic. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/575507075498950656))<br>
Should probably try acting on the feedback of the people who do PvP first. That would be progress already<br>
We already have a process for that. It just doesn&apos;t involve twitter. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575507751599665152))<br>
<br>
I like in Heroes that I can change my character every game, in WoW if I want to PvP as another class I have to level/gear up fully<br>
good feedback thanks (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575501429542023168))<br>
<br>
heroes is more balanced than wow pvp <br>
I know hardcore people will jump on this but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the reason for the average player. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575498733405782016))<br>
<br>
respectively and imho it has to do with gear disparity. If you don&apos;t get in early, it&apos;s frustrating dying so quickly.<br>
it&apos;s good feedback thanks (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575498945461358592))<br>
<br>
for me this season felt like a chore to gear up, the obligation to play if you wanna compete can be a drag!<br>
So make it so you can compete without playing the game. Got it! (Just kidding I know what you mean) (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575500953341857793))<br>
<br>
cont...3) I can play multiple characters and not have to level them. 4) No PvE changes that affect PvP. 5) combat is faster<br>
Good feedback thanks (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575502191663845377))<br>
<br>
in pvp, you expect to die. Pvers have a hard time dealing with the paradigm shift.<br>
Understand that...but in this case, the PvP mindset is obviously not the problem, because they play Heroes. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575759515435450368))<br>

New World of Warcraft Short Story: Code of Rule<br>
In the days before the Iron Horde invaded Azeroth and tightened its grip on all Draenor, Warchief Grommash Hellscream sought every advantage in his quest to conquer (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/savage-world/code-of-rule/page-1) the orcish world completely.<br>
<br>
The ogres of Highmaul once ruled Nagrand&#x2014;and they still exert control over land and sea from their capital. They are massive obstacles to orcish dominance; obstacles that Hellscream himself has a highly personal (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/savage-world/lords-of-war/) stake in removing.<br>
<br>
Faced with the prospect of extinction before a growing Iron Horde, the Sorcerer King of the ogres, Imperator Mar&#x2019;gok, plots to ensure Highmaul&#x2019;s survival at any price. But what can Mar&#x2019;gok offer those who so eagerly seek his people&#x2019;s demise?<br>
