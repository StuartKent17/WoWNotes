Legion - Storm Dragon Mount<br>
The Storm Dragon mount is one of the new mount models added in Legion. There isn&apos;t an entry in the mount journal yet, so we don&apos;t know the source.<br>

How will glyphs that don&apos;t alter spells be handled? (i.e. priest glyph of angels)<br>
Things like Confession, Treant Form, Illusion likely learned from tomes. Angels likely triggered by a certain spell. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675414085123506176))<br>

Will DH&apos;s GCD be 1 sec or 1.5 sec? Also are there any plans to alter any other classes GCD?<br>
1.5 second base, reduced by haste (similar to most other non-energy melee). (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675412587752787968))<br>

holy paladin in legion raiding, stand in melee? Or back with range? Or bounce between the two groups?<br>
Depends on the fight. Sometimes Holy Paladins will prefer to stand with ranged, sometimes with whomever they&apos;re healing. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675412274039808000))<br>

Any chance Pistol Shot for Outlaws might see unique animation/unique gun? Gret concept let down by a Vanilla Blunderbuss model<br>
The current art for Pistol Shot in the Legion Alpha is temporary. It will have a new gun and animation. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675117660259135488))<br>

So will aff/destro locks have any form of burst cooldowns other than summon Doomguard/Infernal since dark soul is gone?<br>
There are a few talents that improve burst, and the Doomguard/Infernal are being buffed to deal significantly more damage. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675411821210169345))<br>
<br>
Artifact Wepaons<br>
Will our artifacts be able to unlock additional relic slots at some point?<br>
Artifacts start with 2 relic slots and unlock a 3rd shortly after reaching 110. We&apos;re not planning any additional slots. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675118010940702720))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
does this mean tank specs will be viable in PvP also?<br>
We&apos;re looking into ways to make tanks fun - both to play as, and to play against - in PvP. It&apos;s a tough challenge. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675119169545875456))<br>
<br>
why not just make racials unavailable for pvp?<br>
We feel racials are an important part of what defines your character, and should come into PvP with you. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675119332217790470))<br>
<br>
Lore<br>
Mr.Koask could you please clear the situation with Vol&apos;Jin? You said he is warchief and in quests it&apos;s Sylvanas! what happened?<br>
If you&apos;re checking out the alpha, you&apos;re only getting part of the story, none of the intro, and none of the cinematics. Yet! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/675098136067645440))<br>
<br>
Transmogrification<br>
Rumor from alpha is clothies can unlock cloth transmog but plate cannot. Intended behavior?<br>
Intended. Plate wearers unlock plate, mail wearers unlock mail, etc. Weapons must be equippable by that character. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675118823566147584))<br>
<br>
If I unlocked the CM armor during MOP on one warlock, if I make another will I be able to XMOG it on him with the new system?<br>
Yep! Any characters of the same class will be able to wear the Challenge Mode sets if you&apos;ve unlocked them. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675429731626430464))<br>
Can we discuss that &quot;Weapons must be equippable&quot; thing for staves/polearms?<br>
I refuse to discuss polearms after &quot;the incident&quot;. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/675431004249579520))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
I see. I was watching some legion alpha streams and artifact stuff looks promising, can&apos;t wait to test/play it.<br>
I agree. Looks cool. Shades of Paths of the Titans, down to titan names. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672585490617405440))<br>
<br>
How do you keep your team motivated when deadlines loom and setbacks start to/have happened? How do you boost morale?<br>
One of the best things for morale is shipping things and seeing it in the hands of players / customers. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672861236120322048))<br>
Newbie managers sometimes focus too much on individual feelings during a time of crisis. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672861332417327104))<br>
When actually your team may thank you later for being decisive when Shit Gets Real. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672861568426631169))<br>
You can focus on the softer aspects of team morale when you have more bandwidth and fewer deadlines looming. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672861648273604609))<br>
<br>
Hey, GC, how hard is it to take a wow boss mechanic, like Shadow Crash, and make it a player ability? Is it technically hard?<br>
If it&apos;s tied to the room geometry (target this x,y coordinate) then it can be hard. A lot of class abilities started with bosses. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/673143612075458560))<br>
<br>
I understand, do u think redesigning classes every xpac is a good idea? I despise having to relearn the specs I play esp. 1/2<br>
I like class change. I was sad in WoD when the direction was minimal change. But having to relearn is the big risk. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/673144132601184256))<br>
<br>
what is a Devs definition of &quot;Balance&quot; equal everything or as close as balanceable?<br>
Depends on devs and projects. Usually it&apos;s something like decisions of what / how to play aren&apos;t driven by raw power. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/674042467474214913))<br>
<br>
Systems designers distinguish between &quot;balanced&quot; and &quot;balanceable&quot; and focus more on the latter since it&apos;s a lot harder. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/673989369959698432))<br>
how do unbalanceable things form? i.e. by what general mechanism does a system/mechanic become unbalanceable?<br>
Things are balanceable if they have tuning knobs. A switch with on/off lacks tuning knobs. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/674042966801956864))<br>
An ability that is &quot;kill next target&quot; doesn&apos;t scale with target health or power, so you lack an ability to tune it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/674043220888698880))<br>
<br>
like why make it balancable if you don&apos;t then use that work to try achieve balance.<br>
Totally. Balance is the end goal and the most important in the end. We just talk about the hard part which is balanceable. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/673997803002003456))<br>
Sadly, what isn&apos;t balance-able is community perception. Once they believe something is bad, it&apos;s hard to change that view.<br>
That&apos;s true, but players don&apos;t owe use endlessly trying something to see if it&apos;s finally fixed yet. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/674248424988917760))<br>
