Death's Advance http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96270/deaths-advance/ may now not allow movement-impairing effects to reduce the death knight below 60/75% of normal movement speed, down from 75/100%.
Death and Decay http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/43265/death-and-decay/ no longer damages the death knight's currently selected friendly target when it does damage to nearby target dummies.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid / Cataclysm Talent Calculator http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..druid / Skills/Talents http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1117-Druid-Cataclysm

Starfall http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48505/starfall/ no longer exceeds 20 stars within its duration.
Mangle Bear http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/33878/mangle/ and Maul Bear http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/6807/maul/ damage has been increased by approximately 10%.
Frost Nova http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/122/frost-nova/, Tranquility http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/740/tranquility/, War Stomp http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/20549/war-stomp/, and Starfire http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48505/starfall/ are all properly scaled when used by or on a druid in Tree of Life form http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/65139/tree-of-life/. The previous temporary hotfix which removed the ability to use War Stomp while in Tree of Life form has been reverted.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter / Cataclysm Talent Calculator http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..hunter / Skills/Talents http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1118-Hunter-Cataclysm

Auto Shot http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75/auto-shot/ was not firing while the hunter was moving under certain conditions. Auto Shot should now always function correctly while the hunter is moving.
Having a melee weapon equipped no longer causes the tooltips for Cobra Shot http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77767/cobra-shot/ and Steady Shot http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/56641/steady-shot/ to incorrectly display extra benefit from haste.
The cooldown for Master's Call http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53271/masters-call/ has been increased to 45 seconds, up from 35. In addition, it can now be dispelled.
The Warp Stalker ability Time Warp http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/35346/time-warp/ can no longer be used on paladins with the Divine Shield http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/642/divine-shield/ buff active.

The Quad Core http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/70747/quad-core/ buff provided by the Sanctified Bloodmage 4-piece set bonus is now properly removed as soon as a spell is cast if the mage does not have 4 pieces of the set equipped.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin / Cataclysm Talent Calculator http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..paladin / Skills/Talents http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1670-Paladin-Cataclysm

Glyph of Dazing Shield http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/59560/glyph-of-dazing-shield/ correctly causes Avenger's Shield http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31935/avengers-shield/ to daze the target, and only allows Avenger's Shield to trigger the dazed effect.
The area-of-effect attack of Hammer of the Righteous http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53595/hammer-of-the-righteous/ no longer has a chance to miss secondary targets when the primary attack hits the paladin's target. If the primary attack of Hammer of the Righteous fails to hit the target due to miss/dodge/parry/block, no enemies will be affected by the area-of-effect attack. Rogues who are under Cloak of Shadows http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31224/cloak-of-shadows/, however, are able to resist this damage.
The Warp Stalker ability Time Warp http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/35346/time-warp/ can no longer be used on paladins with the Divine Shield http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/642/divine-shield/ buff active.


http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest / Cataclysm Talent Calculator http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..priest / Skills/Talents http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1123-Priest-Cataclysm

Inner Focus http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/89485/inner-focus/ can no longer be cast before the effect of its preceding spell completes Inner Focus will only be applied to spells that are cast after it.
Sin and Punishment http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/87100/sin-and-punishment/ now works properly when two players of the same faction are fighting each other including in Arenas. A string error may appear when the opponent is feared even though the talent functions correctly.

Gouge http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/1776/gouge/ is now breaking properly from spell and ability damage.



http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock Forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock / Cataclysm Talent Calculator http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..warlock / Skills/Talents http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1125-Warlock-Cataclysm

All raid bosses are now properly immune to Suffering http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/17735/suffering/ Voidwalker taunt ability.


Dungeons & Raids
Blackwing Descent

Drakeadon Mongrels can now be taunted.
The debuff from Pyreclaw's Flame Buffet now only lasts 8 seconds.
The Golem Sentry's http://www.wowpedia.org/Golem_Sentry Flash Bomb damage has been reduced in the 25-player version.
The health of Drakeadon Mongrels and Drakonid Slayers has been reduced in 10- and 25-player versions.
Nefarian's http://www.wowpedia.org/Nefarian_Blackwing_Descent_tactics Blazing Inferno http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/76195/blazing-inferno/ damage and knockdown radius has been reduced to match the spell effect graphic.


Items

Some Vicious Gladiator's weapons item level 359 incorrectly had their costs increased. This has been corrected. Two-hand and ranged weapons now cost 3400 Conquest Points, while one-hand and caster weapons now cost 2450 Conquest Points.
All Vicious Gladiator's weapons item level 372 have been temporarily removed from the Glorious Conquest Quartermasters until the time is right to officially introduce them into Azerothian society.


PvP

Many items incorrectly rendered unusable in rated Battlegrounds and Arenas have been made usable again.


Battlegrounds
Battle for Gilneas

The banners at each capture point now take 8 seconds to capture, up from 5. Note that when the banners are neutral and have not yet been captured by either faction at the start of a battle, they will display the wrong location names Mine says Farm, Waterworks says Blacksmith, and Lighthouse says Stables.


Races

Gift of the Naaru http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/59544/gift-of-the-naaru/ now has a maximum limit to the amount healed when used on friendly NPCs with large amounts of health.
