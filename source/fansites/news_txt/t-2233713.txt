Curse of the Dreadblades Artifact trait now works with Ambush.
Fortune Strikes redesigned. Now increases Combat Potency’s proc rate by 2% per point was +1 Energy per Combat Potency proc per point.

Developers’ notes: The net result of the two Combat Potency and Fortune Strikes changes is that Combat Potency should generate half as much Energy, twice as often.

Restless Blades has returned. Finishing moves reduce the remaining cooldown on Adrenaline Rush, Between the Eyes, Sprint, Grappling Hook, Cannonball Barrage, Killing Spree, Marked for Death, Death from Above, Vanish by 0.5 seconds per combo point spent.
Slice and Dice http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5171 now increases attack speed by 125% was 100%.

Buried Treasure increases Energy regeneration by 30% was 25%.
Grand Melee now increases attack speed by 55% was 50%.
True Bearing causes Finishing moves to reduce the cooldown of many abilities by 1.0 seconds was 2.0 seconds per combo point.


Subtlety

Developers’ notes: Our overall goals are to remove uncontrolled player teleport from the baseline DPS rotation, to reduce the frequency of teleporting in PvP, to allow players to choose between more frequent or more impactful Shadow Dances, which equates to more frequent CC/utility or damage in PvP, to keep the PvE rotation engaging, and to make Symbols of Death more engaging.
All damage dealt increased by 20%.
Backstab http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53 base damage increased by 35%.
Backstab http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53 damage bonus from being behind the target reduced to 20% was 30%.

Marked for Death http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/137619’s cooldown reduced to 40 seconds was 60 seconds for Subtlety.

Developers’ notes: This is to balance it against Premeditation, which is now on the same row. It’s a buff in a raid setting, where the talent was very weak.

Master of Shadows http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/196976 now gains 25 Energy over 3 seconds when you enter Stealth or Shadow Dance.

Developers’ notes: Pooling energy going into a Shadow Dance has long been the way to play Subtlety, and we’d like to bring that back. This design still gives you more energy for a Shadow Dance, but in a way that allows the Rogue to fully utilize pooling gameplay.

Nightblade http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/195452 now increases your damage dealt to the target by 15%, with damage over time component reduced by 35%.

Developers’ notes: Further pushes Subtlety away from maintaining Nightblade on all secondary targets and instead into focusing their damage into 1 target. Additionally, gives Nightblade a mechanical interaction with the rest of the core rotation that fulfills the “setup” feel of Subtlety.

Premeditation http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/196979 has been removed.
