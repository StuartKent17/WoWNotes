Boubouille2008-02-06, 10:12 PMUpdate - Added today's news to the post. Blue posters have been surprisingly calm yesterday, that's not the first time but it could mean great things for today. 

Notes about the class changes list
A longer explanation might get the attention of most of the users. The list posted yesterday IS NOT from the patch notes, it's more than likely a leak from an internal mail/meeting discussing potential changes for classes. 90% of them probably won't be in the initial release of the 2.4 Patch on PTRs and even if they're added later, keep in mind that you'll be playing on a TEST server used to ... test changes and see how it works with enough people to gather an accurate feedback. 


Spell haste and Global Cooldown
In 2.4, Spell haste will let you decrease your global cooldown, Nethaera explains how efficient it will be.
With haste gear you can work toward lowering the GCD down to 1 second, but it will take more than just gear to max it. 
You can max it with the use of both haste on gear and abilities/talents.


Raid UI changes in 2.4
Another feature has been added to the raid UI in 2.4
The Raid UI now can display the range of players relative to you. The option to enable this is in the Party & Raid section of the UI Options.


Blizzcast Episode 2
The Episode 2 of the Blizzcast is currently in post-production and will probably be released in the the upcoming weeks. Bornakk reminds people that you won't necessarily see tons of new things here.

If you missed the first Episode you can download it here  or just check its page  on the official site for a transcript/stream.
And to build off what was said, the tag line at the top of the official BlizzCast page is "Taking you deeper into the world of Blizzard." While new game/content information might be discussed from time to time, that isn't the primary goal. Instead we want to bring some unique perspectives to the variety of aspects involved in making games and our company in general.


2.4 Potential class changes
Read this first
It's unconfirmed and potentially fake 50% chance I'd say
Most of these changes won't be in the initial release of the 2.4 Patch on PTR, it's more a todo-list for classes changes than a full list of changes at the release.
According to the source, they're a list of changes that Blizzard will like to experiment on the PTRs. You won't see them in patch notes until Blizzard decides or not to test them on a PTR build. That's why they're called TEST servers



The "Blue posters are always right" minute
What we've posted on the forums is the extent of the notes we've made public at this point in time. The complete official notes have not been posted yet. Please take anything posted outside the forums or website with a grain of salt.

This could perfectly be a fake, seriously, if you didn't read this before going through the changes you'll probably make a hundred of puppies sad.
