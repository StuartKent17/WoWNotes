Stoy2019-06-18, 12:03 AMPatch 8.2 - Blizzard Responds to Experience Eliminated Aura
I don’t want my XP to be 5% because some random troll que’d up on twink char and joined our group.
This won’t happen. The change only affects groups that manually invite player characters who have XP off. There is no impact on players who find themselves automatically grouped by the matchmaker while doing PvP or Group Finder dungeons.

This change also doesn’t affect anyone who has turned off XP for their own benefit, such as plundering old raids while keeping their level low enough to use their Aggramar’s Stride boots.
