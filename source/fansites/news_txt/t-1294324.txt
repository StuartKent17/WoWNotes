Ghostcrawler on Tri Spec
More replies today to the Tri Spec tweet http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3232-Heirloom-Shields-Ghostcrawler-on-Tri-Spec-April-30-Hotfixes-Blue-Tweets-Fan-Art from yesterday!
All the classes already feel the same thanks to you.
We try to strike a balance between the demands for "I need X tool that the other guy has" and classes still feeling cool. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329753630137802754

Specs should be saveable, e.g. equip sets. Keep talents, glyphs, action bars. Limit could then be set to 3, 4, 5 w/e
Yeah, we think an approach like that would take the hassle out of it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329754437725859840

Could you explain the logic behind tri-spec diminishing class uniqueness? more choices = more variety. 
You no longer think of your friend as a Feral or a Balance druid. She is just a druid who can fill any role just like any druid. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329758932774039552

If you were really serious about this statement, a character would be permanently limited to 2 of the 3 specs.
The intent of letting you remake choices was never supposed to be "I can swap to anything at a moment's notice." Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329760054200909825
It was supposed to be "I made a decision that now I really regret and wish I could make over." Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329760165333200896
I do worry sometimes that dual spec solved a problem talent points were a pain to rebuy that no longer exists. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329759928753471488

World Boss Kill Status
We are aware of the request and looking to add a way for characters to track which world boss had already been defeated in a given week.

Hey! Sorry if this has been asked before, but there was talk about letting us hide weapon enchant glows iirc. Idea scrapped?
Not scrapped. Just not sure yet on the right design. It gets into the issue of weapon transmog pretty quickly. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/326870634279890944

I don't understand why rings are unique-equipped, is it too game breaking to have two of the same kind? Any plans to change?
You only get so many gear slots, so chasing the same BiS piece for two just removes some of the gearing options / opportunities. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/326446309424918529
That's understandable, but going for BiS is completely optional and nothing something all players do, I'm no expert but...
Unfortunately, we find the opposite. Many players expect BiS and even consider the second place item to be "garbage." Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/326453033359794177

I like the new talent system but it makes leveling kinda unrewarding. Long stretches where you get nothing.
Agree. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/326447222856220672

As a corollary, that mean healers lacking mitigation should actually be leading "meters", Yet, the opposite is true.
Most players would do well to compare their own performance night to night and stop worrying about what everyone else does. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327959748706197505
Either remove the ability of HPS meters/WoL to work,or balance the game around it.Cant change everyone's minds
Neither of those seems like a reasonable response to misinterpretation of data. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/328223580523462656

Do you feel that the shared achievements have worked out for 10 and 25 man raiding? Any plans for the future?
We think shared is fine, but it would be nice to be able to determine which version someone earned the achievement in. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327876976977264640

Buff Naturalist another 10% please, resto druids are bottom of logs in pve and burst pvp far outstrips resto driuds heals
Logs aren't a great way to measure healing done. Just as one example, PW:Barrier doesn't show up while Tranq does. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327882826856931328

Why are shaman and druids doing so poorly this expansion in pve healing?
We think shaman are fine. We think druid hots get trumped a lot by absorbs, esp. paladin and Disc's. 5.3 changes should help. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327870726398963713

Just witnessed some major BrM hate in LFR lost 2 perfectly fine tanks because of their lower health pool, so many hate on BrM
That's just a weird perception. Brewmasters can tank anything. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329316087776821249

Eternal Flame blanketing with paladin mastery is so strong. Why not revert the mastery nerf and make EF HoT not stack mastery.
We buffed EF just before release and have regretted it ever since. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327874313933955072
Mastery was too strong regardless, but longer-term we don't want EF to be the only choice for Holy. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327874259718377472
Could you follow up with a why? EFin a 25h raid implies much greater skill then keeping up SS+using LoD
Eternal Flame has like 90%+ use for Holy. That means they effectively lose a talent choice. If some used SS then it would be fine. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327882509880803328
Keep in mind: to drop EF for SS, LoD needs to be viable. It's not good enough atm.
LoD just has to beat WoG, which it does. Eternal Flame is the problem. It lets Holy become a Resto druid and a Disc priest. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327959047611498496

Recent Q+A mentioned more with shields - possible future choice for Ret a la War TG/SMF? 1h-shield Ret sounds interesting!
I think there is some interesting design space for offensive shield use. The 300s Spartans don't feel like Prot warriors to me. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327868317043920896

I think retri pala still needs some special/unique ability to be picked up for "serious" games in pvp. What do you think?
Not crazy about the idea of 34 unique abilities to ensure that every spec gets picked up for PvP. Just feels like an arms race. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327871859209166848

Was Rain if Fire intended to be part of Destruction single target rotation? Any plans to change it? Sorry if it's a repeat q
Not crazy about it. We don't want to change it for 5.3 in the middle of a tier, but maybe 5.4. We could buff embers in other ways. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327957210099511296
An idea I had was to make RoF only generate embers if it hits at least 3 targets. What do you think about that?
Something like that would be fine. Just need to make sure single target ember generation doesn't feel too slow. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/328227081689374720

That's irrelevant. People use Heroic Leap as a gap closer and not for it's DPS, especially with the nerf to the glyph.
If they're using it as a gap closer, then they don't need to worry about minimum range. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329313967581323265
