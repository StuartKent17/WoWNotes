Ghostcrawler on Tri Spec
More replies today to the Tri Spec tweet  from yesterday!
All the classes already feel the same thanks to you.
We try to strike a balance between the demands for "I need X tool that the other guy has" and classes still feeling cool. Source 

Specs should be saveable, e.g. equip sets. Keep talents, glyphs, action bars. Limit could then be set to 3, 4, 5 w/e
Yeah, we think an approach like that would take the hassle out of it. Source 

Could you explain the logic behind tri-spec diminishing class uniqueness? more choices = more variety. 
You no longer think of your friend as a Feral or a Balance druid. She is just a druid who can fill any role just like any druid. Source 

If you were really serious about this statement, a character would be permanently limited to 2 of the 3 specs.
The intent of letting you remake choices was never supposed to be "I can swap to anything at a moment's notice." Source 
It was supposed to be "I made a decision that now I really regret and wish I could make over." Source 
I do worry sometimes that dual spec solved a problem talent points were a pain to rebuy that no longer exists. Source 


Blue Posts
World Boss Kill Status
We are aware of the request and looking to add a way for characters to track which world boss had already been defeated in a given week. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Hey! Sorry if this has been asked before, but there was talk about letting us hide weapon enchant glows iirc. Idea scrapped?
Not scrapped. Just not sure yet on the right design. It gets into the issue of weapon transmog pretty quickly. Source 

I don't understand why rings are unique-equipped, is it too game breaking to have two of the same kind? Any plans to change?
You only get so many gear slots, so chasing the same BiS piece for two just removes some of the gearing options / opportunities. Source 
That's understandable, but going for BiS is completely optional and nothing something all players do, I'm no expert but...
Unfortunately, we find the opposite. Many players expect BiS and even consider the second place item to be "garbage." Source 

I like the new talent system but it makes leveling kinda unrewarding. Long stretches where you get nothing.
Agree. Source 

As a corollary, that mean healers lacking mitigation should actually be leading "meters", Yet, the opposite is true.
Most players would do well to compare their own performance night to night and stop worrying about what everyone else does. Source 
Either remove the ability of HPS meters/WoL to work,or balance the game around it.Cant change everyone's minds
Neither of those seems like a reasonable response to misinterpretation of data. Source 

Do you feel that the shared achievements have worked out for 10 and 25 man raiding? Any plans for the future?
We think shared is fine, but it would be nice to be able to determine which version someone earned the achievement in. Source

Buff Naturalist another 10% please, resto druids are bottom of logs in pve and burst pvp far outstrips resto driuds heals
Logs aren't a great way to measure healing done. Just as one example, PW:Barrier doesn't show up while Tranq does. Source 

Why are shaman and druids doing so poorly this expansion in pve healing?
We think shaman are fine. We think druid hots get trumped a lot by absorbs, esp. paladin and Disc's. 5.3 changes should help. Source 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Just witnessed some major BrM hate in LFR lost 2 perfectly fine tanks because of their lower health pool, so many hate on BrM
That's just a weird perception. Brewmasters can tank anything. Source 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Eternal Flame blanketing with paladin mastery is so strong. Why not revert the mastery nerf and make EF HoT not stack mastery.
We buffed EF just before release and have regretted it ever since. Source 
Mastery was too strong regardless, but longer-term we don't want EF to be the only choice for Holy. Source 
Could you follow up with a why? EFin a 25h raid implies much greater skill then keeping up SS+using LoD
Eternal Flame has like 90%+ use for Holy. That means they effectively lose a talent choice. If some used SS then it would be fine. Source 
Keep in mind: to drop EF for SS, LoD needs to be viable. It's not good enough atm.
LoD just has to beat WoG, which it does. Eternal Flame is the problem. It lets Holy become a Resto druid and a Disc priest. Source 

Recent Q+A mentioned more with shields - possible future choice for Ret a la War TG/SMF? 1h-shield Ret sounds interesting!
I think there is some interesting design space for offensive shield use. The 300s Spartans don't feel like Prot warriors to me. Source 

I think retri pala still needs some special/unique ability to be picked up for "serious" games in pvp. What do you think?
Not crazy about the idea of 34 unique abilities to ensure that every spec gets picked up for PvP. Just feels like an arms race. Source 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Was Rain if Fire intended to be part of Destruction single target rotation? Any plans to change it? Sorry if it's a repeat q
Not crazy about it. We don't want to change it for 5.3 in the middle of a tier, but maybe 5.4. We could buff embers in other ways. Source 
An idea I had was to make RoF only generate embers if it hits at least 3 targets. What do you think about that?
Something like that would be fine. Just need to make sure single target ember generation doesn't feel too slow. Source 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
That's irrelevant. People use Heroic Leap as a gap closer and not for it's DPS, especially with the nerf to the glyph.
If they're using it as a gap closer, then they don't need to worry about minimum range. Source 


Fifth Element: Avengers - Dark Animus Kill
Another nice intro from Fifth Element !
