chaud2018-01-04, 12:37 PMBattle for Azeroth PvP Changes Recap
Battle for Azeroth is making substantial changes to World PvP as well as adding more arenas and a new battleground!


New Arenas
Two new arenas are being added to the game. One will be set in Tiragarde Sound and the other in Zuldazar.


  


World PvP

The PvP vs PvE server distinction is going away, replaced by a toggle set by each player. You can toggle being opted into PvP or not when you are in town. 
Players that feel trapped on PvP servers now have a way out. This opens up the game to changing and improving the World PvP rule sets. 
There are two main audiences: Players that play on PvP servers because that is where they ended up that don't really want to be there and players that love World PvP and want more of it. 
New content like bounty hunting or assassination quests can be introduced as an option now. 
There will be bonuses to experience, reputation and other things when you are questing with PvP mode enabled to offset the inefficiency.
The team hopes this will build a foundation to make World PvP great again. 



 


Island Expeditions - PvP Mode
Island Expeditions take some of what the team liked from Mists of Pandaria's scenarios. These expeditions take a team of three players of any roles to uncharted islands across the Great Sea in search of Azerite  Each island is randomly generated, so there is always something unique and new about the experience. This feature uses advanced AI in its Normal to Mythic difficulties, but teams of three players from the Horde and Alliance will also be able to queue up against each other in a PvP version!


      


New Battleground: Seething Shore
In Patch 7.3.5 a new battleground called the Seething Shore will be introduced. This new battleground takes place in Silithus  and features the Horde and Alliance descending upon the wound that Sargeras  put in Azeroth to fight over Azerite bubbling to the surface.


Dynamic control point game play- Both factions will fight to control points on the map that are not always in the same spot. Control points are random and have many different spawn locations.

New Brawls
There are no specifics on new PvP brawls being added to the game, but Blizzard has stated that more are coming in Battle for Azeroth.


PvP Talents
The team has said that there isn't likely to be any substantial changes to PvP talents but do plan to make rotations more similar between PvP and PvE.

How do you view PvP templates?
The team likes the PvP talents, however, it is hard to put that into the outdoor world. They recognize how unbalanced World PvP is. The team wants you to be able to customize your character more in PvP. They are looking at the scaling technology to use within PvP, basically using the same tech that lets low levels party with higher levels. They are reworking the reward structure in PvP.


Official Preview
While there are many new PvE experiences waiting in Battle for Azeroth, there are also some new PvP updates for players to look forward to.

In a new Battleground, Seething Shore, players of the Horde and Alliance will descend upon Silithus to battle over the Azerite bubbling to the surface. This Battleground will offer dynamic control point gameplay similar to Arathi Basin, but with new control points appearing periodically as resources are depleted. This new Battleground will require coordination as you and your team work to overcome the opposing faction. Since this Battleground actually serves to tell part of the story that leads to the events of Battle for Azeroth, we also plan to offer a preview of the Seething Shore during patch 7.3.5 as we continue to build upon the conflict between the Horde and the Alliance for the coming expansion.

Beyond instanced PvP, we’re also reexamining how PvP plays out in the outdoor world. The PvP system hasn’t fundamentally changed since the launch of World of Warcraft; however, so many other systems that shape the world, ranging from flying mounts to cross-realm zones, have changed the way players interact. We’ve heard feedback lamenting the decline of world PvP over the years. Meanwhile, there are players on PvP servers who don’t necessarily enjoy that gameplay, but also don’t want to switch servers and leave their friends behind. Looking ahead to Battle for Azeroth, this feels like a great opportunity to update the PvP system to better reflect the state of the game world today.

The core of our plan lies in bringing all servers together under a single PvP ruleset. Players will ultimately be able to choose on an individual basis whether they want to opt in to PvP gameplay or not. While in a capital city, you’ll be able to opt into world PvP, and you will venture out into a PvP-enabled version of the world, populated by other players who have also opted in to PvP gameplay. This also provides a universal foundation upon which we can build new world PvP systems that previously would have inherently excluded everyone playing on a PvE realm.

For those who do opt in to the PvP experience, there will be some slight bonuses such as extra experience gain or reputation gain to offset the additional risk. The nature and magnitude of these bonuses will undergo extensive tuning, with the goal of not making anyone feel obligated to participate in PvP if they dislike that gameplay, while counterbalancing the loss in efficiency for those who do.
