Patch 4.2 Mounts Preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2321-Patch-4.2-Mounts-Preview-Comics)<br>
<br>
<br>
In order to best accommodate players under the unique play style of Rated Battlegrounds, we&#x2019;ll be offering all-new PvP ground mounts -- the Vicious War Wolf (Horde) or Vicious War Steed (Alliance) -- in a unique way. If you want to sit your knickers on these sweet new rides come patch 4.2, Rage of the Firelands, you must earn achievements for winning either 75, 150, or 300 Rated Battlegrounds. <br>
<br>
One account-bound mount will be awarded for each of these achievements earned, so if you win 300 Rated Battlegrounds with a character, you&#x2019;ll be afforded the opportunity to give that character and two of your alts each a wolf or steed. Since these mounts are tied to each achievement and not to your placement on the competitive ladder, they will be awarded instantly rather than at the end of each season as with Arena mounts. Your Rated Battleground wins tracked for these achievements are cumulative and are not reset with each season, so you can work toward the reward at your own pace.<br>
