http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/us-en.png Legion PvP Season 3 US Cut-Offs<br>
Legion PvP Season 3 is ending soon, so we&#x2019;d like to once again share what we can regarding the rating requirements to earn end-of-season rewards.<br>
<br>
Last season, we looked at what the rating cutoffs were at the time and used those to estimate where they would end up at the end of the season. We got a lot of feedback indicating that this was confusing, so for this season we&#x2019;ll simply be providing the current cutoffs (at the time of posting) and updating them as regularly as possible. Note that we don&#x2019;t consider posting cutoffs in this way to be a long-term solution, and appreciate your patience while we work on other methods of providing these updates.<br>
<br>
Again, the below rating requirements are current only as of the most recent update to this post, and we expect them to rise significantly before the end of the season. We will update these as regularly as we can over the next week; you can tell how recently these cutoffs have been updated by checking when this post was last edited.<br>

Elemental Discussions - 7.2.5<br>
In any case, I was posting to flesh out the numbers I presented earlier. Assuming we hit the 3rd tick breakpoint (which is reasonable in M+ assuming you use sephuz) then accounting for the loss of Seismic Storm procs then we&apos;re looking at Earthquake needing to be buffed to 92.5% per tick to be equal to live Earthquake.<br>
<br>
9 Live EQ procs at 60% = ~540% SP<br>
9 SS proc chances @ 728% SP per proc with the current 5% proc chance = ~327.6% SP<br>
<br>
Total average damage as SP per EQ on live = 867.6% SP.<br>
<br>
6 PTR EQ procs at 78% = 468% SP<br>
6 SS proc chances @ 728% SP per proc with the current 5% proc chance = ~218.4% SP<br>
<br>
Total average damage as SP after the change = 686.4% SP<br>
<br>
In order to bring these two numbers together, the damage per Earthquake tick needs to be brought from 65% per tick to 95.2% per tick assuming no other changes are made.<br>
<br>
If we assume that the average haste is low enough that you get 8 ticks instead of 9, the average live damage is ~680%. That would require that Earthquake is brought up to ~79.13% damage per tick (474.8% SP over 6 seconds) to be equal to live.<br>
<br>
Edit: I forgot The Ground Trembles &amp; Call The Thunder in my original calculations. The numbers above have been updated appropriately.<br>
A simpler way of arranging this, if I understand you correctly, is:<br>
<br>
You&apos;re assuming that a typical live EQ has either 8 ticks (33.3% haste) or 9 ticks (50% haste including a proc of some kind), instead of the baseline 6. In that case, you would argue for (generously) a 50% buff to EQ and Seismic Storm, but at the minimum a 33% buff?
