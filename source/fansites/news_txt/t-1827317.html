WoW Americas Regionals $100,000 Prize Pool<br>
Two teams have already qualified for the World of Warcraft Arena Americas Regionals later this year &#x2013; one from North America, and one from Australia &amp; New Zealand. As we wait to learn who will be joining them from the Latin American Championship and North American Cups 2 and 3, we wanted to take a moment to share some exciting news about the Americas Regionals prizing!<br>
<br>
This year, teams who advance to the Americas Regionals won&#x2019;t just be competing to earn a spot at BlizzCon, they&#x2019;ll also be fighting for a share of an epic prize pool of $100,000. That prize money will be distributed among the 8 qualifying teams as follows:<br>
<br>
1st place team: $50,000 2nd place team: $20,000 3rd place team: $10,000 4th place team: $8,000 5th-6th place teams: $4,000 7th-8th place teams: $2,000 <br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re extremely excited about this year&#x2019;s Road to BlizzCon, and can&#x2019;t wait to share all of the details on the Americas Regionals (including when and where they&#x2019;ll be happening) with you soon. Good luck to everyone competing!<br>

Recent PvP Rewards Hotfix<br>
Looks like both changes made it in for maintenance today. All of the Wild Gladiator&apos;s armor pieces should now be available on the Conquest vendors, and there is no longer a 200-point Ashran restriction on the weekly Conquest cap.<br>
<br>
So, slightly technical details here, but for those who are asking:<br>
<br>
The issue with the Accolade trinkets is that there&apos;s actually just one item per primary stat (Strength, Agility, etc), which has a secondary stat randomly assigned when it&apos;s looted. We can&apos;t, for example, put the Int/Versatility trinket on a vendor, because that item doesn&apos;t actually exist -- there&apos;s just an Int trinket that can randomly have Versatility added to it.<br>
<br>
This means we don&apos;t have a way to implement a non-random method to get them via hotfix. We&apos;d need to add new versions of the trinkets to the game, and that requires a content patch. I don&apos;t know yet if that can happen in time for 6.2.1.<br>
