Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com) was updated with new items, one of them is particularly interesting.<br>
<br>
[Ashes of Al&apos;ar] &gt; Phoenix Mount !<br>
[Nexus-Prince&apos;s Ring of Balance] &gt; Drops from Yor (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22930)<br>
[Shaffar&apos;s Band of Brutality] &gt; Drops from Yor (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22930)<br>
[Band of the Crystalline Void] &gt; Drops from Yor (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22930)<br>
<br>
Some of you may ask if the mount is real, it is. Who dropped it ? Nobody. The mount was given to Ezra Chatterton during his trip to Blizzard HQs. But ... who is Ezra ?<br>
<br>
About a week ago, Tamara Chuang contacted me about this, but it was the 2.1.0 release and I couldn&apos;t really post the whole thing, and decided to send it to WoWinsider (http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/05/22/blizzard-and-make-a-wish-bringing-wow-to-life/) instead (thanks to them for writing this article). <br>
I won&apos;t cover the whole story, mostly because it&apos;s been done tons of time since the original post, and also because some people are better than me at doing this. <br>

A proof that Blizzard isn&apos;t that bad. And also that Tigole (=Jeffrey Kaplan) is nice, but we all knew that already.<br>

Hotfixes<br>

Pets are no longer affected by shatter from Gruul.<br>
Players with divine shield and similar immunities will now correctly receive credit for the quest &quot;The Ashtongue Ruse.&quot;<br>
The on-use abilities of the Commander&apos;s Badge, Captain&apos;s Badge, and Ancient Cornerstone Grimoire can no longer be used while in an Arena.<br>
The effectiveness of Lady Jaina Proudmoore and Thrall in Caverns of Time: The Battle for Mount Hyjal has been greatly reduced.</div></div>
