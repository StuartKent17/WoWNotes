Welcome to the Darkmoon Faire!
Blizzard detailed the new and existing aspects of the Darkmoon Faire today. We detailed the fish heads and coaster https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8384-Patch-8-1-5-Live-This-Week!#dmf earlier this year in our 8.1.5 guide.
Step Right Up! Try Your Luck!
A gathering of the exotic from around Azeroth and beyond!, the Darkmoon Faire is a celebration of the wondrous and mysterious. This mist-shrouded island is a conundrum wrapped in an enigma, accessible at the beginning of each month for one week only. Don’t be shy now, don’t be bashful—step right up for a tantalizing glimpse of what Faire founder Silas Darkmoon has in store for you!

New Attractions and Prizes!
The Darkmoon Faire returns this Sunday, April 7 with a brand-new roller coaster ride, new balloon-themed pets, and the latest haute couture fashion accessories: severed fish heads!

New: Darkmoon Faire Roller Coaster


https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/april/thumb/dmf01.png https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/april/dmf01.png

The Darkmoon Faire Roller Coaster is the longest, tallest, and fastest wooden roller coaster in Azeroth! Grip the edge of your seat as you get tossed around swerving through curves and taking terrifying plunges on this rickety track of twisting timber. There's no height requirement, so dwarves, gnomes, and goblins can ride without having to measure up.

Brave riders will be granted the WHEE! https://www.wowdb.com/spells/46668-whee buff, which increases experience and reputation earned for one hour. The experience gain will lend itself to collecting Heritage Armor sets and for unlocking Allied Races, including the recently released Kul Tiran humans and Zandalari trolls.

New: Pets


https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/april/thumb/dmf02.png https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/april/dmf02.png
