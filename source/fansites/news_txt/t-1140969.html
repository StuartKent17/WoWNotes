Wisdom of the Four Winds<br>
Once you reach level 90, which was unlocked in this patch, you are able to purchase Wisdom of the Four Winds (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115913) from a flight trainer for 2,500 gold. This will allow you to use flying mounts in Pandaria!<br>

Horde and Alliance Capital Cities in Pandaria<br>
If you are looking for an easy place to purchase that flight training from, look no further than the new Alliance and Horde capital cities that are located in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. <br>

Weather Effects<br>
We just added weather to all the zones in the last build. If you are not seeing it yet, just give it some time to show up. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/225458-pandaria-no-weather/) / Official Forum (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4903180408?page=3#56))<br>

Mage PvP<br>
The intent is that stronger player snares (such as Frost Bomb) should not overwrite weaker player snares (such as Frostbolt). Their effects won&apos;t stack, but the debuffs should persist.<br>
<br>
Example: You Frostbolt a rabbit. It gets the Frostbolt debuff and is snared by 50%. You then Frost Bomb the rabbit (under the assumption that you are really scared of this rabbit for some reason). The rabbit gets the Frost Bomb debuff and is snared 70%. However, it doesn&apos;t lose the Frostbolt debuff and two seconds later when Frost Bomb wears off, it is now snared at 50%.
