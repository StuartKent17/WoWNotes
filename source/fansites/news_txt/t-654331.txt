Boubouille2009-06-25, 09:48 PMUpcoming Isle of Conquest Changes
Based on player feedback and testing, we will be making several changes to Isle of Conquest in the next test realm build. We'd like to lay them out for you here in the hopes we're able to encourage continued participation and feedback.

Increased all the gates' health from 300,000 to 600,000.
Increased the reinforcement count from 200 to 400.
Significantly increased the health and damage of the keep generals.

Seaforium
Reduced effect range of the siege damage caused. Both the player damage and the siege damage caused should be 10 yards now.
The Huge Seaforium piles will now despawn for 20 seconds once looted.

Glaive Thrower
Reduced the cooldown of Blade Salvo from 60 seconds to 30 seconds.
Reduced movement speed.

Demolisher
The Hurl Boulder and Ram effects no longer share a cooldown.

Keep Cannons
Fixed a bug that was causing them to do much more damage than intended.
Keep Cannons can now be repaired once they are destroyed by clicking on them. This repair process takes 8 seconds and can be interrupted, similar to capturing a PvP objective.

Siege Engine
Significantly Increased health.

Your testing of this new Battleground thus far has proven invaluable and we ask that you please keep the feedback coming once these changes have been applied.
