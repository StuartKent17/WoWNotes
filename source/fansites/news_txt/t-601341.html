The Strider evading would then reset the entire encounter prematurely. We&apos;ve made a modification to the spawn point that should prevent this behavior. <br>
During Phase 2 of the Al&apos;ar encounter in Tempest Keep, Al&apos;ar occasionally charges at a random player. The damage dealt by the Charge was severe enough to immediately kill a lightly armored target even if the player was at full health. We&apos;ve reduced the damage done by this Charge ability. <br>

Totally unrelated, I added a map to the Skyguard Reputation Guide (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=253), not watermarked, you can use it anywhere. Will probably add a few things to it later, feel free to mention anything missing in comments. <br>
