Grand Expedition Yak Mount Preview
The Reins of the Grand Expedition Yak http://www.wowdb.com/items/84101 are sold for 60,000 gold before any discounts in a small village called The Grummle Bazaar, just outside of One Keg in Kun-Lai Summit. The mount is similar to the Reins of the Traveler's Tundra Mammoth http://www.wowdb.com/items/44235 in that it can hold up to three people, but has two vendors when you summon it. 

The Traveling Trader vendor will repair your gear and sell you food, water, a 14 slot bag http://www.wowdb.com/items/60335, and campfire materials. The other vendor is an Arcane Reforger, which allows you to reforge your gear wherever you can mount! The animations aren't done yet, as there is no mountspecial or jumping animation, but you can get a general idea of how it moves in the video below.
