WoWDB Addon Data Collection
You may have noticed that we are making slow and steady progress on WoWDB , but now we need some help from you! If you are using Curse Client , you can contribute data like mining node locations  and what a vendor sells  

To help out, just install the WoWDB Profiler addon  from Curse and check the box in the Curse Client options as seen below. When you are playing the addon will gather data and save it. When you are done playing, Curse Client will see the game close and upload the collected data from the addon. 

Don't forget to update your addons, authors have made lots of fixes since Patch 5.0.4!
