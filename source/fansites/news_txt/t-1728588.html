Coming soon to an Azeroth near you: the WoW Token, a new in-game item that allows players to simply and securely exchange gold and game time between each other.<br>
<br>
Players will be able to purchase a WoW Token through the in-game Shop for real money, and then sell it on the Auction House for gold at the current market price. When a player buys a WoW Token from the Auction House for gold, the Token becomes Soulbound, and the player can then redeem it for 30 days of game time.<br>

<br>
Want to buy a WoW Token for gold? Head to the new Game Time tab in the Auction House, and purchase one immediately for the current gold buyout price&#x2014;there&#x2019;s no bidding involved.<br>
<br>
When you put a WoW Token up for sale, you&#x2019;ll be quoted the amount of gold you&#x2019;ll receive once someone buys it&#x2014;you&#x2019;re guaranteed to get that amount no matter how the market moves.<br>
<br>
The WoW Token was created to give players with lots of extra gold the option to use it to help cover their subscription cost, and give those who want to purchase gold a way to do so from fellow players through a secure, easy-to-use system. The Token will be making its debut in an upcoming patch&#x2014;in the meantime, check out the FAQ below for details on how it works.<br>
<br>
FAQ<br>
<br>
THE BASICS<br>
<br>
Q: How do I buy a WoW Token for real money?<br>
A: WoW Tokens will be available for purchase for real money through the World of Warcraft in-game Shop. You can access the Shop through the row of feature buttons next to your character&#x2019;s bags.<br>
<br>
Q: I need gold! How do I sell a WoW Token to another player?<br>
A: You&#x2019;ll be able to sell WoW Tokens through a dedicated Token exchange in the Auction House, located in a new Game Time section. WoW Tokens cannot be traded or sold any other way.<br>
<br>
Q: How much gold will I receive when I sell a WoW Token?<br>
A: The gold value of a Token will be determined dynamically based on supply and demand. When you put a Token up for sale, you&#x2019;ll be quoted the amount of gold you&#x2019;ll receive upon a successful sale. If you then decide to place the Token up for sale, that amount is locked in, and the gold will be sent to your mailbox after another player purchases your Token.<br>
<br>
Q: I need game time! How do I buy a WoW Token from the Auction House?<br>
A: When you visit the Auction House, you&#x2019;ll be presented with the current market price for a WoW Token in your game region&#x2014;there&#x2019;s no bidding involved, and all Tokens in a game region are priced the same at any given moment. If you decide to purchase one, you&#x2019;ll receive it in your mailbox, and can then immediately redeem it for game time.<br>
<br>
Q: How much game time do I get by redeeming a WoW Token?<br>
A: You&#x2019;ll receive 30 days of game time when you redeem a WoW Token.<br>
<br>
Q: Can I resell a WoW Token after I&#x2019;ve purchased it for gold?<br>
A: No, each WoW Token can only be sold once. After you purchase a Token for gold, it becomes Soulbound. At that point, it can only be redeemed for game time.<br>
<br>
<br>
THE DETAILS<br>
<br>
Q: How much will a WoW Token cost on the Shop?<br>
A: Pricing details will be announced at a later date.<br>
<br>
Q: Why are you introducing the WoW Token feature?<br>
A: We&#x2019;ve heard feedback from players that they&#x2019;d be interested in a secure, legitimate way to acquire gold that doesn&#x2019;t involve the use of unauthorized third-party gold-selling services&#x2014;one of the primary sources of account compromises. We also know players who&#x2019;ve amassed large amounts of gold through regular play would be interested in the ability to trade some to other players in exchange for game time, helping cover their subscription costs. <br>
<br>
The WoW Token feature gives players on both sides of the equation a secure and straightforward way to make that exchange. It opens up a new kind of payment option for World of Warcraft players, and we hope that it will also help lead to fewer account compromises and a better game experience overall.<br>
<br>
Q: How is acquiring gold by selling a WoW Token different from buying gold from third-party services?<br>
A: Buying gold from third-party services negatively impacts the game experience for everyone. The overwhelming majority of the gold these services provide comes from stolen player accounts, halting the victims&#x2019; ability to play the game and contribute to their guilds. On top of this, gold selling companies often farm resources using hack programs, sell fake product codes as a scam, and spam entire realms with ads to buy gold, disrupting the game in very real ways.<br>
<br>
The WoW Token allows players to exchange real money for gold in a secure and sanctioned way&#x2014;together with the ongoing efforts of our developers, support staff, and anti-hack teams to stop the exploits these companies use and help players who have become victims of their operations, we hope the Token can help make World of Warcraft a safer and more enjoyable game for all of our players.<br>
<br>
Q: Why can&#x2019;t players set their own prices for the WoW Token?<br>
A: The WoW Token feature is designed to facilitate the exchange of gold and game time between players in as secure, convenient, and fair a way as possible, and without making players feel like they&#x2019;re playing a game with their hard-earned money. Having a set current market price and a straightforward exchange system is the best way to achieve that&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t need to worry about whether your Token will sell or not due to being undercut or the market shifting, and everyone receives exactly the amount of gold they were quoted.<br>
<br>
Q: What happens if the price quoted to me is different from what the Token actually sells for?<br>
A: You will always receive the gold amount quoted to you at the time you place a Token up for sale, regardless of what the current price is when the item actually sells.<br>
<br>
Q: How long should I expect to receive my gold after putting a Token up for sale? How does the game determine whose Token to sell?<br>
A: The amount of time it takes to receive your gold after putting a Token up for sale depends on a variety of factors, including the current supply and demand. When you list a Token, you&#x2019;ll be quoted an estimated time based on the current Token supply and the rate of recent transactions, but the actual amount of time it takes to sell is likely to vary (note that Tokens do not expire). In most cases, Tokens are sold in the order in which they were put up for sale; however, there are some exceptions to this, such as when a Token purchase is undergoing verification.<br>
<br>
Q: If I buy a WoW Token from the Auction House, how long does it take to receive the Token?<br>
A: Just like a standard Auction House purchase, it will normally arrive in your mailbox nearly instantaneously.<br>
<br>
Q: If I&#x2019;m buying a WoW Token for real money from the in-game Shop, how long does it take to receive it?<br>
A: Once you successfully complete a purchase, your Token should arrive in your inventory (or mailbox, if your inventory is full) almost immediately.<br>
<br>
Q: Do Tokens expire? What happens if I accidentally delete one?<br>
A: No, Tokens do not expire. They also can&#x2019;t be deleted, so no need to fear accidentally trashing them.<br>
<br>
Q: Can I stop my auction or receive a refund after it was purchased (for gold or real money)?<br>
A: All transactions are considered final and auctions cannot be cancelled, so make sure you&#x2019;re certain you want to proceed before listing or buying a Token. To help prevent unintentional transactions, you will be prompted to confirm your purchase or sale before it&#x2019;s finalized.<br>
<br>
Q: Is there a deposit? Does the Auction House take a cut of the Token seller&#x2019;s gold?<br>
A: There&#x2019;s no deposit, and the Auction House does not take a cut of the gold for WoW Token sales. The standard deposit is designed to dissuade players from spamming the auction house with items that aren&#x2019;t selling, and the standard cut is designed to dissuade players from buying and reselling items for minuscule markups. These issues don&#x2019;t apply to the WoW Token, so there&#x2019;s no need for a deposit or cut.<br>
<br>
Q: Will each game region have its own WoW Token exchange? Will everyone in a game region have access to it?<br>
A: Each game region&#x2014;Americas (including ANZ realms), Europe, Taiwan, Korea, and China&#x2014;will have its own shared WoW Token exchange. We&#x2019;ll share additional details at a later date.</div></div>
