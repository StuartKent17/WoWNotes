Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons<br>
Warlords of Draenor is adding Garrisons, which are WoW&apos;s version of Player Housing. Rather than decorating a house, you are able to build and upgrade a base, as well as collecting followers. Blizzard has previously shown off some Garrison artwork (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3753-Artcraft-Building-a-Garrison), as well as sharing some information at Blizzcon during the World of Warcraft: What&apos;s Next panel (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3523-World-of-Warcraft-What-s-Next) and the World of Warcraft Raids, Gameplay, Questing, and More panel (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3540-World-of-Warcraft-Raids-Gameplay-Questing-and-More).<br>

Garrison Levels<br>
Right now there are two different locations with plots in the files, one of which doesn&apos;t include the fishing hut.<br>
<br>
Level 1 - 2 Small Plots, 1 Medium Plot, 1 Large Plot, Mine, Farm, and Fishing Hut<br>

Buildings<br>
A garrison is made up of plots, which are filled by buildings.<br>
<br>
<br>
You can&apos;t have every building at once, as you are limited by the number of plots. <br>

There are buildings for almost every profession, which allow you to gather reagents daily and make some of that profession&apos;s items. <br>
The base level profession building only can hold one day&apos;s worth of reagents, so you have to collect them every day. As you upgrade, the building can hold two and then four days worth of reagent batches. <br>
Each building has specializations, which gives you some kind of perk, such as portals, more reagents, or buffs to followers.<br>
Each building sits on a different plot size, with Profession buildings requiring small plots. The Mine, Fishing Hut, Farm, and Pet Menagerie are listed as unique plot types.<br>

PvE<br>
Any indication of what a mythic roster looks like, role-wise? An inkling would sure help me go from 10-man to mythic.<br>
2-3 tanks (mostly 2), 4-6 healers (mostly 5), ~13 DPS. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/447399563318398976))<br>
<br>
I&apos;d say that an unwritten law is that if an encounter is designed for X healers, top guilds will X-1 heal at least<br>
It may be nearly unavoidable at the very cutting edge. It&apos;s a problem when people are still underhealing months later. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445578299587043328))<br>
When you&apos;re undergeared the first weeks, better to wipe 90% of the time to lacking heals than 100% of the time to lacking DPS (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445578450372268033))<br>
<br>
Do you consider the fact that most raids &apos;reset&apos; Dark Shamans so they spawn outside the room a design mistake?<br>
Not ideal; was a band-aid late in the PTR cycle for the fact that pulling them out to begin the pull was awkward. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/446013373436534784))<br>
<br>
WHY do you enable cross realm on heroic mode when there are still realm first on the table??<br>
Realm Firsts aren&apos;t removed by this. You still need a guild group to achieve a realm first. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446017700943241216))<br>
But 3 people can get to our server and help kill garrosh and the guild get the realm first?<br>
Yes, you could have 3 xrealm people help your 25man group kill Garrosh. That&apos;s still 22 players from the guild; they earn it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446018494811742208))<br>
In my opinion that&apos;s not fair at all I have been fighting to get to the top guild... to some random people come and take it away<br>
But that&apos;s the point; it wouldn&apos;t be some random people coming to take it away. They can&apos;t do that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446019596890279936))<br>
Some people (and we have proff) are selling us the kill of garrosh with our accounts. Ofcourse we didn&apos;t accept it...<br>
That&apos;s totally against our ToS, and we are staunchly against that. And, it&apos;s completely unrelated to this change. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446020821752893440))<br>
For a ToS clarification, what sort of kill/achievement sales go against it? (Obviously playing other accounts would).<br>
I believe can answer that. I was just immediately responding to the &quot;playing others&apos; accounts&quot; part, which is obvious (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446041078970327041))<br>
<br>
Any eta on when heroic/normal no longer shares a lockout. AKA can we do both a normal and a heroic run in the same week?<br>
The pre-Warlords patch 6.0. That&apos;s a much more fundamental change to how raids are structured. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/446073091655888896))<br>
<br>
Also, what would it do if the printed to file combat log saw EVERYTHING. Including things in other phases (like Norushen).<br>
Working on getting the combat log to do exactly that - couple of issues to sort out but nothing insurmountable. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/446870706786033664))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
did you ever test 4v4 arena games? I feel 5v5 is too much of a zerg fest, curious about how 4v4 would feel...<br>
2 healers 2 dps is not fun (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/446100497255002112))<br>
I was thinking of it as a 2heals+2dps and 1heal+3dps mix, kinda like 2s with heal+dps and double dps...<br>
We could always enforce role compositions but that feels very heavy handed. Better when a meta emerges. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/446125002090221568))<br>
<br>
Any plans on allowing Vicious Skeletal Warhorse (and other Vicious Saddle mounts) account-wide ?<br>
Nope. They are character bound to encourage repeat accomplishment. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/446210597458169856))<br>
<br>
do you think removing 2v2 could improve pool and focus of arenas more?<br>
tricky question. I think it would improve 3v3 participation but reduce arena participation overall. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/446477201349681152))<br>
<br>
Any chance to make cross-spec gearing for Hybrids easier? Currently you&apos;re stuck with one spec until the near end of season.<br>
In warlords, the primary stat on gear changes based in your spec. Lots of info out there about it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/446683865969463296))<br>

Heartbleed Account Security Notice<br>
Many news sites are reporting a vulnerability (dubbed the Heartbleed bug) discovered in OpenSSL, an encryption technology used by a majority of websites and online services&#x2014;including banks, email providers, and social media sites&#x2014;to protect sensitive data as it&#x2019;s transmitted from users to web services.<br>
<br>
We want to emphasize that Battle.net&#x2019;s encryption was not affected by this vulnerability. However, if you use the same password on Battle.net that you use elsewhere, your Battle.net account could be at risk if those sites were affected by this bug.<br>
If the above situation applies to you, we recommend changing your Battle.net password to a new, unique password. As always, we recommend that you maintain separate login credentials for each online service you use. Using the same email or password across multiple services greatly increases the potential impact of any compromise.<br>
<br>
More information about the Heartbleed vulnerability can be found at http://heartbleed.com, and you can find additional information on how to protect your Battle.net accounts at http://www.battle.net/security.<br>
