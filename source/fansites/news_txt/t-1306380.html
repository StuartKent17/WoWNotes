Darkmoon Faire Cross-Realm Zone<br>
Honestly I kinda like the CRZ&apos;d DMF. I think bustling and crowded is the expected state of any worthwhile carnival.<br>
Yeah, and that&apos;s the intent behind CRZ as a whole. The Darkmoon Faire being CRZ&apos;d is intentional, the problem is it&apos;s just allowing too many people into the same cross-realm instance right now and causing some overcrowding issues. Much of the intent of cross-realm zones is providing the experience of a lively massively-multiplayer environment, even for lower level zones where players don&apos;t tend to congregate as much any more. We certainly want the Darkmoon Faire to always feel like you&apos;re visiting a mystical carnival full of excited patrons.<br>
<br>
We&apos;ve developed a fix and that will be implemented with Tuesday morning&apos;s rolling restarts. Let us know what you think afterward, and we&apos;ll be closely monitoring the changes as well.<br>

Patch 5.4 Legendary Item<br>
The furthest anyone has gotten is to receive the 600 ilvl cloak that was implemented this patch (I believe?). The actually weapon, I&apos;m assuming, won&apos;t come out until 5.4.<br>
You&apos;re certain it&apos;s a weapon? ;) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/262003-has-anyone-actually-finished-the-legendary/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9234983487?page=1#15))<br>

Conquest Catch Up System<br>
After looking into the reported issues with catch-up caps not being appropriate I wanted to clarify on a few points.<br>
<br>
(Week of season x 1000) - Total Conquest Points earned this season = Conquest cap <br>
<br>
This calculation is not actually 100% correct and does leave some room for interpretation. To clarify on the formula and to ensure that you are all aware of how your Conquest cap should be calculated:<br>
<br>
(Week of season - 1) * 1000 &#x2013; Conquest points earned this season + Cap received from your current rating = Weekly cap<br>
<br>
As you can see, your cap from rating should be added on top of the catch-up cap and the first week of the season is not included in the calculation, I have corrected my previous posts to reflect this. The reason that the calculation is actually uses &quot;Week of season - 1&quot; is because if we included the first week then we&#x2019;d basically be giving players an extra 1000 points in the first week. The goal of this system is to give players who haven&#x2019;t been maxing their conquest a way to catch up, not to give everyone an additional boost in the first week.<br>
<br>
In addition to this, some of you have stated that you noticed some of your catch up cap disappearing mysteriously, try doing the calculation again with the new formula provided above. If you are still missing some of your catch up cap, can you provide some additional information to help us with looking into this matter such as; your current Conquest point cap and the amount of points that you have earned so far this season.
