Raid Testing Schedule - October 11th - 18th<br>
On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, October 11th-13th we will be conducting raid tests of Antorus, the Burning Throne. If testing goes well, the majority of Normal mode will remain available over the weekend.<br>
<br>
Thursday, October 12th<br>
<br>
Kin&apos;garoth - Mythic Antorus, the Burning Throne<br>
13:00 PDT (16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST)<br>
<br>
The Coven of Shivarra - Mythic Antorus, the Burning Throne<br>
14:00 PDT (17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST)<br>
<br>
Friday, October 13th<br>
<br>
Antoran High Command - Heroic Antorus, the Burning Throne<br>
13:00 PDT (16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST)<br>
<br>
Argus the Unmaker - Heroic Antorus, the Burning Throne<br>
14:00 PDT (17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST)<br>
<br>
Friday, October 13th - Wednesday, October 18th<br>
Normal Antorus, the Burning Throne<br>
<br>
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br>
<br>
Q: How do I get into the raid zone?<br>
<br>
A: In Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade Sr. in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. (The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.)<br>
<br>
I assume are all normal bosses up Friday, October 13th - Wednesday, October 18th? Including argus?<br>
Argus the Unmaker will not be included in the Normal mode test. All other bosses will be available.<br>
<br>
<br>
Patch 7.3 Hotfixes - October 10<br>
Argus<br>

Fixed an issue where bonus rolls would fail to occur when defeating some Greater Invasion Point bosses.<br>

Artifact Appearances After Legion<br>
I just posted this in another thread, but I&apos;ll mention it again here:<br>
<br>
Any artifact appearances you&apos;ve unlocked (including Druid forms) will be available as transmogrification options after Legion. I&apos;m not privy to the specifics on how it will work regarding Druid forms, but the developers are keen to make sure you can still use those forms after Legion.<br>
<br>
You&apos;ll also still be able to acquire appearances you haven&apos;t earned post-Legion, with the only exceptions being the Mythic 15 Keystone Dungeon appearance, and the Mage Tower appearances. If you don&apos;t earn those before the end of Legion, you won&apos;t be able to earn them after Legion - think of them as effectively the Challenge Mode sets of Legion.<br>
<br>
Hope this clarifies.<br>
<br>
only to make sure: when legion ends we can use our artifact skins as transmog weapons, but only for the class? i mean i cant use thunderfury on another class am i right?<br>
Right now I believe the current intent is that artifact weapon appearances can only be transmogged on the class the artifact was for. So to use an earlier example, Death Knight&apos;s wouldn&apos;t be able to transmog the Corrupted Ashbringer appearance from a Paladin.<br>
<br>
I&apos;ve forwarded on the other questions in this thread so if I get any more specific details I can share, I&apos;ll let you know.<br>
<br>
Morning! I&apos;ve got a few updates to share.<br>
<br>
Regarding the Mage Tower appearance. If you unlock your Mage Tower appearance before Legion is over, you will still be able to earn the colour variants of it post-Legion.<br>
<br>
Likewise the colour variants of the Balance of Power appearance will still be obtainable post-Legion, with the exception of the Mythic +15 variant which needs to be obtained before Legion ends.<br>
<br>
Prestige appearances will still be obtainable after Legion, though the exact manner in which they are earned may change. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1074188-will-we-keep-artifact-looks/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17617013933?page=2#32))<br>

Retribution Paladin Balance<br>
Retribution Paladins are nowhere near the bottom, and, like others have pointed out, that data is misleading considering there are quite a few bosses that allow us to cleave. <br>
<br>
Currently I still see that if I have more than one target I know Divine Storm overpowers Templar&apos;s Verdict and I&apos;m free to cleave like a madman. Retribution Paladins shine on movement and cleave which ToS is definitely a lot more friendly to us. <br>
<br>
Of course I wouldn&apos;t object to buffs(who wouldn&apos;t) but I don&apos;t feel like we need them at the moment. This could change with our T21 set bonuses considering we&apos;d be losing the T20 4 set that interacts so well with our talents and Crusade, however in the current state I think Ret Paladins are quite fine and pretty formidable among melee.<br>
<br>
I can&apos;t say I agree with you here. Movement is quite punishing for Ret outside of Steed. Divine Steed off GCD would be amazing right now.<br>
True, Divine Steed coming off GCD would be nice change. However, having the option to switch to Cavalier I feel fills that need for me when I do want the additional mobility. Cavalier plus our Blessings fills any need of mobility I&apos;ve encountered this tier. <br>
<br>
With the T20 4p going away some buffs would be nice. The 4p even feels like it&apos;s made to be baseline since it makes the spec feel much more fluid. Spending that one extra GCD is annoying when you need aoe. I would like to see T21 changed though.<br>
I agree here as well. I&apos;ve become very used to the T20 four-piece and it feels very baseline to me at this point. It&apos;s going to take some getting used to for me moving away from it if that isn&apos;t changed to a baseline.
