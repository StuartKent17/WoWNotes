Boubouille2007-06-30, 04:03 PMThe Attunement page http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=25 is now updated with the Black Temple attunement.

I also created all the boss pages in the left menu, only the loot tables are available for the moment, some items are missing when they're not available on wowhead mostly, it will be fixed asap. I'll list the movie ... well, soon.
