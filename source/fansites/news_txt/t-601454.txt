Boubouille2007-06-30, 04:03 PMThe Attunement page  is now updated with the Black Temple attunement.

I also created all the boss pages in the left menu, only the loot tables are available for the moment, some items are missing when they're not available on wowhead mostly, it will be fixed asap. I'll list the movie ... well, soon. 



<table border="0">
<tr>
<td width="285" valign="top" align="left">
The Black Temple


Illidan 
Illidari Council 
Mother Shahraz 
Reliquary of Souls 
Teron Gorefiend 
Gurtogg Bloodboil 
Shade of Akama 
Supremus 
High Warlord Naj'entus 


<td width="285" valign="top" align="left">
Hyjal Summit


Archimonde 
Azgalor 
Kaz'rogal 
Anetheron 
Rage Winterchill 

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Menu also include both instance maps, the Black Temple medium resolution map is used, if you want to get the other resolutions they're still here and I probably won't link them anymore, save the URL somewhere :
3000x2000 
2000x1300 
1500x1000
