Yesterday, I stated that all quests rewards have been increased from 75 to 250 reputations, I was wrong. Actually the longest quest, Rampaging Giants , has been increased to 350 reputation instead of 75, that's a 466% increase. 


 


2.3 patch available on the Background Downloader
This doesn't mean anything, remember that we had to wait weeks between the first download of the 2.2 patch and the release on live servers. 
It's the background downloader prepping for 2.3 much like we've done before. It just means we're getting closer.

 


Utgarde Keep Preview
A preview of the Utgarde Keep has been posted on the official site, nothing really new about the dungeon itself but there are a few interesting details and artworks.

Interface
In 2.3 chat channels are rate limited on the client in the same way whispers are now. Each chat channel is limited separately, at a rate of 10 messages in 10 seconds. This means that you can send one message every second without ever seeing delays, or a burst of 10 messages every 10 seconds without seeing delays. Messages that exceed this rate are not dropped, but simply delayed in order until they can be sent. This does not affect SendAddonMessage or party/raid/guild chat. Source 



Items
There is a possibility of adding more space to characters in the future, but there isn't any finalized decisions on this. Source] 
It's just too early to say if [item=29434] will be used in Wrath of the Lich King.



Wrath of the Lich King
There isn't any details on a WotLK Collector's Edition, it's still unsure if one will exist. Source]
