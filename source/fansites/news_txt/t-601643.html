<br>
BlizzCon attendees are now able to copy up to four level 70 characters to an event realm. Attendees will have the chance to experience new content at the event using their own level 70 characters or a pre-made character. Those wishing to make copies may do so at the character copy page (http://www.blizzard.com/blizzcon07/faq-ccopy.shtml), which will be available until the end of BlizzCon on August 4, 2007.<br>
