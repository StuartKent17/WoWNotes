Classes, systems, spreadsheets, the occasional obscure questline... These have been the primary focus of my life for years now. I cannot thank the WoW community enough, for your passion, your friendship, the laughs, the excitement, for being able to do something I love.

It has been an honor. But the time has come for me to adventure elsewhere within Azeroth, and tackle a different challenge... Cards! I'll see you soon, Hearthstone fans!
