Model changes in 2.3
I never posted about it because there aren't many of them, but a few models have been changed in 2.3. A few armors have been recolored to match item sets, and two weapons have been changed. First, the [item=32369] now looks like Mother Shahraz weapons. Now, the big nerf, one of the most used weapons have been changed ... the [item=3335] has been reverted to its old skin ! Sorry.
