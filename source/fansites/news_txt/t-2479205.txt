Rise of Azshara PTR Progress
A few minutes ago, we made the Rise of Azshara PTR available for download and install. This is so that initial testers will be completely ready to log in when the test realms are made public.

We are not at that point yet, and we don’t know how long it’s going to take to complete our checks and configuration. It looks like at least a few hours.

We’ll post here confirming when the PTR is playable and the PTR discussion subforums are open.


Patch 8.1.5 Hotfixes - April 16, 2019

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Brewmaster

Fixed an issue that caused Stagger to mitigate more damage than intended from environmental sources.


 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Protection

Fixed an issue that caused Holy Shield to mitigate more damage than intended from environmental sources.




Dungeons and Raids

Battle for Dazar'alor

Jaina

Howling Winds duration increased to 10 minutes was 2 minutes on all difficulties.
Gathering Blizzard's progress is now reset at the start of the second intermission on Mythic difficulty.
Ice Block health lowered by 25% on Mythic difficulty.
Shattering Lance charge up time increased to 9 seconds was 8 seconds on Mythic difficulty.
Jaina will now always teleport to a predictable location during the first intermission on Mythic difficulty.

Stormwall Blockade

Tempting Sirens’s base health has been reduced on Normal and Heroic difficulties.



Blackwing Lair

Chromaggus will once again drop the following items: Claw of Chromaggus, Ashjre'thul, Crossbow of Smiting, Elementium Threaded Cloak, Primalist's Linked Waistguard, Taut Dragonhide Gloves, Shimmering Geta, and Girdle of the Fallen Crusader.


Dire Maul

Fixed a bug that prevented players from looting the Gordok Tribute chest in Dire Maul.


The MOTHERLODE!!

Mogul Razdunk

Drill Smash no longer hits pets or guardians and does not remove stacks of Configuration: Drill if any are within the area of impact.




Items

Heart of Azeroth

Fixed an issue that caused Meticulous Scheming to trigger less frequently than intended.



Player versus Player

Resolved an issue that prevented the intended 50% reduction to Azerite Traits in PvP from being applied to Traits found on Engineering helms.
The effectiveness of Ward of Envelopment  and Mirror of Entwined Fate  in PvP has been reduced by 50% for player characters who are not in a healing specialization.
The effectiveness of Diamond-Laced Refracting Prism  in PvP has been reduced by 50% for player characters who are not in a tank specialization.

Developers’ notes: The above trinkets are balanced for healers and tanks in PvP, and their current tuning slows down the pacing of Arena combat unacceptably when used by nonstandard roles. Reducing their effectiveness in PvP, for those roles only, will allow them to remain a formidable option.



Quests

Fixed a bug that prevented players from completing “No One Left Behind” if Rokhan did not spawn.
