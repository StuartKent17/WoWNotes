Upcoming Class Tuning Changes
Giving everyone a heads up on class balance changes that could potentially take effect as early as later tonight. Many of these changes may not be reflected in tooltips.

These changes are primarily aimed at level 100 balance, but they will have reasonable effects in the meantime as well. Please keep the comments constructive, and we expect to be making a few additional tuning changes in the future.

I think this is a misspeling, you guys buffed this crap right? 2k damage for a 2s cast get reduced?
This change undid the buff to Frostbolt back on October 17. The net change is zero.

So you're saying the tuning team really don't have a clue what they're doing?
Or, we made a change and undid it because it isn't working out. Note that the tuning is primarily intended for level 100.


Upcoming Honor Changes
Wanted to give a heads-up that there's a hotfix being worked on no ETA but soon without the TM to increase the amount of Honor gains for Arathi Basin, Deepwind Gorge, Eye of the Storm, and The Battle for Gilneas. We're changing it so Honor is awarded for every 150 resources gathered up from Honor awarding for every 250 resources gathered.


Characters of Warcraft Updated: Velen and Khadgar
The Lore section of our game guide has been updated with two new entries on the Characters of Warcraft page http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/characters/: Velen http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/characters/velen and Khadgar http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/characters/khadgar!

Velen is a staunch defender of the Draenei, and has guided his people in the struggle against the Burning Legion for thousands of years. Now he’s facing a much more immediate threat – the Iron Horde.

Khadgar saw the Iron Horde’s intentions for Azeroth when Nethergarde Keep fell. Now he is determined to stop their assault before it’s too late, and is leading the charge into the Dark Portal, as he did in the past.

Their fates intertwined, Velen and Khadgar are willing to sacrifice much to ensure the safety of their people. Can they triumph over the Iron Horde? Or will they fall to a foe more dangerous than any they’ve encountered before?

We invite you to learn more about these characters and the pivotal role they play in Warlords of Draenor.

To learn more about the leaders of the Iron Horde, check out the Lords of War video series http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/savage-world/lords-of-war/.
