Raid Testing Schedule - April 15-18<br>
On Friday, April 15, and Monday, April 18, we will continue our Legion Alpha raid testing.<br>
<br>
Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Mythic, of course, requires 20 and does not scale.<br>
<br>
There are a couple of bugs active in the current build - the obvious phasing issue, and an issue that causes many player abilities (and some boss abilities) to not properly consume resources. We have a hotfix in flight for the second issue as I write this; the phasing issue is under investigation, but shouldn&apos;t impact raid tests. Of course, should anything change on that front, we&apos;ll update our testing plans accordingly.<br>
<br>
Friday, April 15<br>
<br>

13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br>
<br>
Chronomatic Anomaly - Heroic Nighthold<br>

<br>

<br>
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of an alpha environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br>

Discipline Priest Feedback -- Build 21466 -- 13-Apr<br>
You guys have pretty much figured it out, but, right--the passive damage increase on the artifact should not increase Atonement healing. The traits on the artifact itself should ultimately increase Disc&apos;s total healing ability (including both Atonement and non-Atonement) by the same amount as the other healers&apos; artifacts. We do want to figure out how to make this clearer.<br>
<br>
Disc should be able get use out of DPS trinkets, but we have to make sure they&apos;re not overpowered. For example, they have to add less healing than healing trinkets. Corrupted Starlight as the twin problems of being AoE (which will always risk being overpowered for Atonement purposes) and being an RPPM proc (which results in it adding the same amount of DPS to Disc&apos;s low damage as it does to a caster&apos;s high damage). We will likely reduce RPPM proc rates for Disc on trinkets like this.

Destruction Warlock Feedback -- Build 21466 -- 13-Apr<br>
Is Chaos Barrage intended to be a portal that is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the other two portals?<br>
These are still subject to tuning; however, they will likely have some variance in how much damage they do (among other reasons, due to the different durations).
