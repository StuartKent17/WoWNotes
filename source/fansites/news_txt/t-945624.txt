Boubouille2011-07-27, 02:41 AMUpdate - Paragon released their video of the Ragnaros 25-Man Heroic World First Kill http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owI0MSopcs0&feature=channel_video_title. But I'll probably embed it tomorrow because people never read those updates anyway.

Patch 4.2 Hotfixes - July 26
Blizzard posted the list of the hotfixes deployed yesterday, including the nerfs to Firelands raid bosses and a couple of classes changes.
July 26

General

Characters should no longer receive errors or potential disconnects when using Levitate, Slow Fall, or the Parachute Cloak while falling.
All combat and vanity pets should now respawn normally after players use any flight path.


Classes

Combustion should no longer ignore damage modifiers on a target. As an example, Smoldering Elemental packs in the Firelands should no longer take full damage from Impact’s spread of Combustion, despite these creatures having damage reduction modifiers.

Shamanism Elemental passive now causes Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, and Lava Burst spells to gain an additional 32% benefit from the shaman’s spell power, up from 20%.

Deep Wounds should no longer ignore damage modifiers on a target. As an example, Smoldering Elementals in the Firelands should no longer take full damage from Deep Wounds, despite these creatures having damage reduction modifiers.


Dungeons & Raids

Players who die and release before a boss is killed should now receive Valor and Justice points. However, players that release at the moment the boss dies and are currently at the loading screen will become locked to the dungeon, but will not receive any currency for the kill. We’re working to address this in a future update.


Firelands

Alysrazor

Alysrazor cannot dodge or parry attacks from players.
Alysrazor’s melee evasion angle has been adjusted so that players have a larger area to use abilities which require that they be behind their target.
Blazing Talon Clawshapers will now properly aggro a new target when threat is dropped.
On Heroic difficulty, Brushfires will despawn once Firestorm is cast, and since the Initiates shield themselves during firestorm, none are cast again until it ends.
Molten Feather is removed once Alysrazor ignites at 50 energy, as opposed to when she burns out.

Baleroc

On 25-player Heroic difficulty, Torment now grants a stack of Vital Spark per 5 applications, up from 3. To compensate, Baleroc’s health has been reduced on 25-player Heroic difficulty.

Beth’tilac

Attacking the Fire Hawk flock along the way to Beth'tilac will not cause the Hell Hound pack to aggro as well.

Majordomo Fandral Staghelm

Fandral’s health has been reduced on 25-player Heroic difficulty.
Damage suffered from a shaman's Spirit Link totem will no longer break player Concentration.
Player pets should now benefit from their master's Concentration.
Fandral now gains energy when his Flame Scythe hits fewer than 7 targets. The amount gained increases as fewer targets are hit.



The Occulus

Wiping to Mage-Lord Urom in any phase of the encounter no longer causes players to be unable to use their Dragon Essences to mount drakes.


Items

The Moonwell Chalice is now on a shared cooldown with other on-use trinkets.
The Moonwell Phial is now on a shared cooldown with other on-use trinkets.


Professions

Crafted Bloodthirsty bind-on-equip relics and cloaks are no longer unique, allowing players to craft and hold more than one of the same item type in their inventories.


PvP
Battlegrounds

Eye of the Storm has been temporarily removed from the Rated Battlegrounds options.


Quests & Creatures
Eastern Plaguelands

Beezil Linkspanner's gossip option should now always be available if players have completed the quest Onward to Light's Hope Chapel, allowing players who have not already done so the ability to complete the achievement Full Caravan.


Hyjal Regrowth & Molten Front

Players should now be able to accept the quest Unlocking the Secrets Within from Rabine Saturna after turning in A Smoke-Stained Locket.
Players who are Hated or Hostile with the Steamwheedle Cartel faction can still turn in the quest Well Armed to Ricket.
The creature abilities Smoldering Roots and Blazing Stomp no longer affect pets the unexpected launch of player pets no longer occurs.
