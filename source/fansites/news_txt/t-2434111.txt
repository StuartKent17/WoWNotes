Blue Posts
Rextroy Ban Reverted
As a reminder, posting about account actions is generally not allowed on the forums and it is not a means to appeal or resolve issues. This was resolved privately between this player and us after the video he posted this morning.

Just pulling back the curtain a little here but long story short, this was a mistake on our end. This player actually has a great history of reporting issues with us that they've found, and they wait for us to verify it's fixed before they put the videos up. This was a case of not everyone internally knowing this was happening and that the exploits he showcased were fixed, before the videos were posted. 

The videos being posted are an example of great bug reporting in how detailed they are in showing how exactly to reproduce an issue. This is something Ion hit on in the last Q&A where he talked about the Quality Assurance team and how they have to reproduce issues that players report to us. Sometimes reports aren't detailed enough and it makes it a little harder to figure out some issues.

I just want to end this by plugging the correct channels to report bugs in. 

To report a bug in-game:
Click Help to open the Customer Support window.
Click Submit Bug.
Enter the details of the bug, making sure to follow the guidelines outlined on the submission form.
Click Submit.

You can also report bugs over in the Bug Reporting Forum here:

If you'd like to report something like an exploit and not advertise it, a way you can report that it is here:

Azerite Trait Tuning - September 25
I've updated the OP here to better reflect what actually changed on Sharpened Blades:

https://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue

Assassination Sharpened Blades: The benefit of having multiple copies of this trait active is reduced. Subtlety Sharpened Blades: damage reduced by 30% unchanged in PvP.

Island Expedition Reward Sources
A recent Reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9ipj6l/islands_are_the_best_content_system_released_in/ highlighted a theory that users such have been talking about on the forum for a while. 

The theory is that Island Expedition rewards are tied to killing specific named or types of NPCs on the island. For example, killing Mogu would give you a chance to win Pandaria transmog. Keep in mind that this is just a theory and isn't confirmed.
