Feedback: Epic Battlegrounds<br>
We&#x2019;re working on some hotfixes to Epic Battlegrounds. These changes are not yet live, but should be ready for the game in the next few days.<br>
<br>
Alterac Valley<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re modifying the scaling in the zone to make creatures more difficult for players at high item-levels. Our goal here is to make gameplay feel more similar to the difficulty of Alterac Valley in early Tides of Vengeance.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isle of Conquest<br>
<br>
The health of destructible walls will be increased by 30%. This is intended to offset the power that the docks has given players with recent 8.1.5 improvements.<br>
<br>
<br>
Battle for Wintergrasp<br>
<br>
The damage done by the Catapult&#x2019;s Flame Breath ability will be reduced. We still want Flame Breath to feel scary and powerful, especially against other players, but we feel that current values are too high.<br>
<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ve been monitoring Wintergrasp closely, and have been pleased to find that win rates for defense and offense are quite even, with a less-than-5% advantage for defenders. The change above to Catapult could have an impact on that, so we&#x2019;re holding back on making further changes until we see how this one goes.<br>
<br>
We have some other improvements to Epic Battlegrounds, including a new UI to track Lokholar and Ivus turn-in progress, that we&#x2019;re bringing to the game in the Rize of Azshara content update.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your continued feedback on Epic Battlegrounds. We really appreciate it.</div></div>
