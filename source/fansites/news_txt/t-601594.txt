If you are a World of Warcraft player, you have an exclusive opportunity to use a pre-made character OR your own level 68-70 characters to try out new World of Warcraft content at BlizzCon. You have the option to copy up to four level 68-70 characters to a special event realm to experience this content, which has not yet been seen on test realms.

I'd say Zul'aman, unanounced-yet dungeon coming after Zul'aman, or expansion ... Or dancing contest with murloc suits.
