Patch 6.1 - Mystic Runesaber Mount<br>
Patch 6.1 adds the Mystic Runesaber (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/180545-mystic-runesaber) mount, purchased from the in-game shop. Currently the mount is classified as a ground only mount, which would make it the only purchased mount to be ground only. However, the mount has flying animations and wings, so keep in mind that the content on the PTR can always change!<br>

Blackrock Foundry Frustration<br>
Looking into the data, we&apos;ve found that the direct damage from Gruul&apos;s Inferno Slice in particular was scaling up slightly slower than raid size, when usually our &quot;meteor damage&quot; abilities scale in direct proportion to raid size. As a result, assuming a similar percentage of the total raid splitting the Inferno Slice, it was inflicting more damage per player in smaller raid sizes. We have a hotfix in the works for this issue (keeping the damage unchanged for large raid groups, reducing it for smaller ones), which will likely take effect tomorrow. Thanks for the feedback, which helped direct our attention to this problem.

PTR Build Deployment - 2/6/15<br>
Yea, LOTS of dungeons are broken, I reported a few and they haven&apos;t been fixed yet. I think all dungeon boss chests are broken aswell. So many items are currently unobtainable on the ptr, really hope that doesn&apos;t go live.<br>
Definitely on our radar. It&apos;s not all chests, but it&apos;s quite a handful of the &quot;legacy&apos; content chests. Very odd.<br>
<br>
Hey Zor, can you toss out an update please, possibly an ETA or maybe what the new build will consist of?<br>
We&apos;re pretty much in the polish phase of builds - these types of builds are there to fix bugs, reduce crashes, improve stability. That kind of thing. Hoping to have realms up within the next couple of hours.<br>
<br>
Windows 8.1<br>
Thanks for the info, we&apos;ll take a look. An important part of these builds is using client crashes from you folks, adding fixes, and pushing out new builds that hopefully resolve these crashes. So with that in mind, please send error reports when a crash happens, and do your best to provide information in the comment section.<br>
<br>
You guys do a great job of sending in bug reports and feedback, but crash reports are vitally important as well. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/360957-ptr-build-deployment-2-6-15/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16202921319?page=2#30))<br>

Classes<br>
Do you guys regret hiding passives? Seeing a lot of confusion in-game pertaining to it. Seems less confusing to put them back.<br>
Do they have specific examples? (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/560916306854023168))<br>
<br>
Offensive dispels seem to be way too crippling against certain classes, is blizzard aware or concerned about this mechanic?<br>
Many classes have strong counters to other classes. We think that&apos;s an important part of classes feeling different. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/560916508583284736))<br>

Frostjaw is currently sharing DR with ROOTS AND SILENCES while it&apos;s supposed to share only with silences, bug or intended?<br>
This is intentional as it both roots and silences the target. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/560916611255644160))<br>

why can&#x2019;t i use glyph of cheetah and glyph of travel at the same time? cheetah&#x2019;s are SUPPOSED to be fast! wouldn&#x2019;t affect play<br>
That combo would be fine, but both have to be exclusive with GoStag. Current exclusive glyph design doesn&apos;t support that. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/560241537011830784))<br>

Are you satisified with the way crane stance works for MW monks? no fluidity at all to switch between stance, ReM is mandatory<br>
Yes, MW stances are intentionally quite modal and not intended to be frequently swapped. ReM isn&apos;t needed for Fistweaving. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/560241553692569600))<br>

If the Saving Grace change was meant to be a buff, it wasn&apos;t. Pretty big nerf to the only ability we could use to top someone.<br>
We would love to hear feedback about the current tuning of Saving Grace. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/560678887932178433))<br>

I assume Ghost Wolf doesn&apos;t keep Pepe still. <br>

Character / Items<br>
Felsoul Wand. Is there a reason it cannot be disenchanted or sold?<br>
We&apos;re addressing this issue in Patch 6.1, and thank you for the heads up! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/560237099912146944))<br>
<br>
Will the inscription offhand also no longer count toward crafted limit, as the shields will not?<br>
Thank you for this. You bring up a fair point so we&apos;ll discuss the possibility. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/560237650343235584))<br>

Panda isle has no mailbox. Makes rerolling for tweaks VERY difficult due to Brianni&apos;s hat that&apos;s mailed to every new alt.<br>
Frustration understandable, Redwood. Currently, we don&apos;t support mail going to characters until they&apos;ve chosen a faction. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/560242734854729729))<br>

PvP<br>
Will the 100 games won achieve for the mount ever be changed please ? Not everyone plays 3&apos;s or does rbg 2&apos;s with more win maybe<br>
Unlikely as those achievements/mounts were specifically designed to increase participation in 3s and RBGs. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/560916841770401792))<br>
