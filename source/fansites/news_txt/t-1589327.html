Character copies don&apos;t work yet (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/337800-602-ptr-testing-has-begun/#post28), but you can use a template.<br>
We&apos;re in the process pushing the latest 6.0.2 PTR Build to the Battle.net app. You should be able to install the 6.0.2 PTR via the Battle.net app shortly.<br>
<br>
As a reminder, the Battle.net app is mandatory in order to play WoW, and all updating/installing will now go through it. If you don&apos;t have the Battle.net app, get it here! http://us.battle.net/en/app/<br>
<br>
If you have an older version of the PTR build, you may need to uninstall it if your version doesn&apos;t automatically update. In order to install the PTR, make sure the Region/Account dropdown box is set to PTR: Mists of Pandaria. Example Picture<br>
<br>
More troubleshooting steps can be found in this support article.<br>
<br>
Key things to note with this build:<br>
<br>
Build version is version 6.0.2. 18838. The Mac Version of the PTR client is not working quite yet. We hope to have it working in the near future, but I do not have an ETA at this time. Character Copy is currently down on the PTR. When we bring it up, it&apos;ll be via the new in-game option, found on the Character Selection screen. There is currently a known crash that occurs when changing to/from Windowed Mode while in game, or changing the Resolution in-game. We&apos;re working to fix that, although it may require a new build.<br>
<br>
<br>
As in previous PTR tests for the Expansion Patches, this PTR will mimic what your live retail servers will look like on 6.0.2 Patch day (as opposed to the expansion launch date of Novemeber 13th).<br>
<br>
This means that some restrictions will be in place compared to our Beta Realms:<br>
<br>
Level Cap remains at level 90. Tanaan Jungle, Ashran, and the other Draenor zones will not be accessible. Garrisons, new dungeons, and new raids will not be accessible.<br>
<br>

Blasted Lands Quests<br>
The screenshots and footage below are from the beta version of the event, which is very similar to the version currently on the PTR. The second video includes the new cinematic added on the PTR. <br>

Thrall (http://wowpedia.org/Thrall), Khadgar (http://wowpedia.org/Khadgar), Vindicator Maraad (http://wowpedia.org/Vindicator_Maraad), and other NPCs have set up small camps near the Dark Portal with a short quest line of standard kill, collect, and interact objectives.<br>

Turning in the final quest to gives you The Iron Invasion (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/9618-the-iron-invasion) achievement, the of the Iron Vanguard title, and Iron Starlette (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/111660-iron-starlette).<br>
