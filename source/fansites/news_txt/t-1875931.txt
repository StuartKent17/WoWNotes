Crithto Leaves Blizzard
We're sorry to see Crithto http://wow.gamepedia.com/Crithto_%28CM%29 leave and wish him the best in the future! 
When my best friend suggested I try to get a job at Blizzard in late 2007, I stopped what I was doing in game, alt-tabbed to my web browser, and checked out the job listings. Sure enough, Game Master positions were open and I thought, what the heck? It wasn’t long before the Community Team accepted me into their ranks, and it’s made all the difference. Fast-forward to today, and I still cannot believe how my life has changed, how I’ve grown as a professional and a person by being a member of the Blizzard family. From my first BlizzCon in 2008, to the orc statue being installed on campus, from the Crithto NPC being added to the game, to seeing the Warcraft film go from being a dream to a reality, my time here has certainly been extremely meaningful. 

What is probably the most difficult decision I’ve ever had to make was to choose to move on to a new opportunity that was recently offered to me. I’ll get to face new challenges and really push my skills as a relationship builder and communicator, but none of this would be possible if it weren’t for my time and experience here at Blizzard. Candidly speaking, the day before I let my managers know I had decided to leave, I cried . . . a lot more than I should probably admit, but I did.

Blizzard’s games, my teammates, co-workers, and everything about being here and a part of this incredible community for these many years have meant so much to me, I can barely give these genuine emotions enough justice through written words. In a recent email to a close friend, I explained that Blizzard has felt like a “home” to me in the truest sense of the word. And the timing sure made my decision all the more difficult, too, given that my last day will be tomorrow October 8 and I won’t be able to see some of you at BlizzCon as a Blizzard employee though I do hope to attend.

I can’t thank all of you enough for your love and support, the weird pug pictures you’ve sent me on Twitter, and for your genuine passion for this game and all things Blizzard. I may be stepping down as “Crithto”, but I will always remain a fellow gamer, and I’m sure we’ll cross paths at some point again in the near future. /Respect, /Hug, /Farewell!
