Warlords of Draenor - Post-Squish Legacy Content
I should have phrased my initial posts better. The intent certainly wasn't a blanket dismissal of concerns about new difficulties with soloing content that you can handle easily in 5.4.

Right now, there is a known bug for which we should have a fix in an upcoming build that is causing raid bosses especially in Cataclysm content to be more challenging for level 90 players than is the intent. There are also specific issues with encounters that we're still hand-adjusting Gunship in Icecrown, notably. That will get sorted out. The overwhelming majority of players shouldn't see any negative impact to their legacy content experience when they go from 5.4 to 6.0.

The sole exception here, which is what I was clarifying, is that if there's an encounter that you can just barely solo as a tank spec on live today, it's quite possible that you won't quite be able to do so in 6.0. It's also possible that something you can solo comfortably today might be slightly harder in 6.0, but still doable. But that's because of basic changes to self-healing and the potency of tank cooldowns, and not anything related to our item or stat changes. And in any case, I'm talking about smaller differences here, not something like getting destroyed by Morchok when you can solo him easily on live, which is the result of a bug.

Keep it civil please. Weapon size is a subjective preference. A change would upset some, please others. holinka 
Either way, I'm not aware of any plans to change them. holinka 

Garrisons
If I build an enchanting building and a jewelcrafting building is there still a point for me to still have those professions?
Having the profession yourself doubles I think the daily cooldown production, and gives access to some extra recipes. Muffinus
