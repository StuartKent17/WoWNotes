Conquest Vendors Update
Giving a quick update. We're in the process of running internal tests to see if the fix is working correctly. We hope to have it out of testing as soon as possible. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/269287-conquest-vendors-temporarily-disabled/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9972358604?page=18#347

Gearing up Alt Characters
I dinged a fresh 90 on Monday, and yes I went straight to the Timeless Isle. However, in questing greens & blues, I had a very hard time. Also, I still have to go through all the old raids in LFR to unlock the latest content, not to mention get my item level high enough to enter. 

I've picked up a few purples on the Timeless Isle, but I'm still nowhere near high enough yet to enter SoO LFR. Sure, if you go for it really hard and prepare with crafted goods, Valor gear etc. I'm sure it can be done. But that's why the system's good IMO, if you put in the effort you can be caught up quickly, if you're more of a casual player like me it's going to take a while, and I'm fine with that personally.

I much prefer this to the alternative—getting my alt to level 90 then having to go through the exact same content I spent months on with my other characters.

Patch 5.4 PvP Balance
Hope 6.0 will be that one patch we've been waiting since s8 to finally fix everything. 
It's impossible to "fix" everything because there will always be a certain aspect of the game that someone will have an issue with, or a part they don't enjoy as much as the other. Perfection is also an endless pursuit because it's an ever elusive goal. We're constantly aiming to make the game the best it possibly can be, but to fix what someone feels is wrong will inevitably break it for someone else, so the things that are "broken" change via your own perception.

- blizzard doesn't care about all mage specs in PvP 
Every spec in the game right now is viable for participation in PvP, and we care about all specs. Your complaint is not that "Blizzard doesn't care", it's that you don't feel that certain specs aren't entirely viable for high end arena. This goes for several classes though, not just mages; warrior, paladin, druid and monk tank specs and others are not viable for high end PvP either. 

The biggest thing to note is that there are actually more specs now than ever before that are viable for a "Tier 1/2 comp", and at least one spec from each class is capable of reaching high ratings in PvP depending on team composition. We would be extremely pleased if we were able to reach a point in balance where all 34 specs were perfectly balanced, however we're well aware that the possibilities of accomplishing this is an incredibly difficult goal.

We'll continue to do our best to achieve the most enjoyable and balanced gameplay possible for everyone and we really appreciate all of the feedback that you're all giving in this thread about what you do and don't like about patch 5.4.

Classes
Honestly how many classes "get benched" I haven't seen a dps class get benched even one time this xpak
It is one of those terms that lost its meaning like "literally!" through overuse. I think many now used "benched" as a synonym. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377202457161383936

Could I get your thoughts on this concept http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=41405684#41405684? Are healers an intrinsic problem in PvP games generally?
They are definitely a problem when trying to balance the option to have a healer or not have a healer. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377566054987206656
I'm also open to the idea that having dedicated healers in PvP period is unsolveable. #notanannouncement Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377567668338835456

is it acceptable for one class warriors to not have a single dps spec in the top 20 dps specs? Why is this the case, then?
Don't worry about stack ranks. Worry about your spec's or better yet, your character's DPS relative to the average. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376878579604135937

so what are people who love their character supposed to do when they no longer enjoy their class?
We struggle with that question, at a philosophical level, a great deal. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377207594319761408
The con is the player and there are many who can't keep up with class changes if they skip an expansion or even a patch. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377207841318117376
We hear *constantly* from players who say I love my X but I just can't bear to relearn how to play yet again, so I'm out. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377208022050680832

I think a good rule of thumb is, if you enjoy your class, eff the numbers.
I get that there is a threshold. If you love your class but feel like you are holding your friends back, that's hard. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377208502071988224
But just because the best players in the world do better with class X, does not mean *you* are holding your friends back. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377208602798219264

OK you're probably sick of hearing this, but feels like my ProtWar has exactly zero choice in Major glyph. DPS = mandatory. =/
Yeah we discussed this a few weeks ago. We can't make tank glyphs survival, healing or DPS. Doesn't leave many options. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377909694360084480

Character / Items
We have a request with many people on french forum : why gnome can't do hunter when all race can? We are curious
We get many requests to make X class available to Y race. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377206786987532289
At a fundamental level, the question is whether there is benefit in any racial restrictions on class or not. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377206975232081920

Hi Greg. IF the item squish was to happen, would PvP and PvE gear once again have similar ilvls? WPvP purposes. Ty.
We don't know yet, but that would be a nice goal for sure. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377526603816779776

Just out of curiosity, how does RPPM differ from old style trinkets if unaffected by haste? That seemed the point
RPPM can proc twice in a row. Old style trinkets tended to proc when their ICD was over, making them really predictable. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377198000700792832
But Because of the RNG involved, who would want to use an RPPM trink over ICD if both technically Equal?
There is personal preference involved for sure, which we actually like. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377211510105178112
The RPPM trinket could proc 3 times during Bloodlust while the ICD cannot. But the RPPM might not proc at all. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377211644486504448

Flex Raiding
After downing a boss in a flex raid, is a raid guaranteed at least X items or are all rolls individual poss. getting 0 loot?
You can get 0 loot or you can get 25 loot. Both are exceedingly rare, but given enough raids, will happen to someone. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378283562044116992

Flex definitely feels like a progression difficulty coming straight out of LFR. My mana was crying!
Remember that you don't have the benefit of previous tiers of flex to gear up. This should be the only time that happens. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377909862664925184

Might we see LFR phased out in favor of Flex? If opening end-game content to all is the goal, perhaps dif way to achieve it?
If you want to raid say on your lunch break, LFR works for that but flex may not. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377910529852841984
