The Free T-Shirt Day (https://ptr.wowdb.com/world-events/1053-free-t-shirt-day) Micro-Holiday is now active on the PTR.<br>
<br>
<br>
An NPC marked on your map with a rare mob icon wanders around either The Valley of Honor (Orgrimmar) or the Dwarven District (Stormwind).<br>
The NPC carries a t-shirt gun and periodically launches one. A t-shirt appears on the ground that becomes clickable (https://ptr.wowdb.com/objects/310737-free-t-shirt).<br>
Clicking the shirt gives you either:<br>
<br>
A blue item called &quot;Free T-Shirt&quot; that visually removes the upper portions of your armor to expose the shirt you are wearing underneath. You can only use this item if you are wearing a shirt in the slot.<br>
A variety of cosmetic shirts<br>
