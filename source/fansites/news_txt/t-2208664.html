Kirin Tor Quests and Flying Mounts<br>
We haven&apos;t decided whether or not we&apos;ll make any changes to restrict flying on the Kirin Tor World Quests. We did anticipate they would become a lot easier with flying and, as such, we have no intention of taking action against players who use flying to easily complete these World Quests in their current state.
