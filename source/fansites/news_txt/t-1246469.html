Patch 5.2 - Warlock Island<br>
It isn&apos;t clear where this island will be used, if at all, during the new Warlock quest line (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/classes/warlock?filter-expansion=5) for green fire. The sky is similar to the one used in the Black Temple, where most of the quest line takes place. The second part of the Island is just a copy of the Maw of Neltharion (http://www.wowpedia.org/Maw_of_Neltharion).<br>
<br>
Don&apos;t forget that this is not ready or intended to be previewed, is not a 100% accurate preview, and is likely to change before release.<br>

Patch 5.2 - New Heirloom Items<br>
Patch 5.2 adds several new Heirloom items (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=16408&amp;filter-quality=128) that scale to level 85. These are upgraded versions of current heirlooms and can be purchased with the old heirloom and Justice Points. <br>
<br>
The Justice Points cost is the same as it is for the level 80 version (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-expansion=4&amp;filter-quality=128&amp;filter-slot=2359278). The new shields cost 2175 Justice Points.<br>

PTR Access &#x2013; Known Issue<br>
We&#x2019;re aware that some players are having connection issues when attempting to log into the Public Test Realm. We&#x2019;re investigating the issue with our QA and development teams to resolve the problem.<br>
<br>
Please be aware that our Customer Support department cannot assist with issues pertaining to PTR access, or upgrading your current PTR account&apos;s status. If you have an open ticket we&#x2019;d appreciate you closing it and waiting for further updates here regarding resolution of the issue.<br>
<br>
Thank you all for the reports and for your patience. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/249948-ptr-access-known-issue/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7591979213?page=1#1))<br>

Patch 5.2 and Conquest Points<br>
As far as I can tell we still haven&#x2019;t released information about when the current arena season will be over.<br>
<br>
But whenever a season ends, Conquest Points usually reset, and get converted to Honor and/or gold when above the cap. You can probably expect the same thing to happen this time, but we&#x2019;ll provide more exact information when we get closer to the end of the season.<br>
<br>
Don&apos;t worry too much about it, we always put out some news whenever a PvP season is about to end with at least 1 or 2 weeks&#x2019; notice.

Elegon Hotfix<br>
This specific hotfix requires realm restarts, which have not happened since it went in. The fix should be picked up with maintenance next week. Sorry about the confusion!

LFR to See Content<br>
If you&apos;re pressed for time and your goal is to see and experience raid content, LFR(Looking For Raid) is available and a relatively accessible way to experience that content. The item levels dropped from LFR isn&apos;t as high end as those from Heroic modes, but your character&apos;s item level doesn&apos;t have to be the sole barometer of how much fun you&apos;re having.

What is the ETA for Stormwind and Orgrimmar Repairs?<br>
With the majority of stone and lumber being sent to the various war fronts for construction and repairs, there&apos;s essentially nothing left for the craftsmen to work with. In fact, the laborers seen toiling over the constructions are not actually doing anything. We&apos;ve told them they can go home, or volunteer for Pandaria duty, but every day they climb up those ladders, and every day slowly hammer at boards and walls to no effect. They take their lunches in solitude, sometimes taking a break to stare at the sun, and at the end of their shift they climb down and go home. <br>
<br>
They&apos;ve repeated this every day for over two years. We&apos;re quite worried about them. Top men are currently investigating the possibility of providing them with twigs and small rocks with the belief that some progress may snap them out of it. <br>

How many grunts must the Horde call upon<br>
Before patch five point two is here?<br>
Yes, &apos;n&apos; how many troops must the Alliance train for war<br>

Yes, &apos;n&apos; how many ales must be brewed in advance<br>
Before the Pandaren can be well supplied?<br>
The answer, my friend, is comin&apos; soon indeed,<br>

Future<br>
How about next raid content? &#x130;t will be a equal quality with ulduar and sunwell?<br>
I&apos;m pretty excited about it personally, but I don&apos;t want to overpromise anything. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281531121714466816))<br>
<br>
Wasn&apos;t the Void Storage feature supposed to work WITH the Transmog, so we could transmog things that are in the Void Storage?<br>
It was designed to work the way it does, but not having to move stuff out of VS is a common request we&apos;re considering. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280723005955514368))<br>
<br>
So, going by the information available as of now, 5.2 will once again be a 5 months wait?<br>
Was 5.1? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279762074761060352))<br>
5.1 was supposed to be launched with Mists. It was cut and &quot;masked&quot; as a patch to combat GW2. 5.2 isn&apos;t like that.<br>
I think you greatly overestimate our ability to hit a target date even if we paid that close attention to competitors. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280717237017538560))<br>
<br>
2. try: is there a chance we will ever see flying combats / air pvp ? maybe as a bg or open world ?<br>
Pretty unlikely TBH. It would take huge changes to our combat engine. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281530772815499264))<br>
<br>
Are you guys still kinda working on that thing that has spells land on different parts of the target&apos;s body?<br>
Yeah. It won&apos;t be anytime soon though. It&apos;s a big project. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281522272966160384))<br>
<br>
What about the resource-collection part of the War Effort? That does&apos;t concentrate players in one spot.<br>
Yeah, the overall feel of that was pretty cool. Not sure farming Linen was, but a neat idea to revisit someday. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281861043804835840))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
You make raids for 2 or sometimes even 1 tank out of 25 people and wonder why there aren&apos;t more tanks...<br>
There were few tanks even back when the majority didn&apos;t raid. It&apos;s the responsibility IMO. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285137968140791808))<br>
<br>
Why were the fully raid buffed DPS dummies not implemented on live servers - only PTR? Intention behind this?<br>
We don&apos;t want players to obsess with theoretical DPS. Who wins a target dummy doesn&apos;t actually mean anything. On PTR it&apos;s to help us. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279064255775510528))<br>
But that&apos;s punishing the theory crafters who hate using sims but would rather the real thing; over a dumb epeen contest<br>
I&apos;d argue that the dumb contest would do more damage to the game than better theorycrafting would bring. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285160201231953920))<br>
<br>
LFR is awful. What happened to encouraging people to do content with friends and guild? Another blow to alts as well.<br>
I 100% believe you will have more fun and stick with the game longer if you play with friends. LFR is for when you can&apos;t. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285155117248950272))<br>
<br>
also do you have anything in mind for pvp power to enhance heals outside instances? world-pvp being so important now<br>
Unless something changed recently, PvP Power does enhance heals in the outdoor world. Just not in instances. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285147327960846336))<br>
<br>
linear progression was the worst idea you ever could return to.. you leave behind lots of alt-players and returners.<br>
We understand that. But the alternative is that other players feel their accomplishments have no meaning if rapid catch up exists. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285146067228561408))<br>
