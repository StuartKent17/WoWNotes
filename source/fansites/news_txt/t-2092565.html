Patch 7.0 - Hidden Secrets<br>
It looks like there are still hidden things in Patch 7.0 other than Artifact Appearances!<br>
Cant believe 7.1 is about to launch and no one has found the hidden... heh. Nm. Who&apos;s excited about the weekend??? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787104748985921536))<br>
<br>
When they still havent found the 7.0 secrets and 7.1 is almost out... *sighs @ the ocean* (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787115388685299712))<br>
Does whatever is still hidden have a notice at all? So we know if things are found or not?<br>
Not to spoil anything but yes just about everything about it has been datamined (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787122169318772736))<br>
<br>
Its not in the ocean, the ocean is just a good thing to sigh wistfully at, you can stop looking in the ocean. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787312606142795776))<br>
<br>
Outside of skins, ARE there some hidden things that players should be looking for?<br>
in 7.0? Actuallly... yes. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787107433575354368))<br>

Patch 7.1 - Karazhan Attunement<br>
Attunement to Karazhan will require follower ilvl of 850.<br>
This is false, and based on misinterpreted datamining. The ilvl 850 follower mission associated with Karazhan is an &quot;Investigate&quot; mission, which gives you a quest for some bonus loot, exactly like the existing missions that send you into dungeons or into Emerald Nightmare.<br>
<br>
The attunement questline for Karazhan primarily involves Mythic dungeon content. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/775942-gating-content-behind-follower-missions/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17613702560?page=1#2))<br>
<br>
Patch 7.1 Arrives on October 25!<br>
Is Nighthold coming out in 7.1?<br>
7.1 contains mainly the Return to Karazhan Mythic Dungeon and the Trial of Valor raid. Nighthold is not part of this patch.<br>
<br>
Too soon, You have given us content too soon Executusornyx.<br>
I think you will find yourself pleasantly surprised by the span of content throughout Legion. We&apos;ve already noted that Nighthold is slated for early 2017.

I hate that StM is mandatory to be viable right now. We need two better viable talents that compete. I agree.<br>
But fixing the row is a larger undertaking, and meanwhile, better to be a one-trick pony than a no-trick pony... (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/785851058400686080))<br>

Will the Free For All, More For Me (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11474-free-for-all-more-for-me) achievement be retroactive, or will we need to complete the world quests in 7.1?<br>
They will need to be completed in 7.1. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/786249711451672578))<br>

Pet Battles<br>
Now that that is over, what would it take you, random person, to get into pet battling? I&apos;m talking sweet rewards here. AP? A new dog pet? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/785312742227972096))<br>
Something cool, like a storyline or something more of an upfront progression. Currently it seems like an afterthought system?<br>
completely agree that an overarching quest/storyline could be a lot of fun! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/785315315420762112))<br>

Environment<br>
Using your creativity and ability to work within the World of Warcraft art style, create a small environment diorama that would fit well in the game world. Your quest: Concept, model, and texture an environment piece that you could imagine stumbling upon during your travels across Kalimdor, the Eastern Kingdoms, Outland, Northrend, Pandaria or the Broken Isles.<br>
<br>
Required elements are trees, rocks, grass, and props, plus a small structure (such as a shrine).<br>
<br>
Your final piece should have a structure similar to the example provided below. We&apos;re looking for lower poly-count models (e.g.: around 1,500 polys for a mature sized tree), so keep that in mind when creating your environment.<br>
<br>

<br>
Character Art<br>
Using your creativity and ability to work within the World of Warcraft art style, concept, model, and texture a non-player character (NPC) or creature that you could imagine roaming the plains of Durotar, exploring the depths of Deepholm, or just sitting in the Pig and Whistle Tavern knocking back a mug o&#x2019; Thistle Tea.<br>
<br>
Required elements are the character or creature, along with some sort of clothing or armor. Feel free to go further by adding weapons or other accessories.<br>
<br>
The final piece should have a structure similar to the example provided below. Stay within a budget of 6,000 polys with one 1024x1024 texture for the finished character.<br>
