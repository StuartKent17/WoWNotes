Warlords of Draenor - Darker Nights
Mumper recently let us know that some work related to darker nights is underway, so we took a look at what nights look like in several parts of Draenor. These screenshots show the areas with bigger differences between night and day, so keep in mind many areas currently don't change much at all.

the new feral DoC... will we just receive healing from rejuv when put on someone else or will there be a buff gained when casted
You gain a Rejuv as well. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/482994524877094912
Thanks and also will there be any snapshotting for feral bleeds with TF or bloodtalons, or is it entirely gone? Thanks
Those will explicitly snapshot. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/482995700657958912
Ok, so pretty much just snapshotting bleeds from trinkets procs are gone?
Correct. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/483000431732224001

This is a horrible change, please revert. There are loads of situations where I might choose "inappropriate one". How about RP?
Plan for travel form: one button does Aqua+Stag+Flight, baseline. Glyph splits it into Aqua+RideableStag and Flight. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/482983505102532608
Seriously? I need to glyph out of that mess? ugh...
I'm guessing the 'mess' you're referring to is the bugs that there currently are with it. We'll fix those. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/483000339184885760
in places where I can fly, I still don't always want flight form with no ground travel form available.
Then grats, your desire will be satisfied by this solution. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/483001673648857088
I dont see why youre trying so hard to make it work as 1 button. Is it the end of the world if the forms are seperate?
Because constantly iterating and improving the game is what we strive to do. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/483002844165849089
I'm not sure constantly iterating is something that's good to strive for, without the improvement part 
Of course not. Change for change's sake is bad. However, it's sometimes hard for each individual to see improvement. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/483003814216081408

clarification on pris crystal. manual target or auto redirect? concerns about clunkiness and/or movement fights?
It will automatically target it when you place it, but you can still swap targets off of it if you want. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/482956015806070784

Ever thought about stacking pyroblasts, like arcane missiles or ice lances do already?
Yeah, but you kind of already get that with Heating Up, and stacking further would lose the gameplay of spending vs saving. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/482987208953970688

while DP is active. Also, it forces us to pick Solace /Insanity so we don't feel gimped while we mindflay.
It doesn't force you into that at all. MSpike still removes DoTs to ensure rotational variety. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/482715468516425730
Don't find it odd while our "burst" window is up DP we are forced to use a weaker spell - MindFlay- instead of MSpike w/ CoP?
In a playstyle that otherwise has higher burst? No, not really. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/482723238657540097

Whirlwind as part of ST rotation just shows how little idea you have of what to do with warriors. No other class has AOE for ST.
Right, except for Arcane, Fire, Frost, Demo, DfA Rogues, Ferals, Enhance, Windwalkers, Frost DKs, T16 Rets, and all tanks. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/483039169032101888
Fire? If you mean Ignite/Combustion spreads, I don't think splash dmg from ST spell = primarily AE spell.
Living Bomb / Unstable Fireball / Blast Wave. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/483042379981541377
Ok, that's kinda my point: Fireball isn't primarily AE; Unstable is a bonus to it. Bomb, I'd agree. BW, worth using ST?
Absolutely. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/483043596442947584

PvE
with the responsiveness change will we see more "twitch" mechanics in raids ie wrack, defile, interrupts on Maloriak?
I wouldn't say "more" - but dealing with the ones we do have will feel better. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/482716365015351296
I can't promise there won't still be that "but I was out of it on my screen, look at my corpse!" guy in your raid, though. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/482716473329074176

PvP
Agree with shared sets for pve and pvp but they should be different for the factions. I like glorious ones for ally
The plan is to color them different by faction holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/482940805133266944

So will there be lag problems with the Huge pvp zone and capital zones sharing the same area? We did shy from that in WOTLK
Ashran is on a different instance. The staging areas are on your home realm. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/482690300393951232

Is Mekkatorque still going to be kind of "open beta" server, or you changed your mind?
We haven't changed our mind. It was always a second server for those with beta access. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/482718490910932992
I mean, what about that PvP server, with broad access, for more precise testing purposes; still in plans?
that was never the plan. I think some people misinterpreted what we said about a separate PvP realm during beta. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/482719738435338240

ever any talk about rated/queued 1v1s? Queue up just how you would 2s/3s/5s but you queue into just a duel?
.No plans for a 1v1 queue but one awesome change in Warlords for duelers is we can reset cooldowns at the start of a duel now! holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/482723249139113984

how will the new pvp toggle affect cross realm raid groups? I was thinking pvp player gets pulled to pve server how will that work?
it uses the host realms rules holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/482909008357888000

Will Skirmishes be available for lower levels aswell or just max? 
the plan is lower level as well holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/483380585516109824

Reputation / Questing
I really feel the introductory Tanaan quest chain should be phased. Really breaks immersion, otherwise. 
Phased, or instanced, where it's your own personal storyline? It's similar to the DK start experience, which had other players. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/482708031868637184
