We&apos;re getting closer to the release of Patch 3.2 on test realms and it seems that character copies are now activated. Premade characters are available and you can already copy them on both continents.<br>

Recent In-Game Fixes - 6/22/09<br>
6/22/09<br>
We are in the process of applying an in-game fix that will restart all of the quests associated with the Midsummer Fire Festival event and allow players to complete them once again. If you are in the process of completing an achievement such as Extinguishing Kalimdor, this fix will reset your progress and you will need start over. This fix will require realms to be restarted. <br>

Resilience more effective in 3.2<br>
I think you are dividing the bucket too cleanly into &#x201C;classes that can survive&#x201D; and &#x201C;classes that can&#x2019;t.&#x201D; There has been a vigorous debate for some time within the community (and not just this forum) about damage and healing being too high in PvP. While some classes are worse than others, those are also the classes that received additional nerfs. Overall we need for characters to be a little more survivable when being beat on. They need a little more room to come up with a counter of some kind so that too many fights are not &#x201C;use your ability within this 1 sec window or lose.&#x201D; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899681400-resilience-change.html))<br>

More Mana Regeneration needed in 3.2 Arenas?<br>
That assumes that caster mana is balanced around 30 second fights. It isn&#x2019;t, and we aren&#x2019;t talking about suddenly going to 30 minute fights. It could very well be a problem in practice, but we think it&#x2019;s premature to assume that all dps casters are going to run out of mana now. There can be something between the two extremes of dying in 2 GCDs and having endless matches where the team to go OOM first loses. There can be something in between a sprint and a marathon.

Roar of Sacrifice in 3.2<br>
We like Roar of Sacrifice being used on other players for many of the same reasons players originally asked for it to be when we changed it. Furthermore, it&apos;s a talented pet ability, so it doesn&apos;t seem like that should be the linchpin of hunter PvP survival.<br>
<br>
At this point we are probably likely to keep RoS as is (though we may have room to lower the cooldown a little) but buff Deterrence by removing the facing requirement. Deterrence is supposed to be your survival tool and RoS is supposed to be a cool bonus ability.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m sorry you don&apos;t like it when PvE concerns affect PvP or vice versa. WoW supports both types of gameplay and we need to balance around both of them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17900023373-hunters-dont-go-through-with-the-ros-change.html))<br>

Beacon of Light<br>
<br>
I&#x2019;ll try one more time. The following is painfully simplistic to the point of inaccurate, but I&#x2019;m not sure how else to express the logic cleanly.<br>
<br>
PvE problem: Paladin healing routine is boring.<br>
Solution: Make Beacon usable on more targets.<br>
New PvE problem: Paladins are too good because mana regen is too high.<br>
Solution: Nerf Illumination (+1 for Beacon -1 for Illumination = 0).<br>
<br>
PvP problem: Damage and healing are too high.<br>
Solution: Change resilience and nerf healing. For paladins, the regen nerf already made above is probably sufficient for the latter.<br>
New PvP problem: But the buff to Beacon counteracts this nerf in PvE, leaving paladins at a net higher level of power (+1 for Resilience -1 for Illumination + 1 for Beacon = 1 (when we want zero)).<br>
Solution: None needed because Beacon isn&#x2019;t a huge factor in PvP (the equation above is actually +1 for Resilience -1 for Illumination = 0). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899681400-resilience-change.html))<br>

Rogues able to use axes in 3.2<br>
Most of the axes will be one-hand, not main-hand. The reason we make the fists MH or OH isn&apos;t as a special favor to rogues or anything. It is usually because the art is designed to be left-handed or right-handed and looks really odd in the wrong hand (this is true of swords sometimes too). An axe is an axe though so we can make most if not all of them one-handed. We will drop more axes with this change -- this is why we are making the change. Shamans in Ulduar felt like there weren&apos;t enough axes. We want to be able to give them more options.

Enhancement DPS in PvP<br>
I understand the concern. We know that Enhancement shaman dps is in a really good place in PvE. Your experience in PvP seems to be that you can&#x2019;t kill healers. The problem is we are hearing (and observing) many situations where players are dying in only a few hits. We have nerfed some of the big hitting abilities of say DKs, Retadins and even Destro locks. But we think damage would still be high even with those changes. If a single Enhancement shaman can take out a single healer, then when the healer is focused by two dps at once, they will have no chance.

Warrior Tanking / Block / Rage Starvation<br>
<br>
I&#x2019;m not sure that statement is accurate, but here is the problem. There are A LOT of warrior tanks. They are tanking every fight in Ulduar. If warriors were too low and if we buffed them, I don&#x2019;t see how that would increase the numbers on the other tanks. I don&#x2019;t think the conclusion to be drawn is that warriors are overpowered. I think the conclusion to be drawn is that warriors were the traditional tank and lot of established guilds have established MTs who see no reason to reroll the FotM. It&#x2019;s not actually a goal to have 25% of each tank in Ulduar, but is also seems strange to buff the most popular tank. Won&#x2019;t that just make them more popular? Again, don&#x2019;t misinterpret that as GC sez suck it up warriors. It is something we have to keep in mind, however.<br>
<br>
Block is a systemic problem. We&apos;re not sure we can make it a very compelling mitigation stat in a world where tank avoidance is so high and bosses hit so hard. However I will say that the Coliseum fights should focus less on the blow-your-cooldowns-or-die style of encounter.<br>
<br>
Rage starvation is a problem. Frankly, we&apos;re not sure a model where you have to get hit in order to tank is that compelling anymore. Something that has come up a lot is changing rage (even for Prot) to damage done. This is a slight nerf to the PvP mechanic of being punished when you hit the warrior, but there are other ways to solve that as well. Again, we&apos;re talking a big change here. I&apos;m not sure we&apos;re comfortable jacking with such a core mechanic before 3.2. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17899683851-warrior-community-let-down.html))</div></div>
