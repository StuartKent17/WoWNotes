It seems that the next in-game item from the Blizzard Store went online today for a short moment before it was taken down by Blizzard. It will most likely be available on live servers very soon and we had time to gather most of the information on them. 



Each set of wings costs $19,99 and can be bought separately. 
You can buy both sets for $29,99. 
Just like any Flying mount, the wings require Expert Riding http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/34090/expert-riding/ and their speed will scale up to 310% depending on your riding skill.

These items are much more important than the ones previously sold on the Blizzard store and will have their own Feats of Strength.
