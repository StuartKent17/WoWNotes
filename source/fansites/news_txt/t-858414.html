Assuming that everything goes as planned today (new patches take time!), things should get interesting soon (starting today with fun models)! <br>
<br>
&quot;Salamander Hunter&quot; and Crimson Fire Hawk<br>
The new model of Ragnaros was very popular yesterday, let&apos;s kick it up a notch with the model of Crimson Fire Hawk (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/97493/crimson-fire-hawk/) and a new monster, the &quot;Salamander Hunter&quot; (who looks a lot like Majordomo Executus (http://www.wowpedia.org/Majordomo_Executus)).<br>
<br>
More to come soon. <br>

Guild Recruitment<br>
Patch 4.1 will apparently introduce the in-game guild recruitment system promised during Blizzcon! So far we don&apos;t have a lot of details on how it will work but the interface can be accessed on PTRs, we&apos;ll probably see more of it in later phases of testing. <br>
