Icecrown/Arthas Cinematic
I don't really like to spoil lore, and the video below contains A LOT of spoilers. This is the cinematic related to the Arthas/Icecrown storyline, we didn't really talk about this kind of lore on the front page because I don't think it's useful to spoil it, it kinda breaks the fun especially in WotLK where a lot of work has been done on the lore

Watch the video at your own risks - Download Link ;11881764;/fileinfo.html No embed yet, don't want people to click it without reading
