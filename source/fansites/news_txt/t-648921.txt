Boubouille2009-05-17, 06:12 AMWoW TCG - Fields of Honor Loot Card Preview Descriptions from Upperdeck.com http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/wow/en/news/article.aspx?aid=5878 
With the release of WoW TCG’s ninth full expansion on June 30th, Fields of Honor, players will be able to get their hands on three exciting new loot cards that offer up fun in-game items that will make them stand out in any crowd! 

Note: Even if this isn't official yet, players can test all these items on the 3.1.2 test realms by using the PTR test codes with Landro Longshot http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=17249

Path of Cenarius - PTR Test Code = 1111
Path of Illidan isn’t for everybody. What if you roleplay as lawful good? You wouldn’t scorch the ground with demon fire! Your Druid certainly wouldn’t do that to the land! The good guys can notch a win with Path of Cenarius. The consumable and ultra-common loot of the set allows your character to spread warmth, cheer, and growth to the land- certainly something desperately needed in the barren wastelands of Northrend. Stand up to Arthas with flower power!

Piñata PTR Test Code = 2222
Here is ultimate party animal in World of Warcraft and the uncommon loot card in the set- the loot piñata. Long-running jokes of Grobbulus and other bosses aside, your character can set up this Ogre Piñata on it’s own little portable tree anywhere and let loose. Use magic or melee- just attack it until it blows up! It explodes and rains candy gumballs, and eating the gumballs will buff your character so that it chews gum and blows bubbles. It’s Halloween every day with Piñata!

El Pollo Grande PTR Test Code = 3333
“Death to Stormwind! Death by chicken!” shouts Niby the Almighty. Expecting a blazing Infernal but summoning El Pollo Grande, the Felwood warlock prepares for his revenge. Unlike Niby, you want to crack El Pollo Grande. You need it. Why? The short: your MMO character will ride a rooster- a giant, Magic Rooster.
