Ruins of Theramore Preview<br>
WARNING! WARNING! - Skip this video if you don&apos;t want to see what happens to Theramore!<br>
<br>
As always, this is an early version of the area, previewed through unofficial means. This is absolutely not representative of the final version, it&apos;s just a preview. We don&apos;t have a lot of details about this area, as it is not part of the main map and could be part of a phased event. Keep in mind that the press tour did mention Theramore as a possible scenario for the pre Mists of Pandaria event. <br>
