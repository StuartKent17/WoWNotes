<br>
M&apos;uru ... and Entropius ?<br>
If you&apos;ve been watching PTR raid progression closely, you probably know that the next boss to kill is M&apos;uru. There isn&apos;t much progression on him for the moment, however there is something interesting in the game files : a boss named Entropius !<br>
<br>
Now, take a look at the first screenshot and see if you notice something unusual between the two monsters ? Nothing ? Check the 2nd screenshot. <br>

<br>
Of course that&apos;s some crazy speculation, but the similarities between the two monsters are really strange and it&apos;s not like Entropius could fit anywhere else in the Sunwell Plateau ... the next boss after M&apos;uru being Kil&apos;jaeden. Based on the information I&apos;ve got I&apos;d say that M&apos;uru has been corrupted by Entropius, and you&apos;ll have to fight both of them in the Sunwell Plateau (with Entropius appearing in a later phase of the fight). <br>

Wrath of the Lich King - The Tuskarr<br>
A few days ago, the official WotLK site has been updated with an article about Tuskarrs (http://www.wow-europe.com/wrath/features/factions/tuskarr.xml).<br>
Despite the absence of any records documenting the tuskarr&apos;s past, many significant facts have recently come to light.<br>
<br>
The tuskarr are a kind-natured nomadic race that roams the southern coastlines of Northrend, guided by the carved cyclopean statues that mark their seasonal fishing routes. The tuskarr&apos;s tribal affiliation is evidenced by the sigils inscribed on their tusks, and although they are a peaceful race, they are constantly beset by taunka and local murlocs.<br>
<br>
Yet even their enemies marvel at the tuskarr&apos;s prowess and fearlessness in catching some of the most dangerous creatures in Northrend&apos;s frigid waters, including whales and giant squid. Not even the unnamed leviathans that lurk in the ocean&apos;s depths are beyond the tuskarr&apos;s reach.<br>
<br>
The tuskarr have seen their share of difficult times, but with the Horde&apos;s recent arrival they have found a new ally in the ongoing struggle against the hostile forces of Northrend.<br>
