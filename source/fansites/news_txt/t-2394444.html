Warmode and the Future of wPvP - Incentives<br>
We hope to have War Mode up very soon for everyone to try out. Until then, I&#x2019;ll outline a few details:<br>
<br>
Honor Talents enabled<br>
As mentioned by Ion and others, Honor Talents are on permanently while War Mode is enabled in the outdoor world. This was the case in Legion as well, but they would only enable when you got into &#x201C;PvP combat&#x201D; causing them to enable and disable while playing which ended up feeling a bit &#x201C;janky.&#x201D; Players may also find some added benefit with Honor Talents against normal PvE creatures as well, which is designed to be part of a &#x201C;package of bonuses&#x201D; to offset the inherit lost efficiency of World PvP. <br>
<br>
Gear scaling<br>
In order to create a fair fights and good gameplay, our goal is to limit the extremes in power between players in War Mode that come from gear and level. We want you to have an advantage if your gear is better, but within reason. The experience should be something similar to Unrated Battlegrounds in Legion (but without the stat templates). Keep in mind this is scaling only in PvP combat, so your power against creatures in the world will remain the same as it would be with War Mode disabled.<br>
<br>
Conquest and World PvP<br>
In Battle for Azeroth you&#x2019;ll earn conquest for doing PvP activities similar to how it was gained in the past: Rated Arena and Rated Battlegrounds as well as some light conquest from Unrated Battlegrounds. But what&#x2019;s new is earning conquest from doing World PvP activities. This gives you an additional source when filling up that &#x201C;conquest bar&#x201D; for your weekly conquest item.<br>
<br>
Bounty Hunting <br>
How do you earn conquest in World PvP? One source is from killing other players, of course. But the more of the opposing faction you slay, the higher chance they will put a bounty on your head. When a bounty is put on you, it will be announced to all opposing players in the zone and you will appear on the main map for a reward. Good luck!<br>
<br>
And more...<br>
While we have one or two other content features in War Mode we&#x2019;ll share later on, one of our goals is to keep it minimal. As you point out Ion saying, we want to create a foundation first which we can hopefully build upon (with your feedback!) in the future.</div></div>
