Facebook/Twitter TCG Loot Code Giveaway
It's time for another TCG Loot giveaway, courtesy of WoWTCGLoot.com  once again. 

People who liked the MMO-Champion Page on Facebook  will have a chance to win 2 x Landro's Pet Box !
Following me on Twitter.com  will give you a chance to win 2 x Landro's Pet Box  as well!

How does it work?
It's easy, just become a Fan of MMO-Champion on Facebook  and/or Follow me on Twitter ! Winners will be picked randomly at 08:00PM PST and the code will be sent to the winning Twitter/Facebook account shortly after. 

I had some time to learn how all that stuff works and you can probably expect more interesting loot super-soon ... and surprise tweets if I'm in the mood!
