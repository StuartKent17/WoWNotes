Thor In-Game Pet in SC2 Collector Edition<br>
According to a press release published a few hours ago, Blizzard will offer a WoW in-game pet with the collector edition of Starcraft 2. So far it looks like that if you didn&apos;t plan to buy Starcraft 2 and REALLY want your pet, you will have to pay $100 for it. <br>
<br>
The good news is, if you want the Starcraft 2 Collector Edition and do not care about the pet, you will probably sell it on ebay for $90. <br>

Players who purchase either edition will be able to play online for no additional fee through the new version of Battle.net&#xAE;, the premier online gaming destination for Blizzard Entertainment gamers.<br>

Cataclysm Preview: Warrior Q&amp;A<br>
Here are some follow ups based on what is being discussed.<br>
<br>
Q: Will the rotation for a Fury Warrior just be Bloodthirst and Slam with Heroic Strike to burn off rage?<br>
A: We think Fury is going to end up needing another attack in there for single-target fights. Furious Sundering was intended more as having to Sunder being less of a penalty, but at only 3 stacks, it may not end up being a big deal and we don&#x2019;t want Fury to feel like they have to purchase a talent that they may not always use. We don&#x2019;t want Whirlwind to be a good button against single targets however. It essentially gets &#x201C;free&#x201D; damage against groups of targets when it&#x2019;s effective at using against single targets. It&#x2019;s okay if warriors still do more damage in fights where they can use Cleave and similar attacks often, but right now it&#x2019;s too extreme.<br>
<br>
Q: Are one-handed Fury warriors going to be competing with rogues for one-handed weapons?<br>
A: This is unlikely. Rogues and shaman will want one-handers with Agility, while warriors and death knights will want them with Strength. I won&#x2019;t be surprised when one of these classes picks up the other&#x2019;s weapon as it could be an upgrade simply based on the damage, but it won&#x2019;t be optimal.<br>
<br>
Q: Why are warriors not getting some kind of AoE tanking tool?<br>
A: We think the newly buffed Thunder Clap plus Shockwave are sufficient abilities for AoE tanking. The design of Vengeance should make sure that threat generation doesn&#x2019;t start to slip behind as the dps characters gear up. It&#x2019;s not our intention that tanks face a constant struggle to generate enough threat, even in group situations, but we also don&#x2019;t want threat to be totally irrelevant either. The danger for tanking too many creatures should also be tank death not threat management.<br>
<br>
Q: Is only Sunder Armor being changed?<br>
A: Rogue Expose Armor and other abilities that apply a similar debuff are being changed accordingly. They will all provide the same debuff at 12% armor reduction.<br>
<br>
Q: What about rage loss when changing stances?<br>
A: We still want the act of changing stances to require more consideration than just clicking two buttons to use the ability you want. One idea we are going to explore is that you don&#x2019;t lose rage when you change stances, but you won&#x2019;t gain additional rage for a short period of time after changing. This lets you say swap to do an Execute without losing your rage bar, but still keeps the idea that shifting constantly comes with inherent efficiency risks.<br>
<br>
Q: Is the intent of Gushing Wound that warriors constantly ask for targets to be kited around?<br>
A: No, it&#x2019;s intended to be a bonus when you&#x2019;re in an encounter where the target either moves around a lot (Ex. BONNNNE STORMMMM-ing Marrowgar) or just has to be moved around a lot (say Lich King). Warriors shouldn&#x2019;t have the expectation of forcing every PvE opponent to move but it would be entertaining to watch this (from a third party perspective). :)</div></div>
