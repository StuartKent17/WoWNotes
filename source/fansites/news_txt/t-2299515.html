Patch 7.3 Hotfixes - September 8<br>
Argus<br>

Fixed a bug that allowed players to teleport to the nearest flight point in Antoran Wastes even if it was inactive.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Broken Shore<br>
<br>
The Deliverance Point building accumulation rate has been increased for all regions. The intended result is for buildings to complete at approximately the same rate as they did before 7.3.<br>

Spec Tuning Coming 13 September<br>
With maintenance this week, we&#x2019;re going to make several spec damage tuning adjustments. Given the nature of the class changes we made in 7.3, we&#x2019;ve not needed tuning adjustments through the first two weeks of the patch. However, one change that is coming this week is a bonus to the item level of your Artifact weapon when you activate the Netherlight Crucible. That bonus has a varying effect on certain specs, because not all specs&#x2019; abilities scale the same with the DPS of their equipped weapon. This is something that we&#x2019;d like to address in the future, but for now, we can deal with it via tuning.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, there are a few specs that we&#x2019;d like to outright buff.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll implement the following damage increases to account for the Netherlight Crucible:<br>
<br>
Death Knight - Frost +4%<br>
Demon Hunter - Havoc +3% <br>
Druid - Feral +2%<br>
Hunter &#x2013; Beast Mastery +6%<br>
Hunter - Survival +5%<br>
Monk - Windwalker +9%<br>
Rogue - Assassination +5%<br>
Rogue - Outlaw +6%<br>
Rogue - Subtlety +1.5%<br>
Shaman - Enhancement +3%<br>
<br>
And as always, we&#x2019;ll continue to keep a close eye on performance going forward.<br>
<br>

Upcoming Change to Argus Waystones and Invasion Points<br>
I have several alts who have made progress towards 15 waystones, but aren&apos;t quite there yet. I&apos;m one invasion away on some of them. I really hope that when the fix gets pushed, I don&apos;t get my progress reset to doing 3 more, on every alt...<br>
<br>
Can we get some warning when the fix will be pushed, so people in my position have time to get their quest in before losing all the progress they&apos;d made? Or, just push the fix at the weekly reset?<br>
We&apos;re working to hotfix this with weekly resets on September 12. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1071498-upcoming-change-to-argus-waystones-and-invasion-points/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20758915904?page=2#26))<br>

Argussian Reach Emissary<br>
As of this writing, I have no Argussian quests on my map. I haven&apos;t unlocked McCree yet, but still not seeing any others anywhere else.<br>
Just as a tracking note - there were at least 2 yesterday for me, 3 by some accounts, and 4 including a Pet Battle World Quest. There&apos;s currently at least one more up in Mac&apos;Aree, and I did two more earlier today in Krokuun.<br>
<br>
As said before, more Argussian Reach World Quests will be available next week, and hopefully we won&apos;t see this issue again in the future. Thanks again for your patience and bearing with us here.
