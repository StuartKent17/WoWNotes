<div style="margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;">Move over Tyrande and Malfurion. Step aside Durotan and Draka. With the release of Blizzard's latest audio drama A Thousand Years of War, we finally learn about where Ranger General Alleria Windrunner  and her paladin companion High Exarch Turalyon  have been.

If you're not familiar with their story, don't feel too bad. Despite having statues dedicated to them in Stormwind's Valley of Heroes, items  and outposts  named for them, and a grown son , the two have been MIA for the last 20 plus years of Azeroth's history. A Thousand Years of War catches us up on all that lost time. 

But what were they doing before all that? And why is important that they make a return now? Let's get you caught up on their story of love and war before A Thousand Years of War catches you up on the rest.

Even if you don't know the details of these two lovebirds, you should be familiar with Alleria from her surname alone: Windrunner. The Windrunners are one of the oldest and most respected families of high elves, dating all the way back to the War of the Ancients  Alleria was foremost among her family, expected to succeed her mother Lireesa as the Ranger-General of Silvermoon. Instead, she chose to walk the path of the Farstriders  group of high elves who roamed the whole of Azeroth protecting the interests of their people. Eventually, it would be Alleria's sister Sylvannas  who would take the role of Silvermoon's Ranger General before the Scourge made her the Queen of the Forsaken.

It was during her time with the Farstriders that Alleria would first meet Turalyon, and from that fateful encounter they would be as inseparable as kobolds from candles.

Turalyon began his career as a priest. Through his talent, he was named as one of the original Knights of the Silver Hand , counting Uther Lightbringer  and Tirion Fordring  as comrades in arms. He was close friends with Archmage Khadgar  and Danath Trollbane  while being the lieutenant to Anduin Lothar  Where Alleria was related to some of the most important figures in Azeroth, Turalyon simply knew the rest.

Together, Turalyon and Alleria fought the orcish horde during and after the Second War , becoming close comrades and even closer friends. After a particularly devastating raid on Silvermoon City that saw a portion of the Windrunner family destroyed, Alleria sought comfort in her close friend, and the two became lovers shortly after that. It wasn't long before their son, Arator, was born of that union.

They fought battle after battle against the orcs, knowing little peace beyond each other. Their war eventually took them beyond the Dark Portal  into Draenor , hoping to stop the orc threat at the source.

But it was not to be.

The orc shaman and leader of the Horde, Ner'zhul , sought to escape defeat by opening portal after portal on Draenor, giving his Horde access to new and unspoiled worlds ripe for conquest. His powerful magic quickly became unstable and began to rip Draenor apart, sending the orcish armies into a panic and making them desperate to escape the splintering planet through the Dark Portal.

Alleria and Turalyon understood what they had to do. While they fought to keep the orcs on the Draenor side of the portal, Khadgar and his mages worked to close the portal for good, keeping Azeroth and all their loved ones shielded from Draenor's total destruction.

The ensuing chaos of Draenor's sundering into Outland  ripped the pair from the world and they disappeared. When the Dark Portal opened again, Khadgar and the rest were found. Alleria and Turalyon were not. So where were they?

In the Twisting Nether, lost from space and time until they were found by the Mother of Light herself, the naaru Xe'ra 

A Thousand Years of War picks up here. It tells the story of Alleria and Turalyon's journey with the Grand Army of Light  and how their new found powers could determine the fate of all life. They could even hold the key to defeating the Legion once and for all. I'm not going to spoil the specifics here, so check it out for yourself. And when you do, you'll see why theirs is one of the greatest love stories WoW ever told that wasn't Illidan and his brooding.</div>
