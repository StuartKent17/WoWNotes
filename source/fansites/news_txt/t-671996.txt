An interesting change was made to hippogryphs mounts in patch 3.3 .... they finally have ground animations! They will now walk and run just like any other mount.

Quests Datamining - Quel'Delar
There is a lot of speculation going on a few sites based on the Quel'Delar quest chain datamined a few days ago and available on the Database http://db.mmo-champion.com/. I figured I should add a few information here. 

First, do not expect a new player legendary item, this is most likely a storyline quest chain to ultimately give back the powerful sword to one of your faction leaders. The chain is as follow :

The Battered Hilt http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14443/the-battered-hilt/ - Bring the Battered Hilt to Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's rest.
What The Dragons Know http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14444/what-the-dragons-know/ - Speak to Krasus at the top of Wyrmrest Temple, then report your findings to Arcanist Tybalin in the Silver Enclave in Dalaran.
The Sunreaver Plan http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14457/the-sunreaver-plan/ - Bring the Sunreaver Orders to Arcanist Tybalin at the Silver Enclave in Dalaran.
A Suitable Disguise http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/20438/a-suitable-disguise/ - Obtain a Borrowed Tabard from Shandy Sparkleshine and bring it to Arcanist Tybalin at the Silver Enclave in Dalaran.
A Meeting With The Magister http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/20439/a-meeting-with-the-magister/ - Retrieve the Ancient Dragonforged Blades tome for Arcanist Tybalin in Dalaran's Silver Enclave.
Return to Caladis Brightspear http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24454/return-to-caladis-brightspear/ - Bring Ancient Dragonforged Blades to Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's Rest.
Re-Forging The Sword http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24461/re-forging-the-sword/ Provided: Remnants of Quel'Delar http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49740/remnants-of-quel-delar/ - Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's Rest wants you to obtain 5 Infused Saronite Bars and use the Forgemaster's Hammer to combine them with the Battered Hilt to create the Re-forged Quel'Delar.
Tempering the Blade http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24476/tempering-the-blade/ Provided: Reforged Quel'Delar http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49739/re-forged-quel-delar/ - 
The Halls of Reflection http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24480/the-halls-of-reflection/ - Bring your Tempered Quel'Delar to Sword's Rest inside the Halls of Reflection. Return to Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's rest after you have completed your journey.
Journey to the Sunwell http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24522/journey-to-the-sunwell/ - Speak with Halduron Brightwing at the entrance to the Sunwell Plateau on the Isle of Quel'Danas.
Thalorien Dawnseeker http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24535/thalorien-dawnseeker/ - Visit Thalorienn Dawnseeker's Remains and obtain his blessing to wield Quel'Delar, then return to Halduron Brightwing near the entrance to the Sunwell.
There is also The Purification of Quel'Delar Vereesa http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24553/the-purification-of-quel-delar/ / The Purification of Quel'Delar Aethas http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24594/the-purification-of-quel-delar/ / The Purification of Quel'Delar Mariel http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24595/the-purification-of-quel-delar/ but for some reasons this quest isn't included in the chain started by The Battered Hilt http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14443/the-battered-hilt/.

The Argent Crusade version of the description of The Purification of Quel'Delar Mariel http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24595/the-purification-of-quel-delar/ suggests that you will ultimately give the weapon to a NPC. "It may be best to entrust the weapon to the Argent Crusade, where it will serve as a symbol to unite the Lich King's enemies."

Now if you want some real speculation from quests datamining, I suggest that you keep these links bookmarked and check them after each PTR build to see if they are updated :

The Splintered Throne http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24548/the-splintered-throne/ - Probably related to the Frozen Throne ... and Arthas?
Shadowmourne, Blade of Legends http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24549/shadowmourne-blade-of-legends/ - Legendary weapon.
Icecrown Citadel Quests on the DB http://db.mmo-champion.com/quests/?zone=4812

One of the quest in the Icecrown Citadel is already available - The Sacred and the Corrupt http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24545/the-sacred-and-the-corrupt/

Objective
Place Light's Vengeance and Runeforged Saronite in Highlord Mograine's runeforge in Icecrown Citadel.

Description
It is against my judgment that I present you this errand, <race>, as it will likely end in your undoing.

Ignore my counsel and embark on this endeavor, and I shall provide you with the necessary knowledge and resources to see it through. Its success shall depend on your fortitude being greater than that endowed to most mortals.

Recover Light's Vengeance, Arthas' discarded hammer. Combined with saronite, it will provide the foundation for our work.

Pet resilience
We certainly don't think pet resilience is useless. We are considering increasing it to 100% of master's resilience to make up for the increased AE damage pets will take in PvP. We don't want pets to explode on contact neither do we want pet classes to be twice as difficult to kill but we did think it was a little goofy and unintuitive that pets could just shrug off AE attacks in PvP. We'd rather make pets tougher against all types of damage than be vulnerable to some and nearly immune to others. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20122738970-ok-pet-resilience.html
