An interesting change was made to hippogryphs mounts in patch 3.3 .... they finally have ground animations! They will now walk and run just like any other mount.

Quests Datamining - Quel'Delar
There is a lot of speculation going on a few sites based on the Quel'Delar quest chain datamined a few days ago and available on the Database  I figured I should add a few information here. 

First, do not expect a new player legendary item, this is most likely a storyline quest chain to ultimately give back the powerful sword to one of your faction leaders. The chain is as follow :

The Battered Hilt  - Bring the Battered Hilt to Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's rest.
What The Dragons Know  - Speak to Krasus at the top of Wyrmrest Temple, then report your findings to Arcanist Tybalin in the Silver Enclave in Dalaran.
The Sunreaver Plan  - Bring the Sunreaver Orders to Arcanist Tybalin at the Silver Enclave in Dalaran.
A Suitable Disguise  - Obtain a Borrowed Tabard from Shandy Sparkleshine and bring it to Arcanist Tybalin at the Silver Enclave in Dalaran.
A Meeting With The Magister  - Retrieve the Ancient Dragonforged Blades tome for Arcanist Tybalin in Dalaran's Silver Enclave.
Return to Caladis Brightspear  - Bring Ancient Dragonforged Blades to Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's Rest.
Re-Forging The Sword  Provided: Remnants of Quel'Delar  - Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's Rest wants you to obtain 5 Infused Saronite Bars and use the Forgemaster's Hammer to combine them with the Battered Hilt to create the Re-forged Quel'Delar.
Tempering the Blade  Provided: Reforged Quel'Delar  - 
The Halls of Reflection  - Bring your Tempered Quel'Delar to Sword's Rest inside the Halls of Reflection. Return to Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's rest after you have completed your journey.
Journey to the Sunwell  - Speak with Halduron Brightwing at the entrance to the Sunwell Plateau on the Isle of Quel'Danas.
Thalorien Dawnseeker  - Visit Thalorienn Dawnseeker's Remains and obtain his blessing to wield Quel'Delar, then return to Halduron Brightwing near the entrance to the Sunwell.
There is also The Purification of Quel'Delar Vereesa  / The Purification of Quel'Delar Aethas  / The Purification of Quel'Delar Mariel  but for some reasons this quest isn't included in the chain started by The Battered Hilt 

The Argent Crusade version of the description of The Purification of Quel'Delar Mariel  suggests that you will ultimately give the weapon to a NPC. "It may be best to entrust the weapon to the Argent Crusade, where it will serve as a symbol to unite the Lich King's enemies."

Now if you want some real speculation from quests datamining, I suggest that you keep these links bookmarked and check them after each PTR build to see if they are updated :

The Splintered Throne  - Probably related to the Frozen Throne ... and Arthas?
Shadowmourne, Blade of Legends  - Legendary weapon.
Icecrown Citadel Quests on the DB 

One of the quest in the Icecrown Citadel is already available - The Sacred and the Corrupt 

Objective
Place Light's Vengeance and Runeforged Saronite in Highlord Mograine's runeforge in Icecrown Citadel.

Description
It is against my judgment that I present you this errand, <race>, as it will likely end in your undoing.

Ignore my counsel and embark on this endeavor, and I shall provide you with the necessary knowledge and resources to see it through. Its success shall depend on your fortitude being greater than that endowed to most mortals.

Recover Light's Vengeance, Arthas' discarded hammer. Combined with saronite, it will provide the foundation for our work.

Pet resilience
We certainly don't think pet resilience is useless. We are considering increasing it to 100% of master's resilience to make up for the increased AE damage pets will take in PvP. We don't want pets to explode on contact neither do we want pet classes to be twice as difficult to kill but we did think it was a little goofy and unintuitive that pets could just shrug off AE attacks in PvP. We'd rather make pets tougher against all types of damage than be vulnerable to some and nearly immune to others. Source

Infernal and Doomguard
The Infernal and Doomguard have the 90% creature avoidance that other pets do in patch 3.3. Source
