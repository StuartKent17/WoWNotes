Achievements<br>
<br>
Revealing treasure chests while scrying in Nazjatar should now reliably grant credit for Nothing to Scry About.<br>
<br>
<br>
Creatures and NPCs<br>
<br>
Prince Erazmin&apos;s best friend, Scrappy, is now better at traveling Rustbolt to encourage the resistance. He should no longer occasionally fall through the ground.<br>
Unleashed Arcanofiend&#x2019;s Proximal Chaos attacks are now a bit less chaotic.<br>
In Nazjatar, there are now fewer slugs in rocks. Eww.<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Epic gems with a secondary stat now provide 50 of the secondary stat (was 60).<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; note: The power increase of Epic gems over Rare gems is too large, putting players in situations where the right choice is to use a much lower iLvl item with a socket over a Titanforged upgrade. We&#x2019;re making this change before Season 3 begins to limit the number of affected players.<br>
<br>
Fixed a bug that caused some punchcards in the to be labeled &quot;Titanforged&quot; at a lower item level than intended. (No items were harmed in the making of this bugfix.)<br>
Chain Ignitercoil (https://www.wowdb.com/items/168327-chain-ignitercoil) is no longer sold by vendors in Mechagon.<br>
Secret Fish can now be sold, and the sounds they make have been fixed. Don&#x2019;t tell anyone.<br>
Ionized Minnows (https://www.wowdb.com/items/167562-ionized-minnow) can now be stored in the Reagent Bank, as well as Engineering and Fishing Bags.<br>
The following now automatically use reagents stored in your reagent bank:<br>
<br>
Crafting all Junkyard Tinkering blueprints.<br>
Contributing to construction projects.<br>
Using the Charging Station to charge Empty Energy Cells.<br>
<br>
Heart of Azeroth<br>
<br>
The Seething Rage buff from Blood of the Enemy (Essence) will now properly modify the critical damage dealt by any summoned units, such as those summoned by a Shaman or a Monk&apos;s Storm, Earth, and Fire.<br>
Classes with pets that use energy will no longer cause their pets to gain an increased energy regeneration rate when using Memory of Lucid Dreams (Essence).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Missions and Followers<br>
<br>
Fixed an issue where some players could receive the Zen&apos;lan Lost Treasure Map mission a second time with no loot. The mission is now removed if it has already been completed.<br>
Missions with the Deep Sea mechanic now have a base time of 24 hours and are properly countered by Naval Expert.<br>
<br>
<br>
Player vs. Player<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Call to Arms: Nazjatar&#x201D; can now properly be completed by slaying the opposing faction in Nazjatar.<br>
Battle for Nazjatar<br>
<br>
Additional improvements have been made to this event. It should now become active more often, while still ensuring that there are mix of Horde and Alliance players present.<br>
Factions that control more capture points within the Battle for Nazjatar event will now yield more Victory Points. This works similarly to Arathi Basin or the Battle for Gilneas.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Quests<br>
<br>
Reduced the amount of quest items needed to complete many Requisition quests and Bounty daily quests in Nazjatar.<br>
&quot;The Reclamation Rig&quot; construction project will now more reliably give achievement credit to all players who contributed to its construction, even if further away when it is completed.<br>
Players can now see Venture Co. Transport Balloons while &quot;Taking The Air Out&quot;.<br>
&#x201C;The Doppel Gang&#x201D; should now reliably give credit to all players who participate.<br>
Avarius should now spawn as expected once all the Brinestone shards have been placed.<br>
The Zoatroid Harvesters required for &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; now path better, and are more tap friendly, with appropriate health.<br>
<br>
<br>
Support<br>
<br>
Fixed an issue preventing some players from submitting tickets in-game.<br>
Fixed an issue that caused some tickets submitted in-game to incorrectly show as submitted via web.<br>
<br>
<br>
World Quests<br>
<br>
A recent change in diet has made the chitin on glimmershell crab shells more resistant to breaking during combat, resulting in Hefty Glimmershells of usable quality dropping more frequently when you&#x2019;re in &quot;A Steamy Situation&quot;.<br>
The spell intended to recover your corpse during &#x201C;Infestation of Madness&#x201D; no longer incorrectly sends your corpse to Nazjatar.<br>
<br>
<br>
World<br>
<br>
Players should no longer experience phasing issues around the Tidestone in Nazjatar.</div></div>
