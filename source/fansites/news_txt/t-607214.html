European 2v2 Arena Team reaches 3000 Rating<br>
These guys probably won&apos;t have any problem with the season 4 rating requirements changes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=6650.0). The DonLolo z Wladem (http://armory.wow-europe.com/team-info.xml?r=Burning+Legion&amp;ts=2&amp;t=DonLolo+z+Wladem&amp;select=DonLolo+z+Wladem) Team on the EU-Burning Legion server (Bloodlust Battlegroup) reached 3000 Arena Team rating in the 2v2 bracket. Noksil (http://armory.wow-europe.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Burning+Legion&amp;n=Noksil), a human paladin, is the first player to reach 3000 Personal Rating. <br>

US Realms Extended Downtime<br>
Our regularly scheduled Tuesday maintenance will begin at 3:00AM PDT, April 29, and end at approximately 11:00AM PDT. During this time all realms will be down and not accessible for play. <br>
<br>
We will be performing maintenance on the forums on Tuesday April 29, from 5:00AM PDT to 8:00AM PDT. During this time players will not be able to login to the forums but will be able to read them as usual. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html;jsessionid=6BEEDB2F71A672316F13DC5E2CF1A8BB.app09_06?topicId=6214101843&amp;sid=1))<br>
<br>
Tuesday&apos;s maintenance will be an extended one for the US Realms, even if it could be the sign of a 2.4.2 Patch release I wouldn&apos;t really expect it only one week after the deployment of the patch on test servers. However, with the forums down as well, you&apos;ll have plenty of free time and you might want to read the 2.4.2 changes post, it will probably keep you busy for a few minutes.<br>
