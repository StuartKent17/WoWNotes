Dev Interviews<br>
BlizzPlanet (http://warcraft.blizzplanet.com/blog/comments/gamescom-2015-legion-interview-with-tom-chilton-ion-hazzikostas) had the chance to talk to the developers about Legion. New information that wasn&apos;t in other interviews is below:<br>
<br>
<br>
There won&apos;t be another filler patch between Warlords and the Legion invasion, other than the flying patch.<br>
Ruby Sanctum didn&apos;t work out well. It was entertaining for a week or so, as there was one boss to kill and then you were done. <br>
In Warlords, the team didn&apos;t do enough to express the story through in-game content. The garrison campaign wasn&apos;t enough. <br>
One more character slot is being added.<br>
Having one artifact per spec will help to focus the specs. Right now Frost Death Knights can use a two-hand weapon or dual wield, but their artifact is two runeblades, so they will focus on dual-wielding in Legion and Unholy will focus on two-hand weapons.<br>
The new Honor system allows for some new abilities to be added that would have been cut in the past, as they were PvP only.<br>
Draenor&apos;s forces are busy rebuilding Draenor, so they are not going to come and help with the Burning Legion.<br>
Illidan&apos;s storyline will span the entire expansion.<br>
Only allowing elves to be Demon Hunters fits the lore and is the right choice for Legion.<br>
One of the social features under development is notifying you when friends join a queue and allowing you to queue with them.<br>
The team would also like to improve communication across groups. If you have a group of friends you raid with or PvP with there should be a better way to communicate with them.<br>
Older time limited legendary items, such as the Mists of Pandaria cape, may become transmogable.<br>
The sewers of Dalaran were mention as an Order Hall for Rogues again.<br>
Champions will unlock or complement content rather than doing content for you.</div></div>
