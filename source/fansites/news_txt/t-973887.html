Paladin - Censure Hotfix Incoming<br>
After monitoring thousands of Firelands kills, we&apos;ve concluded that Retribution&#x2019;s damage was not where we wanted it to be, so we&apos;re going to increase Censure damage by roughly 40%. We&apos;ll also be keeping an eye on paladin damage as we move towards patch 4.3. We expect that this hotfix should be applied sometime later today.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re also considering shifting some of the damage from Hammer of Wrath into other attacks. While that may not necessarily cure some of the current concerns about proc reliance, it should help smooth out damage a bit. <br>
