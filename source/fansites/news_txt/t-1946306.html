Any insight coming on how mana pools will scale with gear in Legion? Given 1.5x growth planned assume not =ilevel<br>
Mana is generally based on level, not gear (Arcane mage Mastery notwithstanding). (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/694295788302659584))<br>
<br>
Re minor glyphs becoming toys - I hope that this doesn&apos;t mean the permanent visual effects will not become &quot;30 sec every hour&quot;<br>
Purely cosmetic minor glyphs can be applied directly to spells in Legion for a permanent effect, same as today. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/694295753246642177))<br>

PvE<br>
Will &quot;vote kick&quot; and other things like Deserter be revisited in legion?<br>
What are the issues with those systems that you would like to see revisited? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/694286992155095040))<br>
<br>
Hey dudes. No mention of Static Cling in the TW difficulty journal. Could we please get it added? <br>
This will be cleaned up in a future patch. In the meantime, check Heroic difficulty for accurate ability info. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/694296194453909504))<br>

PvP<br>
Are old PvP Ranks going to be Accountwide, so we can transmog the old PvP gear on characters that dont have the rank?<br>
There are no current plans for this. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/694291034226823169))<br>
<br>
will the artifact talents be usable in PvP? I think I read that they won&apos;t and that would suck.<br>
Yep! Artifact traits will be usable in PvP, however, some of these traits may be adjusted when entering PvP combat. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/694294103438131200))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
What was your favorite class in WoW? i&apos;m curious, in world of warcraft is pretty normal to invest a lot of time in one character<br>
Favorite can mean a lot of different things.<br>
<br>
My first class was hunter.<br>
<br>
My first raiding class was Prot warrior (originally 31/5/15 or whatever that was), and that&apos;s when I really fell in love with the game.<br>
<br>
While I worked at Blizzard, I mostly played a priest -- my work schedule got to the point where it wasn&apos;t fair to the group to be main tank -- that&apos;s a position for someone who can show up dependably.<br>
<br>
As a developer, I probably spent the most time on the death knight. That was one of my first real jobs at Blizzard, though I didn&apos;t work on them as much after LK.<br>
<br>
I had a soft spot for paladins as a developer. I always felt there was a ton of potential for the class and I really wanted to see the class design support the rich lore of the world.<br>
<br>
I felt the best designed class was rogue, mostly by virtue of how energy and combo points played together.<br>
