Talents

Warbringer now causes Charge to stun the target used to cause Charge to root a target for 3 seconds, reducing movement speed by 50% for 15 seconds, and generates 20 Rage. Charge's root will *not* cause creatures to turn and attack you like most roots. - Source

Are you going to look at raid buffs and which classes provide them for 6.0?
Yep, there are a few changes planned for that, but not ready to announce details. Most unchanged, just filling in a couple holes. Celestalon 

Can we can get a healer training dummy in WoD? Something we can heal to put us in combat to check trinket procs / weak auras etc
I'll see what we can do. No promises, but I definitely see the value. Celestalon 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Could you make force of nature benefit from eclipse mastery or at least make them do more dmg in solar since they cast wrath?
Depends whether they need it to compete with the other talents on their row. It's something we'll certainly consider. Celestalon 

 Monk Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
why weren't Monks a hero class?
If you mean starting at a high level, because it didn't fit the story we were trying to tell with them. Celestalon 
DKs were existing, powerful characters, that are unleashed on the world, well into their development/history. Celestalon 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
in wod will spriests get a new singel target ability like ms and mb to go with the new singel target talent?
No new abilities, but we are planning to allow the to specialize more for single target, if they choose. Celestalon 
first off im rly glad u are doing the specialization, but spamming ms and mb a whole fight seems abit boring 
If you're referring to Clarity of Power, the rotation is more complex than that. DP, MF, SW: D... Celestalon 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
melee as they follow ABA rule - Always be attacking - white hits are auto. So imp standing around = dps lose plain and simple
The 'ABC Rule', as you call it, is very much true for the vast majority of casters, whose limited resource is time. Celestalon 
The Imp's limited resource is energy, not time. Celestalon 
Imp/Fel imp is a caster therefore they must follow the ABC rule of AAlways BBe C Casting, every caster knows that.
No, they don't. They're an energy-based caster. Their DPS is limited by their energy regen, *not* their cast time. Really. Celestalon 
around. His energy doesn't regein as fast as he can cast, so at some point 2min in he start standing around until he get 40
It sounds like you think that him standing around at all is a DPS loss. It's not. His energy is 100% of his damage. Celestalon 
As long as he's not energy capping, he is doing 100% of his potential DPS. Celestalon 

Will green fire quest chain scaling up for WoD or let it in current lvl so every one will one shot it ? I wote for scale up.
Stay current level. Celestalon 

PvP
More players starting at 90 in WoD will increase BG queue times sub-90. Will BG brackets recombine in WoD e.g. 70-79, 80-89 etc.?
I think we can combine more. The item squish, level and ilevel scaling mean power isn't as varied. holinka 

btw will you ever make it so we don't need to bake /focus arenaX into our macros?
focus is implemented like targeting. If someone stealths, it drops. Will look into it. holinka 

Is it purposeful that my worgen turns into a human when I enter an arena? Finally getting into PVP btw 
Welcome aboard. Arena clears a lot of auras. This is one we probably shouldn't clear. holinka 

Misc
Welp, WarFrame's added to the "doubt I'll play that again" list. Great movement, runs really well, but ugh the crafting/microtransations etc
Personal design interest: when is spending $ in real "fun", when does it suck & what can games learn from that? holinka 
For instance, paying $ for clothes on sale = fun, paying $ to get your passport faster = lame holinka
