Talents

Nerve Strike now causes a successful Kidney Shot or Cheap Shot to also reduce the damage dealt by player targets by 25% down from 50% for player targets. No changes to the talent when used against non-player targets.

General

Charge now pins a target to the ground, rooting the target used to stun the target for 1.5 seconds and generates 20 Rage.

Talents

Warbringer now causes Charge to stun the target used to cause Charge to root a target for 3 seconds, reducing movement speed by 50% for 15 seconds, and generates 20 Rage. Charge's root will *not* cause creatures to turn and attack you like most roots. - Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/429438186083733504




PvP

Gladiator’s Distinction, the set bonus for wearing two PvP trinkets, now grants 5280 Resilience up from 2600.

Are you going to look at raid buffs and which classes provide them for 6.0?
Yep, there are a few changes planned for that, but not ready to announce details. Most unchanged, just filling in a couple holes. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424002066181132288

Can we can get a healer training dummy in WoD? Something we can heal to put us in combat to check trinket procs / weak auras etc
I'll see what we can do. No promises, but I definitely see the value. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424783948263092225

Could you make force of nature benefit from eclipse mastery or at least make them do more dmg in solar since they cast wrath?
Depends whether they need it to compete with the other talents on their row. It's something we'll certainly consider. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424980642162434049

why weren't Monks a hero class?
If you mean starting at a high level, because it didn't fit the story we were trying to tell with them. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424715378334257152
DKs were existing, powerful characters, that are unleashed on the world, well into their development/history. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424715725169651712

in wod will spriests get a new singel target ability like ms and mb to go with the new singel target talent?
No new abilities, but we are planning to allow the to specialize more for single target, if they choose. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424983697960345601
first off im rly glad u are doing the specialization, but spamming ms and mb a whole fight seems abit boring 
If you're referring to Clarity of Power, the rotation is more complex than that. DP, MF, SW: D... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425000905293836289

melee as they follow ABA rule - Always be attacking - white hits are auto. So imp standing around = dps lose plain and simple
The 'ABC Rule', as you call it, is very much true for the vast majority of casters, whose limited resource is time. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424248199780368385
The Imp's limited resource is energy, not time. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424248292419969025
Imp/Fel imp is a caster therefore they must follow the ABC rule of AAlways BBe C Casting, every caster knows that.
No, they don't. They're an energy-based caster. Their DPS is limited by their energy regen, *not* their cast time. Really. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424247563512864768
around. His energy doesn't regein as fast as he can cast, so at some point 2min in he start standing around until he get 40
It sounds like you think that him standing around at all is a DPS loss. It's not. His energy is 100% of his damage. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424240770774601728
As long as he's not energy capping, he is doing 100% of his potential DPS. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424240896335298560

Will green fire quest chain scaling up for WoD or let it in current lvl so every one will one shot it ? I wote for scale up.
Stay current level. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/424983060765868032

PvP
More players starting at 90 in WoD will increase BG queue times sub-90. Will BG brackets recombine in WoD e.g. 70-79, 80-89 etc.?
I think we can combine more. The item squish, level and ilevel scaling mean power isn't as varied. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/424642604710363136

btw will you ever make it so we don't need to bake /focus arenaX into our macros?
focus is implemented like targeting. If someone stealths, it drops. Will look into it. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/424629912129912832

Is it purposeful that my worgen turns into a human when I enter an arena? Finally getting into PVP btw 
Welcome aboard. Arena clears a lot of auras. This is one we probably shouldn't clear. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/424616166040932352

Misc
Welp, WarFrame's added to the "doubt I'll play that again" list. Great movement, runs really well, but ugh the crafting/microtransations etc
Personal design interest: when is spending $ in real "fun", when does it suck & what can games learn from that? holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/425059862859362304
For instance, paying $ for clothes on sale = fun, paying $ to get your passport faster = lame holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/425060181869735936
