Blue Tweets<br>
One of the tweets notes the change (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/133767-lucent-stormforge-ring#20810-20914) to remove Strength, Agility, and Int from the few Legion necks, rings, and cloaks that have been added so far.<br>
Classes<br>

With all the mobility in Legion for other casses some additional gap closer for DKs would be great. <br>
Not every class should be highly mobile. That being said, check out the &quot;Death&apos;s Flight (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/208277-deaths-flight)&quot; talent for Unholy! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/688107350369042433))<br>

Can you clarify if Prot Paladins still hit 5 targets with Avenger&apos;s Shield in Legion?<br>
Avenger&apos;s Shield will hit 3 targets baseline, but there may be ways to increase that number. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/688108659063193601))<br>

Its currently better to not cast lava burst at all on alpha, lightning bolt trumps it in every way.<br>
This isn&apos;t something we are seeing, and it is certainly not intended. Can you share any details? (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/688108788608417792))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
On the alpha, why do rings and necks not have int, strength, or agility on them?<br>
We&#x2019;re experimenting with different designs for how rings, necklaces, and cloaks are itemized. Hang tight for details! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/688106098746769408))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Will there be any customization with stats in PvP left? (e.g. able to spend some of the template on a certain stat)<br>
What type of customization did you do in the past that you liked? Picking a secondary stat to stack? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/688119391494393856))<br>
<br>
Will the new Pvp system in legion be introduce to all levels in the pvp range (starting at level 10)<br>
There will be a chance to win items at the completion of a battleground; similar to dungeons while leveling. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/688134340568432640))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
how important would you say math is to game design? or is it all done by computers now?<br>
Math is very important to systems design. Most designers I work with are reasonably skilled at math, and some are experts. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687365750256877568))<br>
If you are building levels, narrative or maybe UI, math is less essential. Anything that involves combat is inherently numbers. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687365974064893952))<br>
I&apos;d add that you&apos;re gonna need good, solid, time-tested vector math if you want anything moving on screen.<br>
It depends how your studio divides design work and engineering work. Math is part of almost all engineering. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687373680867848192))<br>
If you&apos;re making UI and you want stuff moving around and feeling interactive, math looms ahead!<br>
That may be. I designed a lot of UI for AoE and WoW and never used a calculator. I did for classes and items. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687373528019013632))<br>
