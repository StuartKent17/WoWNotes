Boubouille2007-03-21, 11:25 PMWoWModelViewer got updated to v0.5.08. Check out their website  to download it.
The most important changes are :


Can now automatically import characters from Blizzards armory site by goto Options -> Import Armoury Character and pasting the URL. Please note that character specifics line hair style, skin/hair colour, etc are not imported. Just Race / Gender / Items.
Pushing Control+F1-F3 now temporarilly saves a models poisition, rotation, and the Field of View at the time. To restore this data you can do so by pushing F1-F3 without Control.
Yup, you can now import models from the Armory.

If you're interested, you can get my custom npcs.csv here , it doesn't change much things, it just adds most of the Karazhan bosses and Serpentshrine bosses to the NPC list File > View NPC, Lady Vashj model is available in the Creature > Ladyvashj directory, the Lurker Below is just above and is named Krakken.
