Hunter Pets now inherit 60% of the Hunter&apos;s Attack Power (up from 33%). The buff doesn&apos;t seem to affect basic attacks,intended?<br>
Yes. Basic attacks&apos; damage are based on the master&apos;s AP. (Odd, I know.) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/528236097994625024))<br>

PvP<br>
can you please explain why the candles would be removed from ruins of lordaeron especially in a LAN setting? MAP placement not rel?<br>
We removed some candles that people complained about getting stuck on frequently. Is that what you mean? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/527631178300272640))<br>
why remove map based skill? Why create turret classes? Is there a serious pvp meta response?<br>
I don&apos;t agree that janky collision is map based skill. They were just annoying. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/527663294304497664))<br>
<br>
please don&apos;t force us into randoms for maximum honor. 6.0.2 was great because we got to choose BGs we liked w/o missing add. honor<br>
If specific battlegrounds give as much honor as random battlegrounds, we end up with queue time problems. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/527872232312172544))<br>
<br>
What about a pvp equivalnt of dungeon journal that people new to pvp could read brief synopsis or basic start for the BG they&apos;re in<br>
Yes this is something we&apos;d like to do. Really like the Heroes loading screens. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/527934750011301888))<br>

Lore<br>
I can&apos;t find an answer to this anywhere, how to Night Elves get their facial tattoos (the process) and what does each shape mean?<br>
We&apos;ve never specified anywhere in the lore, to my knowledge. In general they represent a close tie with the natural world. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/528283325967106048))<br>

<br>
Garrisons<br>
Quick question that is VERY important. Can you have a level 3 plot on a level 2 Garrison if you have mats and blueprints? Thanks!<br>
Nope, level 3 plots require level 3 garrison, just like needing a castle to build a gryphon roost in Warcraft. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/528219848355348481))<br>

Blizzard is marking the 10-year anniversary of World of Warcraft&#x2019;s launch with awesome events in three major cities across Europe. If you can make it to central Paris, London, or Berlin on November 22 you&#x2019;ll have the chance to attend and be part of the celebration. You&#x2019;ll be able to mix with fellow players, well-known fan sites, and Blizzard staff, take part in fun activities including WoW dance and costume contests, win cool prizes, have unique photo opportunities to show your WoW pride, and much more&#x2026; Of course, there will also be drinks and birthday cake!<br>

<br>
Each venue has strict capacity limits so it&#x2019;ll be first-come, first-served. If we don&#x2019;t have enough room for everyone who wants to enter, we&#x2019;ll do our best to reward your WoW passion even if you can&#x2019;t get in. <br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll update this blog post in the coming days with final details of event timing and locations, and there&#x2019;ll be dedicated forum threads to answer your questions. For now, gather your guild-mates, get your WoW costume ready, practice your dance moves, polish your party axe, and mark November 22 on your calendar!<br>
