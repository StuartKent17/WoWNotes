Sunwell Plateau will be the next 25 Man raid. And if I understand correctly it will also come with a 5-man dungeon (including heroic mode). You can read the full interview on Actiontrip.com (http://www.actiontrip.com/features/gc2007worldofwarcraftwrathofthelichking.phtml)<br>
<br>
And, also, this is something we haven&apos;t really talked about, so this is somewhat of an exclusive for you guys; Sunwell Plateau, which is an upcoming patch just before Wrath of the Lich King, we&apos;ve announced that it&apos;s gonna have a 25 person raid instance. We will also be doing a 5 person instance which will have both Normal and Heroic mode.<br>

Naxxramas<br>
Also, in an interview with eGames.de (http://www.egames.de/?ren=news_detail&amp;news_id=65631), Tigole confirmed that Naxxramas will be the first 25 man raid of Northrend. He also confirmed a few things :<br>
Some encounters will be totally retuned to fit 25 man raids (4 Horsemen for example). <br>
Tier 3 Armor models will probably be reused</div></div>
