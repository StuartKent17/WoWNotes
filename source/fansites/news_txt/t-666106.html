The latest PTR patch added a few companion pets to the game and it seems that I forgot to post screenshots for a few of them. Sadly, we don&apos;t have the drop locations for most of them and we&apos;ll have to discover that later on live servers. <br>
<br>
Update - Fixed a stupid error, let&apos;s pretend that we didn&apos;t see it. <br>
<br>
Spectral Tiger Cub (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49343/spectral-tiger-cub/) will be a reward of the upcoming Trading Card expansion &quot;Scourgewar&quot;. <br>
Onyxia Whelpling (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69002/onyxian-whelpling/) will be given away to anyone in game during the 5th anniversary of World of Warcraft.<br>
Pandaren Monk (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69541/pandaren-monk/) drop location is unknown but we might have a hint before the end of the PTRs. <br>
Lil&apos; KT (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69677/lil-k-t/) drop location is unknown.<br>
Zipao Tiger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69539/zipao-tiger/) drop location is unknown. <br>
Wind Rider Cub (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69536/wind-rider-cub/) drop location is unknown. (Please note that the model is not textured for the moment)<br>
Gryphon Hatchling (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69535/gryphon-hatchling/) drop location is unknown. <br>
<br>
I&apos;ll count all the &quot;Aaaawww .... Cute!&quot; comments in this news at the end of the day. <br>
