Super quick news post about the server issues. <br>
We&apos;re aware that many players are currently receiving the message &quot;Login Server Busy, Please Try Again&quot; whenever attempting to log into World of Warcraft. While we don&apos;t have an ETA for when this issue will be resolved, we&apos;re looking into it at this time and hope have everyone back in the game as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, in order to keep reports consolidated, we ask that you please keep posts related to this login issue in this thread. Duplicate threads will likely be locked and redirected here, or deleted completely.<br>

Thanks for your patience! As updates become available, we&apos;ll provide them in this thread. :)</div></div>
