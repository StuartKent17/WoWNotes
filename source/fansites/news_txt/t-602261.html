The original post by Hortus was updated, it seems there will be a small delay before we get the 2.2.2 patch on the PTR, we can expect something released in a few hours tor .. a few days if they don&apos;t want to run tests on week end. You can watch the good old Magic Broom flying mount video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bDyp8H3_oo) while you wait. ^^<br>
We will be putting up the 2.2.2 PTR realms later this afternoon. The 2.2.2 Patch will contain new holiday content for October, first we intend to test Brewfest and then later Hallows-End, but this may change depending on our testing needs. There will be pre-mades and character copies for 2.2.2. The character copy process has not started yet but will shortly.<br>
<br>
Update: The PTR is experiencing technical difficulties and may be delayed.<br>

Zones diversity in WotLK<br>
This post might make the &quot;omg Northrend will be full of ice&quot; people happy, but of course, we can&apos;t really know until the expansion is released. <br>
In general we don&apos;t want anybody to walk into a zone and say &quot;oh, another one of these zones&quot;. One of the best things the zones in the game are their diversity. Some zones may share similarities, but we want them all to have a unique feeling as well for players to enjoy.<br>

Blizzcon 2007<br>
Blizzcon news ? Really ? Yes, rly. The official site has been updated with professional photos (http://www.blizzard.com/blizzcon07/gallery.shtml#g11.0) of the event and it&apos;s worth a look if you couldn&apos;t be here. I also noticed that a small Blizzcon video (http://www.wow-europe.com/en/downloads/movies.html#blizzconhighlights) has been added to the official site, didn&apos;t notice it in the first place because it was released simultaneously with the Laments of the Highborne.<br>
