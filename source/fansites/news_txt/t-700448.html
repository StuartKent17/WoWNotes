A new build has been deployed on test realms. So far it doesn&apos;t look like there are a lot of changes out there but stay tuned, test realms can be full of surprises! <br>
<br>
Pets / Mounts<br>
Lil&apos; XT (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75906/lil-xt/) finally got its own model, the name is VERY similar to Lil&apos; K.T. (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69677/lil-k-t/) and it wouldn&apos;t be surprising to see this pet appear on the Blizzard Store at some point. <br>
