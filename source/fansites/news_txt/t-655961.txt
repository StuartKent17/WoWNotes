We thanks millions of Chinese wow players for your support. Nothing is impossible when we are together! We also thank Taiwan wow players for your tolerance and understanding. Hope we can share our honors with you.

Too bad that wowprogress.com will miss the world No.1 guild points-wise only, we respect Ensidia and thank Meka for those courteous comments for days or even weeks. Hopefully there won't be another one-week-delay for the next patch so we can compete with best guilds in the world on every boss rather than those hardest ones only.

We are the Stars! Source http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=72355.0

A video and WMO/WWS logs should be available shortly.

Official Patch Notes Update
The official notes have been updated to reflect the changes in this build.
PvP
Lake Wintergrasp
Wintergrasp factories can no longer be damaged or destroyed.

Dungeons and Raids
Dungeon and Raid ID Extensions
In order to allow for parties and raids to progress through instances at their own pace, players can now extend a dungeon or raid ID on an individual basis.
Existing or recently expired IDs can be extended via the Social tab under Raid by clicking on Raid Info.
The ID of any instance to which a player is saved can be extended. Doing so will extend the lockout period by the same amount of time as the original lockout i.e. extending an Ulduar raid ID will add 7 days, a Heroic: Halls of Lightning dungeon ID will add 24 hours, and a Zul'Gurub raid ID will add 3 days to the lockout time.
An ID can be extended more than once.
An extension can be reversed on an individual basis provided the player does not do anything in the instance during the extended lockout period that would save that player to the instance.

Items: General
Agility: The amount of agility required per percentage of dodge has been increased by 15%. This change required recalibrating the amount of dodge a player has with 0 agility by a slight amount as well, so all players will see their dodge percentage vary a small amount.
Dodge Rating: The amount of dodge rating required per percentage of dodge has been increased by 15%. This is before diminishing returns. Combined with other changes, this makes dodge rating and parry rating equally potent before diminishing returns apply.
Parry Rating: The amount of parry rating required per percentage of parry has been reduced by 8%. This is before diminishing returns. Combined with other changes, this makes dodge rating and parry rating equally potent before diminishing returns apply. Parry still diminishes more quickly than dodge.

Protection
Ardent Defender: Redesigned. Any damage that takes the paladin below 35% health is reduced.
