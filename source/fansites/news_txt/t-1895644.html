World of Warcraft: Legion - World and Content Overview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5251-World-of-Warcraft-Legion-World-and-Content-Overview) (Official Recap (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/392490-world-of-warcraft-legion-world-and-content-panel/))<br>
<br>
The Broken Shore has a 20 Alliance and 20 Horde (40 Player) scenario that begins right after the cinematic. <br>
Demon Hunters have a unique starting experience involving Illidan, who creates a Felsaber epic mount for you.<br>
There are four leveling zones that can be done in any order, as they scale. <br>
There will be endgame world questing content that aren&apos;t strictly daily quests.<br>
Legion will have two raids, one with 7 bosses (Emerald Nightmare) and one with 10 (Suramar Palace) with Gul&apos;dan as the final boss.<br>
Legion Challenge Mode dungeons keep becoming harder as you defeat them and the rewards keep getting better. Complements or replaces raiding.<br>
<br>
World of Warcraft Cinematics - The Road to Legion (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5252-World-of-Warcraft-Cinematics-The-Road-to-Legion)<br>
Misc<br>
<br>
We got our first glimpse of Legion armor sets (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5254-Legion-Armor-Sets-Transmog-System-Community-Amphitheater-Discussion).<br>
The Diablo 3 inspired transmog system (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5254-Legion-Armor-Sets-Transmog-System-Community-Amphitheater-Discussion) coming to WoW will include tabards.<br>
There was a Community Amphitheater Discussion (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5254-Legion-Armor-Sets-Transmog-System-Community-Amphitheater-Discussion) that wasn&apos;t on the Virtual Ticket. Lots of good info, so be sure to read the recap.<br>
World of Warcraft: Legion - Game Systems (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5257-World-of-Warcraft-Legion-Game-Systems)<br>
<br>
Artifact power comes from quest bosses, rare spawns, rare drops, dungeons, raids, battlegrounds, arenas. Used to unlock traits.<br>
Hunters and Druids get special transportation networks in their halls, warriors have a sparring arena. <br>
Class themed Death Gate style spells to get to your class hall.<br>
Talents will have less theme rows, more meaningful choices, more spec specific talents, hundreds of new talents!<br>
Recipes have ranks, 1-3 star recipes. Rare, make you more efficient at crafting things. Less materials, shorter cooldown.<br>
Lots of things to do with professions, shouldn&apos;t be running out of content.<br>
Transmog - Clean up bank and inventory some more. More customization. A collection system.<br>
Wardrobe - As soon as item is bound to you, appearance is unlocked. Once it is unlocked, you can get rid of it. Account wide! Have to be able to equip item to unlock it.<br>
Outfits - Make item sets, store what you look like now, link outfits to other people even if everything isn&apos;t unlocked.<br>
Hiding shoulders allowed!<br>
Weapon enchants, shirts, and tabards for transmog! <br>
<br>
World of Warcraft Q&amp;A (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5259-World-of-Warcraft-Q-A)<br>
<br>
The flying achievement will exist at launch, but you won&apos;t be able to complete it at launch. You can start progressing on it though.<br>
A solution won&apos;t make it for launch, but some way to communicate with a cross-server group is something they are working on.<br>
No new battleground, focus is on the new PvP progression system.<br>
It would be ideal if you could be in multiple guilds at some point, one for PvP, one for Raids. Maybe a secondary guild system? Still in progress.<br>
Legion will allow you to use all the specs, no longer limited to dual spec, each spec remembers your action bars and such.<br>
Karazhan will be relevant in Legion. The secrets we need to beat the Burning Legion are in Karazhan. Karazhan could be a 5 player dungeon in Patch 7.1.<br>
<br>

<br>
The team is fixing the boss movement issues in Patch 6.2.3. Thank the engineers! <br>
In Legion healers can do a lot more damage than they could before when you choose to spend globals and resources on it. <br>
You should be able to level as a healer.<br>
The transmog system will include old quests that have been removed<br>
