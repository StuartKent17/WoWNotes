Bornakk on Zul'aman
Zul'Aman does have a fairly steep curve in difficulty, but having only two 10-person dungeons makes it so having a challenge like this in clearing it makes sense. This can also be seen as an example of why having separate progression paths for 10 and 25 person dungeons in Wrath of the Lich King will likely work out better.

This dungeon can also be a pretty clear example of how Badge of Justice gear that you gather from running Karazhan and Zul'Aman can help get a group prepared to take things on. 

When Zul'Aman was released the "bear runs" were designed for players in high-end gear and at the time even they had issues completing it consistently if at all. Keep in mind that the game evolves over time and the players along with it and as they learn the strategies, what to kill, what the best order for things is, it all becomes easier.
