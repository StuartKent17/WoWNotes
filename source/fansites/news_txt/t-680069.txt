The Pilgrim's Bounty world event is now on live servers and I guess it's worth a small Achievements guide. First let's start with the description from the official site 
We invite you to celebrate Pilgrim's Bounty with us. It's a time for reflecting on your journeys and good fortune, sharing plentiful food, and stories with friends. 

You can partake in wonderful Pilgrim's Bounty feasts near major towns by sitting at a Bountiful Table and enjoying the foods you find there.

If you're interested in learning the Pilgrim's Bounty's recipes, speak with an NPC outside any major city. Stuffing and potatoes are easy enough to put in front of a fire, but if you want to cook a turkey, you'll need to catch one first. Unsling your trusty Turkey Shooter and prepare for the hunt.

Bountiful Tables
Bountiful Tables are the centerpiece of the Pilgrim's Bounty celebration. They are tables loaded with food and surrounded by interactive chairs that allow you to eat and share food with other players via the action bar. 

A Bountiful Table is laid out with five different Pilgrim's Bounty foods, one in front of each chair. Each chair has an unlimited supply of one food, and they are conveniently labeled: The Sweet Potato Chair, The Turkey Chair, The Stuffing Chair, The Cranberry Chair, and The Pie Chair. While in a chair, you may eat as much of that food as you like, as well as pass servings of that food to other players sitting in the chairs. Share the bountiful feasts with your friends! 

If you eat five helpings of any single food, you'll gain benefits unique to that food. In addition, if you eat five helpings of every food, you'll gain the Spirit of Sharing which lasts one hour and increases reputation gained by 10%. This is accomplished much faster if you work together with your fellow feasters at passing food to one another.

Completing the A Pilgrim  / H Pilgrim  meta-achievement will reward you with:
Pilgrim Title

Get a Pilgrim's Attire  or Pilgrim's Dress  or Pilgrim's Robe  from one of the daily quests and pay a visit to the hostile capital cities. 


Now Were Cookin' 
Oh god! A cooking achievement! You'll have to spend countless hours farming level 10 monsters to level your cooking on your alts and get this stupid achievement !!!! No, just kidding. Actually, this achievement alone is probably the easiest and most interesting one. 

All the vendors next to the Bountiful Tables sell a Bountiful Cookbook  for 1 silver, this book contains the 5 recipes added to the game with this holiday :

A Recipe: Candied Sweet Potato  / H Recipe: Candied Sweet Potato 
A Recipe: Cranberry Chutney  / H Recipe: Cranberry Chutney 
A Recipe: Slow-Roasted Turkey  / H Recipe: Slow-Roasted Turkey 
A Recipe: Spice Bread Stuffing  / H Recipe: Spice Bread Stuffing 
A Recipe: Pumpkin Pie  / H Recipe: Pumpkin Pie 

All the reagents required for these recipes are sold by the Bountiful Vendors in the various capital cities, this is clearly stated in the yellow text of each item : Tangy Southfury Cranberries  The only exception is the Spice Bread  for Recipe: Spice Bread Stuffing  but this is pretty much the first cooking recipe you learn and the reagents are available from any cooking supplies vendor.

Now the funny part! You don't want to spend hours leveling your cooking? You won't have to. You can level your cooking from 1 to 300 just with these 5 recipes in less than 30 minutes, all the reagents are bought from vendors in capital cities and only cost a few coppers. Yes, Blizzard just love you that much. You will also need Wild Turkey  from the turkeys you hunt in Elwynn Forest or Tirisfal Glades but you will most likely end up with a lot of it ... See below. 


H Pilgrim's Progress  / A Pilgrim's Progress 
Now that you have all your cooking recipes, completing the daily quests shouldn't be a problem. They just require you to bring back 20 units of each food to the quest giver next to the bountiful table. 

H Can't Get Enough Turkey  / A Can't Get Enough Turkey 
H Easy As Pie  / A Easy As Pie 
H We're Out of Cranberry Chutney Again?  / A We're Out of Cranberry Chutney Again? 
H Don't Forget The Stuffing  / A Don't Forget The Stuffing 
H She Says Potato  / A She Says Potato 

Please note that the daily quests aren't random, you have to visit every capital cities to get all of them from the NPCs next to the Bountiful Tables. 


Terrokar Turkey Time 
Well ... Go kill Talon King Ikiss while wearing a Pilgrim's Hat  and a Pilgrim's Attire  or Pilgrim's Dress  or Pilgrim's Robe  All these items are rewards from the Pilgrim's Bounty daily quests. 


Turkey Lurkey 
This one will probably take you a few days, you need Turkey Shooters  from the daily quests rewards to change rogues into turkeys. Using the item will destroy it and you will have to run 8 daily quests to get enough shooters to complete the achievements.




[url=] The Turkinator 
Depending on how many players you have on your server, you will either love or hate this achievement. Your goal is to kill 40 turkeys in a row in Tirisfal Glades or Elwynn Forest, killing a turkey will buff you with one stack of Turkey Tracker  and you have 30 seconds to kill the next turkey, etc ...

Even if it sounds simple, it's fairly easy to run out of turkeys and if you attempt to complete this achievement during prime time you will most likely end up insulting someone.
