Heroes of Azeroth, prepare to embark for an exotic new frontier! World of Warcraft&#xAE;: Mists of Pandaria&#x2122; is launching on September 25, 2012 and you can be ready to play when the servers go live by pre-purchasing the game digitally (http://us.battle.net/en/int). Plus, for the first time ever, players will have the option to upgrade a pre-purchase to the all-new Digital Deluxe Edition which comes with all of the in-game items from the retail Collector&#x2019;s Edition, including a World of Warcraft pet and mount, banner sigil and accent for Diablo&#xAE; III, and Battle.net&#xAE; portraits for StarCraft&#xAE; II.<br>
<br>
Beginning September 25, 2012, World of Warcraft players around the world will be able to set sail for the long-lost continent of Pandaria, where they&#x2019;ll explore forgotten dungeons, vanquish risen evils, and play their part in the Horde-Alliance conflict as it reaches a critical breaking point.<br>
<br>
Whether you plan to level your existing character to 90 or start fresh with a new pandaren monk, it&#x2019;s never too early to begin preparing for your adventure. Simply log in to your Battle.net&#xAE; account (https://us.battle.net/login/en/), and then pre-purchase Mists of Pandaria. You&#x2019;ll then be flagged to automatically download the expansion content prior to release so you&#x2019;ll be ready to go when the game launches.<br>
<br>
During the pre-purchase process, you&#x2019;ll have the option to grab either the Mists of Pandaria Standard Edition (http://blizzard.com/games/mists/) for $39.99 USD or the all-new Digital Deluxe edition (http://battle.net/wow/services/digital-deluxe/) for $59.99 USD -- or, if you snag the standard edition now and decide you want to upgrade to Digital Deluxe later, you&#x2019;ll have the opportunity to do so for an additional $20.<br>
<br>
The Digital Deluxe edition includes a full digital copy of the expansion, as well as a selection of Pandaria-inspired in-game content for World of Warcraft, Diablo III, and StarCraft II. If you&#x2019;re looking for even more plunder, a special Mists of Pandaria Collector&#x2019;s Edition (http://battle.net/wow/services/collectors-edition/) with additional bonus items will also be available exclusively at select retail locations for a suggested retail price of $79.99 USD.<br>
