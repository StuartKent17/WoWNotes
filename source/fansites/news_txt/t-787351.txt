The 2nd part of the Elemental Invasion just went live! I'm still investigating but it looks like we only have 2 extra quests for the moment, don't hesitate to post in comments if you find anything else!

Subduing the Elements

The player receives Earthen Ring Supplies  when the quest starts. It contains Cleansing Totem  and Elemental Sapta 
Drinking Elemental Sapta  allows you to see the elemental spawned around the zone. 
Use Cleansing Totem  and target the elementals to destroy 20 of them. 





         


Tablets of Earth/Fire

Go to the quest location on your map, you will see the Courier and a Mysterious Crystal. You have to click the Mysterious Crystal to defend the courier against the Twilight Seeker.
3 New abilities will appear in your action bar, use them to defeat the elementals spawning from the portals. 
When the Twilight Seeker flies away, just loot the tablets on the ground and bring them back.
