Class Changes
Patch 7.2 makes changes to many classes, including new Artifact Traits. As always, Icy-Veins http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/class-guides has updated class guides!


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/classGuides.png http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/class-guides 


Class MountsclassMount
Check out all of the class mounts on our Class Mounts page http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6265-Patch-7-2-PTR-Build-23436-Class-Mount-Models! Unlocking these mounts is a reward of the eleven week quest campaign that comes with the patch. 


<a href="http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6265-Patch-7-2-PTR-Build-23436-Class-Mount-Models" target="_blank"><img src="http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/classMountsB.jpg" alt="World of Warcraft Class Mounts" /></a>


New Mounts
Class mounts aren't the only new mounts coming in the patch! New PvP mounts, reputation mounts, dungeon, and raid mounts are also being added.


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/newMountsB.jpg http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6482-World-of-Warcraft-Patch-7.2-New-Mounts 


Artifact Changesartifacts
Patch 7.2 adds new Artifact Traits, new Artifact Knowledge ranks, changes Artifact Trait costs, and more! See our Artifact Changes page http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6485-Patch-7.2-Artifact-Changes for all of the details.


Patch 7.2 adds several new traits for players to earn. These are unlocked by a short quest line that varies based on your role. 
The previous final trait with 20 ranks now just has one rank. 
Excess Artifact Power in the previous final trait will be refunded.
The first new trait you purchase helps to make up for the loss of the old final trait, as it grants 10% damage and 10% Stamina. 
Each of your 3 rank traits will have another rank unlocked, allowing you to purchase up to a maximum of 4 ranks.
A new final trait http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/239042-concordance-of-the-legionfall?artifactRank=0&artifactRelic=0&artifactCost=0&artifactActive=0 has been added, this time with 50 ranks. 
The new final trait is effectively a soft cap, as you will have trouble ever earning enough Artifact Power to max it out.

Legion Invasionsinvasions
The Legion's presence continues to grow in Patch 7.2, with invasions occurring around the Broken Isles. 


The invasion begins with a zone being under attack. The skybox, world quests, and the NPCs present are changed in some areas, similar to the pre-expansion invasions. 
The invasion quests are similar to the regular world quests, requiring you to kill NPCs and click objects.
After completing all six invasion world quests, you have completed the Assault on Zone quest http://www.wowdb.com/quests?filter-patch=23436&filter-daily=1&filter-search=Assault, allowing you to move to the next stage.
Next you are sent to a specific point in the zone to defeat more invaders, with some similar followup quests.
After all of these quests are complete, there is a three player invasion scenario that sends you to the Legion ship in the sky.
On the ship you defeat various NPCs before defeating the leader and taking down the ship.

Legendary items are getting some modifications, bad luck protection is becoming spec specific, and you can somewhat target slots for legendary items in Patch 7.2!


Legion Legendary items now require level 101 was 110.
Patch 7.2 makes legendary drop bad luck protection more spec specific.
The system looks at how many legendary items you have that can drop for your spec, so if you switch specs the system will know how many legendary items that work for that spec. If you don't have any for that spec, you will have a higher chance to get one.
The crafted legendary items don't count against your legendary bad luck protection.
You can target a specific slot for legendary items with the Relinquished tokens http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=relinquished from the Broken Shore.

Addons & Friendly Nameplates in Dungeons and Raids
With Patch 7.2, we’re disabling the ability for addons to modify the appearance of friendly nameplates while inside dungeon and raid instances.

While, for the most part, we’re impressed with -- and encourage -- the creativity that addon authors bring to the game using the addon API, occasionally an addon goes too far in terms of automating or trivializing elements of gameplay that are meant to be highly challenging. Recently, we’ve become aware of a couple addons that were using visual adjustments to friendly nameplates as a method to automatically coordinate complex positioning requirements. This caused what was intended to be a difficult test of a group’s ability to identify positioning requirements on the fly to instead become a simple matter of following a visual marker.

In order to prevent this from continuing, we’ve had to disable the ability for addons to modify how friendly nameplates appear while inside of dungeon and raid instances. Nothing has changed outside of dungeons and raids – addons will still be able to customize the appearance of friendly nameplates everywhere else most notably in PvP, where they’re most commonly used in ways we don’t consider problematic. 

We also don’t anticipate that addon authors will need to update their code to accommodate this change; customizations should simply stop working once a player zones into a raid, and start working again once they’ve left. However, if you’d like to double-check, this change should now be active in the current 7.2 PTR environment.

Just to reiterate since I'm seeing some confusion:


Nothing whatsoever is changed while you are outside of a raid or dungeon When you zone into a raid or dungeon, only your friendly nameplates if enabled will be forced to use the standard Blizzard appearance Enemy nameplates can still be modified and customized by addons while in a raid or dungeon Once you zone out of the raid or dungeon, any changes made by an addon will once again apply


Set Appearances Collection

You can filter by PvP/PvE, as well as Collected / Not Collected
Different raid difficulties and PvP difficulties are separated
You can search for dungeon and boss names to list the sets that have pieces from them.
