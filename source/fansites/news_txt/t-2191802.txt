The invasion quests are similar to the regular world quests, requiring you to kill NPCs and click objects.
After completing all six invasion world quests, you have completed the Assault on Zone quest , allowing you to move to the next stage.
Next you are sent to a specific point in the zone to defeat more invaders, with some similar followup quests.

On the ship you defeat various NPCs before defeating the leader and taking down the ship.

Addons & Friendly Nameplates in Dungeons and Raids
With Patch 7.2, we’re disabling the ability for addons to modify the appearance of friendly nameplates while inside dungeon and raid instances.

While, for the most part, we’re impressed with -- and encourage -- the creativity that addon authors bring to the game using the addon API, occasionally an addon goes too far in terms of automating or trivializing elements of gameplay that are meant to be highly challenging. Recently, we’ve become aware of a couple addons that were using visual adjustments to friendly nameplates as a method to automatically coordinate complex positioning requirements. This caused what was intended to be a difficult test of a group’s ability to identify positioning requirements on the fly to instead become a simple matter of following a visual marker.

In order to prevent this from continuing, we’ve had to disable the ability for addons to modify how friendly nameplates appear while inside of dungeon and raid instances. Nothing has changed outside of dungeons and raids – addons will still be able to customize the appearance of friendly nameplates everywhere else most notably in PvP, where they’re most commonly used in ways we don’t consider problematic. 

We also don’t anticipate that addon authors will need to update their code to accommodate this change; customizations should simply stop working once a player zones into a raid, and start working again once they’ve left. However, if you’d like to double-check, this change should now be active in the current 7.2 PTR environment.

Just to reiterate since I'm seeing some confusion:


Nothing whatsoever is changed while you are outside of a raid or dungeon When you zone into a raid or dungeon, only your friendly nameplates if enabled will be forced to use the standard Blizzard appearance Enemy nameplates can still be modified and customized by addons while in a raid or dungeon Once you zone out of the raid or dungeon, any changes made by an addon will once again apply

WoWDB Addon Data Collection
Quickly populating the database with new additions is done with the help of many players. The more people that contribute data, the more accurate and quickly we can update the database.

To help out, just click here curse://enable-wowdb-upload if you have the Twitch Desktop App already installed.

When you are playing the addon will gather data and save it. When you are done playing, Twitch will see the game close and upload the collected data from the addon.
