Boubouille2009-08-17, 11:23 PMUpdate - I also added a version of the image with increased brightness and added the world map of Azeroth over it in another image. The map I used is just a 1680x1050 screenshot of the in-game map and it looks exactly like the one used on SoundBlaster.com

WoW Teaser on Soundblaster.com
A new teaser appeared on the front page of SoundBlaster.com http://www.soundblaster.com/. For the moment it's just a blinking horde logo with the Lament of the Highborne http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/downloads/movies.html#lament playing in the background. I don't think Blizzard would announce anything important through another site and it's most likely just a nice way to release a new piece of hardware but we'll keep an eye on it anyway.
