Patch 4.0.6 on live realms this week
Patch 4.0.6 will be deployed on live realms this week and it's time for a recap of the changes with a couple of highlights.

Patch 4.0.6 Item changes
Epic crafted items get extra gem slots in this patch! No, I didn't forget Dragonkiller Tunic http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/56564/dragonkiller-tunic/ / Assassin's Chestplate http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/56562/assassins-chestplate/ / Belt of Nefarious Whispers http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/56537/belt-of-nefarious-whispers/ / Corded Viper Belt http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/56539/corded-viper-belt/, they just didn't have socket changes on PTRs. 

Also, I have a couple of new tools and making list of item changes isn't as painful as it used to be. I added a list of relevant item changes as well! Relevant = I didn't add all the typo fixes, the low level item changes, the TBC/WotLK Items bugfixes, etc

Lay on Hands http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/633/lay-on-hands/ now causes Forbearance on the target. It used to only cause it when cast on the paladin.
