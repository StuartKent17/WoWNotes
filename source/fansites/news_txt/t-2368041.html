Upgrade Your Account Security and Get a Backpack Upgrade<br>
We take account security seriously, and we know you do, too. So, when you add Blizzard SMS Protect to your account along with either the Blizzard Authenticator (physical or mobile app), you&#x2019;ll gain four extra bag slots&#x2014;account-wide&#x2014;in each character&#x2019;s main backpack. You&#x2019;ll be able to hold a little more stuff as you adventure through Azeroth, and keep that stuff safer from scoundrels and thieves.<br>

<br>
What Is Blizzard SMS Protect?<br>
Blizzard SMS Protect lets you perform certain account actions from your mobile phone (such as removing your Authenticator), and can be set up to provide you with account activity notifications. All you need is a supported text-enabled cell phone to get started.<br>
<br>
What can SMS Protect do for you?<br>
<br>
<br>
Unlock your Blizzard account<br>
Remove a damaged or lost Blizzard Authenticator<br>
Recover your account name<br>
Reset your password<br>
<br>
<br>
In addition, you can turn on alerts to have text messages sent directly to your phone notifying you of certain kinds of account activity, like password changes and security feature additions or removals.<br>
<br>
These text messages are an easy way to help protect your account from unauthorized access and changes.<br>
<br>
Remember, you can further safeguard your account by never sharing your password, using unique passwords on each site you visit, and staying aware of potential email and phishing scams.<br>
<br>

<br>
Where Can I Get the Blizzard Authenticator?<br>
Don&#x2019;t have an Authenticator on your account? Download the free Blizzard Authenticator mobile app for iOS (https://itunes.apple.com/app/blizzard-authenticator/id306862897?mt=8) or Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blizzard.bma), or purchase a physical Blizzard Authenticator from the Blizzard Gear Store (https://gear.blizzard.com/us/catalogsearch/result/index/?cat=126&amp;q=authenticator).

<br>
As an additional bonus, when you add an Authenticator to your account, you&#x2019;ll find the always feisty and fiery Core Hound Pup in-game pet waiting for you.</div></div>
