WoW Token – Additional Details
As many players are aware, there are certain limits in place regarding how many WoW Tokens can be purchased per Battle.net account, both from the in-game Shop and through the Auction House. Today, we’d like to provide a quick update on the current limits to help you better plan your Token purchases. 


A maximum of 10 Tokens per week may be purchased for real money from the in-game Shop, to be sold on the Auction House for gold.
A maximum of 36 Tokens every 24 months may be purchased for gold via the Auction House, to be used for game time.
Players may only have one type of Token in their inventory at one time. If any character on a Battle.net account is currently holding a Token purchased from the in-game Shop, that player will not be able to purchase a Token from the Auction House. Likewise, if any character is holding a Token purchased from the Auction House, that player will not be able to purchase a Token from the in-game Shop.
Players may hold a maximum of 10 Tokens in their inventory at one time. This limit is shared across all characters on the Battle.net account.

NA Qualifier Cup 2 Signups Open
There’s still time to register your team  for the second North American Online Qualifier Cup! Signups will be closing at 8 PM Pacific time 11 PM Eastern on Sunday, July 26.

In order to be eligible, everyone on your team must have reached a 3v3 Arena Ladder rating of at least 2000. What’s more, the higher your ladder rating, the better position you’ll be given when we seed the brackets for the Online Qualifier Cup. We’ll be checking ratings at 10 AM Pacific time 1 PM Eastern on Monday, July 27, so you’ve got until then to get your rating as high as you can!

Remember, two teams will advance to the Americas Regionals in this Online Qualifier Cup. There, eight teams six from North America, one from Latin America, and one from Australia & New Zealand will fight for three chances to continue on to compete at BlizzCon for their share of the $250,000 prize pool.

Of course, you can’t advance if you don’t sign up, so head over to Battlefy  now and register your team.

Warlock Instant CS Macro
Thanks for the report. We're looking into this and hope to have a fix soon.

I've gone ahead and deleted the exploit from the earlier posts in this thread. For future reference, we have the ability to look at previous versions of posts, so if you do need to share information on how an exploit works, you can edit that information out once your post is made and we'll still be able to see it.

Hey can you fix the Noble's Fancy Boots from darkmoon faire vendor to be cosmetic? It's still labelled cloth for some reason.
We hope to have this addressed in an upcoming patch. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
I'm really not supposed to reply on my personal account. Sometimes my enthusiasm gets the best of me and I do. holinka 

Will this new feature allow for crossfaction arenas? Hate being tied to one faction because everyone else is
No, the intent of this feature is to reduce queue times for battlegrounds and Ashran. WarcraftDevs 

.Will certain class/race combos always trigger other races in Merc Mode? ex Troll/Shaman always Dwarf, or will it be random?
You will be changed to a different race based on your class. WarcraftDevs 

considering mercenary mode for rated content? Alot of comic books have horde and alliance fighting on the same side in arenas.
No we are not. holinka 

Garrisons
Failed the naval mission for the Black Market AH item. I thought failed missions could be retried? It's not available anymore
It will come back, but you may have to wait a while. Not all missions reappear immediately if failed. WarcraftDevs 

is there an ETA on fixing the Spirit Lodge/Mage Tower constructs? They haven't worked since 6.2.
This is slated to be addressed in an upcoming patch. WarcraftDevs
