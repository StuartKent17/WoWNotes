We&#x2019;d like to take a moment to dispel some rumors and give some insight into certain &#x201C;hidden&#x201D; Artifact Appearances, as well as some general notes on how this system (and similar systems) has worked out so far in Legion.<br>
<br>
For starters, we&#x2019;ve seen some rumblings around the community that the appearance for Arms Warriors was &#x201C;hotfixed in.&#x201D; This is not the case. The quest for that particular appearance has a daily chance to be offered in the Warrior Order Hall, and when it&apos;s active, it will be active throughout an entire region for that day. Our initial setting for that chance ended up being too conservative (and was increased in Patch 7.1), but the chance has been there every day since the expansion launched. <br>
<br>
Many of you have also been asking about the hidden appearance for Frost Death Knights. We&#x2019;ve been trying to avoid giving out too much in the way of spoilers for these, but as it&#x2019;s now the last one to be discovered, we figured we might as well give you guys a hint. This appearance is tied to a particular world boss, which hasn&#x2019;t spawned yet. Once that boss is available, we expect the appearance to be found pretty quickly.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ve learned a lot of important lessons about hidden content and these sorts of varied and discoverable unlocks over the course of Legion development. Some of our efforts were clearly far more successful than others. We&#x2019;re going to take these lessons to heart and apply them going forward. Additionally, we&#x2019;re working on a few tweaks to how the hidden artifact appearances are acquired, which will be released in a future patch, with the goal of reducing the frustration that can come from trying to chase down some of the more elusive ones.<br>
