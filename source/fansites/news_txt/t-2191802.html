<br>

Class MountsclassMount<br>
Check out all of the class mounts on our Class Mounts page (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6265-Patch-7-2-PTR-Build-23436-Class-Mount-Models)! Unlocking these mounts is a reward of the eleven week quest campaign that comes with the patch. <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
New Mounts<br>
Class mounts aren&apos;t the only new mounts coming in the patch! New PvP mounts, reputation mounts, dungeon, and raid mounts are also being added.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/newMountsB.jpg (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6482-World-of-Warcraft-Patch-7.2-New-Mounts) <br>
<br>
<br>
Artifact Changesartifacts<br>
Patch 7.2 adds new Artifact Traits, new Artifact Knowledge ranks, changes Artifact Trait costs, and more! See our Artifact Changes page (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6485-Patch-7.2-Artifact-Changes) for all of the details.<br>
<br>
<br>
Patch 7.2 adds several new traits for players to earn. These are unlocked by a short quest line that varies based on your role. <br>
The previous final trait with 20 ranks now just has one rank. <br>
Excess Artifact Power in the previous final trait will be refunded.<br>
The first new trait you purchase helps to make up for the loss of the old final trait, as it grants 10% damage and 10% Stamina. <br>
Each of your 3 rank traits will have another rank unlocked, allowing you to purchase up to a maximum of 4 ranks.<br>
A new final trait (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/239042-concordance-of-the-legionfall?artifactRank=0&amp;artifactRelic=0&amp;artifactCost=0&amp;artifactActive=0) has been added, this time with 50 ranks. <br>
The new final trait is effectively a soft cap, as you will have trouble ever earning enough Artifact Power to max it out.<br>
<br>

Legion Invasionsinvasions<br>
The Legion&apos;s presence continues to grow in Patch 7.2, with invasions occurring around the Broken Isles. <br>
<br>
<br>
The invasion begins with a zone being under attack. The skybox, world quests, and the NPCs present are changed in some areas, similar to the pre-expansion invasions. <br>
The invasion quests are similar to the regular world quests, requiring you to kill NPCs and click objects.<br>
After completing all six invasion world quests, you have completed the Assault on Zone quest (http://www.wowdb.com/quests?filter-patch=23436&amp;filter-daily=1&amp;filter-search=Assault), allowing you to move to the next stage.<br>
Next you are sent to a specific point in the zone to defeat more invaders, with some similar followup quests.<br>
After all of these quests are complete, there is a three player invasion scenario that sends you to the Legion ship in the sky.<br>
On the ship you defeat various NPCs before defeating the leader and taking down the ship. <br>

Legendary Item ChangeslegendaryChanges<br>
Legendary items are getting some modifications, bad luck protection is becoming spec specific, and you can (somewhat) target slots for legendary items in Patch 7.2!<br>
<br>
<br>
Legion Legendary items now require level 101 (was 110).<br>
Patch 7.2 makes legendary drop bad luck protection more spec specific.<br>
The system looks at how many legendary items you have that can drop for your spec, so if you switch specs the system will know how many legendary items that work for that spec. If you don&apos;t have any for that spec, you will have a higher chance to get one.<br>
The crafted legendary items don&apos;t count against your legendary bad luck protection.<br>
You can target a specific slot for legendary items with the Relinquished tokens (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=relinquished) from the Broken Shore.<br>

PvP Brawl: Southshore vs. Tarren Mill - Originally introduced as a part of the World of Warcraft 10-Year Anniversary event, this Brawl harkens to the early days of WoW PvP with an epic battle between the two towns of Tarren Mill and Southshore<br>

You can see the full list of UI changes in the official notes, but we&apos;ve highlight some of the more important ones below! <br>
<br>
<br>
The Blood of Sargeras vendor now sells items in multiple amounts (Shift-click).<br>
The calendar now shows ongoing events (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/ongoingEvent.jpg) when you hover over a day.<br>
Vendors now grey out the price (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/currencyGrey.jpg) when you don&apos;t have a sufficient amount of currency. <br>

<br>
Addons &amp; Friendly Nameplates in Dungeons and Raids<br>
With Patch 7.2, we&#x2019;re disabling the ability for addons to modify the appearance of friendly nameplates while inside dungeon and raid instances.<br>
<br>
While, for the most part, we&#x2019;re impressed with -- and encourage -- the creativity that addon authors bring to the game using the addon API, occasionally an addon goes too far in terms of automating or trivializing elements of gameplay that are meant to be highly challenging. Recently, we&#x2019;ve become aware of a couple addons that were using visual adjustments to friendly nameplates as a method to automatically coordinate complex positioning requirements. This caused what was intended to be a difficult test of a group&#x2019;s ability to identify positioning requirements on the fly to instead become a simple matter of following a visual marker.<br>
<br>
In order to prevent this from continuing, we&#x2019;ve had to disable the ability for addons to modify how friendly nameplates appear while inside of dungeon and raid instances. Nothing has changed outside of dungeons and raids &#x2013; addons will still be able to customize the appearance of friendly nameplates everywhere else (most notably in PvP, where they&#x2019;re most commonly used in ways we don&#x2019;t consider problematic). <br>
<br>
We also don&#x2019;t anticipate that addon authors will need to update their code to accommodate this change; customizations should simply stop working once a player zones into a raid, and start working again once they&#x2019;ve left. However, if you&#x2019;d like to double-check, this change should now be active in the current 7.2 PTR environment.<br>
<br>
Just to reiterate since I&apos;m seeing some confusion:<br>
<br>
<br>
Nothing whatsoever is changed while you are outside of a raid or dungeon When you zone into a raid or dungeon, only your friendly nameplates (if enabled) will be forced to use the standard Blizzard appearance Enemy nameplates can still be modified and customized by addons while in a raid or dungeon Once you zone out of the raid or dungeon, any changes made by an addon will once again apply<br>
<br>
<br>
Set Appearances Collection<br>
A new tab has been added to the collections pane that lists Tier armor sets and PvP sets.<br>
<br>
<br>
You can filter by PvP/PvE, as well as Collected / Not Collected<br>
Different raid difficulties and PvP difficulties are separated<br>
You can search for dungeon and boss names to list the sets that have pieces from them.<br>
