Addon - HandyNotes Legion Rares and Treasures<br>
Now is a good time to install the Legion plugin (https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/handynotes_legionrarestreasures) for HandyNotes (https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/handynotes)! It includes not only the rares and treasures in the Broken Isles, but the ones in the Demon Hunter starting area as well. <br>

Addon - Camera Zoom Fix<br>
This addon (https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/stop-reseting-my-camera-please) sets the camera zoom distance to max every time you log in, saving you from having to manually enter the console command and fix your zoom level until a patch stops the resetting. <br>

Legion Release and Events<br>
this isn&apos;t fair for us in europe..we have to wait more and avoid spoilers..SHAME!<br>
Unlocking everything requires a maintenance, alas. But the roles will be reversed in 21 days... (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/763052180442001409))<br>
so you mean there will be no time difference?<br>
Legion unlocks in Europe ~9 hours before it does in NA, since it&apos;s the 30th there before it is here. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/763056591293648896))<br>
<br>
is Dalaran event going to be available after aug 30 or only those who log in on launch day will be part of it?<br>
Everything is available after 8/30 except demon invasions. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763042296119955456))<br>
including all broken shore questline? I thought they weren&apos;t going to be available after 8/3! thanks!<br>
They are shortcut so you can get into BI faster, but you can go back and do everything by talking to Archivist Elysiana in Dalaran (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763042773742161920))<br>
<br>
Wasn&apos;t the quest with Jaina leaving Dalaran supposed to be today, or am I wrong?<br>
Next week (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763108300078538752))<br>
<br>
Ravika (5.3 vendor) only spawns for lvl 100+ Horde on Broken Shore quest - Alliance can&apos;t get cosmetic shoes. Intended?<br>
Horde also get Fo&apos;rum the Postmaker, Alliance get a Lucky Shirt vendor and Alaina&apos;s Bonnet (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763146384472104960))<br>
Note to Horde players: Fo&apos;rum&apos;s posts are not bound, sell an angry post to an Alliance player today! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763166827904061440))<br>
<br>
The limited time items: anything for Nethershards, Invasion weapons (looking in to the drop rate), Pocket Fel Spreader. That&apos;s it. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763237523392831488))<br>
Pocket Fel Spreader will be unattainable for those of us who preordered physical CE rather than digital right? Can&apos;t afford both <br>
Nope! Anyone can fight an ousted Dreadlord. You just need to be able to locate demons (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763240122443706370))<br>
<br>
DO demon invasions get harder as Legion gets closer? or just more common?<br>
Intensity increases by 300% each week (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763242903309168640))<br>
<br>
Are you required to do the Broken Shores scenario before starting Legion? Or can you skip it on your alts and go into the action?<br>
.After 8/30, once you&apos;ve seen Dalaran teleport, you can skip everything on your alts and go right to dalaran and start artifacting (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763426018279370752))<br>
any way to get nethershard vendor now on alts without doing broken shore 11 more times?<br>
Illidari vendors should be present in all zones where invasions occur all the time with the goods. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763445911364116480))<br>
<br>
Camera<br>
Any updates regarding the zoom speed bug? I&apos;m currently playing like this to avoid the worst of it:<br>
It isn&apos;t a bug but a deliberate change. It&apos;ll take a future patch to introduce a CVar to allow fine-tuning of adjustment speed. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/763413605844865025))<br>

Legion - Mechanized Lumber Extractor<br>
The Mechanized Lumber Extractor (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140500-mechanized-lumber-extractor) mount is a reward of the Remember to Share (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11176-remember-to-share) achievement for collecting 300 toys. If you don&apos;t want to collect all of those toys, the Sky Golem (http://www.wowdb.com/items/95416-sky-golem) is a very similar option. <br>
