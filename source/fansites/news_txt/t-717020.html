<br>
General<br>
The Ruby Sanctum, an all-new 10- and 25-player raid featuring normal and Heroic difficulties, is now available for testing! Players will find the dungeon entrance below Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight.<br>
Copied Test Realm characters are not copied with their achievement history in order to better facilitate the character copy process.<br>
<br>
<br>
User Interface<br>
Chat Frame<br>
Players can now right-click on any chat type (Whisper, Trade, General, Party, Raid, etc.) and choose the Pop Out Chat option. This will move that chat type to a separate tab in the Chat frame which can be undocked and moved anywhere on the screen.<br>
Using the Pop Out Chat option on a Whisper will place the conversation with that player in a separate tab.<br>
Any time a conversation with another player is put into its own tab, the tab will glow when a new message is received.<br>
Hovering over the Chat Frame and using the mouse wheel will allow players to scroll through chat text.<br>
Players can select Classic Mode under Interface Options to keep the Chat Frame functionality closer to what it was prior to patch 3.3.5.<br>
The Simple Chat User Interface option has been removed.<br>
<br>
Friends List<br>
A new icon has been added to the top left of the Chat Frame which will open up the Friends list.<br>
In addition to its current functionality, the Friends List will now allow players to add Battle.net accounts (Real ID). Players will have to confirm that they are friends in order for a Real ID to be added. Once Real ID friends, players can communicate cross-game, cross-faction and cross-realm.<br>
A new Pending tab has been added where players can accept or decline a Real ID friend request, or select the Report Spam or Block Communications buttons.<br>
Players can now select from three statuses which will be visible to their friends: Available, Away and Busy.<br>
A Broadcast window has been added to the top of the frame. Players can use this to broadcast a message to all of their Real ID friends online. This message will also be displayed under the broadcaster&#x2019;s Real ID information in each friend&#x2019;s list.<br>
