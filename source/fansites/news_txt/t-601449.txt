For the Horde http://www.for-the-horde.eu/forum/ killed Illidan and got a new caster trinket, the effect when you use it is ... interesting. 

The other interesting thing with this trinket is the fact that it doesnt share cooldown with other trinkets, you can activate it, and use another damage trinket simultaneously. 
Cooldown is 2 minutes.
