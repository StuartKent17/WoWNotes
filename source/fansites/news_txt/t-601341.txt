Boubouille2007-06-02, 02:11 AMDuring Phase 2 of the Lady Vashj encounter in Serpentshrine Cavern, there was a significant chance that a Coilfang Strider could spawn at a particular point that would cause the creature to evade. The Strider evading would then reset the entire encounter prematurely. We've made a modification to the spawn point that should prevent this behavior. 
During Phase 2 of the Al'ar encounter in Tempest Keep, Al'ar occasionally charges at a random player. The damage dealt by the Charge was severe enough to immediately kill a lightly armored target even if the player was at full health. We've reduced the damage done by this Charge ability. 

Totally unrelated, I added a map to the Skyguard Reputation Guide http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=253, not watermarked, you can use it anywhere. Will probably add a few things to it later, feel free to mention anything missing in comments.
