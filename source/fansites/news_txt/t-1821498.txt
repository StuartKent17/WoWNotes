Patch 6.2 - I Found Pepe! Or Not!
Everyone's <span title="or least favorite">favorite bird</span> got some new costumes and an achievement I Found Pepe! http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10053-i-found-pepe in Patch 6.2. 

Interestingly, we haven't come across anyone with the achievement yet. There also have been no new Pepe NPCs http://www.wowdb.com/npcs?filter-search=pepe added to the database so far.

So far, 1.31% of players have the What A Strange, Interdimensional Trip It's Been http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9838-what-a-strange-interdimensional-trip-its-been achievement, up from 0.41% when we checked back in May.

Blue Tweets
Lore
Probably dark shamans were in training until 5.3. Reasons similar to why he used other Horde races, I guess.
Garrosh got crazier and more xenophobic after he brought the heart back to Org, influence of the old god Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/619937476145053700
didn't say he was immune due to the Divine Bell or some other Mogu method?
Divine Bell was destroyed during Breath of Darkest Shadow iirc Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/619940930154446848
yes, but unless I misread the tweet, it was said that caused Garrosh to wield the heart without corruption
He didn't get corrupted... at first. OG's can still mess with you mentally, e.g. your heart will explode. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/619949064717664256

Hey Muffinus, I recall you stating that fel magic uses souls, so would fel magic be both a form of chaos magic and soul magic?
Some chaos magic does, some doesn't, some shadow magic does, some doesn't, it's like a reagent for some spells, e.g. Soulburn. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/619952369724362752

Reputation / Questing
Personal, frequent, weekly story helps hide the grind. Is that difficult to include, and might we expect more next expansion?
Ah, I normally try to avoid game specifics like that. I don't want my personal twitter to be another source of WoW news. craig_amai https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/619732666338795520
Yeah, we love making the more crafted story pieces to punctuate the max-level experience. We're aimed at more and better. craig_amai https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/619732737180590080
Difficult might not be the right word, but it's fair to say that they take time, so there are limits to how many we can craft. craig_amai https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/619732830801637376


Ghostcrawler Tweets
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Developer Communication
Why is the person it's easiest to get answers from regarding past and present WoW design philosophies someone who no longer works for the company and should be answering Qs from a much larger player base about an entirely different game?
I answer the questions I get. I think a lot of WoW players still know who I am and League players are still discovering how to reach me. I'd much prefer to talk about League. 

is communication from one person on a big game design team better or easier for designers interacting with players?
Personally, I think it's better when everyone communicates. That's the Riot strategy. I think it feels authentic to players OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610819080019275777
I can also see why some prefer to use one person. Keeps other people from saying stuff you shouldn't say. But that also puts
My entire department is encouraged, if not required, to get out there and talk to players. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610821104597233664
I'd rather just clarify when someone errs than have a system designed to be so rigid that nobody ever makes a mistake. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610820694461448194

Game Design
"I could stay after work and make this a good game... Naaaaah." *faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaart*
It's typically more "I could fix this UI bug that happens in 0.5% of 5 year old graphic cards or I could add a new feature." OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610510409712340993

My professional opinion is that success has less to do with features and more to do with where the players are. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/605824062678392834
Right because players just mindlessly migrate, they don't care about things like "features." God you are thick.
It's not mindless at all. They tend to go where their friends are, and the switching cost of large groups of friends is high. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610511011406188544
This is not restricted to video games. History is full of better products that couldn't convince users to convert to them. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610511164011737090
OTOH, users will convert to new things that they didn't know they needed before. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610511280185552896
So my point was 'tis better to create a new niche than to try and shove someone out of an existing one. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610511394413285376

Do you think the constant queueing up and convenience system that WoW has now is better for an MMO? Should travelling exist?
I have a love/hate relationship with queueing for any game, even League. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610819394956996610
Queuing provides an easy excuse not to make or play with friends. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610819606962253824
It also gives players motivation not to resolve problems since everyone is replaceable. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610819895106777088
And yet! So few players would play a game like League or WoW if we forced them to manually build a group. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610820023884513280
I know that's a cop out answer but I think about this a lot. At best you can provide better rewards for premades. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610820224946847744
Yet premades already come with a lot of inherent bonuses and it's still often too inconvenient. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610820368006184960

At the time you left WoW, comparing to the WoTLK days, was there a difference in the level of passion that the blizzard game designers had? I feel that over time they have grown less passionate and even complacent, and the result glaringly shows in WoD.
I didn't notice a difference in passion from my point of view. Those guys pour their soul into their work. I'm not up to speed on the design so I really don't feel like I can comment, but I wouldn't try to interpret it as the developers not caring. They care very much. Disappointing you kills them.
