The main phase of the Zombie Invasion has now started !
The infection now lasts 2 minutes instead of 5
Necropolis from the pre-Naxxramas events are back throughout the world ! The undeads are everywhere ! The pre-naxxramas mini-boss in Stratholme Balzaphon is also back and still drops his level 60 gear
The quest to kill Tenris Mirkblood http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=22901.0 is now available at the Light's Hope Chapel and in most of the major cities !
You cannot kite huge packs of undead anymore, they now have a debuff to reduce your speed by 50%.
