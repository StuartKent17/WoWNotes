<br>
Coming in Patch 4.3.2 - Cross-Realm Raids<br>
We previously introduced the ability to form cross-realm parties with Real ID friends (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/190952-new-real-id-party-feature-now-live/), and now with Patch 4.3.2, we&apos;re adding the ability for players to use that same functionality to form raids to run older normal or heroic raids, or participate in Battlegrounds!<br>
<br>
This will allow you to join up with your Real ID friends (http://us.battle.net/en/realid/) from other realms and:<br>
<br>
Form a cross-realm raid and use Raid Finder<br>
Jump in to any classic dungeon or raid and be automatically placed in the same instance<br>
Join forces and dominate the Battlegrounds<br>
<br>
<br>
Please note, you will not yet be able to run normal or Heroic Dragon Soul with cross-realm Real ID raids.<br>
<br>
As we look forward to the BattleTag system (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/209494-introducing-battletag/), it&#x2019;s a very exciting time for World of Warcraft. No matter what realm you and your friends are on you&#x2019;ll be able to team up and take on group content throughout the game.<br>

Darkmoon Faire - Known Issues<br>
We&#x2019;ve identified a number of issues with the Darkmoon Faire this month, and they should be resolved for the February faire. Specifically, we found problems with:<br>
<br>
<br>
Attempting to turn in the Adventurer&apos;s Journal (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71953/adventurers-journal/) and Captured Insignia (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71952/captured-insignia/) which are associated with these quests &#x201C;The Captured Journal&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Enemy&apos;s Insignia&#x201D;. If you are having difficulty turning in these items, please contact our customer service department at http://us.battle.net/support/en/ and they will be able to provide you with 5 Darkmoon Prize Tickets per item.<br>
Unfortunately, &#x201C;The Darkmoon Faire&#x201D; quest cannot be made available for characters that previously completed the quest. This is due to the fact that this quest is not a new quest, but reuses the old quest ID. We realize this was an error and will be taking steps to not repeat it for future quests, but it does mean that characters that completed it before will not be able to complete the new version with the ticket reward.<br>
The reset of monthly achievement progress experienced by some is unfortunately unable to be reinstated. We apologize for this error and have taken steps to ensure it does not occur again.<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Anything on the drop changes that affect getting dungeon items from low level dungeons for 4/5 of the dungeon artifacts.<br>
This was a bug that is being hotfixed. A character that is not level-appropriate for a dungeon should not get Monstrous Egg (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71636/monstrous-egg/), Mysterious Grimoire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71637/mysterious-grimoire/), Imbued Crystal (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71635/imbued-crystal/), or Ornate Weapon (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71638/ornate-weapon/) drops. This is irrespective of whether or not the character has a Darkmoon Adventurer&apos;s Guide (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71634/darkmoon-adventurers-guide/) in her bags.<br>
<br>
2. Or a bug where the item would cease to exist or not spawn if someone without a guide was first to loot the bosses? Or people without a guide able to roll on it if someone with a guide does loot first?<br>
We previously had an issue where Grisly Trophy (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71096/grisly-trophy/) was only going to the player who recorded the killing blow. They are now distributed randomly. Furthermore, there were previously cases where all of the artifacts listed above could be rolled Need. That has been hotfixed and they are all now flagged Greed-only.<br>
<br>
3. As well as the ridiculously low drop rates of said items where even myself who tries to do at least 4 treatise runs a day sees 0 drops. I will end this fair without one despite putting forth literally hours into looking for one.<br>
Regarding drop rates, these items are dropping as-intended. They are rare, and the quests and achievements that depend on them are intended to take some time to complete. They&apos;re comparable to the Darkmoon decks and cards. We made them tradeable, so that players who experience a run of bad luck can still acquire what they&apos;re after by trading with friends or buying them on the auction house. <br>
<br>
January&apos;s Darkmoon Faire will come to a conclusion on Saturday, Jan. 7 at midnight. The faire will return again on Feb. 5, as planned. We apologize for the inconveniences some players have encountered with these issues. Thank you for your patience and feedback.</div></div>
