Stoy2019-06-05, 10:44 PMPatch 8.2 PTR - Frost Death Knight Changes
As people have noticed, a few changes on PTR, mainly intended to respond to concerns about the level 100 row:


Frost Strike  damage increased 15%
Breath of Sindragosa  damage reduced 10%
Icecap  reduces Pillar of Frost  cooldown by 3 seconds from 1 second


This is still a net buff to Breath in the patch, due to the addition of the 4 Runes. But the damage buff to Frost Strike primarily improves the other two talents. Icecap/Icy Citadel builds should also be a good bit more competitive.



Patch 8.2 PTR - Arms Warrior Changes
A few changes that don’t appear to have made it into this PTR pull are:


Mortal Strike , Execute , Slam , and Rend  damage increased 6%
Deep Wounds  damage increased 12%


Pretty straightforward–the Deep Wounds buff is largest to boost the value of Mastery somewhat.
