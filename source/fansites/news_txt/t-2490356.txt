Stoy2019-06-05, 10:44 PMPatch 8.2 PTR - Frost Death Knight Changes
As people have noticed, a few changes on PTR, mainly intended to respond to concerns about the level 100 row:


Frost Strike https://www.wowdb.com/spells/49143-frost-strike damage increased 15%
Breath of Sindragosa https://www.wowdb.com/spells/152279-breath-of-sindragosa damage reduced 10%
Icecap https://www.wowdb.com/spells/207126-icecap reduces Pillar of Frost https://www.wowdb.com/spells/51271-pillar-of-frost cooldown by 3 seconds from 1 second


This is still a net buff to Breath in the patch, due to the addition of the 4 Runes. But the damage buff to Frost Strike primarily improves the other two talents. Icecap/Icy Citadel builds should also be a good bit more competitive.



Patch 8.2 PTR - Arms Warrior Changes
A few changes that don’t appear to have made it into this PTR pull are:


Mortal Strike https://www.wowdb.com/spells/12294-mortal-strike, Execute https://www.wowdb.com/spells/163201-execute, Slam https://www.wowdb.com/spells/1464-slam, and Rend https://www.wowdb.com/spells/772-rend damage increased 6%
Deep Wounds https://www.wowdb.com/spells/262304-deep-wounds damage increased 12%


Pretty straightforward–the Deep Wounds buff is largest to boost the value of Mastery somewhat.
