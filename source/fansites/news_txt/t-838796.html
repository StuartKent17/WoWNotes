I assumed people would just check the tooltip but I&apos;d rather make sure it&apos;s veeery clear. <br>
Update - 2200 Rating Weapon Availability (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/153882/2200-rating-weapon-availability)<br>
<br>
Update - Archaeology Grey Items Prices<br>
The prices got changed again, Word of Empress Zoe is slightly less ridiculous and most of the prices have been increased again to compensate. (I didn&apos;t plan to post that so early, expect a better update in a few hours) <br>
<br>
Update - Please see This post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2162-Patch-4.0.6-Archaeology-Prices-Paragon-Al-akir-Kill-2200-Arena-Weapon-Blue-Posts)<br>
<br>
<br>
Patch 4.0.6 - PTR Build 13561<br>
A new PTR build will be deployed on test realms, most of these changes are probably already in the official notes but I&apos;m sure there are a couple of new things too. <br>
<br>
Important - For the first time in history, I decided to stop being stupid! Datamined info is now placed in MMO Champion quotes to help differentiate datamining from official information, and it only took me 4 years to do that! Feedback appreciated in comments.<br>
