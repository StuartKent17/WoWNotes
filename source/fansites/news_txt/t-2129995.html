Call of the Scarab Micro-Holiday<br>
The Call of the Scarab (http://ptr.wowdb.com/world-events/638-call-of-the-scarab) holiday event remembers the Gates of Ahn&apos;Qiraj (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Gates_of_Ahn%27Qiraj) world event from Vanilla. This event is an Alliance vs Horde showdown, with the victorious faction flying their faction banner for the next year. <br>
<br>
The Call of the Scarab (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/45785-call-of-the-scarab) quest will send you to Silithus so that you know where the vendor and world quests are. From there you can complete quests and defeat bosses to earn Commendations for your faction. Whichever faction has the most Commendations at the end of the event wins. <br>
<br>
Cultist Camps<br>
<br>
There are Twilight Cultist camps scattered around the zone.<br>
You will need to kill NPCs in the camp to acquire all three Cultist pieces: Twilight Cultist Cowl (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143858-twilight-cultist-cowl), Twilight Cultist Mantle (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143857-twilight-cultist-mantle), Twilight Cultist Robe (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143855-twilight-cultist-robe)<br>
Once you have applied all three pieces of the disguise, you can use a Lesser Wind stone to summon a NPC that you can solo. <br>
These drop Abyssal Crest (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143865-abyssal-crest) and remove one of your armor buffs when summoned. <br>
Abyssal Crest (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143865-abyssal-crest) are dropped by the Lesser Wind Stone bosses at the Cultist Camps.<br>

The Twilight Cultist Ring of Lordship (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143866-twilight-cultist-ring-of-lordship) can be used at a Greater Wind Stone to summon a stronger boss that will need a group.<br>

Kirin Tor Tavern Crawl Micro-Holiday<br>
The Kirin Tor Tavern Crawl (http://ptr.wowdb.com/world-events/646-kirin-tor-tavern-crawl) is a micro-holiday that sends players to different taverns around the world. <br>
<br>
<br>
You can join the currently active tavern from a new NPC in Dalaran (Tipsi Wobblerune (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119045-tipsi-wobblerune) or Anebria Sunwine (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119088-anebria-sunwine))<br>
After some time the group moves along to the next Tavern. You can press the last call button or take the portal to move on.<br>
If you get left behind on the tavern tour, you can catch up by speaking to the mage in the current tavern you are in. <br>
Each location has drink and food that you can interact with. The food will grant a well fed buff.<br>
There are also additional NPCs in each tavern enjoying the holiday.<br>
You can click on the discarded packages to apply one of many unique hat models for four hours. <br>

[Feedback] Marksmanship in 7.1.5<br>
This is further exacerbated in 7.1.5. Patient Sniper no longer provides an increased Focus pool, and Sidewinders generates only 35 Focus. With that in mind, and considering the passive Focus generation of 15 per GCD, Hunters are required to maintain 21.5% Haste in order to generate enough Focus to fire 3 Aimed Shots during Vulnerable. Firing a 3rd Aimed Shot during Vulnerable, especially with the new Patient Sniper design, is a huge DPS increase. 21.5% Haste will essentially be required for MM. This is a hard breakpoint, and should be eliminated before 7.1.5 goes live.<br>
<br>
There&apos;s a lot to discuss here--some we agree with and some we don&apos;t--but I want to swing by at least on this specific observation. We agree we don&apos;t want a major breakpoint between 2 and 3 Aimed Shots after a Marked Shot (at least, not at a middling amount like 21% haste that will affect gear choice throughout the expansion). We&apos;re not decided on a fix yet; in particular, whether the standard amount should be two Aimed Shots after a Marked Shot, or three (if two, it would still be okay to have three during Bloodlust and similar situations). The ability would be tuned around whichever option. Two has some advantages like concentrating the Vulnerable burst more, requiring standing still for less time to fully utilize it, and potentially having enough leeway for an instant before one of the Aimed Shots.

Boulderfist Talent<br>
Boulderfist is intended as a talent choice that creates some gaps in your rotation, by replacing your no-cooldown resource builder with something that&#x2019;s overall stronger, but has charges. In 7.1, the recharge time isn&#x2019;t long enough for those gaps to ever actually happen, especially with the most popular Enhancement talent build adding several more active abilities to your rotation. Its power level was also simply too high, and in this case, we&#x2019;d rather let this talent have its intended effect on the pace of your rotation and buff the spec as a whole to compensate. <br>
<br>
Our intent is that if you want to use an ability every GCD, you should choose one of the other options in that row. Boulderfist should result in an overall more methodical pace that is more about having a little time to plan upcoming abilities. When Boulderfist is the hands-down best option in that row, that doesn&#x2019;t feel like much of a choice, and as we continue tuning for 7.1.5, we hope to address this by bringing it in line with the others. <br>
<br>
While I can appreciate that there was an original design intent behind Boulderfist, the spec as it currently exists on Live is as enjoyable to play as it&apos;s ever been since I rolled my Shaman back in BC.<br>
<br>
We&apos;ve heard it reiterated over and over (and over) again by the developers that if something about a spec felt too mandatory, it would just get rolled into the spec. I play this spec as my main because it is fun; if I cared strictly about maximum overall damage output, I&apos;d focus on my Rogue instead. Changing a mechanic like this runs counter to the design philosophy that&apos;s been so oft repeated.<br>
Thanks for all the feedback; this has been a consistent theme throughout the thread and elsewhere. And we don&apos;t want to disrupt the familiar playstyle of 7.1 Enhancement, if in fact the specific pacing of Boulderfist&apos;s recharge time is a major part of what makes it work so well. We will still have to address the power level in some way without diluting the feel that&apos;s been discussed here. We are currently planning the following for PTR (uncertain on timing):<br>
<br>
--Boulderfist recharge time back to 6 seconds<br>
--Boulderfist no longer gives a bonus to critical strike<br>
--Rockbiter generates 20 Maelstrom (from 15) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/788075-enhancement-boulderfist-waiting-for-insight/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20752555084?page=5#89))<br>

Patch 7.1.5 Warlock Changes<br>
Thats all fine and dandy, now get to work fixing warlocks.<br>
Incidentally--Imp/Succubus/Voidwalker/Felhunter/Felguard all deal 20% more damage. Most of that was datamined normally, but in particular, the increase to Felguard&apos;s attack power likely was not (simply because it&apos;s something that happens server-side).<br>
<br>
I can think of one other thing worth calling attention to for feedback/testing that may have been missed: Mark of the Ancient Priestess and Mark of the Distant Army should do noticeably more healing/damage and be more worth using. Some of the stat-based neck enchants were also increased, but that will be clear in tooltips. Hidden Satyr scales correctly with gear now as well, and may be slightly weaker, but for the most part the other enchants were buffed to roughly its level.
