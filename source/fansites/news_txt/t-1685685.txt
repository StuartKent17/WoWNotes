Patch 6.1 - Heirloom Tab Updates
The latest build has made a few changes since we last looked at the heirlooms tab http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4644-Patch-6-1-Character-Models-Class-Tuning-Hotfixes-Heirlooms-Tab-Twitter-Toggle. Existing heirlooms http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4647-January-13-Hotfixes-Garrison-Campaign-Quests-Garrison-Music-Colorblind-Options are still added at the level 90 upgrade tier, as well as letting you keep the old copy in your bag.

The heirlooms now properly scale to level 90 when upgraded, rather than level 85. The new Dread Pirate Ring http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/122529-dread-pirate-ring is now upgradable.

Flying in Draenor
It's weird, I got the Garrison mission that rewards the Halaa tokens, so I went back to Outland to go buy the war Talbuk I never got. I take a taxi from the portal to Telaar, and then run to Halaa, and it wasn't until I saw someone else on a flying mount that it even hit me that I *could* fly. It was a really ... impactful, I guess, realization on how flying/not flying impacts my own personal gameplay. I guess the answer for me is not very much.

I know. Blah blah blah I'm a corporate drone, etc. etc. but honestly, as a player, I didn't even consider it was something that I had available to me. I think that says... something. I'm not sure what... Maybe just that I'm not personally that attached to flying as a game mechanic? I can understand how the exact opposite could be true for others, though.

Twitter Communication
The Real reason I hate Twitter. It causes people to use shorthand. I cannot STAND seeing people use shorthand like ppl for people, or no for know, or 2 for too/to. 
I think there's always a way to find room without abbreviations. The most I'll tend to do is use an ampersand & instead of "and". Things like that. But I know what you mean. It doesn't rile me up, but I have enough trouble living my own life to also try to live everyone else's for them too. 

The thing I don't particularly like about Twitter use is when someone tweets a whole forum post at me in 10-20 individual tweets. It's bad form for the format, and really goes against the primary benefit of the limited length format. Twitter, like any form of communication, has benefits and drawbacks. Talking on a phone cuts out the all-important body language. Talking in-person is ad hoc, and largely without the ability to put enough thought/editing into conveying an idea, and is influenced by sometimes uncontrollable physical distractions or cues. Which can also be a good thing!

Twitter is quick, it's short, and it's kind of like a one-on-one conversation in a large crowd of people. It works well at getting short and quick little bits of info back and forth between people, and others can listen in or interject or amplify it if they want, and also be able to curate the kinds of people they want around them. It's the cocktail party of communication formats. Whereas the forums are quite like a cork board where people can type up big long letters, and post them up, people can be typing up responses to other people's posted notes while other people type theirs, and there can be these really complex and chaotic conversations going lots of different ways, but with a lot of reading and filtering you can get a good sense for a sort of temperature range of the discussion and get lots of different ideas and thoughts out of lots and lots of text. It's a really interesting format for communication, but certainly has it's benefits and drawbacks as a form of communication and interaction, like... literally everything else! ...until complete peer to peer communication nears light speed with organic computing and a "human internet" which is, of course, just a step away from our consciousness merging into a being of pure light anyway. Of course. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/357682-the-real-reason-i-hate-twitter/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15699675476?page=5#94

Polished Battle-Stone
Polished stones don't have a specific type and i've tried them on every family and gray/whites to see if it mattered.
Hey all, hang on to those stones! We were able to investigate this issue and we have a fix coming in Patch 6.1. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/357649-polished-battle-stone-broken/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15142314108?page=1#13

TM vs SS Veto
Just dropping a note here for anyone that had Tarren Mill vs Southshore vetoed unchecked when the realms came down for maintenance this week, you may have noticed that you now only have 1 battleground deselected, because the now invisible TM vs SS battleground is still technically unchecked.

It's a bug we're aware of, in the meantime you can fix this yourself by entering the following in chat:

No, Razor Claws only affects Feral bleeds. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/552912745494880256

Why don't you Guys just deactivate/scale down the Ret Pala 4pc PvP Setbonus, instead of nerfing it?
it was over budget for PvP. Set bonus shouldn't be worth that much DPS. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/553048715955810308
Only issue is, i don't understand why it was brought down to 4 secs. Impossible to keep up 100% now. 2% makes sense
it shouldn't have 100% uptime. That's too much damage for set bonus. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/553276586904940544

PvE
can we please get a different way of getting augment runes, as a mythic raider it sucks feeling forced to do lfr
You feel doing Raid Finder is more efficient than just buying them from others who do? WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/552567317926658048

PvP
Why is XP awarded by BGs so low? Agree questing/dungeons should give more XP, but no need for BGs to be THAT low.
An oversight when implementing strong boxes. We are working on correcting but may take time. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/551553256577454081

Haven't won a bg in days, fighting on the road in Ashran..no go - How does it feel to be the most hated dev in history #hordelife
I'd have to see the dev hate index over time to believe you. We need a chart! make it happen! holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/551545247717937152
Why do you make so many snippy replies to "hate" messages instead of addressing real concerns?
I make snippy replies because I think humor is great for defusing tension. As for addressing "real" concerns... holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/551593415595417601
When people say "address real concerns" they are essentially saying, "tell me the changes that are coming to address X" holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/551593571065675778
and my twitter is not the appropriate place to make announcements or post change logs. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/551593788469047296
To discuss what we're thinking about is often confused for actual intent and just leads to confusion. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/551593924863606784
So, it is more appropriate for changes to be announced, once they're made, through our normal channels for clear messaging. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/551594149569257472

Could you quickly explain how criticism/suggestions from the WoW PvP community are handled @holinka
We read the feedback and weigh it against our own experience and internal data before making decisions. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/552690419192967168
But the community is not a hivemind. Many different people with a wide variety of opinions. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/552690576680710145

s15 was overall balanced. that's a fact. Nearly all specs were top tier.
Very hard to compare the first season of an expac with the last season of an expac. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/552892900413947904

Character / Items
Unsure if this is a bug, but killed The Lanticore in H UBRS and no one in group was able to loot/roll. Did the droprate on the pet change?
Droprates when loot is on Personal are different than when loot is on Group. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/549361090635644928

This expansion made inventory management worse. Toy box was one step forward and all the new stuff 5 steps back.
What new stuff are you having trouble fitting?
moroes' lucky polish. my inventory is fine save that one item.
Fixed in 6.1 I believe! A few things missed the bus. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/549473206709395456

Misc
Hows life on the rollercoaster? 8 sec kidney: "Holinka should be shot." 6 sec kidney: "Praise the second coming of based holinka."
Well, said it many times. It's a team. One person doesn't make all the decisions: good or bad. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/552626621560008704
