Blue posts
Player vs. Player
Casters vs. Melee
Now there are a lot of concerns about how casters are struggling against melee, but we don't think that is a "burst too good" issue. For the players complaining about Arms and Juggernaut, the issue is not that they get Mortal Striked for 10,000 or whatever. Plenty of casters can get off big nukes, but they aren't the problem du jour according to the forums. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367977436-we-dont-think-burst-is-a-problem.html

Burst damage in Arenas
Players complained about burst and DKs last season and had every right to. We think both are in a better place now.

There are definitely some situations where you can get into with a class and die too quickly. There are also situations where CC or healing or dispelling are too dominant. Arena balance isn't perfect and we'll continue to make changes as we go along. However, we don't feel like you can just summarize all of this season as being too bursty which we do think happened last season before people got enough resilience. If you look at a lot of the complaints coming out of Arenas right now, they are about healing Disc, Resto druids and various paladin specs at least and melee or at least Arms, Unholy, Ret and rogues vs. casters. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367977436-we-dont-think-burst-is-a-problem.html

[...] What is even more interesting is you appear to hold as fact or at least widespread consensus that PvP burst is too high, while writing off all the players who disagree with you as dumb too.

We think burst was too high in the previous season. That was because players were dying quickly before they could even respond or counter. If you go into an Arena match today and die, that does not mean burst is too high. Don't confuse dying and burst. Remember, you are probably going to lose about half your matches. That's the way the matchmaking system works. That doesn't mean the system is broken just because you don't win a lot.

There are situations in which one class can burst another down too quickly. There are also situations in which crowd control or healing are too dominant. We are trying to clamp those down when they get out of control. But "ZOMGBURST" is so last season. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367757877-revelation-about-ghostcrawler.html

Class balances and consequences on PvP representation
My point was that when you change a PvE ability, it usually only affects that class. When you change a PvP ability, it often affects multiple, perhaps all classes.

The intent I get from some posts is that some players assume that if their class is say 5% low in Arena representation that a simple buff might bring them up 5% and then everything is cool. But when they go up, nearly always other classes go up or down. You can buff a class indirectly by nerfing another one. Happens all the time.

Resilience
We're not convinced melee stop improving their resilience. Typically that only works for a class with such high CC or defensive potential that they just aren't taking damage much rogues typically have fallen into this category. Resilience doesn't lower damage -- it lowers burst damage. It means you have to whack at a guy a few times and can't just explode him on contact. It means you have to play smart -- blow cooldowns, use crowd control to minimize defenses, tie up the healer and otherwise cause damage at the right time instead of just causing damage. Remember as a caster, most melee have no inherent defense against you -- their armor does *nothing* versus magic damage. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367977436-we-dont-think-burst-is-a-problem.html

Itemization
Balancing around best in slot items
We don't balance just around best in slot because so few players will ever be at that point, and by the time they are, the content is usually on farm for them. You don't need best in slot to make progress in Ulduar and by the time you are halfway through Ulduar you probably have added a lot of Ulduar gear. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html

Classes
Hybrid classes
Our stance hasn't changed since Lich King. Originally pre-LK we tried to keep hybrid specs at 40% or more behind the pure damage-dealers, but then we also treated warriors as pure damage-dealers. If you really know your class, and I mean really know it, and if you have good gear, the right buffs, and a group that backs you up, then you are fully capable of topping the damage meters on certain fights. Overall we do want to make sure the pure dps classes are slightly higher when all things are equal, otherwise there is no point to those entire classes existing. Do warriors beat mages on some fights? Absolutely. What's the issue?

I'm not sure what you're getting at with that last part. Ret paladins were not a serious raiding option for many players pre-LK. Now they certainly are. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html

Death Knights in PvP and Frost Strike
The DK has to have a lot of runic power to use that ability, so they can't unload with it right off the bat the way say a Ret can. Unholy is still far more dominant in PvP, which makes us think this problem is a little overblown. We might remove the dodge and parry prevention from it, which we added to make sure DKs didn't just Deathcoil instead. There are enough talents for Frost Strike now that it's going to be attractive regardless. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367977436-we-dont-think-burst-is-a-problem.html

[...] Yes, the resource has a ton to do with it. Nobody complains about PoM Pyro much because it can be done so infrequently. Frost Strike and Scourge Strike are essentially finishing moves. It's harder to use them as openers.

Now that's not to say finishing moves can never be unbalanced, but I must admit to being a little surprised at all the focus on DKs. They were without a doubt too good last season, but currently they are below rogues in the brackets that "matter" and far below healers across the board. If I wanted to stack the deck to be succesful in Arena, I would be rolling a Disc priest, not a DK. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367977436-we-dont-think-burst-is-a-problem.html

Arrows drop in instances
Dropping one arrow would be fine. Dropping a stack of 1000 or even 10,000 would be pretty painful, which is what we'd have to do now.

We do need to be careful how many class-specific items we drop. Yes there are librams and idols and such, but high dps ranged weapons are already of pretty limited interest to other classes. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367977917-dropping-arrows-in-instances.html

MP5 on Paladin's gear
The issue that started all this was paladins saying "We don't want MP5 on our gear." The designers designed you assuming you'd have MP5 on your gear -- I know; I was there. If you are effective without having MP5 then it probably means you are going to be too powerful at some point because you are able to replace a less-powerful stat with a more powerful one without missing the loss of the less-powerful one.

Imagine you could prune every less-useful stat off your gear. Imagine you could trade in armor, Stamina and everything else for just spell power and crit. Do you think you'd blow away the other healers? I do. That's more extreme than giving up MP5 for more crit, but carries similar risks from a game-balance perspective.

Healers should care about Spirit druids and priests and MP5 paladins and shamans. It's fine to care about Int and crit too, but if you're ignoring Spirit and MP5 and aren't missing them, then something isn't working right.

Titan's Grip passive bonus
That is part of it, yes. All of the active abilities have some kind of cost, even if it's just a GCD. If you weren't spending rage on Mortal Strike or mana on Crusader Strike, you'd be spending it somewhere else. A passive talent that improves dps in almost all situations and requires almost no action or decision on the part of the player is incredibly risky. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html

Titan's Grip as a multi-point talent?
The problem with TG as a five-point talent is that it doesn't divide evenly by five. You can't say "Makes you 20% able to wield two two-handers" at rank one. That means inevitably one rank of the talent is worth a lot more than the others and we've had trouble any time talents are structured that way. 

[...] If you were around through beta, we tried that. Not many players liked it. May took a single point in TG and then spent other points elsewhere. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html

Titan's Grip nerf
TG isn't nerfed into the ground though. Players occasionally try to show how it's a dps loss, but they have failed every attempt I have seen. If the talent improves your dps by 25% and then the 10% penalty lowers than benefit by 15% including rage loss then it's still giving you a 10% dps boost, which is about ten times higher than we shoot for with one talent point. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html

[...] The TG nerf took lost rage into account. This was a myth started by warriors who didn't like the change. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html

Warrior damage in PVE
Naxx warrior damage was too high. If it is slightly low now which we think it is, that doesn't make the former untrue. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html
