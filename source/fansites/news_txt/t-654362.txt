Today, Exodus http://www.exo-guild.com/ US-Ysondre finally took down the last undefeated hard mode of Ulduar : Alone in the Darkness 25 player http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3164/alone-in-the-darkness-25-player/! Congratulations to them. 

As we suspected, the extra loot you get for beating Yogg-Saron in the hardest mode is nothing less than Mimiron's Head http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/45693/.
