Streaming Launcher Improvements<br>
We recently released a new Cataclysm beta launcher that allows you to stream game data while you play. We&apos;ve received a lot of feedback from you regarding this new feature, and that feedback has allowed us to improve the player experience significantly.<br>
<br>
In the next beta patch, you&apos;ll receive a new Cataclysm beta launcher that includes several updates to in-game streaming. Here&apos;s a quick preview of some of the upcoming changes:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Improved three-stage progress bar<br>
Download speed improvements<br>
Detailed peer-to-peer connection information<br>
Bandwidth detection, which will improve the play experience of those with low bandwidth<br>
New UI with a Cataclysm-inspired theme<br>
Many bug fixes<br>
<br>
<br>
We encourage you to continue posting your feedback about the streaming launcher, as we&apos;re constantly looking for ways to get you into the game faster and more smoothly.<br>
<br>
Thank you! <br>

Attacks Scaling<br>
Most of these attack still scale from weapon damage. We just changed them from say 200% weapon damage to 100% weapon damage with a higher attack power component. We want weapon damage to matter, but not quite as much as it does on live.<br>
<br>
As an example, Chimera Shot now says: &quot;An instant shot that causes weapon damage plus N, refreshing your Serpent Sting and triggering an effect depending on the venom on the target...&quot;. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560841361/hunter-s-build-12857-removiing-weapon-dmg/))<br>

Seal of Insight<br>
Seal of Insight will improve your mana regen and self healing. It will give you a little of each if you only Judge and give you more (but not a broken amount) if you&apos;re ever in a position where you can melee the target. There is also a glyph to improve your healing while Insight is active. I&apos;ll concede that running a Seal is probably more important for a Ret or perhaps even Prot paladin than a Holy paladin, but there&apos;s still no reason not to do so. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560568391/lack-of-seal-for-holy-pally/))<br>
<br>
Seal of Justice / Righteousness<br>
Seal of Righteousness and Seal of Justice didn&apos;t merge. Seal of Righteousness is unchanged. We just added a little damage to Seal of Justice so that paladins didn&apos;t have to give up all Seal damage (and talents etc. that affect them) in order to get the Justice effect. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560570779/ret-build-12857/))<br>
<br>
Selfless Healer change<br>
We buffed it to 50/100% more healing when used on others (up from 30/60%). These numbers are unlikely to be final. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560570779/ret-build-12857/))<br>

Thunderstorm removed from Elemental Reach<br>
It buffed Thunderstorm from 10 to 12 yards, which is pretty hard to even notice. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560511186/shaman-12857-changes/))<br>

New Life Tap<br>
Life Tap scaling with spellpower was proving hard to balance. We buffed Drain Life as well, so you should be able to Life Tap once and then Drain Life your way back up. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560570770/ouch-lifetap-change/))</div></div>
