02:40 CET - Added Glyphs changes in class changes. 
02:25 CET - Added a very important about honor reset in WotLK at the top of the page. 
02:15 CET - Skills and Talents list are now up to date. 
02:00 CET - Added Death Knight changes, also a new spell for hunters it seems. 


No Honor reset at the release of WotLK
We had hoped that the introduction of some new Honor rewards in the upcoming patch would give players a great opportunity to spend any of their remaining Honor. However, many players would still be surprised by an Honor and token reset as it isn’t something we’ve done in the past. As such, we've decided to not reset Honor or tokens upon the release of Wrath of the Lich King. Players who save their Honor will be able to spend it on level 80 rewards, although those rewards will be significantly more expensive than their level 70 counterparts.
