<br>
In addition to completing Battle for Azeorth, Pathfinder Part 1 (https://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/12989-battle-for-azeroth-pathfinder-part-one), which can currently be completed on live servers, players will need to reach revered reputation status with two new factions: The Unshackeled (H) / The Akoan (A) and the Rustbolt Resistance. <br>
<br>
Players that unlock flying will also receive the Wonderwing 2.0 mount!<br>

Patch 8.2 PTR - Anglers&apos; Water Striders<br>
For those of you who own a water strider mount, you will receive a Anglers&apos; Water Striders (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168416-anglers-water-striders) from Nat Pagle in the mail upon logging in after Patch 8.2 goes live. <br>
<br>
<br>
This new mount equipment can be slotted into your mount equipment slot to let all your mounts walk on water. <br>
Your water strider will no longer be able to walk on water without this slotted.<br>
This item is consumed when you replace it with a new piece of equipment in the mount equipment slot and needs to be purchased and slotted again to gain the effect.<br>
If you own a water strider, you can head to The Anglers in Krasarang Wilds and purchase a new one from Nat Pagle for 40 gold.<br>
Currently, there is no option to purchase this from Nat Pagle in your garrison.<br>
