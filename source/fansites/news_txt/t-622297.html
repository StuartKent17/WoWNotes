Hello everybody, I have to correct my previous statement: We can not make sure Wrath of the Lich King will be available as a download on the release day. Please excuse the caused confusion.<br>
<br>
Greetings, Lyonthori<br>

Wrath of the Lich King available for download on release day ?<br>
This is probably the most confusing news post ever if we consider that yesterday, I reported that Wrath of the Lich King wouldn&apos;t be downloadable on Day 1. However according to an official post on the german forums, Blizzard will make the game available for download on release day! I wouldn&apos;t take it as 100% sure before we see an US post about it but it&apos;s not the first time we see something announced in europe first. <br>

Arena End Reminder<br>
The next Arena season will begin on December 16th !<br>
We wanted to remind everyone that Arena season 4 is coming to a close. During next Tuesday&apos;s maintenance, all arena teams, as well as ratings, will be wiped and arena charter NPCs disabled. Thus, arena points will, unfortunately, not be rewarded for rated games played this week.<br>
<br>
The next Arena season will begin on December 16th, and once that happens players at level 70 will be able to participate in rated matches against level 70 opponents and gain Arena points for item purchases but will not count towards the end of season rewards. At the same time, level 80 players will be able to compete in rated arena matches where they can gain arena points which can be used to purchase level 80 arena gear, as well as compete for end-of-season rewards. Additionally, players at level 70 will continue to be able to play skirmish Arena matches against other level 70 opponents even after Wrath of the Lich King launches. It&apos;s also important to note that two new skirmish brackets (71-75, 76-80) will be available for players who wish to hone their Arena skills while leveling in Northrend. <br>
<br>
<br>
Two New Arenas<br>
With the latest patch release, we&#x2019;ve added two new arenas: the Dalaran Sewers and the Ring of Valor in Orgrimmar. These arenas offer new obstacles and challenges for strategy savvy players. The arenas have been added to the random rotation and are accessible via the queue system as Skirmishes. For more information on these two new arenas, please visit http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/insider/11/arena.xml (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/insider/11/arena.xml). Both Dalaran Sewers and the Ring of Valor will also be available for tournament play during Arena Season 5. <br>
<br>
<br>
Pet Defensive Change<br>
We recently changed the way defensive stance works for pets. In the old design, the pet would not attack a target that you were attacking until it did something to generate threat - typically attacking you. In the new design, as soon as you attack a target, the pet will attack the target too. Our thinking was that this made defensive a little easier to use and you still have passive to override that behavior.<br>
<br>
However, we have heard from some players (hunters mostly, though this isn&apos;t just a hunter issue) that they prefer the old defensive stance. We wanted to get a little more feedback from players on the issue.<br>
<br>
In order to keep this readable, please don&apos;t stray into other hunter or pet issues that don&apos;t directly affect this topic. Also please don&apos;t attempt to redesign the feature (such as having four stances).<br>

Europe - Realm Compensation<br>

<br>
Professions - New recipes<br>
It is very likely that we will be adding more recipes to all trade skills as the content progresses. The reason the crafter only weapons were done away with however was that most people chose to take the profession purely for the purposes of being able to skip ahead of the content or not do the content because smithing provided them with something far easier to attain than anything else they could normally get. While this is ok from time to time with an occasional piece of gear, the concept of crafters making &quot;best in slot&quot; items was more or less considered bad from our end. When many people dropped the trade skills they enjoyed simply because taking a different trade skills made them more powerful (Stormherald, Frozen Shadowweave) than that is clearly not what we intended.<br>
<br>
As far as &quot;what do I get from profession X&quot;, well I think many of the posters in this thread have pointed that out. All trade skills now provide some special benefit to the crafter that isn&apos;t just a super item. In the case of blacksmithing it&apos;s the ability to add sockets to your gear. Most of the profession perks are relatively equal in terms of what they provide, some are slightly better than others, but not enough so that you should feel ou are missing out by doing the profession you enjoy doing.

Circle of Healing / Wild Growth / Chain Heal<br>
Based on feedback from this forum, elsewhere and our own brainstorming, what we are thinking about right now is something like a 6 sec cooldown for Circle of Healing and Wild Growth.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re less concerned about Chain Heal, in part because it&apos;s not instant, prevents movement, falls off with multiple targets, and is the spell that shamans are supposed to be hitting, while priests and druids have many other spells.<br>
<br>
At 6 seconds, you would still want to use CoH/WG in the right situations (though hopefully not *every* time they are up), but you&apos;d also want to use other spells during the cooldown. To be fair, a lot of priests and druids are asking to push other buttons.<br>
<br>
This sounds like a potentially scary change because it has a lot of ramifications -- one of the reasons we are mentioning it so early is to get feedback. We don&apos;t want Resto shammies to push other healers out of raids. We would change some of the encounters knowing that CoH spam was no longer possible. <br>
<br>
Didn&apos;t you try this before ?<br>
Yeah, we did. We thought it would feel like a big nerf and changed our minds. But seeing the state of healing at 80 makes us think it might be the right call again. When AE healing is so prominent, it also makes specs without great AE heals (Holy paladins and Disc priests) feel uselss.<br>
<br>
Assume that we would lower Wild Growth by the same proportion as Circle of Healing. The exact numbers aren&apos;t as important to this discussion as the concept that you can&apos;t hit the button whenever you want.

Starfall<br>
So this took some digging but apparently there was a change to stealth in between 3.0.2 and 3.0.3 so that the stars would no longer target a stealthed opponent. The AE splash from a star hitting another target will contine to take a stealther out of stealth. Maaven&apos;s answer was technically correct. It isn&apos;t a bug in that we changed the stealth code.The change to Starfall wasn&apos;t intended so we&apos;re trying to decide if we want to change it back or leave it in its current form. I&apos;m not sure the world will end either way, but I wanted to provide an update since it was a bit of a head scratcher.

Autoshot not casting during Volley<br>
That is by design. Even if it wasn&apos;t by design, the current implementation is a good idea because Volley does so much damage now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12354807735-hunter-bug-x2-since-303.html))<br>
<br>
Cat pet DPS nerfed and exotic pets balance<br>
We made a big pass on pet dps for 3.0.3 so I&apos;m not sure if your tests are reflecting those changes or not. Cats are still a good dps pet, but they shouldn&apos;t flat out beat every exotic. The exotic balance is obviously tricky. BM of all hunters shouldn&apos;t be forced to only be able to pick from the relatively small pool of exotic pets.

Disengage wasting the cooldown/mana when rooted<br>
Is this in 3.0.3 (the most recent patch)? We actually made a change to prevent it from using the mana. You just get a &quot;Can&apos;t do that&quot; error if rooted. Can anyone confirm? (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12454625733-ghostcrawlerconcerning-disengage.html))<br>

Developer Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12368278063-mage-status-update-please.html))<br>
1) You fixed Deep Wounds, where is our Ignite fix?<br>
Unfortunately, they are apples and oranges with regard to fixes. Ignite sometimes munching charges has a lot to do with Internet lag. We just can&apos;t always tell when one hit lands a split second before another one. We are still working on it though because it&apos;s a cool talent. I know I have personally answered this question many times, so I&apos;m surprised you couldn&apos;t find that answer. <br>
<br>
2) You are spending resources to make Disengage work, where is our Blink fix? <br>
If we can fix the problem with slopes and minor obstructions that will apply to both talents. Disengage has some additional bugs that Blink doesn&apos;t have. <br>
<br>
3) What&apos;s going on with Spirit? It&apos;s still a throw away stat. <br>
Strength is a throw away stat. Spirit benefits you, just not as much as you&apos;d like. We&apos;re talking a lot about all of the &quot;converts one stat into another talents.&quot; Many of those were implemented to solve problems with different specs sharing gear. We&apos;re not sure we want to go down the road of providing talents to convert every second tier stat into a primary stat. That list would get long. <br>
<br>
4) What&apos;s going on with Arcane? Are we going to get a new rotation because we&apos;re perceived to be OP in PvP? <br>
We would like to give you a new rotation mostly because Arcane Blast doesn&apos;t really work in PvE and because the PvP &quot;rotation&quot; seems to be: something -&gt; something -&gt; bored -&gt; ARCANE BARRAGE!<br>
<br>
On the OP issue, here is one of those times where people are calling for nerfs but we don&apos;t believe it&apos;s a problem. To everyone who thinks we knee jerk based on QQ posts, here is a case where that&apos;s not happening. <br>
<br>
5) What&apos;s going on with Frost? Are we going to see some shatter combos?<br>
You have some. If you mean in PvE, we would like to provide some. The two things standing in our way at the moment are: 1) Frost PvE dps is already high, so we would have to nerf it in order to build it back up through combos (which seems to be fine with a lot of Frost mages, but isn&apos;t the highest priority ATM because the issue is &quot;not interesting enough&quot; instead of &quot;broken&quot;), and 2) Frost Bolt just does more damage than Ice Lance. If we buff Ice Lance, then PvP shatters are too high. So we need to rebuild the spells and talents to make the whole thing work -- it&apos;s not an easy fix. But it&apos;s something we want to do.<br>
<br>
I know we have neglected the beta forums. Beta is ending soon and I thought it was more important to try and invest a little energy in getting these role forums off to a good start. <br>
<br>
2) &quot;NOOBS PLAY RETADINS AND HUNTARDS...&quot; (of course, I&apos;m paraphrasing)... &quot;AND THERE ARE MORE NOOBS THAN MAGES.&quot;<br>
The real reason has to do with the fact that we changed paladin and hunter mechanics quite a bit, so they are understandably going to require more iteration. But I try as a rule not to pay attention to &quot;who has gotten the most attention&quot; issues. That&apos;s just a losing battle for me. <br>

Sheath of Light<br>
Sheathe was designed to let Ret make use of the fact that, yanno, the spec actually is part of a healing class. But we can totally understand why a talent designed for someone with low healing stats that isn&apos;t healing a lot would be attractive to someone with high healing stats that did heal a lot.

Sanctified Wrath is not giving us the &quot;bypasses 50% of damage reducing effects&quot; effect when we pop AW. It hasn&apos;t been since the 3.0.3 patch.<br>

Elemental Shaman balance at lvl 70<br>
Fun is very relative. I think shamans are fun now. Obviously other players may disagree. I think the part where shamans aren&apos;t as fun is actually at low level when you don&apos;t have a lot of spells and are forced to either slowly drop your totems every fight or just live without them. <br>
<br>
I think the shaman is definitely playable now. The class doesn&apos;t crash your client when you play one and if your damage is low at all, it certainly isn&apos;t at 50% of other specs.<br>
<br>
Being a good raid member now (and at 60) is important to us, but far, far less important than at 80. The number of raids being done at levels less than max is a trivial number and we would be doing a disservice to most of our customers if we spent too much effort to solve such edge cases. I also think there would be howls of protest if we announced we were slipping LK in order to address balance concerns at 60 and 70. Everyone knows Lich King is going to ship next week. We tried to give you plenty of fun things to do (achievements, raiding EZ mode, zombies) since some of the class changes to prepare for LK started going in several weeks ago.
