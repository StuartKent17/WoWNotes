Blue Tweets
I know blizz are stubborn but you must realise faction arena titles was a huge mistake. Has there been any positive feedback? 
Quite the contrary, it is having the desired effect. For example, in NA the cutoff difference between each faction is very close.
holinka 
What Im noticing is top players just camp an alt of their main class "2nd druid" on the easier faction. Even a 50 point difference is big.
Probably a few but not the majority. Likewise we were told "everyone switches and switches back" but in reality, it wasn't the case for most holinka 
On Eu it feels kind of weird since for example last season people on horde got r1 with 100 Rating lower than alliance.
We expect that gap to continue to shrink over time. holinka 

what is blizzard trying to achieve then if its having its desired effect? A 3000 rated alliance player missing r1 and a 2900 horde gets it?
Our intent is to distribute our best PvP players as evenly as possible between both factions as that benefits the game as a whole. holinka 
With each season since the change to faction based titles, we have seen that distribution improve. holinka 
No it doesn't, the most beneficial is when all of the best PvP players play 1 faction so they can all play with eachother.
We fundamentally disagree on that point. holinka 

is there anyway to track 150 wins after faction changing 2 times? i xfered horde played there then went back. WarcraftDevs
There isn't really and admit that it's a problem we need to correct for the future. holinka 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
What is the best approach to rebalancing a particular ability/champion/class/etc. - to do one large, comprehensive balance pass over one update, or several smaller, incremental balance passes over many updates?
All things being equal, I would advocate that it’s better to do it once. Touching something in many updates just increases the chance of introducing bugs, makes it feel like balance is unresolved and therefore perhaps not worth players’ time to invest in mastering it, and can also get really wearying for players who play that character.

However, overdoing a change has all of these risks and even more. Overshooting a target and then having to revert changes adds to the sense that game balance isn’t anywhere approaching stable and can feel ever crappier to players who love that character than slowly creeping towards a target.

It’s one of those Price is Right deals - get as close as you can without going over.

Now sometimes we’ll run into a situation where small +3% changes don’t have a meaningful impact. In those cases, it’s entirely possible that we don’t even have a sense for the order of magnitude. We’re tuning the dial by 3% when really it’s going to take a 50% buff or nerf to solve the problem. That clearly could take a really long time. 

If this seems to be happening, I would advocate for making a massive change - double the number or whatever. You will likely overshoot your target, perhaps by a lot, but at least you’ll know where the endpoints of your continuum are so you can try to get things somewhere in the middle. This tactic works much better for internal testing where you can explain your goals finding the extremes than foisting it on players who have to suffer even more balance problems just so you can get your shit together.
