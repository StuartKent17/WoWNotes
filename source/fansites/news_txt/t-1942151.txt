Legion - Rogue Class Hall
The Rogue class hall was updated in the latest build.


You no longer enter through the sewers, but instead show your insignia to an NPC in the Wine and Cheese shop or the General Goods shop on the opposite side of Dalaran. 
After showing these NPCs your insignia, you can open a secret bookcase door or use a knocker to enter the Rogue Class Hall.
The Class Hall itself was updated, with new NPCs and different decorations in the latest build.
You can exit through either of the entrances, or off of a plank down the sewer drain pipe down into the Broken Isles.

Patch 6.2.3 Hotfixes - January 28
Class
Paladin

Talents

Sacred Shield's critical effect should now be correctly reduced by Battle Fatigue.



Raid Testing Schedule - January 29
On Friday, January 29, we will continue our Legion Alpha raid testing of Heroic encounters.

Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Our general plan is to test every encounter on Heroic difficulty first, and then test sections of the raid on Normal and Raid Finder, alongside targeted Mythic tests.

Friday, January 29


Nythendra - Heroic Emerald Nightmare - 14:00 PST 17:00 EST, 23:00 CET
Skyopyron - Heroic Suramar Palace - 15:00 PST 18:00 EST, 00:00 CET


As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of an alpha environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.

Q: How do I get into the raid zone?

A: In Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade Sr. in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.

Q: What character should I use to test the raid?

A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players' effective level to 110 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounters being tested.

Q: How long does testing last?

A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we're satisfied that we've received that information for a given boss, we'll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.


FEEDBACK: Neltharion's Lair Normal
Please use this thread to post any feedback on the Neltharion's Lair dungeon. When posting, please note your group composition and any relevant information about the nature of your group e.g. random LFG group, Mythic raider guildmates, etc.. At this stage, a lot of overall combat balance is in flux, but we're still very interested in hearing overall feedback and impressions of the experience and mechanics.

Note that Eye of Azshara was opened a bit prematurely and we'll be closing it shortly - we'll post a separate feedback thread for that dungeon when we're ready for feedback.

Remember that you are playing a level-up Normal dungeon. That doesn't mean that things can't still be undertuned even with that target in mind, but something like Iron Docks Normal or Slag Mines Normal is a fair point of comparison for desired tuning and many folks haven't run those dungeons on that difficulty in quite some time. If it feels noticeably easier than those, then that is of course important for us to hear.

Thoughts on Tanking/Blood in Legion
Nothing meaningful changed for Blood in this last build.
Stay tuned for the next build, which has some significant changes for Blood. GCD utilization in the build currently on alpha is way too low, and we'll be significantly increasing it aka, making the rotation 'faster'.

[Feedback] Arms Warrior
Where did Headlong Rush go?
What use is Haste when the auto-swing increase is negligible?

Just a bug. Headlong Rush is intended to stay. It's missing due to a bug; we'll get that fixed soon.

EDIT: A clarification... Arms does have Headlong Rush, it's just not affecting Mortal Strike's cooldown properly. It is affecting most of your GCDs properly, though.

Double taxing at minimum players who already bought Dual Spec? No. Just. No.Pic via MMOC https://t.co/typ5AwtPx7
And interesting poll, but why only gold options? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/690392510036860929

Lore
I don't believe it's poor word choice. If demons are technically alive then Infernals can't be demons if they are constructs which you stated were never really alive. This calls into question what homunculi are. It's stated that they can be constructed even though they're demons.
demons are all different species and come from different planets, so I think it's a more encompassing term Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/690425865474301952
