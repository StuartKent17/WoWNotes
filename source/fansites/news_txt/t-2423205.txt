A few locations are easier with a Goblin Glider, and one requires some sort of slow fall.



The Scroll

Head to Heart of Darkness in Nazmir. Start at the bridge at 46,54 that is in the Blood Troll area to get to the middle structure. 
Once at the top of the Heart of Darkness, you need to carefully jump down the outside edge to click on the note at 51, 59.
If you are having trouble getting to the note , a Goblin Glider  may be helpful.



 


Pebble One

Head to The Broken Shore, at 37.45, 71.63 and click on the light grey pebble on the table near Dark'thul.
You may need to talk to Dark'thul to turn him away from the table if he isn't sleeping nearby.



  


Pebble Two

Head to Boralus at 49, 40, walk through the net on the side of the dock and down into the cave. The pebble is in the center of the floor towards the back.


 


Pebble Three

Head to Atal'dazar, Zuldazar
From the flight path, take the road up towards the dungeon portal. Take a right to the road that goes up the mountain right before the portal.
Follow this road north until you see a large flat stone surface and the waterfall. Go through the small arch on the right towards the waterfall.
Continue along the path behind the waterfall, then across the rocks on the waterfall, down to a corner of the temple structure and grass. Repeatedly jump up that way, go forward and then up the side of the mountain.
Use a glider or some slow fall to head down into the valley and the cave at the bottom.
The pebble is located at the to the left of the large stone column right after entering, behind the tree branch.

Pebble Four

Head to Drustvar, up the path towards Arom's Strand, then jump down to the second tier of the waterfall, head into the cave, and click the right eye of the effigy in the back. The cave mouth is at 35, 55.



  


Pebble Five
Head to 63, 21 in Vol'dun Tortaka Refuge and drop down into the hidden cave. Be sure to avoid the NPC in the cave, as he will one shot you. The pebble is behind some rocks near the wall far away from the NPC, near the entrance.


 


Pebble Six
Head to 66.93, 14.84 in Stormsong Valley and enter the cave hidden in the bushes. The pebble is inside the cave at 68, 13.


 


Pebble Seven
Grab Swim Speed Potions  / Feast of the Fishes  and Elixirs of Water Walking  or a Water Strider mount, and head to Nazmir. Go out to the edge of fatigue and head towards 54, 7 in the Zandalar map. You'll need to get there quickly, then use a swim speed buff to click the pebble before dying. 


 


Pebble Eight
Head back to 37,80 in Boralus to enter the maze. Go straight back and around the corner to the basement. Kill the five NPCs downstairs and get the pebble by the boxes and keg. 


 


Pebble Nine
Go to 18, 7 in Drustvar to take the path to a cave. The pebble is on the top of the large rock outside.


 


Pebble Ten

Head to 75, 70 in Tirigarde Sound with some invisibility potions. Enter the cave, use the potion, and get the pebble. The screenshot below is facing into the cave, so walk in and look behind some rocks halfway back to the left.


 


Pebble Eleven

Head to 80, 19 in Tirigarde Sound and look for the waterfall. You'll need to head up and then jump down on to some rocks to access the cave behind the waterfall.


 


Pebble Twelve

Head to 10, 82 in Tirigarde Sound, enter the hidden cave, head to the rocks on the right, and move your camera around until you can see the pebble.


 


Pebble Thirteen

Head to 63, 21 in Vol'dun Tortaka Refuge with water walking potions or a Water Strider then set a waypoint for Zandalar 45.78 -3.34. 
Once there, head to Zandalar 55.72 -10.21 and into the underwater cave. There will be blips of fatigue along the way. 
The pebble is close to the cave entrance near some rocks on the right when facing the entrance from the inside. 



 


Baaâ€™l and Uuna

Head to 62, 22 in Frostfire Ridge and defeat Baa'l after weakening him.
You either need to have Uuna  or someone with an upgraded Uuna needs to have the summon active nearby to weaken Baa'l. 
Baa'l can get into a bugged state where Unna won't be able to weaken him. Gastropod Shell  will reset him and fix this.
This rewards Baa'ls Darksign 
It isn't clear if this is the end of the secret or not.
