Addons - Garrison Mission Management
Master Plan http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/master-plan doesn't work yet, but the author has indicated http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/master-plan/tickets/550-addon-no-longer-works-in-6-2/ that he knows it is an issue! 

In the mean time, there are two other mission management addons that should help. Garrison Commander http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/garrisoncommander is the more complex one. It has many of the features Master Plan had, but not all of them. It does have some extra features though! Garrison Mission Manager http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/garrison-mission-manager is a simple addon that will allow you to optimize followers for individual missions. It appears to be compatible with both Master Plan and Garrison Commander.

Hellfire Citadel Progress
The first night of raiding is well underway and Wild Card http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/frostmourne/Wild+Card is already 8/13 Heroic. If you can't wait for the full clear, the final cinematic was posted earlier today on a Chinese video site. There is no English audio, so for the best experience just wait another day or two for the full thing!

Blue Tweets
Classes
What was the thinking behind the decision to abandon class trainers? It cost time and money, sure, but it got people moving around
It felt immersive, but at the cost of flying back to SW at every ding, messing with quest flow. Not sure what's best. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/610307067425861632

PvE
Any reason to not have flying combat? Limit movement speed, have specific sets of abilities tailored to mounts?Nothing ----
Nothing specific, though 3D combat is a challenge, hard to tell where enemies are coming from, see: Ogri'la/Vashj'ir Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/610159486406295553

Lore
Anywho, can we get a confirmation if WoW's imps are like Diablo's homunculi as in they are created from flesh but are neither
Imps are demons. Homunculi in Kara are demons with cool names. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/610323715478261760

Pets and Pet Battles
yes, Kura/Eris account, Draenor Tamers account... 15 tiny terrors, 15 bags per char on PTR right now?
Intended for now, potentially will be reduced to account-based in a future patch. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/609872809729224704
