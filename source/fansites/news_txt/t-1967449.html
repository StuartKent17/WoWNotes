Legion PvP Testing<br>
This morning, a wave of invites was sent out with a focus on PvP experience. We&apos;ll continue to monitor participation. Thanks! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/405780-accurate-testing/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743015132?page=1#3))<br>

Item Level Scaling in PvP<br>
Can we get any confirmation how it trickles down to lower level PvP? Still static 0.1%?<br>
Low levels are currently set to the same scaling values as level 110. The baseline item level is different for each bracket. It is approximately the ilevel of an heirloom item at the max level for each bracket. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/405378-anyone-know-how-ilv-is-scaled-in-pvp/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743024723?page=1#10))<br>

Grove Warden<br>
Will they ever fix Grove warden? The camera bug is making me so dizzy, I love the looks of the mount but can&apos;t stand using it.<br>
Just a... heads-up... this is something that we are aware of and it&apos;s being tracked for a fix in an upcoming patch. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/405630-groove-warden/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17610891710?page=1#9))<br>

Classes<br>
doesn&apos;t matter when often one &quot;style&quot; is too good not to play over the other talent. i often choose my gameplay style by class.<br>
During alpha, you should pretty much ignore tuning. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/709792052326703104))<br>

happy with the state of balance druid gameplay on #legion? Would love to hear design goal, spec seems a bit... lost atm<br>
Balance is looking solid, especially after the latest Artifact revisions. Any specific feedback or questions? https://t.co/hyt0g0EJ7q (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/709558212911964160))<br>
Our issues are here in this post, but no Dev gave us an answer.https://t.co/DvhMjCUogp<br>
That feedback is almost exclusively about tuning, which hasn&apos;t happened yet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/709567924017754112))<br>

Will male-BE in #legion eventually get ALL the updated melee animations? (i.e. Bloodthirst upwards swing instead of old spin)<br>
This is an interesting question. They have the animations, but some iconic race-specific animations are still... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/709464102666522624))<br>
...used for a few things, since players found them iconic. Don&apos;t want to lose all the soul of the race. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/709464670193717248))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
Will the Warglaives of Azzinoth be recoded as &quot;warglaives&quot; with new warglaive animations? Or still swords and old animation?<br>
It&apos;s important that Warriors and Rogues continue to be able to use them, so they will likely remain as swords. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/709558649702625280))<br>
<br>
The shapeshift camera bug is there with ghost wolf form, too<br>
We are aware of this issue across many transformations on the Alpha. We&apos;re working on fixing it soon. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/709558961939177473))<br>
<br>
Artifact based abilities seem to act like Artifact is a separate mob - critless DotS, only 5% Crit, no benefits from Mastery<br>
They should act like you casting them, using your stats. It&apos;s a bug if not. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/709816076243107840))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
Curious if WarcraftDevs are seeing anyone use Adaptation or Relentless in #PVP. Everyone I&apos;ve seen uses Medallion. <br>
We would be interested in hearing feedback from players who have tried Adaptation or Relentless in PvP. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/709552349438545920))<br>
<br>
Will we get an option to see our PvP Prestige progress on a bar like our Xp and Artifact Power?<br>
Yes, this will be an option! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/709552558860140544))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
LFD was a choice between doing content or not doing it at all. Could take hours to find dungeon groups.<br>
I&apos;ll argue that&apos;s a false dichotomy. I agree with the problem but maybe there were other solutions. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/709431161114591233))<br>
<br>
I dont get why you think matchmaking is no valid group setup mechanism if most of the players prefer it over organization.<br>
I think they are valuing convenience though. It&apos;s like being surprised that players like free loot. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/709466072739479552))<br>
In BC, Mechanar was the most popular dungeon by far. I don&apos;t think it was for the encounters. It was for quick badges. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/709466531550244865))<br>
So you just have to be careful when you measure participation that you don&apos;t mis-conclude they love the content they are doing. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/709466737628975110))<br>
