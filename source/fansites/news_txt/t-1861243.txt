Battle.net Mobile Authenticator Updated
The Battle.net Mobile Authenticator app has recently been updated for both iOS and Android, and it’s been rebuilt from the ground up to make it faster, more efficient, and easier to use. You’ll also notice some extra shine and polish, including a brand-new design that displays a new piece of art from one of Blizzard’s games every time you load a code.

Android
Players using the iOS version will also now be able to use iCloud to make it easier than ever to back up and restore your Authenticator, streamlining the setup process whenever you need to recover or switch to a new device.

can anyone confirme that rares are only lootable once a day, even on TIMELESS ISLE? thanks^^
This is only the case from WoD onward and does not affect timeless isle outside of a few chests Muffinus 

Just wondering, what are your thoughts about maybe an infinite dragonflight mount in the future?
Would be awesome, needs to make sense in context though Muffinus 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
if developers are confined by budget restraints, and they can't talk about them publicly, can they ever be honest?
Being honest with players and having 100% transparency on all things are two different beasts. OccupyGStreet 

wow is pretty tightly constrained by balance concerns. Wonder how wow might have developed without logs dbm or meters
Better. I think have all separately expressed frustration with the "Min/Max" obsession.
Yeah, when differences are 30%, I get it. OccupyGStreet 
When the balance "problems" are 2%, it's time to pay attention to real problems. OccupyGStreet
