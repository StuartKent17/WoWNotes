Patch 4.3.2 PTR Notes
The first World of Warcraft: Cataclysm patch of the year is in development and now available for testing on the Public Test Realms. This minor patch includes several updates that we were unable to apply via hotfixes , including the recently announced cross-realm raids , assorted class balance fixes, and more. If you'd like to help us test out this patch and provide feedback, you can start by copying your character  over to a test realm. Once you've had a chance to try things out, be sure to visit our Public Test Realm forum  to discuss the patch.

Classes: General

Vengeance is no longer triggered by receiving damage from other players.


 Druid Forums  / Talent Calculator  / Skills/Talents 

The Tier 13 Balance Druid 4-piece bonus now also increases the damage of Starsurge by 10%, in addition to its current effect.


 Hunter Forums  / Talent Calculator  / Skills/Talents 

Aspect of the Hawk now grants roughly 35% more attack power.
Deterrence now also reduces damage taken by 30% while active.
Black Arrow now ticks every 2 seconds for 20 seconds, as opposed to every 3 seconds for 15 seconds. The total damage dealt by the ability is unchanged.
Lock and Load no longer benefits Arcane Shot, nor is it consumed by Arcane Shot.


 Mage Forums  / Talent Calculator  / Skills/Talents 

Fireball damage has been reduced by roughly 6%.
Pyroblast damage has been reduced by roughly 6%.


 Paladin Forums  / Talent Calculator  / Skills/Talents 

Holy Radiance now costs 40% of base mana, up from 35%.


 Priest Forums  / Talent Calculator  / Skills/Talents 

Mass Dispel should again prefer dispelling targets that have magic effects that can be dispelled.


Dungeons & Raids

You can now form same-faction raids with Real ID friends, allowing you to enter Raid Finder in groups larger than 5, run older normal or heroic raids, or participate in Battlegrounds. You will not yet be able to run normal or heroic Dragon Soul with cross-realm raids of Real ID friends.
Several typo fixes and clarified descriptions have been added to the Dungeon Journal entries for Dragon Soul.
Players can no longer win multiple copies of the same item on a single Raid Finder boss kill. For example, a player who chooses Need on two set piece tokens or two weapons and wins the first, will not be eligible for the second on that particular boss.



Patch 4.3.2 64-bit PTR Client
Another new PTR build went out recently, with no significant changes. However, it did add a 64-bit version of the client!

A 64-bit client is now available for use with the 4.3.2 PTR. You can download it at the link below, unzip it into your PTR directory, and then run the executable to test it.



The 64-bit client is being distributed separately from the PTR as it is not yet supported for use with World of Warcraft.
This can only be used with the 4.3.2 PTR, it is not to be used with the live version of the game.
A Mac version is not available yet, though we are working on one and plan for it to be available in the near future.
The game’s built in voice chat does not currently work in the 64-bit client.

If you encounter any issues while using the 64-bit version, please report your findings in the PTR bug report forum , and return to using the 32-bit executable.

This is something we'd like to add into the game in some capacity, particularly to compliment the upcoming BattleTag system. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

LFR Difficulty Too Low
We actively encourage feedback on things such as the LFR, because we want to make it fun for everyone. Fun isn't wiping over and over because you have people in the group who are new to the raiding environment, or perhaps aren't up to speed on the latest tactics as you might expect from someone attending, say, an organised guild run. As we've said on numerous occasions, this is why we've designed LFR to be easier than normal raids, to enable a range of players — including less-experienced people or those with less-powerful gear — to see the content and gear up a little before perhaps trying it on normal, then later possibly heroic difficulty.

However, feedback in the form of threads like this is not what we are looking for, nor does it tell us anything useful. If you find LFR lacks challenge to the point where you feel you can leave your computer during an encounter, I'd suggest, like others here have done, that you join a raid on normal or heroic difficulty, which should test your skills sufficiently. Insulting the people LFR is aimed at will not be tolerated. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
