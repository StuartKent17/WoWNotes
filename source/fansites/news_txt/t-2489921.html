<br>
Raid Testing Schedule - June 7th<br>
On Friday June 7th, we will be conducting Mythic raid testing in The Eternal Palace.<br>
<br>
June, 7th<br>
<br>
Za&#x2019;qul, Harbinger of Ny&#x2019;alotha - Mythic Eternal Palace<br>
13:00 PDT (16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST)<br>
Blackwater Behemoth - Mythic Eternal Palace<br>
14:00 PDT (17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST)<br>
Orgozoa - Mythic Eternal Palace<br>
15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 24:00 CEST)<br>
<br>
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a test environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br>
<br>
Q: How do I get into the raid zone?<br>
A: In Zuldazar, Boralus, Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade III in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. (The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.)<br>
<br>
Q: What character should I use to test the raid?<br>
A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players&#x2019; effective level to 120 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounter(s) being tested.<br>
<br>
Q: How long does testing last?<br>
A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we&#x2019;re satisfied that we&#x2019;ve received that information for a given boss, we&#x2019;ll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.</div></div>
