Patch 7.1.5 Hotfixes - February 6-7
Dungeons and Raids

The Nighthold

Spellblade Aluriel

Mythic difficulty Lowered the damage done by Mark of Frost by 20%.
Mythic difficulty Lowered the damage done by Detonate: Arcane Orb by 10%.

Star Augur Etraeus

Mythic difficulty Increased the initial damage inflicted by Icy and Fel Ejection by roughly 40%, and their periodic damage by 100%.
Mythic difficulty Reduced the health of Star Augur Etraeus by 5%, and the health of Things That Should Not Be by 45%.

Developers’ Note: These changes are aimed at shifting some of the role-specific requirements of the encounter away from damage output in favor of healing, while slightly reducing the overall difficulty of the encounter on Mythic difficulty.





Holiday

Players should be able to place Love Fools in battlegrounds, as intended.


Items

Legion Legendary items can no longer be destroyed.

Developers’ notes: There was a rumor that deleting a Legendary item would increase your chances of receiving a different one. It’s completely false.

Priest

Unequipping the Blessed Dawnlight Medallion now resets your Insanity to 0.
Binding Heal will now properly reduce the cooldown of Holy Word: Serenity while Al’maiesh, the Cord of Hope is equipped.



Player versus Player

Warlock

Entrenched in Flame will now properly function with Shadowburn.



Classes

Hunter

With the Dire Frenzy talent, the Eagletalon Battlegear Beast Mastery 2-piece bonus should now grant your pet 10% increased damage for 15 seconds. This will not be reflected in the tooltip until Patch 7.2.



Items

Artifact Power won from bonus rolls will no longer display for other members of your group.


Player versus Player

Shaman

Earthbind Totem will no longer take unintended additional damage from player attacks.
Spirit Link http://www.wowdb.com/spells/204293's mana has been increased to 35% base mana was 15%.
Spirit Link http://www.wowdb.com/spells/204293's damage can no longer be mitigated by Absorption effects.
Spirit Link http://www.wowdb.com/spells/204293's duration has been reduced to 20 seconds.




Raid Testing Schedule - February 10
On Friday, February 10, we will be conducting a preliminary raid test of two Tomb of Sargeras Heroic bosses. This is as much a stress test and server-stability test as anything else, and these bosses will be revisited later on.

Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Mythic, of course, requires a fixed 20-player group.

Friday, February 10

Gornoth - Heroic Tomb of Sargeras
13:00 PST 16:00 EST, 22:00 CET

Harjatan - Heroic Tomb of Sargeras
14:00 PST 17:00 EST, 23:00 CET

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.

Q: How do I get into the raid zone?
A: In Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade Sr. in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.

Q: What character should I use to test the raid?
A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players' effective level to 110 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounters being tested. For 7.2 raid testing, we'll be granting players all the new 7.2 artifact traits IF players have done the quest to reveal those new traits. Complete the Broken Shore intro experience in order to access this quest.

Q: How long does testing last?
A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we're satisfied that we've received that information for a given boss, we'll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.

Q: Raid testing already? Only a handful of guilds have even finished Mythic Nighthold! Are you out of your damn minds?
A: We realize this is coming right on the heels of plenty of raid content on the live servers, and that competitive guilds feel like they need to get every bit of exposure to upcoming content in order to be properly prepared. It's not ideal timing, but it's a consequence of the way we're structuring our content releases, and something we're looking for ways to improve and continue to refine over the course of Legion. As we've said in the past, Tomb of Sargeras will not be available right when 7.2 unlocks, and a quest arc akin to the 7.1 Suramar Insurrection campaign will lead up to its opening. We certainly do not want to rush players through content faster than they can enjoy it - Nighthold is going to be the premiere raid for some time to come. 

But Tomb of Sargeras, at least as far as art assets, and most descriptive text, voice overs, and so forth goes, needs to be in patch 7.2 data. That means we need to begin testing it far earlier, relative to the date when the raid will actually go live, than we have in past expansions. But this week's test is just dipping our toes in the water to assess the stability of the overall testing environment, identify class bugs or server issues that might hinder raid testing, and get the process started.

These two bosses will be retested in the future, and likely more than once. There are weeks of raid testing to come, and it's exceedingly likely that testing for numerical tuning purposes and bug fixing will occur in a PTR environment even after 7.2 is on the live servers. If you can log on this Friday to help us test, that's of course much appreciated, but if not, please rest assured that there will be plenty of additional opportunities to come.

Mythic Dungeons
Appreciate all the feedback here - Mythics can be a bit contentious, and I've been in those situations where a person dropping out can ruin an entire run. It's definitely something on my radar.

Upping the cap on this thread for discussion as well. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/797958-why-are-people-so-opposed-to-mythics/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753236675?page=8#155

PTR Development Notes - Build 23530
Since there’s still a lot of testing to be done on the content we introduced last week, this week’s update will be a little bit lighter. That said, there’s still several new things being enabled for testing in this build.

This week fleshes out the Broken Shore zone a little more with the addition of the Sentinax: a Legion command ship that patrols the zone, sending in backup troops to certain areas when necessary. When it’s patrolling an area, you’ll be able to find Sentinax Beacons on nearby enemies. Use one of these beacons to cause the Sentinax to open demonic portals, which spawn more difficult creatures. When killed, those creatures drop Nethershards and crafting materials, as well as more powerful beacons that, in turn, summon more powerful creatures.

Paladins and Mages can unlock a couple new followers in this build. If you’ve quested in Ungoro, you may remember a fellow by the name of “Maximillian of Northshire.” Paladins who have completed that quest line will be able to recruit him to their cause for better or worse. Mages, on the other hand, will need to complete their class hall questline. Once that’s finished, the Great Akazamzarak – everyone’s favorite street magician – will have an important task for you. Help him out, and he’ll join you on your adventures.

We’re planning to do a light amount of raid testing this week, primarily to check for stability and catch any major show-stopping bugs. The “real” raid testing will start next week, once we’re confident the PTR is ready. We’ll have more details to share on that schedule in the coming days.

Finally, imagine a typical game of Warsong Gulch, where your team battles to capture the enemy’s flag while defending your own. Now imagine that you don’t need to defend your flag to capture theirs – just take a quick stroll across the battlefield with it and the point is yours. Oh, and there’s a whole bunch of extra flags. And some new powerups. You end up with something called “Warsong Scramble,” and that’s the next PvP Brawl up for testing. It’ll be available all week, but we especially hope to see you during Play with the Blues on Friday!

Those are the major features we’re opening up with this build, but we’re hoping to start testing on most of the remaining 7.2 content in the next week or so – including flying, class mounts, and several other bits. Thanks again, and happy testing!
