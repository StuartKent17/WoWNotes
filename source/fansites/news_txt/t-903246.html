The model for the updated molten giants are now in the game files! They look like super awesome version of the old Molten Core giants and you might recognize the face from the Warrior Tier 12 Model Preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2288-Tier-12-Models-Preview-Warrior).<br>

The Firelands: Lord Rhyolith &amp; Baleroc<br>
Blizzard updated their preview of the Firelands and added 2 bosses screenshots. Interestingly enough, Lord Anthrycist lost his controversial-weird name and is now named Ryolith. <br>
Hey all,<br>
<br>
We&apos;ve added new images for Lord Rhyolith and Baleroc [The Gatekeeper] to our patch 4.2 preview of the Firelands.<br>
<br>
You can check them out here: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2682944<br>

Raid Mechanics and making them more transparent<br>
Even so, it&apos;s not unreasonable for a player to feel that some of the game mechanics in World of Warcraft could be made more transparent, be that through additional interface options, better encounter alerts, or a type of in-game guide. That may not be the exact complaint here, but it&apos;s still valid and worthy of consideration.<br>
<br>
In fact, we agree that there&apos;s room for improvement. As already mentioned, we&apos;re introducing the Dungeon Journal in patch 4.2. While this new feature won&#x2019;t completely eliminate the need for one to &quot;study&quot; certain encounters, it should make it easier for players to pick up new fights, and hopefully a lot more fun (the journal looks pretty darn sweet, if you ask me, and even includes a little lore, too).<br>
<br>
Speaking to the future, we&apos;re also looking into ways that we can incorporate some &quot;raid/dungeon&quot;-style gameplay into solo environments. To a small degree, there&apos;s a bit of this in the new daily quest hubs coming up in in 4.2. While the goal isn&apos;t specifically to prepare players for dungeons and raids -- rather, just to make content that&apos;s fun and cool -- the quests themselves and some their related achievements encourage the use of tactics that you&apos;d might see in dungeon and raid encounters.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Burn Victims&quot; is a &quot;heal the wounded NPCs in the field&quot; type of quest, which will give players a salve to use on burn victims in the Molten Front. Healers will be able to use their healing spells, however, and complete the quest much more easily (since most heals are ranged).<br>
<br>
&quot;Strike at the Heart&quot; is a quest with randomized bosses, all of which have raid-style environmental damage. There&apos;s even an achievement (currently named &quot;Ready for Raiding II&quot;) for killing all five of those random bosses without taking damage from their avoidable environmental effects.<br>
<br>
Some other achievements in the areas promote more skilled, &quot;raid-style&quot; play, too. &quot;Flawless Victory,&quot; for example, asks players to solo kill a Molten Behemoth (found in the Molten Front) without taking any damage from two its abilities: Molten Stop and Fiery Boulder. And &quot;Master of the Molten Front&quot; requires players to kill a variety of flamewakers in arguably non-standard ways (e.g. pwning a Flamewaker Shaman with his own Flamewave).<br>
<br>
<br>
Although these quests won&apos;t magically turn an inexperienced raider into an experienced one, we think they have the chance to make the daily content more interesting, as well as provide more opportunities for players to familiarize themselves with the style of gameplay one can expect within a dungeon or raid.
