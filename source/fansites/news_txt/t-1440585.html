It&#x2019;s the New Year, and 2014 is going to be a big one for World of Warcraft. This November marks the game&#x2019;s 10-year anniversary and the 20-year anniversary of the entire Warcraft series. We&#x2019;re looking forward to celebrating these milestones with everyone, but in the meantime, we&#x2019;ve got a few Warlords of Draenor&#x2013;related updates to share.<br>
<br>
Preparing for Battle<br>
At BlizzCon, we laid out our plans to send you into battle against some of the biggest and baddest enemies in Warcraft history. While the Iron Horde gears up for war on Draenor, back here on earth we&#x2019;re making preparations for the expansion&#x2019;s upcoming closed beta test. If you&#x2019;d like to be considered, now&#x2019;s a great time to make sure you&#x2019;re opted in (https://www.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html) to Warcraft betas and that the hardware specs in your Beta Profile (https://www.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html) are up to date. (Full instructions can be found here (http://www.battle.net/support/en/article/beta-opt-in-instructions).)<br>

Report from the Front Lines<br>
From the outset, players will find themselves hurled into a chaotic conflict with the Iron Horde at a new Dark Portal on Draenor. The situation for Azeroth is grim, and the war effort needs heroes&#x2014;from new recruits to retired champions to warriors still tending wounds earned at the Siege of Orgrimmar. To get everyone straight to the action, when you buy the expansion, it will come with a boost to level 90 for one character on your WoW account. We&#x2019;re getting ready to test the functionality for that on the PTR, and we wanted to provide a quick update on how it will work with the upcoming expansion presales.<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor will be available for pre-purchase digitally Soon&#x2122;, and we&#x2019;re once again planning to have standard digital and Digital Deluxe versions (along with a physical Collector&#x2019;s Edition&#x2014;more on that at a later date). This time, if you pre-purchase the Digital Deluxe edition you&#x2019;ll get your exclusive World of Warcraft pet and mount right away, allowing you to bring a little bit of Draenor past into Azeroth present.<br>
<br>
In addition, when you pre-purchase either digital version, we&#x2019;re going to grant you your level-90 boost at the time of pre-purchase. That&#x2019;s a little different from the plan we laid out at BlizzCon, but based on the feedback, it&#x2019;s obvious that many of you would like the chance to get acquainted with a new class before heading into the expansion. This will also give more players the opportunity to experience the current end-game content and the events leading up to Garrosh&#x2019;s exodus to Draenor. Maybe you&#x2019;ll get your Legendary cloak from Wrathion and level 90&#x2013;100 Heirloom weapon in the process.<br>

<br>
Bolster the Ranks<br>
We&#x2019;ve also heard feedback from players that they&#x2019;d be interested in boosting multiple characters to 90, including alts they play with friends on other factions and realms. We&#x2019;ve been evaluating ways to make that possible without having players go through roundabout methods (such as purchasing multiple boxes and performing multiple character transfers), and in the near future we&#x2019;ll be testing out a feature that gives you the option to purchase a character upgrade directly. We&#x2019;ll have more information to share later&#x2014;including details on our character-upgrade plans for Asian regions where players don&#x2019;t buy expansion boxes&#x2014;but you&#x2019;ll start seeing pieces of the process soon on the PTR, so keep an eye out.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re looking forward to the closed beta test, and we&#x2019;re excited we&#x2019;re able to give players their character boost immediately upon pre-purchasing&#x2014;hopefully that will help tide you over while you&#x2019;re waiting for the epic battle for Draenor to begin. Stay tuned for more information on presales and our beta plans, and we hope you&#x2019;ll join in and help us test this stuff out when it hits the PTR.</div></div>
