Comic-Con visitors got another teaser for the Warcraft movie this year, but no footage has appeared as of yet. For now we have a short description thanks to comingsoon (http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=121083), SlashFilm (http://www.slashfilm.com/warcraft-teaser-trailer-comic-con-2014/), ScreenRant (http://screenrant.com/warcraft-movie-trailer-sdcc-2014/), IGN (http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/26/sdcc-2014-duncan-jones-gives-fans-their-first-look-at-warcraft), and io9 (io9):<br>
<br>
<br>
The movie focuses on the origin of conflict between Humans and Orcs in Azeroth.<br>
The story should be accessible to everyone, not just Warcraft fans.<br>
A human (Travis Fimmell (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1379938/)) wearing Alliance themed armor is up first. He wonders if he is a fool for spending so much time protecting his king and so little protecting his son.<br>
An orc was up next, noting that he had led thousands of warriors into battle but fears becoming a father, wondering if that makes him a leader or a coward.<br>
A giant throne, armory, green sky, gryphon, and other Warcraft elements appear in the teaser.<br>
Magic and melee fighting occur between the Orcs and Humans. Ben Foster (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004936/) appears as Medivh.<br>
SlashFilm (http://www.slashfilm.com/warcraft-teaser-trailer-comic-con-2014/) mentioned the Orcs are already Lord of the Rings quality, but ScreenRant (http://screenrant.com/warcraft-movie-trailer-sdcc-2014/) mentions that they look far from finished. <br>
Everyone seems to agree that the scenery looks great!<br>
