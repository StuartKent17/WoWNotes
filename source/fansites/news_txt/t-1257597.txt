PTR Class and Set Bonus Issues
We are making some additional changes. The ones below are mostly for PvP purposes and were based on a lot of PTR feedback, much of it from high-end PvP players. Until 5.2 goes live, these are not set in stone. 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Blind  - cooldown increased to 2 min from 90 sec.
Preparation  - no longer resets the cooldown of Cloak of Shadows 
Cloak of Shadows  - cooldown reduced to 60 sec from 2 min.


 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

We agree that Retribution does not offer enough benefits to an Arena or Battleground team beyond just taking a Holy paladin. We are going to try a change where Hand of Sacrifice  also dispels all harmful magic effects on the target for Ret only.


 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Phantasm  - no longer makes you untargetable. Movement protection increased to 5 sec from 3 sec.
Dispersion  - now belongs to the Shadow school, meaning it can get locked out.
We are expanding the Shadow healing nerf to most of the priest healing toolkit. This means Holy and Discipline will have a passive that increases all of their healing by 25% as do most other healing classes. Holy and Discipline should see no change as a result, but Shadow's heals will be weaker. Remember that this will be partially offset relative to 5.1 because Shadow does get some healing benefit from PvP Power. This note replaces earlier notes about Flash Heal  and Binding Heal  being nerfed for Shadow.


 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Blood Fear  is now Blood Horror and is a 4 sec horror effect instead of a Fear  It otherwise works as it does on the PTR.


 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Totemic Restoration  - now behaves as though any replaced or destroyed totem was active for a minimum of 1 sec, even if the totem is dropped and grabbed for a shorter time period.
Stone Bulwark Totem  - the totem now has 10% of the Shaman's health, much like Mana Tide and Healing Tide.
Nature's Guardian  - now preserves the Shaman's health percentage when it expires.


 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Second Wind  - we are reverting the nerf to the heal not working while stunned. We think we have nerfed Arms enough for PvP reasons in 5.2.


 Monk Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Paralysis  - duration is now 4 sec from the front / 6 sec from the back down from 4 / 8.


 Mage Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Glyph of Deep Freeze  - now also lowers the stun duration of Deep Freeze  by 1 sec in addition to taking Deep Freeze  off the GCD.
Ring of Frost  - Presence of Mind  will make RoF instant cast, but won't make it arm instantly.
PvP 2pc bonus - the reduction in cooldown on Counterspell  is now only applied if you successfully use Counterspell  to interrupt not Silence  a target.
