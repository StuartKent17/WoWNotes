Let’s Talk About Brawler’s Guild
Will gear levels be throttled for the fights so that progression raiders and/or PvPers have no preexisting advantage, and the bragging rights are solely based on player skill?
Stat scaling isn't currently planned for the Guild, no. Skill will absolutely factor in, especially at high Ranks, but bragging rights in this context can certainly also include raw character power. The fights aren't tuned for stat scaling, and beyond that, gear is an important part of World of Warcraft. We don't want to go too crazy with eliminating its value by over-using stat scaling. 

Naturally, and as with all things, we might revise that perspective in the future, but it's not on the table at the moment. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/243870-lets-talk-about-brawlers-guild/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7004406077?page=40#800

Water Jet
I don't think we've seen the last of it. Delayed is more likely than scrapped, I'd say.
I think that's a fair assessment. We weren't happy with how this spell was working out on the PTR, and pulled it for now. We're looking into giving it some more polish, and possibly implementing it when the time is right.

Rep is more "mandatory" for raiding than the head enchant was in Wrath/Cata since it gives you more advantage. 
There were no alternatives to head enchants. There are better pieces than every valor item. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261846540325363714

Was it a mistake 2 add talents that were available 2 each spec in cata available for an entire class. Arms getting shckwve etc 
We think that's what makes the talents fun. Choosing a spec for one ability was less so. 

If heal reduction in pvp isn't enough, would you consider mana regen nerf? Burst damage rules when mana is infinite, right? 

Not sure. A lot of healers in PvP complain about mana already. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/260869654296289281

Could u write a dev watercooler about class rotations; why it was important that arc mage/bm hunter got more buttons? 
Players complained that one-button-wonders could top meters, but others would complain if they paid a simplicity tax. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261150378538713089

"Movement should be terrible for a ranged spec. Full stop." Can you justify the hunter changes in light of that? 
Definitely worried that moving will be too good for hunters, but it was better than Aspect twisting. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261623016805502976

What's this new Tooth & Claw for druid bears in 5.1ptr? Just curious what gap it fills, add more variation? 
Maul is kind of a dead button since rage is better spent on defenses much of the time now. This is an attempt to solve that. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261941178021330944

I know you aren't ignoring MM, but do you really think the minor changes in 5.1 will be enough for it to be viable? 
We increased the duration of Steady Focus, which is both a quality of life and DPS increase. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261142746042073088

Do spirit beasts do more dps than regular pets since panda? 
That's not our intent. They shouldn't. We'll have to check if they don't if that's the contention. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/263076283905372160

<3 the Fox changes, but what about "ranged should lose DPS while moving"? Will u reintroduce a penalty like sniper training? 
We might reintroduce Sniper Training if hunters never stop moving, but not for 5.1. 

Nerfing froststorm breath? BM AOE is already horrible. Why nerf it more? 
I think data mining is picking up changes we hotfixed in weeks ago. Don't assume datamined tooltip changes are real changes. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261941798073679872

So I was curious to see the 5.1 patch notes contained nothing in regards to BM hunters having reduced damage output.?
Their damage output is fine. Their damage output in a short window is not, and that's where we targeted the changes. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/262966360496295936

Did the mage change to Invocation not make it in this last PTR patch? 
Not sure we're going to change it. Mages might stop Evocating ever. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/262253039073763328

Word of Glory has been bugged since MoP came out, being treated as a ranged attack. Doesn't work out of attack range or LoS 
It's because of the glyph of Harsh Words. Not sure how to fix. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/263074599644839936

Seriously do something about that Execution Sentence, it's pure garbage..don't make us all use Holy Prism 
Exec is the most popular last I looked. Might depend on your spec. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/263074304235819008

rPaladins Mastery: Hand of Light double dips from resilience, making it do half the damage. Any chance to make it ignore resi? 
We'll look at it. It happens in a few other places too Combustion maybe?. 

What's the deal with holy pallys having no damaging aoe? And don't say talents cover it 
Holy has great CC, decent mobility, lots of instants and good ranged damage. It's okay for them to have some limitations. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/262968405081092096

Any pvp buff for poor disc priest in pvp? 
Thinking of bringing Focused Will back. 
Dear God no, no disc priest in his or her right mind wants more Rapture. Mana return on archangel, sure. 
Not crazy about buffing Archangel. That makes Smite more mandatory. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/260776849964154880

What is your reason for buffing Mindbender instead of PW:Solace? Mindbender has now become mandatory. I hope solace gets buff. 
We haven't buffed Mindbender lately AFAIK. Solace was considered mandatory in beta. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/262970695686971392

Would you consider removing the group-target limitation from Prayer of Healing? It's starting to feel dated. 
Talking about it, but that does make PoH into Chain Heal / Holy Radiance. I do feel smart when I use PoH well. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/260869199457562624

Are you planning any Disc buff other than Mass Dispel? Disc is weak atm. 
We didn't change Mass Dispel except for Symbiosis version. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261145548667637760

Rogues don't find your game and many are going to quit if they don't see good changes in 5.1. Stop telling us what we find fun 

What if I tell you what I find fun and you tell me what you find fun & everyone stops trying to be the voice of the community. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261144129491316737

Was Cold Blood removed because of Shadow Blades? Would really love it back. Good on-demand burst & loved the visual. 
Cold Blood helped make rogues not care about crit as a stat. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261619496475820034

Can you guys make gag order prot only and usable against players. Think the change hurts prot flag carriers. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/260868941822439424
GC explain gag orders removal from pvp so i can understand why 
Warriors have high mobility and damage. If you escape them you should be somewhat safe and warriors always have Storm Bolt. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261147148735873024

Is recklessness granting immunity to fear intended? Currently It does, but the tooltip doesn't say so. 
It's a leftover bug. Fixed in 5.1 I believe. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261539936182861824

PvP warriors will lose silence on heroic throw. Its going to make us very weak against ranged classes with snares. 
I understand, but if you can easily counter anything thrown at you, the other guy has no options. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261150152901935104

H throw silence is skillless? How about counter spell etc True they should get rid of all blanket silence
We don't think HT silence is "skillless." It was just too much with all the other tools and we didn't want to hurt e.g. mobility. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261966351827083265

Warrior Cd stacking was bad, but losing the rage from avatar will really hurt, any plans to buff some sustained dmg?
We increased the duration to offset the rage loss. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261990106477514752

Shield block allows skilled warriors to play both offensive & defensive when needed. DBTS is just pop & keep bursting, boring.
I like the idea of Shield Block but don't you think many warriors will just complain more about needing shields for defense? 
DBTS also replaced both retalitation & shield block. Warrior went from the most rewarding class to a one-dimensional class imo 
DBTS was an answer to all those warriors who hated to have to use a shield for Shield Wall.
If you made wep. swap intuitive part of Warrior kit ie, base UI support / Druid GCD leniency, would go over better 
Yeah agree. Would love to do this. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/262278800098877440

Regarding Cold blood response... Does warrior not care about crit because of recklessness? 
Warriors have extra mechanics to make crit more valuable. Note that we did lower it from 100% to 50% a couple of expansions ago. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/262966583675203584
