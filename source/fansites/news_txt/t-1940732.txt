Legion - Account Wide Challenge Mode Weapon Transmog
The long asked question about transmogging Challenge Mode weapons has finally been answered! 
Will players that completed WOD challenge modes unlock all the weapon models for xmog? If not seems unfair to some classes.
In #Legion you will be able to purchase a token that will unlock all Challenge Mode weapon appearances account-wide!

To clarify, only players who have completed all the Warlords of Draenor Challenge Mode Golds will be able to buy this token. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/399258-draenor-cm-weapons-legion-transmog/ / Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17288700635?page=1#11

Yep! Glad to hear this has gotten around, as we haven't been ignoring this topic at all. In fact, this is something that we've been discussing for quite some time. We wanted to be certain that we could completely decided on the plans for these weapons before we said anything. 

We'd rather not make promises we aren't completely certain we can keep. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/399234-wod-cm-weapon-transmogging-in-legion-resolved/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20419913969?page=2#30

The first 1:30 of this video is the same intro as Shadow Priest, so feel free to skip it if you still remember what happens. 

This intro rewards you with Light's Wrath http://beta.wowdb.com/items/128868-lights-wrath. You can see all of the models for it on our Artifact Weapons page http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/985-Legion-Artifact-Weapons.

FEEDBACK: Violet Hold Normal
Violet Hold is open and updated for Legion! We'll have a video soon, but it still plays much like the previous version.
Please use this thread to post any feedback on the Violet Hold dungeon. When posting, please note your group composition and any relevant information about the nature of your group e.g. random LFG group, Mythic raider guildmates, etc.. At this stage, a lot of overall combat balance is in flux, but we're still very interested in hearing overall feedback and impressions of the experience and mechanics.

Killed all trash up to first boss, Anub'esset spawned as first escaped prisoner. We killed it and we never got credit for killing "First Escaped Prisoner" and then had to leave because nothing would spawn.
Thanks for the report - we have a fix going out shortly that should resolve this issue.

Necrolytes are a creation of Gul'dan, warlocks trained in necromancy per WC2. WoW Magazine states Necrolytes used void, making
warcraft 1 initially, trained by kil'jaeden, very demonic in nature, hence a warlock thing Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/689707949971767296


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.

I liked you and still do, I just don't agree much with your homogenize everything.
Without some of that, paladins and druids were doomed to heal. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689542825105498112

has a point; some of the "homogenization" done to wow classes helped allow pallies, druids, etc to do more then "role x"
I feel we and I take blame were too sensitive to player concerns about e.g. I can't compete on AE damage on this one fight. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689605237846335489
I don't apologize for breaking up bringing the shaman for lust and that's the only reason to bring them. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689605784678768642
When we first made DKs, raids told us they couldn't bring them because they didn't fit in the raid group Tetris. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689606498947731456
So we said it should be about bringing competent players not about classes with mandatory buffs. That was "Bring the player." OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689606740065685506
So if I could do it again, I would homogenize less but still wouldn't advocate "You must bring me since I buff Shadow damage" OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689607313989042176
