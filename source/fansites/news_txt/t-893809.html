Patch 4.1 Hotfixes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2268-Patch-4.1-Hotfixes)<br>

Arena and RBG Conquest Change<br>
In patch 4.1 the amount of Conquest earned for both Arenas and Rated Battlegrounds has been changed to a flat amount regardless of team rating, to 135 and 335 respectively. This change should of course have been in the patch 4.1 notes, but due to a fairly straight forward error, was not included.<br>
<br>
The current reward now in 4.1 for winning an Arena match is 135 Conquest Points, and for Rated Battlegrounds it&apos;s 335 Conquest Points. We&apos;re currently evaluating these amounts as we believe they are potentially lower than they need to be, and we&apos;ll of course let you know if they need to be changed.</div></div>
