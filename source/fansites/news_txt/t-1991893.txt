Legion Developer Update, Live May 10!
Development of the World of Warcraft: Legion expansion is well underway, and we’d like to take some time to update everyone on how things are progressing.

Assistant Game Director Ion “Watcher” Hazzikostas will be joined by online gaming personality Jesse Cox to discuss a number of topics, including Class Halls, max-level content, the Demon Hunter, and a status update on what our next priorities are for Legion development.

We’ll be going live at 9:00 AM Pacific/12:00 PM Eastern time on the official World of Warcraft Twitch channel at twitch.tv/Warcraft. We’ll see you then!


Legion - The Broken Shore Horde
The Horde version of the Broken Shore intro is in. It is very similar to the Alliance one, just with different characters. Cinematics and voice acting are still missing, but there is an interesting Horde specific part starting at 14:15 https://youtu.be/FNuCbc4hQUU?t=855. There are spoilers in this video.

Legion - Empowered Ring of the Kirin Tor Updates
The latest build converted Intellect to Stamina on this ring and increased the price from <span class="money-gold" alt="g">50,000</span> to <span class="money-gold" alt="g">200,000</span>.

Sminx Glasseye http://beta.wowdb.com/npcs/93543-sminx-glasseye sells the Empowered Ring of the Kirin Tor http://beta.wowdb.com/items/139599-empowered-ring-of-the-kirin-tor for <span class="money-gold" alt="g">200,000</span>. The vendor currently belongs to the old Kirin Tor faction, so it is possible there will be reputation discounts.

Legendary Item Feedback
There's a new Flaskataur in town, adorned with elemental crystals and a rather dapper hat. 

You can find the Legendary Flaskataur in Orgrimmar, Stormwind, and Dalaran, near the instance teleport NPC, Donjon Rade. He sells all available legendaries, but of course you can only equip one at a time.

Please use this thread to discuss them, and give feedback on how they feel, how much you can break the game with them, and so forth. Enjoy!

For the purposes of this thread, let's assume everyone in raids has one, but only one, and can't control which one it is. And assume they work in all non-PvP content, at all times, including world-first Mythic progression. Which ones are most worrisome? Which are coolest?

I also fully understand that a decent chunk of the posters here might prefer Mythic raiding if it gear didn't matter at all and success were only a product of skill and time investment, and thus will hate this. But please, humor me, and let's keep the thread focused on items themselves. Which ones seem like they have the most potential to break balance? Which seem underwhelming, such that you'd be disappointed at getting them instead of one of the others?


Mythic/Mythic+ Dungeons Feedback
Ok, so in today's build, all dungeons except Assault on Violet Hold are open on Mythic difficulty. When you create a keystone, either using the purchased item or by beating a higher-level Mythic dungeon within the timer, it should randomly point to any of them.

There's a bug with the placement of the Challenge Pedestal in Court of Stars it's, uh, not subtle which we'll try to fix shortly.

Tuning may be a bit scattershot on this - I'm definitely interested in hearing which dungeons seem easiest, which seem hardest, which have the most or least strict timers, etc.

Pretty comfortably beat the timer 6-8 minutes remaining I forget, logs are weird on a GR6 Raging/Necrotic Neltharion's Lair. Challenge at i845 is probably too high for the i840 loot at the end but the instance at GR6 felt pretty well tuned for that ilevel would be a different story with Tyrannical of course.
The loot levels you're seeing aren't final - you're currently seeing the same base ilvl regardless of completion level. I'd expect more like 855+ from the chest at the end of a level 6.

In general, I'd say you're doing these quite undergeared if you're pushing levels 6 and 7. The dirty secret of these tests is that we're using great players as guinea pigs to get a sense of how far beyond a given numerical threshold skill can take you. Some affixes e.g. Volcanic are more skill checks that you can play around. Others Tyrannical most notably have less finesse and don't let you compensate for lacking gear with skill in the same way. 

In terms of tuning, for the gear level 845 to which we're scaling you, I'd say "par" would probably be around a level 2, in terms of a point where it feels about like what a base Mythic dungeon would feel when you're doing it in Heroic dungeon gear.

new affixes are bolster & overflowing currently, as a random aside the trash contribution requirements to most of the dungeons we have completed thus far seem really low which is going to result in a lot of skipping even w/o using invis pots or a full stealth group to get by trash
Would love to hear more examples. Squishei's linked videos above seemed pretty close to the mark, with the bar filling up during the bit of trash before the final boss in each dungeon. Eye of Azshara is a really tricky one because of how wide-open the layout is, and how much you can avoid without having to use stealth/invis shenanigans. In general, the Enemy Forces step is tuned around killing the vast majority of the unavoidable enemies on your way to the boss. If you can slip past patrols naturally, then you're rewarded for that but of course if you wipe you have to deal with doing so a second time. Stealth and invis may let you selectively skip a couple of packs to earn your contribution requirement on easier ones, but that feels like an acceptable level of benefit from utility as opposed to a gamebreaking one.


Blue Posts
Tanking and Positioning
I would honestly agree with the devs if one of them came out and gave the canned response that mobs surrounding you is "working as intended". Though I have experienced rare and inconsistent quirks such as a mob that moves with you when you're trying to reposition around it or ones that continue standing on top of you even when you're trying to take a step back for space or facing requirements.
It definitely isn't working as desired and is something we're actively looking into. It is, in fact, quite annoying for monsters to stay all up in your business at all times.

Holy Paladin Feedback -- Build 21570 -- 27-Apr
The next build after today's, I believe, will have the BoSac artifact trait fixed. Then we can get a better sense of how deadly the ability is without the damage being incorrectly increased, and go from there.

The same build will likely have a redesign of Beacon of the Savior. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/409992-holy-paladin-feedback-build-21570-27-apr/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743604386?page=2#38

Affliction Warlock Feedback -- Build 21655 -- 5-May
In next build:
1 The initial mana cost of Drain Life and Drain Soul is removed, which should be a noticeable cost reduction overall.

2 Agony shard generation somewhat reworked: it will be higher on 1 target, and lower on 3 or more targets. In addition, it will be more consistent in all cases, in terms of time between shards.

Role Forums Shutdown
We gave forewarning that we'd be retiring these forums just a little over a week ago about 10 days. They don't serve the same purpose they once did and there is more activity on the specific class forums. Given that we're in a transition between expansions, this allows us the opportunity to reorganize a bit and refocus discussions.

Back when the role forums were introduced, we were told it's because Blizzard basically ignores the class forums entirely and considers them echo chambers. The role forums were meant to be the area to provide more balanced feedback for consideration, since it brought together a wide variety of perspectives and not just people clamoring for buffs for their own class. Has this policy shifted then?

I'm not sure anyone said "ignore" specifically though I could be wrong more like "it's easier to get x feedback" since there was a different type of synergy between classes at the time. It was a different time and things change. Feedback continues to come via many routes and we'll still be keeping an eye on it all.


Legion Alpha Known Issues
Known Issue - NVIDIA + DirectX 11
Some NVIDIA card users may experience graphic driver issues with this build if they are running DirectX 11. If you start seeing your client freeze and popup warnings about your NVIDIA drivers please switch your WoW Client to run using Direct X 9. This will take a client restart to take effect. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/410772-known-issue-nvidia-directx-11/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743814200?page=1#1

Known Issue - Auras not updating
Today's build contains several issues with auras:

Buffs and Debuffs will sometimes not display on your target frame and focus target frame. Buff icons do not always fade away when the aura has expired from the target. Switching targets will display buffs from the previous target and not update for the new target. 


Apologies for any inconvenience this causes, we know auras are pretty important for combat but we weren't able to commit a fix for these issues in time for this build.

Legion - Mobile App Icons
The latest Legion build added an interesting texture in the Garrison folder of Interface textures named MobileAppIcons. Several of these icons are also present in another texture called ClassHallMissionListIcons.
