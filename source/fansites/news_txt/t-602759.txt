2.3 Daily quests
Earlier in the day I noticed that I didn't post about the new 2.3 daily quests, that's a big error because this is probably one of the main feature of the 2.3 You'll be running them every day !. 

The battleground quests gives marks, gold, and honor.
The dungeon quests give [item=29460] used in Netherstorm to get "free" reputation with one of the following faction random : Cenarion Expedition / Consortium / Keepers of Time / Lower City / The Sha'tar / Sporeggar and people will laugh at you for this one
The cooking quests give you various cooking reagents and also has a chance to give you one of the new recipe. See the list in the craft section of the 2.3 information post

Update : The 2k honor reward might be wrong, if anyone can confirm/deny in comments I'd be very happy.
Update 2 : 2k honor for the AV daily confirmed, not sure if it changes with the other BGs but I doubt it. 
Update 3 : The reward still shows up a 209 for some people ... possible PTR bug ? 


     

Season 3 weapon model change / recolor preview
I forgot to update the new skin of the [item=33766] yesterday, so here it is. Also included another recolor preview from Endarion, showing recolored Hyjal blades and ZA guns. Note that most of this recolor aren't used in game yet and they don't mean tons of new weapons, most of the probably won't even be used, the original model isn't even used yet


   

More to come today if I'm not lazy.
