Please note that the Armory won&apos;t be available during the sale. <br>
To further ensure ticket sales for this year&apos;s BlizzCon remains a smooth process for everyone who intends to purchase tickets, we&apos;ll be temporarily taking down the World of Warcraft Armory. This is being done to further alleviate potential load on our website.<br>

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</div></div>
