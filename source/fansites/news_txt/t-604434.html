Sunwell loots - Take 2<br>
Don&apos;t rush the screenshots, it&apos;s the same as yesterday. However, the original screenshot had a few details I didn&apos;t notice in the first place : new item icons. Maybe it will help people who still can&apos;t decide if it&apos;s a fake or not. <br>
<br>
Top left part of the screen shows the icons of what look like a few swords, possibly a staff, and a shield. Bottom left look like a bunch of two-hand swords, the one in the top middle look like a staff or another 2h sword, and at the top right we&apos;ve got some kind of purple crystal and a shield (this one doesn&apos;t look new though, can&apos;t really tell on the screenshot).<br>
<br>
For more details about this please read yesterday&apos;s post<br>

Rogue bugs - Stealth/Vanish and Cheating Death<br>
Hortus posted about two bugs affecting rogues, one of them is another fix for stealth/vanish and will probably make most of the rogues very happy.<br>
I&apos;d like to inform everyone that the issue with Stealth and Vanish breaking 5 seconds after sapping or breaking stealth has been identified and a fix is being worked on. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4071474405&amp;postId=41178064022&amp;sid=1#0))<br>
<br>
I&apos;ve looked into this issue. In order to assure that that a worse bug (which caused cheat death to not work at all) did not occur under specific timing circumstances Cheat Death will sometimes reduce damage by 99% instead of 90%. Although technically this is a bug, it is not one that we can currently fix. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3881821791&amp;postId=41178064391&amp;sid=1#44))<br>

US Realms - Free character migration<br>
Free character migration once again for players playing on US realms. <br>
We will be offering free character moves from selected high population realms to lower populated realms, assisting in population dispersal. The ability to move a character on the selected source realms will become available on Tuesday, January 22 at 1:00 PM PST, and are scheduled to run until Tuesday, January 29 at 1:00 PM PST.<br>
<br>
In the event that a realm meets our transfer goals before the scheduled end date, the transfers to that realm will be disabled. We highly recommend that if you are planning to transfer that you do so at your earliest convenience. No characters will be eligible for these free moves once the transfers have been closed.<br>
<br>
Once the transfers open you can begin your transfer by visiting the Character Move page located here: https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html (https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html)<br>
<br>
The realms chosen consist of source realms with the highest sustained queues, and destination realms with the lowest population. The numbers gathered are directly from our data, and depict the realms in most need of these transfers. We will be continuing to monitor all realms and open additional free transfers in the future where necessary.<br>
