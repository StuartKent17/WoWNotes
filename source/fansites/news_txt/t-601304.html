This morning, someone sent me a video from Pacifism (http://www.pacifismguild.com). The guy who mailed it didn&apos;t seem to be from the guild so I asked their officers if I could post it and .... They accepted. They of course didn&apos;t kill him but it show the first two phases of the fight, which is always better than a few screenshots. Thanks again to Pacifism (http://www.pacifismguild.com) for allowing us to reupload it on google vid and post it, it was one on their first try and it was 2:00 AM, and actually the attempt look nice. (The video is from live servers)<br>

Kael&apos;thas<br>
For The Horde (http://www.for-the-horde.de) could experience more tries on Kael&apos;thas tonight with the help of a GM (on the PTR).<br>
They reached the final phase of the fight and we&apos;ve got a few screenshots ... But they also frapsed it, which means that a movie is on the way. <br>
