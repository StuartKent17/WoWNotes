Mike Morhaime Interviews 
Mike Morhaime, co-founder and former President of Blizzard Entertainment, recently attended GameLab in Barcelona to accept an award. During interviews with VG247, he was asked about his non-compete contract  and about why Heroes of the Storm failed 


His non-compete ended in April, and he is free to pursue whatever he wants. 
He is currently in the brainstorming phase, and doesn't have anything concrete to share yet.
Some of his ideas are games, some of them are not. 
He thinks the Heroes of the Storm team made a great game, but it was a little too late. 
One of his biggest regrets was not pursuing Dota early enough. 
There were more people playing Dota than Warcraft 3.
Blizzard had their hands' full supporting World of Warcraft.
If he could go back in time he would have had a team start doing something with Dota before the launch of Starcraft 2.
