It's a big big BIG world out there, but don’t worry about getting lost, there will be course markers and spectators along the way to help keep you on track. You’ll even see a few familiar faces among the onlookers!

Stranglethorn Vale is a dangerous place for low-level characters so you may want to find some muscle to join you along the way for a little extra protection. If you’re a higher-level character, think about playing chaperone for a gnome.

Whether short or tall, it will be a good time for all.

Recent Actions Against Terms of Use Violations
We’ve recently taken action against a number of accounts that were that were found to be using third-party programs that automate gameplay. These programs commonly called cheats, bots, or hacks automate certain aspects of gameplay, or provide unintended advantages and abilities to the player. This type of cheating undermines other players' experience and severely upsets the balance of the game environment.

As a reminder, in order to ensure fair play and competitive integrity, we closely monitor these and other activities that violate the Terms of Use.

We’re committed to providing an equal and fair playing field for everyone in World of Warcraft, and will continue to take action against those found in violation of our Terms of Use. Cheating of any form will not be tolerated.

Diversity Meet-Up at BlizzCon
The Blizzard community is global and diverse, and this is something we cherish. We’re proud of how our players and our workforce reflect the spectrum of cultures, genders, sexual orientations, and interests that make up the world we live in—it’s cool we’re not all the same. It helps make life more interesting and rewarding. That’s why we think it’s important to find new ways to recognize who we are as a global community. We know that this is important to many others in the community too. Time and time again, we’re inspired by how our players celebrate and support each other’s differences.

With that in mind, we’re excited to introduce a new space at BlizzCon this year that we’re calling the Blizzard Diversity Meet-Up.

The Diversity Meet-Up is for all attendees who are interested to join discussions about diversity in gaming and in life. One of our loftier goals for the space is to make it a place for people to share their experiences as they relate to diversity and inclusivity, whether in our games or within our community. To that end, we’re going to encourage group discussions, and Blizzard employees will be there to share their stories as well. We’re also there to answer any questions attendees may have about how Blizzard is supporting diversity from a workforce and hiring standpoint.

We see the Blizzard Diversity Meet-Up at BlizzCon as a celebration of our community and another way to enrich how we interact with each other. That’s the inspiration for bringing it to the show. We look forward to seeing you there, hearing your ideas and experiences, sharing our own, and coming together as we do every year to embrace our inner geek and everything else that makes us who we are.

We have some incredibly gifted artists in the World of Warcraft community. To celebrate a few of the talented players out there, we’re excited to introduce a new video series: The Fine Art of Fan Art.

We’ve been treated to paintings and drawings, sculptures and statues, machinima, cosplay, and so much more. Now we’re taking a closer look at the work that goes into some of these amazing projects.

In our first episode, we meet Thomas Karlsson—a digital artist from Sweden who brings the magic of Warcraft to life with a flick of his stylus. Check out the video below to learn more about Thomas, discover what inspires him, and follow his process as he creates an epic Varian Wrynn-inspired scene.

Stay tuned for the next installment of The Fine Art of Fan Art, coming soon.
