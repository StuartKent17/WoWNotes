Glorious Conquest Vendors Removed Until 5.3<br>
The Glorious Conquest PvP quartermasters (Acon Deathwielder for the Horde and Ethan Natice for the Alliance) will be removed to refit the items that they sell before patch 5.3 arrives. Glorious Conquest PvP gear is being changed from item level 512 to item level 496, but this wasn&#x2019;t a change that could be applied via a hotfix. In the meantime, we wanted to avoid a situation where players intending to purchase upgrades would buy these items, only to find that they had purchased cosmetic items when they are reduced to their new item levels with the arrival of patch 5.3.<br>
<br>
You can read about the coming item changes in the PvP Gear in Patch 5.3 blog (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/9331806). See you on the battlefield!<br>

Cross-Realm Zones and Pandaria<br>
While blue feedback is always appreciated, to me this came off as dodging the question. Can you say definitively you will not crz Pandaria (at least until next xpac) ? <br>
To the best of my knowledge, there are no plans to change how things are working for outdoor areas in Pandaria at this time.

UI / Addons<br>
better solution would be to add arena focus 1-5 and arena target 1-5 on the key binding options (cont..)<br>
We&apos;d actually like to do that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321714765867134976))<br>
<br>
Many popular addons like Questhelper have become baseline over time. Why of all things do map coordinates still need an addon?<br>
Nothing in the game itself uses coordinates, does it? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327525396243431424))<br>

Agree, but for example Minfernal is not fun to farm. Always 5-8 ppl camping out.<br>
The challenge of rare anything is players want them to be rare to everyone but them. If they aren&apos;t rare, they lose value. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/290184464800292864))<br>
<br>
do devs see idling folks in Felwood camping Minfernals as an issue? CRZ + long spawn times = many folks in small area.<br>
The idea behind rare spawns is they&apos;re hard to get. If there are fewer folks competing, we&apos;d just decrease spawn rates to compensate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324580705982107648))<br>

Hey GC. Is there a specific lore-reason why flying is disabled in Silvermoon City/Eversong Woods, or just an oversight?<br>
Making Silvermoon flyable would take longer than it took to make Stormwind flyable. Just wasn&apos;t built with that in mind. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322392312065953793))<br>

Misc<br>
So at the end of cataclysm I remember reading a post mortem of things you learned. I&apos;m curious what you&apos;ve learned from mists?<br>
Hmm. I&apos;d say two things off the top of my head. 1) We wanted to offer options but didn&apos;t offer *enough* options (e.g. GL). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327192236460748800))<br>
2) As many difficulty levels as we offered, it wasn&apos;t enough. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327192318602002433))<br>
I said 2, but also we didn&apos;t do a good job of providing direction at L90. Also wish we had added some dungeons in maybe 5.3. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327192531836219392))<br>
When I said &quot;not enough direction at 90&quot; I meant that you probably wanted to get better gear but weren&apos;t sure how or where or in what order. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327542217596092416))<br>
<br>
It makes 0 sense to share data with people that don&apos;t have the knowledge to interpret it correctly.<br>
Ultimately, we don&apos;t want to be in the position of having to ask community permission every time we want to make a change. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327193667938959360))<br>
Which is how I think it would feel if we had to defend every data point to every challenger. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327193740072591364))<br>
<br>
Pretty disappointed in any event, hope this doesn&apos;t turn out to be another &quot;TRISPEC! ...nvm, just kidding&quot;<br>
We have to be able to use our PTR builds to actually test stuff. Please don&apos;t use PTR as some kind of press release. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/326423902026878976))<br>
what you use the public TEST realm for testing? What kind of ass backward development methodology is that?<br>
I don&apos;t fault players. Data mining and sometimes even our patch notes represent any change as a fact not an experiment. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/326446561242529794))<br>
<br>
do you think listening to players too much has changed the game in a negative way? I enjoyed TBC more despite the imbalances.<br>
Overall, I&apos;d say no. But I agree there is a risk there. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/326421833664585729))<br>
If you implement too many suggestions, you end up with everything meh instead of having some things feel really awesome. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/326421927939952640))<br>
