Lightning Conduits - While Lei Shen is in range of a Lightning Conduit he will power it, granting him an additional ability specific to that Lightning Conduit. The energy level of the Conduit increases the longer Lei Shen is charging it, increasing damage dealt by the granted ability. When the Conduit's power reaches 100 energy, it will increase the level of the Conduit, and the Conduit's energy will reset to 0.

North Conduit: Static Shock - Lei Shen charges the target with Static Shock after 8 sec. Static Shock inflicts 1,000,000 Nature damage divided among all players within 8 yards. As the level of the Static Shock Conduit increases, the number of targets Lei Shen afflicts with Static Electricity will also increase.
East Conduit: Diffusion Chain - Inflicts 100,000 Nature damage, chaining to nearby enemies. When an enemy is hit by Diffusion Chain, a Diffused Lightning spawns at the location. As the level of the Diffusion Chain Conduit increases, the spawned Diffused Lightning elementals grow more powerful.

Diffused Lightning - Diffusion Chain creates a Diffused Lightning for every target it strikes. Diffused Lightning's attacks cause Chain Lightning. In Heroic, the Diffused Lightning will fixate on the player that it spawned from.

South Conduit: Overcharge - Lei Shen Overcharges a target player. The player becomes rooted and after 6 sec causes Overcharge to burst, creating a torus of electric energy around the target to quickly expands creating a ring with a safe area in the middle. Inflicts 150,000 Nature damage, stunning effected targets for 3 sec. As the level of the Overcharge Conduit increases, the number of targets Lei Shen afflicts with Overcharge will also increase.
West Conduit: Bouncing Bolt - Lei Shen conjures Bouncing Bolts that target random locations on the ground. Each Bolt inflicts 110,000 Nature damage split among enemies within 6 yards. If the Bouncing Bolt does not impact with an enemy, an Unharnessed Power is formed, and the Bouncing Bolt will bounce again. As the level of the Bouncing Bolt Conduit increases, the number of Bouncing Bolts that Lei Shen conjures will also increase.

Unharnessed Power - When Bouncing Bolts impact the ground and are not absorbed by enemies, an Unharnessed Power is unleashed.


Stage One: Thunderstruck! - Lei Shen equips his Axe, Thunder, which he can throw with deadly accuracy and cause lightning to strike the ground wherever it lands. Lei Shen will charge any Conduit that he is near.

Rated Battleground Exploitation & Win Trading
Players have been banned for exploiting, see this thread on ArenaJunkies http://www.arenajunkies.com/topic/235821-blizzard-ddos/.
Providing an environment where players can compete in the spirit of fair play is extremely important to us, particularly in rated Player versus Player combat. As part of that commitment we regularly monitor gameplay, and have discovered an issue where some Rated Battleground teams have exploited the queuing system to obtain high team ratings and engage in win trading. 

These, and all, exploitative activities are absolutely prohibited. We will investigate the situation carefully, and players that have been found to have participated in exploitation will be subject to the appropriate actions against their World of Warcraft accounts. In the meantime, we are currently working to resolve any remaining issues with the queue system to prevent this behavior in the future.

Cross Realm Arena Teams
It would definitely be cool to team up with friends who are playing on realms other than your own for arena. A while back, Ghostcrawler said on Twitter that he would also like to see cross-realm arena teams in World of Warcraft, however at this point in time we don't have any plans to implement a feature that enables you to search for or create an arena team cross-realm.

WoW Over Time
So in summary, the communities are still there, it's just that by default you don't have to belong to them any more, you need to actively want to participate in them. Seems to me that this caters to everybody better than being excluded from a large amount of content just because you couldn't find a group.
I personally think this is quite true. 

The picture linked by the OP is one that I think speaks to a lot of us who have been playing this game for years, it certainly speaks to the nostalgic old-timer in me, and it made me think back on some of those early guilds I was in and the good times I had back then... I think most of us will never forget that great first guild we were in where great bonds of friendship were established while learning the game and playing together.

Not all guilds stand the test of time, just like not all real life friendships stand the test of time. People grow apart, and so does guilds. In real life I sometimes wonder how old friends of mine I haven't seen in years are doing, or what happened to my old class mates that I used to have such a good time with, but since those days I have made new friends and formed new great friendships and those are the ones that matter today. 

I have friends on my friends lists in-game who I do not see log in any more for various reasons. Some have re-rolled, some are playing on their alts, some have moved to another realm, some have quit, etc. But while many old friends on my friend are no longer active, I should never forget that I have many other friends on my friends list who are still playing, and some of those friends I didn't have before when my old friends were active. In fact my friends list has grown ever since it became possible to add RealID and BattleTag friends, and I am still having just as much fun playing with friends today as I did back in the old days, even if those friends I play with are not the same as the old ones.

Content Difficulty Feedback
Simple - Normal Elegon and HC elegon are two different things and aimed for imo to two different kind of audiences. No ?
There aren't really different audiences that you can put on neat little boxes, though. Of course, hardcore players will get first to the Heroic boss, and will have an easier time fighting him. But there's nothing that prevents a "normal" player from becoming "hardcore", the thing is, that's something progressive, you don't become a hardcore raider overnight, so what is just hard enough for you as a Heroic boss is still easy for the person to your left, but too hard for the person to your right. 

This means it's not as simple as saying "hey, if you can't kill Elegon Heroic, stick to normals, that's your place". Because there'll surely be players that are right in-between, normals too easy for them, heroics still too hard.

We improve in life and in game trough experience and personal perks, but if experience is too simple and fire does not burn and voidzone does not kill - we do not learn to move from fire. If dragon's tail does not bend, we do not learn to stand on its side.
This is definitely true. The gaming scene has changed a lot over the last 20 years, though. 

While it was something very restricted to people with computers and an interest in videogames back then, now it's something mainstream where a grandmother or a complete illiterate in computers can insert a disc and start playing. And so the games, the genres, and the media itself has adapted to its new demographic. A decade ago or so, a MMO with varying difficulties, tools to find other players in a convenient way, etc, would have been seen by many as unconceivable, yet nowadays, there're players that pretty much expect those things to be in a game before they consider trying it.

[Suggestion] Bring back the Night!
Wow! Alright alright, we hear you. This seems almost like a unanimous opinion on this thread…
We’ll let the devs know how you feel about this. Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/252239-suggestion-bring-back-the-night/ / Official Forums http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6297803551?page=7#123

Racials Feedback
Racials have an intrinsic inequality; it’s very hard to get away from that if we want to make them all very distinctive at the same time. I wouldn’t dare to insult your intelligence by defending that racials are all perfectly balanced. Clearly they are not, but we also need to realize that there are two sides to this game, and for PvE for example, EMFH suddenly just doesn’t seem so op anymore, except on very specific encounters where a “PvP trinket” effect would give you more uptime.

It has been stated before that devs aren’t too happy about racials and our most distinguishable anthropomorphic crabbie even went so far as to say that if he were to design WoW from scratch, there would be no racials. The thing is, racials have been a part of the game for so long that everyone likes them and is used to the differentiation they provide, racials were designed with the intent of being some of the most distinctive abilities in the game, shaping distinct traits and providing identity to each of the different races.

That is not to say that there’s nothing we can do about it, far from that, devs are already aware of this issue so you already have their attention, perfecting balance is part of the persistent balancing and tuning of WoW. Keep providing us with feedback and suggestions for different racial implementations that you feel are balanced and highly distinctive both for PvE and PvP at the same time, and I’m sure devs will appreciate it, good ideas are always welcome here at Blizzard and many good ideas that make it into our games can actually be traced back to our community.

Regarding Blinding Light nerf: Why don't you just make Repentance replace HoJ like FoJ, to reduce CC to 2 instead of 3?
That's interesting. Would like to see more discussion on it. Repent replaces HoJ but no BL cast even for Holy. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/292389147967102976
why is no one concerned that all three of our CCs can be dispelled?
Dispellable CC should be the norm. "You can't counter me," isn't good for PvP. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/292724290070147072

I have no idea what you're doing with Blinding Light. You're nerfing it roughly the same way you did with Hungering Cold.

Shadow needs a PvP nerf. What would you suggest? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/292725044826742786

Agreed. PoH nerfed, and Blizzard obviously doesn't want PW:S blanketing, only other real option is Atonement.
I don't get the "We can't use PWS and we can't use PoH now so we're doomed." Use some PoH and use some PWS. Use the whole toolbox. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/292437038974779393
But why use PW:S now when mastery is only going to affect PW:S and divine aegis, which already relies on crit?

They got a lot. New set bonus. Glyphs baked in. Stuff undispellable. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/292388171793178625
New set bonus is worse than before. We lose out on PW:S giving ~28% reduction for 4seconds. And SS is BAD in PvP.
This is an example of competing feedback. Heard a lot of players saying Diamond Soul was meh but they missed Holy Spark. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/292437263315517440

Doesn't Disc tend to post better numbers than direct healing just because absorbs go before direct heals?
Yes. But that still means Disc is doing more for the group than the healers who are getting their heals sniped. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/291321933360939008

TCG Pets Giveaway Update
Many people are leaving comments that add no value to WoWDB, especially on the contest pet pages. These comments are being removed and repeatedly adding them will disqualify you from the contest. Lots of quest pages still lack comments if you are looking for somewhere to contribute to! The number of entries is lower so you have a better chance of winning, and multiple comments and screenshots will allow you to further increase your chances!

Rules

You can earn additional entries by leaving a useful comment on WoWDB http://www.wowdb.com/ pages. If you try to spam to get more entries, you will be disqualified from the contest.
