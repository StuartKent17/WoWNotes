Ragnaros: Too soon! (From Paragon (http://www.paragon.fi/news/ragnaros-25-man-heroic-dead))<br>
<br>
Or was it? No, not really. Not if you ask us.<br>
<br>
We&apos;ve NEVER put as much effort into a kill as we now did on downing Heroic Ragnaros. We had a few grueling low percentage wipes and we were already planning on continuing early tomorrow with a better set of gear. Our kill attempt was going to be our last pull of the night as the thunderstorms and disconnects were kicking in.<br>
<br>
Then everything clicked. All of our combined effort, practicing, theorycrafting and planning finally paid off. We had a near-perfect try and Ragnaros just melted away. A wave of relief washed over us. It was finally over. We wiped 500+ times on the boss, although I lost count at some point. Absolutely epic feeling after such an epic fight!<br>
<br>
We&apos;d really like to thank all of you guys for supporting us. We also would like to extend our gratitude to our sponsors who help us do what we do; a big thank you to SteelSeries, ASUS and especially our new partner DREAM! We&apos;d of course like to thank Blizzard and the developers as well. The hotfixes were lightning fast. :)<br>

We will be releasing a video of our kill later on -- most likely as soon as someone else kills Ragnaros on Heroic. Until then, keep following us!</div></div>
