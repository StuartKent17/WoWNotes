Live Stream<br>
You can use the stream on giga.de (http://www.giga.de/2/live/free/).<br>
If it doesn&apos;t work install the Octoshape plugin (http://www.octoshape.com/plugin/get.asp) and use http://127.0.0.1:6498/ms/asf/EPGIGA.giga350/Octoshape?MSWMExt=.asf (http://127.0.0.1:6498/ms/asf/EPGIGA.giga350/Octoshape?MSWMExt=.asf) in windows media player. (Yes, I know, it&apos;s a 127.0.0.1 URL but it works, Octoshape knows what to do with it)<br>
<br>

Utgarde Keep Preview<br>
WoWinsider.com (http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/08/03/first-impressions-wrath-of-the-lich-king-and-utgarde-keep/) posted a small preview of the Utgarde Keep (only playable in the press room). There isn&apos;t any major news (but it&apos;s still worth the reading) but there is a very interesting information here.<br>
&quot;We could not use our flying mounts in Northrend. But Blizzard has said they will be able to be used there, they just weren&apos;t in the build we played (and it made finding that darn keep even harder).&quot;<br>
