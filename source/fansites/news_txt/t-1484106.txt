Ok, core if issue inc. Value of crit PvP != Value of crit PvE. Value of other stats PvP = Val other stat PvE. Given that, how can you possible make balanced with other values in PVE and PvP at the same time? If you can't, crit classes will be weak in PvP. If you buff them, they'll be strong in PvE.
It's worth remembering that at 200%, crit is *more* valuable in PvP, than PvE. Celestalon 
Will elemental shamans still get their buffed crit modifier in PvP?
It's a 25% reduction to crit damage. So they still get extra crit damage, but then reduced by 25%. holinka 
So 200% base +50% extra -25% = 187.5% crit for ele shamans in PvP?
Yes holinka

'Afternoon. WoD Tank info seems hard to come by. 3 ?s, if you are willing: Value of Multistrike for tanksjust dps or more?
Multistrike will have defensive value. Celestalon 
Is that just self-heals, or a chance for damage reduction to multistrike? I.e., get another 30% of your armor?
Just like there are passives that give defensive value to crit, there will be passives that give defensive value to Multistrike. Celestalon 

.Meaning 30% Multistrike = one 30% roll in PvP max 130% damage, two 15% rolls in PvE max 160% damage, same avg dmg?
Yes. Celestalon 

Also, the same argument can be made for haste because haste bonus to CC casts. Separate value there too? 
Multistrike will also have a PvP modifier. One extra roll instead of two. holinka 
Everyone will just avoid crit and multistrike like the plague, don't see how it's a good idea
Multistrike's combines the two rolls into one. Same average chance. Multistrike will definitely *not* be avoided. Celestalon 
are you sure that multistrike isn't causing a similar problem that you just fixed with 150% crits? Peaky dmg.
Multistrike caps out at 130%, and is much *much* more common, such that it will be the common occurrence, not a rare burst. Celestalon 

PvE
Pugging is a prob. a niche audience too though, saying that just because personal is an option, organizers might not take it
I'd expect PUG organizers using personal loot will see more takers. It's nice to not worry whether you can trust the master loot WatcherDev 

any plans for an increase of tank dmg taken to make room for dedicated tank healers again?
If we hit tanks any harder today, we'd just one-shot them. Vengeance and smart heals are the major culprits. Agree with the goal. WatcherDev 
Just tank healing or Single-Target healing in general? I think targeted healing is more interesting than aoe/smart
Absolutely. Making decisions is more interesting than pushing a button and having them made for you. WatcherDev 

how are heroic lockouts handled? had a shammy, not able to join H.Galakras because he was locked to 3/4 /w H.Norushen down.
Heroic lockouts assign a single fixed raid ID for the week, and you can't enter any other Heroic ID for that zone once locked. WatcherDev 

PvP
If silences are gone from interrupt, what happens to silencing shot? Gone too?
Replaced with Counter Shot holinka 

Is there a reason a lot of classes dodge/parry monks in arenas? 6% over pvp expertise cap, and I don't get issue on other toons 
Agility classes gain dodge & strength classes gain parry. Attack them from behind to avoid getting dodged/parried. holinka 

Will Movement speed stack in RBG disapear totally anytime soo ? 
We're reimplementing this speed system in Warlords to avoid alot of these stacking bugs slipping through. holinka 

Warlords of Draenor
There isn't a word in the English language that would adequately convey how much I want new Garrison info. ETA on info dump?
