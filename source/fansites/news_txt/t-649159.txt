Argent Tournament Mounts
The Argent Tournament mounts are being updated with this patch. Mounts already purchased at the Argent Tournament will be replaced with the updated mounts when this patch goes live. 

For those looking to get their hands on even more sweet rides, ten mounts using the original tournament look will be available for purchase from Argent Tournament vendors for 5 Champion's Seals and 500 gold faction discounts apply. To purchase these original mounts at the Argent Tournament, players must be either members of, or exalted with, the corresponding faction.

Argent Hippogryph Cost Lowered
In order to better balance the cost of new rewards that we would like to add to the Argent Tournament, we will be changing the cost of the Argent Hippogryph flying mount in the next minor patch. These mounts will be reduced in cost from 250 Champion’s Seals to 150 Champion’s Seals. Further details regarding additional new rewards will be provided in the future.

A display issue may occur with this change, causing the Argent Hippogryph to continue to display a cost of 250 Champion’s Seals. This display issue will be resolved in a future patch. 

Wintergrasp Quests now Weekly
Wintergrasp daily quests are now weekly, most of the rewards have been increased to reflect these changes.
In an effort to better balance the amount of players that are in Wintergrasp at any given time, we are changing the daily quests in Wintergrasp to a weekly format. This has led to an increase in the honor reward given by these quests as well as additional Stone Keeper's Shards. These quests will reset every Tuesday morning at 3:00 AM.

There are two known issues that may occur once these changes are pushed to live realms:

The quest mark will now show as gold, even though the quests are repeatable.
After the quests reset, players near the NPC quest givers may need to move out of line of sight in order for the quests to properly appear.

According to the latest PTR build, the honor gains in Wintergrasp have been slightly nerfed. 
Lake Wintergrasp
Wintergrasp Victory http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=56902 now rewards 3000 Honor. Down from 5000 Honor
Wintergrasp Defeat http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=58494 now rewards 1250 Honor. Down from 3000 Honor
Tower Damaged http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=59135 now grants up to 750 Honor. Down from 1250 Honor
Tower Destroyed http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=59136 now grants up to 750 Honor. Down from 1250 Honor
Damaged Building Reward http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=59201 now grants up to 750 Honor. Down from 1250 Honor
Intact Building Defender http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=59203 now grants up to 1500 Honor. Down from 2500 Honor Note: Currently shown as 150 Honor but most likely a typo


Ulduar Item Changes
Weapons from the hard mode version of Ulduar 10-Man have been upgraded and are now slightly more powerful. These changes should already be in game and patch 3.1.2 will only reflect them in the item tooltips, see the comparison below.
In order to better reward players for completing hard mode encounters in 10-player Ulduar, we will be updating weapon rewards from these hard mode encounters to an item level of 232 in the next minor patch. Players already with these items should see an increase in the power of these items to better reflect the new item level. 
A few more items were also changed for various reasons. Stats additions or redistribution, weapon speed changed, and texture fixed for 
<font color="#A335EE">Conqueror's Darkruned Legguards</font> /i/news/2009/may/ptr_9901_40.jpg

Please also note that due to the low amount of players on test realms, I couldn't get the stats of all the items here but most of them should be listed below.

Ventrilo Servers - MLG Voice
A few weeks ago, Major League Gaming the parent company of MMO-Champion launched a new ventrilo hosting service called MLG Voice http://www.mlgvoice.com/.

First I would like to thanks all the people who signed up and who now use our services, your support to this site is much appreciated and will hopefully help improving it in the long run. 

I would also like to point out that the servers listed on the right of MLG Voice http://www.mlgvoice.com/ are test servers that anyone can use to check the quality of the service before ordering. All you need is Ventrilo installed on your computer and clicking the connect link should work just fine if you have a decent browser, but I'm sure you do
