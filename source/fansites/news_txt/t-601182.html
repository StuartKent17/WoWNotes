Since it&apos;s a new day without much news, a few words about what&apos;s coming.<br>
This week (it will probably start tomorrow), most of the raiding guides will be updated (all of them, except Karazhan) with more informations, and a nice extra feature. These changes will be considered as &quot;beta&quot; and your help in improving the new content will be greatly appreciated in the next days. Don&apos;t hesitate to use the contact link on the left for any contribution or question, i&apos;ll try to change it to a web mail form to make it easier to reports problems.<br>
<br>
Concerning Karazhan guides, I don&apos;t want to waste too much time on them, and don&apos;t want to modify them too much since they&apos;re not mine (thanks again to Soul Society (http://nordrassor.freehostia.com/phpBB/index.php)). Nevertheless, if you want to work on new Karazhan guides, I&apos;m open to all offers. <br>
<br>
*cough* People helping a lot in the next few days may get something nice at the end. (But let&apos;s not turn this into a contest ... yet.)</div></div>
