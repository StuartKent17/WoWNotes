Sunday, no news, you can leave this site. No, actually, I updated a few things.<br>
The Hall of Fame (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=251) was updated with better screenshots, basically it just means that I removed most of the old annoying watermarks on the older kills.<br>
I realized that some pages (like the Consumables list (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=40)) still had old items, I updated most of them a few weeks ago but some still had old version stats. Everything should be updated now. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It&apos;s not like anyone use these pages, but they still deserved an update. <br>

Skin changes in 2.2<br>
The [item=32500] skin was changed in the 2.2 patch, it looks a lot better now. (Thanks to shujenka)<br>

Tempest Keep / Serpentshrine Cavern movie<br>
Considering how popular Curse&apos;s Black Temple video was, it&apos;s time for another video to keep you busy on sunday. Numen (http://www.numen-guild.com/) released a very nicely edited movie of Serpentshrine Cavern and Tempest Keep. You can get tons of details about the movie in this post (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=612473755&amp;sid=1) and you can watch it below if you&apos;ve got the DiVX plugin from stage6. (If you don&apos;t, download it, or try this link (http://stage6.divx.com/user/Qvist/video/1586459/Vials-of-Eternity) but you&apos;ll need it anyway)</div></div>
