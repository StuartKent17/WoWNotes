<br>
We were able to sit down with one of the competing teams, Method: Triforce (https://www.method.gg/wow-eu-arena-regional-champions-method-triforce), for a quick interview at the World Championships. Here is a recap:<br>
<br>
Q: What kind of effort and strategy do you do for these competitions in advance?<br>
A: We play every day. It goes from 2 to 3, sometimes 8 hours depending on the day. Every day we try to get quality practice, but if the day just doesn&#x2019;t feel right or is bad for certain reasons we play less.<br>
<br>
Q: Do you do anything in WoW outside of arena?<br>
A: If you want to do arena you need artifact power and so we do world quests. It&#x2019;s not our favorite activity, but it&#x2019;s a habit. <br>
<br>
Q: In your spare time, do you do anything outside of video games entirely?<br>
A: It depends. The past months we haven&#x2019;t really had time for anything else. Before arenas we didn&#x2019;t practice as much, but then we got into arenas which was a boost in motivation to play. We took much of the summer off. After this we will see.<br>
<br>
Q: Do you have any interest in the Mythic Dungeon Invitational?<br>
A: We were joking about adding it to our days but we didn&#x2019;t want to do it over PVP.<br>
<br>
Q: What about battlegrounds?<br>
A: We play rated battlegrounds sometimes, but not battlegrounds.<br>
<br>
Q: What do you expect for the future of arenas?<br>
A: The game right now is mostly balanced. If you play well you usually win. Having more complex classes could bring more life into arenas. How well you pressed your buttons and positioning played a much bigger role in damage output and performance in the past.<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
I know you have NDA and all, but can you tell us what obviously fake leak is your favorite?<br>
Anything involving Tel&apos;abim (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/924066991958142976))<br>
I thought we agreed not to give any hints, Jeremy? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/924074064418705408))<br>
<br>
Endless Halls<br>
So are the &quot;exits&quot; always in blocks of 4 rooms? Or are they more random than this?<br>
It&apos;s always an 8x8 grid with those edge connections. The layout of walls within them vary. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/923648628861710336))<br>
<br>
So was this post an elaborate troll, or is that still the optimal way to solve it even if you know how it really works?<br>
Mapping it is indeed the most *reliable* way to solve it (naturally you could just get lucky moving randomly, but that&apos;s not reliable). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/923752428129812480))<br>
Oh, you mean because my map isn&apos;t 8x8? Yeah, it&apos;s hard to tell where the edges are until you&apos;ve mapped it all out, so you naturally go over. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/923752643054379009))<br>
Unless the offset when you wrap around is also randomised?<br>
Nope. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/923759990375976960))<br>
<br>
Wow, now i know why running straight didn&apos;t work. Btw how do you identify the teleportation trap room?<br>
Obvious case will be if you ever enter a room that has rubble where you came from. Otherwise, if you backtrack and see a diff room. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/923844412756684804))<br>
<br>
Which is why I&apos;m asking who I presume is the designer<br>
Indeed, randomly chosen each time you hit the trap. Find the Teleportstion Trap, and avoid it from then on! (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/923678058850029568))<br>
<br>
now is this maze the same for everyone or just you personally?<br>
Per the blog, &quot;the Endless Halls is randomized based on your player ID, as well as the day of the week&quot;. That diagram is just an example. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/923608155073921024))<br>
Are the dimensions similar or just the same concept?<br>
Always 8x8. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/923614260579540992))<br>
