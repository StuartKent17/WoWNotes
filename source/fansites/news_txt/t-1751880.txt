Darkmoon Faire Races
This month brings some more races to the Darkmoon Faire, in addition to the other Patch 6.1 changes  The first race uses the same course as last month, allowing you to earn Rocketeer: Gold  and the Everlasting Darkmoon Firework  fairly easily.

The other two races use a new course that is more challenging. These reward Big Rocketeer: Gold  Race MiniZep Controller  and Big Race Roadhog  Checkered Flag  Keep in mind that the Checkered Flag  only has 50 charges and that is the more difficult of the two achievements to complete. This can be done solo  if RNG lines up just right or with the help of a friend 

The new course has new powerups as well. Everything other than the speed boots and coins rotates through the buffs, so they are constantly changing. There are two new buffs, one being a rocket that shoots you up in the air and the other being a small blue portal that rushes you ahead like Disengage. You can collect coins to power your final ability. There is also a new obstacle on this course, mini-zeppelins. These will shoot you and slow you down if you get too close to them.

any plans to make the challenge mode gear from MoP account wide?
No plans at this time. WarcraftDevs 

hi guys, love your game. wondering why there is no heirloom mount that works for new Pandaren characters, is that intended?
This is a side-effect of the chauffeured mount being affiliated w/ Alliance or Horde. Itâ€™ll work once you choose a faction. WarcraftDevs 

with Heirlooms now going up to lvl 100, can we have them drop from Garrosh again? Main draw of those was look/90-100 scaling.
Those were a reward for doing the content when it was relevant, and there are no plans to bring them back at this time. WarcraftDevs 

Could the Polished Helm of Valor possibly get a change? Both it and the Might have Haste, which the Valor set is Crit-based.
Thank you for the feedback. This and other Heirloom stat changes are being addressed in an upcoming patch. WarcraftDevs 

Can the Follower Trait and Follower Ability Retraining items stack please? 
Items that don't have a high stack amount are our gentle way of encouraging their frequent use. WarcraftDevs
