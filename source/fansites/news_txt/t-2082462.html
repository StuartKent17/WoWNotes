Arcane Mage Hidden Artifact Appearance<br>
The Order of the Shepherd discord (https://discord.gg/dhuxpqW) found The Woolomancer&apos;s Charge (http://www.wowdb.com/items/139558-the-woolomancers-charge) that unlocks a sheep appearance for the Arcane Mage artifact. <br>

<br>
There are different mobs in the Broken Isle zones you need to do a one time polymorph on:<br>
<br>
Zone Targets Polymorphed: Azsuna (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43787-zone-targets-polymorphed-azsuna) - Cliffwing Hippogryph (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/89386-cliffwing-hippogryph)<br>
Zone Targets Polymorphed: Highmountain (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43788-zone-targets-polymorphed-highmountain) - Highpeak Goat (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/99636-highpeak-goat)<br>
Zone Targets Polymorphed: Stormheim (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43789-zone-targets-polymorphed-stormheim) - Plains Runehorn Calf (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/107808-plains-runehorn-calf)<br>
Zone Targets Polymorphed: Suramar (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43791-zone-targets-polymorphed-suramar) - Heartwood Doe (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/110043-heartwood-doe)<br>
Zone Targets Polymorphed: Val&apos;sharah (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43790-zone-targets-polymorphed-valsharah) - Wild Dreamrunner (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/109819-wild-dreamrunner)<br>
<br>
Reach Artifact Knowledge level 6.<br>
Every day you have a chance to unlock the next part of the chain via the Sheep Summon Daily Roll (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43828-sheep-summon-daily-roll) by entering your Order Hall<br>
When the roll is successful, a Volatile Sheep (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111107-volatile-sheep) will appear next to you in the Order Hall. Click it until it explodes.<br>
Head to Runewood in Stormheim and find the Extremely Volatile Stormheim Sheep (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111691-extremely-volatile-stormheim-sheep). Click it until it explodes.<br>
Head to the Tower of Azora in Elwynn Forest and meet Cote &quot;Shepherd&quot; Metcalf (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111704-cote-shepherd-metcalf). <br>
Help him defeat the Enraged Elwynn Sheep (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111745-enraged-elwynn-sheep), witness another part of the event, and then kill him.<br>
Loot the The Woolomancer&apos;s Charge (http://www.wowdb.com/items/139558-the-woolomancers-charge)!<br>
Occasionally when polymorphing things, the staff will change from the regular model to the model below and scream. <br>

Rated PvP Gearing Changes<br>
As we&#x2019;d previously announced, our intention with gear rewarded from rated PvP in Patch 7.0.3 is for the chance to receive a Warforged/Titanforged piece of gear to increase as your rating increases. We&#x2019;ve recently discovered a bug that is causing that system not to function. Currently, rated PvP is always rewarding item level 840 gear, regardless of rating. That is not our intent.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re currently working on a fix for this issue, and once it&#x2019;s ready, we&#x2019;ll apply it during weekly restarts. We want to correct it as quickly as possible, but don&#x2019;t want to inadvertently punish players who have already collected their weekly bonus chests. We&#x2019;re also implementing more rigorous testing procedures for future PvP seasons to ensure that this doesn&#x2019;t happen again.<br>
<br>
Realistically, we should have caught this bug during testing, but didn&#x2019;t. That&#x2019;s completely our fault, and we apologize. That said, we&#x2019;re not really happy with the current model for PvP gearing anyway (even ignoring this issue), and we&#x2019;re planning to make a couple of key changes for Patch 7.1.<br>
<br>
For starters, instead of having rating increase the chance for a piece to roll Warforged or Titanforged, it will increase the minimum item level that a piece can be. So, as your rating increases, you will be guaranteed to earn higher item level gear, regardless of whether it Warforges or not. We&#x2019;re also going to clearly tell you what the minimum item level you can receive is, to remove the guesswork.<br>
<br>
Secondly, instead of basing gear off of your current rating, it will be based on the highest rating you earned in the previous week. This means you&#x2019;ll always be rewarded for your best performance of the week, no matter when exactly that was.<br>
<br>
Again, we apologize that we didn&#x2019;t recognize and correct the issue with the current gearing system sooner, but are hopeful that the changes in Patch 7.1 will result in a better overall experience for everyone.<br>

<br>
Developers&#x2019; Notes: Currently, rated PvP is always rewarding item level 840 gear, regardless of rating. That is not our intent. We want to correct this as quickly as possible, but don&#x2019;t want to inadvertently punish players who have already collected their weekly bonus chests. This fix will be implemented with the next weekly realm maintenance (A.M. PDT on Tuesday, October 4 for North American realms).<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FEEDBACK: Karazhan!<br>
The new Karazhan dungeon is now open for testing on the PTR! It will remain open over the weekend. This is a Mythic-only dungeon, so form a group of 5 players and venture to Deadwind Pass. The entrance to the new dungeon is on the side of the tower, accessed via an elevated bridge (the front door will still take you into the Burning Crusade raid). Player item level will be normalized inside the dungeon for testing purposes. <br>
<br>
Please use this thread for your feedback; thanks for testing!<br>

Warlord&apos;s Deathwheel: Horde Availability<br>
I&apos;m still confused as to how the Horde &quot;won&quot;, when the bike is no longer available, whereas the Alliance one is. What&apos;s the problem with making the Horde one avaliable again for 100k?<br>
There are a few unfortunate legal obligations that have halted a release of the Horde&apos;s Deathwheel, from what I understand. Something about &lt;insert legal jargon about prizing&gt;.<br>
<br>
Again, an unfortunate circumstance, but I&apos;m not sure that anything can be done.<br>
<br>
I&apos;ll bring this up again next week and see if anything has changed since I last asked about this a few months back.

Yet they will drop everything to tell a death knight that warriors will be nerfed. Maybe think a little before you post.<br>
To be fair, Ignore Pain was a bit* ridiculous before the nerf.<br>
<br>
*See: absolutely, incredibly, extraordinarily<br>
<br>
Yes, however it is all we have. We can hardly use shield block because we need to get to that IP. If IP was the problem tune that, not our rage.<br>
<br>
Edit: If you&apos;re still reading please have someone put a patchnote out for the prot warrior hidden appearance hotfix. People have been logging in and out for hours with no indication it doesn&apos;t work.<br>
Indeed!<br>
<br>
The flip of that: we are discussing a potential hotfix to increase rage generation from Shield Slam and reduce Ignore Pain&apos;s maximum absorption, so hopefully that will help with any &apos;clunky&apos; feeling that Warriors have been noting.

Throw Glaive dmg was nerfed by 30% by accident even tho you guys struck it from the patch notes.(tooltip is right, dmg isnt)<br>
This is in line with expected behavior. Physical damage is reduced by Armor. It will deal ~30% less than the tooltip vs a Training Dummy.(WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/780842338457231360))<br>
