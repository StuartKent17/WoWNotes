Artcraft Updates
We might get a followup to the old Cosmetic Class Accessories artcraft  at some point in the future. They were originally described as ways to customize your character, rewarded through many different gameplay activities. Keep in mind that a somewhat similar system is coming with spec specific Artifact Weapons with multiple skins.


  


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
No reason to exchange words, because we will most likely never meet ingame again. Thoughts?
The Finders were supposed to be for when your friends weren't available, not as a way to experience an MMO solo. OccupyGStreet 
But the awesome convenience of quick matchmaking means why wait for friends? League has the same problem. OccupyGStreet 

I think the game design philosophy changed to: Leveling = solo, PvP/Endgame = groups.
I remember in vanilla having to ask friends to help for the Plagueland cauldron quests and a few others. OccupyGStreet 
But I think it's fair that a lot of people just abandoned the group quests even when they capped off a story. OccupyGStreet
