We have enabled free character moves for select realms to offer you a way to move your characters from the most high-population realms that have extended queues. In this region, player-characters at any level can now move:<br>
<br>
From -&gt; To<br>
<br>
Arugal -&gt; Felstriker<br>
Faerlina -&gt; Heartseeker (new realm)<br>
Stalagg -&gt; Heartseeker (new realm)<br>
Herod -&gt; Earthfury (new realm)<br>
Skeram -&gt; Earthfury (new realm)<br>
Incendius -&gt; Netherwind<br>
Thalnos -&gt; Netherwind<br>
Fairbanks -&gt; Arcanite Reaper (new realm)<br>
Whitemane -&gt; Arcanite Reaper (new realm)<br>
Bigglesworth -&gt; Anathema<br>
Pagle -&gt; Windseeker<br>
Grobbulus -&gt; Deviate Delight<br>
<br>
<br>
On the realms above, free character moves can be initialized from either the character select screen or the queue screen.<br>
<br>
We expect these free character moves to remain open for the realms above through this coming weekend. Please note that restrictions apply:<br>
<br>
<br>
A character cannot move if the character:<br>
<br>
is a guild leader.<br>
has active auction listings or bids.<br>
has mail.<br>
<br>
You may be required to change your character&#x2019;s name once you&#x2019;ve reached the destination realm.<br>
You cannot move a character to a PvP realm where you already have a character belonging to the opposing faction.<br>
This is a one-way, irreversible move. Blizzard Customer Support cannot monitor or modify a free character move.<br>
<br>
<br>
During periods of high usage, free character moves may take up to several hours to complete. This service may be closed at any time, without warning, should a destination realm become full. We strongly encourage players who wish to use this service, especially in coordinated groups, to do so as soon as possible.<br>

Thank you!</div></div>
