If the kill was indeed made by using an exploit we will probably hear about it from Blizzard soon, just wait a few more days and try to be nice on forums. <br>

Three more bosses are shared by both factions and are NPCs you can already meet on the Argent Tournament Grounds. <br>

We don&apos;t really know a lot more about these fights as they are not yet available on PTRs, but it looks like the last 3 will be fun according to the achievements (http://db.mmo-champion.com/achievements/14921?id__gte=2500#) ...<br>

Defeast the Black Knight in 10 minutes while wearing all blue items, before 3 Volcanos erupt, while everyone in the group has at least 1 stack of Spurting Blood and there are no shamans or paladins in the party but before you spend at least 1000 gold in repairs wiping to the Black Knight&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>

The Argent Confessor (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3802/argent-confessor/) achievement for the fight against Argent Confessor Paletress (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/34928/argent-confessor-paletress/) is probably the most interesting one. According to some datamining I did on the creatures (http://db.mmo-champion.com/search/creature/memory%20of/) it seems that this encounter will let you experience previous fights with bosses from past dungeons/expansions. <br>

Even if the instance seems to be fairly small, you will find 8 different bosses here according to the Call of the Grand Crusade (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3812/call-of-the-grand-crusade-25-player/) achievement. Please note that Fjola Lightbane and Eydis Darkbane are probably part of the same encounter. (See Double Time (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3815/double-time-25-player/))<br>

The last boss is currently named &quot;Final Boss&quot; in the achievement but this isn&apos;t going to stop us right? Achievements usually point to the ID of the creature you&apos;re supposed to kill and this final boss points to the ID of ....<br>
<br>
Anub&apos;arak (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/34660/anub-arak/)! <br>
Azjol-Nerub was merely a setback! The former nerubian king is back and hopefully players will be able to face him in a much more epic fight than what they experienced in the early 5-man instance. Even if he doesn&apos;t seem to have any model in the game files for the moment we can fairly assume that he will use the new Frost Cryptlord model added in 3.2.<br>

SK Gaming wins the Regionals of the Arena Tournament<br>

Regional Finals Coverage - Sunday (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/9520949812-regional-finals-coverage--sunday.html)<br>
In the very last World of Warcraft match of the day, we find SK gaming set to face off against TSG for the title of US Regional Champions and a hefty slump of money. Without much fuss we find the first round underway in the Ring of Valor. TSG open the match by Death Gripping Realz into the thick of things but are unable to capitalise on the play as Realz gets some assitance from Pooks and escapes using Pain Suppression to stay alive. From there SK turn the tide of the battle in an instant as they force Zilea to bubble only to have it Mass Dispelled. While Zilea catches up on the healing, SK swaps target to Valrath and drop him in the matter of a full duration Kidney shot. SK gaming takes the first round of the Grand Finals.<br>
<br>
Minutes later the second match starts as we watch Veex charging into Pookz on the Nagrand Arena. Enforcer gets caught in a fear by Veex but trinkets it and gets straight onto Zilea. On SK Gaming&apos;s end, Realz is forced to use Pain suppression on Pookz after he already had used his IceBlock. TSG, not willing to let the pressure drop, stick to their target and manage to drop him fast as there is no IceBlock of Pain Suppression to save him from the hard hitting melee. TSG takes the round and equalises the score to 1-1.<br>
<br>
The third round is pretty much all one way as SK Gamign open on Zilea, throwing both Imp CounterSpells and Kidneyshots his way. Zilea in return trinkets the kidney shot in order to get away. The match goes on for a few as SK keep the pressure up and finally are able to drop Zilea with a combination of Mass Dispel on the bubble followed by a second Imp CS. At this point, Zilea is dangerously low and it is not a hard task for Enforcer to finish him off. SK takes the lead: 2-1.<br>
<br>
In the fourth round of the Grand Finals, we can see TSG charging into Enforcer in hopes to keep his stuns off their paladin. Despite Zilea using his bubble to heal himself to full, as soon as he pops back out into the match SK swaps target once again to him and pretty much blows him up in a matter of moments. SK Gaming wins the match 3-1, securing the title of US Regional Champions and 5000 dollers each.<br>
<br>
With that set of power plays, SK Gaming have proved their ability to the world by claiming the title of US Regional Champions. We look forward to seeing them defend their honor in the WorldWide Grand Finals at Blizzcon 2009.<br>
<br>
Congratulations to them, and thanks to everyone who came to the venue to make the event as memorable as it has been.<br>
<br>
With that; Over and Out from the event venue here in Cologne, Germany. <br>
