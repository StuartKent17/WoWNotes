Blizzard's Official Drustvar Zone Preview
Blizzard posted a preview and lore summary for Drustvar today!
In the land of Drustvar, the stalwart protectors of House Waycrest hold fast along the western border, but recently all contact with them has been lost. Travel beyond the frontier to learn of their fate and battle the resurgence of an ancient and terrifying enemy.

Drustvar is a region known for the tenacity of the soldiers who protect it. Long after the defeat of the mysterious Drust who once dwelled there, the descendants of Arom Waycrest and his people continue to eke out a living in this unyielding land. They are known throughout Kul Tiras as being a hearty, stoic, and deeply superstitious people, and would make keen allies in the fight against the Horde—but now it’s up to you to discover why they’ve gone silent.

Welcome to Drustvar.

When first arriving in Drustvar, you’ll be greeted by a dark and foreboding shoreline on the eastern border. Drustvar is a rugged land plagued by superstition, and signs of witchcraft are everywhere. The pathways through Glenbrook to Fallhaven are fraught with danger, so you’ll need to stay on your guard. Dark rumors swirl as to what may have befallen the Waycrest family—and if the Alliance has any hope of convincing the Kul Tirans to join them, you’ll need to untangle the mysteries that lay ahead.

Verdigris roofs and awnings adorn buildings of brick and wood, their amber window panes alight from within. The sea’s intrinsic role in Kul Tiran culture is reflected in the architecture, and anchors and other symbols of the sea decorate doorways and awnings.

A stygian pallor looms over the town of Fallhaven, reeking of mystical meddling. A large and ominous construct stands as sentinel in the center of town, and the townsfolk are . . . unresponsive. You’ll need to work diligently to break the curse on the town before you can make any progress toward getting to the heart of the troubles in Drustvar.

Cobblestone paths wind through the region and in and out of the various villages and towns. History and culture are deeply woven into the fabric of Kul Tiras, but so too are the workings of dark witches. Cursed and hopelessly twisted townsfolk and creatures work in servitude to these mystics’ machinations, set to a task you’ll need to decipher and put an end to—if you have the stomach for it.

Visitors to this region will need to rely on their wits, solve a few not-so-small issues the citizenry faces, and hopefully make some inroads with the people along the way.

Dark rituals are afoot in these lands. Will you be able to unravel their bindings?

There are more mysteries to unravel, and an ancient enemy is stirring in the land, causing a tremendous slew of trouble.

TAKE THE HIGHROAD

Traveling westward will lead to a large chain of rugged snow-touched mountains running from the northern border of the region to the southern Iceveil Glacier, nearly bisecting the region in two. Along Highroad Pass, you’ll come across various wildlife and creatures, including Chillwind Yetis who find the cold of the mountains to their liking and food sources plentiful.

The road is fraught with danger, but you’ll eventually arrive in the town of Arom’s Stand, which overlooks a valley to the west. A tribute to Arom Waycrest stands vigil even as the people here struggle against the darkness that has swept over the land.

Did you Know? Arom Waycrest was the first Lord of Drustvar, who helped his people overcome great opposition from a powerful enemy: the Drust.
On the southwestern coast you’ll cross into the Crimson Forest. Various shades of red assail your eyes and bear witness to the veracity of the name. The town of Falconhurst sits on the coast, and as in your previous travels through the region, you’ll find this settlement is under siege by dark forces.

Things to Try: Need a small break from saving the people of Drustvar? Visit the Falconhurst inn and join the children as they are regaled by stories and songs of heroic deeds and adventure.

TAINTED RULE

North of the Crimson Forest, the Ashenwood Grove bears witness to creatures adorned with fungi and strange creatures known as Fungarians patrolling the pathways. Farms dot the area and mines can be found dug into the mountainsides, but what should be bustling enterprises have ground to a halt as the witches’ special brand of pestilent creatures wreak havoc.

Each clue found and mystery solved only puts forth more questions as to what could be ultimately manipulating events in Drustvar. Perhaps you’ll find the source of the troubles within Waycrest Manor*—ancestral home of the Waycrest family who watches over Drustvar.

*Waycrest Manor is a 5-player dungeon in Drustvar.

A vast coastline surrounds Drustvar to the east, south, and west, where those brave enough can fish, boat, swim, and hunt for treasure. Inland, the mountains and forests provide a chance to hunt a variety of . . . interesting . . . creatures. To the north, the rolling hills and mountains of Stormsong Valley await, while eastward lies Tiragarde Sound—and even more opportunities to earn your way into the good graces of the Kul Tirans.

The 50% Rule
I have put a lot of thought into this an hours crafting this excellent new rule that I very much hope Blizzard will implement if not now then in the next expansion.

It is the 50% rule. Here it is: After one month of release, any and all content shall be completed by at least 50% of the players. In the event this is not the case, the content in question will be re-tuned so that 50% of the player base has achieved success in said content.

...
Just because content is not able to be completed does not mean it is necessarily broke or needs adjustment. Sure you can have things that function incorrectly and we usually respond to that pretty quickly when its current content and get it fixed.

If we haven't adjusted something like say the Mage Tower by now, that means we think its working fine, which for additional context we do if the previous wasn't clear enough. It's okay to have hard content that you cannot complete. To me the game feels bigger if there are things I've been unable to do yet. If everything was easy and you could get any reward without any sort of effort then there would be almost no desire to play. It's a balancing act of accessible versus hard content but it doesn't mean you cannot still have hard content. 

Just because I can't do it doesn't mean it should be adjusted lower, that means I can do better to accomplish that goal. Sure it took me 140+ tries on my first mage tower appearance, but it was fun. Every death is a learning opportunity to figure out what not to do. It's intended for you to die and struggle but its designed so that it can be beat Spoiler: All PvE content is designed so that you can beat it. With the increase in gearing, the Mage Towers are no longer as challenging as they were but that doesn't mean you get a free pass for a reward. You still have to pay attention to timings and learn how to do them. Mage Tower's are supposed to be difficult and the reward is considered a badge of skill with that spec, just like the Challenge Modes, and just like the original Proving Grounds. 

Being bad is the first step to gittin gud, before anyone was gud, they were bad. Not everyone is as equally skilled at the start but everyone can learn to git gud. 

Side Note: Your posts are irritating to read because of your random bolding of words. Let's cut that out or we'll start editing them in the future.

The OP has endured the flame war, and was most gracious when this blue ordered him too goose step into submission with threats of Orwellian censoring.

Everyone has an opinion about this game, the OPs is just an opinion, that is all. For a representative of Blizzard to threaten a paying customer with verbal throttling goes beyond the scope of reasonable conduct.

I am neither for or against the OPs suggestion. I could care less. What I do care about is a Blizzard employee marching into this forum under the pretense of monitoring and instead berates and abuses whatever small power base they give them.
Little hyperbolic don't you think? I asked Rastlin to please stop. They said sure. The discussion about it ended. Rastlin is totally fine to voice their opinion about content and what they feel should change about it, and there is nothing wrong about that. I suggested it because it is irritating to read because I see it in every post they make. You don't have to excessively bold, caps lock, asterisk, italicize, or underline to get your point across. If you can't then your point probably wasn't coming across well in the first place and you should start there. Rastlin doesn't need to do either, their point is coming across just fine. I may not agree with what they say but they're one of the better posters in that they make it clear what they're asking for.
