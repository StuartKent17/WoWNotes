Warlords of Draenor - Developer Interviews<br>
MamyTwink (http://www.mamytwink.com/actualite/interview-gamescom-2014-tom-chilton-repond-a-nos-questions) had the opportunity to talk to Tom Chilton at Gamescom and we have summarized the more important parts of the interview below. <br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;object width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;70&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;//www.youtube.com/v/s_pbPWQDZ6w?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/v/s_pbPWQDZ6w?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;70&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br>
<br>
Warlords Content<br>
<br>
There is a level 100 content area in every zone. It is similar to Timeless Isle, but also includes &quot;chapter quests&quot; that provide an ongoing story over several weeks. <br>
Reputations in Warlords won&apos;t reward as many epic items as before, but you can still earn reputation with various factions for some rewards. It won&apos;t be anything like the Mists of Pandaria reputation grinds. <br>
The Iron Horde will be the main enemy throughout the expansion, but they change somewhat throughout the expansion. <br>
There will be an increased Legion presence by the end of the expansion. <br>
<br>
<br>
Future Plans<br>
<br>
Tanaan Jungle will be in a content patch. It contains the Grommash Hellscream raid, as well as some outdoor world content. <br>
At some point the team would like to add new character customization options, but right now they are working on making the new models similar to the old ones as closely as possible.<br>
Cosmetic class items are still on track, but won&apos;t be released with Warlords launch. They will most likely be released a few at a time throughout the expansion and beyond.<br>
<br>
<br>
Timelines<br>
<br>
The alternative timeline is mostly being used to allow players to experience a setting they wouldn&apos;t normally be able to see in WoW. <br>
At some point in the future in another expansion they could explore the Ogre continent from Draenor. <br>
We won&apos;t see an alternative timeline version of Azeroth.<br>

Warlords of Draenor - Drake Collector Achievement<br>
Jonathan LeCraft shared (https://twitter.com/TheCrafticus/status/501930988692180994) another upcoming achievement recently, along with the reward: the Emerald Drake. He also noted that soloing Deathwing for the Blazing Drake (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/77067-reins-of-the-blazing-drake) will be possible. Several of these mounts are fairly rare drops, with some as low as a 1% drop rate.<br>

Upcoming Beta Build<br>
Greetings All!<br>
<br>
The Beta realms will be coming down for maintenance tomorrow morning (Thursday, 8/21) in order to deploy a new build. I&apos;ll be updating this thread with information and time estimates as I receive them. We hope to finish realm maintenance on all realms before our &quot;Play with the Blues&quot; event at 3:00 pm PDT (except for the Level 100 PvE Beta Realm which will stay down a bit longer),<br>
<br>
Starting this thread pretty early to give you folks a heads up<br>
<br>
I&apos;ll be leaving this thread open for general discussion as long as people remain civil and follow forum rules.<br>
<br>
<br>
Upcoming Tech Blog<br>
Players with beta access may have noticed that the old MSAA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisample_anti-aliasing) option is now gone. In its place is FXAA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_approximate_anti-aliasing) and CMAA (https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/conservative-morphological-anti-aliasing-cmaa-update) options. These offer reduced jaggniess at less of a performance cost than MSAA, but tend to result in somewhat blurrier images. From the tweets so far, it seems like this may have been a necessary change<br>

Play With the Blues - Thursday Aug 21<br>
It&#x2019;s time to play with Blues on the Beta realms! Help us put the Premade Groups feature through its paces by creating and joining lots of Dungeon and 3v3 Arena groups. During the playtest, you&#x2019;ll have a chance to encounter members of the Warcraft Development Team like Watcher, Celestalon, and Holinka, in addition to QA, CS, and CM team members as we join you for a Dungeon run or Arena match.<br>
<br>
What: Create Premade Groups, run Dungeons, and 3v3 Arena groups with Blizzard employees!<br>
When: Thursday, August 21, 2014 from 03:00 PM to 05:00 PM PDT.<br>
Where: Level 100 PvE and Level 100 PvP Beta realms<br>
How you&#x2019;ll know they&#x2019;re a Blue: Blizzard employees will be in a guild called Blizzard Alliance or Blizzard Horde respectively for the duration of the event.<br>
<br>
How to create a Premade Group:<br>
<br>
For Dungeons, access the Group Finder pane (bound to I key by default.) Select Premade Groups --&gt; Dungeons --&gt; Find a Group or Start a GroupOr<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
Racials<br>
Why keep racials? Why not just give us a pool of racials to choose from so we can play the race we want over obligatory min/max?<br>
Because at its heart, WoW is a fantasy roleplaying game. Min/Maxing becomes a lot less &quot;obligatory&quot; with trivial differences. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499659833679695873))<br>
<br>
Classes<br>
Question: Since absorbs cause problems for healers (Disc priests), why not change absorbs to % incoming damage reduction?<br>
That&apos;s an extremely different thing, would be cause way more problems. Regardless, absorbs don&apos;t cause problems like that in WoD (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499062978772074496))<br>
It&apos;s just not the snipe-heavy world where absorbs were king, anymore. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499063064361066496))<br>
<br>
What is the design goal of glyphs in WoD? Seeing a lot of glyphs with small dps benefits.<br>
Small *situational* DPS gains are fine. Sometimes that situation may be rather broad, such as &quot;When there&apos;s cleave&quot; though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499201741921857537))<br>
<br>
Celestalon, do you understand what RNG stands for? It stands for RANDOM, when is RANDOM reliable? What drugs are you on?<br>
When it&apos;s extremely common and there are tons of chances. That&apos;s when. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499376563104661504))<br>

Whoever came up with glyph of flap needs a raise. Moonkin form only?<br>
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/498990517032460288))<br>
<br>
Any hope for a female Claws of Shervallah model in the future or will the gals be stuck with a male body builders physique?<br>
It&apos;s something we&apos;re considering for the future, but weren&apos;t able to get in for 6.0. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499257700249653249))<br>

Any chance of ever seeing Mountable Hunter Pets / Tameable Mounts? Seeing lots of good looking models usable for both.<br>
Super cool idea, requires a lot of tech to get it working right, maybe sometime! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/499039064809410560))<br>

Please, tell something about Stormstrike with 2-handed weapons, i&apos;m worried about it very much. <br>
We have no current plans to bring back 2H Enhancement. Sorry. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499259160777601024))<br>
But why did you change requirements for Stormstrike? We have been able to cast it with 2-hand at least 6 years, why it over?<br>
To reduce confusion. It was a trap. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499263462199943168))<br>

Really, what is the point of forced CD from Defensive Stance? Can we get just a bit of feedback?<br>
The point is so that defensive abilities (Devastate/Revenge) don&apos;t become filler abilities during empty GCDs while DPSing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499019095115714560))<br>
If just you make Dev/Rev do shit damage but really high threat nobody would bother swapping stances to use them for DPS. Win-Win<br>
That&apos;s not true. &quot;shit&quot; damage is better than zero damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499020664758493185))<br>
<br>
well D stance is now uselss... so what is a DK&apos;s down side to Blood prez?<br>
A big DPS loss and in the case of Unholy movement speed. The other presences do have benefits. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499025437561860097))<br>
since Dks existed sitting in blood prez doesn&apos;t really effect them as much as you think.<br>
It&apos;s a DPS loss and a movement speed loss. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499026366528897026))<br>
and frost dks don&apos;t lose much either... Not trying to be rude but have you actually pvped in the 2k+ bracket?<br>
Do you even 2k bro? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499028083710504960))<br>
lol a dev with some humor, the sad part is I&apos;m being serious... Dk can sit in BP and still pit out offensive pressure<br>
they can still put out pressure, but it&apos;s less pressure. Arguably this is even more the case for Frost. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499028640454041600))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
Will there be any time soon more vanity xmog &#xED;tems such as Jewel of the Firelord and friends? That&apos;d be cool<br>
Some, but we&apos;re a bit concerned about overloading bagspace before a better system is implemented (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/499313206360154113))<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br>
Do u mean they&apos;re back to just agi/str/int increases again?<br>
Flasks are back to primary stats. All of the others are still secondary stats. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/498996928353271809))<br>
<br>
If its that easy, then askmrrobot will change from &quot;enchant/gem/forge this to that&quot; to &quot;eat/enchant/gem&quot; Still same<br>
Perhaps... Except the directions will amount to &quot;Get Haste&quot; instead of two dozen specific reforge/gem lines. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499010607601815552))<br>
<br>
How? I&apos;m not saying removing reforging is good/bad, I just want to know how you can stack a specific stat MORE w/o.<br>
Two cases to consider: Typical, and Ideal.Typical: 40% of secondaries in BestStat, 25% / 15% / 15% / 5% in other secondaries. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499008665454518272))<br>
In Mists, you&apos;d reforge that to 44% / 35% / 9% / 9% / 3%.In Warlords, you&apos;d enchant/food/gem to 50% / 21% / 13% / 13% / 4%. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499008744605241344))<br>
And Ideal is super simple. In that case, every item has your best stat, so reforging did nothing. Enchants are pure upgrade. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499008821679763456))<br>
what if i want a stat than is not my attunemented stat? lets say... mastery for a resto druid?<br>
Then great, stack that. This doesn&apos;t limit that in any way. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499011511541452800))<br>
<br>
Versatility can you honestly say this it plays a part? You will never prio it with its bad ratio, reign that in pls instead.<br>
I don&apos;t understand what you&apos;re asking, but yes, Versatility will be valuable. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499001116260958208))<br>
How will it be valuable? Would prioritize it or do you force us to. Wont beat your attuned stats nor will it be with #2 stat<br>
It will be valuable where its hybridity is useful, especially the damage reduction. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499009127608098817))<br>
So a secondary stat built around situational hybridity? I&apos;m sorry this stat needs rethinking, This will never stick in mythic.<br>
Actually, I suspect that there are many cases where Mythic guilds will sacrifice 2% damage for 5% *passive* damage reduction. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499013536031334401))<br>
<br>
you said several hundred from gems. while that could be as low as 2 gems, it implies several, or &quot;tons&quot; of gems<br>
I&apos;m not giving out exact chances of sockets, but 2+ on your character will not be unusual. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499015236293115904))<br>
<br>
Can we just have 1 Flask which changes with your spec (similar to gear)? Choosing between int/agi as a MW is going to be hard.<br>
If secondary stat flasks were &quot;too strong&quot; why not nerf them rather than removing them? Less choice = bad, surely?<br>
It&apos;s all part of a combined package, not just individual parts. Enchants (Armor and Weapon), Food, and Gems, still remain. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499012149910315008))<br>
You can understand frustration right? Being able to switch flasks depending on encounter was fun/engaging. Int/stam/agi/str isnt<br>
Sure, I can understand the immediate reaction; it&apos;ll be OK once people get a better view of the full picture (trying to help!) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499013311824818176))<br>
The nerfs to enchants to reduce secondary stat stacking? 30% crit buffed as a MW pre-t17 hc gear felt a little insane!<br>
Yep. See my other recent tweets. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499015381181136896))<br>
<br>
do you think it will be possible to hit haste or crit caps in the final tier of WoD?<br>
Haste has a relatively low *soft* cap. With procs, that&apos;ll be hittable. We don&apos;t see a way around that. Crit, not likely. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499016562880172033))<br>
<br>
You&apos;re adding gem sockets back to most gear and not just warforged?<br>
Gems and Warforged are separate. Both can be on all Warlords gear. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499011315352883200))<br>
Aren&apos;t they also supposed to be limited by rng? Saying you can stack tons of gems is misleading.<br>
They are RNG-tied. But I definitely did not say you could stack tons of gems. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499012543176650752))<br>
You can&apos;t really say gems for customizing if its pure rng if you can use them are not.<br>
Just because something is random doesn&apos;t mean that they can&apos;t be expected to be used. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499019765621342208))<br>
<br>
&quot;Several Hundred From Gems&quot; YOUR EXACT WORDS. That means you EXPECT us to try and stack gems.<br>
I&apos;m guessing that you&apos;re significantly misunderstanding something. That&apos;s a mere 2 sockets, which is quite common. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499359185696329728))<br>
A &quot;Mere&quot; 2 sockets that are still RNG based. Try spending weeks on a 16% drop rate and getting NOTHING. Zero Control.<br>
There&apos;s this misconception that anything RNG involved is bad or unreliable. That&apos;s wrong. This is not rare. Relax. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499364657421754368))<br>
DST would like to say hi. Warglaives during progression are hosting a &quot;Reliable RNG drop party&quot; for you 3<br>
Yeah... You&apos;re misunderstanding. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499381510584016896))<br>
What am I understanding? That RNG is still RNG and it will never be reliable? That&apos;s kind of what RNG is, it&apos;s a dice roll.<br>
You&apos;re looking at this from the point of view of &quot;this guy&apos;s an idiot lol&quot;. Try looking at it from &quot;What am I misunderstanding?&quot; (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499383129346297856))<br>
Here&apos;s an example: Do you wear any dropped gear? All dropped gear is random, but you don&apos;t say that &quot;zomg it&apos;s RNG USELESS&quot;, right? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499383340001017856))<br>
Sure, some specific pieces may be quite rare, and RNG can make it unreliable to get specific pieces. But that doesn&apos;t happen to... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499383624429355009))<br>
...every slot. Sockets can appear on all gear. That&apos;s huge, and makes it reliable that you&apos;ll get some. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499384024586928128))<br>
Now do you see why RNG will never be reliable? If RNG would be reliable casinos would go out business.<br>
No. Really, no. That&apos;s not how probability or statistics works. And casinos work because they average &lt;100% payout. They take a cut. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499387635731685376))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Curious on how unlocking Mythic will work in Highmaul with 3 optional. 7/7 Heroic killed or just an Imperator kill necessary?<br>
No achievement requirement to enter Mythic. You could always bypass it by getting someone to start your raid, anyway. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/499042431426248705))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
is a 200 conquest Ashran bonus number the most you can earn a week in Ashran? <br>
it&apos;s 200 extra conquest you can only get in Ashran. You can get more than 200 in Ashran though. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499040299264786432))<br>
Does that mean that ashran is considered &apos;mandatory&apos; pvping? If you don&apos;t do ashran every week you fall behind someone who is?<br>
Only if someone is being unreasonable. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499041796878770176))<br>
Heh, you don&apos;t understand the psychology of your player base much do you?<br>
The broader playerbase or the very engaged ones on twitter and the forums? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499055055538909185))<br>
<br>
Can you expand more on the conquest rewards from Ashran? As a person who does not enjoy arena, loved hearing conq earned in ashran<br>
The current plan is to reward conquest for conquering the enemy base or winning one of the dynamic events in the outer areas. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499391784321966080))<br>
<br>
Is there a limit in the inflation/MMR system or will we really end up 3300+ rating?<br>
There is a limit but I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll get there. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499009557884973057))<br>
Slight tangent: Why doesn&apos;t WoW arena use a SC3 style bracket system? Would love Josh Menke&apos;s insights on this.<br>
I&apos;ve had a lot of conversations about the SC and WoW brackets with Josh and David Kim. Both systems have pros/cons. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499054891461926912))<br>
Being constantly reminded your Bronze/Silver isn&apos;t always fun but at least you have milestones. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499055807174963200))<br>
But we talk a lot about blue sky ideas for a better progression and rewards system. Such a big change would need to be home run. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499056144191463425))<br>
<br>
got a question for ya. In WoD, can you obtain strong boxes just for queuing specifically for a BG?<br>
No, only for random battlegrounds. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499323567964557313))<br>
what will the reward be for winning a specific que then? Will honor still be given?<br>
Same as before, honor in the battleground. Strong boxes replaced the 270/135 honor you would get. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499432207367172097))<br>
