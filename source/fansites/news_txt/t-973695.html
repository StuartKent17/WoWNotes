A set with the flavor of the Old Gods about it - General Vezax from the Ulduar raid was a reference point. Any warlock tier is a great opportunity to bring a dark and warped aesthetic to player gear and this set was especially ripe for the treatment.<br>
<br>
Replacing the caster&#x2019;s face with writhing tentacles was the &#x2018;hook&#x2019; I started the concept with and built out from there. We always try to include numerous points of illumination into a tier set as it helps to tie the various armour pieces together &#x2013; whether that be glowing gemstones, fiery runes or, as in this case, bulging otherworldly eyes!<br>
