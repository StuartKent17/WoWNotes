According to this screenshot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/geardr1.jpg) you can&apos;t swap gear in Arena since the latest build of the PTR patch. This could mean that this is a 2.2 feature, but it&apos;s still unsure because in a previous blue post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=965654657&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#5) Nethaera stated that it wouldn&apos;t be in this patch. <br>
<br>
2.2 Item changes<br>
Update : All screenshots are now updated with 2.2 PTR / 2.1 Live comparison. <br>
<br>
Yesterday, some items were changed during the PTR Patch. I&apos;d say that my list is pretty much complete now. (I&apos;ll add a screenshot of the Serpentshrine Shuriken and probably try to get a better version of enchantments when PTRs are back up)<br>
<br>
New paladin shield (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/illidariruneshield.jpg). (Ilvl 141, could drop from pretty much anything in Hyjal or Black Temple, technically it could also drop from Vashj or Kael&apos;Thas now that the ilvl of their loot is 141, but it&apos;s doubtful)<br>
All the weapons from Serpentshrine Cavern (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/sscchanges2.jpg) were upgraded (Including Wildfury Greatstaff (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/wildfurychanges.jpg) and Serpentshrine Shuriken (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/serpentshrineshuriken2.jpg) from trash).<br>
All the weapons from Tempest Keep (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/tkchanges2.jpg) were upgraded. <br>
The amount of reagents needed for several enchantments (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/enchantchanges3.jpg) has been lowered.<br>
[item=21756] cooldown has been changed from 30 minutes to 20 minutes.<br>
[item=23565] attack power bonus has been changed from 58 to 84<br>
[item=23576] required level has been changed from 55 to 60<br>
[item=30067], [item=32540], and [item=32541] now requires 300 in enchantment skill to be disenchanted. <br>

Tigole interview on Mondespersistants.com<br>
Mondespersistants.com (http://wow.mondespersistants.com/?article=403&amp;page_art=2), a french fansite, has interviewed Tigole and Chris Robinson during the Games Convention, the video and the transcript (in both english and french) is now available here (http://wow.mondespersistants.com/?article=403&amp;page_art=2).<br>
<br>
As usual here is a short summary :<br>
Arthas will &quot;use&quot; both alliance and horde players to defeat things that cannot be defeated by his brainless minions, the same way the Lich King used Arthas in the first place.<br>
Death Knight will probably be able to use and inscribe any weapon with runes. (Even if they might add a few Death Knight specific weapons)<br>
Few things about instance we already know, Azjol&apos;Nerub will be a mega-huge underground zone full of spiders, the Nexus will have 3 instances and you will fight Malygos in the last one (lvl 80, 25 players).<br>
They might change old battlegrounds like AV, but they&apos;re still not sure if they will be able to do it because of the heavy changes it implies. <br>
Mal&apos;ganis (http://www.wowwiki.com/Mal&apos;Ganis) will be the final boss of CoT : Stratholme.<br>
Sunwell Plateau will have 6 bosses in the 25 man raid dungeon, and a 5 people normal and heroic instance. <br>
A &quot;famous character&quot; is trying to re-ignite the sunwell and summons Kil&apos;jaeden back. <br>
<br>

Wrath of the Lich King<br>
Rise of the Lich King (Chapter 3) (http://www.wow-europe.com/wrath/features.xml) is now available on the official website. <br>
