Monks Will be Able To Use Recruit a Friend Bonuses
We're not making any changes to the way RaF bonuses function, which means monks won't be excluded from receiving the benefits of RaF when Mists of Pandaria is released. 

Will they still get realm first achievements?
Yes. 

Will Scroll of Resurrection be available to instant level a monk to 80?
No. That's answered here  


Theramore Event Will not Be Tested
Is the World Event for the Attack on Theramore Isle going to be available for testing soon?
We are not currently planning on opening this up for public/beta testing. That may change but for right now we're testing it internally.
