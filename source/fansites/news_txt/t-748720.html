Cataclysm Beta - Build 12759<br>
A new build is being deployed on beta realms, just like any beta build, it will be painful, a lot of stuff will break, and I have no idea if I&apos;ll be able to give you all the content on the first day.<br>
<br>
On the upside, Thrall is getting a new model. Stay tuned for changes!<br>

Creature Damage Output Changes<br>
Creature damage output has been increased from roughly level 65 and up. These increases scale upward with level. Creatures in exterior zones at level 80 now have 2.5 times the damage output they did previously in beta, 3.2 times at level 81, and 4 times at level 82 and up.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;d like to get your feedback about how combat feels with creatures in level 80-85 exterior zones, including spawn rates and numbers of creatures in specific locations in each zone. Please let us know if this feels adequately challenging, or if there is a little too much face rocking going on. <br>
