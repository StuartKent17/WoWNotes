Cataclysm Screenshots
The screenshot of the day on the official site has been updated with a view of the ... Blasted Lands. Not kidding http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24630853478/screenshot-of-the-day-revived-for-cataclysm/. The two other screenshots are most likely the Swamp of Sorrows and Tirisfal Glades.
