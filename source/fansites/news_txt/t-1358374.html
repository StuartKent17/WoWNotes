WoW Source: Patch 5.4 Developer Round Table<br>
Blizzard released a video that gives an overview of Patch 5.4 and then answers some of your questions (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/268538-looking-for-your-questions/).<br>
<br>
<br>
Over 50% of Flex Raids last week had 2 or more raid sizes, so people are really making use of the flexible size feature.<br>
Roughly the same amount of people did a flex raid last week as the number that did scenarios. <br>
The Timeless Isle is somewhat of a template for endgame world content going forward. There might be some more structure in the future, but the general style of content that avoids pure daily quests worked well. <br>
Adding things in the world to discover while leveling will also be a goal moving forward.<br>
As far as storage space goes, choosing what to keep is part of the gameplay. No matter how much bag space players are given, it will always end up being full.<br>
Heirlooms are taking up a lot of space, so a centralized storage like the one used for pets and mounts is being worked on. The toy items added in Mists of Pandaria also take up a lot of space, so a similar solution for that would also be ideal.<br>
Siege of Orgrimmar is one of the more melee friendly raid zones that have been added recently. The devs are looking for things melee players can excel at or perks they can have without taking tools away from ranged players.<br>
The Gnome race didn&apos;t exist when the original WoW cinematic was being worked on, which is why they didn&apos;t appear in it. There hasn&apos;t been a good opportunity to showcase gnomes in a cinematic since then.<br>
Patch 5.4.1 will add a new Refer a Friend system. The whole process will be moved in game, rather than requiring you to visit the site in your browser. The system will give you a token which you can redeem for the new mount, one of the other mounts, or a pet.<br>
Blizzcon will have &quot;an exciting glimpse into the future of WoW&quot;, as well as a live raid.<br>

Rated Battleground Ratings Adjustments<br>
As you may be aware, we recently made a change to Rated Battleground queues that makes players wait until the match has ended to queue for a new Rated Battleground, even if they had left that match. This change allowed us to close a loophole some were using to artificially inflate their ratings, but unfortunately quite a bit of abuse had already occurred by the time we implemented the fix. Our goal now is to restore as much integrity to the Rated Battleground ladders as possible, and we&#x2019;ll be doing that in two key ways.<br>
<br>
During our next maintenance we&#x2019;ll be lowering all Rated Battleground personal and matchmaking ratings for those above 2200 down to 2200. The abuse was widespread to a point that many legitimate players&#x2019; ratings have been inflated just because they&#x2019;ve played against those who had used the loophole to boost their rating, and so we need to get everyone back to some equal footing. But secondly we&#x2019;ll be taking action against the accounts for those who knowingly and purposely abused the exploit to boost their rating, which will result in more than just their rating being reduced.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll be keeping a close eye on things, and looking to take swift action for any further issues.<br>

The Crowd Chose You Buff<br>
We&apos;re not really happy with how The Crowd Chose You is working out at the moment. We&apos;re exploring a few options for exactly what we&apos;d like to do, but we will be changing it.<br>
<br>
what&apos;s the PTR for?<br>
I also totally get the concern that these sorts of changes should be happening on PTR and not live. In an ideal world, they would be. Thing is, the PTR is such a different environment, especially for PvP, that we really don&apos;t see the same sort of player behaviors on the test realms that we do on live. There&apos;s a lot fewer players, and those that do test aren&apos;t worried about getting high ratings as much as they are just trying out new changes.<br>
<br>
That makes sense, and we don&apos;t really expect players to behave any differently than they do. It just means that, sometimes, issues that crop up on PTR don&apos;t extend to live. In this case, we saw the issues cropping up on PTR, but there was a reasonable case to be made that those behaviors wouldn&apos;t work on a live environment, where players would care more about their ratings, or the higher pool of players would mean those tactics weren&apos;t as successful as often. So, we decided to give The Crowd Chose You a shot, while also starting to think about what we could do if the issues persisted. <br>
<br>
In hindsight, sure, it would have been better if we&apos;d done something else to begin with, instead of making the change a couple weeks into the PvP season. Ultimately, we made a bad call, which is why we&apos;re working to make some changes now. Just be aware that making those calls isn&apos;t as simple as looking at how things are on the PTR. It can be pretty difficult to decide who to listen to sometimes. <br>

Soul Link + Unending Resolve glyph.<br>
There&apos;s a huge difference between giving up major defensive cooldowns for a passive effect and just having a passive effect on top of everything else. <br>
<br>
In the case the OP laid out, the Warlock is effectively sacrificing two major cooldowns: Unending Resolve, and either Demonic Sacrifice or Dark Bargain. That&apos;s a pretty hefty price to pay, and though it certainly seems to be a popular choice at the moment (and we can discuss whether or not it&apos;s too strong), it&apos;s still a choice. We like choices. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/273891-soul-link-unending-resolve-glyph/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10160426698?page=2#25))<br>

Warcraft Story<br>
My point is that I feel like for WoW to get exciting again we need a new storyline, new heroes and new villians that we can all love and hate. <br>
This is not the first time I have been reading a comment like this, and it is one that I personally find to very interesting due to the vastness that is the Warcraft lore... There are so many different storylines in the Warcraft universe, some obviously more known than others, but which ones would be the most interesting ones for the future?<br>
<br>
It could be cool if you guys would share some specifics on what you have in mind when you say that you want a new storyline... are you talking about a continuation of existing storylines, or a restart of the Warcraft storyline overall? Also, do you have a particular storyline you would find more interesting than others? <br>
<br>
Some people have already answered questions like these in the story forum, sometimes quite extensively, but in this thread I think a few lines will suffice.
