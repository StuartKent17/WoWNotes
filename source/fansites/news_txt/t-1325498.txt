Ghostcrawler Interview
Ghostcrawler has been in Asia this week and PlayersCut http://www.youtube.com/user/PlayersCutTV?feature=watch was able to sit down with him for an interview http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Y00yDo-Ss.


Patch 5.4 is the final raid patch for Mists of Pandaria and ends with players defeating Garrosh and setting events in motion for a new warchief. Unfortunately, we will have to wait a little bit longer to see who that will be. 
The devs aren't ready to talk about any WoW 10th anniversary events yet, but they are still working on plans for it. 
The team takes more of a long term view of when making changes now. They are thinking about not only the next expansion, but the one after that when they make changes.
The amount of class spells has continued to rise over the years, so Mists of Pandaria made an attempt to cut down on the excess. Future expansions will make a bigger effort to do so as well.
Adding additional spell effects for classes is nice, but it has to be balanced with adding even more visual noise to raid encounters. Bosses and player skills that are used less frequently will likely get the more impressive effects, rather than the filler spells used in rotations.
There are a few leveling areas that need stronger guards, such as around the Dark Portal in Blasted Lands.
Adding a new classes has to be done cautiously, but adding another hero class in the future is still a possibility.
Monks were not a hero class because the low level story of the Wandering Isle fit them very well, but their population is still low due to having to level them up from level 1. 
WoW won't be going free to play anytime soon, as Blizzard is happy with the current business model. Even if they wanted to make it into a microtransaction based game, it couldn't be done with how gameplay works today. 
The devs want people to be able to catch up faster so that they can play with friends, which is why they are testing the experience buff http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/146939-enduring-elixir-of-wisdom and other convenience items in the Blizzard store. There is no desire to move towards a pay to win style game.



Patch 5.3 Hotfixes - July 26
Creatures

Spirit of Warlord Teng should now properly give credit towards the It Was Worth Every Ritual Stone achievement when defeated.


Isle of Thunder

Additional fixes for situations where players using incantations to summon bosses were receiving the error message "You can't do that right now."

FEEDBACK: Vale of Eternal Sorrows Flexible
Creature health and damage should scale completely dynamically as people come and go, as well as mechanics interactions such as the number of puddles into which Immerseus splits. The number by your minimap should be an accurate indication of your current instance group size.

For testing purposes mostly internal convenience on our end, you can currently queue with a fairly small group, but nothing will actually scale below a 10-player size. When we release 5.4, we're intending to require a minimum of 8 players to queue. The thought there is that you might want to begin clearing the instance or at least zone in and get ready while waiting on a latecomer 9th/10th, and if we set the queue limit strictly to 10, that wouldn't be possible.

DPS Legendary gem no longer procs for tanks
One extra note: we will be buffing the Tank Indomitable meta gem in a future build. We'll be removing the haste scaling from its proc chance, but increasing its base chance by 50%. That should make it activate much more regularly, even for tanks who stack haste, than the previous iteration.

We recognize that a lot of tanks are preferring the DPS meta gem at the moment, and we'd like to correct that, but we'd like to do it by making you like the tank gem, not by nerfing the DPS gem.

Legendary Cloacks and Procs Feedback
It's that easy? It doesn't take 3 months of raiding Siege of Orgrimmar to get the legendary cloak? We can get the cloaks the day 5.4 goes live??? 
Assuming you're all caught up on the quest, yes! You should be able to get your legendary cloak pretty quickly once Patch 5.4 hits.

The reasoning is simple: we want you to be able to use it for progression. Past legendaries including the earlier bits of the Mists of Pandaria chain have typically taken a pretty decent amount of time before you're able to get them. That's great for heading into the next tier or finishing up the current one, but when the next tier is in a new expansion, it can leave them feeling a little... flat. You end up using them mostly for farm, and then you replace them once the next expansion hits and you outlevel them.

It also feels a little strange thematically. "We need to properly gear you for the fight against the Lich King so uh... go kill the Lich King!" Bit awkward, but required for gameplay purposes. A legendary doesn't feel terribly legendary if there's no effort involved in obtaining it.

So, since you've been working so closely with Wrathion over the course of the expansion already, it makes sense that he'd want to equip you properly for the final resolution of the Alliance vs Horde conflict -- before you set foot in Orgrimmar. And since you've put in so much effort up til this point starting in patch 5.0 and continuing up through patch 5.3, we don't really need to add more.

We've obviously been experimenting a bit with how players earn legendaries in this expansion, so continued feedback both on how you earn them as well as the actual legendary items themselves is extremely valuable. Thanks!

Is it possible to examine how the legendary cloak works for Hunters? Having it work as a frontal cone in front of our pets just seems to be working very wonky due to the nature of pet mechanics and AI.
We actually have an alternate proc in the works for Hunters, we just weren't able to get it ready in time for this PTR push. Giving you the melee proc off of your pets was just a temporary measure.

Enhancement Tier 16 Bonus
Indeed! We agree that the 5.3 Enhancement rotation isn't ideal for some AoE situations, and we're keeping a close eye on how the Enhancement Tier 16 4-piece bonus plays out. Depending on how that goes, we may either make it or something similar baseline, or try something else entirely.

And AE healing is just too strong. Why cast 4 HL when I can just cast 1 HR and achieve roughly the same in 1/4 time?
The idea is supposed to be the HR is wasted mana if it overheals. If it does not overheal, then it was the appropriate choice. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361066109031559169
