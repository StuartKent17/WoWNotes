This Tuesday, February 9, at 3:00 p.m. PST, tune in live at Twitch.tv/Warcraft (http://twitch.tv/Warcraft) to watch several top World of Warcraft streamers, YouTubers, and personalities from Europe and North America race against the clock&#x2014;and each other&#x2014;in some of the new max-level dungeons coming in World of Warcraft: Legion.<br>
<br>
Our two teams will be racing through two dungeons: The Maw of Souls, a brand-new dungeon not yet available in the Legion Alpha, and the Heroic difficulty version of Halls of Valor, home of the greatest warriors of the vrykul. While these teams have had some practice with Halls of Valor on lower difficulty, this will be the first time any adventurer has set foot in The Maw of Souls&#x2014;all these two teams know is to expect the unexpected!<br>
<br>
For this challenge, we&#x2019;ve assembled a colossal collection of some of the biggest names in the World of Warcraft community. Representing Europe: Treckie (http://blizz.ly/1nzvJIO), Bellular (http://blizz.ly/1OQCGxJ), Qelric (http://blizz.ly/1ROJhN1), and Alex and Loz of FatbossTV (http://blizz.ly/1ROJjEr). To face off against them, representing North America: Towelliee (http://blizz.ly/1NC7Sg0), Killars (http://blizz.ly/1Us1mON), Monkioh (http://blizz.ly/1QtK7LI), and Tattva and Tovo of Line of Sight Gaming (http://blizz.ly/1PTWw97). Both of these teams have a ton of experience, knowledge, and history with World of Warcraft&#x2014;but will it be enough to triumph?<br>
<br>
Assistant Game Director Ion &#x201C;Watcher&#x201D; Hazzikostas will join Community Manager Josh &#x201C;Lore&#x201D; Allen to provide commentary and insight as each team fights through the dungeons in a race to earn the fastest time possible. The winning team will claim victory not only for themselves, but for the region they represent!<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll have all of the action live at Twitch.tv/Warcraft this Tuesday, February 9 at 3:00 p.m. PST (check here (http://blizz.ly/1RPLVSC) to find that in your local time zone). We&#x2019;ll see you there!</div></div>
