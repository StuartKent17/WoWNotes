Heart of Azeroth

The faction that wins will inherit a dying world
Magni will grant players the Heart of Azeroth artifact, a neck piece gifted from our planet's titan.
Heart is a new take on the artifact system without the linear path
When the Heart gains Azerite it levels up and gains new abilities for three pieces of specified armor and itself.
Gaining azerite will level up your Heart over time and unlock ranks that give the player an assortment of abilities to choose from on ever expanding tiers of rings.
Every time you loot a new item, your Heart's power remains the same. You keep moving forward. It doesn't lose the azerite from the item being upgraded but may present you with different abilities from your previous choices.
The strength of individual azerite abilities is determined by the item level of the piece of armor.
Example: Character Shaman has a Heart of Azeroth power of 20, which unlocks 2 rings on the neck. The 3rd requires level 21. Said shaman can choose 1 ability from the first 2 ring tiers to empower, such as increased ghost wolf speed or more damage reduction on astral shift. When she unlocks the 3rd ring by gaining azerite, she gets to choose between several different abilities in that tier to empower. This tailors your character individually from everyone else. In this example, the shaman gets to chose between survivability or mobility.
Choices will always be individual and new choices are made throughout the entire expansion.
