Legion - Treasure Demons
Several players in the Alpha have reported seeing the Treasure Demon  appear and start casting an Escape Portal  It appears to activate a counter that counts down as it escapes, possibly giving you more loot if you kill it faster. It drops gold and Sanctuary Coins

[Legion Mage] Liking talent placement in datamined build, RoP looks cool, hope it drops at feet, CD is prolly a PH
Rune of Power changes are not complete yet. It should have 2 charges, 45sec recharge, and drop at your feet. WarcraftDevs 

Art
Hail May Male Nelf get more druidic long beards in the future? I'd love my DH to look like this 
we're keeping track of these desires, no guarantees but they aren't falling on deaf ears artofcgrobinson 

 I wouldn't even entertain this. Since WC3, Orcs have hunched. Don't cave, Chris.
.what if it was an option and not a requirement/forced change? I get the argument, hero orcs aren't hunched, cont. artofcgrobinson 
.if we did this IMO we would need to give U the choice of which posture you feel most reps your character artofcgrobinson 
That's, like, the perfect solution. Could the Forsaken get the same treatment?
I fundamentally feel like forsaken posture is appropriate for the character, orcs are different artofcgrobinson 

I know the plan is to match visual color to weapon but pls consider leaving red flame on blue sword 
that does look cool, will consider artofcgrobinson 

Hey man, I love plate armor sets, was wondering if y'all could maybe use this model  on newer sets 
I'm pretty sure we are, those are used primarily for leather/cloth but we occasionally find a way to sneak them into plate artofcgrobinson 

Why are Mr. Didier's quotes all through the Art of World of Warcraft book?!
Samwise started all of this with original Warcraft games, any WoW art book would be incomplete without his words artofcgrobinson 
he also continues to contribute to WoW whenever he can - he painted the goblin and worgen crests for instance artofcgrobinson 

PvP
Is there any way we could get a "Target only players" checkbox in controls tab for legion? same as /targetenemyplayer macro
Target Next Enemy Player exists in the keybinds holinka 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
what is your view of the ability pruning going on in WoW? Are they going overboard or is it warranted to the extent used?
I'm not familiar enough to have an informed opinion. It is hard to add new abilities when bars are full. OccupyGStreet 

Did u get legion alpha? I'm currently a happynot member of No-access club
I did not. I know people, but since I'm not actively playing, it seems mean to deny someone who might appreciate it more. OccupyGStreet 

do you get alpha/beta access on the FF list since your a former dev? always wondered about that.
I rarely ever get early access as a courtesy. Often other devs are the last people you want seeing your unfinished game. OccupyGStreet 
Ah that's an interesting thought thinking about it, did you go to blizzcon this year btw? If not, do you plan on going again?
I didn't go this year. I had hoped to but it didn't feel right. Maybe next year. OccupyGStreet 
It's for Blizzard, not me, and I worry about the way it would come across, like who does he think he is? OccupyGStreet 

Do you ever think that the events of Wrath were a bit too soon? I, personally, feel like that was the big finish.
It was interesting how many players considered that the end of the story. OccupyGStreet 
I always considered the story to be orcs vs humans, since those were the original two RTS games. Shrug. OccupyGStreet 
It probs comes from the majority of players being active from WC3 to Wrath but I feel the corrupted hero story resounds more
Even before I was at Blizzard, I always said: if in doubt, make the hero become corrupted Arthas, Kerrigan, Diablo... OccupyGStreet 


Computers - Setup of the Month
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices  are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. No new hardware that is worth waiting for is expected anytime soon. 

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 6700K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date. Don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions!
