Patch 6.2.4 Hotfixes - May 24: Leveling Hotfixes<br>
Note from the developers:<br>
<br>
Over the past couple of weeks, we&#x2019;ve rolled out a series of hotfixes aimed at improving overall pacing and playability of the low-level (1-20) experience. We started by adding a number of modern conveniences to our low-level quest experience, and will continue to roll these improvements forward across other legacy content in the future. We&#x2019;ve also made some improvements to the overall pace of combat at low levels: Due to the accumulated effect of years&#x2019; worth of max-level tuning adjustments, many classes were killing low-level enemies nearly instantaneously, even without heirloom gear or other advantages. A summary of the hotfixes follows:<br>
<br>
<br>
Most quest bosses from level 1-20 should now be multitap and will scale their health with the numbers of players fighting them.<br>
Added dynamic respawn behavior to most level 1-20 outdoor areas, so that spawns will be more readily available during times of high player traffic.<br>
Players who die in low-level dungeons should now release to the entrance of the dungeon, consistent with the practice in dungeons from more recent expansions.<br>
Level 1-10 enemy NPCs now deal slightly more damage.<br>
Reduced the bonus to out-of-combat health regeneration that players receive when below level 20.<br>
Reduced player damage at low levels to improve overall combat pacing. In general, Strength and Agility classes saw a larger reduction in damage than did casters. Damage dealt is unchanged from level 40 onwards.<br>
<br>
<br>
We see these changes as the beginning, rather than an endpoint &#x2013; much work remains to improve tuning and pacing of the old-world level-up experience, and our efforts will continue into Legion and beyond.<br>

PvP<br>
How many prestige ranks are there? And do they increase in amount needed per level for the next rank?<br>
At launch there will be 4 Prestige Ranks and additional ranks will be added each season. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/732677374177775616))<br>
<br>
in #legion pvp will secondary stats be normalized too? If I want to do a mastery build in pvp will it just get flattened out?<br>
Correct. The secondary stats on your gear will not matter in PvP instances. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/732677265494970368))<br>
