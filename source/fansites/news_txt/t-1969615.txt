True Aim triggers on Arcane Shot but not on Sidewinders?
We will change this to apply to your primary target with Sidewinders as well. WarcraftDevs 

Do all Hunters share the same Marked for Death debuff on a target?
Nope. This debuff is individual per Hunter. WarcraftDevs

Living Bomb not spreadable with Inferno blast
We’re working on a slightly different idea for how LB spreads... Have you tried Kael’thas’ Chain Bomb? WarcraftDevs 

Whats behind making Blink a totally useless ability?
Assuming you’re talking about the stun break—this is a tooltip error. The stun break has not been changed. WarcraftDevs 

Good to know, I'm assuming Shimmer doesn't break stuns then? Would be pretty ridiculous in PvP if it did.
This is correct; Shimmer does not break stuns. WarcraftDevs

Final Verdict also increases the damage on Blade of Vengeance by 20%. Seems to be a bug, right?
A bug, indeed. We'll get this fixed, thanks! WarcraftDevs

Umm, is Screeching gears supposed to stun 5x in a row?Frog Kiss 4x in a row,thought the debuff prevented that? #Clueless
the debuff doesn't kick in until the stun wears off, allowing for stun-lengthening combos, both have gotten a nerf in Legion Muffinus 
the chance at being stunned 5x in a row currently is less than 0.1% though that is some supreme RNG unluck Muffinus
