Shapeshifting breaks most of the visual effects (like Hallow&apos;s End transformations) because some really weird stuff could happen by combining multiple effects. This way, the devs can design and add new effects without too much restriction because of spells not working together.

Hypothermia duration got increased because 30 seconds was short enough to let mages buy the time needed to iceblock a second time. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366705803&amp;postId=24689974844&amp;sid=1#4))<br>

Most of the major changes to the discipline tree shouldn&apos;t happen before WotLK (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366699604&amp;postId=24746667148&amp;sid=1#53))<br>

2.3 Patch testing<br>
The arena season state is not persisting after a server reset, this is why the arena vendors keep disappearing. Also, the new arena UI is not displaying when Season 3 starts so you can not see your personal rating. Both of these issues will be fixed in an upcoming PTR build.

The broom mount only have a 14 days duration to let people get it without having to worry about keeping it as a special rare mount, this is also why the droprate is so high. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366736475&amp;postId=24711474733&amp;sid=1#12))<br>
