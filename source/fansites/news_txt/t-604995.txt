Boubouille2008-02-18, 08:18 AMArena Season 4 Preview !
It looks like a few Season 4 items are now available on PTRs, maybe we'll get the rest of them very soon. 


 

   

   

As you can see, they use these sets are using the same models as the Sunwell Armor, that's a good news because it means I can use the screenshots I posted yesterday as a Season 4 armor sets preview without any additional work !
