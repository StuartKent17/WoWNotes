Paragon http://www.paragon-wow.com/ didn't need a lot of time to prove that they didn't need Holy Wrath to kill Anub'arak in Heroic Mode. They did it again a few minutes ago and are also the first guild to achieve A Tribute to Mad Skill 25 Player http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3818/a-tribute-to-mad-skill-25-player/, congratulations to them.
