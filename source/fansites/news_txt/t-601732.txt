If you waste spend a lot of time on this site, you probably already heard about the brew fest. It seems that it will includes a rather large structure probably in capital towns ? used to serve tons of beers. Screenshot follows !

There is also a new 18 slots bag, probably introduced during the haloween oh em gee ! Broom mount !  and will more than likely be equivalent to [item=20400]


  

As I said in previous news you'll probably be able to smash kegs [spell=42393], Dark Irons will be back [spell=42448], race with rams [spell=42146], you can also see the mount here  , and of course eat sausages ! [spell=42248]. You can check the full spell list on Wowhead
