Apparently, Blizzard accidentally the whole arena season. <br>
As many of you are aware there was an issue which allowed players to reach unexpectedly high Match Making Values. While that issue has since been resolved, we&apos;re taking steps to control what occurred while it was active.<br>
<br>
<br>
All existing items requiring 2200 rating will have their minimum level requirement temporarily increased to make those items unusable. This change is currently planned to be reverted on January 25.<br>
Weapons which require a 2200 rating will be unavailable for purchase. This limitation is also planned for reversion on January 25.<br>
All player and team ratings for arenas will be reduced to a maximum of 1500. (Player, team and matchmaking ratings below 1500 will not be affected)<br>
Match Making Values for all players will be set to 1500.<br>
<br>
<br>
In addition, the &quot;best week rating&quot; will be reduced to a maximum of 1500 to match the rating change, which will in turn be used to determine next week&apos;s max weekly Conquest Points. The maximum Conquest Points given for next week will be set to 1343 to match the number that would be obtainable with a rating of 1500.<br>
<br>
<br>
Non-Crafters can no longer roll on Chaos Orbs<br>
This is a bug. A hotfix was applied about an hour ago that changes it so Chaos Orbs will only be available for Need rolls by characters with Tailoring, Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, and Engineering (minimum skill of 425 required). This fix may not appear until the next time realms are restarted, which is likely to be early tomorrow morning.<br>

Cataclysm Hotfixes - December 21<br>
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. While many have already been deployed on all realms, some may not be implemented until the next time your realm is restarted. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.<br>
