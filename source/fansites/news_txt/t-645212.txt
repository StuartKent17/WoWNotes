Boubouille2009-04-21, 08:18 PMUpdate - A video is now available, see below. Please check the Algalon the Observer  page for more details on skills and achievements.

Update - That's official, you can only fight Algalon one hour per week!!!

One hour per week. 

Update - A few important posts.
Exorcism can no longer be used on players 
Current Ulduar Issues 

Update - Algalon seems to despawn after one hour of fight. This is most likely the same mechanics as Vaelastrasz allowing raids to try it only one hour each day.
