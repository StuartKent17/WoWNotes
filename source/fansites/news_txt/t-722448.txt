Affenjungs INC vs. Halion 25 Heroic
Affenjungs Inc http://www.apeboys.org released a video of one of their attempts against Halion in 25-Man Heroic mode on PTRs. The normal mode of the encounter was already fairly impressive but it really looks like the Heroic mode will hurt.

Zalazane's Fall and Operation Gnomeregan Videos
The first part of the Cataclysm Prologue http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/cataclysm-prologue-gnomeregan-and-the-echo-isles/ is on PTRs and people who are much more useful than me released videos of both events on Youtube. Of course, you might want to avoid them if you don't like spoilers. 

The videos are Youtube playlists, just click on the next video for the 2nd part, etc ...

The MMO Report
This is probably the last time you will see the MMO Report http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/tag/3321/The-MMO-Report.html on MMO-Champion since they decided to make fun of me. I'll be waiting for a virtual hug from Casey in my mail to resume posting. 

Also, small update on the "we got hacked http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/oh-god-mmo-champion-got-hacked/" issue. After checking a few things it seems that it only affected something like 5% of the readers on the site, assuming that at least half of them had an up to date antivirus, I probably did a front page news just because 2.5% of my users got a spyware. And no, the virus didn't target WoW accounts, we just have 1M visits each day on the site and some people get randomly hacked for tons of reasons, when MMO-Champion becomes that reason you won't need me to hear about it everywhere on the forums. 

I still apologize for the screwup, even if it's not as bad as it looked in the first place.
