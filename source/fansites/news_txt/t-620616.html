The main phase of the Zombie Invasion has now started !<br>
The infection now lasts 2 minutes instead of 5<br>
Necropolis from the pre-Naxxramas events are back throughout the world ! The undeads are everywhere ! The pre-naxxramas mini-boss in Stratholme (Balzaphon) is also back and still drops his level 60 gear<br>
The quest to kill Tenris Mirkblood (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=22901.0) is now available at the Light&apos;s Hope Chapel and in most of the major cities !<br>
You cannot kite huge packs of undead anymore, they now have a debuff to reduce your speed by 50%. <br>
