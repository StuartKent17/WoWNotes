Mount Changes in 3.2
The game has gotten quite a bit longer, and allowing players to get from A to B faster only very minimally decreases difficulty; more so, it decreases time spent traveling. We don't want to discourage players from trying out the game if they have not yet, and we especially don't want to discourage existing players from trying out new characters because the leveling process from 1-80 seems too daunting after flying around Northrend grabbing purples for a while.

Whether you leveled your first character from 1-60 within a month of the game's release when the leveling curve was less forgiving, and mounts seemed like a distant dream, or you leveled a character from 1-80 in the last month with mounts a little sooner, and experience gains a little accelerated from 1-70, no one's game play experience and fun -- the reason most people would play video games in their spare time in the first place -- is at all cheapened.

Boundless Gaze is bugged Link 
No, actually the Algalon helm is bugged. We'll get it fixed. Don't shard it! Source 

 Druid 3.1 Skills List  / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. 
PvP Gloves Bonus
Yes, we are changing the older glove bonus to the new bonus. You should have -15 energy for Maim on all your PvP gloves. Source 

Innervate in Arenas
It is balanced around a 6 min cooldown so in a 3 min match it provides a lot of mana and the fact that it can't be used again for a long time is small consolation when the match is over quickly.

We are reluctant to balance it around being dispelled though. When dispel is the counter for everything, it just makes classes with the ability more necessary and makes those without it even weaker. Source 

Old models of Cat and Bear Forms
The old models for cat and bear form will go away in patch 3.2. You're welcome to hold services for the loss of these beautiful specimens at your own accord. Source 

 Rogue 3.1 Skills List  / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. 
Fan of Knives in 5v5 Arenas
So, last I looked today, rogues were represented in really low numbers in 5s among high rated teams particularly considering they are over represented in 2s and 3s. So "Mortal FoK" doesn't seem to be winning them too many matches, at least not yet, though it could be one of those things that is annoying even if not overpowered. Source
