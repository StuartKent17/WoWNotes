chaud2015-01-06, 01:33 AM10th Anniversary Event Extended One Week
The WoW Anniversary event ended a bit earlier than intended, so to make up for that lost time and any inconvenience we’re going to be re-enabling it for an additional week. The event--including the level 100 Molten Core raid--will be available again from January 6 at 10:00 a.m. PST until January 13 at 10:00 a.m. PST, for North American realms. You can see the updated event dates and times in the in-game calendar.

Look for this and other hotfixes in the 6.0.3 Hotfixes blog as it’s updated.
