holy pally doesn't get 2H-Wep with pre-patch, even though new kit and upcoming artifact are built around that?
Some artifacts such as Holy Paladin are meant to break some of the normal "rules," but aren't needed at level 100. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/755516279746801664

Battlegrounds
Please bring back the engineer glider/belt for unrated bgs. 
These will be back for unrated BGs only in a future patch. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/755825422449770496

Camera Zoom
Please don't let this issue continue to go unaddressed: https://t.co/Eu8daLDTHE & all related threads
To be clear, it's absolutely something we care deeply about. Of course we want everyone to be able to enjoy the game. But zoom... WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/755829241011404800
...distance may have been a bandaid that masked underlying causes of motion sickness. We want to identify and fix those directly. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/755829504510230529

Items
people clicking disenchant when people are greeding for offspec gear. would it not be better for a option asking if the player
Need/Greed now strictly prioritizes mainspec > offspec on Need, for reference; Greed is literally just "I want to sell this." WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/755895983209189377

UI
Hey, the low health screen flash could be a legitimate epilepsy issue. Disabling it -needs- to be put back in the menu.
The option to disable it wasn't removed! It's just been moved to the "Combat" category. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/755509502590324737

PvE
Can anyone C/D if Mists content gets the legacy buff when legion goes out? WarcraftDevs
There's no such thing as a "legacy buff" - it was a one-time adjustment to content flattened out by the 6.0 squish. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/755230416995356672
so Mists content wont get easier once I hit 110? :C
It certainly will, because you'll have several times more health and damage output after leveling and gearing up. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/755232618971475968
