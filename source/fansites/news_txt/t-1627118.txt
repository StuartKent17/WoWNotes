Warcraft Movie Presentation http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4485-Warcraft-Movie-Presentation

People actually at Blizzcon saw a short teaser trailer, but the video won't be released online https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/530887786233348096.
The movie will follow heroes on both factions, "50% Alliance, 50% Horde".
The visual effects are very realistic. Motion capture was used, the team worked with ILM to make it feel as much like live action as possible.
Effects are Avatar and Lord of the Rings at the same time.
Very detailed sets were built, such as part of Stormwind's main street.
A partial list of the cast was released.
