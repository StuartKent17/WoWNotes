Patch 6.0.3 Notes<br>
Patch 6.0.3 goes live tomorrow to fix things that cannot be hotfixed.<br>
We&#x2019;re planning to release a patch tomorrow that will bring the live game up-to-date with the version currently being tested on the beta realms. This includes a number of fixes and changes to address issues we&apos;ve identified since the release of 6.0.2, as well as remaining assets and content to prepare for the launch of Warlords of Draenor. As we&apos;ve done in prior expansions, our plan is to not require a launch-day patch, and have a smooth transition to the new expansion in North America at midnight Pacific on November 13.<br>

Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons: Trading Post Guide Updated<br>
Our Trading Post guide has been updated to reflect changes since the original post.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/tradingPostBanner.jpg (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/893-Warlords-of-Draenor-Garrisons-Trading-Post) <br>

Normal Highmaul Open for Testing<br>
The full Highmaul raid is now open on all beta realms, and will remain so for at least a couple of days. Please use this thread to provide feedback or otherwise discuss the raid content. At this stage, the most helpful type of feedback will be (of course) bug reports and tuning issues. In terms of tuning targets, there should be a steady increase in difficulty as you go from Kargath, to Twin Ogron, to Ko&apos;ragh, and finally to Imperator Mar&apos;gok. The other three optional bosses should be scattered in the middle of that difficulty spectrum. And, of course, this is Normal mode so the target audience is friends-and-family raiding groups, with pickup groups having increasing success as gear and knowledge of the fights spreads through the community.<br>

Candy Buckets in Old Blasted Lands<br>
Tagging this with blue for anyone asking how to get the candy buckets in Blasted Lands now.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
On the border of Blasted Lands and Swamp of Sorrows, there&apos;s an NPC named Zidormi who will phase Blasted Lands to the old one if you need it. She can also phase it back to the current version when you&apos;re ready.

Arthas Costume Price<br>
180+60+256+10 = 506.<br>
<br>
Even if you get the absolute minimum possible, you still have enough for the costume. Assuming it&apos;s a simple coinflip for the Handful of Treats determination (50% chance of getting 2, 50% chance of getting 3), the odds of you getting the absolute minimum is <br>
<br>
1 out of 11,150,372,599,265,311,570,767,859,136,324,180,752,990,208.<br>
<br>
This isn&apos;t even counting the odds of you getting the absolute minimum from the Horseman too!<br>
This is accurate (well I don&apos;t know if those odds are accurate or not, but the drops are). Even with the worst possible drops every single day you would end with 506.

Why is poisoned arrow scaling with AP while Incendiary/Frozen arrows scale with weapon damage ?<br>
Fits the effect. Using weapon damage when the weapon isn&apos;t hitting is quite weird. Bleeds, Poisons, etc, are always AP-based. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/525218878578638850))<br>
