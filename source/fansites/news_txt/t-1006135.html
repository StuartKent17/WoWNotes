Theramore to be destroyed by the Horde in 5.0?<br>
It seems that Theramore will be destroyed by the Horde in the pre-Mists of Pandaria world events, the info was revealed to a couple of taiwanese websites attending a press event with Tom Chilton. Translation from Curll on ScrollsOfLore (http://www.scrollsoflore.com/forums/showpost.php?p=368927&amp;postcount=43).<br>

Here&apos;s the original quote. Let me translate:<br>
The whole war will be ignited during the world event which leading the game into Mist of Pandaria. Theramore will be destroyed and the leaders of Alliance were outrageous at this matter and completely devote themselves into the war, which reach its peak on the continent of Pandaria. The Horde and the Alliance literally fought on the homeland of Pandaria, which pissed the pandarens off.<br>

Most of the pandarens are neutral characters. And some of them thought the Horde and the Alliance only brought doom to their beloved homeland, and have enmity against both factions. The players pandarens are in a different group. They departed Pandaria long ago and choose their own path. They choose their own faction when level 10, so they don&apos;t have a faction leader.<br>

This is a pretty good deal for anyone playing WoW, especially since the time between the last patch of Cataclysm and the beginning of Mists of Pandaria will probably much shorter than it was for WotLK/Cataclysm. <br>
