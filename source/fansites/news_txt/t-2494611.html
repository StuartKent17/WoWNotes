Mike Morhaime Interviews - Project Titan and Starcraft Ghost<br>
Mike Morhaime, co-founder and former President of Blizzard Entertainment, has been discussing his time at Blizzard in a series of recent interviews (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2494031-Crossroads-Cinematic-Essence-VFX-Mike-Morhaime-Interviews). Most recently, he talked with VG247 (https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/26/world-warcraft-sequel-titan-canned-blizzard-failed-control-scope/) about the canceled MMO project, code-named Titan. <br>
<br>
<br>
Titan was canceled because Blizzard failed to control the scope of the project. <br>
They looked at Titan as a sequel to World of Warcraft, a next-generation MMO. <br>
Many of their senior developers were put on project Titan. <br>
The game was very ambitious taking place in a universe focused on hystorical myth, with time travel mechanics. <br>
Titan would have been a subscription-based MMO had it been released. <br>
The engine for the game never reached the level of where it needed to be, and the developer staff said it wasn&apos;t working.<br>
They asked the team to come up with one or two ideas they could focus on, it could be anything they wanted. <br>
Overwatch was the result of the Titan team&apos;s brainstorming and became the focus of their team.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mike Morhaime also discussed the cancellation of Starcraft Ghost (https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/27/starcraft-ghost-cancelled-blizzard-game-co-founder-mike-morhaime-regrets/), what would have been a 3rd person action game set in the Starcraft universe.<br>
<br>
<br>
Blizzard felt Starcraft Ghost couldn&apos;t be successful because of limited resources. <br>
During Starcraft Ghost development, World of Warcraft was exploding while Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2 were in development.<br>
The team had to make tough choices on where to place its talent, and there weren&apos;t enough resources to go around. <br>
With Starcraft Ghost canceled, they could focus on injecting all their talent into other products.<br>
