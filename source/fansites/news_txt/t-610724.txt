Boubouille2008-07-28, 08:54 AMUpdate - To prevent any confusion, all the changes to mana cost from % of base mana to a fixed mana value have been removed from the class changes, also, warlock changes have been updated. 


WotLK Token System
Among other things, a new token storage system http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8202616153&pageNo=1&sid=2000#4 is being added to the game to prevent excessive amount of items in bags. The token window is already visible in game by typing /console showtokenframe 1 and /token.

WotLK - Boss Preview
I didn't want to post that in the first place because the following screenshots are a HUGE spoiler and people might not want to look at them but well ... I guess you wouldn't read this site if you cared about spoilers in the first place. Every once in a while we will do previews of monsters you can find in upcoming instances, there are ways to do that and I'm sure you will be happy to learn a few things about your enemies.
Even if the data was collected from official servers, these screenshots had to be taken on a less official server.
We're 110% sure that monsters do look like this on official server at this time, however keep in mind that we're still in beta and a lot of models are getting changed all the time. Bosses aren't an exception and a few models are already flagged as PH =Placeholder and will probably be changed in an upcoming build.
To prevent any confusion with official servers and protect their privacy, all monsters were moved to the Twilight Grove for the pictures. 



Today, we'll start with the bosses and a few supposed trash mobs from The Oculus, followed by a few screenshots of some of the rideable drakes.

I'm not sure if it made the talent trees, but we changed Frost Strike to be an instant attack with no chance to Freeze but bonus damage vs frozen targets. Use Chains or get a random freeze and then use Icy Touch if talented or Howling Blast at range or Frost Strike in mel√©e.

I wanted to clear this up since it is understandably causing some confusion. All pet tiers cost 3 points to advance. There are no talents that cost 5 points. In the beta some tooltips may say 5 but only 3 is enforced. Most importantly this means that there are not talents that are available only to BM hunters. They can get more talents - that's all. Furthemore, the exotic pet abilities while interesting are just the same kind of unique abilities that every pet family gets, like web or prowl.

WotLK - Upcoming Beta Classes Changes V2
The official talent calculator http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/talent-index/wrath.html has been updated with what seems to be the upcoming changes to the Wrath of the Lich King beta. Below is a list of changes we might have missed a few things

We posted a first draft of these changes a few days ago but an updated version feels necessary because of a few details :
According to feedbacks, Ice Lance not being mentioned in the Arctic Reach tooltip was a known bug and it might not have been changed. 
The mana cost of Druids forms might have not been changed, official site doesn't seem to support % of base mana for spell costs and even on the BC Talent Calculator http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/druid/talents.html, the fixed value of mana is here. Please stop reporting changes to mana costs for all the classes especially Warlocks or Priests, this is most likely a bug. 
Death Knight Frost Tree changes from saturday have been added to the list.
