<br>
2.4 Testing soon ?<br>
European PTR forums have been cleaned yesterday and most of the US community managers have been very quiet, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if we had some decent 2.4 details released today, or even the PTR itself.<br>
To keep this forum relevant to the current or upcoming version on the PTRs, all old threads have been removed. This will be done soon after each patch test cycle is completed and the patch is applied to the regular realms.<br>
<br>
Informational sticky threads will be reposted after each forum wipe, and as new information about the current or upcoming patch becomes available it will be added in this forum. <br>
<br>
(Note : Thundgot also posted a small post about the Blizzard Feedback Tool (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=2405445944&amp;sid=1) on PTRs)<br>
And hopefully it will be the last time I link : <br>
The good old 2.4 compilation post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=3199.0).<br>
The Sunwell loots (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=3792.0) posted a few days ago.<br>

You get to keep your Mojo !<br>
If you managed to get a Mojo by /kissing the troll next to Zul&apos;aman before the &quot;bug&quot; was fixed yesterday, you shouldn&apos;t be worried about seeing it disappear.<br>
Mojo wasn&apos;t intended to be obtained for a kiss outside of Zul&apos;Aman. You will need to get a hex stick and try your luck on the frogs inside Zul&apos;Aman.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, those who have managed to acquire Mojo will be able to keep him. Yes, you get to keep your Mojo. <br>

<br>
US Realms - Extended maintenance<br>
US Realms are getting an extended maintenance today, probably because of the crashes affecting most of the realms during the weekend.<br>
We will be performing extended maintenance for all realms on Tuesday, January 29. The downtime will begin at 3:00 AM PST and end at approximately 11:00 AM PST.<br>

2.3.3 Known Issues list<br>
Hortus updated his old 2.3.2 known issues post and changed it into a 2.3.3 post, as usual keep in mind that this is a list of bugs still affecting the game in 2.3.3, some of them were already here before and the patch didn&apos;t add all of them. I removed the Items, Tradeskills, and UI part because it was already really big, you can read them on the official forums (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3773464619&amp;sid=1)<br>
