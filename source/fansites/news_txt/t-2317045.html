World of Warcraft Sargeras Shirt<br>
The shirt description (https://gear.blizzard.com/us/blizzcon/world-of-warcraft-sargeras-shirt-men-s) potentially explains the wound added to a map in Patch 7.3.2. Check out the shirt description for spoilers!<br>

World of Warcraft Raptor Plushie<br>
This raptor (https://gear.blizzard.com/us/blizzcon/world-of-warcraft-raptor-plushie) doesn&apos;t spoil anything in its description, but an interesting raptor mount was recently added in Patch 7.3.2. The ArmoredRaptor mount is still encrypted, so we don&apos;t know what it will look like. A new creature was also added that uses hoofprints and existing horse sounds in Patch 7.3.2, but the model is encrypted with the same key as the ArmoredRaptor. You can also pick up a Elekk plushie (https://gear.blizzard.com/us/blizzcon/world-of-warcraft-elekk-plushie)! <br>
