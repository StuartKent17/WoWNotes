Boubouille2009-06-01, 01:18 PMThe week starts slowly with an update to the ulduar loot pages and new comics. Depending on Blizzard's plans we might see Patch 3.1.3 http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=58856.0 deployed on live servers this week and druids will get a 2nd preview of the Updated Druid Forms http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=59051.0. Stay tuned! 

Ulduar Loot List Update
Better late than never, right? The Ulduar 25-Man Loot List http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=862#loot25 and Ulduar 10-Man Loot List http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=862#loot10 have been updated with all the latest loot discovered on live servers. There are probably a few bugs left but it should be much more reliable than before.
