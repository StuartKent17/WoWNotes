chaud2018-08-21, 09:23 PMUpcoming Feral Druid Tuning
We're currently working through a tuning package for Feral Druids.

Specifically, we're adjusting Feral performance relative to other specs in dungeons and questing. Please know: we've been reading all of the incoming feedback and keeping a close eye on player results in-game.

Thank you for all of this feedback. Much of it has been very useful in determining the substance of this adjustment.

This is something that we're testing carefully, and probably won't be finished and available to put into the live game until later this week. I'll let you know as soon as we have final numbers, and I'll post about it a final time when it goes live.


Bounty Bag Rewards
The bounty bag loot drops diminish after 1 bag looted per day. This is to prevent abuse of the system.
