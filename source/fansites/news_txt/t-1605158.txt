Justice and Valor Conversion
I understand Valor and Justice will be gotten rid of, so will their be a gold conversion with any left over or should we spend it all instead?
The gold conversion for Justice and Valor Points will be made at 47 silver per point.


Patch 6.0.2 - Wrath of the Lich King Commendation Badges Removed
It looks like the Commendation Badges http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Commendation+Badge&filter-source=6144 from Wrath of the Lich King are also going away, so be sure to buy them soon if you want to level up those reputations. You can see all of the things going away in Patch 6.0.2 in our recap http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4315-Patch-6-0-Reminders-Warlords-of-Draenor-Healing-Blue-Tweets-DLC-457.
