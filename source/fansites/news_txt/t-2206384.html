Pose with the Blues - April 21<br>
Join us tomorrow (Friday, April 21) on the Public Test Realms and show us your moves in the Trial of Style!<br>
<br>
From 2 to 4 PM Pacific time (5 to 7 PM Eastern), we&#x2019;ll be donning our best outfits and strutting our stuff in the brand new Trial of Style event, which is coming in patch 7.2.5. If you&#x2019;re able to stop by, we&#x2019;d love for you to join us! Just download the PTR, copy your character, and find Flaskataur in Stormwind or Orgrimmar. He&#x2019;ll have an option to queue for &#x201C;Mog Week Tournament&quot; &#x2013; select that, and you&#x2019;re off!<br>
<br>
Note: due to the way PTR character copies work, you&#x2019;ll most likely be missing some appearances on the PTR that you&#x2019;ve unlocked on live realms. As the saying goes, &#x201C;Make it work!&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Of course, we&#x2019;ll be participating as well. You&#x2019;ll know you&#x2019;re flexing for a Blizzard employee when you see someone in either the &lt;Blizzard Alliance&gt; or &lt;Blizzard Horde&gt; guilds.<br>
<br>
See you then!<br>

Anduin&apos;s Questline - Where&apos;s the Horde Part?<br>
The Anduin quest-line and cinematic is intended to tie together the loose ends with the leadership of the Alliance following the events of the Broken Shore in 7.0.<br>
<br>
It&apos;s aimed to be similar in nature to the second cinematic Horde players saw following the 7.0 introduction quests which solidified Sylvanas as the new Warchief of the Horde.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re forwarding on the feedback that Horde players are unhappy that Alliance players have a one time source of additional Artifact Power. Thanks for the feedback.

Affliction MG Changes - Some Transparency?<br>
We hear you all on Soul Effigy. We&#x2019;re going to remove it in the next PTR patch. It&#x2019;s concerning when the community sentiment towards a talent isn&#x2019;t that it&#x2019;s overpowered or underpowered, but that everyone is terrified they&#x2019;re going to have to play that way if it becomes strong.<br>
<br>
It should be understandable how the original concept of Soul Effigy would seem fun in theory, despite it clearly not working out in practice. As an Affliction Warlock, I&apos;m very happy to walk into a 2-target boss fight. At a basic level, you know you&apos;re going to get double value out of your DoTs. Walking into a 1-target fight with Soul Effigy just doesn&apos;t feel nearly the same. Mechanically, the gameplay of the two situations is very similar, but in the end Soul Effigy doesn&apos;t play out well. Could be any of a number of actors - the reduced damage transfer, feeling like the effigy is just there for increased soul shard generation, the usability issues, or the unnaturalness of it as a concept. <br>
<br>
Anyways, it&#x2019;s gone. Replacement talent to come.<br>
Thanks for the comment Seph, can you clarify whether Affliction will be receiving the nerf to Soul Conduit or not? The notes said only demo was excluded from the SC nerf however on PTR the talent remains 20% for Aff (the tooltip at least, I have not tested the actual %).<br>
Soul Conduit should be unchanged for Affliction. Latest patch notes should reflect that.<br>
<br>
This is also further compounded by our current T20 set bonus, which puts a lot of emphasis on drain damage and complete drains - both of which are part of the MG play style, which was just effectively neutered.<br>
The Tier 20 set bonus for Affliction is changing soon. It won&#x2019;t be so focused on Drain Soul. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1058954-affliction-mg-changes-some-transparency/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20754325347?page=8#154))<br>
