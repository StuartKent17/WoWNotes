Developer Interview - Battle for Azeroth
Forbes https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2018/06/25/world-of-warcraft-game-director-talks-mythic-plus-azerite-drops-and-discord/#78bcf49a7864 posted part one of its two part interview earlier with Game Director Ion Hazzikostas about mythic plus, Azerite drops and more in Battle for Azeroth.


Mythic Plus dungeons are designed and balanced with the idea that you can't swap gear during a run in Battle for Azeroth.
Once you get past Normal and Heroic dungeons, sources of Azerite armor aren't infinitely repeatable. 
You can get Azerite Armor from an emissary cache, but not from a random world quest.
You can get Azerite Armor from your weekly PvP reward, weekly Mythic+ reward, or from the Conquest system, but not just at the end of a match or Mythic+ dungeon.
As it stands now, Mythic+ quality Azerite gear from your weekly cache will be associated with thresholds where new affixes are added 4, 7, 10. The level of Mythic+ completed in the week will determine which threshold of Azerite Armor you could get.
As the expansion progresses, the ceiling of Mythic+ rewards will probably move from 10 to 15 much like in Legion. 10 will likely be harder in the beginning of the expansion as people learn the new dungeons.
The team is trying to think how to better implement new dungeons to Mythic+ over the course of the expansion so issues like Seat of the Triumvirate being a harder/unpopular key doesn't happen.
The team aims to have BfA dungeons retain the same difficulty of Legion dungeons. 
The team keeps affixes like Teeming and Bolstering in mind when designing the BfA dungeons.
The 200 friend limit is a Battle.net limitation and the feedback asking to increase it has been heard, but communities should help in the meantime.
The team looks at current chat systems when designing their own. Classic WoW was influenced by AOL Instant Messenger and others.
Adding in game features like in-game voice chat is more of a convenience and not trying to compete with outside programs like Discord. 
In-game voice chat helps when doing world quests or other group content where you don't necessarily want to send Discord info or other chat program information.
