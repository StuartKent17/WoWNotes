A new build is being deployed to Public Test Realms and WotLK Beta Servers. Just like all the time all the changes will be posted when the patch is available, stay tuned !<br>
The PTRs will be going down for maintenance and updating tonight at 6 pm PST. During this time you will be unable to log into our game servers. The servers are expected to be down for approximately 6 hours. <br>
<br>
The Beta realms will also be down and updated to the same version as the PTR.</div></div>
