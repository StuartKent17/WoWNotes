Intervene no longer removes movement-impairing effects on use. The talent Safeguard will continue to remove movement-impairing effects.




Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios

Cross-Realm raid browser now has new categories for Mists of Pandaria World Bosses Celestials and Ordos and Flexible raid difficulty for Siege of Orgrimmar.

The cross-realm raid browser is accessed through the 'Social Pane' bound to the O key by default and look for the 'Raid' tab on the bottom right.
From there you can set the character as looking to join a raid or browse players that are forming up for a raid.
For more information on this change, please see the thread titled Cross-Realm Raid Browser on the PTR Discussion forum.

Players are now able to place raid markers in the world even while dead.


Items

Players are now able to mail account-bound items to other characters that reside on a different realm on the same account. To send cross-realm mail: enter the character's name, followed by a hyphen "-", followed by the realm name. Note that cross-realm mail can only send account-bound items, not other items or gold.

Additional information and testing discussion for this cross-realm mail can be found in this thread on the PTR Discussion forum.



UI

The Customer Support button has moved. Customer support can now be reached in-game by selecting Help option through the Game Menu Game Menu is bound to the Escape key by default.

Developer Communication
We try to communicate as much as we can. I can't speak for every CM as we all have different duties around the office which can often take us away from the forums a bit, but conversing on the forums has been a personal priority of mine since I started here. I spend a large chunk of my day reading and replying when I feel I have something meaningful to add. I also collect a ton of feedback to bring directly to the developers for discussion.

I totally get the concerns about losing Ghostcrawler from Twitter. He's been one of the most candid and open developers in the gaming industry as a whole for a long time. Fortunately, he's not only developer responding regularly on Twitter! We actually have a list in one of the stickies on this forum with Twitter handles of several top developers. Generally speaking, any question you would previously have sent to Ghostcrawler, someone else on that list will be able to answer. The Community team's Twitter handles are listed in there as well.

Greg will no longer be working with us here at Blizzard, but we're not going to let that be a stopping point to our interaction with the community. We're here for you guys.

Are you serious? You actually think what you say and them saying "oh we'll look into it" matters at all? Here's a quote from Holinka an hour ago 
While I acknowledge that tweet could have been phrased better, that was an out of context response to a conversation. I won't presume to speak for Brian, but according to my interpretation and within the context of that conversation, I think what he's trying to get across within the limitations of Twitter is that we make changes based on a perceived need, not merely because a volume of ideas for changes exist.

We say 'we'll look into it' all the time. I've said it many times myself, on a variety of topics, and it does alert us to situations where a change or adjustment is merited. If you don't believe that what the community has to say has an impact? Well, evidence of the opposite is all around you.

Making 90s out of those of my numerous alts who aren't there yet. 11th one last Saturday; 12th one "soon" 
I plan to use my boost to play with opposite faction pals on a realm where my leveled characters are all one faction. Lookin' forward to it! Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Warlords of Draenor Items
The new item system stats prop. for your spec will affect all items neck, ring... or just the set chest, helm..?
Only the main armor pieces head etc. will swap primary stats. That is true of tier sets and off-piece items. Source 
Jewelry etc. likely won't ever have primary stats. They may have attack power, but mostly secondary stats. Source 

This isnt going to help as much as you think, just make things more annoying for players.
We feel acquiring BiS quickly only feels good for the short term. Long term it has little staying power. Source 
Imagine killing Immerseus 16 times and sharding everything while you're still farming Garrosh. Source 
Then imagine every Immerseus kill you still pay attention to loot because something cool or amazing could drop. Source 

Not sure how this erases the issues spec-based primary stats were supposed to fix. Why not spirit/armor on primary?
Because then you can't choose how much you want. You just get what we give you. Source 
That's the design for primaries to keep them growing with ilevel. Secondaries are about what stats you like. Source 
If you heal, you may want Spirit on every non-armor spot or not. You may find those pieces or not. Source 

RE: removing hit/exp - does that mean all attacks 100% hit? Or is there a baseline miss chance we can no longer negate?
Imagine you capped yellow attacks, which is typical today. Melee might miss from the front or with an OH attack. Source 
I don't like removing them for two reasons. 1 historical. Craps on combat table. 2 I have 3 stats left. Yawn?
Hopefully not 3 stats... Source 

with reforge gone how are we going to deal with haste break points? Just curious
Our dot/hot changes mean fewer haste break points. Usually more haste is still valuable after break, just less valuable than before Source 


Addon Update - WeakAuras 2
There is an exploit that causes players to give away their gold via a malicious WeakAuras script being imported. To protect yourself, please update your copy of WeakAuras to the latest version, which protects against some attacks. Also avoid importing any scripts from untrustworthy sources, as attacks are still possible.
