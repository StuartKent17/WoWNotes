Diablo 3's next expansion is named "Reaper of Souls"?
Well we can definitely say the past few hours have been interesting. After uncovering the trademarking of The Dark Below  yesterday, it looks like the teaser for the next Diablo 3 expansion just went live. 


 

According to the official website  "Reaper of Souls" is a trademark and linked to Diablo 3, with Gamescom coming up next week it wouldn't be surprising to see the expansion for Diablo 3 announced there.

More importantly, it rules out The Dark Below as the next Diablo 3 expansion and makes things a lot more interesting suddenly.
