Diablo 3's next expansion is named "Reaper of Souls"?
Well we can definitely say the past few hours have been interesting. After uncovering the trademarking of The Dark Below http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3339-Blizzard-Trademarks-The-Dark-Below-WoW-or-D3-Expansion yesterday, it looks like the teaser for the next Diablo 3 expansion just went live.

According to the official website http://us.battle.net/d3/en/reaper-of-souls/ "Reaper of Souls" is a trademark and linked to Diablo 3, with Gamescom coming up next week it wouldn't be surprising to see the expansion for Diablo 3 announced there.

More importantly, it rules out The Dark Below as the next Diablo 3 expansion and makes things a lot more interesting suddenly.
