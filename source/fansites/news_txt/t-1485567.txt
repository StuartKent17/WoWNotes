WoW Source Returns! Have Questions?
Another WoW Source is on its way, and once again we’re looking for your questions. This time around we’re planning to feature Lead Class Designer Kris Zierhut, Lead Encounter Designer Ion Hazzikostas, and Senior Game Designer Brian Holinka, along with host Morgan Webb. This time the interview will be geared towards discussing class and PvP changes coming in Warlords of Draenor. Just like last time, post questions you have for the developers in this thread, and feel free to use the “thumbs-up” Like button to let us know if you’d like to see someone else’s question answered.

Your post may be featured on the next episode!


Blue Tweets
Classes
What is the diff between glyphs and talents? They seem to accomplish the same thing mod spells on a different UI panel.
Talents are more transformative and strictly increase your power. Glyphs offer lateral customization and cosmetics Minors. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445233889766686723

PvE
There needs to be a feature to be able to blacklist 1-2 random dungeons just like blacklisting random bg's
Which ones would you blacklist? WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445218592523436032

Make fire/acid/void zones really punish DPS by debuffing their damage output. Healers would love if you did this.
In LFR, that'd punish everyone by making the fight longer if DPS were unaware; healers can at least compensate currently. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445212085052387328

I'm not sure if you have answered this, but I was curious how many healers a mythic group should expect to have on hand for WoD?
Likely 5 on average. Aiming to avoid some of the under/overhealing extremes we saw in the last portion of SoO. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445234954817912832

Is there a magic number for tanks in mythic raids? 2 or 3? Would like to know cause of planning our roster
Generally 2. You'll probably be well served by having a third player who has a tank spec, but doesn't expect to always tank. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443401034581286913
Is that for fights that have 3 hard-hitting targets, or so you can swap to a "more ideal" tank class/spec for a fight?
The former. We're not going out of our way to make 3-tank fights, but we're less constrained when it'd add to the design. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443473661790416896

This is a big issue. Going from 7-8 healers to 4-5 and vice versa is hard. Would like more consistency.
I'd say 4-6, 5 average for Mythic. We're going to try to avoid 3 or 7 ever feeling like the right answer. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443789698050179072

When you design a fight, what comes first, the boss or the mechanics? Like was the "miasma fight" always going to be Malkorok?
Usually the boss; occasionally the mechanic. With Malkorok we just knew he was a Y'Shaarj-corrupted orc soldier and went from there WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/444644111375544321

PvP
No spoilers cap'n PVP but how's Ashran going? Looking good on the pvp front?
We are iterating on the design a lot. Really trying to nail a rewarding, persistent sandbox zone focused on PvP. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/444984547273240576

do you consider making pvp gemsesp.resiliencea more viable option? would love being able to change that more situational #scaling
Don't feel like gemming is the right medium for situational choices. Glyphs and talents fit that niche better. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/444992506627756032

in all the other regions th PvP action is 90% horde,15m queue times are ruining the game for most casual
The worst region has 55% horde queuing for bgs vs 45% alliance. This is queue data not realm data. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443824979314884608
funny how that doesnt match players experience with queue times, including mine, ohh well :P
or that's the amount of imbalance that's causes these queue times. Not denying queue time problem. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443841505447256064

pvp scene in EU is 90% alliance. You're heavily nerfing horde racials and buffing ally racials. How do you think that'll pan out?
EU BG queues have a very close ratio. Not concerned. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/445244537590390784
The high end scene is going to pick one side or the other and flock there. Mostly concerned with battle ground queue times. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/445246284014710784

Lore
Are the embodied spirits in the Fallen Protectors fight dead, or just memories of the bosses' allies?
The sha unleashed when Garrosh ruined the Vale claimed many victims, including those charged with protecting the Vale. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443931327234965504
But some of the Embodied adds in that fight are still alive, like Ren Firetongue.
Ah, I didn't catch that you meant the ones summoned by Desperate Measures. Those are projections of negative emotion. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443933581232971776

Warlords of Draenor
When MoP challenge modes are gone, will those reward skins ever be obtainable again?
People who got 9 Golds will be able to re-purchase from the vendor if needed. Otherwise, not planning on it. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445212351147433984


Poll - Dungeon Blacklist
This set of Blue Tweets had Watcher asking https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445218592523436032 which dungeon you would blacklist if you could. A similar poll popped up on the forum http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1477751-Which-5-man-dungeon-would-you-have-blacklisted recently, where people also shared the reason why they would blacklist certain dungeons.
