WoW Classic Demo Playtime Limit and Cooldown
Playing the Classic Demo
When the World of Warcraft: Classic demo becomes available to play at home on Friday, November 2, we will ensure maximum availability to players at home by initially establishing session limits.

When the demo goes live, we’ll use a playtime time limit and a cooldown that starts when you first log in to help as many people as possible play the Classic demo as much as possible. We’ll start with a playtime limit of a cumulative 60 minutes and a cooldown of 90 minutes. Here are some examples of how that might work:


If you play for 30 minutes and then log off for 60 minutes, when you come back you’ll have a fresh 60 minutes.
If you play for 60 minutes, you’ll be disconnected and then have to wait 30 minutes before you can play again.
If you play for 20 minutes, log off for 20 minutes, then play 40 more minutes, you’ll be logged off and wait 10 more minutes.

Our goal is to lift session limits as quickly as we feasibly can after the demo goes live. We will then only reinstate session limits if unexpectedly high demand returns.

We will update this post with further information on this, as necessary.

Thank you!
