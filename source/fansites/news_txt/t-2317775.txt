Raid Testing Schedule - October 11th - 18th
On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, October 11th-13th we will be conducting raid tests of Antorus, the Burning Throne. If testing goes well, the majority of Normal mode will remain available over the weekend.

Thursday, October 12th

Kin'garoth - Mythic Antorus, the Burning Throne
13:00 PDT 16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST

The Coven of Shivarra - Mythic Antorus, the Burning Throne
14:00 PDT 17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST

Friday, October 13th

Antoran High Command - Heroic Antorus, the Burning Throne
13:00 PDT 16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST

Argus the Unmaker - Heroic Antorus, the Burning Throne
14:00 PDT 17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST

Friday, October 13th - Wednesday, October 18th
Normal Antorus, the Burning Throne

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.

Q: How do I get into the raid zone?

A: In Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade Sr. in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.

I assume are all normal bosses up Friday, October 13th - Wednesday, October 18th? Including argus?
Argus the Unmaker will not be included in the Normal mode test. All other bosses will be available.


Patch 7.3 Hotfixes - October 10
Argus

Fixed an issue where bonus rolls would fail to occur when defeating some Greater Invasion Point bosses.
Fixed an issue on Mac'Aree where players were being sent to graveyards incorrect graveyards.


Dungeons and Raids

Artifact Appearances After Legion
I just posted this in another thread, but I'll mention it again here:

Any artifact appearances you've unlocked including Druid forms will be available as transmogrification options after Legion. I'm not privy to the specifics on how it will work regarding Druid forms, but the developers are keen to make sure you can still use those forms after Legion.

You'll also still be able to acquire appearances you haven't earned post-Legion, with the only exceptions being the Mythic 15 Keystone Dungeon appearance, and the Mage Tower appearances. If you don't earn those before the end of Legion, you won't be able to earn them after Legion - think of them as effectively the Challenge Mode sets of Legion.

Hope this clarifies.

only to make sure: when legion ends we can use our artifact skins as transmog weapons, but only for the class? i mean i cant use thunderfury on another class am i right?
Right now I believe the current intent is that artifact weapon appearances can only be transmogged on the class the artifact was for. So to use an earlier example, Death Knight's wouldn't be able to transmog the Corrupted Ashbringer appearance from a Paladin.

I've forwarded on the other questions in this thread so if I get any more specific details I can share, I'll let you know.

Morning! I've got a few updates to share.

Regarding the Mage Tower appearance. If you unlock your Mage Tower appearance before Legion is over, you will still be able to earn the colour variants of it post-Legion.

Likewise the colour variants of the Balance of Power appearance will still be obtainable post-Legion, with the exception of the Mythic +15 variant which needs to be obtained before Legion ends.

Prestige appearances will still be obtainable after Legion, though the exact manner in which they are earned may change. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Retribution Paladin Balance
Retribution Paladins are nowhere near the bottom, and, like others have pointed out, that data is misleading considering there are quite a few bosses that allow us to cleave. 

Currently I still see that if I have more than one target I know Divine Storm overpowers Templar's Verdict and I'm free to cleave like a madman. Retribution Paladins shine on movement and cleave which ToS is definitely a lot more friendly to us. 

Of course I wouldn't object to buffswho wouldn't but I don't feel like we need them at the moment. This could change with our T21 set bonuses considering we'd be losing the T20 4 set that interacts so well with our talents and Crusade, however in the current state I think Ret Paladins are quite fine and pretty formidable among melee.

I can't say I agree with you here. Movement is quite punishing for Ret outside of Steed. Divine Steed off GCD would be amazing right now.
True, Divine Steed coming off GCD would be nice change. However, having the option to switch to Cavalier I feel fills that need for me when I do want the additional mobility. Cavalier plus our Blessings fills any need of mobility I've encountered this tier. 

With the T20 4p going away some buffs would be nice. The 4p even feels like it's made to be baseline since it makes the spec feel much more fluid. Spending that one extra GCD is annoying when you need aoe. I would like to see T21 changed though.
I agree here as well. I've become very used to the T20 four-piece and it feels very baseline to me at this point. It's going to take some getting used to for me moving away from it if that isn't changed to a baseline. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
