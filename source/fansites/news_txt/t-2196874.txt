Legion Assaults
Legion Assaults will go live later today https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/849322657657106432! You will need to earn Defender of the Broken Isles http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11544-defender-of-the-broken-isles for Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Two http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11446-broken-isles-pathfinder-part-two.


The invasion begins with a zone being under attack. The skybox, world quests, and the NPCs present are changed in some areas, similar to the pre-expansion invasions. 
The invasion quests are similar to the regular world quests, requiring you to kill NPCs and click objects.
After completing all six invasion world quests, you have completed the Assault on Zone quest http://www.wowdb.com/quests?filter-patch=23436&filter-daily=1&filter-search=Assault, allowing you to move to the next stage.
Next you are sent to a specific point in the zone to defeat more invaders, with some similar followup quests.
After all of these quests are complete, there is a three player invasion scenario that sends you to the Legion ship in the sky.
On the ship you defeat various NPCs before defeating the leader and taking down the ship.
