World of Warcraft Magazine Canceled<br>
Blizzard just sent a mail to all the subscribers of the World of Warcraft magazine. If you subscribed to the magazine, you can either ask for your money back or get a package of 6 companion pets in game, you might want to look into it now since you apparently only have 2 weeks to do so. <br>

To redeem your premium or request a refund, please visit www.worldofwarcraftthemagazine.com by September 30, 2011.<br>

<br>
With thanks,<br>
Future US and Blizzard Entertainment<br>

Blue PostsTier 13<br>
[...] Most of this tier was attempting to play off a new ability the class got in Cataclysm, so for instance Time Warp for mages and Wild Mushroom for druid, in some cases (like warrior or warlock) there&apos;s playing off of the raid and those themes, and then for others it&apos;s a bit more just doing something we think represents the class in a more abstract manner. We&apos;re putting them up as soon as they&apos;re done, essentially, so from here on out they&apos;re likely to be posted rather randomly.

<br>
Wind Shear<br>
It&apos;s still a part of the plan and you&apos;ll find out more information once we get into discussing patch 4.3 class balance. I&apos;m not really able to reveal any plans as of yet. Without any context the information I could provide would only lead to a slew of follow-up questions, which will be answered better in our upcoming announcements.

Tier 13 and Future Armor Art<br>
There is only one objective truth about every single armor set we&apos;ve ever made -- some people love, and some people hate, each of &apos;em. The art is completely subjective and your tastes reflect your viewpoint.<br>
<br>
That said, our design philosophy for epic sets is not changing at all with the introduction of Transmogrification. We&apos;re still going to keep designing what we think is fitting and awesome for each class and tier. We want people to want to wear all of the major armor sets we release. In the future you&apos;ll just have the option of deciding what set fits you best aesthetically and adventuring to obtain it, without worrying about the stats.

Paypal and Diablo III Auction House<br>
We&apos;re pleased to announce that in most regions, PayPal will be our payment-service partner for the Diablo III auction house, allowing players who trade with real-world currency the ability to cash out the spoils of their battle-torn adventures via a PayPal account.<br>
<br>
PayPal will also soon be added in several regions as a payment option on Battle.net, providing another convenient and secure payment method for digital purchases of Blizzard products and services.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll share region-related specifics, as well as further details on everything mentioned above, in the near future. Stay tuned!
