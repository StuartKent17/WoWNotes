<br>
Curse (http://www.curse-guild.org) is currently fighting Illidan, and are progressing through the phases quite well it seems. <br>
How would I know ? Earlier tonight, I tried to query the itemID of the Twin Blade main hand on Vek&apos;nilash, where Curse plays, it didn&apos;t work.<br>
Few minutes ago, I tried again ... and here you go. Twin Blades of Azzinoth !<br>

<br>
We can now fairly assume that the item is needed by NPCs on the encounter, which means we won&apos;t get the stats of the off-hand anytime soon. <br>
The stats on this one are real, because the itemID is the same as the one used in the player set (included in the game files).</div></div>
