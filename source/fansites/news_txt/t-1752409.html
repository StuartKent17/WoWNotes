WoW Token Releases April 7 in the US - $20 or 30k Gold<br>
The WoW Token (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122270-wow-token) is finally here this week!<br>
<br>
<br>
You can purchase the WoW Token (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122270-wow-token) with gold without an active Subscription (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/april/wowTokenInactive.jpg).<br>
The gold price for tokens is set by Blizzard based on supply and demand, not by players.<br>
Purchasing a WoW Token (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122270-wow-token) from the AH makes it Soulbound - it cannot be resold.<br>
The Token grants 30 days of game time.<br>
You can only buy 10 Tokens each month.<br>
Tokens listings are region wide and are not limited to just your realm.<br>
<br>
<br>
Update: The WoW Token will be going live in the Americas region (North America, Latin America, Australia, and New Zealand) on April 7 when maintenance concludes, at approximately 10 a.m. PDT. The WoW Token will be available for $20 USD/$25 AUD from the in-game Shop, and will be set at a starting price of 30,000 gold in the Auction House across the Americas region. From that point forward, the gold price will automatically fluctuate based on player supply and demand. To start we&#x2019;ll be limiting the number of Token purchases to 10 within a 30-day period, but this limit may be adjusted over time. While Tokens will be available immediately from the Shop, please note that there may be a delay before Tokens put up for sale on the Auction House become available for purchase with gold.<br>
