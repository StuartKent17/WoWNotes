Boubouille2008-03-20, 12:16 AMUpdate 17:00 CET - Blizzard World Wide Invitational 2008 tickets are now on sale https://eu.blizzard.com/wwi08-tickets/sales/menu.html?locale=en_GB !
Update 10:00 CET - Added something about season 1 gear to the season 3 post, EU Migrations, new fan arts, and a little something about Kil'jaeden. 

Season 3 Gear rating requirement in Season 4
Shoulders requirement will be lowered to 1950 Personal Arena Rating, weapons to 1800.
There will be no changes to gear availability/rating requirement until Season 4 starts, which will not begin when patch 2.4 goes live.

When Season 4 starts here's what will happen:
Season 1 removed
Season 2 moved to honor
Season 3 rating requirements and prices lowered

Shoulders : 1950 rating
Weapons : 1800 rating
Season 4 gear added



Season 4 isn't expected to begin any time soon, but as always we plan to give at least a two week notice before it does. Stay tuned to these forums or any of your fine local fansites as I'm sure the information will spread fairly rapidly once we do announce a Season 4 start date.

Season 3 prices and Season 4 rating requirements are not yet announced. All information contained herein is of course, as always, subject to change.

What about the S1 Gear being removed ?
You get to keep your items of course, they'll just no longer be available for purchase from the vendors. Source http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5286577719&postId=53773201214&sid=1#44


First "real" screenshot of Kil'jaeden ?
I got an interesting mail a few hours ago, with a nice screenshot attached. According to the sender this is a leaked screenshot from a GM, I won't fully confirm it but it definitely looks legit enough to be posted. Keep in mind that it could be a fake, it's not "that" hard to get the 2.4 running on an emulated server and spawn Kil'jaeden, in this case his scale on live servers could be different.
