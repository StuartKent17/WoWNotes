This new PTR build had its share of Tier 9 updates, the models for the Leather_ArgentHorde are available and we now have the prices for each piece. The biggest change here is the introduction of a common token for all armor parts, you can buy the Head/Hands/Chest/Legs/Shoulders of your set with a single item. Example: Regalia of the Grand Conqueror

Patch 3.2 Raid Lockout Extension
A new feature has been introduced in this build, you can now extend your raid lockout to make them last one more week. This is probably very useful if your guild is trying to get a specific boss down and doesn't really need any other loot in the instance, you can just get one more weeks of tries without having to clean everything in the way.
