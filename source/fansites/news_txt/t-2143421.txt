Ring in the New Year with a Grand Fireworks Display!
Head to your favorite capital city to watch fireworks light the skies beginning at 6:00 p.m. realm time tonight December 31 and every hour on the hour. It’s a celebration you won’t want to miss, so get on your /dancing shoes and don your finest party transmog as we ring in a new year.

If you’re on a PvP realm, we’d advise extra caution around Booty Bay. The guards don’t seem to be enforcing the town rules and won’t be until the new day dawns.


Armory Stats - Winter Veil Gifts
As we wait for the new year to arrive, we are taking a look back to see how many current players have the old Winter Veil gifts. For these stats, we defined current player as any player that had a Level 110 character that has logged in during the past two months. 

Keep in mind that the number for this year isn't quite accurate yet, as you can still open gifts for a while. While we were gathering data, we noticed that only 83,990 players in our database have all 10 years of gifts!

Holidays 

New Year’s Fireworks! [December 31- January 1]
Ring in the new year in Azeroth by heading to your favorite capital city to watch the fireworks displays which will begin at 6 pm PST and reoccur every hour on the hour. If you’re up for a little extra PvP, you may want to head toward Booty Bay where the guards have eschewed the town rules for the night.

Lunar Festival [ January 21- February 4]
Every year the druids of Moonglade hold a celebration of their city’s great triumph over an ancient evil. During the Lunar Festival, citizens of Azeroth have the opportunity to honor their elders by celebrating their sage wisdom, sharing in magnificent feasts, and of course… shooting firewoks!

2016 in Brief
2016 has been a great and terrible year for the citizens of Azeroth. The forces of the Horde and Alliance both managed to defend Draenor from the machinations of Gul’dan and his Legion allies within Hellfire Citadel, but in turn, the Burning Legion has set its sights once more on Azeroth. New heroes have arisen with the addition of the Demon Hunters who have joined in the fight to save Azeroth from the onslaught in the World of Warcraft:Legion http://us.battle.net/wow/en/legion/ expansion. The next chapters have yet to be told, but we know the heroes of Azeroth will rise to the challenge as each present themselves.

Fan Art
Artists from around the world have continued to share their amazing pieces of work with us and we wanted to take a moment to show off some of the amazing pieces they’ve created throughout the year.

We look forward to seeing what the talented World of Warcraft community will create next!

What’s Your 2017 WoW Resolution?
It’s that time again, in which we all take a look at our lives in Azeroth and make a resolution or two on what we plan to do in the year ahead. Whether it’s to help new players every third Friday, get that one Achievement you just haven’t gotten yet, or to take your Mythic Keystone difficulty even further, we want to know.

What’s your 2017 WoW Resolution? Share it with us in the comments below.

We hope everyone has a safe and happy New Year and look forward to another great year ahead!
