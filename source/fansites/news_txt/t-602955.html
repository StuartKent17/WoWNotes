<br>
Update : It seems that the &quot;No ETA&quot; wasn&apos;t really needed, it&apos;s already in the PTR Build applied today on test realms. Natural Perfection and Focused Will have been changed again, blue posts below updated. It also means that the talents modified in the latest build of the PTR (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/focunatu.jpg) are already outdated. ^^<br>
<br>
(Updated) Focused Will (Priest) changes<br>
Healer&apos;s day ! Follow-up of yesterday&apos;s post about priests, and a talent upgrades for druids.<br>
Feedback was read, gathered and the designers are fully aware of all that you&apos;ve provided. As a result, we&apos;re making an adjustment to the talent so instead of seeing this morning&apos;s version of focused will in the next PTR push, you&apos;ll see:<br>
<br>
&quot;After taking a critical hit you gain the Focused Will effect, reducing all damage taken by 1/3/5% and increasing healing effects on you by 4/7/10% for 6 seconds. Stacks up to 3 times.&quot;<br>
<br>
(Updated) Natural Perfection (Druid) Changes<br>
We&apos;ve read through a great deal of feedback and are making another adjustment to the natural perfection talent which you&apos;ll see in the next PTR data push.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now also grants the Natural Perfection effect after being critically hit, reducing all damage taken by 1/3/5% for 6 seconds. Stacks up to 3 times.&quot; <br>
