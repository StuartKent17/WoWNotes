Basically, it will give you a complete list of people in your guild with enough reputation to get the heroic keys. The Violet Eye reputation is the Karazhan access (anyone with more than 1850 Reputation or more can be considered to have his access). <br>

Blizzard posters made tons of new posts today, let&apos;s resume everything (and also add the things I missed in the last days) sorted from the most interesting to &quot;who cares about this ?&quot; :<br>

We still don&apos;t have an exact estimate on when this patch will be ready but development is wrapping up and the test phase should begin relatively soon. As a reminder, the patch undergoes internal testing before public, PTR testing. <br>

We&apos;re looking at this encounter for possible changes in 2.1.0. No exact details yet. The goal is to bring the difficulty in line with the other two opera house events. <br>

We are aware that Hunters and Warlocks still have problems with their pets, when taking off on their flying mounts (The pet is still running and aggros all mobs, or it lands off with its master and then disappears). We recently said that this problem would be solved for Hunter and Warlock pets and in regards to that, we would like to inform you that we expect to have that issue resolved in the patch 2.1. <br>
<br>
When the Hunter or Warlock is mounting a flying mount, the pet will automatically be &#x201C;saved&#x201D; and then un-summon, and dismounting the flying mount will cause the pets to re-summon immediately (This will also happen when using a flight path). <br>
