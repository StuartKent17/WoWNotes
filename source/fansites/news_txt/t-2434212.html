The BlizzCon 2018 Virtual Ticket is now available for purchase and if you&#x2019;re a World of Warcraft fan you won&#x2019;t want to miss a moment of the event&#x2014;or the WoW extras that come with it, including epic in-game goodies and access to the Blizzcon WoW Classic demo at home!<br>
<br>
World of Warcraft&#xAE; Classic BlizzCon&#xAE; Demo<br>
Every BlizzCon, we look for opportunities to bring new aspects of the experience to our community around the world. This year, we&#x2019;re excited to announce that for the first time ever, BlizzCon Virtual Ticket holders will join BlizzCon attendees as the first people to play the World of Warcraft Classic demo we&#x2019;re creating for BlizzCon at home.<br>
<br>
Shortly after the BlizzCon opening ceremony on November 2 (on or around 1pm PDT), players will be able to download the same in-development BlizzCon WoW Classic Demo that will be playable on the show floor. Players will have a chance to explore and enjoy a limited questing experience through a pair of classic early-level zones&#x2014;one Horde and one Alliance&#x2014;and experience firsthand our recreation of the original Azeroth.<br>
<br>
Once the demo is live, you&#x2019;ll be able to play until 10am PST on November 8, giving BlizzCon attendees a chance to check it out again once they get back home.<br>
<br>
Declare Your Allegiance With BlizzCon In-Game Loot<br>
In addition to access to the BlizzCon WoW Classic Demo, starting today BlizzCon attendees and Virtual Ticket holders will receive commemorative in-game items that will help them proudly display their Horde or Alliance pride as the Battle for Azeroth rages on:<br>
<br>
<br>
War Mantle of the Alliance &amp; War Mantle of the Horde: Show all of Azeroth where your allegiance lies with a pair of faction-themed cosmetic cloaks&#x2014;one for Horde characters, and one for Alliance.<br>
Stormwind Champion&#x2019;s War Banner &amp; Orgrimmar Hero&#x2019;s War Banner: Strike fear into your enemies and stand your ground when you plant your faction&#x2019;s banner on the battlefield.<br>
<br>
<br>
In addition to this year&#x2019;s WoW items and access to the BlizzCon WoW Classic demo, the Virtual Ticket provides plenty of great BlizzCon content for your viewing pleasure along with additional in-game goodies from Overwatch&#xAE;, Diablo&#xAE; III, Hearthstone&#xAE;, Heroes of the Storm&#xAE;, and StarCraft&#xAE; II.<br>
