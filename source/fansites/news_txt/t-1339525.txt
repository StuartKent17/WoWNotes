Rated Battlegrounds
you can say: wait? what the difference with Random battlegrounds? 
Indeed and that is exactly the issue. Rated BG's have higher rewards than random BG's because of the organisation that is involved in getting the group together and coordinating them for success against another organised group. 

Also you are always forced to go on a communication program like teamspeak what not everyone likes to do. 
This is one of the parts involved in trying to run an organised group, not all information can be given through chat, especially quick commands for targets and CC. This is not to say it's required, but it's definitely recommended to improve your chances of victory.

So when you hit 90, and want to pvp. you first have to farm all honor gear, witch is a REAL REAL PAIN to do. Because everything 2 shots you and you hit like a wet towel. 
The damage received by freshly dinged players is generally the same as those who are fully geared, depending on what you gem and enchant. This is because of the implementation of base resilience to all players. The main difference is the damage or healing you do, but that doesn't mean that you're unable to contribute.

And random BG's is swarmed with bot's. i'm not even start talking about this. 
I'll just touch on it quickly and say that we are constantly dealing with the issue of bots and are doing everything we can to lower and remove the impact they have on your experience in World of Warcraft. Also; if bots are something that concerns you in random BG's, then creating a queuing system for rated BG's would also feed this across to the conquest grind as well.

We understand that there are benefits behind having a queue for rated BG's and that there are people that would like to see this implemented, but we also feel that there are more positives than negatives behind keeping it restricted to premade groups only. This is not to say that the discussion is closed, we greatly appreciate any feedback that you have on the subject.

Blue Tweets
Professions
Made an account just to ask this; Are there any plans to update crafting professions to keep up with the leveling process?
Yes, but no immediate announcements. We agree it's a problem. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/370982752616607744

are we definetly going to see the sky golem next patch? 
I can never say definitely until the patch ships, because sometimes there are last minute changes. At the moment, it looks good. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372172127383736323

UI / Addons
I wonder, do you use addons for raiding or you're confident about original UI? #notgoingtoabuseyoureanswer
It varies. I'm responsible for UI so I feel an obligation to experience the game sans mods. I like to see why mods are popular too. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/371347556053180416
I'd argue and do, as a game designer and lecturer that WoW's mods are important - can config UI as people like!
Oh, totally agree. I meant specific mods that gain a lot of popularity. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372081859447902208

Character / Items
Concerned about valor points in 5.4... got 11 90's running out of stuff to buy in 5.3, so what will we spend valor on in 5.4?
Upgrading your best gear. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/369122544189599746

ok so dumb question....why is it harder to get justice points than it is to get valor points?
We didn't do at great job of integrating justice points into the MoP reward tapestry. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/371727328583233536

Why no mastery at low level? Shouldn't players have more time to get used to stat effects/usefulness?
We find new and low level players have plenty of things to learn. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373174424247087105

Why no siege weapons have no cool procs?
We wanted the heirlooms http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/weapons?filter-patch=3388&filter-bind=10 to be very competitive, which would be tough if there were procs competing with them. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372172599733665792
Procs are cool. We will do them again. The SoO trinkets http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/armor/trinkets?filter-patch=3388 are pretty cool in the meantime. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372172679228313600

restricting dailies is a terrible idea. Make the REP they give accountwide, not the quests.
What about the concern that if player X does 100 dailies a day, I have to as well to keep up? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372080666814316545
I just don't want to have to unlock the quartermaster 10x over. Is that asking too much?
In vanilla, many of us had 1-2 characters. Now many have 5-10. They don't want to do something 5-10 times, understandably. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372096013823012864
We know some players want to be able to raid on all their alts without having to spend much time gearing them up. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372095747195293696
But if you're trying to level up alts now, I would skip the quatermasters and do Barrens in 5.3 or Timeless Isle in 5.4. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372095191298998272
The issue here, as it always is, is how much commitment should the second and so on character require? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372095289915473921
if cataclysm was too alt friendly, I think mop shifted that paradigm slightly too far in the other direction.
We agree with that. Our main goal for MoP was to make sure players always had plenty to do. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372165698467790848
If you have one character, that should work fine for you. If you have five, I can see how it was overwhelming. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372165802473975808
5.4 is pretty alt-friendly though, in the same way the final patch of past expansions were. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372166021303369728
Our goal is to make the second take less than the first, but still not zero. We know that won't make some players happy. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372095381703634944
Which quartermaster is a problem? If you had to do it 5 times in 5.0, then that is a problem, as we've said. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372095086399467520
Blacksmith needs Klaxxi. Tailor/Enchanter August Celestials. LW need Golden Lotus. Thank you for listening. 
Does it demean your effort if every player with several 90s had access to all those recipes once they did it on 1 character? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372097555657531392

Honestly all I want is my Cloud Serpent Riding.
We might change the riding requirement to account-wide in 5.4. Feels like it has served its purpose. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/371354803005165568

Expansions every year in future? So people who hate leveling should just quit? FYI leveling is awful for some.
It is a problem for sure. We lose a lot of folks who never make it to max level or even expansion min level. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372094515756011520

Your stated design intent: legendaries useful for a whole expansion. Reality: 5.0-5.1 legs useless in 5.4. Please revise.
I believe that design intent was about weapons. Regardless, your meta gem will still work. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/371739500306628608
Having every orange item stick around 5.4 would be too much power difference between haves and have nots. It's huge as it is. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/371739704816697344

Misc
i've been wondering like forever...what does "lead systems designer" entail exactly? i can see many overlaps.
We use systems as in contrast to content. Content does levels and quests. Systems does features and combat. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373525908163817472
Encounter designers are part of the systems team, largely because they are so combat focused. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373526089731026945
Overall there is a ton of overlap. A systems designer may help out on pet battles. We all contribute to scenarios. Etc. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373526261315817472

I asked what he does focus on as the lead dev, not what should he.
Spend most of my time making sure other designers aren't blocked, ideas for future content, systems work with programmers. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373512476274348032

Because every blue post seems to be "well I don't think so" or "maybe someday". If you cant answer something don't even bother
Players get upset if you never answer but very few of our answers are going to be "We agree! Change incoming!" Kind of a catch 22. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372556625514491904

Could make the case that WoW has enough cognitive difficulty that mechanical difficulty in leveling would be wasted
I like leveling being challenging personally. The problem is our attempts to make leveling faster also made it easier. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/372555437108760576
