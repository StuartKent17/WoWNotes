Thank you very much to everyone who&#x2019;ve helped test the closed beta for WoW Classic. Over the last seven weeks, we have reviewed over 17000 bug reports from testers. These led to our verification of hundreds of new and unique bugs. Your efforts have directly contributed to making WoW Classic a better experience for everyone when it opens to the world on August 27.<br>
<br>
We have now reached a stage where WoW Classic is in a good state for reconciling remaining issues, and we intend to shift our focus away from the closed beta, which will end on July 12.<br>
<br>
Internally, we&#x2019;re working through the aforementioned bug fixes, testing the high-level zones such as Eastern Plaguelands, and doing our raid testing. We&#x2019;ll make sure Ragnaros and Onyxia are ready to go.<br>
<br>
As for what&#x2019;s next, the final stress test is now coming up on July 25-26 (we&#x2019;ve changed this date since we first announced it). During that global test, we will roll out our multi-region hardware in preparation for the worldwide release of WoW Classic. In addition to getting many more testers to play through the initial leveling experiences, it will be a test of the fixes and tweaks that we&#x2019;ve made and are making to the game.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;re planning a small in-game event to end the closed beta on July 12. We&#x2019;ll see you there, and we&#x2019;ll post reminders for you just before the stress test, as well as reminders in August as we gather for name reservations and ultimately for the release of WoW Classic.<br>
<br>
Thank you!</div></div>
