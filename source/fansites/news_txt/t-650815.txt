Blue posts
Ironbound/Rusted Proto-Drake Achievement Rewards removed in the future
Sorry if there was any confusion on these mounts being removed in the future. I am working on getting an official response put together that covers the situation. There are some factors to consider, but we do plan to remove them. I have not heard of any plans to put in a replacement reward. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/17367881473-ironboundrusted-protodrake.html

All instances are full!
The limit on the number of instances has been around for awhile now. We feel this was needed to preserve the game play for those already in the instances as it would eventually deteriorate when too many instances were up.

That said, we do not feel feel this is a permanent fix and have been working on a more long term solution for quite awhile now. 

[...] There are no specifics I can provide at this time, but I can assure you we knew about this issue quite awhile ago when we had to start limiting the number of instances. This was never meant to be something we would put in and just ignore until players complained about it enough. I can assure you we are actively in the process of a more long term solution but these take a lot of time to plan out and implement so it won't be done overnight. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17368013775-all-instances-full--please-try-again-later.html

Is there any plan to remove some of the Argent Tournament rewards in 3.2?
There are no plans to remove any of the rewards at this time. A couple of goblin quests though may be disappearing because, well, they will be done. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17367602877-argent-tournament-rewards-disappearing.html

Pure vs Hybrid classes
At a grossly simplistic level, the two buckets we use are classes with single role "pures" versus multiple roles "hybrids". We don't make much of a distinction beyond that of how many healing specs a class can have or how many healing roles they can fill on a fight. The question is "Can you reroll to fill a different role?" For all healers, the answer is yes.

You might see slightly more priests just because they can fulfill two different healing roles, but to be honest we are seeing a pretty big diversity in who is brought into Ulduar to heal even for hardmodes that has a lot to do with guild style, tradition, player skill and synergy.

Hotfixing Heroic Strike
We haven't changed Heroic Strike yet because just inflating its rage cost or nerfing rage generation in general would hurt warrior threat generation. This isn't in the zone of simple hotfix material. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17367602445-bring-back-the-old-shield-blockfix-war-block.html

Generating rage from damage only
Having warriors only or mostly generate rage from damage done is an intriguing idea that has come up a few times. It would help the problem where better gear leads to rage starvation at least in lower instances and where warriors have trouble OT'ing because they aren't getting hit. It might also get warriors to care slightly more about dps stats instead of focusing mostly on survival stats. This would all apply to druids too. This isn't a change we have in the pipe, but it is something we discuss from time to time. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17367602445-bring-back-the-old-shield-blockfix-war-block.html
