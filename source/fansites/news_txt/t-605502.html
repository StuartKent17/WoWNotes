The Twin Eredars have been killed a decent amount of time now, and we can assume that we heard about all the items dropping from them by now, the latest additions are the 3 Shoulders drop (That&apos;s 6 new items because they&apos;re all exchangeable). They&apos;re not new items, just an addition to the loot table to make it complete. Reminder : Items tagged with a (*) in the list are available from the vendor on the Sunwell Isle if you can provide the loot above it on the list along with a Sunmote. <br>

Worldwide Arena Battle on TTR<br>
A Worldwide Arena Battle will be held on Tournament Test Realm on Sunday between 12PM and 3PM PST.<br>
Are you ready to take on the world in the arenas? The World of Warcraft team will be testing the WoW Arena Tournament on the Tournament Test Realm, and you are invited to be a part of the action. Players in all regions will access the same realm, so the call is going out to all PvPers in North America, Europe, and Korea to log into the Arena Tournament Test Realm and participate in all-out PvP action!<br>
<br>
The Worldwide Arena Battle will take place this Sunday between 12PM to 3PM PST, and members of the Community and Development teams will join in the fray, including a head to head match between community managers from around the world for world dominance. The results will also be posted on the Tournament forum!<br>
<br>
No character copies will be needed for this unique event as you will get access to the character and gear of your choice just by logging in. The 2.4 PTR patch will provide access to the Tournament realm so download it soon and we&#x2019;ll see you on the battlefield!<br>
<br>
If you didn&apos;t install your PTR client yet, you can download it through the Blizzard download (from the Test Realm page on the official site) or just use the following temporary mirrors.<br>
<br>
PTR Client mirrors<br>
This is the original file to install the PTR client, then run the WoW.exe in your WoWTest folder to get all the PTR updates (there are a few of them, probably 6 or 7, and you&apos;ll have to install them one by one) <br>

Warlocks and mages changes in the expansion<br>
Warlocks will get a few new abilities in the expansion, Kalgan posted about one of them on the forums. Keep in mind that it&apos;s just an idea and it could perfectly not be included in the final version of the expansion.<br>
We definitely feel the need for warlocks to gain some sort of active defense so we don&apos;t have to try to balance them around the assumption that they&apos;re &quot;tanking&quot; melee classes. For example, an idea we&apos;re running with internally is the concept of a warlock being able to cast a spell that places a circle of demonic power on the ground. The warlock would be able to teleport to this location from within a relatively short range (ie: 40 yards), and would also be able to summon demons more quickly if they&apos;re standing within the circle.<br>
<br>
Note: this idea is intended as a sneak peek, it&apos;s not something that we&apos;re planning for 2.4, it would be more likely as an expansion ability, and may change entirely before said time. <br>
<br>
Mages will also get a few nice things, especially when it comes to warlocks/mages balancing in PvP.<br>
Mages will get new abilities in the expansion too, believe it or not. In fact, we intend to tone down how strong of a counter warlocks are to mages through the wotlk spells/talents.<br>
<br>
<br>
WotLK - Lake Wintergrasp popularity<br>
If you&apos;ve been asking yourself if Lake Wintergrasp (the expansion outdoor PvP zone) will be popular or not, it seems that Blizzard is fairly confident about its future success.<br>
Based on the information we already know, I think it will be more active than Halaa because one of the things that hurt Halaa was the Diminishing Returns on honor points. With this removed in patch 2.4 people will be able to continue piling up honor points until they&apos;ve had enough. I know rewards play a huge factor, so with the knowledge that people have now of items we&apos;ve made available through honor points, I think it will continue to be a busy place for a long time.<br>

US Realms - Central US Internet issues<br>
If you&apos;ve been high latency and unusual things on US realms, you might want to watch updates on this thread. <br>
A network degradation outside of the Blizzard network is currently impacting several World of Warcraft realms. Players attempting to access the impacted realms may be experiencing high network latency, packet loss, disconnections or inability to connect. We are actively receiving updates from the parties involved and have been assured that the issue is actively being worked on; however, we have not yet received any estimates for when a resolution may occur. We will continue to provide updates as we receive further information.</div></div>
