Is this still a thing that will happen or is planned? http://t.co/qUYPAFlmIB

Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Was removal of threat as an active mechanic in WoW a mistake?
I tanked for a long time and I always found it fun as a tank. I don't think it was as fun for everyone depending on the tank. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/647918642982612992

I absolutely love Vashj'ir, deep sea exploration that was breath taking, literally. Why the backlash? 
IMO the zone was too big and we never quite solved the 3D disorientation and target selection. While realistic, it wasn't awesome. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/647918993160802304

An announcement about combat changes in Knights of Fallen Empire was posted yesterday, with one of the more interesting features being Level Sync. 


Players will be scaled down to the target level of the planets they visit, having their stats, armor, and weapon damage reduced, but keeping all of their abilities.
Players also will earn scaled experience, meaning they that if a player is level 60 and is killing level 30 mobs, they will gain experience appropriate for being a level 60.
This means players can return to older content and play it closer to the intended experience, while still progressing their character.
