Battle.Net Desktop App Chat
We recently got some updates on chat in the Battle.Net Desktop App http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3273-Battle-net-Desktop-Client-Services-Activated-and-Beta-Test-Opt-in and the Appear Offline mode http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/236762-appear-offline-option-coming-soon-to-battlenet/ from a while back. 

A recent update to the client removed one of the older chat display styles, added and tweaked avatars, modified some chat related things, and removed the Beta label.

If you're an astute observer, you'll note from various postings on the internet that there is indeed chat functionality inside the client, but it is disabled.

The reason why it isn't enabled is simple. The servers aren't ready to handle it yet.

Having said that, chat will be ready soontm

Better answer would be "chat is not ready yet" than "servers can't handle it"
You're right, poor choice of words. Chat was definitely not ready, but it is closer now.

The problem with the chat system was related to when you're logged into multiple games at the same time. For purposes of this discussion, Battle.net app is considered another game. 

See who is online You'll need friends for this. In a future update coming soon you'll be able to chat with them too. Source http://us.battle.net/en/forum/topic/11882868485?page=3#55

Classes
"We want to reduce the amount of buttons required to play and make the game easier for players who come back." WHY DUMB IT DOWN?
Reducing the number of buttons required is not the same as dumbing it down. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438159423291154433

More behind the scenes of class design:There are hard many parts of designing a spell, but most people wouldn't guess one of the hardest. Naming it. Giving a spell a good name is paramount. It has to be representative, awesome sounding, appropriate, etc. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438547225858154496
One of the most difficult things is resisting the urge to use "Divine" or "Holy" on a Paladin/Priest spell, *again*. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438549783825772544

Keeping 100% uptime on DOTs and performing a filler rotation is not engaging. Intelligently using procs is
Intelligently using procs isn't going away. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438432424498716672
Don't mistake snapshotting's removal for procs not benefitting you. Procs' effects are just restricted to their duration now. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438432720398462976
if that is the case are we looking at dynamic updating of DOTs in Warlord's?
Yes, that's what removing snapshotting is. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438435463133556736
Since it Dynamically updates there's no other point. Basically DoT classes are boring now?
No, pretty sure you're misunderstanding something fundamental. DoTs are updated on every tick, not when they wear off. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438542098623504384

Art
will you update the character login backgrounds along with the new models? The UD one is very outdated. Thanks!
I agree those need some love, maybe not at same time as characters but its something we've wanted to do for a while now. artofcgrobinson https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/431843557784047616

Hello good sir, with the new character model updates in WoD i was hoping to see an option for long beards for my casters!
cool idea, not adding extra options with this pass, hope to do so in the future. artofcgrobinson https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/431842694055198720

Proving Grounds
Any plans for handling scaling of CMs/PGs different in WoD? Scaling down 120 ilvls makes classes play very differently.
We're investigating the potential of scaling PGs up to your ilvl. Not a guarantee, just an investigation. Has Pros/Cons. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438039015468437504

PvP
Will most classes only have one viable spec for pvp like warriors in WoD? would be easier to balance?
It is a decent goal for classes that only have one role, but not for classes that have multiple. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/433439167754694657

Can you implement the SotA bomb extra action button in IoC as well?
Yes eventually. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/431843409372790784

you know why resi should be in gear? Smooth resi scaling. Suddenly added big resi feels bad. Takes time for gear to fix.
Certainly true. But the whole player base doesn't gear at the same rate, specifically ungeared players entering the game. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438796918185938944

Was leaving resilience on heirlooms an oversight? Maybe it could be replaced with something more useful?
Resilience is on all lower level gear holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438796576505335808

why didnt you reset mmr?
We don't reset MMR because it is system designed to match up players of equal skill. We do reset inflation however. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438429905701720064
