We agree with some of the recent discussion about Enhancement dps. We are going to hotfix a change to the Flurry talent to increase it from 25% to 30% attack speed with 5 ranks.<br>
<br>
We also agree that Enhancement may have survivability problems and understand that players don&apos;t necessarily feel they can afford the bonus Stamina from the Toughness talent, at least in PvE. We don&apos;t have an immediate change to deploy here, but it&apos;s something we&apos;d like to fix and a candidate for future patches.</div></div>
