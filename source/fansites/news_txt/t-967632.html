Battleground Win Ratios<br>
I&apos;ll bring it up in our next developer meeting, but in all likelihood, since that could potentially dramatically impact queue times for random Battlegrounds, it probably won&apos;t fly.<br>
<br>
[...] I said that there would be a greater emphasis on creating new Battlegrounds on the future. I should note that we&apos;re slowly working toward new technology to make the creation and modification of battlegrounds something we can do more readily too. <br>
<br>
I also might have made it sound like the older Battlegrounds will never change again. That&apos;s not what I meant to get across. We&apos;ve redone AV several times throughout the years, and it may see more changes in the future. I just wanted to note that the emphasis is going to be shifted a bit, that&apos;s all.
