Reddit user Nivens (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/c0086d/are_you_aware_that_the_maximum_level_of_120_will/) reported that they received an interesting survey from Blizzard regarding an upcoming level squish. The wording of this survey makes it seem that a level squish is already slated to happen sometime in the future. This has not been confirmed by Blizzard.<br>

During a previous Battle for Azeroth Q&amp;A (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7780-Developer-Q-A-with-Ion-Hazzikostas-Battle-for-Azeroth) on Twitch, Ion Hazzikostas said the team was exploring the idea of a level squish, as new players may be deterred by seeing such high levels needed to reach the endgame. You can watch the full answer to the level squish question here (https://www.twitch.tv/videos/286658051?t=0h44m03s), where they discuss the pros and cons. <br>

At the Summer Finals, teams will compete for $100,000 and two qualification spots at BlizzCon. The first Cup has already begun, and the top 8 teams have already been decided in NA and EU after an explosive Open Bracket (https://www.twitch.tv/videos/438046101).<br>
