<br>
The secrets behind the loot tables<br>
There&apos;s always been a lot of question around this and Drysc decided to explain how everything works.<br>
Loot is generated upon creation. As soon as you step into an instance, or a mob is created in the world, the loot that&apos;s going to drop has already been determined.<br>
<br>
is it based on some attribute of the players in the raid, or the raid leader?<br>
Heh, no. I believe it uses a time stamp to seed the generator. So, there&apos;s nothing you can influence within the game that would alter or coerce the generator.<br>
<br>
Does it mean that killing the same boss at the exact same time each week will get players the same loot everytime ?<br>
No, the time it uses to seed would have no real implication into the final outcome of what loot its given. On a long enough generation table, you may see some type of pattern based purely on a random generators inability to truly be random. But we&apos;re talking about astronomical numbers, something ridiculous like hundreds of billions of generations. Nothing you would or could see a pattern in during your time playing the game.<br>
<br>
What you&apos;re seeing is pure and basic laws of probability. Have a few thousand people roll a pair of dice and you&apos;re bound to see hundreds of people able to roll snake-eyes 10 times in a row. (not that dice are truly random either)<br>
<br>
Personal Rating Issue<br>
The bug affecting some players and removing them from the wrong arena team when attempting to leave another one has been identified, however it can&apos;t be fixed without a patch and support teams won&apos;t be able to reimburse any lost ratings during this time.<br>
An issue has been identified that is sometimes causing players to be removed from the wrong Arena Team when attempting to leave a different team (being removed from the 5v5 team when trying to leave the 2v2 team, for example).<br>
<br>
As a direct result of this some players are inadvertently losing some of their personal rating.<br>
<br>
We expect this issue to be resolved in an upcoming patch, but we regret to inform you that our support teams will be unable to reimburse any lost ratings during this time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Alliance / Horde balance<br>
PvE servers are full of night elves and TBC PvP servers are full of blood elves, but it&apos;s not that bad actually, we could have had gnomes instead. <br>
That&apos;s a bit more complex. Old timey PvE realms, which are generally the ones queuing as far as PvE goes, are all Alliance heavy. The only realms that are Horde heavy are TBC launch day PvP realms. How many people do you think want to transfer from their PvP realm to a PvE realm?<br>
<br>
However, Malygos, has a pretty close 2:1 Alliance/Horde ratio. Which, while isn&apos;t necessarily ideal, has been the going rate for PvE faction balance since the launch of the game.<br>
<br>
That&apos;s a good transition for the following post, with Drysc answering to the people asking if it will be possible to transfer from alliance to horde in the future. Short answer : no.<br>
<br>
It&apos;s always been talked about within the community and so it&apos;s something we&apos;ve always been aware of. I think the undertaking is just so complex and potentially dangerous to the game that it&apos;s not something we&apos;re currently investing in. The Blood Elf addition to the horde, as well as the shaman/paladin swap were probably the biggest attempts at encouraging better faction balance. Trust me when I say US realms have it really great as far as faction balance goes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Other blue posts<br>
Is there any plan to increase the speed of mounts even more ?<br>
Probably not. We&apos;ve stated a few times that the higher end flight speed right now is right up to the limit (and maybe a bit faster) of the speed we want players traveling at. It&apos;s unlikely that we&apos;ll allow it to go too much faster. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4311202990&amp;postId=43107058120&amp;sid=1#14))<br>
<br>
New non-transfer realms<br>
At this time we have no announcement to make regarding a new non-transfer realm. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4311203341&amp;postId=43107463941&amp;sid=1#9))<br>
<br>
Beastiary update<br>
It will be updated, but it hasn&apos;t been up even one week yet, heh. Being updated &quot;regularly&quot; doesn&apos;t mean a direct timeline, but it will get numerous updates before the expansion launches and we will likely post about them on the forums as they come.

US Realms - Free character transfers and new server<br>
US Realms are getting a LOT of free character transfers, and also a new server (Ghostlands) to help some of the most heavily populated realms.<br>
We will be offering free character moves from selected high population realms to lower populated realms, assisting in population dispersal. The ability to move a character on the selected source realms will become available on Thursday, January 31 at 3:00 PM PST, and are scheduled to run until Thursday, February 7 at 3:00 PM PST.<br>
<br>
In the event that a realm meets our transfer goals before the scheduled end date, the transfers to that realm will be disabled. We highly recommend that if you are planning to transfer that you do so at your earliest convenience. No characters will be eligible for these free moves once the transfers have been closed.<br>
<br>
Once the transfers open you can begin your transfer by visiting the Character Move page located here: https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html (https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html)<br>
<br>
The realms chosen consist of source realms with the highest sustained queues, and destination realms with the lowest population. The numbers gathered are directly from our data, and depict the realms in most need of these transfers. We will be continuing to monitor all realms and open additional free transfers in the future where necessary. <br>
<br>
Source A (PvP) - Arthas, Burning Blade, Illidan, Skullcrusher, Warsong<br>
Destination A (PvP) - Balnazzar<br>
<br>
Source B (PvP) - Mal&apos;Ganis, Mug&#x2019;thol, Sargeras, Tichondrius, Twisting Nether<br>
Destination B (PvP) - Onyxia<br>
<br>
Source C (PvP) - Gorefiend, Kel&apos;Thuzad, Mannoroth, Shattered Hand, Smolderthorn<br>
Destination C (PvP) - Malorne<br>
<br>
Source D (PvE) - Aerie Peak, Aggramar, Alexstrasza, Alleria, Argent Dawn, Blackhand, Cenarius, Doomhammer, Hellscream, Whisperwind<br>
Desination D (PvE) - Ghostlands* <br>
<br>
(*) Ghostlands is a new realm. Character creation for this realm will be turned off for the duration of the transfers. <br>

World of Warcraft services on mobile phones<br>
According to Blizzplanet (http://blizzplanet.com/news/2049/), a few weeks ago Blizzard trademarked something named &quot;Battlechat (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/battlechat.jpg)&quot; used for &quot;Virtual network telecommunications services, namely, providing an interface of the electronic transmission of messages and data including voice, test, and message transmission.&quot;<br>
<br>
This follows another rumors based on a comment made by Paul Maglione (Vivendi Games Mobile boss) during an interview with pocketgamer.co.uk (http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Mobile/Vivendi+Games+Mobile+News/feature.asp?c=5520)<br>
<br>
Pocketgamer - We had a chance to get the official line, when Vivendi Games Mobile boss Paul Maglione was sitting in the audience for one of the panel sessions at MGF, and was asked directly about mobile World of Warcraft.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mobile aspects will become part of all MMOs,&quot; he replied, with a distinct smile on his face.<br>
<br>
There is nothing official from Blizzard, and it doesn&apos;t look like a WoW service at all for the moment (Battlechat is very close to Battle.net, which is mainly used for the RTS games from Blizzard). However it wouldn&apos;t be too hard to find a few things to offer to people to let them manage their character from their mobile.<br>
