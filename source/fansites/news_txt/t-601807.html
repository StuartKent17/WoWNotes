Even if we don&apos;t know how many yet, 2.2 version will include new raid loots, this could be a single loot just added to the Black Temple (probably Illidari Council according to the name) to &quot;balance&quot; the addition of 2 new spell damage shields to the arena rewards, or the first of an huge list of tons of epix. <br>
