Patch 8.2.5 Hotfixes - August 27, 2019
Dungeons and Raids

Siege of Boralus

Corrected an error during Mythic Keystone Dungeon instances that caused a pack of enemies to not appear in Upton Borough if the World Quest “Breaking the Alliance” was active.



Items

Fixed an issue that prevented Dribbling Inkpod from inflicting damage on targets under crowd control effects or that were not in line of sight.
Anu-Azshara, Staff of the Eternal’s Potency buff should now respect line of sight.
Leviathan's Lure should no longer break enemies out of crowd control effects.
The Map to the Last Worldvein no longer shows up as a quest reward when finishing the weekly Island Expedition quests “Azerite for the Alliance” or “Azerite for the Horde.” The item will still have the same chance to come from the quest as it does now. 
The Rank 4 Essence items that drop from Mythic Queen Azshara Vitality Conduit and Azeroth's Undying Gift now display red text for classes that cannot use them. 

Developers’ note: This should help Mythic raiders who wish to trade an Essence to a different player verify that it’s compatible with that character’s class.



Mounts

Siltwing Albatross mount scale increased by 25% for most races; 50% for larger races.


WoW Classic

Realm populations are now measured against a realm’s absolute capacity. 

Developers’ note: This system now measures each realm against a realm’s absolute capacity. Medium indicates a healthy total population on a realm—well in excess of what we considered Full in 2006—with room for more players to log-in. You’ll now see a High label if the realm is close to having a queue, and a Full label if the realm currently has a queue.





PTR 15th Anniversary Alterac Valley Play with the Blues
Thank you all for testing Classic Alterac Valley with us on Thursday afternoon and posting the feedback above! It was fun to reminisce about the Alterac Valley of olde while we got more information on issues that we can address:


There were some NPCs notably Durgen Stormpike who weren’t the correct level. We’ve fixed this issue and other related bugs players have reported.
We hear you about the item-level of rewards from Classic AV, and we’re working on increasing them. We’ll let you know what that looks like once we’ve made a final adjustment.
We really appreciate your feedback on specific NPCs you thought were too easy or too tough, and we’re going to take all of it into account as we make a final tuning pass.


We noticed some players had questions about the specifics of this event battleground that haven’t been answered yet, so here are some additional details:


Players can queue up from level 10 to level 120, and will be set to level 60 in the instance.
Lower-level players will earn experience from monster kills, completing quests, and participating during events in the battleground, so we hope it will be a fun way to level characters during the World of Warcraft 15th Anniversary event.
Rewards are intended to be appropriate to your level.
You can queue up with a party or even a complete raid!


Thanks again, and we’ll see you again in Alterac Valley.


New Realm Population Label System
With a hotfix to WoW Classic a few moments ago, we’ve changed how the realm population labels work in order to display realm populations in a more meaningful way.

How it worked before this hotfix
As we explained here, the system previously calculated the population labels by comparing all realms to the most-populated realm. This could result in a very crowded realm with a lengthy queue showing up as “Medium”, since it was being compared to the realm that had the highest population and a potentially massive queue.

How population labels work now
This system now measures each realm against a realm’s absolute capacity. Medium indicates a healthy total population on a realm – well in excess of what we considered Full in a 2006 – with room for more players to log-in. You’ll now see a High label if the realm is close to having a queue, and a Full label if the realm currently has a queue.

We will continue to monitor this system closely and take further steps if necessary.

Thank you very much!


US - New Realms Open
We have opened new realms in this region:

Thunderfury - PvP - Pacific
Azuresong - Normal - Pacific
Windseeker - Normal - Eastern
Benediction - PvP - Eastern

We recommend that players looking to avoid queues on Full realms move to this new realm for a smoother experience.

Thank you!
