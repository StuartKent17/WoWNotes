2.2 PTR Patch<br>
The 2.2 Patch notes were updated and Curse.com (http://www.curse.com/articles/details/2857/) searched for the differences, nothing really interesting but the haste mechanics change is now confirmed.<br>
<br>
General<br>
Haste: Haste has been rebalanced. It has returned to the ratios from the launch of Burning Crusade. Melee attacks and spell casts will now benefit at identical rates from haste. This change results in a reduction in the benefit of haste for melee attacks and an increase in the benefit for spellcasters.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
Increased the duration of the Mystical Skyfire Diamond&apos;s cast speed buff to 10 seconds.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Professions<br>
Alchemy<br>
Flask of Shadow Fortification will transform into the Flask of Pure Death. This new flask increases Frost, Fire, and Shadow spell damage.<br>
Flask of Arcane Fortification will transform into the Flask of Blinding Light. This new flask increases Holy, Nature, and Arcane spell damage.<br>
A new flask that increases all resists and stats has been added to the Violet Eye reputation vendor.<br>
<br>
As a reminder, here is how it affects the major haste trinkets/weapons.<br>

Atiesh in WotLK Naxxramas<br>
Bornakk made a post about Atiesh in the level 80 version of Naxxramas. He also made two more posts that you might want to read for more explanations<br>
<br>
Decisions regarding important items like this must be made carefully. We need to make sure the story behind it feels right as we don&#x2019;t want to force an item with such stature into the game, but we will still make sure there are great items available for everybody to push for.<br>
<br>
At this time we are still working on retuning Naxxramas for Wrath of the Lich King and have not made any final determinations on Atiesh.<br>
