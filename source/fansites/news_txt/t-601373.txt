The Farming section has been updated. The new maps should be a lot easier to read, they're also bigger and I'll probably add a few spots that have been added in 2.1.0 in a later update. 

     
     

Comics
Missed a few one due to the intensive Arena Season 2 newsing, two LFG Comic, one Dark Legacy, and a WoW-Special comic on Public Access.
