weaponGet Your Artifact Weapon to at Least 35 Traits
Patch 7.2 introduces reworks to the existing Artifact Weapon system: 

Once you’ve earned 35 traits in your Artifact Weapons, you’ll be eligible for a new questline to empower your weapon.
Once completed, you'll be able to spend Artifact Power on new Empowered traits http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/artifact-traits?filter-patch=23436, new ranks for existing traits, and a new Infinite trait http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/239042-concordance-of-the-legionfall?artifactRank=1, which features 50 ranks.
Players who have put Artifact Power into their weapons beyond 35 traits will have all of this AP refunded and be able to allocate it to new traits.
Previously earned Artifact Power items will not be usable on the empowered Artifact Weapon, so don't stockpile your AP tokens.


<hr>
knowledgeCap Your Artifact Knowledge

Be sure that your artifact knowledge is maxed out.
If you’re researching on an alt character, you can purchase Artifact Research Compendiums http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Compendium&filter-quality=64 on your main to speed things along.
Make sure to hold on to enough Order Resources http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources for class hall upgrades. 
You can see the new Artifact Knowledge multipliers here http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6377-Patch-7-2-PTR-Build-23657#newak.


<hr>
orderComplete Order Hall Class Campaign

To continue with your order hall campaign in 7.2, you must have completed all currently available order hall quests.
In 7.2, players can earn a new champion, class-specific achievements, and the achievement Champions of Legionfall http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11846-champions-of-legionfall, which is required for Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Two http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11446-broken-isles-pathfinder-part-two.
Completion of the order hall class campaign awards your class-specific flying mount. You can check them out here http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6265-Patch-7-2-PTR-Build-23436-Class-Mount-Models.


<hr>
upgradesCollect 25,000 Order Resources for New Order Hall Research

If you haven’t already been stockpiling Order Resources http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources, you’ll want to start farming in order to purchase the two new order hall upgrades.
The first upgrade tier 7 costs 10,000 x Order Resources http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources and takes one day to research.
The second tier 8 costs 15,000 x Order Resources http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources and research completion will take 5 days.
You’ll also need Order Resources http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources for purchasing new artifact knowledge ranks which now caps at 40.


<hr>
flyingEarn the Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part One Achievement

Complete the first Broken Isles Pathfinder achievement so you can work towards Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Two once the patch is live.


As a recap, here’s what you’ll need to do to earn that first achievement:

Broken Isles Explorer http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11188-broken-isles-explorer - Explore the regions of the Broken Isles
Variety is the Spice of Life http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11189-variety-is-the-spice-of-life - Complete 100 different world quests
A Glorious Campaign http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/10994-a-glorious-campaign - Complete your class order hall campaign
Loremaster of Legion http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11157-loremaster-of-legion - Requires completion of all Legion zone achievements.

Good Suramaritan will be the most time consuming achievement though no longer gated and is the only one which requires a boss kill, Xavius in Emerald Nightmare for The Emerald Nightmare: The Stuff of Dreams. This quest can be completed on any raid difficulty including LFR.

Broken Isles Diplomat http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/10672-broken-isles-diplomat 

Earn Revered with The Wardens http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1894-the-wardens, Court of Farondis http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1900-court-of-farondis, The Dreamweavers http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1883-dreamweavers, Highmountain Tribe http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1828-highmountain-tribe, The Nightfallen http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1859-the-nightfallen and The Valarjar http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1948-valarjar



repMax Reputations to Exalted for the Paragon System

You're now able to keep earning reputation with a faction even after reaching Exalted.
For each 20,000 reputation earned past Exalted, you will earn a supply reward similar to those awarded by Emissary Quests.
These supply rewards have a chance to drop new, faction-exclusive mounts and toys.
After earning 10 of these rewards, you’ll earn the achievement Paragon of the Broken Isles http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11653-paragon-of-the-broken-isles.
You won’t be able to gain reputation from insignias earned from world quests, so there’s no point in holding onto those.


Here are the reward items you’ll have a chance to receive:

Cloudwing Hippogryph http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/147806-cloudwing-hippogryph from Farondis Chest http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146897-farondis-chest

championsLevel Class Hall Champions

Level all Class Hall Champions to 110 and cap their item level.
All Champions will now be able to reach Legendary quality, which unlocks a third equipment slot.
Once Legendary, Champions will not be able to earn any more experience.
You’ll be able to have one more active Champion, so make sure you have six Champions ready for missions.
Don’t forget that you can take Combat Ally Champions with you on world quests.



matsGather Materials for New Crafted BoE Legendary Items

The first crafted item level 940 Legendary items have been added.
These four items are Bind on Equipped and can be sold on the Auction House.
The new Legendary items and their required materials are as follows:

Celumbra, the Night's Dichotomy http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146666-celumbra-the-nights-dichotomy: Bolt of Shadowcloth http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146710-bolt-of-shadowcloth, Bolt of Starweave http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146711-bolt-of-starweave, Nethershard Essence http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146659-nethershard-essence, 65 x Blood of Sargeras http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/43534-blood-of-sargeras, 125 x Imbued Silkweave http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127004-imbued-silkweave, Sharp Spritethorn http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127681-sharp-spritethorn, Runic Catgut http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127037-runic-catgut

Not all of these items will be available prior to the patch, as many special new reagents have been added solely for these crafting specific items.
These legendary crafting materials are obtained through new quest chains.



sellSell Excess Gathered Materials Before Flying is Unlocked

Now that players will be able to fly, farming gathered materials such as herbs and minerals should be considerably easier than before.
Because of this, Auction House prices will likely fluctuate.
Consider selling any unneeded, stockpiled materials.
Hold onto materials that are used in crafting 7.2’s new BoE legendaries, including Stonehide Leather http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124113-stonehide-leather, Stormscale http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124115-stormscale, Felslate http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/123919-felslateand Leystone Ore http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/123918-leystone-orefor Demonsteel Bar http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124461-demonsteel-bar, and Shal’dorei Silk http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124437-shaldorei-silkfor Imbued Silkweave http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127004-imbued-silkweave.



petsLevel Battle Pets

Patch 7.2 introduces the first Pet Battle Dungeon, Wailing Critters http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/45423-wailing-critters.
You’ll need to be level 110 and have one level 25 pet for the one-time scenario, but it's ideal to have three level 25 pets.
You’ll need 15 max level pets for the Pet Battle Challenge: Wailing Caverns http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/45539-pet-battle-challenge-wailing-cavernsweekly scenario.



transmogCollect Transmog Items

Patch 7.2 adds a new “Sets” tab to the Appearances interface, so you can browse all item sets available to your character and see which items you are missing.
The interface will tell you where to get the items, so you can complete missing sets.
New achievements, such as Mogg-Saron http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11751-mogg-saron and Sha of Fabulous http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11757-sha-of-fabulous, have been added for collecting PVE and PVP item sets.

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/us-en.png Estimated US Rating Cutoffs for Legion Season 2
Over the last few PvP seasons, we’ve seen an increased request from the community for Blizzard to publish projected estimates of how much PvP rating a character will need in order to be awarded a title. We’ve been discussing the idea, and would like to give it a try.

IMPORTANT: What follows is purely an estimation based on current ladder rankings and participation. The final cutoffs will only be determined once Legion Season 2 has actually concluded, and have the potential to be significantly different than what is listed below due to a wide variety of factors. Meeting or exceeding one of these cutoffs does not in any way guarantee that you will receive that tier of rewards once the season has ended.

Estimated 3v3 Arena Cutoffs:


Fearless Gladiator Horde: 2820
Fearless Gladiator Alliance: 2780
Gladiator Horde: 2570
Gladiator Alliance: 2580
Duelist Horde: 2170
Duelist Alliance: 2170
Rival Horde: 1920
Rival Alliance: 1900
Challenger Horde: 1640
Challenger Alliance: 1630

Estimated Rated Battleground Cutoffs:

Hero of the Horde: 2500
Hero of the Alliance: 2530
Guardian of the Horde: 2190
Guardian of the Alliance: 2120
Defender of the Horde: 1910
Defender of the Alliance: 1870
Soldier of the Horde: 1670
Soldier of the Alliance: 1670


Remember, these are only a projection of what the final cutoffs could be based on current ladder standings.

These are not a guarantee of what will be finalized once the season has finished.
