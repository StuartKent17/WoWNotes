First off all, we want to thank all of you who have shown interest in testing WoW Classic. Having extra eyes on so many aspects of the game is a huge help as we prepare for the upcoming release.<br>
<br>
At this time, we&#x2019;ve finished sending out all of the invites for the first stress test (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-stress-test-1/178282). This large invite wave took a number of hours to process, so please check that thread for details about it and we&#x2019;ll see many of you there when the test begins later today. Also, don&#x2019;t forget that we have a couple more stress tests scheduled (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule), so keep an eye out for updates on those in the coming weeks.<br>
<br>
Related to this, we&#x2019;ve seen a lot of questions about the general invite process and want to clarify a few things. The method in which people are invited from the opt-in pool is not on a first-come-first-served basis, but instead we look at a variety of factors such as the age of the account. That said, the amount of closed beta invites that we&#x2019;re sending out is rapidly decreasing as we have met our current population needs for testing. We&#x2019;ll regularly reevaluate the need for additional invites as we go through the testing process.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your continued interest in WoW Classic and we can&#x2019;t wait to see you in Azeroth on August 27!</div></div>
