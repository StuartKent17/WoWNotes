Patch 5.3 - Heroic Scenario Group Requirement
The official notes have listed the group requirement for Heroic Scenarios for some time, but it was never actually in game until recently. Previously you were able to queue and get a random group to complete the scenario, but now you need 2 other players. 


  


Heroic Scenarios and Dungeons
We consider the entire forums all of them to be an opportunity for you all to share your ideas/constructive feedback etc. with us. We're always reading. It's also worth noting that Heroic Scenarios are a first go for us in giving players who want a bit more of a challenge within the Scenarios a way to get it. That said, that doesn't mean that these are the last "new" thing we'll ever add to the game. We're always looking at new ideas or concepts to push the gameplay within World of Warcraft further. We can't talk about all those ideas until we know we are able to make them work and are going to implement them or at least we try not to if we can, but that doesn't mean we aren't listening or planning on our end too.

I understand that many people would like new dungeons and we've addressed this a few times now, but at this point in time, we're not adding them. We have a lot of other things that we're putting efforts into that we think will be great additions to the game. Again, we're not ready to talk about those just yet, but once we can share that information with you all, we will. For now, we wanted to share a bit more about what the new Scenarios will bring.

If you haven't tried them on the PTR, you may just want to give it a shot. They're fun and add some great story elements as well.

Classes
Look at monk attack animations. The players' reward for doing their role correctly is that their screen looks beautiful. Cont
We are working long term on making rogue and warrior attacks cooler, since we agree that they look the most bland while fighting. Source 

Buttons bloat: are we in a good place now or some class still need less active abilities taking into account 5.3 PTR change?
I think just about every class has too many buttons. Source 

Out of curiosity, how do you internally measure when one healer is too weak or powerful then?
We try to look at the data lot of different ways: HPS during burst moments, dependence on mana CDs, synergy among healers, etc. Source 
If it was as simple as manipulating spec score or whatever, we could automate the entire balance process. Source 
People dedicate their lives to understanding large data sets. It's why I always say there isn't a "thermometer" for DPS. Source 
I don't mean to imply that data aren't useful -- they are! But you can't bubble up the data into a number that measures awesomeness. Source 
We also do a lot of internal tests too, because we have a lot more tools at our disposal than target dummies. Source 

How happy are you with the combo point style of resource management?
Happy. We think it's more interesting than cooldown-driven rotations. Source 

Since spec/stats/ilvl dictate survivability in PVP/PVE more than anything now, ever think about abolishing diff armor types?
As in mail vs. cloth? If anything, I wish that distinction was more meaningful. Source 

Would it be possible to make Divine protection usable for Holy Palas when stunned like PS, Barkskin and Life cocoon?
In general we don't like having lots of counters to counters. Source 
Stuns are intended to be scary. We'd rather nerf them than provide a ton of ways to mitigate or ignore them. Source

Damage adjustments to FeS and SS to discourage festerblight? Or just datamine error? Feel like its more of a trinket problem..
We're okay with Festerblight as a high risk moderate reward thing. There was a possibility it would be mandatory. Source 

Frost DKs are scaling very poorly. I know you hate this word but I'm sick of getting no response via twitter and no changes.
How much DPS are you failing to gain over the course of ToT because of ilevel scaling? 10%? 5%? 1%? Source 
If Frost DKs appear to be doing poorly it's probably because Unholy is a viable alternative now and lots are trying it. Source 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
5.3 hunter: Considering reverting the DR change on Scatter Shot but might nerf hunter pet CC cooldowns instead. Source 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Hey GC,What are your thoughts on Combustion? It is overly complicated to get the perfect ignite, & you're screwed if you fail.
What if you just went for a good Ignite instead of a perfect Ignite? Source 
We generally like having options for a lot of extra work for small rewards. Small keeps them staying optional. Source 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Agreed on Eternal Flame being a problem, but why no plans to adjust it in 5.3?
First, we agree with the supposition that the previous set bonus really propped up that healing style. Source 
Second, it would be a big change that would require some relearning on the part of paladins and rebalancing on the part of design. Source 
Better to try something on a 5.4 PTR, when there will be a lot of healers trying out new bosses compared to 5.3's quieter PTR. Source 

 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
attonement is a fail to the class in conjuntion with ToT Damange Increased bosses, must reconsider to delete this feature.
I don't understand why. Atonement is fun and useful. It's just a little OP at the moment even on non-damage buffed bosses. Source 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Rescinding one of my last tweets about PTR rogue ArP change. Will there be a tool tip saying 50%pvp?
There will be a 50% cap on Find Weakness in PvP, whether it's tooltipped or not. Source 

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Do you guys have plans on making Heroic leap usable up hills? Like leaping up a hill to peel seems pretty heroic yes?
It's just a technical limitation because people were leaping up walls and out of BGs. #thisiswhyyoucanthavenicethings Source 


<img src="" style="margin-bottom:-2px; margin-right:0px; vertical-align:bottom" /> Warlock Card Reveal: Void Terror
The new cards have already been added to the wiki !
In this Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft card reveal, we deal out a card that’s bound to make your enemies tremble and quake before you—the Void Terror.

The indomitable Warlock Gul’dan stops at nothing in his pursuit of power, and the whisper of his name strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies. Among all his devices of dread, one card in his arsenal is especially terrifying.

THIS CARD.

The Void Terror is able to absorb the minions next to him upon being summoned. Are you in control of a pair of feeble murlocs? Not anymore. Now you have a giant Void Terror. What happened to those night elves you had? Now they have become one with the void.

Void Terror can also help make your forces less vulnerable to Area of Effect AoE spells. Hellfire would cripple a deck filled with small minions....

Void Terror can help turn that army of puny minions into a huge, shadowy behemoth. That 3-damage blast of flame would barely faze your big blue demon on his path of destruction.

This minion really shines when you can convert single-turn, temporary effects like Power Overwhelming into a permanent bonus.

Give one of your puny minions a taste of SUPREME POWER, let him strike for a single, glorious attack, and then let the Void Terror suck his newly enhanced essence into his being. Don’t be sad, it was going to die anyway. In fact, a quick death in the Void is probably more pleasant than the alternative. Now that temporary +4/+4 bonus lives forever within the Void Terror!

When playing as Gul’dan, your role is not to care for the well-being of your minions. They are TOOLS for you to manipulate on your way to victory, and to be fed to the demons you’ll summon from the Void. Like any good tool, the purpose they serve is yours and yours alone.

I just wouldn’t get too close to this one if I were you. He looks hungry.
