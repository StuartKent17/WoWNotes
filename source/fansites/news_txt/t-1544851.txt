Blizzard just confirmed in a very short blue post that Auction House will be merged between Horde and Alliance in Warlords of Draenor. 
Hopefully it is. It would make life a lot more bearable as minority faction on an unbalanced server.
Yes, in 6.0 auction houses are unified between factions on a given server. The benefit you cite is a major reason behind the change.
