Patch 4.0.6 Hotfixes and 4.0.6a Changes - Feb. 11 (Updated)<br>
The list of hotfixes for today has been updated once again, new changes are in light blue. <br>
Here you&apos;ll find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the recently released World of Warcraft: Cataclysm patch 4.0.6. Hotfixes are updates we make on our end without requiring you to download a new patch. Some of the hotfixes below will go live the moment they are implemented, while others may require your realm to be restarted to go into effect. Please keep in mind that some issues cannot be addressed without a client-side patch update. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied. Visit our Bug Report forum for a list of 4.0.6 known issues.<br>
<br>
February 11 (Patch 4.0.6a)<br>
<br>
General<br>
<br>
Players are no longer encountering errors when having their items bid on in the Auction House. The Auctions tab also updates appropriately reflecting the bid.<br>
The South Island Iced Tea recipe no longer awards credit toward the Set the Oven to &quot;Cataclysmic&quot; or Time To Open A Restaurant guild achievements.<br>
Players can now Ignore other characters from different realms or battlegroups when queuing for Battlegrounds or dungeons using the command: /ignore playername-servername(region). Note that the user interface Ignore function and &quot;/ignore playername&quot; command still do not work correctly for players on different battlegroups and will require a future patch to correct.<br>
Releasing one&apos;s spirit after dying while on a transport or in a vehicle should no longer cause the player to disconnect.<br>

<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..druid) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1117-Druid-Cataclysm))<br>

<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..hunter) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1118-Hunter-Cataclysm))<br>
<br>
Auto Shot (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75/auto-shot/) was not firing while the hunter was moving under certain conditions. Auto Shot should now always function correctly while the hunter is moving.<br>
Having a melee weapon equipped no longer causes the tooltips for Cobra Shot (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77767/cobra-shot/) and Steady Shot (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/56641/steady-shot/) to incorrectly display extra benefit from haste.<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
The Quad Core (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/70747/quad-core/) buff provided by the Sanctified Bloodmage 4-piece set bonus is now properly removed as soon as a spell is cast if the mage does not have 4 pieces of the set equipped.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Beacon of Light no longer triggers from Light of Dawn.<br>
Glyph of Dazing Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/59560/glyph-of-dazing-shield/) correctly causes Avenger&apos;s Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31935/avengers-shield/) to daze the target, and only allows Avenger&apos;s Shield to trigger the dazed effect.<br>
The area-of-effect attack of Hammer of the Righteous (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53595/hammer-of-the-righteous/) no longer has a chance to miss secondary targets when the primary attack hits the paladin&apos;s target. If the primary attack of Hammer of the Righteous fails to hit the target due to miss/dodge/parry/block, no enemies will be affected by the area-of-effect attack. Rogues who are under Cloak of Shadows (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31224/cloak-of-shadows/), however, are able to resist this damage.<br>
The Warp Stalker ability Time Warp (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/35346/time-warp/) can no longer be used on paladins with the Divine Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/642/divine-shield/) buff active.<br>

<br>
Inner Focus (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/89485/inner-focus/) can no longer be cast before the effect of its preceding spell completes (Inner Focus will only be applied to spells that are cast after it).<br>
Shadow Power (Shadow priest passive) now increases Shadow damage by 15%, down from 25%. More information can be found here (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/157908/incoming-hotfixes).<br>
Sin and Punishment (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/87100/sin-and-punishment/) now works properly when two players of the same faction are fighting each other (including in Arenas). A string error may appear when the opponent is feared even though the talent functions correctly.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..rogue) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1122-Rogue-Cataclysm))<br>

<br>
Raging Blow has been reduced from 120% to 100% weapon damage at max level. More information can be found here (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/157908/incoming-hotfixes).<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br>
Bastion of Twilight<br>
<br>
The Elementium Monstrosity&apos;s health now more accurately reflects the state of the individual Ascendants.<br>
<br>
<br>

The health of Drakeadon Mongrels and Drakonid Slayers has been reduced in 10- and 25-player versions.<br>
Nefarian&apos;s (http://www.wowpedia.org/Nefarian_(Blackwing_Descent_tactics)) Blazing Inferno (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/76195/blazing-inferno/) damage and knockdown radius has been reduced to match the spell effect graphic.<br>
<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
Some Vicious Gladiator&apos;s weapons (item level 359) incorrectly had their costs increased. This has been corrected. Two-hand and ranged weapons now cost 3400 Conquest Points, while one-hand and caster weapons now cost 2450 Conquest Points.<br>
All Vicious Gladiator&apos;s weapons (item level 372) have been temporarily removed from the Glorious Conquest Quartermasters until the time is right to officially introduce them into Azerothian society.<br>
<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
<br>
Many items incorrectly rendered unusable in rated Battlegrounds and Arenas have been made usable again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Battlegrounds<br>
<br>
Players should no longer sometimes gets stuck in the world and unable to login upon completing a rated Battleground.<br>
Under certain conditions after queuing for Battlegrounds, players were still able to enter the Dungeon Finder queue. While this made it appear as though players were not actually queued properly for Battlegrounds, that wasn&apos;t the case. This issue has been fixed so that players cannot queue for both Battlegrounds and via the Dungeon Finder under these select circumstances.<br>
<br>
<br>
Battle for Gilneas<br>
<br>
The banners at each capture point now take 8 seconds to capture, up from 5. Note that when the banners are neutral and have not yet been captured by either faction at the start of a battle, they will display the wrong location names (Mine says Farm, Waterworks says Blacksmith, and Lighthouse says Stables).<br>
<br>
<br>
Races<br>
<br>
Gift of the Naaru (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/59544/gift-of-the-naaru/) now has a maximum limit to the amount healed when used on friendly NPCs with large amounts of health.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Exalted Title<br>
Recently we changed &apos;the Exalted&apos; title to require 50 exalted titles up from 40, which meant those that had achieved it were now asked to get 10 more reputations to gain the title back. We felt this kept the title as a difficult reward given the additional reputations introduced with Cataclysm, and also avoided the problem of achievement inflation as the game continues to grow, devaluing the reward.<br>
<br>
We didn&#x2019;t let people know beforehand that we were making this change. A pretty cut and dry error on our part. We take full responsibility for not communicating the change properly, and apologize for the frustration it added to the situation. Unfortunately, that frustration in some people&#x2019;s cases went to an extreme. Over the past couple days we&#x2019;ve handed out innumerable suspensions to people who were unable to stay within the forum code of conduct while posting about this change. We of course understand passions can run hot, but some of the violations were extreme enough to remove people&#x2019;s posting privileges permanently. It&#x2019;s unfortunate because rational, calm, and constructive posting is the type of feedback that&#x2019;s taken, discussed, and can help encourage real change. For those that were able to adhere to those posting ideals, we truly thank you for your efforts in keeping your cool.<br>
<br>
We took your constructive posts and points, and after discussing the change for quite a while with the designers, the decision has been made to move &#x2018;the Exalted&#x2019; title back to require 40 exalted reputations. We&#x2019;re going to attempt this change with a hotfix, but are unsure at this time if it will be able to be applied through a hotfix. It&#x2019;s possible that a client patch will be required. (We&#x2019;ll let you know if it does.)<br>
<br>
The 45 and 50 exalted reputation achievements will continue to exist, but for the time being won&#x2019;t provide anything beyond achievement points. As some have questioned why the title isn&#x2019;t grandfathered like &#x2018;the Loremaster&#x2019; or &#x2018;the Explorer&#x2019; titles, these function differently mechanically. While their requirements have changed, the actual achievement is the same. There&#x2019;s no tech currently that allows us to give a title for an achievement and then move that title to a different achievement altogether and have people keep them. We are however working on such a technology that will allow players to keep items or titles associated with achievements even if we decide to change that criteria. So, say if we eventually decide to move &#x2018;the Exalted&#x2019; title to an achievement which requires 60 reputations in the next expansion (just as an example), players who already earned the title at 40 reputations will get to keep the title when the criteria changes. This technology would allow us to let players keep titles or items they&#x2019;ve already earned, while ensuring we don&#x2019;t get stuck in a position where we have to continually generate new rewards just so those who earned them originally don&#x2019;t lose them.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for your feedback.<br>

Incoming Hotfixes (Updated)<br>
We&#x2019;re in the process of planning for a number of hotfixes that are intended to be implemented within the next day or two. To help give some heads up notice we&#x2019;re currently looking to make the following changes:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Shadow Power (Shadow priest passive) is being changed from 25% to 15% of Shadow damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Moonfury (Balance druid passive) is being changed from 15% to 6% Arcane and Nature damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Raging Blow reduced from 120% to 100% weapon damage at max level.<br>
<br>
<br>
In all three cases we&#x2019;ve been closely monitoring performance since the patch and all 3 specs are currently doing too much damage in PvE. In the case of Shadow and Fury we were also worried about their PvP burst potential, but didn&#x2019;t want to risk affecting them in PvE. Now that we have concluded they are too high in PvE, both aspects of the game should feel more balanced.<br>
<br>
We are also looking at nerfing Aimed Shot, but compensating hunters through Aspect of the Hawk. We are also likely to lower Arcane mage mana cost in some way, which will in turn buff their dps. These don&#x2019;t have those specifics just yet, but do keep an eye on the 4.0.6 hotfix blog for these and other changes as they come through.<br>
<br>
<br>
Blue Posts<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..deathknight) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1116-Death-Knight-Cataclysm))<br>
Chillbains &amp; Diminishing Returns / Frost Spec<br>
The root from the Chilblains talent being exempt from diminishing returns was a bug, which was resolved. In situations where shared diminishing returns are an issue, there are other tools available to Frost specced death knights to apply snares or otherwise close the gap. We think that death knight PvP mobility is in a good place now, but we&apos;re paying close attention.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re also keeping a close eye on Frost single target dps at the moment. On a related note, it looks like Frost area of effect output is competitive, despite the changes to Howling Blast. We&apos;re also pretty happy with the layout of the Frost tree in general. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/157847/proposed-dk-changes))</div></div>
