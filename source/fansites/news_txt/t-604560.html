2.4 Notes - when it&apos;s done<br>
This is your daily dose of 2.4 non-information, Blizzard is working on it but you won&apos;t know anything about it until the release.<br>
I think people would get tired of hearing &quot;not today&quot; and start asking &quot;when?&quot; Then I&apos;d have to answer with &quot;soon&quot; and it would just go on from there.<br>
<br>
Things are in the works, the cogs are moving, and we&apos;ll get there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Season 2 Gear available for honor<br>
For the moment, Blizzard still plan to make the season 2 gear available for honor once the season 4 has started. They also plan to simply remove the season 1 gear and if you&apos;ve got way too many honor points and like collecting things, you might want to buy it now. <br>
Q: With the launch of Season 3 for arena&apos;s, Season 1 gear became available for honor. My question is - when Season 4 starts, will Season 2 gear be available ... [for honor?]<br>
A: That&apos;s the plan Stan. (Subject to change)<br>
<br>
It means that Season 1 gear will no longer be available. Season 2 will take its place on the honor vendors for the same price that Season 1 gear is now.<br>
A: This is, also, the plan... Stan. Also not set in stone at the moment, but that&apos;s been the idea from the start. New season sets cycle in, the old ones are sloughed off.<br>
<br>
<br>
Warsong Gulch modifications<br>
Some of the matches played in Warsong Gulch are ridiculously long, and aren&apos;t really fun. Blizzard agrees and will try to change it in the future.<br>
We agree, and while it&apos;s nothing we could discuss now in any detail, there have been some different ideas tossed around and tested internally that would attempt to address those same concerns. Given that, these aren&apos;t changes that are likely to surface soon.<br>

European realms - Recent latency<br>
Thundgot posted another post on official forums about the high latency affecting some realms, especially in battlegrounds.<br>
Over the last few weeks, different issues have caused latency on some of our realms and cross-realm Battlegrounds (CRBGs), especially the Blackout, Bloodlust and Cataclysme Battlegroups. While most of the issues have already been resolved through our work with our service provider partners, we are aware that some latency issues are still affecting these Battlegroups, and to a lesser degree some other Battlegroups.<br>
<br>
We have implemented a workaround to alleviate some of the CRBG latency at peak hours and are working diligently on a permanent solution. We will update you on the matter as soon as we have new information available.<br>

What is your favorite 5 person dungeon from The Burning Crusade?<br>
There is a poll running on european forums asking players about their favorite 5-man instance. Caverns of Time instances are winning the poll by far, with respectively 42.05% and 19.51% for the Old Hillsbrad Foothills and The Black Morass, it&apos;s also interesting to see what are the instances that absolutely nobody wants to play (like the Auchenai Crypts). <br>
It could be the atmosphere, the story, the challenge or the loot itself, but no matter what everybody has a favourite dungeon. Of the 5 person dungeons released in The Burning Crusade what is your favourite?<br>

4. Auchindoun: Shadow Labyrinth (5,27%)<br>
5. Hellfire Citadel: Hellfire Ramparts (5,17%)<br>
