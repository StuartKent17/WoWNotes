Patch 5.4.8 - Valor Changes
There have been a few changes to Valor in Patch 5.4.8: 


Deeds of Valor http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/112353-deeds-of-valor is now sold by Mistweaver Ai http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/73305-mistweaver-ai for 3000 Timeless Coin http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/777-timeless-coin.
Heart of the Valorous http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/161795-heart-of-the-valorous was initially active for all characters when the PTR came up, but this no longer appears to be the case.
Legendary Cloaks http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-reqlvl-min=90&filter-quality=32 and Siege of Orgrimmar raid loot http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=17056&filter-found-in-raid-1=6738&filter-found-in-raid-2=-1&filter-reqlvl-min=90&filter-quality=16 are now upgradeable four times, up from two. Garrosh Heirloom weapons http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=17056&filter-reqlvl-min=90&filter-quality=128 have had their item level increased by 8.

Item Squish and Old Raids
Let me see if I got the question right, you want to know if a Level 90 soloing older Raid tiers will have as difficult a time post stat squish? 

There will be special handling in place for players to retain the ability to solo older raid content. Players will deal bonus damage against and take reduced damage from lower-level creatures from past expansions.

I thought the question was about raiding old content at the level they were intended for? BC at 70, WotLK at 80, etc. This is something I'd like to know too, as my guild does this.

Will the squish have an affect on that? From what I understand, gear increases within old expansions will be taken out, which kind of removes all progression. But I understand why you're doing it. Will this buff only appear at max level or will all players get it whenever they enter the raid? I'd like to know just so I can help plan how my guild's progression will pan out as WoD gets closer to release. 

I'd hate to have raiding old stuff at lower levels become impossible due to the item changes.
It's not a buff, more of a behind-the-scenes calculations type change. And running older raids with characters that are at the intended level ranges should still be possible post-squish.

it's rather disappointing that this is the only way of handling it. How do you reckon this will affect players who choose to twink at say level 60 or 70 or 80? If I at level 90 need a behind-the-scenes buff to be able to solo older content, how do you propose players will get achievements like Herald of the Titans?
Older raid content isn't intended to be soloable by characters at the appropriate level ranges. A level 70 character will not be able to solo Black Temple. But a level 90 character can do that currently, and will continue to be able to do so post stat squish.

Why is GCD capping a bad thing? I love playing WW monk exactly because it feels so button mashy. Fighting game-esque.
That's not necessarily tied to being GCD capped. GCD capping is bad because it makes energy not your primary resource. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464118948170956801
Thx! I like the chi/energy dance. Never have to stop mashing as long as I switch between those correctly. Will be preserved?

Blood Death knight's need empty GCD's to better react to gameplay? Why reduce player activity instead of allowing a skill gap?
Are those different things? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464228134317850624
Experienced Blood players understand incoming damage patterns, they should not need forced empty GCD's to save runes for burst.
But is the gameplay not better and more skillful if they have space to react? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464229028321189889
ct simply having nothing to do? Gameplay depth is not the issue, lack of activity is, players enjoy doing things!

Yours thoughts on Fire mage "rotation", being fairly bland and devoid of real decision making like Frost/Arcane has? Pre talents
A We disagree. B Post-talents is what matters, not pre-talents. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464218956232790016

I specifically mean blizzard, arcane explosion, and flamestrike
All should have useful, decent AoE. Having somewhat different/situational AoE strength is one part of spec differentiation. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464221686313656322
is it going to be harder than currently to switch spec for mages? from fire to arcane/frost the secondaries differ a lot
That's very intentional. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464222508590186496
but say, rogues/warlocks, secondaries are generally close enough that you can switch spec without nearly as much penalty
We want them to be closer, yes. But not exactly equal. And different specs favoring different stats is a good thing. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464222941031317504

No. Because they get rezzed in waves. Now lets have a look at the new picture and try to figure out what's different

Strongly considering a fixed resurrection time for Rated Battlegrounds in Warlords i.e. always 25 seconds instead of wave spawning. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463826196992499712
It's in place to prevent spawn camping for uncoordinated groups in normal battlegrounds. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463847775470247936
In rated battlegrounds, it often means winning a team fight doesn't matter due to a short res timer. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463848039354871809
Dislike. If there's graveyard camping in RBGs: it's the MMR system, not the res timer system.
this isn't to fix graveyard camping holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/464060385264300032
Won’t that make graveyard camping easier? One popping up at a time instead of an entire group? Turns it into wack a mole no?
Usually people die but the team fight goes on. People are much less spread out in Rated BGs. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463829740327927808
.it almost guarantees when one or two people die from your team that it's a for sure wipe. Having people on the same Rez is good
Counterpoint is that if a team wins a team fight, they actually win versus sometimes the 4 people they killed instantly return holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463852204189679616

Spawning in waves would remain in Normal Battlegrounds. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463828216507928577
That's cool, could the UI Map get a Timer on the gy rez? I've yet to find an addon that can track it. Maybe I need to look around.
It is intentionally not available to addons. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/464218343482724352

why would normal bgs still happen in waves?
In normal bgs, where things are very uncoordinated, it helps to resurrect alongside teammates. In RBGs, that isn't necessary. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/464094928511827968

I miss arena team names and arena team banners. Any plans to bring them back, maybe as a reward?
No plans but see the value holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/463920038160781312

Garrisons
Will there be a specific NPC that is the best blacksmith? Or will there be multiple blacksmiths that are all good?
Current plan is that follower level and quality will modify how much that blacksmith follower helps you out.
Some rare followers might have the coveted Level 2 mining trait, but they'll be difficult to find. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/463837273146916865
what is the difference between lvl 1 and 2 miners
More stuff generated per time note that this is all still in flux and will likely be simplified before ship Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/463874017149976578
