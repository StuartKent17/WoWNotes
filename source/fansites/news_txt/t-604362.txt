Boubouille2008-01-19, 04:05 AMA few interesting things today even if most of you will probably never get their hands on a TCG loot but it will be easier, read the post. Also, depending on how succesful I am during the weekend we might have something interesting next week. ^^

TCG - Servants of the Betrayer
The new expansion of the Trading Card Game - Servants of the Betrayer will be released soon, and Upper Deck finally posted the three loot cards available in it. That's not the only cool thing about it, it seems that the most common loot-card will be very, very easy to get, and we'll probably see supersized pets running everywhere a few days after the release. 

You can read the two articles here http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/wow/en/news/article.aspx?aid=3767 and here http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/wow/en/news/article.aspx?aid=3759 on UDE's site.

Papa Hummel's Old-Fashioned Pet Biscuit
Actually, the name of this item is the least cool part about it. In the MMO, when you redeem this item from Landro Longshot in Booty Bay, he’ll provide you with a stack of consumable biscuits. If you feed your cosmetic pet a biscuit, the pet will grow in size. Its final size will scale depending on the model of the pet, but a general reference is to the size of an average animal hunter pet.

Note about the rarity of this card
Servants of the Betrayer won’t have the standard common rarity MMO Loot item. Instead, it will be the first expansion to feature a super-common MMO Loot item. In March of the Legion, we made all the Loot items easier to collect, and we’re taking it a step further with the super-common Loot item in this set. 

How super-common is “super-common”? Let’s just say that every Servants of the Betrayer booster box is likely to have an MMO Loot card. Actually, that’s a half truth. Servants of the Betrayer booster boxes will likely come with two MMO Loot cards! Now that’s a bonus!

Uncommon Loot - Personalized Weather-Making Machine
The uncommon Loot item for Servants of the Betrayer is a Personalized Weather-Making Machine. An in-inventory clickable item, the weather-maker will generate a personalized weather graphic that appears over the user’s head.

The weather-maker will generate a number of different weather graphics, from sunbeams to thunderstorms. Wherever you go in Azeroth, the weather will be yours to command.

Rare Loot - X51 Rocket flying mount
Yes, the rare Loot item in Servants of the Betrayer is a rocket flying mount—the X-51 Nether-Rocket, to be precise. Yes, the rocket mount in the MMO will look just like the card art image http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/x51.jpg. 

The Nether-Rocket flying mount functions like standard flying mounts in the MMO. Like the Spectral Tiger, when you redeem the rocket code, you’ll have the ability to buy the rocket flying mount from Landro. You can buy the standard 60% speed increase version or the epic 280% speed increase version. Also like the tiger, your character will first need the appropriate riding skill before it can use the mount. You can choose to buy the standard version first and then return to Landro with the same code to buy the epic version.

Trash mobs in dungeons
Trash mobs are useful, seriously.
"Trash" mobs do serve a purpose in dungeons though and while they may not be your favorite part of the dungeon, we try and keep a good balance of it versus the rewards of the particular dungeon.

Shattered Halls may have a fair amount of trash, but I believe it can drop up to five badges of justice which is the most you can get from a heroic dungeon so it makes sense for it to be a challenge to get through.

Magtheridon, Onyxia, and Gruul's Lair are specific type of raid dungeons that are designed to be quick shots to the bosses and hopefully the loot.

For other raid dungeons, we generally shoot for a good balance of trash mobs to bosses but we do want these big epic dungeons to be challenging too. We never follow one static idea and continually aim to improve upon things and your suggestions are welcome here: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?forumId=11122&sid=1 http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?forumId=11122&sid=1

European battlegroup project
SK-Gaming http://www.sk-gaming.com/content/15525-European_Battlegroup_Project started an interesting initiative on european servers : building a competitive arena battlegroup to compete with the american Battlegroup 9. 

"Cyclone battlegroup 3 is the home of various top teams such as the European regional champions SK Warders and global finals runner up 4Kings Nashwan. Recently top teams such as Knockout, 4th place at the European regionals, world #1 2vs2 team druid/hunter Cherekee and Beasteh have migrated there as well, which makes more than a perfect reason for this to become the most competitive battlegroup in Europe. Many more teams and players have of course done this, but in order to make this THE battlegroup, we are willing to take an extra step.

Not only will this become the most fun battlegroup to play in, but at the end of each month we will be handing out prizes by Steelseries to the top 3 teams in each bracket, plus some extra prizes for the three highest ranked players all three brackets together. The first prizes will be handed out the last week of February, more details on that will be announced later."

You can read the full article on SK-Gaming.com http://www.sk-gaming.com/content/15525-European_Battlegroup_Project, a few good teams already started migrating and the first tournament is already scheduled ! http://www.sk-gaming.com/content/15540-Cyclone_Invitational_5vs5_Tournament
