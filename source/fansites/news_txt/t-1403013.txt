New World of Warcraft Pet: Alterac Brew Pup – 50% Benefits Make-A-Wish!

The Alterac Brew Pup  is a hardy friend who’s always ready to lend a paw or revitalizing swig of “good cheer” to anyone in need. Bred for rescue duty, the Alterac brewhound's bloodline is famous for having found and resuscitated many mountain travelers trapped beneath the snow . . . and then slobbering all over them. The most famous brewhound of all is Bernard, credited with saving upwards of 50 lives—many of them dwarf and orc soldiers dragged out of the snow beneath the treacherous bridges of Alterac Valley.
