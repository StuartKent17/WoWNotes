chaud2019-01-25, 07:58 PMFree T-Shirt Day Micro-Holiday on Patch 8.1.5 PTR
The Free T-Shirt Day https://ptr.wowdb.com/world-events/1053-free-t-shirt-day Micro-Holiday is now active on the PTR.


An NPC marked on your map with a rare mob icon wanders around either The Valley of Honor Orgrimmar or the Dwarven District Stormwind.
The NPC carries a t-shirt gun and periodically launches one. A t-shirt appears on the ground that becomes clickable https://ptr.wowdb.com/objects/310737-free-t-shirt.
Clicking the shirt gives you either:

A blue item called "Free T-Shirt" that visually removes the upper portions of your armor to expose the shirt you are wearing underneath. You can only use this item if you are wearing a shirt in the slot.
A variety of cosmetic shirts
