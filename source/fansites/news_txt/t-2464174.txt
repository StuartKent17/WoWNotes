The Free T-Shirt Day  Micro-Holiday is now active on the PTR.


An NPC marked on your map with a rare mob icon wanders around either The Valley of Honor Orgrimmar or the Dwarven District Stormwind.
The NPC carries a t-shirt gun and periodically launches one. A t-shirt appears on the ground that becomes clickable 
Clicking the shirt gives you either:

A blue item called "Free T-Shirt" that visually removes the upper portions of your armor to expose the shirt you are wearing underneath. You can only use this item if you are wearing a shirt in the slot.
A variety of cosmetic shirts
