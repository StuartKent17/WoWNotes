<img src="" style="margin-bottom:-2px; margin-right:0px; vertical-align:bottom" /> BlizzCon 2013 Storms Anaheim November 8-9 

PvP Season 12 Ending March 5
Arena and Rated Battleground Season 12 is scheduled to end on Tuesday, March 5. At that point, we will determine who is eligible for the end-of-season rewards, a process that should take approximately one week. It's very important for players who feel that they may be eligible for Arena titles and/or the Malevolent Gladiator's Cloud Serpent to refrain from transferring their characters to another realm or faction until after Season 12 ends. The awarding of Season 12 titles and mounts will occur approximately 2 weeks after the season ends.

At the end of the season, Conquest Points will be converted to Honor Points and any honor above 4000 will be converted to gold at a rate of 35 silver per point. The honor cap will remain at 4000.

All Season 12 items will cost Honor Points equivalent to their previous Conquest Point cost when the season ends, with the exception of any items with rating requirements attached. These items will no longer be available for purchase.

The next Arena and Rated Battleground season will begin approximately one week after the current season ends. During the break between seasons, all Rated Battleground and Arena matches will be unavailable. Team and Personal Ratings will be reset when Season 13 begins.


Raid Testing Schedule - February 20
On Wednesday, February 20, we will be testing more raid encounters in the Throne of Thunder.

Note that we will likely be doing 25-player Normal testing of many encounters on Thursday and Friday. I'll post a schedule for those tomorrow.

Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below for all Public Test Realms.

Wednesday, February 20

Horridon - 10 Player Heroic
10:30 PST 13:30 EST, 19:30 CET

Ji-Kun - 10 Player Heroic
13:30 PST 16:30 EST, 22:30 CET

Primordius - 10 Player Heroic
16:00 PST 19:00 EST, 01:00 CET

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback. 


PTR Class and Set Bonus Issues
Tuning Adjustments

These are in addition to any previous changes, unless specifically noted.
You can't just apply these to 5.1 numbers. You need to keep the entire suite of changes in mind. I say this because we always get a few players who only see -20% on some ability and get all "Don't nerf me, bro."
That said, feedback on these changes is always welcome. Numbers are more persuasive than feelings. PTR logs are better than simulations, since the latter are very dependent on the talent and time of the person doing the simming.


 Death Knight Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Might of the Frozen Wastes  to 20% melee damage, up from 10%.
Icy Talons  increases attack speed by 30%, up from 20%.
Blood Plague  and Frost Fever  damage +30%.
Howling Blast  damage to primary target +23%. Damage to secondary targets remains unchanged. Note: the tooltip for secondary damage says 0.5 but it has been 0.8 for some time.
Scourge Strike  damage +7.7%.


 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

We like our recent change to a lower cooldown on Avenging Wrath  for Retribution in PvP. We like it so much that we want to make it a baseline change for Retribution and not a set bonus, since many PvE paladins are benefiting from shorter wings today, and our recent DPS testing suggests that Ret needs a DPS buff. However, this does mean changing the existing T14 4pc PvE bonus. 


So the list of changes reads like this:

Retribution has a two minute cooldown on Avenging Wrath  baseline.
We are reverting the PvP set bonus change. The Retribution set bonuses remain as they are on live. This line will no longer appear in patch notes.
We are changing the T14 4pc PvE bonus to +10% damage on Seals and Judgment  We want you to graduate to the T15 set bonus fairly quickly and you won't be losing the shorter Avenging Wrath  cooldown.
Retribution damage was too low, but as I mentioned above, we buffed it through more frequent use of Avenging Wrath 


 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Envenom  damage +20%.
Dispatch  damage +15%.


 Priest Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Shadowform  increases damage by 25%, up from 20%.
We have heard some concerns that Atonement  damage is higher than intended, so we are checking that out, but no changes to announce yet.


 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Shamanism  increases Lightning Bolt  damage by 70%, up from 50%.
Elemental Focus  now increases spell damage by 15%, up from 10%.


 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Aimed Shot  damage +10%.
Chimera Shot  damage +50%.
Steady Shot  damage +20%.
Black Arrow  and Explosive Shot  damage +15%.
Hearing lots of concerns about Power Shot in PvP, so we may need a PvP-specific tweak there.


 Druid Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Rip  damage +15%.


 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Reduced damage of Bloodthirst , Colossus Smash  and Raging Blow  by 10%.
Yes this is a nerf in a sea of buffs, but the Bloodsurge  and Arms Deep Wounds  changes ended up being too much of a buff.


 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Hand of Gul'dan , Shadowflame, Shadow Bolt , Touch of Chaos and Wild Imp Firebolt +15%.
Soul Fire  damage +22%.
Conflagrate  and Immolate  damage +20%.
Incinerate  damage +10%.


For clarification, is the AoE aspect of Howling Blast  going to be increased by this 23% single target buff, or will the AoE coefficient be lowered to compensate?
Single-target buff. That's what I meant by damage to secondary targets remains the same.

However, in case it wasn't obvious, these were all single-target changes. We haven't completed AE, healing or tanking changes. Healing or tanking numbers look pretty solid overall though, so don't expect much change there. And feel free to disagree, but please provide some kind of evidence to back it up.

I want to play Unholy!
We buffed Unholy early on in the patch and I did mention disease and Scourge Strike  buffs as well.

You stated that shadow priest were overpowered in PVP and yet they received a 20% damage buff and now another 5% overall buff in Shadowform  how does that make any sense?
We're not convinced that Shadow's OPness in PvP came from overall damage. We think it is probably a combination of many things, and those we hit the hardest were healing and Phantasm  We did nerf the Mind Spike  glyph, which will reduce burst.

I'd imagine so since FnB is just a multiplier on the existing spells.
Correct.

Hand of Gul'dan , in metamorphasis form, is chaos wave. Does the 15% buff apply to the chaos wave too?
Yes.

Are there buffs designed to compensate for assassination getting less from the set bonuses?
Partially. This is a challenge for us, because we need to take the set bonuses into account, but everyone needs to function with the old set bonuses as well. We try to look at both situations.

Ret paladin damage will still be outclassed by other melee classes, causing us to be undervalued in the PvE scene, especially with the buffs to DK. 
We're not seeing Ret DPS below where we want it on live, except on AE or Cleave  fights, which these changes aren't targeted to correct. Again, as I mentioned above, you can't just take 5.1 numbers, mentally add these percentages to them and predict 5.2 numbers. I wish it was that easy, but a whole lot of things change. For example, we missed the mark on the current DK set bonuses, and they have been nerfed in 5.2.

Yeah, I'm thoroughly confused to the Fury nerfs after the MINOR buff to WS, a move that is used AFTER everything else.
Sorry, I brought too much focus to that one issue. Fury's DPS was just too high in 5.2 before these changes. It is a little high in 5.1 as well.
