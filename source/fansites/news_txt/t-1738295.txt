Bashiok let us know that the item level boost is expected to go out Wednesday. Keep in mind that isn't a guarantee.

Blizzard's logic for deploying this on a Wednesday instead of a Tuesday shows how out of touch with the game you guys are.
The logic is its not done yet, and providing lots of heads up let's people make the right choices. Bashiok https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578040982664413184
Make sure something is done and ready to go THEN announce it, instead of the other way around.. you can lawyer talk -- cont.
Giving people advanced warning isn't anything but positive. You know it's coming, so you can make the right choices. Bashiok https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578041446827081728
Thanks for the headsup. That said, really poor communication about the intended timeframe for this.
We said next week, and we intended for it to be sometime this week. Doesn't matter when it's applied. Bashiok https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578041585251659776
Except to the people who raid on Tuesday, I suppose.
Why? Bashiok https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578041870598582272
Kinda does matter to people raiding tonight...
Shouldn't really. Bashiok https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578042008473747456
Oh you're being serious, so you actually are crying over 5 iLevels. Gotcha.
Think his point is it's more the principal of the thing than ilvls. Bashiok https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578046622342361088
Ideally it could have been out this morning. It wasn't. Bashiok https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578046947161849856
For one week, on a few item levels. I think it's probably fine. Bashiok https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578047793949859840
Awful communication as well as releasing for European reset day & screwing over the United States in the process.
We're releasing when it's done. It's a somewhat complex change. Bashiok https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578046947161849856
any eta on the time this will be live tomorrow?
No. When it's ready. I would personally suspect afternoon. Bashiok https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578047423848718336

I don't think some passives should be baked into active abilities. It hides how a spec works and newbies constanly overlook it
This is definitely a point of confusion for some players that we will be taking a hard look at changing. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/575385560832811009

Moonkin Wild Charge Disengage not usable out of combat. Design or oversight?
Original design. It was an oversight not to change this when we changed Disengage. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/575385273091026945

Art
Hey lots of helms that cover the face are now broken on human females because of the 6.1 changes. Any plans to fix it?
Art is constantly looking to improve helm fitting. Bug reports with specific examples/screenshots if possible always welcome. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/575431807904043008

PvP
Regardless, may we assume that you've seen the mountains of criticism regarding the Ashran changes? You discussing more changes?
I made a forum post elaborating on the reasons for the change and our thoughts on the matter have not changed. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574915532626919424

Some feedback about bag space some pvp related http://t.co/axl10JB1DQ
Yea we tried to reduce the amount of items you get from ashran. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574926136620118016

Constructive feedback on how to get more people into pvp. Really a great thread http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16542424647?page=1. 
I certainly agree personally with the premise that nurturing "bad" players is important for a game overall holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575102845214556160

Why is Arcane Power is dispellable and paladin's wings are not? I remember them being dispellable.
Avenging Wrath used to be dispellable, but dispelling it was too punishing. No promises, but we can discuss the same for AP. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/575384986213183488

Misc
Is there a reason stopped answering questions and just used as an announcer of hotfixes/changes now?
We haven't stopped and we're gathering a bunch right now. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/575367713087877120

Okay can you tell us who Gul'dan's voice actor is? Because that dude is amazing.
Troy Baker! He's great isn't he? Great to work with, too! DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/575343611321020416

Thanks for the feedback and for presenting it reasonably. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/570775057150009344
While his initial tweet could use some work, I don't think your sarcasm is going to work for you in the long run.
it wasn't sarcasm. It was genuine thanks. His tweet was good feedback. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574907099945177089
Your answers are either terrible and sarcastic or twitter sucks as a way to communicate with you.
Twitter isn't a great for communicating tone. I'm surprised people think this tweet is bad. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574907544960811008
Also to be fair the person I responded to was never unreasonable. Third parties decided it was sarcasm. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574911933272363008
Ever think that it might be time to give up twitter completely? Not saying you should, nor would I feel compelled to. Just asking.
No because 99% of people on here are great holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574922024566583296
True story. We don't let the few bad eggs get us down. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/574922357220864002

Apparently this is a mean spirited sarcastic tweet on my part. If this is the worst I ever do I'm succeeding. http://t.co/hUEE1u6YxK holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574909794236002304
if you think a tweet is the worst you do, try Ashran ;-

Guild Wars 2 is getting some camera improvements in this week's patch. Among the changes are first person mode and a new collision detection system. You can see an example of how the changes affect your view here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3t4iDDj-qw&t=376. Running past trees or other small things no longer zooms your camera in all the way.
