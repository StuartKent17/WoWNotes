Item Level Boost Wednesday
Bashiok let us know that the item level boost is expected to go out Wednesday. Keep in mind that isn't a guarantee. 


  

Blizzard's logic for deploying this on a Wednesday instead of a Tuesday shows how out of touch with the game you guys are.
The logic is its not done yet, and providing lots of heads up let's people make the right choices. Bashiok 
Make sure something is done and ready to go THEN announce it, instead of the other way around.. you can lawyer talk -- cont.
Giving people advanced warning isn't anything but positive. You know it's coming, so you can make the right choices. Bashiok 
Thanks for the headsup. That said, really poor communication about the intended timeframe for this.
We said next week, and we intended for it to be sometime this week. Doesn't matter when it's applied. Bashiok 
Except to the people who raid on Tuesday, I suppose.
Why? Bashiok 
Kinda does matter to people raiding tonight...
Shouldn't really. Bashiok 
Oh you're being serious, so you actually are crying over 5 iLevels. Gotcha.
Think his point is it's more the principal of the thing than ilvls. Bashiok 
Ideally it could have been out this morning. It wasn't. Bashiok 
For one week, on a few item levels. I think it's probably fine. Bashiok 
Awful communication as well as releasing for European reset day & screwing over the United States in the process.
We're releasing when it's done. It's a somewhat complex change. Bashiok 
any eta on the time this will be live tomorrow?
No. When it's ready. I would personally suspect afternoon. Bashiok

I don't think some passives should be baked into active abilities. It hides how a spec works and newbies constanly overlook it
This is definitely a point of confusion for some players that we will be taking a hard look at changing. WarcraftDevs 

 Druid Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 
Moonkin Wild Charge Disengage not usable out of combat. Design or oversight?
Original design. It was an oversight not to change this when we changed Disengage. WarcraftDevs 

Art
Hey lots of helms that cover the face are now broken on human females because of the 6.1 changes. Any plans to fix it?
Art is constantly looking to improve helm fitting. Bug reports with specific examples/screenshots if possible always welcome. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
Regardless, may we assume that you've seen the mountains of criticism regarding the Ashran changes? You discussing more changes?
I made a forum post elaborating on the reasons for the change and our thoughts on the matter have not changed. holinka 

Some feedback about bag space some pvp related 
Yea we tried to reduce the amount of items you get from ashran. holinka 

Constructive feedback on how to get more people into pvp. Really a great thread  
I certainly agree personally with the premise that nurturing "bad" players is important for a game overall holinka 

Why is Arcane Power is dispellable and paladin's wings are not? I remember them being dispellable.
Avenging Wrath used to be dispellable, but dispelling it was too punishing. No promises, but we can discuss the same for AP. WarcraftDevs 

Misc
Is there a reason stopped answering questions and just used as an announcer of hotfixes/changes now?
We haven't stopped and we're gathering a bunch right now. WarcraftDevs 

Okay can you tell us who Gul'dan's voice actor is? Because that dude is amazing.
Troy Baker! He's great isn't he? Great to work with, too! DaveKosak 

Thanks for the feedback and for presenting it reasonably. holinka 
While his initial tweet could use some work, I don't think your sarcasm is going to work for you in the long run.
it wasn't sarcasm. It was genuine thanks. His tweet was good feedback. holinka 
Your answers are either terrible and sarcastic or twitter sucks as a way to communicate with you.
Twitter isn't a great for communicating tone. I'm surprised people think this tweet is bad. holinka 
Also to be fair the person I responded to was never unreasonable. Third parties decided it was sarcasm. holinka 
Ever think that it might be time to give up twitter completely? Not saying you should, nor would I feel compelled to. Just asking.
No because 99% of people on here are great holinka 
True story. We don't let the few bad eggs get us down. Celestalon 

Apparently this is a mean spirited sarcastic tweet on my part. If this is the worst I ever do I'm succeeding.  holinka 
if you think a tweet is the worst you do, try Ashran ;-
oh zing holinka
