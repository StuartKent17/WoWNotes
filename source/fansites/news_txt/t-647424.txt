Today we've got another update to Algalon's Loot Table, but this one is definitely strange. With the recent hotfixes to Ulduar a lot of guilds managed to kill the Iron Council and Hodir in hard mode and two new items were discovered. 

Constellus http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/may/constellus.jpg 1H-Mace - Spell MP5 dropped from Hodir in Hard Mode.
Fang of Oblivion http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/may/fangofoblivion.jpg 1H Dagger - Phys.DPS dropped from the Iron Council in Hard Mode.

None of these items were discovered on PTRs where the Iron Council and Hodir hard modes were killed by tons of guilds and they weren't part of the official armory update that included all the loot tables from all the bosses except Algalon. According to their itemID, and if the two item drops mentionned above aren't a bug, we can assume that Algalon will share a part of his loot table with regular bosses.

WoW Insider interviews Tom Chilton on Patch 3.1 and beyond
WoWInsider http://www.wowinsider.com/2009/05/05/wow-insider-interviews-tom-chilton-on-3-1-and-beyond/ had a chance to talk with Tom Chilton Kalgan about Patch 3.1 and everything we can expect after that.

The Argent Tournament will be expanded in Patch 3.2 and will be the biggest feature of the patch
A new battleground will be added to the game in Patch 3.2
New dances and druid forms are still in the work
More hero classes are definitely possible in the future but Blizzard is being very careful about them and don't want to go too far too quickly.
Dual-spec is a nice idea but Tri-spec most likely won't happen
Housing is an awesome feature on other MMOs but developers aren't sure if it would be a good thing for WoW in the long run. It might happen in the future but it's definitely not a priority.
