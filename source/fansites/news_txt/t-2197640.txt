chaud2017-04-06, 02:10 AMLegion Assaults Removed from Pathfinder
We’ve heard a lot of feedback and it’s clear to us that the cyclical Assaults schedule, and the design of the “do all 4” achievement for Pathfinder, weren’t compatible.

World Quests come and go all the time during the day too, while people are at work or asleep, and it’s not a big deal because they’re largely interchangeable. But that would change if we had an achievement required for Pathfinder that asked you to do a specific checklist of world quests. A lot of the stress and concern about “missing” individual Assaults is tied to this achievement, so we’re removing the achievement from Pathfinder via hotfix.

Once this hotfix is active, you will only need to reach Revered with the Armies of Legionfall and fully explore the Broken Shore to earn Legion flying.


Patch 7.2 Hotfixes - April 5
Achievements

The "Defender of the Broken Isles" achievement is no longer required as part of the Legion Pathfinder, Part Two meta-achievement.


Developers’ notes: The rotating Legion Assault schedule is designed to have them active at varying times of day over the course of a given week, to accommodate different work schedules and available free time. We're hesitant to have an Assault last for too long, because they stomp on the entire World Quest content of a given zone for the duration, potentially leaving players with nothing to do there once the Assault is complete. But this design doesn't mesh well with an important achievement that requires completion of all four zones - if anything, it causes stress over scheduling and potentially missing specific zones during the cycle. The Defender achievement was never intended to be a major obstacle on the path to flight in the Broken Isles; its inclusion was more for thematic purposes and completeness. As such, we're removing it from the meta-achievement required to unlock flying.

Artifact Challenges

Arcane Mages can no longer use an immunity, such as Ice Block, to remove Arcane Biology.
Fixed a bug that was preventing some players from being ported back to the mage tower when leaving the scenario.


Assaults

While the Assault in Azsuna is active, Prince Farondis should now be visible to eligible players in Farondale.
Vile Soulwardens in Val'sharah are no longer hesitant to engage in combat.
Spires of Dread can no longer suffer damage from players' AoE abilities, and they no longer turn to face nearby players.
Jarod Shadowsong will now appear for players at the base of Black Rook Hold if they leave the terrace before completing "Battle for Val'sharah".
Drol'maz will now respawn even if his Dark Ritualists were not killed with him.
Destruction of Fel Spreaders will now grant group credit for “Defense of Emerald Bay”.
Fixed a bug where players were not receiving quest credit if they were in a raid group during the intro Legion Assault quests.


Broken Shore

The Sentinax should no longer advertise that it is finished recharging when it hasn't.

Upcoming change to Legionfall War Supplies
One of the core mechanics of Broken Shore gameplay is that of acquiring Legionfall War Supplies to put towards constructing buildings, which in turn unlock various content and bonuses. Recently, we’ve begun to notice that some players have begun stockpiling their Legionfall War Supplies in order to use them at a later time. While this is fine to some degree, if it were to become a more widespread behavior, it could have severely negative effects on the rate at which buildings are constructed, thereby preventing those bonuses and content pieces from being made available.

Therefore, on Thursday, April 6 at roughly 11 AM Pacific time, we’ll be applying a hotfix that will reduce the maximum amount of Legionfall War Supplies a player can stockpile to 1000. This will ensure that building construction can proceed at a regular pace, while still allowing you to keep hold of several turn-ins worth of War Supplies if you like.

Note that, when this hotfix is applied, any Legionfall War Supplies you have over the cap of 1000 will be lost. If you’re currently carrying more than that, please make sure to turn those extra War Supplies in before Thursday.

going to be disappointed if I waste some of the effect on DoT overlap if this does stack.
Clarification: Purifying Brew will increase the direct damage of your next Breath of Fire by 50%. We don't want to beg the question of how the DoT interacts with mixing buffed/unbuffed BoFs.

EDIT: And you will be able to Purify without any Stagger, to be clear.

Usually, we don't discuss changes so early in the design process, but decided to try it out here. That's why I've focused so much on our thoughts and intent, not the exact changes we're planning, because planned changes are so ephemeral. 

Our design process is extremely iterative. We start with something and tweak it until it's as good as we can get. That means it starts out pretty rough, and solidifies over time into something better, and this discussion is a perfect example of what it looks like to peak into that process.

Continuing this iteration process, listening to your feedback, and lots of internal discussion and testing, we're now leaning toward removing the Stagger cap. To be perfectly accurate, changing it to an obscenely large value so that it still functions as exploit prevention. If you can get to 1000% Stagger... sorry, that's probably enough.

So there is basically two ways to "nerf" our ISB uptime.
Nerfing Ironskin Brew uptime is explicitly not a goal of these changes. We have no current intention to do that. 100% uptime of ISB is totally fine right now.
