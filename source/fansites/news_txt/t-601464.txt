Boubouille2007-07-03, 05:20 PMSome changes will be made on the site in the next minutes/hour. Some pages will be very slow to load if you're the first one lucky you ! to load them. Some pages will probably be bugged to hell, I'll try to fix them as soon as possible. 

Of course, I could do this on the test version of the site, but it wouldn't be fun. 

Final update : I'll fix the few bugged itemlinks, the enchantment list and the jewelcraft list will be fixed a bit later. but not too much later
