I had to rush the video a little because of the official preview posted a few hours ago but ... here it is, a fairly complete preview of the Icecrown Citadel, the raid instance introduced with patch 3.3.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that some of the monsters and objects are missing and the instance will look nicer on live servers.<br>

Note on the Frozen Throne - The Frozen Throne is also obviously a work in progress. If you think that the area looks small I would also like to point out that during the Blizzcon, developers clearly said that some of the floor would collapse during the fight. Destructible objects can&apos;t be displayed in the video and it will most likely look VERY different when you finally get a chance to meet Arthas.<br>
