A &quot;bat-themed&quot; armor set for rogues seems like a no-brainer, but we were careful to skirt the more obvious inspirations. World of Warcraft often makes playful references to pop culture, but it&#x2019;s important -- particularly with player gear -- that what we create has integrity within our universe. Rogues look good in close-fitting masks, collars, and cowls rather than elaborate armored helms. It also helps reinforce the rogue&apos;s sneaky silhouette if the shoulder pads have a streamlined shape... even if that shape has sharp, bladed details.<br>
