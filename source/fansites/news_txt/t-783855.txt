Boubouille2010-11-01, 10:12 AMDigital Download Rumors
I got a crazy amount of mails from players concerned about the digital download version of Cataclysm. Someone pointed out that a post on the customer support forum  mentions that pre-rendered cinematic are not part of the digital download anymore. 

I usually do not comment that kind of stuff, but I would like to point out that people are going crazy over a post made 2 weeks before the sale of the Cataclysm digital download started and things are very different in this case. There aren't any official confirmations that the cinematics will not be part of the Cataclysm digital download and I strongly suggest that you all wait for a blue reply, I really don't see Blizzard slapping a huge % of their playerbase in the face by not including cinematics in the Cataclysm client. 

This is most likely just a bug and we will probably have an official post about that very soon.

Cataclysm Models - Therazane
I forgot to post this model a while back, Therazane the Stonemother  got her own unique model in Cataclysm and it's ridiculously awesome.


   


Cataclysm - Capital Cities Quartermasters
With the expansion, Capital Cities will finally have their own quartermasters and rewards! Don't get too excited, they're only low level rewards, but some of you will probably like the idea of having a set of tabard/cloak with the emblem of your faction. 

Each quartermaster offers:

A faction tabard, these tabards finally allow you to level your capital cities reputations in instances. eg. Darnassus Tabard 
3 Low level cloaks eg. Cape of Darnassus , Mantle of Darnassus , Shroud of Darnassus 
A 16-slot bag eg. Darnassian Satchel

Armor Penetration
Armor penetration as a concept is not overpowered. We're not worried about Sunder Armor for example. Armor penetration as a stat was overpowered. There was no reasonable mathematical way for us to prevent armor pen rating on gear from just being better and better the more you stack, which has a number of problems, such as making other stats unattractive and making a dude with a lot of armor pen overpowered.

PvP Damage
Some of those numbers have already come down. If you recall, Fury dps was low with the patch, so we buffed it, knowing that we would have to nerf it again to keep it under control at 85, especially with Colossus Smash and Deep Wounds. Ret had a similar issue with Inquisition.

We definitely want to increase survival time in PvP relative to what it was in Lich King. We are considering increasing resilience at 85 or even bumping health pools across the board even more. Source

Vanish in Cataclysm
The purpose of Vanish in Cataclysm is to get back into stealth. If you want to avoid harmful effects, use Cloak of Shadows.

We grew tired, as did many players, of "Vanish never works LOL" so we looped back to the original intent of Vanish being about stealth. That is why the tooltip specifically says that harmful effects won't break Vanish, but does *not* say that the harmful effects won't land. We understand some rogues liked using Vanish to "dodge spells" but the ability was never designed to work that way and never was going to work that way very well. The more we tried to let it be a damage negater, the harder time we had letting it guarantee stealth.

There is a current live bug with pets and guardians being able to still target a vanished rouge. That will be fixed in an upcoming patch. Other than that, we are not aware of any issues that keep the ability from working as advertised. Most concerns seems to be rogues who want it to work a different way. Source

Colossus Smash
The origin behind Colossus Smash was that we realized warriors were at a disadvantage against heavily armored targets because they do no magic damage. We also wanted to put something in their rotation that was more than just another +weapon damage or +AP attack. Finally, we wanted to replace Execute in the Sudden Death talent, since that was keeping Execute's damage low, instead of it feeling like a powerful finisher. Source
