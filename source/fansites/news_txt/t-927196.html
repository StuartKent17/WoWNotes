Patch 4.2 - Patch Notes Update<br>
Blizzard posted what seems to be the final version of the Rage of the Firelands Patch 4.2 Notes and added RAF to 80, removed the Move Pad feature (moving your character with the mouse only), and clarified the starting conditions of the Legendary Quest.<br>
General<br>
Recruit-A-Friend now awards bonus experience and free level grants to level 80, up from level 60.<br>
<br>
Interface<br>
Move Pad is a mouse-click interface for movement which is now built into the base interface.<br>

Legendary Item - Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa&apos;s Rest<br>
Steadfast raiders have an opportunity to embark on a series of quests to create an all-new legendary caster staff. In order to begin the process of assembling the staff, players must first kill a Molten Lord in the Firelands, or have completed any of the achievements Bastion of Twilight, Blackwing Descent, or Throne of the Four Winds. Once any of these achievements have been unlocked, players can accept the quest A Legendary Engagement from Ziradormi in Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar, or Coridormi atop the Wizard&apos;s Sanctum in Stormwind (players who have already completed any of these achievements are immediately eligible for this quest). Players who become eligible for the quest series by killing a Molten Lord in the Firelands will automatically receive the quest Your Time Has Come, leading them to the start of the questline. The legendary item questline is only available to druids, mages, priests, shaman, and warlocks.<br>
