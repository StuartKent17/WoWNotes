Warcry posted their preview  of Zul'aman. Nothing really new but there are still some informations I may have missed them in previous interviews
The 4 Animal Gods will be : Nalorakk Bear, Lynx Halazzi, Dragonhawk Jan'Alai and Eagle Akil'Zon.
The 2 other bosses will be Jin'zakk  and Zul'jin 'jin Final Boss
The dungeon is splitted in 4 wings. You should be able to complete each wing within an hour with a decent group. 
Blizzard is working on something called "Logical loot". Previously, the loot tables were somewhat random. They're not going back and fixing years of content, but now, players can expect creatures to drop things that one would expect. If that bad guy is holding a big, shiny axe, then odds are his loot is a big shiny axe.

Epic mounts
This information won't have any impact on the game before 6 months, but maybe it will make some poor people happy. Epic mounts price might drop, later, maybe. 
Depending on how mount riding skills are going to progress, the most likely point for a price drop would be with the release of the next expansion, just as the ground mount prices dropped when Burning Crusade was released. Again it would likely depend on a few factors, and may actually not change. But that's a question for a later time.
