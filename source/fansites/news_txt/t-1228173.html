Heroic Terrace of Endless Spring Progression Update<br>
Terrace of Endless Spring is close to being cleared, with the first three bosses already down by Blood Legion (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/illidan/Blood+Legion). Vodka (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/alterac-mountains/vodka) is in second place with 2/4 defeated, and Exodus (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/cho-gall/Exodus) is in third place with 1/4.<br>
<br>
Don&apos;t forget that the LFR version of Terrace of Endless Spring is now open! You can find guides for all of the bosses on Icy Veins (http://www.icy-veins.com/terrace-of-endless-spring-raid-wow).<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
Patch 5.1<br>
Where is our unique anglers tabard, and where are our other water strider colors? <br>
Anglers tabard is a bug. We&apos;ll fix. Not sure we ever intended to make other striders available. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/263072257755209729))<br>
<br>
Questing<br>
Remove class specific quest rewards? When none of the items are an upgrade, I would always chose the one that sells for most <br>
Okay, weapon costs still vary. We made all armor types the same cost. It used to be, you were dumb not to choose the plate one. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/262970910032666625))<br>
<br>
World<br>
Isn&apos;t the fact that the fans want flying on silvermoon enough justification to do it? Will it ever get done or r u sayin never <br>
Say you were the game director on WoW. Would you spend art time on Silvermoon or a new raid? Not saying there&apos;s a right answer. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/262971103834689536))<br>
<br>
Draenei are the SINGLE most neglected race in the entire game. Even Forest Song didn&apos;t get a single upgrade. <br>
I don&apos;t know who is the &quot;most neglected&quot; but we have plans for Draenei. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/262733725148798976))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
Is it possible to make tab-targeting target the closest enemy in front of you instead of every totem, pet, critter and tree? <br>
Gotten that request a lot lately. We&apos;ll look at it. Could also do a mod-tab or something. <br>
<br>
Are the other members of SI:7 in Jade Forest dead? (ie, Amber Kearnen) Loved Amber. <br>
I believe Amber survived.<br>
<br>
Oh and where is my bat mount? Bats have been taxis forever and it&apos;s still not a mount. Hook a forsaken up! <br>
We need a better looking bat model, but after that, for sure. <br>
<br>
&quot;We are concerned about how money will we still get from servers transfers&quot; There, i fixed that for you. <br>
Nah. It&apos;s better business to have the game endure a long time because players like it than to make a quick buck. <br>
<br>
Can you talk about possible reasons why you would not allow a choice between old and new player models? <br>
We might. That would be a good way to reduce the &quot;looks great but not my guy&quot; factor. <br>
<br>
Speaking of which, what&apos;s your opinion on &quot;datamining&quot;? Is it a good thing or just something you&apos;re forced to live with? <br>
Probably good overall. I wish players didn&apos;t accept it as truth. The miners usually caveat everything pretty well. <br>
<br>
Did you ever expect so many guilds to make optional addons &quot;mandatory&quot; parts of joining/playing the game? <br>
I would not have predicted that players would become so focused on efficiency. Not fun or improving themselves. Efficiency. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261362197857456128))<br>
<br>
Will upgrading gear though valor points be added in 5.1? Or will it be added later? <br>
The plan is 5.1. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261360678206590976))<br>
<br>
Why don&apos;t you go with smaller and more consistent patches? It feels like you need to be able to monitor changes btr? <br>
Informed players (like many of you) might prefer that, but for many players it feels like near constant class design churn. <br>
Is there a problem with that honestly? The quicker its tuned, the faster balance approaches, its how it works <br>
Believe it or not, a lot of players quit playing if we&apos;re in a state of always tuning classes, even if better balance is achieved. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261361561648656384))<br>
<br>
Is there any chance of the Motes/Spirits of Harmony becoming BoA in the future? <br>
Perhaps in a future patch. We like the way they are playing for now. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261149962644107264))<br>
<br>
What is going on with revamped character models ,having a hard time finding a blue post on forums <br>
We&apos;ve said we&apos;re working on it, but it&apos;s a huge task with a lot of risk so it won&apos;t be anytime soon. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/260776065977446400))<br>
<br>
How about a search feature for the mount tab similar to non-combat pet tab, purdy please? <br>
Yeah, we&apos;ll do one. <br>
<br>
But arthas death is still a bit unresolved, whats up?<br>
Unresolved? Dead as a doornail. (Source (https://twitter.com/ChrisMetzen/status/260421632307372032))<br>
I think what he means by &quot;unresolved&quot; is the whole &quot;where is his body&quot;<br>
I know - I was dodging. (Source (https://twitter.com/ChrisMetzen/status/260425292479332352))<br>
<br>
Can you explain what &quot;High King&quot; really means? Does it mean Varian is above the other leaders, or something else? <br>
Much like the &quot;Warchief&quot; of the Horde, the High King is trying to coordinate the actions of all the races in the Alliance. <br>
<br>
Why can&apos;t I put my herbalism spade in my herb bag? My fishing rod goes in my fishing bag.<br>
Great point! It has now been fixed for 5.1! <br>
