ixzo (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/749667-ixzo) was able to unlock (http://imgur.com/a/hITPZ) the Outlaw Rogue hidden artifact appearance! There are still some unclear details, but the process appears to be:<br>

What was the design philosophy behind the elite area of Suramar? It&apos;s super frustrating, even with a group.<br>
Agreed the spawning is too dense right now, but it&apos;s meant as a group combat area. Lots of Group Finder parties for WQs there. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/780103230265044992))</div></div>
