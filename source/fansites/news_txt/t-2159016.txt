Patch 7.2 - Artifact Power
As many of you have noted, Patch 7.2 will be introducing several new traits to Artifact Weapons. We'd like to clarify how these traits will unlock so that you can best prepare for them.

After Patch 7.2 is available, players who have an Artifact Weapon of at least rank 35 will be able to further empower that Artifact through a short quest chain. Completing this quest chain will consume any ranks beyond 35, increase the overall power of your Artifact Weapon to ensure that losing ranks 35+ isn’t a downgrade, and unlock access to the new 7.2 traits. Any Artifact Power spent on traits beyond 35 will be refunded and you’ll immediately be able to spend that refunded Artifact Power on the new traits.

Note that any Artifact Power tokens acquired before Patch 7.2 will not be usable on an Artifact Weapon that has had its new traits unlocked. If you’ve already reached Rank 54, feel free to use any tokens you earn between now and then on alternate specs; there is no need to stockpile those tokens for Patch 7.2. We’re also planning to apply a hotfix in the near future that will allow the current Artifact Power tokens to be sold to vendors. 

Please feel free to add any feedback, questions or thoughts to this thread.

Patch 7.2 - New Artifact Traits
Yeah, the new traits aren't accessible yet. Hope is to have them available next week. There's a short quest chain involved to unlock them, which is currently disabled. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Patch 7.2 - Honor Requirement for Prestige 1
Thanks for the post. To address one issue you mentioned, in 7.2, we're reducing the amount of honor it requires to go from Honor Level 1 to 50 before prestiging the first time aka Prestige 0. It will take roughly half the amount of honor as it does now. Prestige ranks 1 and higher will remain the same. 

Hopefully, this helps everyone gain access to their honor talents faster. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

PSA: Be Careful with your Essences
Quick update here from the development team. The quest is currently working as intended, and any essences over the limit will continue to be reset, as is normal quest function.

It's worth noting that this quest was designed to be able to be completed without too much time spent on it, so we don't see it necessary to adjust the quest to account for min-maxing.

TL;DR: If you're worried about going over your 50/50 limit, keep an eye on your Essences going forward! Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Patch 7.2 - Invasion Quests
All good feedback and thank you for it!

Current thinking on iteration is to modify the requirements of the cover quest. I.E. "Do X of Y" and some of the objectives within the WQ's themselves.

Going to be modifying the uptime of these. They will be more rare and short duration so that they feel more special when they are up and itemization should make them lucrative and appealing. 

Exploring the option of having these available to do on alts who are still leveling up in the Broken Isles. Would be a way to breakup the level up experience and hearken back to that aspect of the pre-launch events that folks enjoyed.

Misc. behind the scenes tweaks and tuning happening as well. 

The real itemization/reward pass hasn't occurred yet waiting for this feedback round to settle out so that will help once it is done.

Thanks again for the feedback and look forward to more after some of the updates above make it out to PTR in the coming weeks. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Patch 7.2 Artifact Trait Unlock Quest
There is no way currently as we have it deactivated at the moment. The goal is to have this out next week.

Just focusing on client/server stability and some backend services migration in these early weeks, alongside Demon Assaults. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Female Blood Elf Face Bug
This honestly just looks like case of no rigging in the faces themselves, you know, the same way a model could be in it's t-pose.
This is pretty close, actually. There was a bug in this build that prevented the Female Blood Elf's face from articulating properly. We'll be fixing it in a future build. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 
Beast Mastery Hunter 2 Piece Bonus
One item we need Blizz to change is to change the 2pc Set piece bonus of EagleTalon Battlegear to include a buff for BM Hunters who uses Dire Frenzy talent instead of Stomp talent.
Agreed. We'll be doing this. I don't have specifics yet, but we'll be adding some sort of effect to the Tier 19 2-piece bonus that benefits Dire Frenzy. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 
Frost Mage and Brain Freeze
This is an issue currently, which is made more prominent this patch because the proc rate of Brain Freeze has gotten rather high probably higher than is ideal. We're hesitant to go straight to "Brain Freeze stacks 2 times." For one, we're just repeating Fingers of Frost at that point which has gone from a proc to a sort of a pooled psuedo-resource. But also, this is how rampant power/complexity/pacing creep happens--always fixing a problem by adding a new mechanic that makes something a lot more powerful.

Worth pointing out that "losing DPS" is a bit of a misnomer. Wasting a certain percentage of Brain Freeze procs especially a very predictable percentage, as was pointed out doesn't prohibit tuning the spec around that. That said, we get that it's a bad feeling to feel like you wasted one.

I can see exploring a solution like imperceptibly delaying the Brain Freeze proc. So that if you cast two Frostbolts and then an instant Flurry, the second Frostbolt's Brain Freeze proc will apply just after the Flurry. This is similar to the sort of invisible timing adjustment that happens around Hot Streak to make sure it works intuitively, which generally works well. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 


 Upcoming Change to Group Finder Queues
Since the launch of Legion, we've been keeping an eye on the challenges facing characters on Spanish realms when trying to enter Ashran. Some players have had trouble accessing the zone—due in most part to long queue times—and we've been monitoring the situation to find the best solution. 

After considering our options, we feel that adding Spanish realms to the English queues for group content is the most appropriate fix. Not only should this get players into Ashran faster, it’ll also help with another minor but unpleasant problem—long queue times when using the Dungeon or Raid Finder tools.

So what does this mean for you? After maintenance on February 1, when a character from a Spanish realm queues for PVE dungeons and raids or PVP battlegrounds, including Ashran content using the Group Finder tool, they might be teamed up with players from both Spanish and English realms. 

We understand that this solution may not appeal to everyone, but after strong consideration, we’re confident it’ll provide the most positive results. 

We’d appreciate your thoughts on the change and welcome your feedback in this thread.


MMO-Champion Forums Moderator Recruitment
Good news everyone! We're recruiting moderators for the forums again! The amount of users and posts keeps increasing and we reached the point where we need some help before the trolls take over and play Whack-a-Mod in the Darkmoon Faire. I know it sounds fun, but I'm going to assume we don't want that. 

Please be sure to read the entire post before applying!
