Spine of Deathwing Heroic 25 Changes<br>

Transmogrification Rules<br>
As mentioned in the original post, mailing an heirloom to your alt will strip any transmogrification effect. There was a bug that sometimes prevented this from happening, but it is now fixed.

<br>
LFR 10 Man Size<br>
Having the LFR group size set at 25 allows for a more forgiving experience should errors be made by individual players &#x2014; after all, we believe Raid Finder groups should be a fun way to experience raid content without feeling too punishing to new or inexperienced raiders.<br>
<br>
In regards to the loot issues you mention, such as people winning the same item twice, we&apos;re working on a solution for this.

<br>
Different Deathwing Endings for Different Difficulty Levels<br>
In terms of storytelling and content accessibility, there isn&apos;t a real difficulty. The way we handled Ragnaros was kind of unique, but he&apos;s not the final boss of this expansion.<br>
<br>
Your idea is quite contrary to our motivation for implementing multiple difficulties. We want as many people as possible to be able to experience the story, while still preserving many of the more prestigious rewards and achievements for those who complete Heroic difficulty.

<br>
Why do we have to pay real money for pets/mounts?<br>
Pets and mounts are entirely cosmetic, they don&apos;t give you any in-game benefit or edge over others, therefore they&apos;re not needed, and the statement that they&apos;re &quot;much better&quot; than the ones in the game is completely subjective.<br>
<br>
There are some rare pets and mounts in the game that are only obtainable from certain quests or encounters. If you prefer collecting things through the game, you could focus on getting all of those.
