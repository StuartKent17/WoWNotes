Patch 3.3.3 introduced a lot of data for the prologue, or at least a part of it. If you checked the site when the patch was first release you already know that players will be able to recapture Gnomeregan (Alliance) and the Echo Isles (Horde). <br>
<br>
Achievements and Overcloaks<br>
This is where it all started, the new achievements were discovered instantly on the Item Database Latest Additions (http://db.mmo-champion.com/latest).<br>
<br>
Gnomecoming King (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4786/) - You assisted High Tinker Mekkatorque and the Gnomeregan Exiles in the recapture of Gnomeregan&apos;s surface.<br>
Gnomecoming Queen (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4787/) - You assisted High Tinker Mekkatorque and the Gnomeregan Exiles in the recapture of Gnomeregan&apos;s surface.<br>
<br>
There isn&apos;t any Horde achievement for the moment and they will probably be added to the game in a later PTR build.<br>
<br>
After digging a little more in the game files it also looks like players will be rewarded with &quot;cosmetic cloaks&quot; at some point. Apparently, Blizzard introduced an Overcloak mechanism that allows you to change the appearance of your cloak without having to unequip your regular super-epic cloak.<br>
<br>
Gnomeregan Overcloak (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74842/gnomeregan-overcloak/) - Right Click to don a cosmetic cloak. Will cover the appearance but not the effect of any existing cloak.<br>
Orgrimmar Overcloak (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74847/orgrimmar-overcloak/) - Right Click to don a cosmetic cloak. Will cover the appearance but not the effect of any existing cloak.<br>
<br>
More spells should be introduced later according to the models I found in the game files. (Personal message to Blizzard: Guild Tabards overcloaks, please!)<br>

<br>
<br>
Flight Paths<br>
More flight paths have been added to the game. First, you have to understand that everytime you use a vehicle following an automated path, most of the coordinates it uses are stored in your client and aren&apos;t received from the server. Knowing that, we can reproduce the paths on a world map (yes, we can do that) and check where the various Cataclysm missions will bring us. <br>

Quest Lines<br>
A lot of quests have been added to the game for this event. Keep in mind that this is only a small part of the entire event but it will give you a good idea of how players will recapture Gnomeregan and the Echo Isles.<br>

Our engineers have been working on getting our battle machines ready for our assault on Gnomeregan, but we&apos;re out of pilots! We&apos;ve developed a device called the Motivate-a-Tron, which prevents distraction from other sources and gives the gnome the courage to enlist. After motivating a few Gnome Citizens, lead them out to Captain Tread Sparknozzle out at Steelgrill&apos;s Depot, just south of Ironforge. Oh, and be careful.

Description<br>
Harbingers of doom are nothing new on the streets of Orgrimmar, but I&apos;m worried about this latest batch. These people are organized and they&apos;ve attracted a lot of attention in the Drag, where they seem to congregate. I&apos;ve thought about rounding them up or otherwise disrupting their activities, but that will just drive them underground. We need to find out more about them. Would you go to the Drag, listen to what these doomsayers are spreading, and gather any literature you can find about their ideas? <br>
<br>
Quest - Signs of the Times (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25254/signs-of-the-times/) / Signs of the Times (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25282/signs-of-the-times/)<br>

I&apos;ve had my men place markers around heavily traveled areas in Orgrimmar. Take these posters and set them up where you see the markers. They won&apos;t discourage the most determined of seekers, but it&apos;s a first step in exposing this cult.

Approach one of the Doomsayers in the Drag and tell them you wish to join their group. With any luck, they will give you instructions to introduce yourself to one of the group&apos;s leaders and tell you where the group is hiding. Don any clothing given to you by the doomsayer; you&apos;ll need it to gain entry to the group&apos;s hideout. <br>
<br>
Quest - Spreading the Word (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25380/spreading-the-word/) / Spreading the Word (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25415/spreading-the-word/)<br>

Description<br>
Welcome to the farm, &lt;name&gt;. Everyone here works to earn &lt;his/her&gt; keep. For some, that means caring for the animals. Others are responsible for working on our construction projects. Still others work to spread our message among the people and I think that&apos;s a good place for you to start. Take this board. It bears a short message about our beliefs. While wearing the board, visit the eastern and western zeppelin towers outside Orgrimmar&apos;s gates, as well as the town square of Razor Hill, to the south. <br>

Description<br>
You&apos;re fitting in well here, &lt;name&gt;, but there is more to us than daily chores and spreading the message. I&apos;m sure you heard a little bit about it when you first joined. As you know, this world is ending and the unprepared will die painful deaths. We have been given a gift, an opportunity to become something greater and more powerful. Overseer Golbaz is will be preparing a ritual before the altar at the eastern end of the farm. Wait there for him, and learn more of your new brothers and sisters. <br>
<br>
Quest - The Doomsday Plan (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25417/the-doomsday-plan/) / The Doomsday Plan (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25347/the-doomsday-plan/)<br>
Objective - Take the Elemental Devices to Blood Guard Torek in Orgrimmar&apos;s Valley of Strength.<br>
Description<br>
The first batch of elemental devices are ready. Your task will be to conceal them inside the city of Orgrimmar. The devices will unleash their fire elementals at the proper time. Don&apos;t worry, &lt;name&gt;, you&apos;ll be safely away before that happens. Do not do anything that would draw attention to yourself. &lt;The overseer hands you a package containing several of the elemental devices. This is just the kind of proof that Blood Guard Torek was hoping you&apos;d uncover. You should probably bring the devices to him.&gt; <br>
<br>

We have to find and disable the rest of the devices before set their captive elementals free and burn down the city. Are you familiar enough with the devices to destroy them? You need to break them open before the fire elementals inside have had time to reach full strength. They should be easy to defeat if you open the devices early. The cultists have probably put them all over the city. <br>
<br>
Quest - Warn King Wrynn (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25425/warn-king-wrynn/) / Warn the Warchief (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25351/alert-the-warchief/)<br>

Description<br>
You have successfully defended Orgrimmar from the threat posed by this Twilight&apos;s Hammer cult, &lt;name&gt;, and without shedding the blood of our own people. Our enemy will not rest for long. I cannot imagine that Cho&apos;Gall will accept defeat so easily. You must take word to Thrall. Go to the Valley of Wisdom and speak to him in Grommash Hold. Tell the warchief that our enemies have shown themselves and we must be prepared for their return. <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque: The Liberation of Gnomeregan<br>
Gelbin Mekkatorque is known as much for his technical brilliance as he is for his just leadership of the gnomes. In addition to being elected high tinker, the most prominent rank in gnomish society, Gelbin proved himself to be an inventor without equal by leading the construction of the Deeprun Tram, which links Stormwind and Ironforge. Yet all of the high tinker&apos;s achievements have been overshadowed by one catastrophic event that occurred under his rule: the fall of Gnomeregan.<br>
<br>
Around the time of the Third War, an ancient menace known as the troggs surfaced in Gnomeregan from the depths of Azeroth. This barbaric race, thought to have been unintentionally released during the Uldaman excavation, crushed the gnomes&apos; defenses and became entrenched in the lower sections of the city. Gelbin, for all his genius, was at a loss for a way to eradicate the savage invaders until his chief advisor, Mekgineer Sicco Thermaplugg, proposed that they inundate Gnomeregan with toxic radiation.<br>
<br>
Confident in Thermaplugg&apos;s radical plan, Mekkatorque gave the order to irradiate the city. This bold move worked at first: toxic radiation spread throughout Gnomeregan and momentarily stopped the troggs&apos; incursion. Soon, however, it was evident that the radiation was killing gnomes as well as troggs. In the end, nearly eighty percent of the gnomish race died, and many of those who survived were mutated into deranged leper gnomes. To add to the tragedy, the troggs then resumed their assault on the city.<br>
<br>
Mekkatorque and the healthy survivors evacuated Gnomeregan and were taken in by the dwarves of neighboring Ironforge, but Thermaplugg disappeared. The high tinker later learned troubling news that his former advisor had seized control of the toxic gnomish city and instated himself as its twisted overlord. Much to Mekkatorque&apos;s shock, he also discovered that Thermaplugg had secretly desired the office of high tinker and might have been previously aware of or even complicit in the trogg invasion.<br>
<br>
The immense loss of life at Gnomeregan weighed heavy on Mekkatorque&apos;s shoulders, and in his fury he ordered the death of Thermaplugg. A band of heroes took up the mission and returned with a tale of victory, but after analyzing the claim, Mekkatorque realized that the mechanized overlord defeated in the depths of the city was likely nothing more than a cleverly engineered facsimile of Thermaplugg.<br>
<br>
Aware that defeating his nemesis would require a more robust approach, Mekkatorque labored over strategies to retake his city. His tireless brainstorming recently paid off with Operation: Gnomeregan, a brilliant multi-phased assault plan to liberate the gnomish capital and bring the real Thermaplugg to justice. With the operation set to begin, resourceful gnomes such as &quot;Doc&quot; Cogspin, Captain Tread Sparknozzle, and Drill Sergeant Steamcrank have been overseeing preparations and fine-tuning new technology that will be vital to the offensive.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Mekkatorque has begun rounding up all able-bodied gnomes to join in the attack, and his call to arms has also been heard by other members of the Alliance. The gnomes&apos; techno-savvy has been vital in past conflicts, and many Alliance heroes are likely to join the offensive to recapture the extraordinary inventions within the fallen city. For Mekkatorque, however, his plan goes beyond just reacquiring lost technology. The retaking of Gnomeregan will determine his legacy in history, either as the high tinker who lost the gnomes&apos; beloved capital, or the one who reestablished it as the center of innovation on Azeroth.<br>
<br>
Operation: Gnomeregan is now. <br>

Vol&apos;jin: The Glory of the Darkspears<br>
Most of Azeroth&apos;s savage trolls are infamous for their extreme hatred of other races, but the Darkspear tribe and its leader, Vol&apos;jin, are an exception. Over the years, the Darkspears have proven to be invaluable members of the Horde. Vol&apos;jin in particular is known to offer strategic advice to Warchief Thrall on a regular basis, and the cunning troll played a role in retaking the Undercity after it was overthrown by the rebel forces of Varimathras and Putress.<br>
<br>
Yet for all of the tribe&apos;s accomplishments, the Darkspears are still plagued by a tragic history of exile. Long ago they were driven from Stranglethorn Vale&apos;s mainland by the more powerful trolls of the Gurubashi empire and then settled on a remote island. The Darkspears later sought refuge with the Horde when their isle was destroyed by a mysterious sea witch, and Thrall granted the trolls new lands on the Echo Isles off the coast of Durotar. Aside from a brief exodus when Daelin Proudmoore&apos;s fleet arrived to hunt down orcs, the Darkspears enjoyed relative stability until one of their own, Zalazane, drove his brethren from their latest home.<br>
<br>
The witch doctor Zalazane had been one of the tribe&apos;s leading mystical instructors when he was inexplicably driven to insanity by the powers under his control. Utilizing dark magic, he enslaved many of his fellow tribespeople and amassed an army of mindless Darkspear trolls. Fearing that all of his tribe would come under Zalazane&apos;s sway, Vol&apos;jin ordered the remaining free Darkspears to abandon the Echo Isles.<br>
<br>
Vol&apos;jin&apos;s Darkspears settled in nearby Sen&apos;jin Village, which they have since used as a staging point to attack Zalazane. Over the years, members of the Horde looking to test their worth have braved the Echo Isles to confront Zalazane, and many of them even returned victorious with his severed head. These victories, however, proved to be nothing more than an illusion created by the twisted witch doctor&apos;s dark magic. Days after these trophies were taken to Sen&apos;jin Village, they reverted to their true forms: painted rocks and coconuts adorned with wooden tusks, or even the heads of Zalazane&apos;s enslaved trolls.<br>
<br>
Despite these setbacks and his preoccupation with advising Thrall on Horde-related matters, Vol&apos;jin has spent considerable time formulating a strategy to recapture the Echo Isles. Now he believes that the time to strike at Zalazane has come. As the Darkspear leader and his close allies Vanira and Champion Uru&apos;zin await approval of their plan from the ancestral spirits, they have begun rounding up new troll recruits and staging reconnaissance missions to learn about Zalazane&apos;s minions.<br>
<br>
Yet Vol&apos;jin&apos;s trolls are short on forces, and the enslaved Darkspears on the Echo Isles outnumber them. The Darkspears are well-known for being among Azeroth&apos;s bravest combatants, however, and fortunately many non-trolls have expressed interest in assisting Vol&apos;jin, perhaps hoping that restoring the Echo Isles will eventually bolster the Horde&apos;s strength.<br>
<br>
Vol&apos;jin is also aware of the strategic importance that a Darkspear homeland offers his allies, but he is motivated by more personal reasons. Zalazane&apos;s betrayal was an affront against Vol&apos;jin&apos;s dream of a better life for his tribe, a destiny that his late father, Sen&apos;jin, envisioned years ago. Only by retaking the Echo Isles will Vol&apos;jin be able to honor his father and at long last secure a permanent homeland for the long-exiled Darkspear tribe. <br>
