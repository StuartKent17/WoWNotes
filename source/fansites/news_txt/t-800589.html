We&apos;re pleased to announce that the two recently revealed in-game pets, Lil&apos; Ragnaros and the Moonkin Hatchling, are now available in the Pet Store section of the online Blizzard Store at a price of $10 each.<br>
<br>
Lil&apos; Ragnaros, the Tiniest Firelord<br>
<br>
Ragnaros, the dread master of all fire elementals, will return in Cataclysm to avenge his defeat in Molten Core. And what better way to head into battle than with a miniature version of the firelord himself following at your beck and call? Lil&apos; Ragnaros, just like his full-scale namesake, burns with constant fury (not to mention flames that serve as a handy cooking fire) and comes equipped with the legendary hammer Sulfuras. And as a being of pure elemental fire, he has no need to walk from place to place -- he just submerges into the magma below the world&apos;s surface when you start walking and reemerges when you stop.<br>
<br>
Moonkin Hatchling Charity Pet -- For the Children!<br>
<br>
The googly-eyed Moonkin Hatchling, which comes in unique Horde and Alliance versions, will occasionally plant flowers at your feet, and happily /dances with any willing partners. Like last year&apos;s Pandaren Monk, the Moonkin Hatchling has a soft spot for helping children. For every Moonkin Hatchling adopted from November 29 through December 31, 2010, Blizzard Entertainment will donate 50% of the $10 purchase price to the Make-A-Wish Foundation&#xAE;.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks to the support of all the World of Warcraft players out there who purchased the Pandaren Monk last year, we were able to donate more than $1.1 million to Make-A-Wish this past February. We&#x2019;re looking forward to making another big contribution to this great cause on behalf of the World of Warcraft community following the close of this year&#x2019;s promotion.<br>
