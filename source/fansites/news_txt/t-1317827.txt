Patch 5.4 - Legendary Cloak Effects
Along with the new procs on the legendary cloak come some nice new spell effects. Keep in mind the size and positioning of the effects in the preview are aren't from an official preview, so don't expect the final effect to appear in the same place or be the same size as our preview.

Blue Tweets
PvE
Only ToT raids are not x-realm in guild modes - not sure why it is still snowflake delayed after another patch.
We want guilds and realms to still have meaning. Source 

in the world of bring the player not the class shouldn't Drums  be equivalent to lust and not weaker?
If the goal was that you had all buffs regardless of comp then we'd just give them all passively. Source 
The goal was to give players flexibility to e.g. bring a high DPS player over a low DPS player with a mandatory buff. Source 
Comp is much more flexible now, but not infinitely so. Source 
We think you can fit a mage, shaman or hunter in your 10 or live with weaker lust. Source 
Isn't this raid buff thing mostly there to shit on 10m raids? 25s get them all by accident.
Buffs are there to make you feel stronger in a group and to encourage some level of raid diversity. Source 
We know there are 10s that would love to bring e.g. 7 druids, but even they are still viable, just at a disadvantage. Source 

Should I take this as "Bring the Player Not the Class" is now less of a goal for Blizzard than it was during wrath?
I would phrase it as we largely fixed the Sunwell problem. Source 
We were coming off of Sunwell where raid comps were absurdly rigid. Source 
Most guilds not competing for world first have huge latitude in their group comp. Source 

"Finders" have soiled social exps. and has been repeatedly proven. I really like that hs requires forming groups.
I think the key is there have to be alternatives. Social / challenging and finder / easier seems like a good formula. Source 

How about this for once: "Tough." Nerfing content is not serving the game or the company. Refute me, please.
This sounds like the myth that hard content forces players to rise to the challenge and not quit. Source 
If it's a myth, then why is it bad for HScens to be nerfed? Maybe having goals is important for progression?
The difference is there are alternatives to heroic scenarios. The problem with e.g. Cat dungeons was there were not. Source 

Divide in this aspect. Do you think there are players who would like long lasting interractions but miss opportunities in game
Overall we think players tend to stick with the game longer if they have a social network. But that is not something we can force. Source 
Forcing players to find groups by making content hard and providing no matchmaking isn't a good recipe for success. Source 
When you provide the ability to play alone, many players will, and then, where's the necessary social network?
From its launch, WoW was vastly more solo friendly than the typical MMO. This isn't a new thing. Source 
But if we can lure players into social experiences, hopefully they will have more fun. Source 
But removing solo isn't the answer. This is a case that IS bait and switch. You need the solo bait. Source 

Again, what's the purpose of a kick ability if we're not supposed to use it?
We can't distinguish between a kick because someone is abusive or AFK legit and someone who hasn't seen the fights before. Source 
We see tanks who say "this is my first time" get kicked. Surely you can agree that's not a good use of the kick feature. Source 

Raid Finder and Flex Raiding
They weren't Raiders before, this confirms NM raiding is dead. 40% loss of NM teams in 1 TIER, source SG vs Jin kills
We didn't provide instant catch up mechanics this time, so many guilds still lack the ilevel to do ToT successfully. Source 
Instant catch up has very serious pros and cons, neither easily dismissed. Source 

Interesting that you acknowledge this yet deny that the ruthless tuning of encounters has damaged the NM scene.
It's what I said a few days ago about 10s now being tuned like 25s. Flex should help with players looking for that ICC 10 feel. Source 
And it's not fair to the 25s if 10s are easier logistically and easier in difficulty so long as they provide the same loot. Source 

Are you not worried that raiding is getting complicated? Raid loot especially. LFR,Flex,Norm,NormTF,Heroic, Heroic TF etc :|
We have a huge diversity of players so having many options makes sense as long as folks can figure out which content is for them. Source 

Do you honestly think LFR/LFG is a good thing? Does it have a chance at going away at all?
Yes and no, respectively. We do hope with flex we can tempt some players into what we think will be more fun for them. Source 

Why not make LFR only for raids older than current content. Fixes all problems. Don't run out of content, older raids used.
Players get excited seeing e.g. the awesome Throne of Thunder trailer, only to hear that the new raid isn't for them. Source 
It's like when a new movie sequel comes out, you really ought to see the first one, but it would be a bad idea to mandate that. Source 
well then tell them to get a group. it's an MMORPG not a single player game.
I have said this several times lately, but another expansion of spamming LFG for a dungeon pug and I myself might have quit. Source 
And I have almost always been in a huge guild with lots of friends. It does not guarantee you a group whenever you want it. Source 

"Fun to do"? I'm sorry but everyone i know playing the game hates LFR, only doing it for a few minor upgrades...
We know there are plenty of players who enjoy LFR. Several of them tweet that to me. Let them have their fun. Source 
If it's a few minor upgrades, then they aren't really the LFR audience. Source 
Speaking of, why no thunderforged in LFR?
Tforged is primarily to provide raiding with a long tail. LFR isn't really trying to deliver on that same experience. Source 
I love LFR. LFR QQ only comes from elitiests who think that there are a lot more of them than there actually is!
I would not have phrased it so harshly, but I do agree many raiders don't understand how hardcore their perceptions really are. Source 

Please tell me now if you are planning to remove or severely gut LFR in 6.0 so I can go ahead and walk away for good.
We haven't talked about future expansion plans much yet, but I don't imagine LFR will change fundamentally. Source 
We'd like to entice more players into Flex B/C we think they will have more fun but want to do that with carrots, not sticks. Source 

For LFR/coins, big loot table feels like a penalty. Harder to get item you want. What if 7.5% per item, instead of flat 15%?
Big loot tables are a challenge. But, we like lots of options instead of one slot per customer. Bigger raids helps some. Source 

Patch 5.4 PvE
5.4 Ahead of the Curve FoS split into 10 and 25 or datamining shenanigans?; are we looking at separate server 1st achieves?
Overall we just want to make it easier for players to be able to identify in which raid someone earned an achievement. Source 

Please stop wasting resources on side games and distractions. PvP brawler's pet battles. How many 5 mans with those hours?
None actually from those two examples. Different teams. Source 
Honestly dailies are the quickest way to get lesser charms, I know there are other ways, but rng on those, dailies are boring
I'm not sure that's true. Last week I got my charms by making a group and farming Barrens bosses. Source 
GC seems to be missing the point, what is the difference between farming barrens and dailies? Same thing.
If you never want to leave instances, just understand you're going to have a lot less content than other players. Source 
Just explain why, to be most efficient in instances, I _have_ to do unrelated content like dailies or farming the Barrens?
We want to reward players for participating in a wide variety of content rather than risking burn out by tunneling on one thing. Source 
By making the additional content a bonus we give players the option to opt out if they only want to do the bare minimum. Source 

Looks like we're fighting UNDER Org in the "never before seen cavern of dark hallways"... instead of in the streets, sigh 
In the streets too, but if we had left it at that, we would have heard "Rehashed raid zone." Source 

will SoO have a linear or a non linear progression path ?
Less linear than ToT. Source 
To be clear, it's not super non-linear. We want to make future raids more like BWD or UIduar in terms of linearity. Source 

PvP
Nobody is taking real tanks anymore in pvp post 5.3. I want to tank in pvp but im not allowed to. Could we get a nerf 2 debuff
The problem is that when tanks are having fun in PvP, I'm not sure anyone else is. Source 

Ever given thought to the GW2 style of PVP gearing? Would remove all the bickering over pve vs pvp gear and focus on skill
It is one of those heated arguments where both sides seem eager to dismiss the other view point as wrong. Source 
Gear should matter since I worked hard and want goals vs only skill should matter. Source 
As a counterpoint, look at how many PvP players didn't like the 5.3 change that lessened the impact of their hard-earned gear. Source 

removing every fun factor out of hunters for pve because you can't balance pvp. hypocritical when you revert warlocks nerf
That sounds like we're not allowed to make any class changes because it would be hypocritical. Source 

how do you want pvpers to make money? I see my 150g repair bill after a day of bgs and can't afford it.
How do PvE'rs make money? Unless their guild is very generous, it's not from running instances.... Source 

The more offensive cds you add to the game, the less skill required the game becomes. It just promotes Swifty macros
It depends if they can all be lined up or not. We're really souring on the gameplay of lining everything up all the time. Source 
Lining up CDs represents strategic play. Mutually exclusive or randomised CDs converts it to FCFS tactics =
The synergistic effects of all those CDs at once overrides using them intelligently over time. That removes strategy IMOO. Source 


Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud 
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud  will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices  are stable or slightly increasing, with most SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. RAM prices are continuing to go up, so if you were thinking about adding RAM anytime soon, now is the time.

The new Haswell CPUs from Intel are here  and they run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14  or H90  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions! If you are interested in Folding@home, take a look in our team's thread
