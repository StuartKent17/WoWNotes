Glyphs Hotfix
Due to an error, there were a few glyphs that were unable to be crafted via Inscription, which made them unobtainable. These glyphs are:

Glyph of the Solstice  Druid
Glyph of Purification  Priest
Glyph of Purify Spirit  Shaman
Glyph of Flying Fists  Monk

To make sure players have access to them, we've added them to the Inscription vendors in Stormshield and Warspear. Alliance players can purchase them from Joao Calhandro , and Horde players can purchase them from Maru'sa 

Update: We're also working on adding Glyph of Cleanse  Paladin and Glyph of Frostbrand Weapon  Shaman. Glyph of Cleanse will be added to the Inscription vendors like the other glyphs. Glyph of Frostbrand Weapon's item is missing from the game files, so we can't add it to the vendors via hotfix. Instead, it will be automatically taught to all Shaman level 75 or higher.

Except they aren't there? When will this be live?
It's live already. They'll only be visible to the classes that are able to use them.

How will I make a ton of bank off people who haven't seen this then? 
I should also probably mention that they're Unique and Bind on Pickup, for exactly that reason 

Regarding Glyph of Blackout Kick  It will return, but as the glyph is completely missing from game data, it can't be added via hotfix. It'll have to wait for a content patch. Sorry

Ink traders should be working now!


Enveloping Mist Hotfix
We've just pushed live a hotfix that increases the healing done by Enveloping Mist  by 50%. This most likely won't be added to the hotfix blog until after the weekend, but we wanted to be sure you were aware of it before then, as it's already active.

Trinkets with primary stats in the proc/use part are always better than any other trinket type for DPS.
Theorycraft and supporting evidence would help. A recent hotfix should have solved this. Celestalon 
Ah I see the change now. 220 -> 147 static stat, no change to the procs? Been afk since that I guess.
Yes, the hotfix fixed the stats by changing passive amounts on many Draenor trinkets. Celestalon 

will the wargames gear ever be made available for transmog? or is the conquest gear that isn't currently available the same look?
It will intentionally not be available for transmog. holinka 

Garrisons
can the retraining certificate cause a follower to LOSE bodyguard? I would love to retrain on of my bodyguards, but I'm afraid to.
Bodyguard trait isn't re-rollable Muffinus 

PvP
How come you can't join a friends server in Ashran? This would help with the imbalanced servers, if you could just fix it yourself
it could also and most likely would make it worse. We might enable it when we're happier with faction balance. holinka
