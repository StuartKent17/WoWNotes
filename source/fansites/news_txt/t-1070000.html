I just received an update on the Patch 4.3.2, it seems that the update was postponed because of a very bad bug. As far as I know it means the patch won&apos;t happen tomorrow, however it might happen on wednesday in the US and thursday in Europe. If it&apos;s not the case it will be postponed to next week. <br>
<br>
The info was solid and was backed up by a few other things (announcement of PTRs going down, etc) but those last minute changes happen, and there&apos;s nothing I can do against them. This is also the reason why Blizzard doesn&apos;t announce patches early. <br>
<br>
Even if I always warn that things might be postponed, it still sucks when it does happen, and this is pretty much how comfortable I feel when I have to announce it (http://i.imgur.com/WEKwE.gif). Feel free to yell at me and make me sad. I&apos;ll be in my corner trying to hide in my happy place (http://i.imgur.com/zjL8T.gif).</div></div>
