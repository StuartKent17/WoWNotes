An interesting change was made to hippogryphs mounts in patch 3.3 .... they finally have ground animations! They will now walk and run just like any other mount. <br>

Quests Datamining - Quel&apos;Delar<br>
There is a lot of speculation going on a few sites based on the Quel&apos;Delar quest chain datamined a few days ago and available on the Database (http://db.mmo-champion.com/). I figured I should add a few information here. <br>
<br>
First, do not expect a new player legendary item, this is most likely a storyline quest chain to ultimately give back the powerful sword to one of your faction leaders. The chain is as follow :<br>
<br>
The Battered Hilt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14443/the-battered-hilt/) - Bring the Battered Hilt to Caladis Brightspear at Quel&apos;Delar&apos;s rest.<br>
What The Dragons Know (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14444/what-the-dragons-know/) - Speak to Krasus at the top of Wyrmrest Temple, then report your findings to Arcanist Tybalin in the Silver Enclave in Dalaran.<br>
The Sunreaver Plan (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14457/the-sunreaver-plan/) - Bring the Sunreaver Orders to Arcanist Tybalin at the Silver Enclave in Dalaran.<br>
A Suitable Disguise (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/20438/a-suitable-disguise/) - Obtain a Borrowed Tabard from Shandy Sparkleshine and bring it to Arcanist Tybalin at the Silver Enclave in Dalaran.<br>
A Meeting With The Magister (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/20439/a-meeting-with-the-magister/) - Retrieve the Ancient Dragonforged Blades tome for Arcanist Tybalin in Dalaran&apos;s Silver Enclave.<br>
Return to Caladis Brightspear (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24454/return-to-caladis-brightspear/) - Bring Ancient Dragonforged Blades to Caladis Brightspear at Quel&apos;Delar&apos;s Rest.<br>
Re-Forging The Sword (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24461/re-forging-the-sword/) (Provided: Remnants of Quel&apos;Delar (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49740/remnants-of-quel-delar/)) - Caladis Brightspear at Quel&apos;Delar&apos;s Rest wants you to obtain 5 Infused Saronite Bars and use the Forgemaster&apos;s Hammer to combine them with the Battered Hilt to create the Re-forged Quel&apos;Delar.<br>
Tempering the Blade (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24476/tempering-the-blade/) (Provided: Reforged Quel&apos;Delar (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49739/re-forged-quel-delar/)) - <br>
The Halls of Reflection (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24480/the-halls-of-reflection/) - Bring your Tempered Quel&apos;Delar to Sword&apos;s Rest inside the Halls of Reflection. Return to Caladis Brightspear at Quel&apos;Delar&apos;s rest after you have completed your journey.<br>
Journey to the Sunwell (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24522/journey-to-the-sunwell/) - Speak with Halduron Brightwing at the entrance to the Sunwell Plateau on the Isle of Quel&apos;Danas.<br>
Thalorien Dawnseeker (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24535/thalorien-dawnseeker/) - Visit Thalorienn Dawnseeker&apos;s Remains and obtain his blessing to wield Quel&apos;Delar, then return to Halduron Brightwing near the entrance to the Sunwell.<br>
There is also The Purification of Quel&apos;Delar (Vereesa) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24553/the-purification-of-quel-delar/) / The Purification of Quel&apos;Delar (Aethas) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24594/the-purification-of-quel-delar/) / The Purification of Quel&apos;Delar (Mariel) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24595/the-purification-of-quel-delar/) but for some reasons this quest isn&apos;t included in the chain started by The Battered Hilt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14443/the-battered-hilt/).<br>
<br>
The Argent Crusade version of the description of The Purification of Quel&apos;Delar (Mariel) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24595/the-purification-of-quel-delar/) suggests that you will ultimately give the weapon to a NPC. &quot;It may be best to entrust the weapon to the Argent Crusade, where it will serve as a symbol to unite the Lich King&apos;s enemies.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now if you want some real speculation from quests datamining, I suggest that you keep these links bookmarked and check them after each PTR build to see if they are updated :<br>
<br>
The Splintered Throne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24548/the-splintered-throne/) - Probably related to the Frozen Throne ... and Arthas?<br>
Shadowmourne, Blade of Legends (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24549/shadowmourne-blade-of-legends/) - Legendary weapon.<br>
Icecrown Citadel Quests on the DB (http://db.mmo-champion.com/quests/?zone=4812)<br>
<br>
One of the quest in the Icecrown Citadel is already available - The Sacred and the Corrupt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24545/the-sacred-and-the-corrupt/)<br>
<br>
Objective<br>
Place Light&apos;s Vengeance and Runeforged Saronite in Highlord Mograine&apos;s runeforge in Icecrown Citadel.<br>
<br>
Description<br>
It is against my judgment that I present you this errand, &lt;race&gt;, as it will likely end in your undoing.<br>
<br>
Ignore my counsel and embark on this endeavor, and I shall provide you with the necessary knowledge and resources to see it through. Its success shall depend on your fortitude being greater than that endowed to most mortals.<br>
<br>
Recover Light&apos;s Vengeance, Arthas&apos; discarded hammer. Combined with saronite, it will provide the foundation for our work. <br>

Pet resilience<br>
We certainly don&apos;t think pet resilience is useless. We are considering increasing it to 100% of master&apos;s resilience to make up for the increased AE damage pets will take in PvP. We don&apos;t want pets to explode on contact (neither do we want pet classes to be twice as difficult to kill) but we did think it was a little goofy and unintuitive that pets could just shrug off AE attacks in PvP. We&apos;d rather make pets tougher against all types of damage than be vulnerable to some and nearly immune to others.

Infernal and Doomguard<br>
The Infernal and Doomguard have the 90% creature avoidance that other pets do in patch 3.3. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20122738547-please-fix-infernal-and-doomguard.html))<br>
