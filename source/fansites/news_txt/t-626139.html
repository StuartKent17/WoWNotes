The layout of the original post has been slightly changed to make it more readable<br>
We have talked about making some of these changes and wanted to provide more details. You should be able to try these out yourselves on the PTR before they go live.<br>
<br>
Our reason for most of these changes should be obvious, but some common themes are:<br>
Making tanking still rely on cooldowns, but rely on them a little less.<br>
Make Blood a more attractive spec, and particularly for tanking.<br>
Chill out some of the defensive capabilities all DKs have in PvP.<br>
Avoid having to use Death and Decay as an out-of-combat runic power generator.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
General<br>
All multi-rune abilities generate 15 runic power.<br>
New runeforge rune -- Rune of the Stoneskin Gargoyle (two-handed only) now grants 25 Defense and 2% Stamina.<br>
Many death knight glyphs have been changed. In many cases the negative consequences were removed.<br>
New death knight sigils are now available, primarily from vendors, including a tanking-oriented sigil. <br>
<br>
Blood<br>
Rune Strike (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=56815) -- damage decreased from 200% to 150% but threat increased to 150% from 100%.<br>
The healing of Blood Aura (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=50371), Blood Presence (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48266) and Death Pact (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48743) has been doubled.<br>
Heart Strike (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55262) &#x2013; we overhauled this ability. It no longer has a haste debuff but will now be able to strike two targets like a cleave. It still hits for more than Blood Strike, but you can still use Blood Strike if e.g. you don&#x2019;t want to break CC.<br>
Bloody Strikes (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49395) &#x2013; the bonus damage from Pestilence has been moved here to help Blood AE slightly.<br>
Vampiric Blood (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55233) -- in addition to its current effects, also adds 20% health temporarily.<br>
Will of the Necropolis (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=50150) -- now reduces the damage of any attack that takes the DK below 35% health by 5 /10/15% instead of boosting armor when wounded,<br>
Dancing Rune Weapon (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49028) &#x2013; cost reduced from 60 to 40 runic power.<br>
<br>
Frost<br>
Icebound Fortitude (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48792) &#x2013; now reduces damage by 20% instead of 50%. The amount of damage reduced increases with bonus Defense (to about 35% for 540 Defense, but it can go higher). The stun immunity is intended to be its primary role in PvP.<br>
Frost Presence (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48263) -- bonus armor increased from 60 to 80% and magic damage reduction increased from 5 to 15%. We wanted to reduce the effectiveness of cooldowns but bring up base mitigation to reduce damage spikiness.<br>
Horn of Winter (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=57623) -- now has no cost and grants 10 runic power in addition to its stat buff, but has a 30 sec cooldown.<br>
Hungering Cold (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49203) &#x2013; cost reduced from 60 to 40 runic power.<br>
<br>
Unholy<br>
Anti-Magic Shell (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48707) -- cooldown lowered to 45 sec from 60 sec.<br>
Bone Shield (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49222) -- mitigation reduced from 40% to 20%.<br>
Corpse Explosion (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=51328) -- damage increased substantially, added 5 sec cooldown, and changed cost to 40 runic power.<br>
Night of the Dead (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55623) -- now grants 40/70% passive area spell avoidance to your pet in addition to its current effects.<br>
Outbreak (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55237) &#x2013; this talent no longer receive bonus damage from Pestilence. The bonus from Plague Strike and Blood Boil has been increased slightly.<br>
Pestilence (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=51429) -- no longer has a 10 sec cooldown.<br>
Raise Dead (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=46584) -- now split into two spells: Raise Dead now raises a ghoul or pet ghoul (if talented). Raise Ally now raises a fallen party member (at no reagent cost).<br>
Shadow of Death (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49157) -- duration reduced from 45 seconds to 25 seconds.<br>
Unholy Blight (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=51379) &#x2013; cost reduced from 60 to 40 runic power.<br>
