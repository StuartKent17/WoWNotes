Battle.Net Launcher Update - Warcraft III
A recent update to the Battle.Net launcher added a background and icons for Warcraft III, just like the ones that currently exist for other games. No support for the game was added yet, but keep in mind that at Blizzcon 2013  it was mentioned that people were working on a side project to update the old Warcraft games to run on modern versions of Windows.

If you already have the game, don't forget to attach  your CD key to your Battle.Net account.


  
 


Warlords of Draenor - Upcoming Beta Build
Another beta build is on the way! Check back later for notes.
The Beta realms will be shutting down for maintenance in a few minutes in order to deploy a new build. I'll be updating this thread with information and time estimates as I receive them. I don't have an ETA yet, but these pushes usually take at least 8 hours, if not more.

No character wipe is planned today.


Warlords of Draenor - Bonus Rolls
Today we are taking a look at some of the ways to earn bonus rolls in Warlords of Draenor. 

With Patch 6.0.2 only a couple weeks away, don't forget to start collecting some Lesser Charms  for item upgrades or uncapped turn ins for Siege of Orgrimmar bonus rolls Warforged Seal if you still need them. You can find other Patch 6.0 reminders in our previous post 

We looked at the first way recently  with the Bunker / War Mill  perk that grants you a free bonus roll every week, but there are a few other ways to earn rolls. 

The second method of earning bonus rolls is the two rare garrison missions that reward them. Keep in mind these are Rare missions, so you won't see them constantly. Rukhmar  and Drov the Ruiner  both reward one Seal of Tempered Fate 

The third method to earn bonus rolls are turn in quests. The second and third time you use a certain method in a week it will cost double of what it did the last time.


Apexis Crystal  1000  / 2000  / 4000 - Players can earn at 1000 per day through a type of daily quest in your garrison, another 1000 from an Ashran daily quest , along with some from work orders and other sources. These are also used to purchase armor that is upgradeable to item level 655 ;_!, which is the same as Normal level raid loot.<br><br>
Gold 500  / 1000  / 2000  - Keep in mind that gold is somewhat easier to earn in Warlords of Draenor, as it is taking the role of Valor <br><br>
Garrison Resources  300  / 600  / 1200  - There are many sources of Garrison Resources. Your garrison gives you some every day, missions beta.wowdb.com/currencies/824-garrison-resources#related:rewarded-from-mission;_! can reward some, the Lumber Mill  can provide some, and there are many other sources. After your buildings are built and upgraded, you may have spare Garrison Resources that can be used for these quests or converted into Trade Goods beta.wowdb.com/currencies/824-garrison-resources?rewarded-from-page=8#related:currency-for;_!.<br><br>
Honor Points  500  / 1000  / 2000  - Along with all of the old sources of Honor, Ashran and other PvP activities provide several new opportunities to earn Honor.


Treasure Room Achievement Becoming a Feat of Strength
You can find this change, along with others in our Patch 6.0 Reminders post 
In WoW Patch 6.0.2, we will be retiring the Achievement In The Hall Of The Thunder King , as the treasure room will no longer be accessible. That achievement will become a Feat of Strength, and Elder Charm of Good Fortune  will drop in place of the key to the room.

can I ask why its being removed? I loved going through there on different toons! Just depressing seeing more things removed
the gold generation is really high once you can one-shot all the creatures inside
There's hardly crazy amounts of gold to be had there, though. Especially if gold is the "new Valor points" in Warlords
over 500 gold reliably once a week for minimal effort is significant
But it's been that way for nearly two years - why does it matter now?
at 100 the NPCs that do all the trappings are very easily killed, negating a lot of the challenge, esp in the last room Source 
notice could have been better though. i stopped farming keys on notion they weren’t going anywhere.
there is no reward exclusive to the treasure room unlike CMs or PVP seasons. Source 
Will the achievement be removed from the Isle of Thunder Meta? 
yep, the treasure room achievements will go legacy & removed from meta. Source 
Where will we get Elder Charms from then? The treasure run is the only source.
we'll add a conversion elsewhere.
Will the IoT vendors still sell items that help you in the treasure run?
yes, only the key drops are being removed. if you have find a key on an alt in 6 months you can still do the treasure room. Source 
However could we possibly as a suggestion see another version in a future patch maybe?
we would really love to do another one Source

is the T17 WW 4-piece's Forceful Wind additive or multiplicative? 10 stacks = 30% + 10% 40% or 30% * 1.1 33%
Mult. We buffed it a bit recently, to 3%/stack. Celestalon 

PvE
WoD World bosses, spawn time = current mop or mop launch? Rukhmar drops mount, would hate Mop-launch Galleon times
More like Sha of Anger. No plans on doing the Galleon/Oondasta-style respawn in the near future. WatcherDev 

CM Titles permanent in WoD? Seems best Gold time is a feat whether the first, or 3 tiers later. Or, 1 for current, 1 permanent?
No permanent title for best time in Warlords; if you want to keep the title, defend it. WatcherDev 

Are 30-player normal/heroic raids still planned for WoD?
Siege of Orgrimmar and all Warlords raids support raid sizes up to 30 on Normal/Heroic in 6.0, yes. WatcherDev 

100% looms in 6.0 is it per toon or player? If i have normal bow now if i do mythic in 6.0 will it be 100%?
Per character, per difficulty, so yes. WatcherDev 

PvP
Can we get some spec balance with queueing 3v3 skirmishes? Im tired of getting my dps getting paired with 2 more, into a healer/dps
Just a matter of who's queuing I.e. not enough healers. Alternative is DPS always have to wait. Prefer skirmishes be very fast. holinka 

Curious, how viable would it be to gear for PvP entirely through Ashran?
For honor, probably comparable time to bgs. For conquest, possible but slow when compared to arenas/RBGs. holinka 

Did you look into this? Any update?
I believe a 15-19 bracket is setup on beta/PTR. holinka 

Garrisons
You know, those healer and tank dummies that are in Shattarah on beta would be very nice in the garrison.
I thought the sparring arena had a healer/tank one, that incorrect? Muffinus 

Hi, i would like to know if you have the profession from the garrison building, you can have more than 1 daily cooldown.
The building has its own c/d, and you have your personal one, so you get both! Muffinus 

Since lvl 1 Dwarven Bunker doubles chance of quest rewards to rare / epic. Does it also affect followers gained from quests? 
It does not, they're not really considered an item, we'll take a look at adding this at some point Muffinus 

Meaning say without Barracks you can have a max 7 missions to do, and scouting would make it 8 total at one point. Or stay 7?
Looks like they are indeed in their own pools Muffinus
