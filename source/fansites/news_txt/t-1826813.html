Thistle Tea (http://www.wowdb.com/items/7676-thistle-tea) now gives NEGATIVE (-) 20 Energy when consumed. I hope this is a bug.<br>
Tooltip bug. It doesn&#x2019;t consume any energy, but it doesn&#x2019;t restore any either, at level 90+. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623665534182109184))<br>

btw serious question; as a mage when you try to pet nova on a mount is it intentional that it wont work until you get off the mount<br>
yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/623941732548280320))<br>

Can you please clarify what is affected by Sword of Light? Everything or only certain abilties?<br>
It affects most things, with a few exceptions. Conceptually it affects attacks with a weapon, even Judgment/Final Verdict. (1/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623666713847013376))<br>
But Exorcism and Holy Prism would not be affected, for example. (2/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623666756754784256))<br>

Legendary DPS ring doesn&apos;t seem to be counting damage done by searing totem/magma totem.<br>
Some totems are affected by the Legendary Rings a little unusually. They benefit twice from the damage increase... (1/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623668835686711296))<br>
...Instead of contributing to the explosion. Same total result. (2/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623668882889281536))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
Why can&apos;t i use Nithramus, the all-seer as mistweaver, i can equip it but when i try to use it it says item is not ready yet<br>
The Legendary Rings only work for their intended roll. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623668029201743872))<br>
<br>
Timewalking<br>
Why are we being scaled to iLV 160 in Wrath TW dungeons, which are the heroic versions? We&apos;re 40 iLVs below dungeon drops(1/2)<br>
Post-squish, that&#x2019;s close to an accurate ilvl. The feel of Wrath Timewalking is pretty authentic right now. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623664650714910720))<br>
<br>
Reputation / Questing<br>
Was said before 6.2 that the Celestial rep req. for Alani was going away soon. Is that in 6.2.1?<br>
Yes! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623653001400590337))<br>
<br>
If we clean Archimonde, then give back the 33 Tomes of Chaos. Can we still loot Crystallized Fel on a 2nd Arch kill same week?<br>
Unfortunately you cannot due to the way the tracking system works &#x2013; we&#x2019;re looking into future improvements here. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623665030957940736))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW and Game Design. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Dungeons<br>
But Ghostcrawler, (heroic) dungeons are hard! I really enjoyed the hard Cata dungeons most in the past few years<br>
Such an interesting time in my life. I couldn&apos;t motivate players to take on harder challenges and some never forgave me. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614860855079866368))<br>
<br>
World<br>
was the creation of vashj&apos;ir at all inspired by your PhD in marine science<br>
No, though I did suggest the artists add pognophorans, which they did. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614584337166512128))<br>
<br>
Game Design<br>
Do you think elitism is healthy for a MMORPG? And would you design endgame around it?<br>
I think *aspiration* is very healthy. Not sure that must lead to elitism. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/616339297474482176))<br>
<br>
Can&apos;t make content last longer, but you sure can make it last much shorter.<br>
I think you can make content longer *if* you add rewards. I think there is a magical time to reward ratio. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614575974718443520))<br>
<br>
So here&apos;s a question - how do you distinguish content as reward from drawing things out?<br>
I think there is almost an internal clock of being ready for a reward / something new. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614644925854912512))<br>
Which is why you can&apos;t just add time without also adding rewards, extrinsic or intrinsic. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614645099432034304))<br>
<br>
I avoid games that I know I won&#x2019;t be able to experience fully. Fallout 3, Skyrim, etc.<br>
Yes. Exactly. That&apos;s the problem I&apos;m trying to fix. I can&apos;t eat all this food so I&apos;m not even going to step inside the taqueria. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614654162672840704))<br>
<br>
That said I really love a game that&apos;s designed to be a single awesome 10-20 hour experience. Even a tad longer like DX:HR<br>
That&apos;s funny. I almost always play long games. I feel like short games aren&apos;t worth learning the rules. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614655247735091200))<br>
That is true even when it is an awesome short game so clearly it&apos;s not a rational conclusion on my part. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614655373308375041))<br>
<br>
I think there are short games and long games. To purposefully cut a long experience short seems wrong.<br>
But is Witcher 3 a short game with a lot of optional content or a long game? I&apos;d argue the former. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614655550127640576))<br>
<br>
What&apos;s wrong with being compelled to do something interesting/engaging? (especially when optional) Genuine question<br>
Often they won&apos;t do it. They will look at the lovingly created content, appreciate the effort, and go play a smaller game. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614850259475238912))<br>
Any examples? This is blowing my mind<br>
The 500 quests in Dragon Age Inquisition. Turned some folks off who didn&apos;t want to skip content but couldn&apos;t commit either. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614859312435826688))<br>
<br>
Substance. Substance is more important than these &quot;rewards&quot; it&apos;s all just an illusion of progress if it lacks substance.<br>
I&apos;m not sure I agree. Seeing a new room, earning a new piece of dialogue, or learning cut man&apos;s moves are all rewards. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614663133529944064))<br>
I don&apos;t think rewards are something dirty. I think they are why we find content compelling. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614663237699645440))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
if blizz offered you a completely absurd amount of money to come back to wow, would you?<br>
I am sure there is a number at which it would be dumb to say no. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s likely I will ever go back though (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/615378010166824960))<br>
