This means that almost all of the 1.2 million Annual Pass holders have now been invited to beta!<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ve sent the remaining 400,000 Annual Pass beta invites last night, which concludes the entirety of those who have signed up for the offer thus far. Of course the Annual Pass offer is still available (http://us.media.blizzard.com/wow/promotion/wap/en-us.html), providing those who sign up for a year of World of Warcraft with a special in-game mount, a beta invite for Mists of Pandaria, and a digital copy of Diablo III (http://www.battle.net/d3/). From here on out we&#x2019;ll be continuing to invite anyone else who signs up for the Annual Pass.<br>
<br>
See you in Pandaria (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/mists-of-pandaria/)!<br>
<br>
[edit] Due to the large number of invites sent there are some that bounced back for various reasons, and we&apos;ll be working to apply those invites over the next few days. If you haven&apos;t received your invite yet it&apos;s likely you&apos;re one of the few affected by such an issue, and rest assured we&apos;re working to get you into the beta as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience.</div></div>
