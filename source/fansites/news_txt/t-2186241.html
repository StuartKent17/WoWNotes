Heroes of the Storm - Primal Flamesaber Promotion Extended<br>
You&apos;ve got a little bit longer to earn that Primal Flamesaber mount (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6317-Heroes-of-the-Storm-Promotion-Primal-Flamesaber)!<br>
Update: For Azeroth! Event Temporarily Returns<br>
<br>
Our recent &#x201C;For Azeroth!&#x201D; in-game event that concluded on Tuesday, March 14, came to an end a few hours earlier than we told you it would. As a result, a number of players who were still racing to unlock their mounts weren&#x2019;t able to finish the quest in time, and we&#x2019;d like to make it up to you. We&#x2019;ve decided to extend the quest by a few days so that everyone has time to complete their games and claim their rewards.<br>
