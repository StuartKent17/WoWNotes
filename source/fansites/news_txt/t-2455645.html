Here you&apos;ll find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to World of Warcraft: Battle For Azeroth. Some of the hotfixes below take effect the moment they were implemented, while others may require scheduled realm restarts to go into effect. Please keep in mind that some issues cannot be addressed without a client-side patch update. This list will be updated as additional hotfixes are applied.<br>

Beast Mastery<br>
<br>
Fixed a bug with Spirit Mend (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/90361-spirit-mend) that caused it to heal for less than intended.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeons and Raids<br>
<br>
Uldir<br>
<br>
Zul, Reborn<br>
<br>
Zul&apos;s health has been reduced by 5% on Mythic difficulty.<br>
Developers&#x2019; note: Tides of Vengeance removed the Subtlety Rogue passive Shuriken Combo, which was a core part of many guilds&#x2019; strategy on this fight. We&#x2019;re reducing Zul&#x2019;s health to avoid the update increasing the difficulty of the fight for guilds that were relying on Shuriken Combo.<br>

Fixed a bug that allowed some Battle For Azeroth crafted gear to be worn by player characters who no longer had the crafting skill to create it.<br>

Battle for Azeroth flasks and feasts now increase the primary stat for tanks (was Stamina).<br>
