Legion - Mana Cost Indicator<br>
In Legion, the default UI will now visually show you how much mana the spell you are casting will cost, similar to how shields show up on the health bar.<br>

Mana Tap talent looks exactly like Soulburn Haunt, Improved Soulfire 4.0. An obligatory buff to maintain.<br>
Do you think talents are a good place for gameplay styles that some people enjoy and some people don&apos;t? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/704579767786299392))<br>
<br>
I&apos;m gonna ask you a question anyway.Can hunters please tame rams? Something for my hunter to have along side his mount.<br>
Usually we try to add models that have had uprezzes these days, maybe someday (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704942719215468544))<br>
Good to know. When I caught a glimpse of the PvP Ram, my Dwarf-o-meter went off and I wanted to see more of that high-rez glory.<br>
Yaks are close! And fuzzy. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704943141976195072))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
when will blizz fix the undead model and by model I mean scaling of gear (or how it looks on Undead vs other race). #SHOULDERSRSOSMALLSADFACE<br>
are you seriously a player playing a warcraft game complaining that your shoulders are too small (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704956236567949312))<br>
on Undead, yes! On everyone else, no! Plate gear on undead looks so &quot;spread out&quot; and not compact.<br>
One of them definitely hangs off of the shoulder a bit, thanks for the feedback. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704956840128356352))<br>
<br>
will T18 set bonuses be adjusted once the Legion prepatch drops? Several modify talents that won&apos;t exist or will have moved<br>
Yes. The set bonuses for Tier 18 will be adjusted. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705190332879630337))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
What is AV/Wintergrasp lasted an hour or two? You&apos;d talk with the peeps.<br>
Ashran was a Good Experiment. Drove PvP forward, got feedback, glad we did it. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704948022283739138))<br>
And I&apos;m not sure this is 100% true, I loved 48 hour AV (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704948408893743105))<br>
<br>
The amount of honor per level increases every 10 levels. At the moment, going from 1-50 takes 50,000 honor. (1/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705482012723818496))<br>
Leveling through the honor system is a point of emphasis for us right now, so we are open to feedback! (2/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705482094454026240))<br>

Lore<br>
Saw General Tiras&apos;alan in the Paladin Class Hall during an alpha Stream. Think he died during the Theramore Bombing, no?<br>
Sounds like we have an imposter in our midst... Thanks for the heads up! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705183220225040384))<br>

Misc<br>
or do the Devs want to make wow into a different game? What&apos;s the deal here?<br>
Games evolve with time, the challenge is evolving with the userbase. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704943426471645186))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
then again the group finder makes it as trivial to find random group and it works. I am not getting you entirely here.<br>
The point of group content is to work together as a group. Excellent matchmaking works against that because it&apos;s so easy to bail. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/706924287878279168))<br>
As a player, sure it&apos;s easier if you don&apos;t have to communicate and just hit a button to find another group. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/706924365691035648))<br>
But is that healthy in the long run? Why have a multiplayer game if everyone plays it as a single-player game, you know? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/706924465037266944))<br>
<br>
Was there originally a plan for Crystalsong Forest in WOTLK? Seems to desolate...<br>
I think it was Dalaran, which was in that zone, being too much of a resource hog. Was long ago - I may be misremembering. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/706924965099012096))<br>

Poll - Dalaran Pronunciation<br>
Muffinus is asking the critical questions (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/705238964488138752). How do you pronounce Dalaran?<br>
