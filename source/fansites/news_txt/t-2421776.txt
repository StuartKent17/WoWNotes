Easy Way to Level Kul Tiran/Zandalari Cooking to 110
JordanTH  on Reddit discovered an easy way to level Kul Tiran/Zandalari Cooking to 110  using only vendor items. 


You can learn Rank 1 of Mon'Dazi  from your Cooking trainer.
Purchase enough for about 200 crafts 2000 Wild Flour , 1000 Foosaka , 400 Aromatic Fish Oil , and 800 Powdered Sugar  
You can buy all of these reagents from either Henrick Wyther  A or Hanul Swiftgalep  H.
Be sure to go and learn Rank 2 Mon'Dazi  at 35 Cooking.
You can make 100 Mon'Dazi  and 100 Kul Tiramisu  by swapping out about 400 Powdered Sugar  for Major's Frothy Coffee  to use on Bountiful Captain's Feast  later.

Dungeon Queue Times
Sorry but 2 hour que times are unacceptable. when are you bringing out the hotfix?
We're working on a hotfix now that will automatically respec anyone who can tank or heal into those specs. If you're a Monk, Paladin, or Druid we're just going to spin a wheel and see where you land. This should drastically reduce the DPS queue time so that its an instant queue.

In case it wasn't clear this was very sarcastic. Queue times are fine! Just a lack of tank and heals because they're probably with static groups, also lots of people are still leveling. Even queuing solo DPS for heroics my queue time max has been actually 30 mins but estimated says around an hour. It's just an estimation Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Azerite System Feedback
Surely im not the only one who feels this way? The azerite gear is essentially the netherlight crucible. Most traits are passive and boring. Does it get better as the xpac goes on or..?
Some of the default Azerite items from questing don't have a lot of variety because you're still leveling up. Once you're at 120 and getting them from vendors, WQs, and dungeons you start seeing a lot more variety and some pretty neat stuff. 

Like there's one for Ret that reduces the cooldown of Divine Steed and it gives a speed buff to your entire raid when you use it. Which I thought was pretty rad.

It's definitely early, but I'm eager to see how it plays out and how this system shapes up as well as what else we might do with it. It has potential, and I'm pretty excited about that alone as a player. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Allied Race Recruit-a-Friend and Heritage Armor
If your friend grants levels to one of your Allied Race characters, it makes your character ineligible to receive the Heritage Armor.

If you grant levels to one of your friend's characters, that won't effect your eligibility for the armor.

But only the recruited player accumulates levels that can be granted, so that would be your friend. If they were to grant any of those levels onto your Void Elf, that would make your Void Elf ineligible for the armor. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 


This Week in WoW History
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.

Mists of Pandaria Cinematic
The world premier of the Mists of Pandaria opening cinematic was shown in 2012. After an intense battle the Alliance and Horde soldier find themselves shipwrecked on an unknown island. Naturally they continue their battle, but a mysterious third party shows up.


 

Siege of Orgrimmar Trailer
After obtaining the Heart of Y’shaarj, Garrosh Hellscream aims to corrupt the land and form his own Horde. Taran Zhu confronts him to try and stop his plans, but is defeated in battle. Both factions will need to pick up arms to lay siege to Orgrimmar, and defeat the corrupted Garrosh.


 

Premade Groups
The Premade Group Finder was announced as an addition to Warlords of Draenor. Perhaps one of the most useful features that have been recently added, it allows players to create custom groups and search for players who want to achieve the same goal. As new content is added, this feature continues to evolve to make it easy for players to find each other.


 

Warlords of Draenor Cinematic
The announcement cinematic for Warlords of Draenor was released in 2014. In the short trailer, Gul’dan offers Mannoroth's blood to Garrosh Hellscream, who refuses to drink it and be lost to its corruption. His Horde attack the Pit Lord, and with a decisive blow Garrosh finishes him. 


 

The Last Bastion
Overwatch has been releasing lore videos for several of the heroes. Bastion wakes in a forest, covered by dirt and plants. After reaching his target location he remembers what happened. War and devastation during the Omnic Crisis, in which he fought, left him with painful memories. Even though he was damaged in the initial fight, after downloading the memories of a different unit, he starts marching towards his target.
