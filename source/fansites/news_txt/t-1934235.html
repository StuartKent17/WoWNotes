Legion - Magni, Eitrigg, and The Ashbringer<br>
We found some interesting conversations with important NPCs about Artifact weapons. One example is a conversation you can have with Magni or Eitrigg about The Ashbringer. Unfortunately there isn&apos;t much more than what is below yet. Keep in mind that this is just a reference in an alpha build of Legion, not something final or officially announced.<br>
<br>
Magni Bronzebeard and The Ashbringer<br>
Well if ain&apos;t the Highlord $Ghimself:herself;! I reckon&apos; it&apos;s good for even the hardiest of us to take a moment and reflect now and again. I&apos;m right fond of this spot. <br>
Take a seat with me for a moment, won&apos;t ye? <br>
The Ashbringer is a truly wondrous blade, ain&apos;t it? I remember forging it many years ago back in Ironforge - my finest work. <br>
If ye don&apos;t mind an old dwarf talkin&apos; yer ear off, I&apos;d like to share a piece of advice with ye that I&apos;ve carried with me since I was a lad. <br>
We all come from the same earth and stone around us; Alliance and Horde, dwarf and gnome- as a leader, ye&apos;ve got to see past the differences and unite yer people against the Legion. Azeroth depends on it. <br>
I&apos;ll give ye some time alone. Just somethin&apos; to think about in the days ahead. <br>
<br>
Eitrigg and The Ashbringer<br>
Throm-Ka, Highlord $p. I see we both value some peace and quiet now and again. <br>
Sit with me if you would - just for a few moments. <br>
Tirion was my brother by blood. We saved one another&apos;s lives many moons ago. He was a good man... an honorable man. <br>
He always thought highly of you - from what I hear from others his trust has not been misplaced. <br>
I have watched many lead their people down dark paths. Tirion often spoke of the Light that guided his hand and his people - let it guide you to greatness as well. <br>
I am not one for conversation - much remains to be done. May our paths cross again, $p. <br>

Blue Tweets<br>
Transmogrification<br>
Will Rogues have the ability to mog their artifact weapons into other stuff?This being outlaws with axes and fist weps<br>
You can transmogrify your artifact into other weapons within the current, existing transmogrification weapon-type rules. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/685267638847553536))<br>
<br>
<br>
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Prestige based on luck has no real value. Give me prestige based on skill and/or dedication.<br>
Neither skill nor dedication will provide an item that only a few players will own. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685553129270591488))<br>
Maybe having a super rare item like that just isn&apos;t feasible. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685553196710801408))<br>
<br>
Why in Cata post mortem you said Legendaries should not be like a reputation grind and Mists had 3 Rep grinds for Legendary?<br>
Different legendaries. Cataclysm model was 1-2 per guild raid. Mists legendaries were for virtually everyone. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552086566633472))<br>
This is relevant to the discussion of rarity we&apos;ve been having on twitter lately. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552256897318913))<br>
Say as a designer you want 1% of players to have an item for prestige or bragging purposes. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552450275639296))<br>
RNG is about the only tool in your box. along grind doesn&apos;t limit number of players, only the rate they acquire them. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552636209172480))<br>
Skill means the world first guilds have them and nobody else. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552706333720576))<br>
Systems to deliver rare rewards in the absence of low RNg-based drop rates are *very* hard to design. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552935112060928))<br>
