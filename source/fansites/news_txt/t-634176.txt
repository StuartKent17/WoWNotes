Love is in the Air! Be careful because it seems that love isn't around for long in World of Warcraft: this event will start on February 11 at 06:00AM and end on February 16 at 06:00AM. Server time 

The Fool for Love http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1693 meta-achievement is obviously a part of the What A Long, Strange Trip It's Been http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2145 achievement to get the Violet Proto-Drake http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/september/8970/mount_violetprotodrake.jpg 310% Speed Flying Mount.

Most of these achievements are easily completed because they rely heavily on items found in Gifts of Adorations http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration and Pledge of Adoration http://www.wowhead.com/?search=pledge+of+adoration. You can easily get them and you can also buy them from other players at the Auction House if you're running short on time. 

Heartmender http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=260
Use the Unbestowed Friendship Bracelets http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22259 on 20 players affected by the Heartbroken http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=26898 debuff. You can find the bracelets inside the Gift of Adorations http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration you get when you offer a Love Token http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21815 to a guard in capital cities. 

http://static.wowhead.com/images/alliance-icon.gifNation of Adoration http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1697 / http://static.wowhead.com/images/horde-icon.gifNation of Adoration http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1698
Get a Gift of Adorations http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration from each capital city. 

Tokens http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21815 are bought from Innkeepers during the event. Giving a token to a guard will affect you with the Adored http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=26680 debuff and will reward you with a Gift of Adorations http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration. This won't work all the time, you can also get the Heartbroken http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=26898 debuff and in this case you just won't get anything. You can cancel the Heartbroken debuff with a Unbestowed Friendship Bracelets http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22259 ... Which is the whole point of the achievement! Just make other players happy! 

Flirt with Disaster http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1279
Drink enough alcohol to be completely smashed, buy a Perfume Bottle http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21829 from the closest Innkeeper selling it, and use your Bouquet of Red Roses http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22206 or Bouquet of Ebon Roses http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44731 on either 
http://static.wowhead.com/images/alliance-icon.gifSraaz http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=9099 or http://static.wowhead.com/images/horde-icon.gifJeremiah Payson http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=8403 depending on your faction. 

Nearest and Dearest http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1695
Buy some Perfume http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21829 or Cologne http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21833 along with a few Love Tokens http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21815 and complete the http://static.wowhead.com/images/alliance-icon.gifDangerous Love http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=8903 or http://static.wowhead.com/images/horde-icon.gifDangerous Love http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=8904 questline depending on your faction. They're simple delivery quests and you shouldn't have any problem with that. 

Sweet Tooth http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1702
Eat a Buttermilk Delight http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22236, Dark Desire http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22237, Sweet Surprise http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22239 and a Very Berry Cream http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22238. All these items are found in the Box of Chocolate http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21812 contained in Gifts of Adorations http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration and Pledge of Adoration http://www.wowhead.com/?search=pledge+of+adoration. If you plan to do the other achievements this one won't be a problem as you'll have plenty of them available. 

My Love is Like a Red, Red Rose http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1703
Obtain a Bouquet of Red Roses http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22206 or Bouquet of Ebon Roses http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44731.
The Bouquet of Red Roses http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22206 was found on Archivist Galford http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=10811 Stratholme, Illyanna Ravenoak http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=11488 Dire Maul, Princess Moira Bronzebeard http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=8929 Blackrock Depths and Lorekeeper Polkelt http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=10901 but is no longer obtainable 
The Bouquet of Ebon Roses http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44731 is found on Maiden of Grief http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=27975 Halls of Stone, Prince Keleseth http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=23953 Utgarde Keep and Prince Taldaram http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=29308. 

Shafted! http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1188
Use Silver Shafted Arrow http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22200 on 10 players, once again you can find this item in the Gifts of Adorations http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration and Pledge of Adoration http://www.wowhead.com/?search=pledge+of+adoration and it should be pretty easy to have enough of them to complete the achievement. If you really need more arrows you can also complete the Alliance Gift Collection http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22262/Horde Gift Collection http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22263 and complete the quest http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=8981 to get 5 extra arrows but it's going to waste a LOT of your time. 

Lonely? http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1291
Join someone for a picnic in Dalaran! This will require a Romantic Picnic Basket http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34480, this is a rare drop from Gifts of Adorations http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration and Pledges of Adoration http://www.wowhead.com/?search=pledge+of+adoration. If you're not lucky with droprates, you can still find someone with the basket and share a picnic with him/her to complete your achievement. 

The Rocket's Pink Glare http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1696
Shoot off 10 Love Rockets http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34258 in 20 seconds or less. This is another easy achievement, you can find the rockets in Gifts of Adorations http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration and Pledges of Adoration http://www.wowhead.com/?search=pledge+of+adoration. 

Fistful of Love http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1699

Hunter Ammo Changes partially removed from Patch 3.1.0
In our 3.1.0 class updates post, we had announced plans to remove consumable ammunition from the game upon the release of the next major content patch. Our original plans were to change ammunition so that hunters would no longer need to utilize bag space, while adding some new functionality that would continue to make ammunition a compelling element of gameplay. Unfortunately, this intended change will not be completely ready in time for patch 3.1.0.

We still fully intend to move forward with this change when the additional functionality becomes available, and for 3.1.0 we still intend to remove the need for pouches/quivers by greatly increasing the stack sizes on arrows and bullets, and the haste bonus from the bags will be preserved in another fashion. We’ll be sure to inform our players with further updates once they become available.

Unintentional instance saving
We did speak with some of the developers about this recently. While I'm unable to comment on your specific suggestions, I'll say we were all in agreement that something needs to change with raid IDs. On the one hand, we are happy that pick-up groups have a wider array of options at their disposal, whether it be 5, 10, or 25 man content. On the other hand though, it's currently too easy to end up saved to an instance that's been cleared, or close to it, without knowing ahead of time this will happen.

We've been looking at player feedback in this regard, and are working to develop a better interface to warn players that will be saved to an instance that's been partially, or completely cleared. This is something that might not happen in 3.1, but we'll be discussing this further internally in the near future. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14990463457-saved-i-hate-raid-ids.html

Savage Defense
It isn't intended as a buff or nerf per se. As many players have surmised, we want to make gearing as a bear tank more interesting, yet we don't have a lot of room to expand on stamina, dodge or armor. In this case the specific numbers are not as important as the general idea, though we also think the specific numbers are a really good place to start.

Plans to changes hunter ammos in 3.1.0 cancelled
One of the things we have been trying to do more of is give players a sneak peak at what we are working on. The risk of course is that players become disappointed or even outraged when some of the changes don't come to pass. The traditional Blizzard tight-lipped responses and invocation of "soon" are partially for this reason. It used to be that everyone found out about class changes through patch notes.

Blizzard uses the development model of iterative design more than almost anyone else in the industry. We go through a ton of changes before you see a fraction of them. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14990442844-hunters--when-addtl-tech-is-avail.html

Arcane Barrage Nerfed
A last minute change was made to the mage Arcane Barrage spell which reduced its spell power coefficient. This change did not make it into the 3.0.9 patch notes. We will be carefully evaluating this change and its effects on game balance in both PvE and PvP. If you have constructive feedback to provide, please do so in this thread.

Hymns
Keep in mind that the changes we listed as a possible for the future patch are just a short list. I believe Ghostcrawler did say that Hymns are something we'd like to look at, but I couldn't say specifically if anything is planned for them just yet.

Warlock Pets
We're looking into making further improvements though there is no current ETA for these pets, however, specifics haven't been locked down. We'll let you know when more information becomes available on this subject. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14990913818-warlock-pets.html
