chaud2011-08-10, 04:25 AMStats - Character Gender Ratios
News has been slow and we've been looking at building random stats to keep you interested! We're still working on the juicy stuff but let's start with character gender ratios!

You might think that Female Dwarves are player's least favorite female model, but you would be mistaken! Female Orcs take the lead by a few percent margin in our poll of Level 85 characters.

Tier 11 Shoulders and Head for Justice Points
Sometimes raids don't go our way. Sometimes drops don't go our way. I think anyone who has ever farmed for a mount or a particular piece of gear has had a similar experience and, while not getting a drop can be frustrating, one hopes that delayed gratification adds a little savor when you finally do obtain the object of your desire. Good things really do come to those who wait, or at least, exercise persistence and patience.

I should add that, unlike the olden days, you aren't leaving empty handed from any boss encounter, and you can spend the Valor Points you're obtaining to acquire even more powerful gear. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 


We Want Your Comics!
We’ve spent 8 years adding awesome community comics to our Comics section , but we’re far from finished. We’re looking for the best new World of Warcraft comics to become front page news on our site, and we’d love to have your help, whether you’re a seasoned contributor or a first-time cartoonist. If you’d like to have your comic displayed on our website, submit it here  Blue Tracker  / Official Blog 


API - HTML scraping no longer allowed
This is important to anyone who is still scraping the new Armory HTML, as it will break anything that relies on doing so.
Now that the API is live, we want to make you all aware that HTML datamining via us.battle.net/wow or any of the other regional wow sites is not acceptable. Within the next 7 days, we will start to blacklist users that are making excessive requests to our regular community sites.

If you are currently in the process of porting over to the API and have not requested a key yet, please do so. We do not want to interrupt service for community sites that are following that path.

Unless you're making 1000s of requests a day, its unlikely you'll get caught up in this. This is highly unlikely to apply to blue tracker sites Assuming they are doing it sensibly, or personal guild sites.
