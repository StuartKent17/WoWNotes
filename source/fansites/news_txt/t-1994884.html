Character Copy is Disabled<br>
Please note that Character Copy is currently disabled in Beta builds. The button is currently not grayed out, but trying to copy account data will fail.<br>
<br>
We&apos;ll announce when Character Copy is enabled. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/411717-character-copy-is-disabled/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743706206?page=1#1))<br>
<br>
Premade Characters in Legion Beta<br>
Right now the initial focus of the Beta test will be on stress testing the Legion starting experience, as well as collecting feedback regarding the levelling experience as a whole, so there will no level 110 premades to begin with. That is to say, a very real part of this test is how our content and servers handle this surge of people in a few locations. Even if there are issues, know that highlighting those issues now is very important and useful to Legion&apos;s development! <br>
<br>
So if you crash the servers or break content in new and unique ways please take pride in that and we&apos;ll fix the issues as fast as we can.<br>
<br>
Once the scope of testing shifts to other aspects of the expansion, then additional types of premades might be introduced to allow further focused testing.

<br>
PvP Realm and Beta<br>
I like this a lot. Consider forcing 3s too when skirms come about, I think 2v2 double dps battles give a bad impression of the pacing and excluded a lot of specs from real testing (games are almost always over right after or during offensive &amp; defensive CDs).<br>
This is simply due to the number of healers queuing. If there were enough healers, the matches would be all 3s. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/411393-pvp-realm-and-beta-launch/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743795107?page=1#7))<br>

Activision Blizzard Media Networks Announces Esports Broadcast Network<br>
You may remember that Activision Blizzard acquired MLG earlier this year (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5404-Holy-Paladin-Artifact-Weapon-Preview-Tweets-Activision-Blizzard-and-MLG-Fan-Art). Now we know a little bit more about what they are doing with it.<br>
Today at the IAB Digital Content NewFronts 2016, Activision Blizzard Media Networks (ABMN), a division of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATVI), announced the launch of new content, broadcast experiences and distribution partnerships for its MLG.tv streaming platform. <br>
<br>
MLG.tv debuted its Enhanced Viewing Experience (EVE) at the event, a High-Definition video stream with a built-in algorithmic system that provides viewers with match statistics, up-to-the-minute leaderboards and situational insights based on the competition they are watching.<br>
<br>
Steve Bornstein, Chairman of ABMN and former CEO of ESPN, took the stage to introduce the network&#x2019;s host, veteran broadcaster and retired professional gamer Chris Puckett. As host of MLG.tv&#x2019;s daily ESR broadcast, Puckett will produce up-to-the-minute premium highlights, interviews and news segments for a new generation of sports fans.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We&#x2019;re building a network dedicated to the thrill of competition and the passion of the fans,&#x201D; said Bornstein. &#x201C;MLG.tv will play a defining role in realizing the full potential of this audience by creating meaningful, memorable and shareable content.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Esports is a cultural phenomenon at its tipping point, and we&#x2019;re excited to work with the IAB to bring this message directly to advertisers as part of the 2016 Digital Content NewFronts,&#x201D; said Mike Sepso, Senior Vice President of ABMN. &#x201C;The size of our digital network, coupled with our insights into this audience&#x2019;s viewing habits, put us in a unique position to educate the advertising industry on how to safely target these viewers and reach them on their platform of choice.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
ABMN will launch this content and more during the MLG Anaheim Open, a two-day Call of Duty&#xAE;: Black Ops III tournament set to kick off on June 10, 2016. The MLG Anaheim Open will also be the inaugural event as part of a deeper collaboration with Facebook. The collaboration will allow MLG.tv to broadcast live competitions and deliver ESR content to the 1.6 billion people on Facebook.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Esports is an exciting space and continues to be a growing priority for us,&#x201D; said Dan Reed, Head of Global Sports Partnerships for Facebook. &#x201C;With over 1.6 billion people on the platform and a growing suite of VOD and live streaming products that partners can use to increase engagement, Facebook is uniquely positioned to help esports fans connect around exciting moments and great esports content. We&#x2019;re thrilled to be working with Activision Blizzard Media Networks, a leader in esports, to help fans enjoy and share a variety of exciting new formats and programming on our platform.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
ABMN&#x2019;s NewFronts presentation opened with a video showcasing the division&#x2019;s record-breaking live championship held last month at Nationwide Arena. Sepso and Puckett were joined by Josh Cella, ABMN&#x2019;s Head of Sales, to present the new content and advertising opportunities to a packed house at the PlayStation Theater in Times Square. <br>
