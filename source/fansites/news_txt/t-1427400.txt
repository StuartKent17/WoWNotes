Warlords of Draenor Stats and Items
Will there be any secondary stats besides armor that will be useless to healers?
Nope, all secondaries besides Bonus Armor will be useful to healers. Source 

From what I gather tank will have a unique secondary armor and healers spirit, do DPS get a unique secondary?
Current plan is no. Source 

Now, absorbs can shield for ~10% of your health, instead of ~24% - more room for direct heals 3/3
You guys are making incorrect assumptions about how much health pools are being squished. Source 
Are the health levels we saw at Blizzcon not a good indicator?
Not sure what was in the BlizzCon build. Important bit: Base health is gone. All HP = Stam. Source 
And how does that work with freshly created characters who have no gear? Dumb idea.
No gear doesn't mean no Stamina. Characters have base Stamina. Source 
Forgive me but I thought those things were exactly the same thing.
Nope, very different. Source 
Can you link an explanation? The stuff I can find pairs the two terms together.
Not sure what you're asking. There's currently base health and base stam. Base health is going away. All health will be from stam Source 

Saw the comments on stamina. How will this affect Tauren with their Endurance racial?
That's why I previously said that the ones guaranteed to be changed were the hit, exp, and basehealth ones. It'll be changed. Source 

Blizzcon screenshots seem to show Player HP = STA x 25
I believe it reaches 30 HP per Sta at lvl 100. Source 

Future
Can we hope to see an ingame model of this  one day? It would be awesome !
cool drawing-not unless we revisit current Outland at some point. Broken aren't natural species on Draenor - demon influence. Source 

Can you talk about DoTA style bg? Is it cancelled? Nonthing was said about it at blizzcon
No plans for it right now. Maybe we'll revisit it in the future. Felt very "me too" with respect to the DotA trend. Source 

soooooo, will we have another season this exp or no?
We have it in our back pocket if we feel like we need it. Source
