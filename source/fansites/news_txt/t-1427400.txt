Warlords of Draenor Stats and Items
Will there be any secondary stats besides armor that will be useless to healers?
Nope, all secondaries besides Bonus Armor will be useful to healers. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407604772049391616

From what I gather tank will have a unique secondary armor and healers spirit, do DPS get a unique secondary?
Current plan is no. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407649401700491264

Now, absorbs can shield for ~10% of your health, instead of ~24% - more room for direct heals 3/3
You guys are making incorrect assumptions about how much health pools are being squished. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407338900361728001
Are the health levels we saw at Blizzcon not a good indicator?
Not sure what was in the BlizzCon build. Important bit: Base health is gone. All HP = Stam. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407340330170593280
And how does that work with freshly created characters who have no gear? Dumb idea.
No gear doesn't mean no Stamina. Characters have base Stamina. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407340754315395072
Forgive me but I thought those things were exactly the same thing.
Nope, very different. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407341541024223232
Can you link an explanation? The stuff I can find pairs the two terms together.
Not sure what you're asking. There's currently base health and base stam. Base health is going away. All health will be from stam Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407349379079491585

Saw the comments on stamina. How will this affect Tauren with their Endurance racial?
That's why I previously said that the ones guaranteed to be changed were the hit, exp, and basehealth ones. It'll be changed. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407638027926646784

Blizzcon screenshots seem to show Player HP = STA x 25
I believe it reaches 30 HP per Sta at lvl 100. Source https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407341271942852608

Future
Can we hope to see an ingame model of this http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/186/6/5/female_broken_by_iseijin-d3l1rwg.jpg one day? It would be awesome !
cool drawing-not unless we revisit current Outland at some point. Broken aren't natural species on Draenor - demon influence. Source https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/407978925441028096

Can you talk about DoTA style bg? Is it cancelled? Nonthing was said about it at blizzcon
No plans for it right now. Maybe we'll revisit it in the future. Felt very "me too" with respect to the DotA trend. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407588364741664768

soooooo, will we have another season this exp or no?
We have it in our back pocket if we feel like we need it. Source https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407589250842902528
