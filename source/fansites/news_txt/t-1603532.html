Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons: Town Hall / Great Hall<br>
Today we are taking a look at the Town Hall / Great Hall building. This building is a central part of your garrison, where missions take place and where building configurations are changed. <br>
<br>
Upgrading your Town Hall / Great Hall to Level 3 currently costs (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/36615-my-very-own-castle) 2000 Garrison Resources (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/824-garrison-resources) and &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;5000&lt;/span&gt;.<br>
<br>
Town Hall / Great Hall NPCs<br>
Along with the Architect and Mission Specialist, there are a few other interesting NPCs.<br> 
<br>
<br>
Blueprints Vendor - This NPC sells blueprints and prices have changed since we last looked at them (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4056-Stormwind-Repairs-Reagent-Bank-Blueprint-Prices-New-Quests-and-Items-Hogger-Pet). <br>

<br>
Daily Mission<br>
A choice between a solo mission and group mission (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests?filter-currency=-1&amp;filter-search=assault&amp;filter-reqlvl-min=100) is given to you in your Town Hall / Great Hall every day, with the solo mission rewarding 800 Apexis Crystal (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/823-apexis-crystal) and the group mission rewarding 1000 Apexis Crystal (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/823-apexis-crystal).<br>
<br>
When you arrive at the area, you must fill a progress bar to 100% (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/objectives.jpg) by killing mobs and interacting with objects in the area. Depending on the quest, mobs may give ~1 percent each while objects will give you ~2-3 percent each.<br>

Tank Squish Changes<br>
So basically you&apos;re saying that after this change that you just spoke of...<br>
<br>
1). We will self-heal a lot more in solo/out of combat (so that Ret isn&apos;t more survivable than Prot and it ain&apos;t taking us 60+ seconds to heal up after combat)<br>
2). We will self-heal about the same during raid content (so tanks aren&apos;t overpowered like in MoP)<br>
<br>
Is that about right?<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
Any thoughts on Resolve&apos;s scaling at high levels of damage taken? As of right now, we&apos;re getting pretty absurd levels of it in raid situations; even the mythic tank dummy with no stacks takes us about 80-85% of the way to the hard cap on our healing. I don&apos;t agree with the folks that say to make it linear (since there needs to be something to account for our better gear scaling this expansion), but even I think that Resolve&apos;s scaling is pitiful at high levels of damage taken.<br>
Vengeance was a huge additive increase on a trivial base amount.<br>
<br>
Resolve is a multiplier on a very significant base amount that grows with gear. As your gear improves, that multiplier needs to grow slower in order to produce the same effect. Your gear improving will make those smaller increases in Resolve more meaningful.

get silver, but then get 430 heroics gear first? or if geared enough for heroics geared enough 4 gold?<br>
It&apos;s the same for all difficulties. You want ilvl 615 for max effectiveness at level 100 (Normal dungeon gear). (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/517024908853772288))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
a question: lately i&apos;ve heard that soo mythic will be cross-realm. Does that mean WoD&apos;s mythic will be so?<br>
New Mythic tiers will not be cross-realm; that restriction will be removed after some time, likely when the next tier arrives. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/516813548446826496))<br>
<br>
...isn&apos;t Mythic aimed for 5 and rarely 4 or 6? I think mentioned something like that earlier this year.<br>
Yes, we view 5 as the target. We&apos;ll likely bump the raid damage on several fights that were being widely 4-healed. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/516986787193819136))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
hey I had seen the ranked arena games are ending when 6.0.2 goes live does this mean conquest gear will be available for honor?<br>
Yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/516041874344116224))<br>
<br>
Hey, whats happening to Duels resetting cooldowns? Was very excited for this, but hasn&apos;t been working for as long as I&apos;ve had beta<br>
It won&apos;t be ready for Warlords release. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/516694248989552640))<br>
<br>
you snuck resilience into the latest build under the name &quot;player damage reduction level 100&quot;?<br>
It&apos;s a bit inside baseball but we may need baseline resil at lower levels and we need that buff to remove it at higher levels. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/516972593560453122))<br>
still no plans for resilience at level 100. Damage pacing feels right for the most part. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/516972806366830592))<br>
<br>
Will Skirmishes be available in 6.0?<br>
yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517006999595544577))<br>
<br>
will players be able to earn honor/anything else from skirmishes in 6.0.2?<br>
yes honor (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517017291020853250))<br>
<br>
Dont think it&apos;d be a good experience for people who want to pracctice<br>
Playing skirmishes to practice for arena is analogous to playing random bgs to practice rated bgs. Not recommended (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517019038430801920))<br>
you will have a hidden MMR but high end players should not expect as high level play as rated (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517019509086257152))<br>
<br>
Lore<br>
Are we going to see the Mantid again? There were a million things you guys did right with em, I couldn&apos;t list them all on twitter<br>
They&apos;re pretty local to Pandaria. I doubt you&apos;ll see much of them anywhere else, but you never know. They can fly, after all. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/516778051469066241))<br>
<br>
How is Khadgar &quot;tirion esque&quot; you mean Cata thrall esque? because he&apos;s an alliance character.<br>
He&apos;s leading a coalition of Alliance and Horde forces on Draenor. So, pretty much exactly what Tirion did in Wrath. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517055094248861696))<br>
Or rather, he&apos;s trying to get them to cooperate against the Iron Horde. Both factions interact with him to some degree. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517055719627956225))<br>
<br>
World<br>
Not sure if you&apos;re the right person to ask this but is Timeless Isle sticking around going into #Warlords?<br>
Yep, it&apos;s not going anywhere. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/516252025982840832))<br>
and it isn&apos;t changing? so for instance I can go do all the stuff I never did in MoP in WoD!<br>
Other than some specific things like the legendary questline, everything from Mists will remain for you to explore. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/516253721098211328))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
If you change your garrison outpost , you&apos;ll get a new questline with a new follower, right?<br>
No, we didn&apos;t want you to have to &quot;collect them all&quot; by systematically replacing each outpost. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/516623617812348928))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
Yay! Another Blizz representative that&apos;s horde ...and you guys still try to deny the bias, pffft!<br>
Actually, the WoW dev team has a pretty even split of Horde and Alliance players. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517024689131360258))<br>
