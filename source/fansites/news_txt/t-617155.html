Here are the changes we&apos;re making next patch. See how they feel.<br>
<br>
Wild Growth: Coefficient and healing increased. Mana cost decreased. Cost should be about the same as Circle of Healing. It doesn&apos;t heal instantly, but will heal for about double what CoH does over its duration.<br>
<br>
Nourish: Reduced mana cost by somewhere between 15 and 20%. This is supposed to be your Flash Heal, but we recognize that it doesn&apos;t have the same versatility -- you can&apos;t just drop one on a wounded rogue or something since you need the hot up first. Hence the lower price.<br>
<br>
Druids have quite an arsenal of healing spells now, and it can be tricky to find niches for all of them. <br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/shaman.jpg Shaman - Enhancement changes<br>
Here are our concerns: Lavaburst makes scaling from spell damage so good that Enhancement shamans were debating wearing Elemental gear. Enhancement shamans were also looking at using caster daggers to maximize procs. Both of these trends would cause us severe item headaches down the road and also don&apos;t fit the kit of the tree.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re changing Maestrom Weapon to no longer affect Lavaburst. We are also changing the proc rate to a proc per minute mechanic instead of a chance on hit.<br>
<br>
To compensate for lost damage, we are raising Flurry back up to 30% max haste and raising Dual Wield back up to 6% hit.<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t expect this news to be popular based on previous receptions to my posts here, but I remain an eternal optimist that you&apos;ll eventually come to realize that we are trying to get all of the classes balanced. Please try to keep that in mind.<br>
<br>
And for all the intelligent, articulate suggestions and feedback, we do thank you. <br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/paladin.jpg Paladin - Upcoming Divine Plea change<br>
We are still showing good healing from Holy paladins. However, we are getting feedback that they may be struggling with mana and perhaps even with boredom. To help with both of these potential problems, We are going to change Divine Plea to only reduce your healing by 20% (up from 100%). However, the original nerf to the spell was partially because of it being difficult to stop a paladin in PvP, so we are going to make the effect dispellable.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re still taking a look at some of Holy&apos;s deep talents and I do want to acknowledge that there have been many great suggestions to change some of those.<br>
<br>
We understand that some Holy paladins still feel that their movement and group healing mechanics aren&apos;t sufficient yet. However, we still like Bacon of Light , Holy Shock and talents like Infusion of Light to help with these problems. We want to get a few of the kinks out and see them in action more before making further changes here.<br>
<br>
We also want to reiterate that measuring healing is much tougher than estimating dps or tank mitigation. While healing throughput and efficiency are important, so is knowing who to heal when and with what spell. We&apos;re going to keep a close eye on this through the rest of beta, in the Burning Crusade patch and when Lich King goes live. <br>

Brewfest - Brew of the Month<br>
Congratulations on becoming a member of the Brew of the Month club. Yesterday was the last day of September. Binary Brew was the featured item for that month.<br>
<br>
Today is the first of October. Autumnal Acorn Ale is the featured brew this month. This is intended functionality. Hence the whole &quot;Brew of the Month&quot; thing. <br>
<br>
The reasons behind the Downranking nerf<br>
Downranking wasn&apos;t intended in the sense that we never sat down on day one and thought that would be a cool mechanic. It was just something that emerged. We realized some people enjoyed the challenge of figuring out which spell to cast when, so we generally supported it. But late in BC we realized that mana was just a non-issue anymore. With Shadow Priests and pots and mana oil, nobody was running out of mana anymore. As we tried to move mana management back into the game, we saw players just respond by using lower and lower ranks of heals. We were spending an inordinate amount of design time coming up with the perfect cofficients to make downranking possible but not overpowering, and we finally figured we could better spend that time on something else.

Frost Tree vs Unholy/Blood DPS<br>
In our most recent tests, Frost&apos;s dps is still below Blood and Unholy. Icy Touch should make up some of those differences, but it will probably require more. We suspect Blood and Unholy just get a lot of bonus damage from talents like Bloody Vengeance and Ebon Plaguebringer that Frost can&apos;t quite yet match. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10697500131-icy-touch-does-an-insane-amount-of-dmg-now-o.html))<br>
<br>
Icy Touch very high damage<br>
We think what we might end up doing is shifting some of that damage from Icy Touch to Obliterate and Howling Blast. We got Frost&apos;s dps up a lot, which is good. It&apos;s also cool to see Icy Touch feel like a nuke again. We just want to back off of it a little and buff the double rune abilities. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10697500131-icy-touch-does-an-insane-amount-of-dmg-now-o.html))<br>
<br>
Heart Strike low damage<br>
It&apos;s still a bug. Sorry we haven&apos;t fixed it yet. The design intent hasn&apos;t changed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10532599748-heart-strike-forgotten-curious-.html))<br>
<br>
Rune Strike<br>
We felt like we had to implement an ability like Rune Strike, or death knights would never be able to tank bosses. Their dps was very high from the back of a mob and very low from the front. That&apos;s just not going to work. The three other tanking classes did very good dps and threat from the front of the mob.<br>
<br>
The problem is almost certainly that A) DKs suffer a lot from missing key attacks in their rotation. I have compared it a little to a rogue tank who keeps missing his finishing moves or can&apos;t get enough combo points, and B) DKs do not have a rage mechanic, or the mana return that Protadins get, and can&apos;t spam an ability to burn off excess resources. A warrior can miss a Shield Slam but then turn around and queue up Heroic Strikes all day to make up for it.<br>
<br>
Not having rage is a nice benefit for the death knight -- they can do awesome dps without having to be hit on. But in this sense it&apos;s a liability as well.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re not too worried about dps DKs in dps gear dodging or parrying much in PvP. Tank DKs probably will and should, but the damage return will help offset their lower overall dps. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10529929285-gc-new-rune-strike-vs-revenge-and-overpower.html))<br>

Upcoming Feral nerf<br>
However, we are probably going to have to nerf bears. If we don&apos;t, they will be the only MT choice for serious guilds. At the moment, bears in decent gear take less damage, have more health and generate more threat than the other 3 classes by a wide enough margin that we think it&apos;s a problem. This is even true on bosses that do a lot of magic damage (like Malygos).<br>
<br>
I use the word &quot;nerf&quot; because players use it, and I don&apos;t want to hind behind euphamisms. But changing the numbers doesn&apos;t have to mean nerfing you into the ground. We just don&apos;t want you to dominate. I&apos;m sure you&apos;d feel the same way if Protection paladins were just head and shoulders above the other tanks.<br>
<br>
We understand that some Ferals felt they were nerfed in BC either prematurely or in such a way that kept them steadily behind other tanks. (Though Sunwell Radiance was largely for bears.) We will try to make intelligent changes so that you&apos;re still out there tanking the Lich King himself. We want you to be about as good as warriors, paladins and death knights, not way above or below them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/10539069879-on-the-protector-of-the-pack-nerf.html))<br>

Answers to a few recent questions<br>
These seemed to crop up in several different threads, so rather than contaminating those, I thought I would start a new one.<br>
Polar Bear Cub -- This wasn&apos;t intended to be a tamable pet, and it looked ridiculous.<br>
Black Arrow -- This was an ability we were experimenting with. It isn&apos;t actually in the plan for hunters at this point in time. Usually we hide internal abilities better, but we&apos;re trying to get beta builds out quickly and this one slipped through the cracks.<br>
Freezing Trap -- The intent was that this trap break on a flat damage amount. However, we found that pets did not respect traps set up that way as CC and would happily break them. When and if we get the pet AI fixed, we&apos;ll revert it to the less fragile form of the trap.<br>
Lock and Load -- The design we settled on is 2/4/6, making it better than Nightfall (for comparison). If it&apos;s too low, we&apos;ll adjust it.<br>
Aimed Shot -- The intention is that it is better than Multi-Shot against a single target, and that the two share a cooldown so that hunter shot rotations don&apos;t get back into crazy land too quickly again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10539070163-answers-to-a-few-recent-questions.html))<br>
<br>
Aimed shot<br>
It should not reset your auto shot and should have the same cooldown as Multi Shot. It apparently isn&apos;t doing that on your version of the beta build. It will next build. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10539070163-answers-to-a-few-recent-questions.html))<br>
<br>
Growl - New rank added to the game<br>
We recently added a new rank of Growl. Once we have the final numbers in for it, that should help with threat a great deal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/9679804544-hunter-pet-talent-feedback.html))<br>
<br>
Pet leveling changes<br>
We just recently increased the pet level rate. Pets needed 1/16th of hunter experience to gain a level, but don&apos;t benefit from quests or rest. Those two account for a lot of experience, especially at higher levels (where quest content tends to be denser).<br>
<br>
We changed the experience needed for 1/10th. You should notice a big jump in pet level rates. I am not sure if that change got in the most recent data push. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10638057916-please-blue--feedback-on-pet-lvling-system.html))<br>

Improved Inner Fire<br>
We liked the idea of moving Imp Inner Fire. There seemed to be a lot of disagreement about whether Imp PW:Shield or Imp Fort should move down to take its place. We talked about it some, and we&apos;re cool with moving Fort up and Shield down. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/10043279595-suggestion--move-imp-inner-fire.html))<br>

Sap<br>
We discussed letting sap get refreshed a lot. We did fear some problems with PvP so we decided to try expanding the number of targets on which it can be used first. If that doesn&apos;t make rogues good enough at CC, we&apos;ll consider other buffs to sap. <br>

Totem changes<br>
All totems with a duration of 2 minutes will be changing to 5 minutes instead. We&apos;ve got no further changes for totems planned at the moment. Any changes already made to totems in the expansion and pre-patch notwithstanding. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/5963297619-revisit-totems-plz.html))<br>
<br>
Spirit Wolves<br>
The last numbers I saw, the wolves did fairly nice dps. They do scale their strength, stamina and resistance from yours and inherit your hit. We can make sure nothing broke though.<br>
<br>
They are intended to be burst damage, like the elementals. The root breaking is useful and the healing is a little bonus. The taunt will probably always be pretty situational, but the idea was you might be able to save the day sometimes if adds are running amuck. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/10532281338-more-enhancement-changes.html))<br>
<br>
Enhancement<br>
We&apos;re still not happy with how pushed Enhancement feels towards caster gear and feeling like a caster in general. We want to keep the spell damage in there, but it will probably end up being less to push Enhance back towards melee. This might let us undo some of the recent nerfs to physical damage, but no promises until we get things to a state that we like.

Chaos Bolt damage type change<br>
We took a step back and became concerned that we were in a vicious cycle of immunity. Next patch, we&apos;d probably add a &quot;No, this spell REALLY grants immunity,&quot; followed by &quot;Improved Chaos Bolt&quot; which &quot;can even break that new kind of immunity,&quot; and so on. We have resistance for a reason. That said, we had destro locks in Naxx able to do very high damage focusing most on Chaos Bolt.

<br>
Pet Scaling<br>
While some scaling has been great, are there any intentions of resilience/armor/avoidance (some still die easy)? A pet, especially in Demonology, should live past 2-3 hits.<br>
As you know, we have been very reluctant to give resilience to pets. We don&apos;t want to see players dying before they can even kill the pet, let alone the master. We try to provide the warlock and hunter with tools to keep the pets alive. But this is something we&apos;re watching closely, and I&apos;m not sure we&apos;ve seen enough PvP yet to really know how pets are going to stack up. We did recently buff pet health yet again, and we are going to let them inherit the spell pen of the master (they already inherit the hit rating).

Arms and Fury DPS<br>
Last I checked, Arms and Fury were a little low, but getting closer. We found a bug in Deep Wounds (not sure if you guys have it or not) that wasn&apos;t doing Arms any favors. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/10539071179-tg-is-a-dps-upgrade.html))<br>
<br>
Fury issues<br>
Whether or not Fury dps is up to snuff is an issue, but it&apos;s also a different issue. Our numbers do suggest they are getting a lot closer.<br>
Fury&apos;s viability in PVP or lack thereof is also an issue, but I was trying not to turn yet another thread into an All Things Fury thread.<br>
<br>
Titan&apos;s Grip<br>
As plenty of people have pointed out, all I was trying to do was put an end to the myth that getting Titan&apos;s Grip was a dps loss. (Or even show us that it is in fact a dps loss.) I kept reading that in this forum, which made it hard to advance the conversation much beyond that point.<br>
<br>
Whether it&apos;s enough of a dps gain, whether the penalty is the right one, or whether it&apos;s a fun talent are all valid issues. However, since every thread on the topic tends to go in many different directions and wander far off topic, I was trying to start with the basics.
