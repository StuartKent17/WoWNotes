Paragon Finished Raiding<br>
Paragon has decided that they are done raiding. You can find the full article and list of kills on their site. Congratulations to them for many years of World First kills!<br>

We have decided to stop raiding which obviously means we will not be a part of the world first race in Legion. In the end it came between going international, playing with suboptimal Finnish roster or quitting. For a while I was seriously considering going the international route, but in the end decided it was not worth the trouble for me. This question has been looming over our heads for a long time as it has always been a challenge to get a solid Finnish 20-25man roster together and this time there was no 10man option to bail us out.<br>
<br>
Going forward I have no idea if we will be playing WoW in any capacity in the future, we will have to see what is the situation when Legion launches. In the meantime you might see some of us in the fields of Overwatch.<br>
<br>
I would like to thank everyone who played in progress raids with us and made this all possible.<br>

Legion - Soft Foam Sword<br>
A recent Legion build added the Soft Foam Sword (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/137663-soft-foam-sword). It currently kills most mobs rather than reducing their health, but it does appear to work on critters. The current max level for creatures you can use it on is 20 levels below your character level, meaning it will work for Mists of Pandaria and older content once you are Level 110 in Legion. <br>

Legion - Water Striders<br>
Thanks for the feedback, and I apologize for alarm caused by a seemingly random change. What you see in our weekly Alpha builds is a snapshot of thinking that is often actively evolving, including experiments that we&#x2019;re about to discard, or solutions to problems that are overly crude just because it&#x2019;s our first iteration and we simply haven&#x2019;t come up with anything better yet. <br>
<br>
I&#x2019;d like to shed some light on our thought process in exploring this change. No, we&#x2019;re not trying to stamp out fun, or destroy the value of hard-won rewards arbitrarily. The concern that drives this process is that mounts are primarily cosmetic choices, and are one of the most visible ways of showing off an aesthetic you enjoy, or an achievement of which you are proud. But water-walking makes Water Striders mechanically superior to other ground mounts in a way that risks removing a feeling of choice. Even if you want to show off that Invincible that you finally managed to farm up, or your Grove Warden, you may end up feeling foolish for using anything other than the Water Strider in areas where you can&#x2019;t fly, just because it offers that mechanical advantage. <br>
<br>
Our initial change was aimed at letting people feel more free to choose the mount that they felt looked coolest, whether in new content or while leveling alts. But as we&#x2019;ve clearly heard from your feedback, removing the water-walking functionality from pre-existing content feels like we&#x2019;re taking away something that you have worked hard to earn, and that cost outweighs any benefit from potentially broadened cosmetic options. <br>
<br>
So, in the next Alpha build, we&#x2019;re restoring the ability of Water Striders to walk on water in all pre-Legion content (Azeroth, Outland, Northrend, etc.). The restriction on the mounts&#x2019; water-walking ability will now only apply to the Broken Isles and future content beyond that.<br>

Legion<br>
is there any point at all in the EU alpha forums? just let us in the US instead?<br>
Yes, absolutely. We read it all. Just easier to respond on US forums. Assume you&apos;ll see responses, regardless of where they are? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/700136774337634304))<br>

Lore<br>
Then we have other Blizzard employees denying that Fel would be a form of life magic, like Matt.<br>
So now I&apos;m just wondering if Sean Copeland lied to me and others.<br>
I think I just wasn&apos;t clear tbh Nature spells use life energy, fel spells burn/consume life energy/souls, ya? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/700445532343259138))<br>
that&apos;s more of a semantic discussion than a lie, if something burns life, is it &quot;life magic?&quot; IDK &quot;life magic&quot; isnt (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/700446276999995392))<br>
really all that well-defined, not sure it&apos;s been mentioned in-game, outside of maybe chi? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/700446473771573248))<br>
bottom line is: no one is telling you lies, there isn&apos;t a conspiracy or anything, it seems to be mostly word choice (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/700446728806203393))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
If I may ask, what do you think makes MOBAs such a popular genre for e-sports?<br>
Easy to understand the action. Good stories both on and off the field. You can be a fan at lots of different levels of intensity. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700034567147646976))<br>
By the latter I mean you can see your favorite champ get played or get into nuance of individual player preferences and history. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700034786283298816))<br>
