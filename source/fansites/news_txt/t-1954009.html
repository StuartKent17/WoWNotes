Legion - Dalaran Updates<br>
Citizens of Dalaran! Raise your eyes to the skies and observe! Recent Legion builds have made a few small updates to Dalaran. Rhonin got a statue, Rogues got another exist from their class hall into the Blacksmith building, and you can now run across a Treasure Demon in town.<br>

Legion Wardrobe System<br>
If you have Tier 3 pieces (either from Classic WoW or the Black Market Auction House) then these appearances will be unlocked account-wide within the current transmogrification restrictions.<br>
<br>
As an example, let&apos;s say that you&apos;re playing a Warlock:<br>
<br>
If you have a piece of the Frostfire Regalia (Mage) set, then this appearance will be unlocked account-wide for all classes that use Cloth as their primary armor type. If you have a piece of the Dreadnaught (Warrior) set, it won&apos;t be unlocked account-wide as a Warlock can&apos;t equip Plate items.<br>
<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t see why this would work differently for something else than tier 3, so here&apos;s my view : If my mage has mage Tier 2 items, then the mage-tier-2 look is unlocked for all clothies ?<br>
<br>
I strongly disagree with that, sorry, because there are no lookalikes and so far, only mages can have this transmog. Same for paladins, rogues, and many tier sets that remain exclusive to one class ( and other classes only have recolors).<br>
<br>
Other example, which is not different than the tier sets : if my warlock has unlocked MoP challenge mode armor, then this look is available to all clothies ? No thanks.<br>
<br>
The problem is different when there are non-class-set-lookalikes, but I still would prefer that strict rules be enforced : whatever the source of unlocking, you have to be able to use the look yourself to transmog.<br>
<br>
Blizzard, please, please, please put careful thinking on all the unlock / transmog rules, and give us a clear answer of what is or is not possible.<br>
Just to clarify that this does indeed only apply to Tier 3 pieces, because these pieces do not have class-restrictions on them. Other Tier sets will be subject to their normal class restrictions.<br>
<br>
You&apos;re here again. Can you please clarify (since your last post is open to interpretations): Can PLATE USERS unlock CLOTH/LEATHER/MAIL tier 3 items?<br>
No. Only appearances of the primary armor type for that class (Plate) can be unlocked.<br>
<br>
The general rule of thumb for unlocking appearances is:<br>
<br>
<br>
You must be able to equip the armor It must be of your primary armor type It must be able to be obtained and equipped by your class<br>

Legion Class Updates<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#JAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#I))<br>
Retribution Paladin 2/18 update<br>
The class should be designed in a way that regardless of what talent I take I should never be standing around auto attacking waiting for abilities to come off cooldown. The main different between live and legion alpha is that on live, even with the most simple talent options we basically never have to wait for things to come off cooldown 99% of the time and we can generate holy power pretty quickly thanks to the shorter cooldowns on judgement/crusader strike and random procs with exorcism/hammer of wrath.<br>
The above is a philosophical statement we don&apos;t necessarily agree with. There are people that enjoy a slower pace of combat (one that isn&apos;t gcd locked), and the class design has to service their preferences too.<br>
<br>
There&apos;s a fairly common tendency for some players to believe that all talents should be designed to service their play style (active versus passive, gcd locked versus not, solo questing versus raiding versus pvp, etc) such that they have three choices on all rows that they consider compelling alternatives, when in reality it&apos;s more about choosing a set of talents that fits your particular style and therefore defines your character (or at least the way you play it in any given situation).

[Feedback] Retribution Paladins<br>
- I actually don&apos;t mind Ret&apos;s abysmal gap-closing relative to other classes so long as the devs realize just how big a tradeoff this is. For example, if demon hunter is a mobility specialist then by rights our utility should blow theirs out of the water.<br>
We too believe this is key. Mobility will be a weakness for the paladin (and death knight), but it has to be offset adequately in other ways (utility, survivability, dps throughput while on target, etc).

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
I think my biggest prob with homogenization was the loss of fun spriest utility I miss being a mana battery/when mana matterd<br>
Yeah some spriests liked that role and some hated it. Not sure how to solve. Opting into talents to determine playstyle maybe? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/699667850663845888))<br>
<br>
Do you think Warlord of Draenor was a &quot;failure&quot;? Could Legion bring back those who left the game due to the &quot;mistakes&quot; inWod<br>
I didn&apos;t play it so I can&apos;t answer as a player and it would be unprofessional of me to do so anyway. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/699677305321357317))<br>
I will say I worked a lot on MoP and players had a lot of criticisms then too, some totally fair, some less so. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/699678400521211904))<br>
<br>
Which wow raids did you work on? I have some questions.<br>
Sunwell to Siege. I never made bosses myself though. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/699726094572744705))<br>
<br>
What are your thoughts on Ulduar? Beautiful raid, but gigantic to move through. ToC opposite views.<br>
Ulduar was a high-water mark in many ways. Participation was low and the &quot;button&quot; hard modes weren&apos;t sustainable long term. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/699726343815061504))<br>
I always remember it fondly as a player and developer though. It was a beautiful raid and I mean that more than just art. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/699726456008499200))<br>
