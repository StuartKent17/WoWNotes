Warlords of Draenor - Mount Journal UI
Speaking of new mounts, Warlords of Draenor has added some nice upgrades to the mount UI:


The journal now lists a source and description for mounts.
You are now able to set mounts as favorites, putting them at the top of the list.
There is a new Summon Random Favorite Mount button, which selects a usable mount at random from your favorites.
Mounts that are faction specific now have a different background in the list.

New World of Warcraft Comic - Gul'dan and the Stranger
Blizzard released a new comic today in PDF form.


http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/august/guldanComic.jpg https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/Z5EDRREGHRLM1406310705908.pdf 

The drums of war have begun to sound for Draenor’s orcs, and the power-mad warlock Gul’dan is the latest to play them. Brimming with fel energy, Gul’dan is convinced that his people will gain glory and strength if they only kneel to the demonic Burning Legion. But a hooded stranger has recently arrived in Gul’dan’s camp with a somewhat... contradictory vision.

The stranger has walked in places where terrifying war machines will soon shake the earth. From the smoldering ridges of Gorgrond to the hunting grounds of Nagrand, he watches over the orcish ranks, stoking their dreams of a united Horde: pure http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/characters/garrosh-hellscream, free, and utterly dominant. And he has a message for Gul'dan.

We invite you to read and download https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/Z5EDRREGHRLM1406310705908.pdf the free comic, “Gul’dan and the Stranger https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/Z5EDRREGHRLM1406310705908.pdf,” written by Micky Neilson and illustrated by Alex Horley.

Learn more about Gul’dan’s past and future at Characters of Warcraft: Gul’dan http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/characters/guldan.

Racials
Is there a reason why the undead racial is not scaling and every other race do?
The fact that it's not a % and others are does not mean that it doesn't scale and they do. Its damage does scale with other stats. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494007010904387584
Whereas something like 1% crit could also be read as 130 crit rating, which "doesn't scale" just as much but still really does. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494007156786483201

The troll beast exp racial needs to go, I want stay a troll druid, but will always min/max! Just a pointless racial with endgame
Yes, it's a useless racial at endgame. But so what? It doesn't make trolls any worse at endgame. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494200438590173184

Is there any chance to give Death Grip a 8yrd minimum range like charges, so they can't use it as an interrupt
You won't be able to do it twice in Warlords. Giving up your only gap closer to stop a cast is a reasonable tradeoff holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494239967485259776

also, I know you have heard it a ton of time. Is there ANY hope that our only raid CD, AMZ, can get moved out of talents?
We're still satisfied with AMZ being a talent. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494688680343130112
Raiding is only part of the game, and it's not necessarily ideal in all, or even most raid encounters. It's a viable choice. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494688953492975618

Blood is by far the least engaging tank. I still love them, but it seems like they are being made even more bare bones.
I would definitely disagree with you. Rotational simplicity does not mean shallowness. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494912953947144194
Actually, unless there's some interesting interaction between abilities that's exactly what a simpler rotation means!
But there are more interesting interactions between abilities. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494951597105872897

still no change to fire. Please consider synchronizing Prismatic Crystal better with Fire's only dps CD.
Prismatic Crystal already 2.3x's the value of Combustion, due to spreading it via Inferno Blast. No need. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494362929735536640

Are you OK with the totem talent tier, especially for DPS spec in PvE ? Many Sham say "meg" about this talent row.
It's not a great talent row. We see it as being not actively bad, just pretty "meh", as you say. We'd like to improve or... Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494740284559740928
...replace it at some point, but it's not at the top of our list of priorities at the moment, since it's not causing problems Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494740471810236416
You said the totem tier isnt a great talent row. Isnt it because the whole totem mechanism is a bit old and need a rework ?
A Spamming doesn't help. B Designs aren't bad because they get "old". Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494916649560977411

Why does elemental blast not have a healing component for resto? Its the only dps talent without a healing component.
Granting you increased Spirit is effectively a healing component, by giving you more mana to cast more expensive heals. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494908612339187712
So it's purely a resource building spell with a 2 second cast time?
I don't think that "purely" is an appropriate word for it. It does damage, some of a random stat, and a bunch of spirit. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494916257993326593

You changed the tooltip on Burning rush in Beta; I need some clarification please. Can we absorb this self-afflicted damage?
It's now like any other DoT. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/493986793260208129

PvE
I cant invite someone to a group to share a tag if I'm queued for a dungeon w/o losing q
That's a terrible quality of life issue, and is one we'd like to fix. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/493970384518008833

any chance we can get a guaranteed fresh LFR at least for first one each week? sucks sitting for 2 hour long queues
So then backfilling LFR on the first evening of the week would be literally impossible? WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/494590626252345345
If you've killed the final boss of an LFR wing, you're at least guaranteed a fresh instance if you requeue. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/494590748130414592

I've gotta know. Some kind of anti-pet boss damage mechanism? Staghelm etc. hit my Tenacity pet much harder than they do me.
Many raid bosses are flagged to do triple damage when meleeing player pets. We really don't want pets tanking raid bosses. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/493980648491589633
Can we have that NOT interfere with soloing old content, please?
This has been this way for literally 5 years. It's not some new system. Pet classes can solo just fine despite it. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/494703984423100419

PvP
Will there be timers for bg's built into the UI in WoD?
Unfortunately no. High on the todo list tho. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494506156803366912
There's an add-on called bgtimers out there that might help you. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494596390568198144

Can you gear up playing in Ashran only or will bgs/arenas be required for highest end? ratings?
You can earn conquest in Ashran, but it won't increase your cap. So it's doable, but not the most efficient route. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494601704029966336

Will there be pve incentives to go to ashran as well
It will have some endgame rewards in common with other zones so it will be worthwhile for PvE players too. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494605331159216130

What do you feel is a fair criteria for CC that's bad for the game? Is there a clear line for you?
We should shoot to have counters to everything. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494604236668157955
Prediction-counters or post-hit counters? If former, what's a counter to e.g. Storm Bolt? Instant, ranged, undispellable, free.
WoW PvP is a team game and teammate play has to be considered a counter. In this case, how do you react to Stormbolt. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494614984131747841
And, for some comps, there is no reaction counter either, depending on what the purpose of its use was.
Prevention is one counter. Reaction is another. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494617977136766976

Currently there're 620675 in pvp blues and 660690 in pvp epics in database. Is this going to be the gear system in 6.0?
Yes those are the ilevels for the Veteran Honor gear and Conquest gear respectively. Honor gear is 600 660 in pvp. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494673407238094851

how's tank viability in pvp comin along?
I actually think they have a really fun role in the large Ashran fights. They really push the fight forward. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494601307315916800

Will Garrisons have any PvP integration? Any reason for PvPers to be excited about Garrisons aside from building bonuses?
There will be some PvP elements. More to come. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494946093319192577

Lore
Also, do arrakoa dye their feathers as decoration/sign of rank, or do they prefer jewelry and other such things?
Arrakoa definitely love shiny jewelry. might have answers to your other questions! He's our Arrak-expert. DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/493921247990784000

Related; are the gender difference in arrakoa based in the colors/patterns of their feather coats like RL birds?
Not related to feather color or anything obvious to non-arakkoa. They appear androgynous to other races. _DonAdams https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493922329500459008

Will ingame Thrall be renamed to Go'el anytime soon? Every character in War Crimes calls him like that already.
In-game only very close intimates call him Go'el. Most characters will continue to refer to him as "Thrall." DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/494224975713148928

Please reconsider no dailies; they're something to do beyond dungeon grinding, and give a way to make money besides profs and AH
There are many more things to do in the outdoor world, and more ways to make money. We just found things more fun than blue !s. craig_amai https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/494401601638260736
dailies can tell a story; timeless isle-esque grinding doesnt. Is the world stuff just grinding mobs and having to play AH?
Much more than grinding and AH. Real story quests, guided attacks on enemy bases, many garrison efforts. craig_amai https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/494565912758861824
Dailies do have their place, and they're not gone completely, we're just favoring new fun structures. craig_amai https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/494566325121871873
