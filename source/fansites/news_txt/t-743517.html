Eviscerate<br>
We are changing Improved Eviscerate to also affect Envenom, to give Assassination another attractive first tier talent for the endgame player. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262768257/break-the-dev-silence-rogue-issues/))<br>
<br>
Recuperate<br>
Endgame rogues will not be balanced around 100% uptime for Recuperate. We do think rogues will use it however. If mana matters a little more, then keeping yourself alive a little more will matter. We&apos;re not fans of the (sadly widespread) belief that keeping the group alive is solely the responsibility of the healers and that dps should do everything in their power solely to maximize their dps, even if that makes things harder on the healers. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262768257/break-the-dev-silence-rogue-issues/))<br>
