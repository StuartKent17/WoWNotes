Racials
really disappointing and quite telling that imbalances are left in for the same of something as silly as faction balance
If there were no racials, Humans would still be by far the most popular class on the Alliance. holinka

Snake Trap is really only used for Entrapment anyway
Nope.I use it every fight for the various poisons it does especially the all important slow poison.
Do you really need two different traps to slow enemies? Celestalon 

No scatter shot is not gone.We tried traps activating instantly.Warriors still will charge over them.
Warriors will not charge over traps. Celestalon 
You promise?Because right now Ive seen hundreds of players just cruise right over them.Even in direct los.
They're made with different tech now. Celestalon 

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Since Fire scales much better then all other specs, devs had to nerf it every major patch to get it back in line
It doesn't necessarily have to scale better than other specs. We have one change coming that helps prop it up at early gear levels. Celestalon 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Hoping for an answer. I <3 Arc Torrent on my healadin for the mana return. Still happen in WoD? Or all pally specs getting HP?
All Paladins get Holy Power instead of Mana. Holy Power will be more valuable, though. Celestalon 
No more mana for paladins, inc holy? Very big change! Moving MW to energy also? Or did I read too much into that?
You misread. This is talking about Arcane Torrent, the Blood Elf Racial. Celestalon 
Sir celestalon, will it still do aoe silence or will it just be a resource gain?
Still does that. Celestalon 

Anyway you could talk about design philosophy when approaching Retribution in WoD?
Anything in particular? Generally planning polish and tuning, but no major revision. Happy with Ret design, minus a couple tweaks. Celestalon 

 Rogue Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
rogues are very dependant of crit, any buff for them in wod?
It's folly to ask for buffs when fixating on one specific change without considering all of the other changes coming. holinka 

Is paralytic poison gone, or did it go baseline?
It is gone in Warlords. holinka 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Any plans on taking a look at Windfury Weapon in WoD? lots of us feel it's lost it's wow factor scuse the pun in recent expacs
We're investigating whether we can take the cooldown off it but still not proc off itself. No promises though. Celestalon 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
so will u also make arcane torrent more valuabke to warlocks? Mana useless, need either burning ember soul shard or demonic fury
A whole soul shard is too much, which is a problem. Celestalon 
whats about other specs. Half a burning ember or 100 demonic fury doesnt seem like a problem
Problem is consistency. Celestalon 
but u can see how mana is useless for lock? Love belfs but turn between changing race :-S trolls an orcs look more appealing
BElf still gives 1% Crit, so not useless. Celestalon 

PvE
Also, with valor/justice gone, what's going to be the carrot to get people to complete groups in WoD?
We'll have more info in weeks ahead, but we agree it's important that people are incentivized to not bail mid-run. WatcherDev 

cata healing changes. with all the changes happening with healing, is SoO going to be reduced burst damage output? cont
SoO will be adjusted to suit any class changes. It won't be more difficult in 6.0. WatcherDev 

in 6.0 will SoO go to the new raiding system? Norm and Hero flex specifically
Yes, it will. WatcherDev 

What's the word on Mythic trash? I feel it would add a lot of immersion to the dungeons. Still have nightmares of AQ trash.
No more dynamic difficulty swapping means that raids will have Mythic trash. And yes, that means Mythic trash loot. WatcherDev 

PvP
running dungeons then converting JP to honor is faster than queueing bgs... can u fix that
We did one wave of buffs to honor rate. We may do another based on what we see. holinka 

By 'mean' you mean 'poorly designed,' right?
World PvP is deliberately unstructured & emergent. If you want a fair fight, we have instances holinka 

With the expansion coming on december and the season ending in 20 weeks what are we going to do during this big gap without arenas?
We have made no announcement about when the season will end or when the game will be released. You're making bad assumptions. holinka 
I was just assuming the worst case scenario. Should we expect a 30+ weeks season, like s11?
sorry, we don't comment/speculate on the length of a season. holinka 

How does the team feel about the new arena ladder? I kinda miss teams because I liked starting fresh on a new charter. What's yours
We're quite happy with the change. In general it feels like an improvement. holinka 

World
fail 
I've seen that extremely rarely, and always found that flying away and coming back solved it. Sorry! Celestalon 
We cant fly in warlord's how do we solve issues like this.
A We don't intend to have bugs like that. B I just said 'fly' as that's what's common now. 'Ride' does the same thing. Celestalon
