Boubouille2012-02-18, 08:29 AM<img src="" style="margin-bottom:-2px; margin-right:0px; vertical-align:bottom" /> Diablo 3 - Beta Patch 13  is out and includes an insane amount of changes! Complete revamp of the runes system, public chat, Real Money Auction House updates, and more!

Important - I apparently forgot to mention it, but winners for the Heart of the Aspects have already been picked. If you didn't get a PM from me, you haven't won. Sorry!

Patch 4.3.3 available on Test Realms
We didn't really report earlier because of all the Mists of Pandaria craziness but the Patch 4.3.3 is now available on test realms! This is a bugfix patch and you shouldn't expect any change from it as far as we know, but it means more bugs are being fixed on live realms soon!

Update to Mists Talent Calculator
What are the developments for the Cat and Bear versions of Mangle/Swipe/Thrash/etc.?
Several abilities for Cats and Bears are slightly different depending on Cat or Bear Form. The abilities youâ€™re seeing in the talent calculator are the base versions that show up in your spellbook. Here are some additional details about their different effects in each form:



Mangle: In Cat Form, has no cooldown, costs energy, and generates a combo point. In Bear Form, generates 5 rage, and has a 6 second cooldown, which can also be reset by a proc from Lacerate and now Thrash ticks.
Swipe: In Cat Form, has no cooldown, and costs energy. In Bear Form, has a 3 second cooldown, and is free.
Thrash: In Cat Form, has no cooldown, and costs energy. In Bear Form, has a 6 second cooldown, and costs 15 rage.
Skull Bash: Costs 15 energy or 10 rage, depending on form, and has a 15 second cooldown. The current talent calculator says that it has a 10 second cooldown, but that is a mistake. It is 15 seconds like most other interrupts are now.
Stampeding Roar: Costs 30 energy or 15 rage, depending on form.
Faerie Fire: Has a 6 second cooldown when used in Cat or Bear Form.

This sounds like Combat Maces all over again.
Your feedback is appreciated. We'll be keeping an eye on how this ability pans out, just as we will with all the upcoming changes. That said, I'm not sure that mace stun and Paralytic Poison is an apples to apples comparison.

One of the things that made Mace stun so vicious is that it simply happened. You could make brief contact with an enemy and get a lucky, sometimes clutch, proc. At the time, Stormherald was floating around amongst warriors which only exacerbated the issue. That's important context for the purposes of this comparison. Sure, chance plays a role only in that each stack has a percentage chance to proc but I don't think it's as much of a factor with Paralytic as it was with Mace Stun.

Consider that poisons are dispellable, and you need five stack of Paralytic to get a stun off. It seems reasonably likely that the Paralytic stun will have a different dynamic in PvP than Mace Stun had. If your target is dropping stacks or you aren't able to make consistent enough contact to get stacks on faster than they drop off you may have some trouble getting the stun to land. It will also introduce the dynamic of trying to 'plan' your kidney shots around your Paralytic, so you aren't overlapping stuns.

Also, all of that aside, taking a talent in Mists of Pandara means that you're making trade-offs that you weren't making by taking Mace Spec in Burning Crusade.

On a side-note, I noticed some other, non-poison/shiv related questions in this thread. Please stay on topic guys. I know that it's tempting to jump all over the map I've done it, but it's best to stay focused. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
