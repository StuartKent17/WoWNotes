I just received an update on the Patch 4.3.2, it seems that the update was postponed because of a very bad bug. As far as I know it means the patch won't happen tomorrow, however it might happen on wednesday in the US and thursday in Europe. If it's not the case it will be postponed to next week. 

The info was solid and was backed up by a few other things announcement of PTRs going down, etc but those last minute changes happen, and there's nothing I can do against them. This is also the reason why Blizzard doesn't announce patches early. 

Even if I always warn that things might be postponed, it still sucks when it does happen, and this is pretty much how comfortable I feel when I have to announce it  Feel free to yell at me and make me sad. I'll be in my corner trying to hide in my happy place
