Quests
Some unintentionally hidden World Quests in Suramar have been re-activated, including World Quests that are new to Patch 7.1.
Lingering Soul Fragments for the quest "Soul Prism of the Illidari" should now be guaranteed to drop from Heroic dungeon end bosses.


Karazhan Quests Hotfix
Yesterday, a hotfix to the game corrected an issue where players weren’t receiving credit for killing Viz’aduum on the quests In the Eye of the Beholder and Tower of Power. This introduced a new issue where the quest “Tower of Power” now appears to be incomplete, even after you kill Viz’aduum. Try turning in the quest in your Class Hall after killing Viz’aduum for the week, even if it doesn’t look complete.

We apologize for the confusion.
