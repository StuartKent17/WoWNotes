Legion Developer Interviews<br>
Some other sites interviewed the developers about Demon Hunters and got a few answers that haven&apos;t been covered in other interviews. <br>
<br>

<br>
There are still parts of the Dark Whispers event that players didn&apos;t figure out during the time it was active on beta. <br>
When you turn into a Dreadlord you get 6,666% additional health and raid boss power level abilities. <br>
Vengeance is probably a mid-tier tank when it comes to complexity. They have a lot utility in Mythic+ dungeons which makes them a little more complex, but a little less complex in raid tanking.<br>

<br>
Legion invasion events will scale from Level 10 to 100.<br>
Garrison building tech saved the day and allowed for the invasions to spawn in large buildings and really take over the zones.<br>
The team didn&apos;t spend enough time in Warlords or make use of the assets and story there well. <br>
Legion is going to be a longer expansion with more patches so that the story is told well <br>
The Warlords quests that just required you to fill a bar with no story weren&apos;t great. <br>
The last two expansions together have taught the team where they need to spend their time and effort in terms of evolving WoW.<br>
Not doing Demon Hunters until now means that their mobility and other things that weren&apos;t possible with Burning Crusade tech could be realized well. <br>

Legion - Infernal Mounts<br>
Legion adds infernal mounts as drops from Gul&apos;dan in The Nighthold. The Hellfire Infernal (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/171827-hellfire-infernal) drops in Mythic and Felblaze Infernal (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/213134-felblaze-infernal) in Heroic and Normal. There are three other colors with no assigned sources. <br>
