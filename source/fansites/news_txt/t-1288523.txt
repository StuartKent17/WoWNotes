Patch 5.3 - Battle of Razor Hill
Today we are taking a look at the Battle of Razor Hill and quests leading up to it from the Horde perspective. You begin by traveling to Sen'jin village after completing two of the new scenarios, and speaking with Vol'jin  He sends you in to the Barrens  to collect 15 Lumber, Stone, Oil, and Meat, which requires killing one mob per item, looting crates with the items, or escorting the caravans that travel through the Barrens. While doing so, you will also earn some Lesser Charms from NPC drops. 

After gathering those supplies, you return to Vol'jin in time for the Battle of Sen'jin Village , in which you join Thrall and Chen Stormstout in defending the village  from the Kor'kron attackers. 

After a solid victory in Sen'jin Village, you march onward to Razor Hill with Vol'jin and Chen Stormstout. Upon arriving at Razor Hill, the battle is already underway in the air and on the ground. You defeat some guards, named NPCs, and release captive Razor Hill NPCs from cages before heading to see Vol'jin once again. Once at the small new Sanctuary area outside of Razor Hill, Baine Bloodhoof shows up to speak with Vol'jin about helping the revolution.

Will we ever need our Prismatic Eye or Legendary Gem in 5.4?
Our current thought is the meta gem continues to work in 5.4 helmets. The weapon gem unlikely. Source 

Will there ever be a day where you drop the legendary no transmog thing? Such a dated concept. Let people show off.
Potentially someday. Our goal all along was to start transmog off conservatively. It's very hard to do so later. Source 

When is Blizz going to wake up that bloated loot tables make this worse! more smaller chances has high variance
Keep in mind, our goal is not to gear up players as fast as possible. That may be the players' goal.... Source 
I think people tend to forget when people in their raid group get loot, but they always remember when *their* loot didn't drop
Especially in Raid Finder, where you don't know or don't care if Stabby the rogue got his bracers. Source 

How about a 5 or 10% xp buff for your account each time you reach max level per character? 
Above and beyond heirlooms and guild bonuses? At some point you're going to get a level every quest. Would that make sense? Source 

You've said numerous times in the past you wished to get rid of racials. Are we ever going to see this happen?
I doubt it. It's part of the fantasy of rolling a character. Not sure the non-twitter, non-forum players would understand. Source 

so GC, tell me, how many dailies are planned for 5.3? Any plans in the next xpack to make reps account wide?
I'm not a fan of account-wide rep. Seems one step removed from account-wide gear. Source 
Except that it in no way is close to account wide gear. Still need to grind Valor, etc. Nice deflection though!
Our philosophy has been to ask players to do almost everything on an alt that they do on a main, just faster. Source 
It's all part of the same discussion though. What belongs to the character vs. the account? Source 

If you don't want alts to catch up so easily, why is leveling so fast/easy/boring?
It's a matter of degree. We don't want an alt to take as long as a main, but we do want actual gameplay there. Source
