Patch 5.3 - Battle of Razor Hill
Today we are taking a look at the Battle of Razor Hill and quests leading up to it from the Horde perspective. You begin by traveling to Sen'jin village after completing two of the new scenarios, and speaking with Vol'jin http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32867-voljin-of-the-darkspear. He sends you in to the Barrens http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32819-battlefield-barrens to collect 15 Lumber, Stone, Oil, and Meat, which requires killing one mob per item, looting crates with the items, or escorting the caravans that travel through the Barrens. While doing so, you will also earn some Lesser Charms from NPC drops. 

After gathering those supplies, you return to Vol'jin in time for the Battle of Sen'jin Village http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32813-battle-of-senjin-village, in which you join Thrall and Chen Stormstout in defending the village http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32813-battle-of-senjin-village from the Kor'kron attackers. 

After a solid victory in Sen'jin Village, you march onward to Razor Hill with Vol'jin and Chen Stormstout. Upon arriving at Razor Hill, the battle is already underway in the air and on the ground. You defeat some guards, named NPCs, and release captive Razor Hill NPCs from cages before heading to see Vol'jin once again. Once at the small new Sanctuary area outside of Razor Hill, Baine Bloodhoof shows up to speak with Vol'jin about helping the revolution.

Blue Tweets
Character
Will we ever need our Prismatic Eye or Legendary Gem in 5.4?
Our current thought is the meta gem continues to work in 5.4 helmets. The weapon gem unlikely. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323143939223859200

Will there ever be a day where you drop the legendary no transmog thing? Such a dated concept. Let people show off.
Potentially someday. Our goal all along was to start transmog off conservatively. It's very hard to do so later. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318898244929335297

When is Blizz going to wake up that bloated loot tables make this worse! more smaller chances has high variance
Keep in mind, our goal is not to gear up players as fast as possible. That may be the players' goal.... Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321704031653343232
I think people tend to forget when people in their raid group get loot, but they always remember when *their* loot didn't drop
Especially in Raid Finder, where you don't know or don't care if Stabby the rogue got his bracers. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322439779323084800

How about a 5 or 10% xp buff for your account each time you reach max level per character? 
Above and beyond heirlooms and guild bonuses? At some point you're going to get a level every quest. Would that make sense? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322391120124452866

You've said numerous times in the past you wished to get rid of racials. Are we ever going to see this happen?
I doubt it. It's part of the fantasy of rolling a character. Not sure the non-twitter, non-forum players would understand. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322080632933068801

so GC, tell me, how many dailies are planned for 5.3? Any plans in the next xpack to make reps account wide?
I'm not a fan of account-wide rep. Seems one step removed from account-wide gear. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321306743084834817
Except that it in no way is close to account wide gear. Still need to grind Valor, etc. Nice deflection though!
Our philosophy has been to ask players to do almost everything on an alt that they do on a main, just faster. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321435267103866880
It's all part of the same discussion though. What belongs to the character vs. the account? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321435081388462083

If you don't want alts to catch up so easily, why is leveling so fast/easy/boring?
It's a matter of degree. We don't want an alt to take as long as a main, but we do want actual gameplay there. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321321079241052161
