Class Design on the 7.1.5 PTR<br>
We&#x2019;re making some significant changes to many specializations in Patch 7.1.5, and this has understandably resulted in some concern and confusion, particularly from players who may be less familiar with our PTR and development processes. So, we&#x2019;d like to take a moment to explain what&#x2019;s going on and how it pertains to what you&#x2019;re seeing (or haven&#x2019;t yet seen) on the PTR.<br>
<br>
First, it&#x2019;s important to understand the role that the PTR plays in our overall development process. At this stage, Patch 7.1.5 is still a work in progress. The PTR is only a snapshot of where we happened to be in development at the time the build was created. There are a lot of people working on WoW, and a lot of projects in various stages of completion. As a result, especially at this early stage of the PTR cycle, you&#x2019;re going to see a lot of incomplete or unfinished work. Quite often, when something you see doesn&#x2019;t make sense, it&#x2019;s simply because we hadn&#x2019;t finished making it make sense before the latest build was created.<br>
<br>
Looking specifically at class design, the changes you&#x2019;re seeing so far are focused primarily on how each spec plays in terms of mechanics, rotations, ability sets, talent options, etc. As some of these changes are fairly significant, we haven&#x2019;t been making many adjustments to overall performance just yet. We need each spec to be completely functional before we can start tuning its effectiveness.<br>
<br>
Right now, the build currently live on the 7.1.5 PTR is only about halfway through those mechanical changes. We&#x2019;ve been continuing to work hard on getting those finished, and the next build should give you a clearer picture of what&#x2019;s happening with your spec. We&#x2019;ll try to share as much insight as we can into what we&#x2019;re doing at that point.<br>

Artifact Power Exploit Actions<br>
Players that exploited the world quests to gain excessive Artifact Power will lose that Artifact Power.<br>

Patch 7.1.5 PTR - Artifact Knowledge Catch Up<br>
Patch 7.1.5 allows you to complete Knowledge is Power (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/46147-knowledge-is-power) to convert 500 x Order Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources) into Artifact Research Synopsis (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/144395-artifact-research-synopsis).<br>
In the upcoming Patch 7.1.5 (currently on the PTR for testing), you will be able to purchase ranks of Artifact Knowledge instantly for Order Resources up until a certain rank, at which point you&apos;ll have to continue with researching Artifact Knowledge as normal.<br>
<br>
As things currently are, if you&apos;re only just starting out at 110 right now, the amount of time needed to research the lower ranks of Artifact Knowledge is already a lot shorter than the 5 days needed to research ranks at the opposite end of the spectrum.<br>

Legendary Item Luck<br>
Hey all,<br>
<br>
I&apos;d just like to clear up a common misconception I&apos;ve seen come up a lot in of recent discussions regarding Legendaries.<br>
<br>
In short:<br>
<br>
Your total time /played and average item level has no bearing on your chances of obtaining a Legendary.<br>
<br>
To be a little more specific:<br>
<br>
Player A and Player B could both have exactly 10 days of /played at level 110 and neither of them have a Legendary yet.<br>
<br>
Player A has spent most of that time idling in Dalaran or their Order Hall, simply kicking it by the water cooler in guild chat or trade chat. Beyond doing their daily Emissary Cache and a Mythic Dungeon here or there, they don&apos;t really do that much in the way of Legendary-eligible content. Now, Player A could get very lucky with their next Emissary Cache and get a Legendary, but they&apos;d be a statistical outlier in this scenario.<br>
<br>
Player B, on the other hand, has spent the majority of their time doing Legendary-eligible content. They do their daily Emissary Cache, clear Emerald Nightmare each week, do a Random Legion Heroic Dungeon regularly and participate in a lot of Mythic/Mythic Keystone dungeon runs to help out their friends etc.<br>
<br>
At this point in time Player B&apos;s chance of getting a Legendary will be much higher than that of Player A. As Player B has participated in far more Legendary-eligible content, their bad luck protection will be ramping up and increasing their chances of a getting a Legendary from their next run of Legendary-eligible content. Hence the saying &quot;if you do the content, the Legendaries will come.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then player A gets BiS legendaries, while Player B gets the !@#$ tier legendaries that are totally useless. Fast forward some time, Player A and Player B both try to get the same spot in a raid. Of course, player A gets picked because he has better legendaries that actually increase his performance.<br>
Well in this scenario as Player B has been helping their guild out more than Player A has, I think most communal focused guilds would prefer to give the spot to someone like Player B who is actually contributing to helping the guild, rather than the person who got lucky and is simply there for the ride.<br>
<br>
Also as Player B has spent more time doing current content than Player A, they will arguably know how to adapt and adjust to situations (like where they can squeeze out more DPS for example) more readily than Player A will.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of groups and guilds clearing Normal and Heroic Emerald Nightmare &amp; Trial of Valor with most of their roster not even having a BiS Legendary. A Legendary should not going to be the sole determining factor in whether or not a coordinated group is going to beat an encounter. Sure, the Legendary might bring enhancements or utility that may make the process smoother, but they&apos;re not a through-and-through substitute for skill and execution.<br>
<br>
Only, many of us are doing the content but still aren&apos;t getting any or just getting bad once that we&apos;ll never use.<br>
<br>
The system is still the worst idea you ever had and it&apos;s completely ruining the experience the game is supposed to deliver. It&apos;s no longer fun! Playing the game is NOT fun. Do you not see this?<br>
<br>
The legendary system at it&apos;s best provides a sense of relief if you manage to get two good ones but at it&apos;s worst it just makes you furstrated, angryand disapointed.<br>
<br>
That is NOT a good system. Let us target the items that are quickly becoming mandatory (if they aren&apos;t already) like you said would be possible.<br>
<br>
That small change would make the expantion way better in every way. As it stands now, Legion is by far the worst expantion to date simply becuase of this legendary system.<br>
<br>
How do you not see this Blizzard? Why aren&apos;t you listening to feedback?<br>
We are listening to, and reading, the feedback and we&apos;re regularly forwarding the feedback on. If/when I receive any thoughts or information I can share in regards to feedback received, then I will share it with you as I always have. Not having an answer does not mean you are not being listened too.
