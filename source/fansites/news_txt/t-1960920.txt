Legion - Tier 3 BMAH Gear Transmog Restrictions
The developers answered one of the questions about transmogging BMAH gear again  today.
Tier 3 pieces obtained via the BMAH will have their appearances unlocked account-wide within current transmogrification restrictions. The Frostfire Regalia www.wowdb.com/item-sets/526-frostfire-regalia set can be transmogged on a Warlock, for example. WarcraftDevs

Secondary Stat Scaling in Legion
The thing I realized then is, that a single-stat item has as much stats as an evenly distributed item on the same ilvl, and even more than an unevenly distributed item.
This was originally done to encourage players to diversify secondary stats -- the closer an item was to a single-stat secondary, the more it suffered from this penalty. We reevaluated the method we were doing this by in 6.2, finding that most people were just confused by it and it didn't affect balance in any significant way, so we changed it. Your secondary stat ratings should add up to a consistent value no matter what the combination is from here on out. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Ability Damage in PvP
We've discovered a bug where weapon damage is being calculated incorrectly in our PvP stat templates. A lot of damage is overtuned as a result. We're working on fix it as soon as possible. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Ashran in Legion
Level 110 players will be able to queue for Ashran from the UI in Legion. It will work similar to battlegrounds, you can queue with up to 5 players. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

[Request] Equal Gear for Factions/Vendor
Can we get a vendor or something so we can have equal gear regaurdless of which faction we choose?

It's kind of weird how Horde and Alliance Shadow Priests have different gear. Alliance gets the RPPM caster DPS trinket, while horde gets the on-use versatility caster trinket. Not to mention for whatever reason, I have 2% more crit on Horde, but 5% more haste on Alliance before BG scaling.
Are there any other cases of this or just Shadow Priests? Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Greatly reduced skill plays?
At least for warrior, there seems to be nothing. No spell reflects, no fear, no intervene. It seems like all of our pvp talents are just "more ways to deal damage" with maybe 2 or 3 exceptions. When I look through other dps classes it seems mostly the same. Most every class has become a gigantic damage bot with little else to offer. Especially from a tournament standpoint it seems like a very *boring* route to take. I dunno. Maybe I'm wrong.
There are some specializations we agree may feel "flat" with lack of utility tools right now on alpha. It would be useful for us to hear which specializations testers feel are in a bad/good/too good spot in that regard with reasons why. 

While the gameplay of specializations without PvP talents is important, it's most useful to us to hear feedback with full PvP talents. Some specs may feel flat baseline, but with talents feel like they're in a good/too good spot. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Demon Hunters and Flag Carrying
Demon Hunters are able to zoom across the map before it even has time to appear on the mini map. Timed it and it was 23 seconds from point of pick up to capture. Is it worth stunting their mobility like several other abilities while carrying the flag? It isn't fun when the flag is picked up and then captured before you really have time to react.
Agreed. We're making changes very soon. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Note that AoE damage spells don't by default fall off after 6 targets; that's only healing spells. For damage it's a much higher number of targets.

Correct though, the bulk of the value of Divine Star and Halo is still in the direct healing effect. Their gameplay is still meant to be focused on their use as healing spells when it comes to aiming/positioning. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

Do we have everything available to us atm? I miss a few of the "combat" spec had. As far as lvling goes and using Roll the Bones, its fun in the world, but i can see where it will be a hinder in a raid environment, to busy seeing what buff you got miss an interrupt, stand in some poo, ect.
The intention is not for you to keep fishing for the lucky 5-buff Roll the Bones. If you have theorycraft indicating that it's optimal to keep using Roll the Bones, when you already have a buff apart from the Health one, we'd love to review that. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

I havent seen anyone talk about this but it seems that the dreadstalker imps are hitting significantly harder then imps summoned from impending doom and hand of guldan. Also they are not scaling with the infernal furnace tallent. 
The Dreadstalker riders should 100% count the same as, and deal the same damage as, regular wild imps. There are just likely some bugs with that. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums
