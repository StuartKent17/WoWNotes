A few additional changes from the 3.0.8 PTRs<br>
<br>
Reputation<br>
You can now get full reputation gains from grey monsters, for exemple you will get 20 Reputation points for killing normal monsters while grinding your Timbermaw Hold (http://www.wowwiki.com/Timbermaw_Hold_reputation_guide) reputation.<br>
<br>
Item changes<br>
I think I newsed a few of them in previous news, but most of them should be new. <br>
All the items sold by the Argent Quartermaster (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=16786) during the latest Scourge Invasion aren&apos;t disenchantable anymore.<br>
Reins of the Traveler&apos;s Tundra Mammoth (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44235) can no longer be sold back to the NPCs for 5000 gold. <br>
Titansteel Helms now all have a blue and a meta gem socket. Some of them also got their stats changed/reduced. (Spiked Titansteel Helm (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/december/spikedtitansteelhelm.jpg), Tempered Titansteel Helm (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/december/temperedtitansteelhelm.jpg), Brilliant Titansteel Helm (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/december/brillianttitansteelhelm.jpg)). As a reminder the spell power on Titansteel Guardian (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=41384) has been reduced from 490 to 457.<br>
Darkmoon Card: Death (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=42990) now gives critical strike rating instead of haste.<br>
Savage (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/december/newdkpvpbonus.jpg) / Hateful (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/december/newdkpvpbonus.jpg) / Deadly Gladiator&apos;s Dreadplate Gauntlets (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/december/newdkpvpbonus.jpg) had their bonus to Strangulate cooldown removed. They now gives &quot;Whenever you cast Chains of Ice, the Frost Rune used becomes a Death Rune when it activates&quot;. <br>
Je&apos;Tze&apos;s Bell (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=37835) is now Bind When Equipped.<br>
All the Off-hand items crafted through Inscription (http://www.wowhead.com/?items&amp;filter=sl=23;cr=86;crs=15;crv=0#0-2+1) had their Inscription level requirement removed.

Dragon&apos;s Eye (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=42225) and epic gems like Bold Dragon&apos;s Eye (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=42142) now only requires 350 Jewelcrafting. Down from 375. (Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/december/dragonseyes.jpg))<br>

Tanking as frost<br>
We adjusted Frost Presence to make up for the nerfs to Icebound Fortitude, Bone Shield and the change to bonus armor from jewelry etc. (Most raiding DK tanks were Unholy at the time, though they have begun to branch out a little.)<br>
<br>
Both of those abilities are intended to be more like Shield Block or Last Stand, not something that is up all the time like Frost Presence itself. In most of the estimates I have seen that figure this is a huge nerf use pretty unrealistic estimates of how much Bone Shield is up (thinking their avoidance can make up for the charges). But we can check out numbers again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/13832573744-gcs-take-on-bone-shield.html))<br>
<br>
Cooldown removed on Howling Blast in the latest PTR patch<br>
It is an intended change. We&apos;re going to try it without a cooldown. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13832774332-howling-blast-and-the-ptr-gc-please.html))<br>

Allow Wild Growth to count towards Nourish bonus<br>
Yeah, there is a good chance we&apos;ll do this. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13833025312-gc-allow-wg-to-count-towards-nourish-bonus.html))<br>

Better scaling on hunter&apos;s pets to compensate the recent nerfs?<br>
That scaling idea is interesting. We&apos;ll talk about it some more. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13723762657-hunter-pet-nerf-scaling-and-ap-buffs.html))<br>
