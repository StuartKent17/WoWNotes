Patch 5.2 - Isle of Thunder Rare Spawns<br>
We already talked about (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3081-New-5-2-Rare-Spawns-5-1-Hotfixes-5-2-Set-Bonus-Issues-5-2-Raid-Testing-Blue-Posts) the new rare spawns that drop some of the Direhorn mounts, so let&apos;s take a look at the new rare spawns on the Isle of Thunder. Thanks to Simca (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/545200-Simca) for helping to gather much of this information. You will need to kill these ten NPCs to earn the http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/581/280/16/16/inv-shield-mogu-c-01.jpg Champions of Lei Shen (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/8103-champions-of-lei-shen) achievement. <br>

Ra&apos;sha (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/70530-rasha) is the eleventh rare spawn. He is somewhat weaker than the others, not an elite, and drops Ra&apos;sha&apos;s Sacrificial Dagger (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/95566-rashas-sacrificial-dagger).<br>
<br>
The rest of the rare spawns have a chance to drop a Key to the Palace of Lei Shen (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94222-key-to-the-palace-of-lei-shen) and Shan&apos;ze Ritual Stone (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94221-shanze-ritual-stone). Every kill also will reward you with 15 x http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/589/8/16/16/pvecurrency-valor.jpg Valor Points (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/396-valor-points). You can find a description of the encounter on the NPC pages. <br>

Patch 5.2 - Quest / Rare NPC Sharing<br>
One of the complaints that often came up in the Blue Tweets was people &quot;stealing&quot; mobs during daily quests or when killing a rare spawn. Patch 5.2 attempts to make things a little bit better with a new system that lets you share mobs. Currently, any mob that is flagged as a quest mob on live gives you credit when you participate in the kill, but Patch 5.2 takes this one step further. <br>
<br>
When you encounter another player killing a rare spawn or quest flagged NPC, you can just start to help them kill it. Doing so will increase the maximum health of the NPC by 50% and give you a chance to win loot, completely separate from the other player. If someone else comes along to help out, this will increase the health by another 50%, and give them a chance to win loot as well. You will still get loot with just one hit while the mob is alive, even if combat drops. <br>
<br>
This system allows anyone from either faction, in your group, solo, or in another group to take part in killing these NPCs and get a chance at the loot, without affecting your loot chances. For now, it only works for the new rares and big quest mobs introduced in Patch 5.2. Please note that this does not work for normal quest mobs (Kill 20 of X...), only the bigger ones that are usually named and have an icon on their unit frame. <br>

Blue Tweets<br>
Classes<br>
My point is that you have never been able to balance classes in the past, this makes it even harder.<br>
But players want their guy to be the highest DPS so they don&apos;t have to switch. Not sure how to solve that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301066066849849344))<br>
I think it&apos;s impossible to balance say Fire, Frost and Arcane to be identical on every single boss. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301065886364749824))<br>
<br>
Positive feedback on what basis? Because on the PTR the seal hasn&apos;t been working correctly at all.<br>
While actual testing is the most valuable, I&apos;d say we get 75% of our feedback just from player reaction and theorycrafting. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301551845007036416))<br>

Survival Hunters - Black Arrow shares a cooldown with Explosive TRAP. Working as intended, but why? This baffles me.<br>
We don&apos;t want you to have to drop a trap as part of a single target rotation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/300330447290904576))<br>
<br>
Are you nerfing Silencing Shot because noone uses Wyvern Sting and Binding Shot? I think a better answer is SS as baseline! <br>
Silencing Shot is really powerful and the short CD just felt like too much. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/300330176066240512))<br>

Why can BM hunters Use Stampede in arena, And Dks cant use Army of the dead, It would be fun for Unholy to have this in arena.<br>

why nerf arcane into the ground instead of buffing frost with a small arcane nerf?<br>
Because Arcane is ahead of everyone else (along with Affliction). We&apos;d have to buff everyone else (including the bosses). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301073575736115202))<br>

would you consider the possibility of efficiently leveling as a Holy paladin (or ranged dps paladin new spec)?<br>
Have you tried it in MoP? Ranged Judgment with Holy Shock and Denounce works pretty well for DPS. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301073393388756992))<br>
<br>
GC, most Rets today are crying for sustained damage and not burst. Please re-evaluate this outdated assumption.<br>
Go look at my Twitter feed a month or two ago. I speculated we could nerf Ret CDs and buff sustained. The earth trembled. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301072914554445825))<br>
<br>
You know, youre giving WW an obscene buff in utility all around yet you give ret some small gimmick buffs. We need massive aid<br>
There are like 5x as many Ret paladins as all monks put together. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301079017350631425))<br>
<br>
Could you explain why you won&apos;t change Devotion Aura to also include Phys damage 5.2? At least for Holy Paladins.<br>
We don&apos;t want every CD to be a carbon copy. Mantid just happened to have a lot of physical AE. Not the case for every boss. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/300329242498039809))<br>

The 20% mindblast increase is a promising first tweak for shadow priests. Any chance mb haste scaling from ptr will come back?<br>
Explain why your DPS needs it. What percent of relative DPS will you lose in the course of 5.2 because of scaling? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301077576892428288))<br>
<br>
instead of buffing mind blast damage, why not scale the cd with haste? Would help stat scaling a bit.<br>
Will your relative DPS drop 10% over the course of a tier because of haste scaling? If not, why does it matter? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/300332397747118080))<br>
<br>
When are you going to stop focusing on disc all the time and pay some MUCH needed attention on holy? (PvE)<br>
We think Holy is in a really good place. They just get overshadowed by Disc so their representation is low. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301076727172579328))<br>
<br>
And you still lose 25% output in the stance you&apos;re not in while no others healers have to deal with this. Why?<br>
Chakra is the Holy priest resource. You could ask why Holy paladins need to build up Holy Power before using WoG or EF. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301033694360133632))<br>
chakra is a resource alright, a resource for frustration, and will to bump my head in the wall.<br>
Holy without Chakra is just a generic healer, a Molten Core priest. If you don&apos;t like Chakra, probably not a good spec for you. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301566803723825154))<br>
I know you&apos;ve talked about doing that before, and it really is the only way to make Chakra actually fun.<br>
We agree it would be more fun with more different spells per stance. Making swapping super easy just makes swapping not a thing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301574486254288896))<br>
<br>
Let me ask you this, do you think Sanctuary, in its current state, is a good spell?<br>
A good spell, yes. A high HPS spell, no, and it wasn&apos;t intended to be. You can layer it with other heals though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301566165392699392))<br>
<br>
so disc priest wont crit anymore but get a bubble instead... why are you nerfing priest so much? Being oom constantly sucks.<br>
Your crits will &quot;only&quot; be 130% but now non crits will be 130% too. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302866223715192833))<br>
<br>
will pws critting simply mean pws absorb is 2x or does it create da for 100% when crits? For pvp I hope it creates da.<br>
PW:S crit is just a double absorb. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302523444216602624))<br>

how many patches will the devs ask and wonder why rogues pop isnt high enough when we have been telling you for months energy<br>

Hey , i was wondering if the gear without a drop source on the new raid are trash loots or arent going to be implemented ?<br>
Normal drops trash loot (and there is no heroic trash). In LFR, you can get those pieces (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-difficulty-type=4&amp;filter-patch=16408&amp;filter-set=0&amp;filter-ilvl-max=540) from the bags that only have gold today.

Ra-den Limited attempts? Seriously? I am disappoint, #LevelALLTheAlts!<br>
At some point, cutting-edge guilds making 500 attempts a week is no longer a test of skill. It&apos;s a test of endurance. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302864096502620160))<br>
<br>
And that&apos;s not my standard. That&apos;s standard.<br>

I could see that if the 5.0 raids were en masse on farm, but they aren&apos;t. Most raiders haven&apos;t cleared Terrace.<br>
Most raiders have, because they play LFR, and they&apos;re ready for something new. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302531806937374722))<br>
How many % of players raid lfr, and how many % of players raid hardmodes? Have you got any current numbers?<br>
I do, but it&apos;s probably not appropriate to share them. A whole lot of people do LFR. Very few do heroic raids. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302866777677901824))<br>

<br>
do you take those metrics into account when tunning drop chances? Just curious, not complaining.<br>
No, we&apos;re worried that would cause a vicious cycle. We drop gear by number of potential users, not current class popularity. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301816453680742400))<br>
<br>
this is crude and simple but true. current progression: LFR-----------Normal---Heroics. should be: LFR----Normal-----Heroics<br>
