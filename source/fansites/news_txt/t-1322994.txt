Warcraft Movie Teaser at Comic-Con
Fans that were at Comic-Con this weekend got a treat in the form of a Warcraft movie teaser. It was a short clip that featured a human in the desert with a sword who comes across the skeleton of a solider. He takes a drink and then picks up the shield, which has the Alliance insignia on it. An orc then shows up and charges the human, with the clip ending there. 

Duncan Jones also mentioned that filming would begin early next year, so this was just a test shot for Comic-Con. Unfortunately, no recordings have shown up yet, and there are no plans to release the footage...

Classes
Do you ever get worried about classes being too similar or blurring the lines between what makes every class unique?
Constantly! It's one of the hardest problems for us to solve b/c nobody wants to feel weak in the name of class differentiation. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356134052501262336

Can you explain the move back to mana regen scaling with spi/gear? MoP took away mana regen scaling with int, why this then?
The problem with Int was it provided two bonuses for one stat. Spirit is only regen. It comes at the expense of other stats. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357519567788060672

Healing is becoming a spam/dps like activity instead of making choices. Changes coming next expansion? Water cooler topic?
It often comes down to mana IMO. The challenge is we get a lot of pressure to buff regen instead of healers having to make choices. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357510089344679936
As I've said before, the encounters are balanced around class output, not vice versa. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357510262896607232
But when someone struggles with a fight, the inclination is to ask for class buffs. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357510359776628736

in fact correct me if i'm wrong GC but didn't you say people have too many buttons to push already?
I highly suspect DS is already on your action bar. It's more about how big those action bars are. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357380902411706368
Not sure it's a triumph of game design that players feel like they need 4+ bars to bind all of their abilities. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357381055990345729

with the constant nerfs to prep/readiness/alter time, maybe it's time you stopped putting cd reset abilities into the game
We agree. I'm not sure that design angle has payed out well. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357145147483504640

That is because you design encounters that though out tons of AoE damage. You can't single target heal that.
We actually balance the encounters around the AE healing that groups can do. If we nerfed healing, the other would follow. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356932596581662721
How about speeding up ST cast time comparatively? So fast ST heals win for 2 targets but AE output wins for 4?
There is logic in that approach since one of the benefits of AEs is the GCD savings. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356940377690865664
To continue, we don't want every paladin playing like a Resto druid, and honestly neither should you paladins. EF shouldn't be mandatory. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355861121716076545
so if you dont want us blanketing the raid with hots and shields. Give us back burst healing. What exactly is our "niche"
What do you think you are missing for burst healing? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356133261174513664
stronger LoD/increased target cap would lead to less EF usage. 3 hp LoD is less effective than 1 hp EF.
But does it lead to priests, monks and druids wanting their AE heals uncapped as well b/c now they're left out? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356164302056591361
Sanctuary should be getting the HR treatment; 12? cap in 25's. 1-2k ticks with 25 ppl in it is sad.
It is extremely unlikely we will change the cap for any other heal as we did for Healing Rain unless it is a raid CD. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356934719553810433

Why compare one boring bonus to another?
T16 at least requires you to do something. The T15 could have said "You do 5% more damage." Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356934013816012800

some time ago single-targets big heals on tanks didnt make healers to feel weak.
I think ST heals on tanks feels like it always has. I think ST heals on non tanks feels like a waste vs PoH, HR etc. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356172163532853251
Shaman have a strong mechanic to encourage weaving in ST heals to buff AE heals. Maybe others e.g. Serendipity need buffs. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356172340624760832

why have sheilds become the new version of HoTs, in every situation a sheild will be the better option then any type of HoT.
That has always been the case and isn't a design problem. The shields have become too cheap and easy to apply though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356167158713159681

Now that we're approaching the end of MoP. What class/classes do you think need a big overhaul in 6.0?
None. We will likely work to make the 3 hunter and rogue specs play a little more differently from each other. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356169971937722369

since u nerfed sp survival so much and disperse can be locked is it possible to fix the activation lag&make it work like block
Not sure why there should be unusual lag. Usually that comes from procs. Can look at it though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357515675545239553

Stampede buff was a PVE compensation for Readiness removal. Where are the buffs making Hunters coequal to Mages, Wls, Rogues?
We haven't done 5.4 tuning yet. In 5.3 we think mages and locks were often too high. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356173370817134596

Just wondering what plans are there to rework hunters BEFORE 5.4, taking readiness away is big, signature shots are quite meh.
In PvE, Readiness just makes opening rotations needlessly complex IMO. Not convinced there is a ton of depth or skill there. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356171023860768770

more hunter changes to come? Removing deterrence and adding charges to 2 abilities doesn't seem like an adequate compensation.
We aren't necessarily trying to compensate them defensively. We think PvP hunters need nerfs. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356166768953262082

3m Deterrence w/2 charges is worse than 2m w/Readiness. This is a big nerf to PVE AND PVP survivability. Intended?
It's 2 every 3 min rather than 1 every 2 min with 2 every 2 min once every 5 min. If that makes sense.... Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356135042688364544

Could you please clarify on the deterrence change? Is it generating a charge every 1:30 or one every 3:00 etc?
ATM which could change we increased the cooldown and added charges. Works just like Roll or DK runes charging. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356134533592137728

As a Fire mage -and only when playing Fire- I feel like I need the PoM talent. Will this be "fixed" if you think it should?
No promises, but I wish there was room for instant Pyros Fire? and say PoM poly talent?. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357518025219510275

why make PoM unaffected by AT? I am assuming it is a pvp change. If that is the case you need to find a new way to balance.
We fear Alter Time makes PoM a mandatory talent for Fire. We're not 100% sold on the change though TBH. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356895986662113283

it fair to assume that mages are considered in a good place? I notice they're rarely rebalanced or have talent changes.

Overgeared. Is something that should NEVER be said in current content. If that's the case, it's a #designflaw
It was shorthand. Heroic raid balance obviously matters, but very few players have that gear so it's not fair to nerf all. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356889790274207745

Plz allow Holy Pallies to judge friendly targets - will at least make SH more viable
Just so you don't have to switch targets? It's weird to Judge an ally, unless it healed them, which is a bigger change. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357511633561587712

SoB is explicitly scaling with melee haste. In practice, spell haste will always be higher for us.
But the point was to make it scale, which it does. Making it use spell haste is just a buff on top of that. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357382347823386624

Divine Plea doesn't return enough mana if it doesn't include short duration bonuses. I don't know how much pure spirit u want
Nobody's mana return should scale with trinket procs. I don't think you'd really want this overall. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356896236600700928
Any time you didn't game the procs like a pro, your mana would suffer a lot. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356896303093002240

I like that one better. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357374662293987328

Saw a change where Crusader Strike applies Weakened Blows. HotR going away, CS going away or incomplete change? Or wrong data?
Both apply WB. We originally wanted HotR to in the ST rotation rather than just being AE CS, but eventually caved. #acronyms Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356894736591761408

I know this is datamining. But Holy should have their version of Sanctity of B. tied to spell haste rather than melee haste.
The only difference really is the raid buff. If we were just trying to buff HS, we could just lower the base CD. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356893787248795650
By which I mean haste on gear affects SoB either way, which was the real goal. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356893857876688896

Datamining shows SoB affecting Holy Shock for all three pally specs. Are we all getting it or is it just a datamining thing?
We are trying it as a way to make haste a little more interesting for Holy. Too early to say if it will be an official change. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356893490619228160

Unless this glyph becomes a buff to DP, there is nothing with new DP to motivate glyphing the spell. Delete it.
The Glyph of Divine Plea will have to be redesigned. Considering a glyph to cut CD and mana returned by 50%. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356892853038891008

EF is simply easier to use and more effective, SS and SH both require maintenance without worthwhile benefit.
Yep. Which is why we're nerfing it. The synergy with mastery is just way too good given its other bonuses. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356173045292990465
The periodic of Eternal Flame still should not proc Holy paladin mastery on PTR. If it is, that is a bug. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355860869407711234
Just give up on Holy Paladins already. Everyone else with any sense has. #nofun #neverwillbe
If we had done that every times players asked, I think we'd have one spec left in the game. Maybe. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356134179450261506
Well paladins are pretty useless at this point. No point in bringing them.
They are the most common healer in 25 and second to Disc in 10s. Clearly someone is bringing them. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356172770733867008
Maybe the EF nerf sends them from hero to zero but I sort of doubt it. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356172895686361088

This point is simply because EF can handle mutliple targets at once. SS and SH are single-target abilities.
We could make EF limit one again but I don't think that would be very fun. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356171536203390977

If you dont want EF to be so "mandatory" why not buff Sacred Shield so it looks more attractive?
We'd like to. What do you feel it needs to compete? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356135114176073728
SS is already verging towards OP for Protection, It's haste scaling is a big part of why prot stacks haste,
it's possible to buff SS for Holy without making it even better for Prot though. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356168965124390912

Small throughput buffs are not what paladins need. We need a rework. Mastery is the only thing making us look competitive.
TBH, we hear this too often from every class in the game. The paladin healing toolkit is mostly fine. EF is a crutch. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356132913441542144
Now paladins aren't perfect. No class is. But they aren't horribly off the rails either as the forums would have you believe. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356133003770085376
Raid testing proved how bad paladin throughput is, not the forums. 25m raid testing will prove it even further.
Is this proof somewhere we can see and analyze? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356163651234824192

Can you give us any insight as to what the current ideas/plans are for Guardian of the Ancients Kings Holy?
We want it to key off of AE heals in addition to ST heals. Less use these days in that much ST healing on one target. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356134376460926976

can you clarify new selfless healer change? Judgment already gives a HP for all specs. With this talent will it now give 2?
Holy does not get J->HoPo baseline. With SH, they do. No change for Prot or Ret. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356891022363598848

Crit as a possible gearing strat sounds cool. But so does a viable Glyph of Illumination.

To even out with an unskilled discare there any skilled??? using 8 Raptures, DP needs to return 1200% spirit,not 405.
Rapture isn't really a mana return mechanic. It's a way of getting PW:S cost from cooldown level to rotation level. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356895235336437760
Honestly, can't imagine any raiding classes running OOM regularly these days unless they or their groups are doing something odd. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356895738925559809
It's very hard to just look at mana %s and make class comparisons. Time to zero mana under a variety of scenarios is more relevant. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356895386151043072
Then please compare how other healers drop spirit. MW Monks running 7k spirit and finish 100% mana is broken.
We agree that MW and Disc are eschewing Spirit at high ilevels that other healers can't afford to do. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357376039086862339

Weekly News Recap
This was a busy week, with two PTR builds, Proving Grounds, and Timeless Isle, so catch up on all the news!


July 14

We looked at the Season 14 Mage Armor Set http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3307-Season-14-Mage-Armor-Set-Patch-5-4-PTR-Notes-Update-Class-Blue-Tweets-News-Recap.
Death Knight and Druid teleport spells now return the caster to where they came from when cast again

July 15

There was another PTR build http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3308-Patch-5-4-PTR-Build-17191-and-Proving-Grounds-Preview with lots of class changes and new items.
We looked at Proving Grounds, with a preview of the DPS http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i94mzpQirfs&feature=player_embedded, Tanking http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnMjT1_xSt0&feature=player_embedded, and Healing http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3desG5HyFA&feature=player_embedded version.

Items are scaled to item level 463, but gems are not scaled down. Set bonuses don't work.
Flasks and food buffs are allowed, but potions are not. You also get a full set of raid buffs.
The UI elements timers and wave counters and audio were not in in the videos below.
The DPS video below just shows Gold for DPS, stopping a few waves before the end. This is a somewhat older version of Gold, the current version on the PTR is significantly easier. 


July 16

We took a very quick look at Timeless Isle http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3312-Patch-5-4-Timeless-Isle-Patch-5-5-SoO-Raid-Testing-5-4-Notes-Update-Blue-Posts, which has no flying mounts.

You can also buy Mogu Runes http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/752-mogu-rune-of-fate for 2500 x Timeless Coin http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/777-timeless-coin.
You can also buy http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/101538.jpg Kukuru's Cache Key http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/101538-kukurus-cache-key for 500 x Timeless Coin http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/777-timeless-coin, which will open any chest in Master Kukuru's cave. These chests contain Timeless Coins and other minor loot. 

The official PTR notes were updated http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3312-Patch-5-4-Timeless-Isle-Patch-5-5-SoO-Raid-Testing-5-4-Notes-Update-Blue-Posts with lots of new glyphs.
