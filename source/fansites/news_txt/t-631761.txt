Boubouille2009-01-24, 07:42 AMLunar Festival's Update - A few people on IRC requested a guide to complete the Lunar Festival achievements. I didn't post one because there is already an awesome Elders walkthrough on WoWWiki http://www.wowwiki.com/Elders and it should be more than enough to find the elders you're looking for. The other achievements are fairly easy and just require you to buy/use something from the Lunar Festival in Moonglade or from the NPCs in capital cities. 


Official Website update
The official website http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/ has been updated and its layout changed slightly. The size of the right column has been slightly increased and there are now a few ads here. You can also find a handful of quicklinks here to access your account management or the realm status page without going through the menu.

Tanking raid encounters with one specific class
Sarth + 3 is probably as close as it gets to one class having an advantage, but it may be too early to even pronounce that a problem. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14595069637-i-cant-be-mt.html

Killing Machine
We originally talked about letting the MH and OH both proc but at different rates Windfury does something like this. Then we became convinced that dual wielding by DKs would probably sitll be good even without the OH procs from Killing Machine. Now it is just main hand procs at a frequency of 5 per minute.

PPM is a statistical average, so you will see a lot of variation unless you test for a long time. But we'll keep an eye on this thread and the talent itself to make sure. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14578778025-killing-machine-bugged-gc-plz-review.html

MM and BM hunter DPS in 3.0.8
From my POV it was more like some smart theorycrafters possibly even on EJ came up with some numbers and then a lot of people adopted those as fact and started echoing that MM and BM would be uncompetitive. I don't feel that the community has really had enough time with the changes to figure out the nuances of specs that many people had abandoned for a long time. I still see discussions about whether raptors or wasps or moths!? provide the most dps.

From what we can tell, SV and MM are pretty close. SV may be slightly higher, but not by hundreds of dps. Affliction and Destro aren't at the same exact number but you still see both in raids for the time being. MM also brings a really nice group buff Trueshot Aura while SV provides Replenishment, and we take those into consideration.

BM is an easier spec to play. We tend to reward specs that are a little tougher to play if played very well with higher dps. Affliction and Mutilate are good examples, though we went overboard with Mutilate's dominance over other specs. If BM was simpler and provided the same or higher dps, then you would see 95% BM hunters which, no suprise, is exactly what we had. Some players will try SV or MM, decide it's not for them and go back to BM. If they couldn't make SV work, then their dps may be just fine as BM or else the drop will be so low that they don't care. At issue is how much lower BM can be than MM and SV before it isn't worth spec'ing into. Combat for rogues is too far below Assassination so that you take too big a hit if you choose to opt out of the more demanding Mutilate play style. Make sense?

Again I will offer that for 95% of players out there, your individual skill and gear are going to have more effect than your spec. Just because very good hunters or spreadsheets come up with the highest possible dps for Survivial, does not mean that *your* dps will improve as Survival or that you cannot improve your dps as Marks or BM. I know it's a tradition in WoW to adopt cookie-cutter specs, and to some extent we'll never get away from that. But don't absolve yourself of the responsibility for trying to maximize your dps. When the community suddenly shifts, it's because some smart player experimented with a new build and made that work.

Talent spec disparities
Okay, I think this is the disconnect. This is exactly what we want - 3 viable specs. We don't want BM to be the noob spec that serious players don't use. We also don't want it to be the spec that every hunter uses, which I agree is where it has been for some time.

My comment was that BM can't be both easier to play and do more dps. We can debate whether or not BM is actually easier to play, but that is a slightly different discussion. Perhaps it is more fair to say that even though skilled BMs can squeeze even more dps out of their attacks, a BM player who did nothing but Steady Shot and use the pet could still do very high dps, which is not what we want.

If BM becomes too unpopular with these changes, if it becomes no longer viable in PvE or PvP, then we will fix it. The problem was that for a long time BM was the only PvE spec and it had increasingly become the leveling and PvP spec too.

I think some of my Ulduar comments have been taken out of context or misunderstood. We are making some changes to hunters. Some of them are pretty cool. We will have to rebalance many of the attacks at that time. For example, we are likely to add additional pet talents that increase dps so that the 4 bonus points from BM 51 will inflate player dps overall.

Beast Mastery over-nerfed?
As many of you pointed out, the hunter class does have a lot going on and we don't think everyone is going to be operating near their max potential with all ofthe changes after less than a week of raiding and Arenas turned off half the time. If after that time BM continues to lag behind, we’ll buff it. We just don’t want to do it in such a way that sends every hunter stampeding back to that spec. If that happens, I will have no problem admitting we over-nerfed BM. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14578748409-hunter-bm-and-mm-are-broken.html

Mage Armor increasing DOT effects
No, seriously, this is a known bug that we will be fixing soon. The irony is we think it was caused by trying to get Strangulate to obey silence-reducing effects. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14595029777-mage-armor-is-bugged.html

Developer Q&A
I just wonder, do the Blizzard devs think that Disc is turning out the way they imagined? 
Yes. I am very happy with it. The designers who worked on Disc did a great job. It was a good PvP spec before but now is also a viable PvE spec, yet with a different healing vibe than Holy. 

Are there any mechanics of the tree that might get tweaked soon? 
Yes. Spirit and Penance come to mind. No, they're not nerfs. 

I've also heard that some Disc Priests complain that it doesn't scale as well as Holy at extremely high gear levels. Is this an issue that is being looked at, or is it not considered significant? 
There are no extremely high gear levels in the game so it's a little premature to worry about. We do need to make sure Discipline's tools scale with spellpower and other stats as do other healers.

Last and perhaps most importantly, is there any possibility of either getting separate Disc armor sets, or set bonuses/stats that appeal to Holy and Disc equally? Currently, I find the Holy sets to be great but not ideal: I'm aware they were not designed for my specc. 
Bonuses we might do. Sets are unlikely. A big direction for us this time around was to drop fewer unique types of armor, but let players customize them towards their own play style with gems and enchants.

Hunger for Blood
We think it can be a little annoying to try to keep it up all the time. We have a plan to make it a little more usable and interesting and buff rogues in PvE at the same time. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14594929774-hunger-for-blood.html

Yes. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14594929774-hunger-for-blood.html

Assassination and rogue DPS in PvE
Assassination is doing too much damage relative to other rogues. Rogues as a whole are still too low in PvE and we have plans to bring them up. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14578748409-hunter-bm-and-mm-are-broken.html

Demonology
We'd love to see some more players try Demonology in a raid setting. I think it has a stigma from being the PvP spec in BC, but some of our numbers suggest you can do a lot of damage with a Fel Guard. That Immolate Aura can do a lot of damage too if you can keep stuff close to you. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14578688869-metaruin-viable-in-pve-now.html
