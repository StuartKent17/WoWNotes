Developer Interviews<br>
We&apos;re continuing to take a look at new information from the BlizzCon developer interviews.<br>
<br>
Kotaku Discusses PVP with Devs<br>
Kotaku (https://kotaku.com/blizzards-plan-to-take-wows-world-pvp-back-to-its-glory-1820311638) talked about the new PVP decisions with the WoW Devs.<br>
<br>
<br>
The new World PVP system allows all players to experience PVP if they want.<br>
Ion admits that the team hasn&#x2019;t done a very good job in terms of World PVP and are looking to breathe new life into it with BfA.<br>
World PVP can never be 100% fair, but the pace and combat can be worked on.<br>
The team is looking into implementing the level scaling feature into World PVP as well.<br>
The team doesn&#x2019;t want the sense of progression to be lost in World PVP by using the PVP templates.<br>
<br>
WoWChakra Interviews Shani Edwards and Ray Cobo<br>
WoWChakra (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5FnvzHBs64) sat down with two of WoW&#x2019;s game producers.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/F5FnvzHBs64?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
The Artifact Weapon sendoff will take place just before the expansion.<br>
There are some preliminary requirements to starting the quest chains for Allied races - such as getting exalted with highmountain tauren before you can proceed.<br>
There might be some story for the Void Elves in 7.3.5.<br>
The alliance will get to experience an epic story involving Jaina and where she has been.<br>
Jaina will have some family problems in the expansion.<br>
&#x201D;Sneaky Pete&#x201D; is a rogue Island AI character that likes to wait until you engage mobs to attack you. He is a jerk.<br>
The team is hoping to start beta early next year.<br>
The goal is to have Battle for Azeroth launched in 2018.<br>
<br>
<br>
BlizzPro at the World of Warcraft Press Conference<br>
BlizzPro (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZv_Ln9dFdg) released a video of their visit to the World of Warcraft Press conference.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZv_Ln9dFdg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Other examples of Island consumables could be group &#x201C;thorns&#x201D; or ways to bounce mobs between each other to stun lock them.<br>
The Island AI will also hit harder than normal mobs.<br>
Some Island scenarios, mobs and abilities may only appear on higher difficulties.<br>
PVP Island Expeditions might not activate all of your PVP abilities.<br>
Professions also come into play for Island Expeditions - a miner can mine Azerite nodes faster around the islands.<br>
The emissary system might influence the way Island Expeditions are done.<br>
The team likes the idea that you build up a bank of content to do (such as emissaries) and want to use it on more features.<br>
The team likes that there will be synergy choices with the different slots of the Heart of Azeroth.<br>
Higher item level gear&#x2019;s abilities may have higher Azerite level requirements to unlock.<br>
Warfront events, commanders and AI choices are all random.<br>
Communities are not replacing guilds. They are simply giving players the ability to have a variety of communities in game outside of their guild.<br>
The goal is for players to be in as many communities as they want.<br>
End game raiding in BfA will play out much like Legion.<br>
A lot of old pet models were updated including chickens and cats.<br>
There is a new cat model that is fat and fuzzy.<br>
The stat squish numbers are open to player feedback.<br>
Battle for Azeroth includes a character boost.<br>
<br>

<br>
A new addition to Legion is what we&#x2019;re calling micro-holidays. Each one is meant to make the world feel more alive without making players feel like they need to participate for big rewards&#x2014;while still providing some more variety and fun.<br>
