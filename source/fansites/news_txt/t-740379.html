Cataclysm Beta - Build 12539<br>
A new build has been deployed on beta realms. <br>
<br>
Important - Login Fix<br>
Hi guys,<br>
<br>
We&apos;ve made some changes to the login server, however these changes didn&apos;t quite stick. You will not be able to login without doing the following:<br>
<br>
1. Navigate to the following folder in your beta install.<br>
~\Data\enUS**<br>
2. Open up your realmlist.wtf file with a text editing document.<br>
3. Change the &quot;set portal public-beta&quot; line to &quot;set portal public-test&quot;<br>
4. Save this change.<br>
<br>
At this point you should be able to login normally.<br>
<br>
**This folder will differ depending on which language you installed WoW Beta with. For example if you have a German install, the folder will be deDE.<br>
<br>
If you still have issues with logging in please post here!<br>
<br>
Thanks guys and sorry for the inconvenience. <br>
