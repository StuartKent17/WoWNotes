Providing Feedback<br>
I poked fun at it because I felt it was worth calling out that that&apos;s not a good plan for getting your feedback across. I assume that community managers and others reviewing the forum generally won&apos;t look kindly on someone posting 23 times in a row (and rightly so). Beyond this I&apos;m going to leave their job to them though; I&apos;m just here to talk about feedback and this forum.<br>
<br>
Viewing this forum (or any other) as a contest for who most deserves a blue response is never going to give a satisfying result. Chiefly because that&apos;s not how we actually use the forums. We use it as a place to sift through a very large number of posts and try to collect actionable feedback reasonably efficiently. We&apos;re primarily reading more than posting, and what we care about is clear, specific, and non-hyperbolic feedback. I don&apos;t have a full-blown thesis on how to best do that, but a few thoughts I have regularly while reading:<br>
<br>
--Narrower issues/discussions are better. If you say something specific about something that goes wrong or feels bad whilst trying to use an ability, we tend to take notice regardless of whether there&apos;s an immediate result. On the flip side; the problem of large-scale DPS balance is virtually always intractable on a forum thread.<br>
<br>
--Talking about any outcome you desire besides more power for your character is virtually a requirement for feedback to mean much (everyone always wants more power for their character).<br>
<br>
--Change may not happen quickly. One requirement for healthy long-term communication is being able to have interactions other than &quot;we&apos;re changing this right away.&quot; Sometimes (often) we&apos;re not changing something right away even if we don&apos;t like it--and there&apos;s nobody with a bigger list of things to potentially improve than us.<br>
<br>
Part of having this forum, as I&apos;ve mentioned, is trying to post a little more on our thinking and philosophy (instead of only on immediate action). We like open communication and feedback because of how valuable it is for us to have as much insight as possible into what&apos;s happening with players (at its core, &quot;feedback&quot; is about telling us good or bad things that happened to you while playing--the closer you are to that concept, the better it usually is). And both us and players being able to get more out of it also requires that any communication be taken for what it is, not as an invitation to fight with us or with each other about which topics get a response.

Druid Class Mount<br>
Here&apos;s what I think is going to happen - druid flight form isn&apos;t going to be affected by the broken isles speed boost, other flying mounts are. Just like how ground travel form isn&apos;t affected by the broken isles speed boost but normal ground mounts are. Really hope I&apos;m wrong here, waiting to be pleasantly surprised.<br>
Good news! The Archdruid&apos;s Lunarwing Form operates like a shapeshift in terms of benefits (instant cast, immune to polymorph, etc.) but also counts as an additional mount in your mount journal.<br>
<br>
As for the second question, the movement speed bonus from Broken Isles Pathfinder I does not apply to flying speed, but druid Travel Form does benefit from the ground movement speed bonus in 7.2 (and this should be active on PTR)!<br>
<br>
Can people mount us in flight form? Please Muffinus. It&apos;s all I&apos;ve ever dreamed of<br>
You can, indeed, carry others on your back in this form. Enjoy! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/801390-druid-72-mount-travel-questions/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753109554?page=1#20))<br>

Holy Priest PvP Talents<br>
We really like the idea about resetting Spirit of Redeemer&apos;s cooldown upon death. We just snuck it in for 7.2!<br>
<br>
As for Spirit of Redeemer, we agree that talent competes a little too directly with Ray of Hope in what it&apos;s trying to do. It&apos;ll likely get some changes... eventually.

Affliction and Demonology Feedback<br>
Bear with me. I get that the idea is for various specs to excel in different situations. That&apos;s one way to approach the class design. But, let&apos;s assume, for argument&apos;s sake, that there are 3 ways to build an affliction lock, due to talents (similarly for demo or destro).<br>
<br>
Why would you use the talents to create the &quot;specialization&quot; inside of the spec itself, and largely let the spec determine how the class feels? Meaning, why couldnt each warlock spec have excellent single target, &quot;cleave&quot; or aoe dps, (via various talent builds) and let the player pick which spec he wants to play based on how that rotation feels? <br>
<br>
I happen to LOVE using MG and tunneling. I like for cleave i can throw out a few agonys, throw out a seed, and then go back to channeling on a high priority mob. I do not want to manage 2-3 dots on multiple targets very much in order to do relevant dps. I&apos;m worried that because I&apos;m affliction, you&apos;ll eventually revert to me being completely &quot;meh&quot; on single target if I&apos;m not multi-dotting. I hate that idea. <br>
<br>
Help me understand why achieving that (equal balance via talents between given specs) is difficult to do from a balance standpoint? Why does one spec have to be the &quot;single target&quot; spec, one a multi-dot, one a havoc.... etc?<br>
<br>
Please don&apos;t kill what I&apos;ve come to really like about affliction. I&apos;ve seen the &quot;de-homogenization&quot; at work recently (with holy paladin design from the WoD rotational style) and I just think the &quot;variety&quot; is better served in talents than it is changing the spec design every few months.<br>
The answer is probably that there should be some mix of both (quite possibly a mix we&apos;re still trying to settle into the right place, given that Legion greatly expanded the use of spec-specific talents that change your rotation). Both of the following are good things to have happen in the game:<br>
<br>
1) You really like the MG playstyle, and feel good when you&apos;re using it well, and feel extra good when that happens when it&apos;s also the highest-DPS talent for the situation.<br>
<br>
2) A fight happens to be perfect for Affliction (perhaps that should be sustained multi-DoT, but it doesn&apos;t matter right now what it is, just that some situation is) and you feel good as you shine on that fight, including making your raidmates of other specs/class temporarily jealous of you.<br>
<br>
#2 is more controversial I believe, but it remains true even in a world with some nontrivial barrier to swapping specs. Yes, one complication is the fact that some players will always care enough about min/maxing to put in the effort to overcome the barrier and play the &quot;best&quot; spec as often as possible. That&apos;s okay though; in fact, it&apos;s good to have it be up to players to make that choice of whether it&apos;s worth it for them. In 7.2, we&apos;re even reducing some of the oft-cited barriers to playing multiple specs through changes to the artifact and legendary systems.<br>
<br>
Without delving deeper into those issues, the point is that if you see your Demonology friend doing more DPS than you on one fight, and you do more DPS than him on the next fight, that is a fundamentally good experience to have players coming across in the game. It adds texture and meaning to the choice of specs. And on a more basic level, feeling sometimes slightly advantaged, and sometimes slightly envious of what someone else can do, is a much richer experience than feeling neither of those.

The new class challenge artifact appearances, was wondering do you need to do them for each spec or just one to unlock all.<br>
The challenges are intended to show your mastery of each specialization. You&apos;ll need to unlock each appearance separately. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/834195242706284544))<br>

Can I get some clarification on the Survival hunter 2pc, Some say its 3x and other say its 6x your mastery<br>
With the Survival T19 2pc, the total chance for your Flanking Strike to trigger Hunting Companion is 6x your base mastery. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/834179027019575296))<br>
