<br>
Cataclysm Friends &amp; Family Alpha<br>
The Cataclysm Friends &amp; Family Alpha just started. The banner below was taken from the official site where people eligible for the alpha can already copy their character (https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/beta-charcopy/). Let&apos;s roll. <br>
<br>
Important: The Friends &amp; Family Alpha is restricted to employee&apos;s friends and family, the only way to enter this phase of the alpha is to have a Blizzard employee request a key for you personally. Any mail you receive about a potential Cataclysm beta is a scam. <br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, we can confirm that the Family &amp; Friends phase of the testing process for World of Warcraft: Cataclysm has begun. The closed beta test phase has not yet started, but we will provide updated information when it does.<br>
