Blizzard just trademarked &quot;Warlords of Draenor&quot; in New Zealand. It was then registered in Australia shortly after. <br>
<br>
<br>
Computer game software, computer game discs, downloadable computer game software, computer game software downloadable from a global computer network, interactive multimedia computer game program; downloadable electronic game software for use on portable electronic devices such as mobile and cellular phones, laptops, handheld computers, and tablet PCs.<br>
Entertainment services, namely, providing on-line computer games; providing on-line non-downloadable computer games that may be accessed via a global computer network; providing online news and information in the field of computer games.<br>
<br>
<br>
It&apos;s also worth mentioning that warlordsofdraenor.com (http://www.warlordsofdraenor.com) was registered a month ago. <br>
<br>
I do realize that we had a lot of fun times with trademarks in the past (*cough* Dark Below *cough*) but let&apos;s just say that on a personal level I&apos;m pretty confident about this one. I&apos;ll leave the speculation up to you guys until Blizzcon. <br>
