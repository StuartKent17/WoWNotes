Boubouille2007-11-26, 03:59 AMUS Servers are up !

Tuesday November 27 Update
Update #2 : Added Wowhead links next to each weapon, you can get tooltips on mouseover. 
Small update with the few information left about the Season 3. 

Also, the bot monitoring game servers yeah, the name sounds nice will be deployed today and tomorrow on 
#mmo-champion on irc.quakenet.org irc://irc.quakenet.org/mmo-champion to warn people as soon as servers come online. Feel free to join if you're bored because you can't play.
We will be performing extended maintenance for all realms on Tuesday, November 27. The downtime will begin at 2:00 AM PST and end at approximately 12:00 PM PST. 
For your Season 3 buying pleasure, vendors will be made available in some additional locations. If you want to avoid the crowds in Area 52 there will be vendors selling the same items outside of the Nagrand and Blade's Edge arenas, as well as in the town of Gadgetzan.
Season 2 officially ends when the realms come down tonight for maintenance, which is currently scheduled for 2:00 AM PST, November 27. Information on the extended maintenance can be found here: Extended Maintenance 11/27 
Season 3 officially begins, including access to the Season 3 items and new honor items, when the realms become available after maintenance. Which is currently scheduled for 12:00 PM PST, November 27.

The season 3 is starting tuesday/wednesday on live servers and as usual, it's time for a nice recap for people trying to get their information at the last minute. I'll try to keep this news on top as much as possible for the next two days and might update it with a few things later. There isn't any item tooltips because it eats an awful amount of resources and wouldn't allow me to link my wonderful high resolution previews of arena gear.

Season 3 FAQ

With the end of the current season all previous recipients of the end of season titles will have them removed, and the titles will be redistributed for participation in Season 2. A unique armored swift nether drake, visually distinguishable from the Season 1 reward, will be awarded to the top 0.5% of teams. We’ve recently added new requirements for a team to be counted when determining the top 0.5%, which can be found here:  

Q: Can I keep my title from Season 1 even if I haven’t participated in Season 2?
A: No, the seasonal titles are intended to be a reward for performance in the previous season. Similar to a sports title or award, it’s handed off or moved to different players/teams as their performance rises or declines throughout the seasons.

Q: What happens to my Nether Drake?
A: You will keep your Swift Nether Drake, and a new visually distinguishable Swift Nether Drake will be given to the top 0.5% of teams for their efforts in Season 2.

Q: Any other new rewards?
A: As a matter of fact there is! The #1 team of each size, in every battlegroup, will receive a special "Merciless Gladiator" title. All other top 0.5% teams will receive the Gladiator title.

Q: So I’ve heard something about items having rating requirements?
A: Yes, the Season 3 weapons will have a personal rating requirement of 1850, and the shoulders will have a personal rating requirement of 2000.

Q: What is a “Personal Rating”?
A: The personal rating system is a new rating introduced with Season 3 your character will have for each team it’s on. This is in addition to the team’s rating which will still determine how many points you get per week. The personal rating is used for determining your eligibility to purchase certain items weapons/shoulder and for the end of season rewards. The personal rating uses the same formula as the arena team rating, but only for games that your character actually participates in. If you switch teams, the personal rating for that team size is reset to the default 1500. As an example, you join a team with a personal rating of 1500 and the team you join has a team rating of 1200. You play in 10 matches and win all of them; your personal rating may only increase slightly as your personal rating 1500 as compared to the teams you’re being matched against ~1200 is large. Meanwhile the team rating would increase as it normally would. In an opposite example, with a personal rating of 1500, and a team rating of 2000, your personal rating would increase substantially when matched and winning against other teams of a similar 2000 team rating. The personal rating requirement for the items only needs to be met by your personal rating from one of your teams, and it isn't required that you maintain a rating to continue using them.

Q: Why do the weapons and shoulders require a personal rating?
A: We found that many high end PvE players felt extremely compelled to obtain the weapons, as given enough time, and without a rating requirement, they’re guaranteed. There’s of course no guarantee that you can obtain the same weapons in PvE for use in PvP, and that discrepancy is the main reason for the change. With the personal rating system we can ensure that there is a milestone or achievement that one has to reach and that they can’t be obtained purely through a slow but steady acquisition of arena points. For the shoulders, they are in our opinion, the most visually impacting item and we wanted something visual that can distinguish those who are performing well in the arenas. They’re also not substantial stat-wise, and for those without the shoulders the set bonuses can still be achieved.

Q: Will I be able to track my personal ratings through the armory?
A: We hope to have this feature available for the release of 2.3, but they can always be tracked in-game.

Q: What happens to the Season 1 and 2 items?
A: The Season 2 items will be priced the same as Season 1 is now, and the Season 1 items are moving to the honor system, purchasable with honor points and Battleground marks.

Q: What happens to my rating when Season 2 ends?
A: Ratings for all teams are reset to the default 1500 for the new season. You still keep your arena points though, they aren’t diminished or removed.

Q: If a team isn’t counted due to the new qualification terms   do they still take up a spot for the season rewards?
A: No, if a team doesn’t meet the qualifications to be counted they will not be eligible to receive the end of season rewards. If there are 10 top teams that would receive the 0.5% end of season rewards and two of those teams aren’t qualified to be counted, the 11th and 12th teams will receive the rewards. They’re effectively ignored.

Additional questions
Will I keep my honor and arena points from season 2 ?
Yes, everything gained during season 2 is usable to purchase new equipment at the beginning of season 3.

Can I equip both season 2 and season 3 rings ?
Yes, that's how it was on the PTR. It could be changed on live servers but it's very unlikely.

Where are the vendors to buy Season 1 gear for honor ?
They're where usual honor vendors are, Hall of Legends in Orgrimmar for horde players and Champions' Hall in Stormwind for alliance players.
