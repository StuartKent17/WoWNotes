We’re pleased to announce a new collaboration with Scholastic, the world’s largest publisher and distributor of children’s books on a new book series for kids ages 8-12 —World of Warcraft: Traveler!

This epic action-adventure series features a young cast of Warcraft characters discovering the mysteries and majesty of the world around them. Written by celebrated comic book author and animator Greg Weisman, the first book will include full-page illustrations and sketches created by Blizzard artist Samwise Didier, along with a full-color cover illustration by Blizzard artist Stephane Belin.

The first hardcover book is scheduled for release in November of 2016. Read the full press release here http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/press-release/scholastic-blizzard-entertainment-announce-world-warcraft-traveler-new-book-series-bas.

About World of Warcraft: Traveler
It’s been years since twelve-year-old Aramar Thorne, a clever boy who is never without his precious sketch book, has seen his father. So when Captain Greydon Thorne comes ashore and asks his son to join him at sea, it feels as if someone has redrawn Aram’s entire world. Before he knows it, Aram is aboard the Wavestrider with Lakeshire fading to a distant dot on the horizon. But the thrill of adventure quickly fades, as Greydon relentlessly schools Aram on how to handle his cutlass and how to relate with the strange and diverse creatures of Azeroth. In addition, Aram struggles to get along with the Wavestrider’s crew—especially second mate Makasa, a tough teenaged girl who has been reluctantly placed in charge of him. Just as Aram starts to get his head above water, a band of vicious pirates attack the Wavestrider, turning his world upside down once again. As Aram tries to find his way home with his father’s compass in hand, he’ll travel across Azeroth’s beautiful and hostile terrain, encountering creatures both terrible and wondrous. He’ll seek to understand Azeroth’s denizens as he draws them in his sketchbook, forming unlikely friendships along the way. But the journey is hindered by Greydon’s compass, which never points north. If the compass isn't leading Aram and Makasa home--to safety--to what destiny is it leading them?

About Greg Weisman
Greg Weisman has been a storyteller all his life. He’s best known as the creator of Disney’s Gargoyles and as a writer-producer on multiple animated series, including Young Justice, Star Wars Rebels, and W.I.T.C.H., and Marvel’s The Spectacular Spider-Man. He’s written multiple comic book series and two young adult novels, Rain of the Ghosts and Spirits of Ash and Foam. Greg lives in Los Angeles, California.

Between this, Snow Fight, and Pearl of Pandaria, Blizz is growing quite a library of kid's books. I enjoyed the others though, so I'll probably get these ones. Will there be new lore in them or is it a more personal story?
I'm not sure about new lore but it seems it could happen incidentally along the way. It's definitely more of an adventure/personal story from a very different perspective.

PvP
Will rated arenas and rated battlegrounds reward honor in Legion? count towards the new honor system
Yes, rated arenas and battlegrounds in #Legion will award honor - a bit more than their unrated counterparts. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/713082407700664322

What's the point of honor when gear is normalized? What's the incentive to grind?
Honor Points contribute to your Honor Level. Each level will unlock more Honor Talents, etc. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/713118492824698881


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
listening to? Where do you get your feedback, and what makes it more valid than the "vocal minority"
You do see that phenomenon sometimes. Reddit says X but when you talk to more players it turns out to be Y. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/713045488027611136
But I would not then just dismiss X. It's rarely a binary X or Y decision and the details are quite valuable information. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/713045635411279873

The problem is with that statement is every other company bought by a large publisher says otherwise when its over
Well, I've been through this three times now. I felt Microsoft's presence pretty quickly. Not so with Activision or Tencent. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/713045245986865154
