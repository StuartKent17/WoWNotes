New patch on PTR, only affecting arena gear swapping. You can now swap gear in the starting room, but not after the start of the fight. <br>

Malganis in CoT : Stratholme<br>
Yesterday, a few people mailed me about the fact that you kill Mal&apos;ganis in CoT : Stratholme according to Tigole in the interview. They said it was impossible because Mal&apos;ganis plays an important role in Northrend, don&apos;t worry, he&apos;ll still be here. <br>
<br>
Anytime you killed Mal&#x2019;Ganis in the Stratholme level of Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos, you only succeeded in slowing him down. His body would reform shortly thereafter to continue taunting Arthas and encourage him to take the path of insanity&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#xA6; and power. <br>
<br>
No matter what happens to Mal&#x2019;Ganis in the upcoming Caverns of Time instance, his mission to drive Arthas to Frostmourne will not be undone. <br>

Draenei Male shoulders<br>
Orc shoulders are getting fixed ... But it seems that Draenei shoulders became smaller in one of the PTR patch too. I&apos;m not sure how much they scaled them down but it&apos;s an intended change.<br>
<br>
This was an intended change, Male Draenei shoulders were larger than intended before.<br>

Gilneas<br>
Sorry, no Gilneas (http://www.wowwiki.com/Gilneas) anytime soon.<br>
<br>
At this time, the nation of Gilneas which stands behind the Greymane Wall remains a secluded mystery. One day we may see the portcullis and the region open to visitors and explorers alike, but we do not know when or if that day will come.<br>
