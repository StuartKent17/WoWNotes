Q : hopefully, first week of october.<br>

2.3 unofficial patch notes<br>
Update 3 : Update 3 is here, let&apos;s hope I won&apos;t run out of colors. Huge update about dungeons quests, cenarion expedition mount is 280% speed and added a factions category.<br>
Update : Second update is here, also added a different color for it along with the new number.<br>
<br>
Well, they&apos;re not really patch notes, but we&apos;ve seen tons of posts concerning class changes in 2.3 lately (probably because the 2.2 went live), and it&apos;s way easier to list them like patch notes instead of doing 300 blue posts report. I planned to do them myself but bumped into this post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1778027018&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=1) in the way, which means that these notes are heavily based on it. <br>
<br>
Anything with a (1) next to it has been updated during the first update, (2) will be the 2nd one ... etc. New updates are posted at the top of each category to make them easier to find<br>
<br>

(3) You can now ctrl+click recipes to get a preview of the crafted item in the dressing room.<br>
(3) All items of the auction house will be sorted server side, basically it means that when you&apos;ll try to sort a particular item by price, it will sort it through all page, not only the current one.<br>

Raids &amp; Dungeons<br>
(3) New daily quests are available in the Lower City for 5 man heroic and non-heroic dungeons (Once at a time, a bit like battlegroundw weekends, each day you will get quests for a different dungeons). The following non-heroic dungeons are concerned : Shattered Halls, Steamvault, Shadow Labyrinth, Black Morass, Botanica, Mechanar, and Arcatraz. All dungeons will get quests in Heroic mode. If you&apos;re getting the non-heroic and the heroic quest on the same day for the same dungeon, you can complete both by running it in heroic mode once. Non heroic quests will reward you with a Ethereum Prison Key (various reputation), gold, and reputation with the Consortium. Heroic quests will give you 2 Badges of Justice, gold, and reputation with the Consortium.<br>
(2) Mobs inside Sethekk Halls will now continue to award Lower City reputation all the way into Exalted. Previously they stopped giving reputation in non-heroic mode just before players hit revered.<br>
(2) The number of creatures that must be killed in the Karazhan Servants Quarters area before a miniboss spawns has been reduced.<br>
New Title - Champion of the Naaru: Awarded to those who complete the Tempest Keep attunement quest at level 70. (Won&apos;t be available anymore at lvl 80) (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1778014822&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=19#371))<br>
Heroic Badges drop from Zul&apos;aman and Karazhan bosses.<br>
The amount of items available from the Heroic Badges vendor has been considerably increased. <br>
New 10-Man Raid - Zul&apos;Aman!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Zul&apos;aman<br>
Zul&apos;Aman will be a 10-person raid zone<br>
Zul&apos;Aman will be on a quicker reset than 7 days (some might call this &quot;casual&quot;)<br>
Zul&apos;Aman will be MORE difficult than Karazhan and drop better loot (some might call this hardcore)<br>
Zul&apos;Aman will feature 6 bosses and it&apos;s our goal that you can kill them all in one night -- perhaps 2-3 hour clear times (some might call this casual)<br>
Zul&apos;Aman will not have a key requirement. Nor will it have an attunement quest\ (some might call this casual)<br>
Zul&apos;Aman will have a VERY challenging timed quest for those who choose to participate in it. This *will be* hardcore and will be very rewarding. Players do not have to engage in the timed run (very similar to the Baron run in Stratholme)<br>
We&apos;re tuning the first boss in Zul&apos;Aman to require less raid coordination than some other raid bosses. He will still hit very hard so you&apos;ll need to be geared properly but it won&apos;t take 15 minutes to explain the fight. It will be a simple yet challenging fight. The other boss fights get more complex and challenging from there. If players want a basis of comparison, imagine the tuning of ZA started around Nightbane/Prince difficulty and ramped up from there.<br>

Arena and personal rating requirements in 2.3<br>
Finally got some values and information about the new &quot;personal rating&quot;<br>
Well to start we&apos;ll just let everyone know that the arena RATINGS (not the number of points they&apos;ll cost) required to purchase the season 3 items will be 1850 for the weapons, and 2000 for shoulders. The rating will not be required to continue using the item, only to initially purchase it.<br>
<br>
Now, most people have expected the weapon rating since we announced it at BlizzCon, and it&apos;s a bit lower than we had initially said, but the shoulders are obviously going to raise some questions. The shoulders for any set are commonly the most visually representative, they&apos;re the most visible at any distance, and as they allow a lot of space compared to say a leg or bracer item, we commonly take them and really create something visually impressive. We want that visually impressive item to represent what a player has achieved, and so the achievement of being a contender in the arena at a higher level will be visually distinguished. The shoulders are also average in the benefit they provide, as compared to a chest or leg item for example, and without them the set bonuses can still be completed.<br>
<br>
This raises the question of a player finding a team that is of a skill level higher than their own, and simply buying the item with points they&apos;ve gained at a lower rating. To restrict this we&apos;re implementing a personal rating system in patch 2.3. This is an additional arena rating that is unique to each character for each team they belong to. This rating rises and declines using the same formula as the arena team rating, but only in games that character participates in. You&apos;ll also be able to track this rating through the PvP interface. The personal rating will be used for purchasing items that require a specific rating, and also be used to determine eligibility for the end of season rewards. So, a player will have to achieve a specific rating, and not just get into a team to see the rewards that are meant to visually distinguish the high-rated players.<br>

Battlegrounds daily quest<br>
We&apos;ve got more details on battleground daily quests now.<br>
We have some new daily quests targeting a random battleground each day. You&apos;ll want to keep an eye out for Alliance Brigadier Generals and Horde Warbringers near your faction&apos;s battlemasters in all major capitals. The battleground daily quests will reward gold, experience, and honor. You&#x2019;ll be able to begin these as soon as you&#x2019;re able to enter the battlegrounds themselves. So if it&#x2019;s a WSG day, and you&#x2019;re level 11, you can take the quest.<br>

2.3 Fast release<br>
Zul&apos;aman and most likely the 2.3 patch will be released fast according to all the details we&apos;re getting.<br>
Zul&apos;Aman is done. We just need to get the raid dungeon on the public test realms, and make sure it sees extensive testing. Don&apos;t worry, it won&apos;t require the same amount of testing as voice chat. I feel few truly understand what it took to impliment voice chat, and test it properly.<br>

New Cenarion Expedition mount in 2.3<br>
Daghorn, a french Community Representative said in a blue post that a new mount will be added to the Cenarion Expedition in 2.3. It&apos;s included in the patch notes above but I guess some people will want a translation of the source.<br>
Concerning flying mount, we plan to add a new one in the 2.3 patch. It will be buyable from the Cenarion Expedition once you&apos;re exalted and it should cost about 2000 gold.<br>

1 hour delay on AH mails<br>
So ... why are the money from your AH sales delayed ? <br>
This is in addition to the mail change that we made previously in patch 2.1.3. By adding in the delay we can better track transactions to assure the legitimacy of them. This change will help us to better ensure the legitimacy of such transactions and further prevent the unlawful influx of currency into each realm&#x2019;s economy. Players will still receive their items immediately, but it will take one hour for the coins to show up in your mailbox.</div></div>
