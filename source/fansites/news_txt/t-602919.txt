Bad news, I forgot to add two new WotLK screenshots to the news last week. Good news, I thought it would be a good idea to create a few WotLK pages on the site. Most of these screenshots/artworks/wallpapers are from the official site, the Blizzcon, and the Games Convention so don't expect tons of new things but you probably didn't see all of them.

Illidan China first kill
It's a bit late for first kill news, but this one is impressive. Burning Crusade was released in China on September 6th and yesterday a chinese guild called "The Seven" killed Illidan for the first time, that's about 7 weeks to clear Serpentshrine Cavern + Tempest Keep + Black Temple, not counting minor instances like Karazhan, Gruul's Lair and Magtheridon's Lair. That's probably the first killshot of Illidan with so many people still wearing their Tier 3 gear.
