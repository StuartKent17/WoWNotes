Patch 5.1 PTR Notes Update - November 8<br>
Only changed and new notes are below, see the full notes on the Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/239910-patch-51-public-test-realm-now-live/).<br>
General<br>
The Pandaren Campaign begins!<br>
<br>
Players can visit their faction strongholds in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms to begin the quest to summon their war fleets to the continent of Pandaria. (Alliance players that couldn&apos;t previously complete the starting quests can now speak with Taradormi at Lion&apos;s Landing to travel the timeways and experience those quests... BACK IN TIME).<br>
Players can follow the story of the Pandaren Campaign through a series of special quests tied to their reputation with the landing forces. Heroes assisting with the war effort will join key characters and faction leaders as the growing conflagration spreads across Pandaria... as well as other locations around Azeroth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Brawler&apos;s Guild<br>
<br>
Entry into the brawler&#x2019;s guild is by invitation only. Invitations can be found on the black market auction house, by invitation from somebody within the guild, and occasionally as drops from certain Horde and Alliance NPCs.<br>

<br>
Sunsong Ranch<br>
<br>
A new Seed has been added: Portal Shards<br>
<br>
A mage who fell on hard times back in Dalaran has found a new home on Pandaria. Barnaby Fletcher will occasionally visit Halfhill Market to peddle a new type of seed &#x2013; and take advantage of the Tillers&#x2019; hospitality.<br>
Portal Shards grow into consumable items which can be used to open a portal from Sunsong Ranch to a major faction city.<br>
<br>
Seeds now stack to 50.<br>
Runty crops now have a spell visual to help call attention to themselves.<br>
Growing crops now display the duration until the crop is ready to harvest.<br>

<br>
Non-boss enemies in Mogu&apos;shan Vaults, Heart of Fear, and Terrace of Endless Spring now respawn much more slowly.<br>
