So you say dps shamans are underperforming yet you nerf enhances set bonus? Logic much?<br>
If it was a badly tuned for Ret, it was badly tuned for Enhance. We can find another way to help. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/543183048116674561))<br>

PvP<br>
Will we be able to purchase conquest gear with honor after earning 27,000 conquest for the season?<br>
no. That was primarily for offsets and the gear just changes now. Unnecessary going forward. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/543425574543577088))<br>
<br>
Suggest making PvP trinket set bonus a buff on player so it&apos;s possible to choose targets accordingly.Take advantage of no setbonus<br>
you just want transparency of the bonus? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/543536897075585024))<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
I get that people asked for it, but if you can buy both then why bother with choices/branching paths at all?<br>
You can&apos;t swap till you finish the zone and hit max level, still a decent amount of time with that bldg (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/543301196543307776))<br>

Reputation / Questing<br>
So frustrated at Apexis dailies. Spend 90% of my time running around trying to tag a mob. So is everyone else. Can we at least share the elites? Would make it feel more like joining a battle than competing to push a button first.<br>
Try joining a group! Use the new Group-Finder button to join a group in progress doing that content. Give it a try! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/543117573483544577))<br>
