Patch 5.3 - Heirloom Shields
Patch 5.2 added two new Heirloom shields to the game, but there were some issues with them and they never were added to vendors. 

It appears the issues have been resolved, and we will see http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/93903.jpg Weathered Observer's Shield http://www.wowdb.com/items/93903-weathered-observers-shield and http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/93902.jpg Flamescarred Draconian Deflector http://www.wowdb.com/items/93902-flamescarred-draconian-deflector in Patch 5.3 at the cost of 2175 Justice Points.

Ghostcrawler on Tri Spec
It appears uniqueness is part of the reason we won't be seeing Tri Spec http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/march/ThirdSpec.png in Patch 5.3.

Stack ranking healers based on meters is like stack ranking cars based on max speed. It doesn't tell the whole story. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/328220602638942208

Are you guys really okay with months of LFR becoming useless by Valor Gear? All that time spent on gear is wasted.
Aren't you always replacing your gear every few months though? What is the specific valor concern? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327542805033525250

What's diff between reason Blizz used 4 shared lock-out vs. normal raiders feel complld to do normal+LFR each week?
Why do you run LFR as a N raider? What is there for you? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325342066139860992
Valor Points. At our current progression we are still scrapping for any source of upgrade. Plus the SP-A rep to buy.
You won't get additional rep for doubling up, but if you are on e.g. 3rd boss in N then it might make sense to do the rest in LFR. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325380040051261440
To be fair, that's fairly min-max behavior. If you're on 3rd boss on N, a couple more valor pieces isn't what's holding you back. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325380256229896193
Normal Raiders feel the LFR mandatory cus of the stuff. LFR ToT stuff ilvl should be = to 489 to prevent that.
If you're a N raider, you are earning 522+ ilevel. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325382465864736768
If you don't have much 522 because you're stuck on an early boss, then getting a few 502 probably isn't what's blocking you. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325382667862413313
If you like earning ilevel as fast as possible, by all means go for it, but I wouldn't consider it mandatory. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325382772493520896

Didn't you just hotfix nerf health in Horridon and Sounds like a gear issue to me. Those weren't mechanic nerfs.
We don't make fights that are target dummies. Nerfing numbers means you can afford more mistakes on the mechanics. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325404609424285696
As I said, if improving gear is fun for you, that's great. Just don't obsess unnecessarily over marginal ilevel improvements. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325404827528077312

We need Normal tuned down. The amount of non heroic guilds finishing Nrrmals in time is negligible
We're happy with N difficulty for 25. It was a little hard for 10s, but we made some fixes. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325341120282386432

for 'real' raiders progression is the motivation. raiding for loot is an outdated vanilla attitude.
That hasn't been our experience. Raiding is fun, but becomes less so the moment you stop getting rewards. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325307703071236097

What's with the can't release spirit until whole raid whipes mechanic? I find it kinda annoying I wish I knew why it was there
It solved a whole lot of problems where players wouldn't get credit or loot if they released before a kill. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325307384320892928

I'd always thought testing times are based on when you guys can get all *your* hands on deck to observe, no?
There's an element of that for sure. Being on the west coast doesn't always work to our advantage. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325032929992507393
If you're a two-night-a-week guild, are you going to sacrifice one of those just to help us out? I mean we appreciate it for sure. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325028945974161410
My point was we get a lot of testing by heroic raiders. It's harder for normal raiders to justify spending the time. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325028822175064064

It would have to be a sizable reward to get me to leave my guild groups for the thankless world of pug tanking.
We really don't want you to do that. I fundamentally believe WoW is more fun with friends than solo. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324701285473480704
Hard to believe that, when raid tuning means either settle for LFR or ditch underperforming friends.
Would you be satisfied if you could run Raid Finder with just your friends? Or is your expectation to run an easier ver of normal? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325032623074320385

What if..... you didn't change the ilvl or stats on LFR gear ,but made the gear blue quality.
A whole lot of players use LFR. We want to preserve the prestige of N and H raiding, but don't want to push folks out of LFR. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325029986446749696

in ToT almost every encounter has a tank swap based on a debuff stack, are we gonna see different mechanics in the next tier?
If we can come up with good ones. We and tanks soured on the "soak up the cleave" mechanic. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325028256287969280

I get bored whenever I feel I can't progress, be it gear or stuck on a boss or whatnot.
Frustration at lack of progression is a common problem. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325004829191720960
However, it happens when players can't kill a boss and also when they kill everything and run out of content. No progress. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325004939623550977

Actually you can force. Called remove LFG/LFR and you'll see 'communities/interaction' occur instantly.
Er, for some players, sure. Others just log off when they can't get a group. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324707938612686848
I had friends and still sat in chat for 2h looking for Arcatraz pugs. Not the best of times. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324708030291783681

why is mob tagging still in the game? surely fostering co-operation is a good thing?
It is, but tabbing SW:Pain on every mob in a zone isn't our idea of cooperation. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/326448031295733761

GC, will we ever see a return to the way VPs were awarded thru heroics in WotLK? Some people can't log in every day!
You can keep running dungeons on the days you can log in. You keep getting valor beyond the first run. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327957409437986817
In the DS model, 7 runs capped you. Now, takes 18 runs if you do 1 per day, and 1 more run per missed day.
Fewer players capped when it was 7 a day. Totally understand that that model worked better for some players. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/328226842635018240

What is your design for PvE set bonuses? Stronger as tiers progress? Or just fun bonuses, should people have 4pc or offpieces?
I personally like the idea that off pieces can be competitive, but it's a hard sell to many players and some designers. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327878152779083776
I know that for throne of thunder with thunderforged pieces alot of people will be dropping tier pieces for BiS thunderforged.
I think that's kind of cool rather than tunneling in on set pieces only, but we'll see how it feels in a few more weeks. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327882061979480064
Why do we even have off-set pieces? So that armor looks different? But all offset match set artistically anyway.
One reason is players like to match their gear easier with transmog now. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/328225418945650688
Another is that raid quality armor takes about a month for an artist to make and we make 22 including PvP plus weapons. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/328225711930372096

Challenge mode was the biggest waste of resources, unpopular, unappealing, not worth it. Scrap it.
Disagree. It's more popular than expected and I personally find it a ton of fun. It's cool to use all your abilities for a change. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327876034403893248


Exodus Done With 25 Man Raiding
Late last week Killars posted an interesting message https://www.facebook.com/Killarslol/posts/572309812789070 as to why Exodus http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/mal-ganis/Exodus is done raiding. They ended up in 8th place in Tier 15, down from 6th place in Tier 14. 

Yes, I'll confirm the news here for anyone not in the loop or questioning the rumors. <Exodus> will no longer continue to function as a 25 man raiding guild. No plan to go 10 man as of yet, but that really doesn't matter because 25 man is what the hardcore raiding scene really is about and Exodus will no longer be competing in such a scene.

Why? How? Well this game isn't to blame. In the last few years this game despite many people quitting and guilds dying isn't to blame for vodka/Exodus' demise it's the raiding community. I don't mean this is a pointing the finger sort of way, it's an inevitable sort of flaw in the competition of the top end raiders. You see... we've basically been killing ourselves off slowly since day 1. 

In the last few years we've certainly picked up the pace, but the "hardcore raider" is a dying breed and it's certainly becoming a more difficult breed to be a part of. What I mean by this is of course the time commitment and the level of shear dedication and determination it takes and costs to be at the very top. This isn't to poke fun, but to just shed light of why many people, and subsequently, many guilds will fall. Raiding for many many hours on end is fun, CAN be exciting, and at the end of it all can really prove who really wants that world first/us first/realm first the most. 

Unfortunately we hardcore raiders pushed too hard. Tier after tier we just keep adding to the insanity in both farming preparations and actual progressing. It's almost as if progression itself never really ends after a end tier boss dies. Combine this with Blizzard actually putting new content out faster, alts playing a big role, PTR/BETA, dailys, coins, BMAH, well... you just get lost in it all. Right now there are a few legit world first guilds left. The competition is slim because the competition is literally eating each other well not that literally. Good luck to everyone left in the race for this expac, but I don't know how much longer this sort of thing can last.
