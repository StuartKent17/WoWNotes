World first level 80 character is French !<br>
French people just run faster it seems ... Nymh - Drek&apos;thar [FR] (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek%27thar&amp;n=Nymh) was the first character to reach level 80 in the new expansion - Wrath of the Lich King ! Congratulations to him and his guild, Genesis (http://www.guilde-genesis.org) !<br>
<br>
In case you&apos;re wondering, there isn&apos;t too much fancy powerleveling behind that, just a healer out of group. <br>
