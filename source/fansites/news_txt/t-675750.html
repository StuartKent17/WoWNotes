The boss was properly tuned this time and a lot of guilds couldn&apos;t kill him this time. The news post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/raids-dungeons/us-ptr-testing-festergut-121551/) has been moved to the Raids &amp; Dungeons forums. <br>

Northrend&apos;s New Kalu&apos;ak Fishing Derby!<br>
Coming in patch 3.3.0, the esteemed tuskarr of the Kalu&apos;ak are proud to introduce to Northrend the Kalu&apos;ak Fishing Derby, a test of fishing skill with a healthy dash of luck! Every Wednesday beginning at 8 PM players can try to catch the elusive Blacktip Shark. Elder Clearwater sits in Dalaran for one hour awaiting the return of the quickest, most experienced fisher to bring him the first catch of the night. This champion fisher will be rewarded in-kind for his or her fishing expertise. Those who aren&#x2019;t able to return with the first catch will still receive just reward for getting the Blacktip Shark to Elder Clearwater before he takes his leave.<br>
<br>
It is said that these sharks&#x2019; favorite meal are the bite-sized Pygmy Suckerfish. Perhaps a hook in their waters will do the trick. Because of the increased concentration of fish, you have an increased chance to catch a shark from fishing pools. Don&apos;t forget, in patch 3.3.0 you never catch trash from fishing pools, regardless of skill.<br>
<br>
The derby winner will receive a substantial chunk of experience (or money at maximum level) and gain 5000 reputation with the Kalu&apos;ak. In addition, the champion will be given a choice between two unique rewards:<br>
<br>
[b] Dread Pirate Ring<br>

To keep it interesting, the Achievement &quot;Master Angler of Stranglethorn&quot; has been changed to &quot;Master Angler of Azeroth.&quot; This can be earned by winning either the Kalu&apos;ak Fishing Derby or the Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza.<br>
<br>
Please bear in mind this feature will be undergoing testing on our Public Test Realms and is subject to change prior to the release of patch 3.3.0.</div></div>
