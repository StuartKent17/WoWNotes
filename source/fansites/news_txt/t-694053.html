Upcoming Lich King Weapon Changes<br>
A couple of days ago a message was posted on the official Korean site (http://www.worldofwarcraft.co.kr/community/forum/view.do?bseq=&amp;currpage=2&amp;perpage=&amp;sortmask=&amp;hfilter=&amp;pseq=783705) to announce upcoming changes to the weapons dropped by the Lich King, as far as I know these changes affect both normal and heroic versions of the weapons. Thanks to locriani for the help with the translation!<br>
Good morning from the WoW community team.<br>
<br>
Some of the weapons from the Lich King are not as good as we had hoped. To encourage you to want these new weapons, we have decided to change some of the old combat ratings over to better ones. We have obtained a preview of these changes, for your perusal, on behalf of the Beijing development team.<br>
<br>
25-Man<br>
Royal Scepter of Terenas II (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50734/royal-scepter-of-terenas-ii/): MP5 replaced with Haste Rating<br>
Archus, Greatstaff of Antonidas (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50731/archus-greatstaff-of-antonidas/): Critical Strike Rating replaced with Haste Rating<br>

Lich King Video by Might<br>
Might (http://www.might-turalyon.com/) (US - Turalyon) released their video of the Lich King encounter in 10-man. If you check the first seconds of the Part 2 you will see the Frostmourne room that we couldn&apos;t see in the first video I posted. <br>

Lovely Charm Bracelet from killing blows only<br>
You can get these from any mob &quot;of worth&quot; so you can do any sort of kill quest to get these including from killing any mobs involved in daily quests. [...] Yes, it comes from killing blows. On my healing character, I&apos;ve had no issues with getting these, (other than when I forgot to have empty space in my bags for them.) <br>
<br>
[...] I did not get them from instances. It&apos;s pretty easy to grab a bunch of mobs and kill them solo and just as easy to get them via daily quests (or even normal questing) that you are working on as you&apos;re doing them.<br>
<br>
The event just started so, no, there are no current plans to change the functionality of this. Should we feel it&apos;s necessary to make a change, we&apos;ll let you know. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23041984974-lovely-charms-going-to-killing-blows.html))<br>
<br>
Tanking Cooldowns<br>
One caution is you have to be really careful in how you factor in cooldowns to estimates or simulations of tank survivability. Some attempts just assume that e.g. Barkskin is responsible for X% of damage not done over the course of the encounter. That might be true on some encounters, but it definitely is not on others. When you can or need to use those abilities makes a big difference. On some fights, those cooldowns just give you a little slop room if the healers have a lot on their plate or have to move or something. On others you just aren&apos;t going to survive without a cooldown. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/22748824209-explain-why-dru-hp-was-fine-but-not-pally-hp.html))<br>

Dispells in Cataclysm<br>
We&apos;ll talk more about the Cataclysm dispel design when we get a little closer. Overall the philosophy is that a dispel should be a counter. That means, to us, that you should have to consider when it makes sense to use. Dispels shouldn&apos;t be a test of how quickly you can mash that key when you see the icon pop up. Dispelling at the wrong time should cost you. We also don&apos;t want to see such extremely different outcomes depending on the class of dispeller you have with you.

<br>
Itemization in Cataclysm<br>
Actually, we aren&apos;t trying to make gear choices easier. We like when it&apos;s a hard call on whether to upgrade vs. stick with what you have, etc. In designer parlance terms, that is an &quot;interesting decision.&quot; Non-interesting decisions are typically no-brainers.<br>
<br>
We want to remove some of the confusion over a complicated stat system, which we think we can do without reducing the system&apos;s depth. In fact, the other motivation for the stats overhaul was to solve some of the problems where a certain stat trumps all or a certain stat is always junk. If we nail that, then gear choices will actually be harder in Cataclysm, not easier.<br>
<br>
As an example, when you aren&apos;t close to a crit cap and when buffs don&apos;t provide so much crit and talents don&apos;t provide so much crit, then haste vs. crit can be a pretty interesting choice. Haste lets you cast spells faster, but crit makes those spells you cast hit harder. At a very basic level you are choosing more spells vs. bigger spells, but because of a number of other factors, it&apos;s not that cut and dried. Haste may provide a dps increase for a caster according to a spreadsheet, but it depends and it might cause you to change your rotation. If you have spell A that hits so hard that you need to use it on cooldown, and spell B gets boosted by haste, then you can run into the situation where more haste on B isn&apos;t an improvement because you can&apos;t squeeze in another B before it&apos;s time to use A again. If you aren&apos;t able to capitalize on the extra haste, then more isn&apos;t always good for you. (That&apos;s in an ideal world. The way stats work in Icecrown, if you like haste, it&apos;s nearly always a no-brainer stat for you.)<br>
<br>
Comparing armor pen vs. say attack power is much mathier, because they really just both buff melee damage in pretty much the same way. The only time it matters is when you&apos;re near a cap or if you&apos;re a spec that does a lot of spell damage. But you learn pretty quickly for your spec whether armor pen is an awesome stat for you or just an okay stat.<br>
<br>
Many of your gear choices in Cataclysm should come down to haste vs. crit vs. mastery. You may still have one of those you like the most, but it shouldn&apos;t be double the value of the other stats, so you may have to look at the total package of stats on that item (Do I need more hit? If I take that hit, can I swap it out somewhere else?) Add in set bonuses and procs, and I&apos;m not sure the gear choice will be all that easy, but it should be easier to understand.

Vanish<br>
We tried a different approach to fix Vanish in a recent patch while it was up on the PTR. It didn&apos;t fix the problem (which has everything to do with spells already being in the air) and let rogues use Vanish as a second Cloak, which wasn&apos;t the intent. When we backed out that change, we said we were going to try a different approach where we calculate when spells are launched on the server side. Nothing has changed since then and I really can&apos;t give you any more information than that. Making more &quot;Lol Vanish doesn&apos;t work&quot; threads isn&apos;t going to speed that process along, and will just continue to annoy other forum participants. <br>
