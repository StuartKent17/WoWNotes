Tigole made multiple posts on Elitistjerks forums http://elitistjerks.com/forums.php concerning the elixir changes.


--Flask powers have been GREATLY reduced.
--Reagent costs for flasks have been ****GREATLY**** reduced.
--Flasks take up both your offenseive AND defensive elixir slots. 1 Flask or 2 elixirs -- you choose.
--Raid DPS has gone up Glancing Blow and Class Changes
--Encounters where DPS was not a "flasking factor" i.e. tuned around the HP flasks, elixir of mastery, defense etc. will be retuned.

Raiders will have access to easy-to-access flasks in SSC, TK, Hyjal and Black Temple. Dungeon goers will have easy access to potions in Coilfang and TK 5-mans.

For example, 1 Coilfang Armament = 1 super mana potion zone specific in the coilfangs.
