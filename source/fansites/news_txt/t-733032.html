People started releasing pretty videos of Cataclysm and I don&apos;t think I can do much better than that. The first 3 videos are from TotalBiscuit (CynicalBrit.com (http://www.cynicalbrit.com/)) and I might include his videos to more articles depending on the reception of the first three! <br>

Zones &amp; Instance Pages Update - Official Previews<br>
I updated some of the Cataclysm pages to include the official previews to add some lore background. I also fixed a couple of layout bugs and tried to improve the readability.<br>
<br>
The other good news is, I added Lightbox back to the new instances and new zones pages (the fancy screenshot viewer thing). You should be able to check everything without too much problem now, I will add it to the other pages tomorrow. <br>

Spell haste and Fireball / Frostbolt cast time<br>
I think the problem is actually with Early Frost. We just think that e.g. a 3.5 sec Fireball isn&apos;t really playable. You probably noticed that the low ranks of Fireball are even much faster, because the spell really isn&apos;t usable until the cast time is reduced.<br>
<br>
We are going to be much more vigilant about haste getting out of control (from talents and gear) to where GCD issues get to be a problem. Simply making non-haste stats more attractive will help as well. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626106700/what-s-going-on-w-mage-bolt-cast-times/))<br>

Discipline<br>
Discipline will still use PW:Shield a lot, but you will probably see less &quot;pre-healing&quot; across the board, because it won&apos;t be mana efficient. PW:Shield will probably go back to being more of an emergency button and less of the survivability buff it gets treated as today.<br>
<br>
In addition to shielding, Disc will continue to cast Penance a lot, and will probably use Heal and Greater Heal. Flash Heal overlaps in niche a lot with both PW:Shield and Penance, so it may be the least used. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626107959/save-power-word-shield/))<br>

Combat Tree<br>
Improved Sprint I will grant you doesn&apos;t have a lot of use in PvE.<br>
<br>
But Improved Kick and Improved Recuperate do. Improved Kick will be of situational use on bosses that can&apos;t be silenced, but Improved Recuperate will keep you alive. In a world where healer mana will be much more precious, minimizing wasted mana is going to be a bigger deal.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re not going to make trees where every point in a dps tree is a dps upgrade. Those are the kinds of talent builds we&apos;re trying to get away from, because they remove player choice. We are trying to engineer points in all trees where you have to choose between non-dps talent A and non-dps talent B, because as soon as A or B leads to dps, then the choice goes away.

Weapon Enchants<br>
Enchants are technically really complicated spells in WoW, so what we want to do and what we can do aren&apos;t always aligned without investing sometimes weeks of programmer time. I say that by way of heavy caveats, because none of this may actually come to pass.<br>
<br>
However, what we&apos;d like to do is: A) Restrict DW to Enhancement only, B) Restrict shaman weapon enchants to being unique (meaning no WF / WF or FT / FT), and C) Remove the internal cooldown on Windfury, since once you can only have one, the proc rate won&apos;t be a balance problem.

Passive survivability talents<br>
We just think at the end of the day that a warrior needs to look at their his talents and feel like they are making his survivability better. As an example, it&apos;s all well and good to have some fun or utility talents in the Disc priest tree, but if there also weren&apos;t some bread and butter talents to make you a better healer, Disc priests would feel cheated. Sword and Board is a fun Prot talent, but it doesn&apos;t improve your survivability directly in a very noticeable way.<br>
<br>
Imagine a new talent that was a 30% chance to lower the cooldown of your Last Stand, or a 30% chance to proc an armor buff on you. It might be an exciting talent, but it could also be really frustrating every time it didn&apos;t proc. For the same reason tanks tend to gear for mitigation over random avoidance, they&apos;d probably be really skeptical of a talent that had a chance of lowering their damage taken. There&apos;s room for some talents like that, and Critical Block is an example, but a whole tree of them might get frustrating. You might feel like your survivability was out of your control and really at the mercy of encounter specifics or even a random chance for a proc.<br>
<br>
Put another way, we want players to have some choices in how they talent, but we don&apos;t want the whole tree to feel optional. A Prot warrior who chose to spend no talent points should feel like a really terrible tank, instead of just losing some utility or threat, in the same way an untalented healer should feel like they are sacrificing a lot of healing. Thus we think there is room for a few passive talents, especially for tanks, where having too many non-passive talents risks hurting consistency.
