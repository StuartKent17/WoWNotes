Ulduar Encounter Difficulty<br>
There was recently a blue post (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216399-please-bring-back-whoever-designed-ulduar/) talking about the nostalgia people feel for Ulduar and the increased difficulty. Kaivax made the point that &quot;Ulduar is an example of a raid where lots of players got to enjoy the first few bosses, and very few players ever saw the last few&quot;. <br>
<br>
Ulduar isn&apos;t too relevant anymore, as we saw yesterday (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2646-Algalon-Solo-Kill-Iron-Man-WoW-Challenge-MVP-Program-Transmog-Gallery-MMO-Report) with a Hunter soloing Algalon, but we wanted to see how significant the drop-off of players was as the bosses got more difficult, so we looked at a sample that contains ~130k level 85 characters that completed Ulduar achievements before Patch 3.2 was released. The percentages in the chart are normalized to 100% for The Siege of Ulduar (10 player) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/2886/the-siege-of-ulduar-10-player/). <br>
<br>
This means that we are looking at boss difficulty relative to the easiest bosses, not the percent of the player population that completed each encounter. Keep in mind there is some inaccuracy, as the characters that made it to 85 may not include many of the characters who completed it at level 80 and then became inactive. <br>
<br>
Ultimately, out of the 100% players who completed The Siege of Ulduar (10 player) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/2886/the-siege-of-ulduar-10-player/), only 1.1% of them defeated Algalon in 10-man before Patch 3.2 was released. The 25-man version was even less accessible and only 0.38% of the sampled players completed the encounter. <br>

Love Is In The Air, So Wear A Mask<br>
With the onset of Valentine&#x2019;s Day, thoughts of romance and companionship plague the air like a masterfully-designed virus. Not even the realm of my dark masters is safe, for Azeroth is currently teeming with positive emotions due to the &#x201C;Love Is In The Air&#x201D; festivities.<br>
<br>
To further my understanding of these alien thought processes, I request your favorite canonical pairing in the Warcraft universe and why you believe this pairing works. These pairings do not need to be of the flushed quadrant; your favorite examples of companionship, friendship, or &#x201C;bromance&#x201D; are also needed. Should you provide this information, you are then entitled to also include your most desired pairing, but only if you also provide adequate reasoning for this union.<br>
<br>
In order to ensure proper formatting, below is an example:<br>
<br>
Favorite Pairing:<br>
Reasoning:<br>
<br>
Desired Pairing: A&#x2019;dal (void state) / Xi&apos;ri (void state)<br>
Reasoning: So turn the Lights off / I&apos;m not afraid / Afraid of the Dark (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/217387-love-is-in-the-air-so-wear-a-mask/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4063006294))<br>
