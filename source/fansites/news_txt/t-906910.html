It&apos;s time for the first real preview of Tier 12 armor sets! As I said in yesterday&apos;s news post a lot of Tier 12 sets got a lot of bad feedback from the community based on poor/rushed previews, I&apos;m not saying that they all look awesome but the Tier 12 Shaman definitely got some bad press because people couldn&apos;t render his effect properly. See for yourself. <br>
<br>
You can expect more previews tomorrow, and yes, I lied about the Warlock video being today, I had a slight issue with the female models and they just didn&apos;t look right. This is already fixed but I didn&apos;t want to delay the Shaman preview further. <br>
<br>
In any case, I suggest that you wait for the &quot;good&quot; previews before you decide if a set is good or bad and complain about it everywhere, for the sake of my moderators. <br>
<br>
PS: The armor set available to player is the fire one, the green one is most likely a recolor and will only be used for non-set or NPCs. <br>
