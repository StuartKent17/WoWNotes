As for the prepatch on PTR it should be soon™. When that happens you'll see the PTR forums go up and likely an announcement for it too. Keep in mind we're still around three and a half months out from Battle for Azeroth hitting live servers so there's still some time!

Mistweaver Monk Feedback
Using Enveloping Mist while channeling Soothing Mist with TFT active eats a TFT charge. This shouldn't happen.
Quick note--the TFT-Enveloping buff has a new instant heal component added on beta, which you still benefit from if you TFT-Enveloping during Soothing Mist. While this loses part of the value of the buff, it's still a reasonable option to provide for when an instant heal seems important.

All that said, one concern with the current setup on beta is that TFT-Renewing might dominate the other uses of TFT too often. Some of the exact bonuses it provides may have to be adjusted once everything else settles.

Druid Travel Form and Consent
Thanks for bringing this up. It would definitely be ideal for you to be able to have control over something like this, so even though there's not an immediate solution, I wanted to say we appreciate you making what might have been a difficult post.

On live, you at least have the option of Glyph of the Cheetah for the ground case, and as you mention, ordinary Swift Flight Form for the air case. I know that's not perfect since you may prefer to use other appearances--as we try to add more avenues for character customization, I hope we can find a place for this kind of option on Travel Form.

Unholy DK Beta Feedback Thread
Death coil being 40 RP is a bit concerning, but seeing as it's been changed it's likely it has been tested thoroughly.
We increased Death Coil's cost during Legion because the spec had an overflow of resources. We'll adjust Death Coil's cost to what feels right for overall Rune/Runic Power income in BfA.

Festering wound cap being reduced is ... interesting, but important to note that Festering Strike now only gives 2 wounds seemingly
Festering Strike applies 2-3 wounds now, down from 2-4. Felt it was important to allow you to at least cast 2 consecutive Festering Strikes initially without fear of overcapping wounds. Max of 8 was kind of a lot, and I think only felt necessary because of Castigator, which added an amount and form of randomness to wound application/consumption that we didn't feel was overall more fun for the spec, which is why the talent is gone right now.

The epidemic change using RP is wonderful! Definitely makes this competitive
Giving Unholy a way to deal convert Runic Power into AOE damage, especially outside of Death and Decay windows was the goal here. This change to Epidemic hopefully flows better: DnD -> Scourge Strikes -> Lots of Runic Power -> DnD ends -> Epidemic.

Corpse explosion is meh, could be okay if we end up producing a lot of ghouls/it's damage gets increased
We thought the fantasy of Unholy being about summoning lots of disposable pets/ghouls was worth trying with this talent. The main worry with Corpse Explosion is that it'll be too dependent on Apocalypse 1.5 min CD and Army of the Dead 8 min CD, so it's kind of not available often enough, and also might have to be too bursty. Separately tracking and timing your ghoul durations to line up with times when you need the AOE damage might be tough. Gonna keep an eye on this talent and see how it goes.

Bit sad Valkyr is going, but not surprised since it aesthetically didn't fit the theme of Unholy.
We were pretty split internally on Gargoyle vs. Val'kyr. Gargoyle is kind of more classic WoW Death Knight from Naxxramas and Val'kyr is the slightly newer WotLK Arthas Death Knight. We thought Gargoyle fit Death Knight as a playable class, a bit more.

Wednesday, May 2nd

MOTHER - Heroic Uldir - 13:00 PDT 16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST
Vectis - Heroic Uldir - 14:00 PDT 17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST


Thursday, May 3rd

Mythrax - Heroic Uldir - 13:00 PDT 16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST

Taloc - Heroic Uldir - 14:00 PDT 17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST


As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a Beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.

Q: How do I get into the raid zone?
A: In Zuldazar, Boralus, Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade III in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.

Q: What character should I use to test the raid?
A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players' effective level to 120 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounters being tested. 

Q: How long does testing last?
A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we're satisfied that we've received that information for a given boss, we'll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.



Battle for Azeroth Preview: Zuldazar Visitor’s Guide
Located deep in the Zandalar subcontinent and nestled in a primal jungle, Zuldazar is a remnant of the once-mighty Zandalar empire. Join us on a brief tour through the oldest city in the world and the majestic land that surrounds it, and get a glimpse of the flora and fauna that dwell in this ancient domain. 

High above the jungle canopies, the Golden Throne serves as Zuldazar’s city center, with some of the most breathtaking views in the region. It is from here that Rastakhan, king of the Zandalari, rules. A vast, ancient cityscape of interconnected terraces sprawls out below, dotted with temples devoted to the loa, which are maintained by their loyal servants.

Welcome to Zuldazar. 

Things aren’t as they should be in the great empire. The land is charged with dark secrets, and rumors of a rebellion swirl. As a representative of the Horde, you’ll need to earn the trust of King Rastakhan and the Zanchuli Council to gain access to Zuldazar’s resources and superior naval force. The Horde’s war efforts depend on it.

Visitors can find anything they need for an extended stay in the heart of Dazar’alor at the center of the city. Facilities include an inn, portals to all major Horde cities along with Dalaran, profession trainers, a bank, training dummies, vendors, and more. It’s easy to get lost this ancient, multileveled city—but that only emphasizes its vastness and grandeur.

Watch Your Step
If you’re determined to explore the city and its surrounding areas, you’ll want to pack your walking shoes and bring a well-rested mount. There are thousands of steps throughout Zuldazar. Just be careful to keep an eye out or you’ll plummet into one of the many thunderous waterfalls surrounding the city. But the view is breathtaking!


Things to Try: Take a ride on a Caravan Brutosaur! Trained to haul goods throughout Zuldazar, Brutosaurs offer a slow but steady ride around the city’s terraces.

A Shrine to the Loa
Worshipped as deities by the Zandalar trolls, loa are Wild Gods—or spirits of Azeroth. Many of the temples dedicated to these deities can be often found on high ground or mountain peaks, which are viewed as sacred ground by the devout.

Did you know? Atal’ai means “the devoted ones” in Zandali.

In the southern part of city at its lowest point, you’ll find the expansive Port of Zandalar. It is here that the Zandalari berth their mighty fleet and traders from around Azeroth sell their wares and services.

For those of sufficient might level 115 and have completed an introductory quest, Captain Rez’okun will facilitate access to Island Expeditions from the Expedition Map.

The Savage Surroundings
Zandalar’s rich tapestry of flora and fauna deserve research and cataloguing. The Zandalari have shown themselves to be able beast masters, having domesticated many of the creatures that roam the land. Some of these serve as helpful allies to the Zandalari; others prove obstacles to those who would seek to exploit the jungle’s resources.

Tamed Ravasaurs, Brutosaurs, Pterrodax, and Direhorns make up just a portion of their menagerie. There are countless other wild beasts that make their homes in surrounding jungles, from Muddy Riverbeasts to Roaming Nibblers.

Tortollan Knowledge Is Power
Both inside the city and beyond its borders, you’ll encounter a new race: the tortollan. These ancient seekers are constantly in pursuit of knowledge and the acquisition of rare artifacts. They’re always in need of brave souls to help them acquire what they seek. Aiding them can be risky, but ultimately it will be worth your while to have these erudite people on your side.

Where Kings Lie
If you follow the Golden Road from the city and up into the mountains to the west, you’ll eventually reach Atal’Dazar. These ancient pyramids have served as the resting place for Zandalari kings for millennia. With each passing ruler, new rooms are constructed to house the deceased’s vast wealth.


https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/may/thumb/zulda6.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/may/zulda6.jpg 


Atal’Dazar serves as the staging grounds for two new dungeons: Atal’Dazar exterior and King’s Rest interior.

A vast coastline surrounds Zuldazar to the south, east, and west, offering bountiful opportunities for fishing, boating, swimming, and treasure hunting. To the north, the marshland of Nazmir awaits exploration, offering plenty of opportunities to earn your way into the good graces of the Zandalari.


Angels Fly at MDI's European Regional
Week 3 of the MDI European Regional Group Stage kicked off with an immediate upset when the eighth seed, Games Revolted, knocked off the number one seed, Method in the first series of the tournament. This left Method with a tough path through the lower bracket for a chance at the regional final, and a seat at the live event on June 22. An improbable feat for any team, even one as talented as Method.


https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/may/thumb/MDI01.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/may/MDI01.jpg 

Practice makes perfect
Competition in Europe was very strong. Several matches came down to just a few seconds between team finishes, with some relying on the death deficit to decide the outcome. Sixth seed, Kjell’s Angels, managed to take out third seed Raider.io in the first round; first by mere seconds in Maw of Souls and again in Vault of the Wardens to take the series. Later Kjell ’s knocked out second seed Infinite in a reverse sweep by a 2-second margin in Lower Karazhan, despite Infinite’s 15-second death deficit. Finally, Kjell’s Angels crushed Method’s last chance at the Europe finals with surgical precision in Vault, the same map where they would go on to defeat Team Pogchamp for the tournament championship.

Sacrificing precision for speed
Seat of the Triumvirate is easily the most challenging dungeon in the MDI, filled with tightly placed trash packs that pose the threat of pulling more than intended and unforgiving boss mechanics. In the China regionals, Skyline.D showed us that even though clean pulls and nearly flawless Seat runs are possible, it comes at the expense of time. Skyline.D and Kjell’s Angels’s death counts were similar, but Kjell’s managed to shave off more than ten minutes from their run.

Sizing up the Composition
Despite the peculiar compositions seen during the time trials, we expected the EU teams to bring traditional compositions, based on the first two regional events. Fatsharkyes and Method threw curveballs during their Upper Karazhan match by opting not to bring healers. Method deviated further from tradition by bringing an extra tank in the healer’s place. Unlike team No Healer from China, both teams had Paladins that switched to their healing spec for the remaining matches in the series. Method played this dungeon pristinely, but their damage output was considerably lower than that of Fatsharkyes, which ultimately cost them the match by four seconds.
