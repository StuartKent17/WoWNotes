The hot fix has now been properly pushed.<br>
<br>
Remember yesterday&apos;s hotfix concerning the [item=24053,wh] pattern in Halaa ... Well, it doesn&apos;t work. (At least on european servers)<br>
<br>
Ok, looks like the hot fix didn&apos;t take, we&apos;re looking into what happened. As soon as I get some more information I will let you know.<br>
