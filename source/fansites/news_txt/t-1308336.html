<br>
You no longer have to log in to WoW, SC2, or D3, as clicking play will automatically log you in. <br>
A list of your BattleTag and RealID friends is now shown in a small window in the client.<br>
Chat is disabled for this phase of testing, but you will be able to chat with your BattleTag and RealID friends in the future.<br>

Battle.net Launcher Update: Testers Wanted<br>
We&apos;re continuing the Battle.net&#xAE;-related testing we mentioned previously (http://us.battle.net/d3/en/blog/7924401). As part of this, we&apos;re now inviting beta testers to help test and refine a new desktop app for Battle.net designed to improve the launcher experience for all Blizzard games and streamline the ability for players to get into their games.<br>
<br>
If you&#x2019;d like to help us with the testing, head to your Battle.net Beta Profile (https://us.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html) and opt in to at least one of the game universe beta tests (if you haven&#x2019;t done so already). We&#x2019;ll be inviting players to the beta test in waves&#x2014;if you&#x2019;re selected, your Battle.net account will be flagged automatically and you&#x2019;ll receive an email with additional details.<br>
<br>
For more information, check out the FAQ (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/battlenet-desktop-app-faq) or visit the beta test forums (http://us.battle.net/en/forum/).<br>

Launcher Update Testing FAQ<br>
When does the beta test begin? How do I opt-in?<br>
The beta test is now underway. If you&#x2019;d like a chance to participate, first make sure you&#x2019;ve created a BattleTag, and then head to your Beta Profile Settings and opt in to any of the Warcraft, StarCraft, or Diablo beta tests. See the Beta Opt-In Instructions for a helpful walkthrough. If you have already opted in for a previous Blizzard beta, you don&#x2019;t need to opt in a second time.<br>
<br>
What platforms and languages are supported?<br>
The Battle.net desktop application is available for Windows and Mac in English, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Russian, Polish, traditional Chinese, and Korean.<br>
<br>
What regions can participate?<br>
Players in the Americas and Oceania, Europe, Korea, and Taiwan can participate. Players in mainland China will not be able to participate in this beta test. We&#x2019;ll have more information to share about our plans for the Battle.net desktop app in mainland China in the future.<br>
<br>
Is there a non-disclosure agreement?<br>
There is not a nondisclosure agreement for this beta test. Those invited to play are free to take screenshots and discuss the app. Participants can give us feedback in the beta test forums.<br>
<br>
How does game patching work through the Battle.net desktop app?<br>
When you&#x2019;re logged in to the Battle.net desktop app, it automatically downloads and installs updates for all supported games as they become available. You can patch one game at a time; the Battle.net desktop app also allows you to pause the patching process for one game in order to patch another, if needed.<br>
<br>
Which Blizzard games are supported in the Battle.net desktop app?<br>
The Battle.net desktop app allows you to launch Diablo III, StarCraft II, and World of Warcraft. Classic Blizzard games such as Diablo II, StarCraft, and Warcraft III are not currently supported, though we&#x2019;re looking into the possibility of adding support for these games in the future.<br>
<br>
I want to use the game-specific launcher for one of my games. How do I do that?<br>
During the beta, you can switch to the previous launcher by uninstalling the Battle.net desktop app. As long as the Battle.net desktop app is installed on your system, you will not be able to access World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, or Diablo III through their standard launchers.<br>
<br>
Can I log in to the Battle.net desktop app on multiple computers?<br>
Yes, although the original login will expire if your account is logged in from another computer.<br>
<br>
Can I still access the Battle.net website in my browser?<br>
Yes, the Battle.net website will stay the same. The Battle.net desktop app provides a quick, convenient way to access your Blizzard games and certain features of Battle.net account management without opening a web browser.<br>
<br>
Will everyone&#x2019;s launchers eventually be updated to the Battle.net desktop app?<br>
Yes &#x2014; in the future, every Blizzard gamer will need to use the Battle.net desktop app to play their favorite Blizzard games. The Battle.net desktop app will replace the individual game launchers for World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, and Diablo III, and will act as your gateway to accessing future Blizzard games.<br>
<br>
We&#x2019;ll let players know in advance when we plan to roll the app out to everyone.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m having an issue&#x2014;how can I get help?<br>
Check the Known Issues List or visit the Battle.net desktop app beta forums to see if your issue is mentioned there. During the beta test, if you&#x2019;re unable to resolve the issue and it&#x2019;s preventing you from accessing your games, you can uninstall the beta client at any time to go back to using a game&#x2019;s standard launcher.</div></div>
