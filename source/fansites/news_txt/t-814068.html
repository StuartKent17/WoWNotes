Cataclysm Hotfixes - Updated Dec. 16<br>
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. While many have already been deployed on all realms, some may not be implemented until the next time your realm is restarted. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.<br>

<br>
It is no longer possible to waste a Soulstone by attempting to use it on a dead target. The player will receive an Invalid Target error message at the completion of their channel.

Cataclysm 10-Day Trial Edition Now Available<br>
If you or a friend are currently playing Wrath of the Lich King and haven&#x2019;t yet experienced the content Cataclysm has to offer, you can sign up now (http://us.battle.net/en/info/cataclysm-trial) to play a 10-day free trial version of this latest expansion for World of Warcraft.<br>
<br>
During your free trial, you&apos;ll undertake epic new quests, explore the reshaped and newly discovered lands of Azeroth, and see the world from a whole new perspective as one of the shape-changing worgen or crafty goblins.<br>
<br>
To participate, you&#x2019;ll need full versions of World of Warcraft and the first two expansions, The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King. Note that a character of at least level 78 is required to explore the new, high-level zones. More information on the 10-day free trial is available in our FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article/wowcatatrialfaq). We look forward to seeing you in the new Azeroth!<br>

In-progress dungeons<br>
If you choose specific dungeons instead of the Random Dungeon option, you should never get an in-progress dungeon. We understand you may be looking for a specific dungeon boss because of a loot drop, achievement, etc., so it may be in your best interest to queue for that particular dungeon if this is the case.<br>
<br>
We don&apos;t want to make it too easy for players to skip over in-progress dungeons. What would happen is a Dungeon Finder group would virtually always be abandoned as soon as anyone leaves the group.<br>
<br>
Also, I think right now you&apos;re seeing more in-progress dungeons pop because, in general, the dungeons are more challenging now than they were when the Looking For Dungeon feature was first introduced in Wrath of the Lich King. Some players may get frustrated and bail at the first sign of trouble, instead of realizing that everyone may have to work a little harder than they&apos;re used to in order to conquer a dungeon.
