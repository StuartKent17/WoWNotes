Missing Hotfixes<br>
Not to worry!<br>
<br>
Several changes that were made in the Tides of Vengeance update in December got misplaced with today&#x2019;s update. We&#x2019;re working on a hotfix that will carry them back into the live game. This includes a damage increase for Marksmanship Hunters, as well as Equipoise and Replicating Shadows.

Action Bar Paging Change<br>
The Key Bindings for selecting a specific action bar page (shift+1-6), paging forward (shift+mousewheel up), and paging backward (shift+mousewheel down) have been reset. These can be re-bound in the Action Bar section of the Key Bindings menu.
