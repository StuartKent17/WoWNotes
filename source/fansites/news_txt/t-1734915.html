Spirit Trinkets Buff<br>
Yep, you would think after almost 30 pages of discussion on this earlier in the week they would have listened to what was being said... I don&apos;t think more spirit was ever suggested to make the stat more desirable for healers.<br>
That&apos;s not something that can be fixed with a numbers buff to two trinkets. This change was to address that the two trinkets in question were under budget relative to other trinkets. That&apos;s all.<br>
<br>
Just to help clarify, on top of what Rygarius said: These changes were made because the items were under budget and not giving the appropriate amount of stats for their item level. There was a bug, so we fixed it.<br>
<br>
This was not a change made to make healers more interested in Spirit trinkets. We recognize that Spirit isn&apos;t the most appealing stat for healers at the moment, and are discussing how we want to handle that, but that&apos;s a separate issue than the one that prompted the changes to these trinkets.
