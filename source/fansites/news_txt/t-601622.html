USK.de (http://www.usk.de/65_Aktuell_geprueft.htm) removed their entry concerning WotLK ... I don&apos;t really see why now that it&apos;s linked everywhere and made public on other sites like gamespot, but why not. <br>
<br>
L70ETC<br>
L70ETC are now performing in game, you can find them just outside Shattrath each hour. <br>
Check the video here (http://www.youtube.com/v/ISA_nG5smy0)<br>
<br>
Hint : If you just want to listen at the song, type /script PlaySoundFile(&quot;Sound\\Music\\ZoneMusic\\DMF_L70ETC01.mp3&quot;) in game. <br>

Emerald Dream<br>
Even if pretty much anyone on earth know that Northrend will be part of the expansion, I&apos;m still not sure if the Emerald Dream will be here. Theorically we could use the 4 portals in Azeroth to access Northrend through the Emerald Dream, technically the Crystalsong Forest (http://www.wowwiki.com/Crystalsong_Forest) could be the starting zone in Northrend. <br>
<br>
The Emerald Dream is pretty big though, and I don&apos;t really see why Blizzard would use it as a simple transition zone, maybe they&apos;re just planning to release an uber-big expansion. <br>
<br>
I&apos;m posting this because while I was going through the 2.2 PTR Patch MPQ files, I noticed that two textures from the Emerald Dream was updated in this patch. <br>

Expansion<br>
While we wait for the Blizzcon, I&apos;ll post a few expansions informations depending of the mood. I&apos;ll add a probability % to each, they&apos;re not 100% accurate but they should be decently reliable.<br>
Level cap should be 80, not 75. (90% Sure)</div></div>
