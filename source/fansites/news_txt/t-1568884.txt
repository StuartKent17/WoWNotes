Warlords of Draenor - Garrison Stables
One of the buildings you can put on a large plot in your garrison is the Stables http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/65-stables#related:buildings. The stables will show off mounts that you have set as favorite mounts, allowing them to wander around to different stacks of hay.

There are five other buildings http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/65-stables#related:same-plot that can go in large plots, with a total of two plots available at garrison level 3. As with every other building, there are three building tiers, which give these bonuses: 


Tier 1 - Enables the capture and training of special mounts on Draenor.
Tier 2 - You may remain mounted while interacting with objects in outdoor Draenor zones.
Tier 3 - Increases mount speed in Draenor by 20%.
