News travels fast! We were hoping to have the time to put together a proper announcement about this, but it appears word is already out, so we wanted to acknowledge it: now that IGE is out of the picture, Wowhead has decided to become a part of the ZAM Network. We'll post a lot more information later today. Stay tuned!

It's everywhere on the interweb, Affinity Media was owned by IGE at some point, and they're the one who bought Allakhazam not sure about Thottbot. But according to this interview on Gamasutra http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14235 they're not affiliated with IGE anymore.


I work for the ZAM Network. at www.zam.com. We own Thottbot, Allakhazam, MMOInterface including wowinterface.com and Ogaming. We were, at one time, owned by the same company that owned IGE. That company recently sold IGE to a private investor. Presumably they realized that the content sites like Thott and Alla were a more profitable business than IGE--I'm not sure, I'm pretty low on the totem pole. But being connected to IGE was hurting us, and they decided they wanted to invest in us rather than in the secondary market.

I talked a little with Skosiris Wowhead developper, and he confirmed that Affinity Media doesn't have any link with IGE now. 
If the rumors are true, I'm sure that tons of people will be happy to go through all the business informations to prove that. 

Update : Almost forgot to mention, as of today, the current team should still be in charge of the site after the sale. You shouldn't have to worry about updates. ^^
