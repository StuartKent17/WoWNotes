Ion Hazzikostas - Warcraft Lore Interview
Gameinformer had the opportunity to talk to Ion Hazzikostas  recently about how Blizzard maintains the Warcraft lore.


The Loremasters at Blizzard take care of research requests, review publications and lore content for publishing teams, host lore seminars, and participate in story rooms and creative sessions.
The team has a language and pronunciation database for specific phrases and terms.
During Wrath of the Lich King development, one of the writers asked how to pronounce "Ak’agthshi ma uhnish, ak’uq shg’cul vwahuhn".
It would have made sense for Krasus to be there for the Sinestra fight, but he had already died in a book, so the team had to come up with a new Red Dragon.
Sometimes the team revises history, but only very sparingly and only as a last resort.
Khadgar was much younger in the Warcraft movie than the team had imagined him being at that time. In The Burning Crusade he was much older and had a long grey beard, so the team went back and made a younger Khadgar model.
Continuity exists to enhance a story, not to tie the hands of creators.
