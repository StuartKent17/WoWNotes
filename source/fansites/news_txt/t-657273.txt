PTR Raid and Dungeon Testing July 16
Here's the current schedule for Trial of the Crusader PTR testing:

On all realms:

The Trial of the Champion dungeon will be available shortly after the PTR coming up.

On the North American test realms:

[b] Lord Jaraxxus - Thursday Night, July 16, starting at 7pm EDT. Normal Only.
Northrend Beasts - Friday Night, July 17, starting at 7pm EDT. Normal and Heroic.
Faction Champions - Friday Night, July 17, starting at 7pm EDT. Normal and Heroic.

On the European test realms:

Val'kyr - Friday Night, July 17, starting at 19:00 CEST. Normal and Heroic.
Lord Jaraxxus - Friday Night, July 17, starting at 19:00 CEST. Normal and Heroic.
Anub'arak - Saturday Night, July 18, starting at 19:00 CEST. Normal and Heroic.

Some of the tests will have multiple bosses and difficulties available for testing, as noted above.

Test Patchwerks Tank and DPS versions will also be available in the Argent Coliseum during similar times to other bosses. Instead of the previous tank test patchwerk that increased melee damage over time, the 3.2 tank test patchwerk will just hit VERY hard as hard as Algalon all the time to allow for more lengthy sustained tank parses. We're always interested in seeing combat logs and parses for all raid testing on the PTR, but especially test patchwerk logs. These are extremely helpful to our class team.

This schedule could change at a moment's notice due to server, bug, or patch status. I'll try to keep everyone informed as much as possible. The Trial of the Crusader and the bosses to be tested will remain also open a variable length of time. How long they stay open depends upon a host of factors including designer availability, bug status, etc. These bosses are very much a work in progress, and this is a test server.


Quick Trial of the Crusader FAQ:
Q Where's all the trash?
A There isn't any in this raid zone. Really.

Q Where's the loot?
A Loot is present on the bosses, but note that many of the items do not have final art.

Q What about achievements?
A Most all of them are implemented now.
