Mob Tagging Rules and Gameplay<br>
There&apos;s no question that when spawning or quest objectives are not handled properly on our side, the tap system can create negative and anti-social experiences, wherein seeing players of your own faction nearby becomes a nuisance. We very much want to limit and rectify those situations. The most helpful thing you can do in that regard during beta is to bring to our attention specific quests or areas in which you felt competition for spawns was overly detrimental to your experience. We have a number of ways of fixing those problems, ranging from simply adding additional spawns, to dynamic spawn thresholds that ramp up density as player density increases, to making specific targets open tap.<br>
<br>
The main reason we don&apos;t embrace a fully open-tap world is that we feel that those mechanics are asocial. To be fair, that is certainly better than antisocial - no question there, and antisocial experiences usually reflect spawning and mechanics that we need to adjust. However, while a world in which everyone runs around damaging things a few times (or however much is needed to qualify for credit) may be one in which you don&apos;t feel bad about other players being around, at some point it also makes those players nearly indistinguishable from NPCs or bots with decent AI. You don&apos;t need to talk, or ask if someone has room in their group or would like to join yours. You just attack a few times, and then move on. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, mob tagging rules inherently reward and encourage social gameplay. Even in solo areas like daily quest hubs in Mists, we&apos;d commonly see transient pickup groups form for the sake of efficiency, and stick together through that hub or maybe even another (&quot;hey, anyone up for Klaxxi after this?&quot;). But once again, it&apos;s incumbent upon us to make sure that we avoid situations where that is outweighed by negatives like competing for underspawned quest targets or objects.<br>
<br>
Philosophically, for a while now, we&apos;ve made sure that any time multiple players are sent to kill a single specific target that has a respawn timer (be it named quest boss, world boss, or an event like the Battlefield: Barrens commanders in patch 5.3), the mob is open to credit for all. We&apos;re certainly open to extending that treatment where it makes sense, and where it serves to improve the overall experience. But I wouldn&apos;t expect a wholesale overhaul of our tap mechanics in the near future. <br>

Warlords of Draenor Theorycraft Discussion<br>
My theory is that for each target in the area of effect of these spells, the healing done to each target is equal to the base healing on 1-6 targets, multiplied by 6, and then divided by the number of targets within some clump check (I don&apos;t have an idea of how it does this.) This is consistent with what I saw before (in case 3 above, some dummies treated me as part of their clump number, and some didn&apos;t.)<br>
Warning, super techy theorycrafting incoming. You do *not* need to understand any of this to use these spells effectively. This info is primarily for theorycrafters.<br>
<br>
Yes. This is something we&apos;ve mentioned a few times, but I don&apos;t know if has ever been fully detailed. Traditional AoE capping works by counting the number of targets hit, and dividing the capped damage amongst them. However, there are four spells for whom that logic does not work: Chi Burst, Chi Torpedo, Divine Star, Halo.<br>
<br>
They all heal targets in an area, but that area moves (usually quite quickly, but still). If I launch a Chi Burst down a line of targets, it doesn&apos;t preemptively figure out which targets it&apos;s going to hit at cast time or anything. It just launches the orb, and there is collision detection that on it that will heal each target that it collides with. That means that when the first target gets hit, none of the other targets have been hit yet, so there&apos;s no other hits to help determine how much damage/healing it should do.<br>
<br>
So, we have a different solution for these spells. They build a list at cast time of all potential targets, and a count of how many other potential targets are near each one of those targets. That count is used for the AoE capping logic.<br>
<br>
Chi Burst: Potential targets are all targets within 60yd. Clump radius is 10yd.<br>
Chi Torpedo: Potential targets are all targets within 40yd*. Clump radius is 10yd. (*was 25yd, should be *40yd in next build)<br>
Divine Star: Potential targets are all targets within 40yd. Clump radius is 18yd.<br>
Halo: Potential targets are all targets within 40yd. Clump radius is 30yd.<br>
<br>
This works, but has some downsides of gamability, and potentially AoE capping more than needed. Example: Have a clump of a dozen players. Throw a Chi Burst but mis-aim it so it only grazes a single person in the clump. It&apos;ll apply the full AoE capping in that case, even though it only healed one target.<br>
<br>
Just did a tuning pass on weapon enchants, and here are what they&apos;ll do in the next build. (See Blue Tracker for full list (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/318876-warlords-of-draenor-theorycraft-discussion/#post442))<br>
<br>
-The other day I soloed ICC and ULD with my 90 premade toons for fun, and realized that all of my damage jumped by 100-120 times, while the formula you gave before showed 16.5 as the maximum multiplier. That&apos;s where I started guessing about a new formula implemented. Testing in Firelands showed a multiplier around 30 and considering that the mob was squished to 25%, it&apos;s about the same 100-120 multiplier in total.<br>
Looks like we changed the formula to make it scale much more. I&apos;ll get new formulae for you soon.<br>
<br>
1) Darkmoon cards seem very week (620 only) compared to heroic high maul gear (655), even weaker than 5h (630 and rarely 645). What&apos;s the reason behind that?<br>
2) Why do devs decide to use 15 as the new tier difference, instead of 13 which has been used for such a long time?<br>
3) I could see 620 and 660 pvp gears (while in pvp they&apos;re 675 and 690). Are those the final versions of pvp gear progression in 6.0? If so, then that big gap is really causing some issue imo and 660 pvp gear is again &quot;necessary&quot; for pve progression now that the only better stuff than 660 is tier-2 raid gear.<br>
1) Darkmoon cards are upgradable.<br>
2) To create more differentiation and allow more gradiation within a tier.<br>
3) The very top end of PvP gear is good, but not great, for PvE. That does not make it necessary for PvE.<br>
<br>
This isn&apos;t really theorycraft, so please start a new thread to discuss that further. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/318876-warlords-of-draenor-theorycraft-discussion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13087818929?page=24#476))<br>

Garrison Resource Cap<br>
Just to be clear. The resource cap is a holding cap, not a weekly earning cap. There are no limits (currently) on how many resources per week you are able to earn, just that you can walk around with a maximum of 1000 on your character at any given time.<br>
<br>
We are working on more cool things to spend resources on. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/328437-garrison-resource-cap-comments-blue/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13594639905?page=1#6))<br>

Racials<br>
racials in WoD favour alliance heavily. Surely you should aim for parity rather than using them as a social engineering tool?<br>
Everything we&apos;re seeing suggests that there previously was a favor toward Horde, and now there is parity. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491623962187546624))<br>
If have any data to suggest otherwise, we&apos;d love to evaluate it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491624330204151809))<br>
<br>
Classes<br>
just curious are the class mechanics close to being worked out at this point?<br>
Close, but not all done. Still several things on our list, design-wise. Then tuning, which may involve a few more design changes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491362312054243328))<br>
<br>
Many classes have spec specific lvl100 talents, many also do not, any chance at adding spec-specific talents to boost flavor?<br>
It&apos;s an option in our toolbox, but not always required in order to create an interesting choice. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491633154168348672))<br>
<br>
Is the intent still to make all three talents in a tier competitive, or are you okay with just two? 1/2<br>
Yes, all 3 talents should be competitive, though some may be more niche than others. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491632465765621761))<br>
What is different between &quot;niche&quot; and &quot;used only in very specific circumstances that occur only 1 fight/tier&quot;?<br>
That&apos;s just a matter of extremes; of just *how* niche something is. What&apos;s the concern? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491713641054339072))<br>

I don&apos;t get what your problem is . Nerf the dmg but increase the energy regen. Win Win, same dmg and always stuff to press.<br>
The problem is that Windwalker is an energy based spec, and many people are forgetting the impact of that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491022588215189504))<br>
Making an energy based spec that&apos;s not limited by energy... Is simply not something we&apos;re going to do. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491022899826794496))<br>
Devil&apos;s advocate - What about Mana based specs that aren&apos;t limited by Mana? Why have a Mana bar in the first place?<br>
They&apos;re limited by some other resource (sometimes that&apos;s Time), and are designed around that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491024664114626561))<br>
So you may as well axe some specs Mana bars, no? Or is this intended to be flavour? An homage to when it did matter?<br>
Somewhat flavor. It&apos;s a very fair criticism that most DPS with mana bars don&apos;t use mana as their primary resource. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491028720589606912))<br>
In these cases, Mana is functionally a tertiary resource, used for offheals/utility. Presentation as primary is misleading. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491029078745415681))<br>
<br>
any thought about monks changing their celestial guardian depending on what stance they are in, so brew get the ox not xuen?<br>
It&apos;s something we&apos;d like to do, but would be mostly just a cosmetic change, so is low on our priority list at the moment. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491432871312113664))<br>

Is Warlock T100 designed to allow you to choose between Infernal &amp; Doomguard by personal pref, or are they still split AoE / ST?<br>

Why the Soul Shard cost to Soul Swap? Adds a global to each target i need to DoT. VERY costly in PvP.<br>
A global? Should be a shard cost, not a GCD cost. Soulburn isn&apos;t on the GCD. But intended to be high cost. Want Warlocks... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491440375735648256))<br>
...to actually cast their DoTs most of the time. SB:SS should be a niche tool, not the main source of DoT applications. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491440468631121921))<br>

3 Raging Blows = 12 second CS window, correct?<br>
If those RBs are within the CS, yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491722836101189633))<br>
What about Enrage extention? Enrage already falls off before CS less reliable crit now, just going to BT more in CS<br>
Yes, as you absolutely should. It significantly changes your in-CS gameplay. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491723911281655808))<br>
Yes will have to play with it more. Just seems like we will spend all the extra CS hitting BT again for Enrage.<br>
1 extra BT within the CS is not &quot;all the extra CS&quot;. Big difference. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491725029831241729))<br>
<br>
Think we could shift some of the rage gen away from crit? This helps a lot but even having crit be +50% instead of +100%...<br>
That&apos;s also on our list in case we need to tune up or down the value of crit, but will happen in tuning. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491725701569990656))<br>

Warlords of Draenor Stats<br>
however dots do multistrike yes?<br>
The *damage* from DoTs will multistrike. The DoT itself doesn&apos;t apply two debuffs. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491633556527915010))<br>
<br>
I think it gets confusing on the few abilities that have multiple hits. Penance, Missiles, etc. AoE/Dots trigger per tick?<br>
Each Penance missile, or each Arcane Missile, can multistrike. AoEs can deal multistrike damage to each target individually. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491633800623837184))<br>
<br>
I ultimately don&apos;t understand how in the end it is any different than a crit. It&apos;s just a chance of increased damage.<br>
Similar in that it gives you additional damage, but it does so in a different way, with a different feeling, and implication (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491633965501931520))<br>
<br>
can the damage resulting from multistrike crit?<br>
Yes, but a multistrike&apos;s damage is not dependant on the damage that triggered it; it&apos;s a separate damage roll. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491635583165280257))<br>
<br>
This brings the question: Will resource generators multistriking generate more resources or will it just copy the damage?<br>
Just the damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491634606584889345))<br>
<br>
General answer to all &quot;Does this Multistrike?&quot; questions:Everything benefits *once* from Multistrike. No doubledipping, or zerodipping. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491631565311442945))<br>
Does that include taunts? :P<br>
.No, debuffs/buffs don&apos;t multistrike, only damage/healing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491632814266130432))<br>
how do HoTs and Dots benefit from multistrike? Extra tick or doubled damage/healing?<br>
