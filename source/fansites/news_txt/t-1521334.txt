An Artcraft blog went up on the french official website, Blizzard posted a couple of concepts of cosmetic-only accessories for some of the classes.


These cosmetic items will probably make it into the game after the release of Warlords of Draenor. 
The concepts are for the moment Alliance-only but will be differentiated for each faction if Blizzard decides it's the best way to go. 
The could apply to every classes, for example Rogues could decide to equip cosmetic daggers or vials of poison. 
This is only a first concept and the dev team is still actively working on the idea.

The full Artcraft doesn't give much more details on when these accessories will be available, and the official blog should be available on the official site shortly.
