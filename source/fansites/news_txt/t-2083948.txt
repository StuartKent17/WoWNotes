d00mgiv3r found http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2059751-Death-Knight-Artifact-Weapon-Skins-How-to-get-them-READ-OP?p=42639796&viewfull=1#post42639796 the Unholy Hidden Artifact earlier tonight, but the trigger to obtaining it isn't yet clear. 


Artifact Knowledge 6 was obtained by d00mgiv3r.
Something triggered Putricide's Journal Area Trigger http://www.wowdb.com/spells/221195-putricides-journal-area-trigger and caused Professor Putricide's Lost Journal to spawn during a fight with the second boss in Court of Stars, but this may be unrelated. 
The book allows you to see a trap door in Professor Putricide http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/36678-professor-putricide's room in Icecrown Citadel.
In the hidden chamber is the Stitchwork that drops The Bonereaper's Hook http://www.wowdb.com/items/139548-the-bonereapers-hook
There is a hidden tracking achievement that may be releated: Hidden Tracking - Apocalypse Ghouls Summoned - Number of Ghouls Summoned by Unholy DK Artifact
Research is ongoing in the thread on the forums http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2059751-Death-Knight-Artifact-Weapon-Skins-How-to-get-them-READ-OP/page251?p=42639796#post42639796.

Shield Slam now generates 20 Rage was 10.
Ignore Pain’s maximum absorption has been reduced by 33%.
Inspiring Presence no longer stacks on players who have multiple Warriors present.



Dungeons and Raids
All dungeon and raid hotfixes will take effect with realm restarts in each region.


Black Rook Hold

Mythic Keystone target time increased to 38 minutes was 35 minutes.

Eye of Azshara

Mythic Keystone target time decreased to 35 minutes was 36 minutes.

Maw of Souls

Mythic Keystone target time decreased to 24 minutes was 25 minutes.

Neltharion’s Lair

Mythic Keystone target time decreased to 33 minutes was 35 minutes.

Emerald Nightmare

Vantus Runes can now be used in Mythic Emerald Nightmare.



Il’gynoth

On Mythic difficulty, Il’gynoth’s health has been increased by 200%, but loses one-third of that value each time the Eye of Il’gynoth is defeated.
On Mythic difficulty, each Nightmare Explosion now deals 20% more damage to the Eye of Il’gynoth.

Developers’ Notes: A common strategy for Mythic Il’gynoth involved using raid compositions that focus on maximizing burst damage to complete the encounter in a single phase. This approach removes huge portions of the encounter and can overly favor a specific set of classes and specializations, causing negative social pressures in groups that have yet to reach this encounter. These changes ensure that raid groups must enter Il’gynoth’s core twice in order to complete the encounter on Mythic difficulty, but offset that change by speeding up the process of destroying the Eye to shorten the overall length of the encounter.



Professions

Enchanting

Crafted items that upgrade to epic quality should now disenchant into Leylight Shards or Chaos Crystals.



PvP

Shaman Totems will no longer take unintended extra damage from players.


Quests

Players are now able to turn in "Ritual Ruination" to Calydus in Dreadscar Rift if they don’t take the portal out of the scenario.

Legion Flying
Will the ability to fly in Legion be gated behind organized raids? As you need them for Pathfinder?
Definitely not. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/781186042686763008
