PvE
Whose idea was it to remove "Random Normals" at max level?, and could you fire them?
Not many players ran them. Most jumped into heroics as soon as they could. Why did you like them? Gearing up for heroic? Source 

LFR loot system is beyond terrible.Such a way extending content artificially by making no loot to drop.Pathetic..Just pathetic
The drop rate is the same as it was in 4.3. Just a different mechanic. Gearing is intended to take some time and effort. Source 

Suggestion: For raid lockouts, just lock out rolls for loot, let people run as many raids as they want otherwise.
Here's our concern: "Main tank, I know you won't get loot but can you run the raid with us for the third time this week?" Source 

Do the devs think all offtanks really want to dps? I die a little inside with every new 1 tank fight.
We offer mostly 2 tank fights, but with so many bosses in the game, it's going to get repetitive if they all must be. Source 

Is the plan in Mists to have raiders go through each raid and let the new ones pile up or use LFR to leapfrog tiers?
Want to err on the side of the former. If you want to do 5.2 raid, you can gear up in 5.0 LFR. Source 

Any thoughts to being able to pass the ability to receive loot in LFR if you don't want/need to give others a chance at a roll
That gets around the point of it being personal. Now players could beg you again. Begging was super awkward. Source 

Are you happy with tank balance in challenge modes? Most groups seem to strongly prefer a DK tank.
Death Grip is really good. Shockwave is too though. Source 

any reason why every weapon in terrace but Regail's Crackling Dagger  is sha touched? 
The dagger is intended to be hard to get. Source 

Do you think shamans could get CD reset on reincarnation on raid wipes? Or at least shorter cd? QoL changes? :P
Not sure we like the idea of shaman being able to die on every single attempt. Source 

In ramping up the difficulty on 10N, you now have some guilds used to clearing it for 4 years that now can't. That is not fun.
You're saying that the current raid tier feels too hard on 10 normal? What bosses are problematic for your group? Source 

PvP
Alliance get 25% buff when they control the tower in dominance offensive, but horde only get 1%. It is ridiculous.
That is based on the H:A ratio of your particular server. Source 

on a general note if you can`t burst down a healer and you can`t oom a healer what are you supposed to do?
You should be able to oom a healer. Our plan remains to nerf PvP healing once we feel like burst is solved. Source 

I hope you arent planning on leaving war/mage nerfs till 5.2 after hotfixing demo... would be incredibly annoying
We are concerned that trinket nerfs were not sufficient in curbing mage and warrior burst. Discussing options. Source 
The nerf to PvP trinkets was pointless. You just nerfed those that didn't need it and kept burst still OP for those who did.
A trinket with 5000 stats can be 20% dps during the window. That is probably too high for anyone. Source 
This was quiet dumb, 10% cooldown? Lets just go get a pve trinket. Also, you only shaved 2 - 3k off damage that still globals.
You lose a lot of PvP Power 5% DPS maybe to get the PvE trinkets, but we will take steps if those show up in PvP a lot. Source 

Just your fault for genius scaling. Why would you grants stats still anyway? Whats pvp power for?
PvP trinks designed years ago back when 1-2 classes had timers. Now everyone does. Burst trinkets are fine. Numbers just too high Source 
Doesn't make sense, fine but "to high". Fine is how they were before. Just admit you didnt want to effect pve.
The concept of clicky trinkets in PvP is fine. The tuning of PvP trinkets giving 5000 stats is not. Source 

Seeing mixed feedback about whether all PvP damage is too high or just a few overpowered spec or abilities still. Discuss if interested. Source 
I'm not sure how to fix it...but hey, I bet I could if I was getting paid for it!
Fixing it is easy. Fixing it in the right way is not. It's really unfun in our opinions when you can't kill anyone. Source 

PVP Power is only marginally better than regular main stats. Thats why it wont stop PVE trinkets in this case.
But look at the PvE trinkets. Your'e giving up passive PvP Power for expertise. Or you can have clicky secondaries. Source 

Another Xpac which Casters R extremely dominant + warriors. They hv bttr cc, surv, damage vs. dks/rogues/rets. Caster > melee
In PvP? Most complaints these days are mage and warrior. Source 

Honestly though, why do you feel like mages/locks should have both blanket+interrupt in one ability? Makes no sense at all.
Those two abilities are on our list as well. Source 
I'm getting slightly interested in that list. If you can post a blog on some primary PvP balance concerns, awesome!
Yeah, probably good water cooler fodder. I still owe y'all one on alts as well. So busy... Source 

The problem is blanket silences. With the amount of burst and silences, you die before you can cast anything.
Let's break that down more. Counterspell? Spell Lock? Silence? Anything else? Source 

i was wondering how you feel about removing Hard CC from the game completely.. Would it cause balance issues?
We think it would cause fun issues. Knowing when to use the right CC feels smart. Yes you can take it to extremes. Source 

What if CC worked so that there is a cast time for targets at range, but targets within melee brings it down to instant cast?
We'd like to shift more CCs to cast time overall. Instant anything should be rare and we've let it get too common. Source 

Don't you think removing PVP Power would address many issues players have? Like burst and huge gap in gear between players?
Players would just use the PvE weapons which have about the same DPS potential. Source 

I saw Blizzard apologise this morning. You guys need to read more ^^
Yep. I'll apologize right now that we have overpowered specs in PvP when MoP launched. Source 
Mistakes happen; but beta feedback was ignored. You're still not even acting on PvP balance concerns!
Sure we are. We nerfed Chaos Wave just the other day. Look at the 5.1 patch notes, and I'd bet most of them are PvP nerfs. Source 

Community is even making surveys for you ! Just make abilities do diff in PvP/PvE game fixed
Never understood the laser focus on this. Abilities do work differently between PvE and PvP -- just look at CC durations. Source 

Please admit removing skrimish was a mistake as well and bring it back soonish :>
I do wish we had not removed it. As I said, not many players used it, but it's clear those players miss it dearly. Source 

That's the PVE way of thinking. No serious PVPer will ever say that it should be gear=skill let alone gear>skill.
WoW is an RPG and rewards that improve your character are an RPG staple. Gear is normalized for tournaments where it makes sense. Source 

Twitter: PVP is ^%^ - No, it doesn't. Forums: <well written arguments> - no response. Seems you tweet, because you cant forum.
Not sure my posting in the forums worked. Players expected a detailed analysis of any passionate post and I don't have that time Source 

hey there you ever going to do anything about the bots in pvp. oh wait you might avoid this question or give us the usual BS
It's something we take seriously, but the solutions aren't simple. Do you have suggestions of how to catch more of them? Source 

what are your honest quick thoughts of why people think Disc pvp is weak? 
Because they see mostly Resto shaman. Source 

Upgradeable gear is okay for honor gear, but it shouldn't be for Conquest, as it'll take months to catch up. Thoughts?
Problem with catch up PvE or PvP is it encourages everyone to play less. We like playing more to feel like it's worth it. Source
