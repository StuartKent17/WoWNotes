<br>
Class Panel<br>
Dual-Spec system<br>
The dual-spec system will be introduced in a content patch. The goal is to let you switch specs very easily in raid, even between fights ! However it won&apos;t be possible to switch specs in the middle of an arena match. <br>
With dual-spec introduced in the game, there are also discussions about an Itemrack-like mod being introduced to the default UI<br>
<br>
Group Flexibility<br>
There are 30 specs but only 25 spots in a raid. The class choice should be very flexible and the buff/debuff system overhaul was done to help with that. Cancelling a buff because a class wasn&apos;t available (like Shamans for Bloodlust) was not desirable. <br>
Most buffs now affect the whole raid and multiple classes can give them, however none of them will stack. You should get more types of buffs by bringing a fewer number of players and will be able to optimize them by bringing the right spec but it definitely won&apos;t be as necessary as it was in TBC. (Note : See Raidcomp (http://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com) !)<br>
<br>
Tanking<br>
All the tanking classes are now suitable as a main tank and their threat has been greatly increased to make fights more fun, fights are now more about skills than dying because of a random aggro. <br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=650) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br>
The original idea behind the rune system was a totally customizable rune pool (like, 6 Unholy runes) but &quot;it sucked&quot;. They changed it to what is it today (2 Runes of each type)<br>
Death Knights shouldn&apos;t be played like a metronome and is intended to be an interactive and reactive class.<br>
As a death knight, your talent trees are a good way to define &quot;your style, but not your role&quot;. Devs want to bring this philosophy to other classes.<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=700) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid))<br>
Balance druids have been greatly improved and you shouldn&apos;t see a lot of OOMkins anymore. Their DPS is now on par with other DPS classes.<br>
Balance DPS looks pretty good now but developpers are keeping an eye on the survavibility<br>
Entangling roots was allowed indoor to give druids more crowd control ability in instances.<br>
Restoration were stuck in the HoT niche and were very limited in 5-mans or raids. Nourish is new flash heal-like spell added to solve this problem on single targets and Wild Growth was added to give them an AOE Heal. <br>
Druids were also given an OOC resurrection spell.<br>
Feral druids were decent at tanking and DPSing, but couldn&apos;t master any of these fields. In WotLK you can take all the bear talents to become a very good main tank, or all the cat talents to have a very high DPS. <br>
Feral mana is a known issue, and developpers don&apos;t want intellect on feral gear. This is being looked at<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=620) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter))<br>
The hunter pet system was overhauled because it was &quot;clumsy for new players&quot;.<br>
The shot rataion has been cleaned to make things easier for hunters and make them less reliant on mods or macros.<br>
Freezing shot was introduced to make pulls faster without having to deploy your traps on the ground each time. <br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=670) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?mage))<br>
Frostfire Bolt is a way to achieve an elemental tree with mages, they should be able to deal both fire and frost damage<br>
Mage DPS looks pretty good now, there are still a few mana issues getting fixed very soon<br>
Living Bomb base damage will most likely be increased and the spell mechanics might be modified slightly. Overall, the 51-points talent weren&apos;t meant to be spammed and developpers want them to be situational<br>
Frost and Fire looks pretty balanced now, but Arcane needs a few more tweaks. Arcane needs to be more &quot;mobile&quot;<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=610) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br>
Paladins were decent off-tanks but not great main tanks, this is fixed in WotLK. Paladins should focus on protection gear instead of spell power. <br>
Holy Paladins were good healers but couldn&apos;t do much in encounters where players are required to move a lot, however they definitely don&apos;t want them as a HoT class.<br>
Retribution paladins are supposed to deal a decent amount of DPS without running out of mana. <br>
Retributions paladins have to be in control of their damage and shouldn&apos;t have to rely on lucky critical strikes to deal most of their damage<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=640) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?priest))<br>
The goal with Shadowpriest is to make them a DPS class, not just a mana battery. <br>
Discipline priests should be viable raid healer.<br>
Mind sear was introduced to give priests another viable DPS ability.<br>
Class-specific racial abilities were cool, but the idea became got &quot;old&quot; with time. That&apos;s why racials have been revamped<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=630) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?rogue))<br>
AoE DPS was really needed and Fan of Knives was added to the game. <br>
Purchasable poisons and the buff of the dagger spec should help &quot;reintroducing&quot; them to the game. <br>
The goal is to have end-boss less immune to poisons and rogues less dependant of Windfury<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=660) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?shaman))<br>
Totems are now physical and harder to dispell, have more life and last longer. <br>
Hex was added to give Shamans more crowd control ability, Riptide to improve their healing, and Lava Burst their spell DPS.<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=680) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warlock))<br>
Warlocks pets have been made more useful.<br>
The warlock rotation shouldn&apos;t be restricted to a shadowbolt spam, that&apos;s why Chaos Bolt was added.<br>
Affliction Tree is still too complicated and developpers are working on it. Developers definitely want it back as a raiding spec <br>
Pets should be easier to summon/switch and use.<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=600) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warrior))<br>
Protection spec has been revamped to make it cooler to play, mitigation talents now take a lot less points and will let you invest in a few other nice tools. <br>
In TBC, Arms was PvP and Fury the PvE spec, this will change in WotLK : Battle Stance, Overpower, and Rend have been improved. New fun abilities have been introduced like Bladestorm and Sudden Death, Fury obviously have Titan&apos;s Grip.<br>
<br>

UI Panel<br>
Nothing really interesting here, but a few things answered during the Q&amp;A. If you&apos;re really interested in everything check the transcript on WoWInsider (http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/10/10/blizzcon-2008-ui-panel-liveblog/).<br>
There were plans to make the backpack bigger, but the currency and pet changes in WotLK freed enough space and there isn&apos;t any plan to do it anymore. Still possible for the future though.<br>
There is going to be a dual-spec interface introduced in a content patch after the expansion. The talent spec process will be revisited at the same time. (Confirmation boxes to prevent misplaced talents, etc ...)<br>
The compatibility of TBC addons in WotLK shouldn&apos;t be too bad at the beginning. There wasn&apos;t any huge LUA change or anything like that.<br>
There isn&apos;t any plan to add class-specific elements like PallyPower in the default UI. Sometimes very popular addons might be integrated to the base UI but only when they fit general needs. <br>
There are no current plans to change the bag UI and make it just one large bag. <br>
A /castrandom command for the new Mounts/Minipets UI might be added to the game. <br>
Itemrack and ingame boss mods are still planned, but there is no ETA on them. <br>
The current implementation of the threat UI (% of threat of the main tank) in the beta is the final one. The point of the default UI is to be simple and very visual, for more detailed stats you&apos;ll have to rely on specific mods like Omen.<br>
<br>
<br>
The pictures below are early beta of the achievement UI, and a few explanations on how things works during development. <br>
