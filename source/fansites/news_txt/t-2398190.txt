This Week in WoW History
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.

Encounter Journal
Before the release of Firelands, the Encounter Journal was added to the PTR. This tool was one of the biggest changes for the raiding scene at the time, because it introduced an in-game tool for players to read before fighting a boss. Prior to the Encounter Journal, players only had access to third party sources to get familiar with encounters. This new Journal provides information about boss abilities, loot, and model preview.

Cloud Serpents
Mists of Pandaria brought a new mount model to the game; the Cloud Serpent. These mounts became iconic for the expansion. Multiple color variations were added as rewards for various things, from quests, to reputations and rares. Some of the rare ones, such as the Onyx Cloud Serpent are still farmed today because of their rarity.

Patch 5.3: Escalation
The third content patch of Mists of Pandaria added a few Heroic Scenarios, the continuation of the Legendary Quest line, mounts, an Arena, and a Battleground. A few storyline quests were also added to further the story in the Razor Hill area. The Darkspear Rebellion faction was also added with some new item sets. The new mounts that were added include the Enchanted Fey Dragon, a store mount, the Hearthsteed, reward for playing Hearthstone, the Armored Dragonhawks, and the Brawler’s Burly Mushan Beast.

Mount Preview
The Grinning Reaver was teased on Twitter with a screenshot of the mount and the caption “IS THAT A SADDLE?”. It was later confirmed that this would become a store-mount added in Patch 5.4.8.

This animated short tells the story of two brothers, Hanzo and Genji. During his yearly visit to the Shimada Temple, Hanzo is attacked by yet another assassin. After a scene with stunning fight choreography, he learns the truth about his attacker.

Destiny 2
In 2017, Bungie announced their collaboration with Blizzard to bring Destiny 2 to Battle.net. This first-person action game was announced with the “Rally the Troops” reveal trailer. The first Destiny game was a console exclusive, which many people hoped would come to the PC. With the release of the second game, this provided a perfect opportunity to reach a different audience through their deal with Blizzard.
