Legion - Kosumoth the Hungering Rare Spawn<br>
Arcten and other players figured out how to spawn (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/51itsz/kosumoth_the_hungering_theory/) how to summon Kosumoth the Hungering (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111573-kosumoth-the-hungering)! Killing him won&apos;t do much for you unless you have the world quest, which is unlocked by completing the process below. This week the quest appears to reward Fathom Dweller (http://www.wowdb.com/items/138201-fathom-dweller) for EU and Hungering Claw (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140261-hungering-claw) for the US.<br>

http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/mvbar900.jpg<br>
<br>
<br>
Initial Steps<br>
<br>
Talk to Drak&apos;thul (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/102695-drakthul) out on the Broken Shore (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm01.jpg?1) until he has no more dialogue options for you to choose from.<br>
Head to the cave at 58, 54 on the Broken Isles, die and resurrect if needed to get past the rocks, go to the very back, click the Mound of Dirt to loot the Weathered Relic (http://www.wowdb.com/items/139783-weathered-relic). <br>
The mound is hard to see (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm02.jpg), so look carefully. <br>
Return to Drak&apos;thul and talk to him again until he has no more dialogue options for you to choose from. This requires opening and closing the dialogue window.<br>
<br>
<br>
Orb Notes<br>
<br>
Next you will need to click on ten different orbs, in order. Each has a 50 minute respawn time per realm. <br>
You can use this macro to check if you got credit for an orb: /dump IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(QuestID)<br>
The Quest ID for each orb is listed in parenthesis in the steps below.<br>
Orb 6 and 9 are bottlenecks, as they are located in a place where players from multiple realms appear. <br>
Changing zones, waiting, or logging in and out will cause the DANGER: Kosumoth the Hungering (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43798-danger-kosumoth-the-hungering) quest to appear, rewarding you with Hungering Claw (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140261-hungering-claw) or Fathom Dweller (http://www.wowdb.com/items/138201-fathom-dweller), depending on what is up for your region this week.<br>
<br>
<br>

Orb 6 (43735) - Go to 67, 15 on the Broken Isles map (near the island northeast of Stormheim), entering the cave located under the shark (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm12.jpg). This orb will have people from multiple realms.<br>
Orb 7 (43736) - Go to 55.8, 38.6 in Highmountain. You will need to drop down off the cliff (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm13.jpg) a short distance to reach this cave, which is another hidden by some bushes.<br>
Orb 8 (43737) - Go to 54.1, 26.3 in Azsuna, entering the cave at the base of a tree (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm14.jpg). The orb is towards the back of the cave under a bush (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm15.jpg).<br>

<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#U) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#VAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#U))<br>

<br>
Developers&#x2019; Notes: The two toys above (combined, or in conjunction with other things such as Emerald Winds (http://www.wowdb.com/items/139773-emerald-winds)) were too effective and diminished the value of utility and world-navigation tools that are core to certain classes and professions.<br>

Reduced the active effect potency of Heirloom trinkets acquired from Warlords of Draenor Mythic Dungeons.<br>

Legion Companion App FAQ<br>
With the release of the WoW Legion Companion App, we&#x2019;ve seen a number of questions from the community that we&#x2019;d like to address. Here are some answers to some of the most-frequently asked questions:<br>
<br>
Q: Why do I keep getting the same notifications when I close the app?<br>
A: This is a known issue, which we plan to fix in the next update to the Legion Companion App.<br>
<br>
Q: My authenticator app is on the same device as the WoW app, is there a way to avoid having to switch to the Authenticator app to approve a code while logging in?<br>
A: There are two ways to avoid this. When you get the &#x201C;Check your Authenticator for request&#x2026;&#x201D; message, do one of the following:<br>
<br>
1) Swipe down on the notification itself to reveal an &#x201C;Approve&#x201D; button. Tap that and login will continue. 2) Scroll down and tap the &#x201C;Use Authenticator Security Code&#x201D; link. This should import a code automatically from the Authenticator app if it is on the same device. Then scroll down and tap &#x201C;Submit&#x201D; to enter the code.<br>
<br>
Q: I have a character that has champions, but the app says it doesn&#x2019;t, and won&#x2019;t let me log in. What&#x2019;s going on?<br>
A: This is a known issue and a fix is being applied, but it may take a day to fully update world-wide. As a workaround, try logging in and out of the affected character on your computer before logging in on the app.<br>
<br>
Q: Why do I have to log in every time I use the app?<br>
A: You don&#x2019;t! If you are on the title screen and have previously logged in, you should see the &#x201C;Characters&#x201D; button. Tap that instead of &#x201C;Login&#x201D; and you will bypass the login step and go straight to character selection.<br>
<br>
Q: Will the Legion Companion App be released for Windows or Amazon phones?<br>
A: We are currently not planning to support any platforms other than iOS and Android at this time.<br>
<br>
