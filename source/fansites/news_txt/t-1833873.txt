Blizzard Trademarks "Compete"
Blizzard appears to have trademarked "Compete" in the US and some EU countries. The description makes it clear that it isn't related to the WoW Expansion we are all waiting for, but instead an esports tool.

Overwatch Added to the Launcher
Overwatch was added to the launcher today. You can't actually install it, so it is just an advertisement for now.

Strings Changes

ERR_BATTLEGROUND_JOIN_MERCENARY - Cannot join as a group unless all the members of your party are flagged as a mercenary.
WORLD_PVP_DESERTER - You cannot enter %s until your deserter debuff wears off.




Patch 6.2 Hotfixes - August 5
Garrison
Followers

Talonpriest Ishaal's Last Rites ability should now correctly be considered a stun effect. The effect lasts 3 seconds when used against other players, and shares diminishing returns with other stun effects.


Raids and Dungeons
Hellfire Citadel
Hellfire High Council

Dia Darkwhisper's Mark of the Necromancer now deals 20% less damage. Additionally, applications of Mark of the Necromancer can no longer be delayed.


Items

Sanctus, Sigil of the Unbroken http://www.wowdb.com/items/124637-sanctus-sigil-of-the-unbroken on-use ability has been doubled in effectiveness and now grants 50% to Versatility up from 25% on the base ring.

Last 12 hours! What's your best guess? South Seas? Trolls? Sargeras? Unnecessary spikes? Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/629140961252081664
Since you were able to say all of those things without being assassinated, it can't be any of those things.
