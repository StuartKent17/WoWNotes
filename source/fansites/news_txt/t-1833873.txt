Blizzard Trademarks "Compete"
Blizzard appears to have trademarked "Compete" in the US and some EU countries. The description makes it clear that it isn't related to the WoW Expansion we are all waiting for, but instead an esports tool. 


  


Overwatch Added to the Launcher
Overwatch was added to the launcher today. You can't actually install it, so it is just an advertisement for now.


  


Patch 6.2.1 PTR - Build 20363
Tonight's PTR build fixed a few things for mercenary mode and has been flagged as Release. We also learned that Patch 6.2.2 is coming  in the future, so flying may be on the way soon!


  

Strings Changes

ERR_BATTLEGROUND_JOIN_MERCENARY - Cannot join as a group unless all the members of your party are flagged as a mercenary.
WORLD_PVP_DESERTER - You cannot enter %s until your deserter debuff wears off.




Patch 6.2 Hotfixes - August 5

Talonpriest Ishaal's Last Rites ability should now correctly be considered a stun effect. The effect lasts 3 seconds when used against other players, and shares diminishing returns with other stun effects.


Raids and Dungeons
Hellfire Citadel
Hellfire High Council

Dia Darkwhisper's Mark of the Necromancer now deals 20% less damage. Additionally, applications of Mark of the Necromancer can no longer be delayed.


Items

Sanctus, Sigil of the Unbroken  on-use ability has been doubled in effectiveness and now grants 50% to Versatility up from 25% on the base ring.
