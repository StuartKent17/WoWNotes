The european players are getting more free character migration available to reduce the queues on overpopulated realms.<br>

<br>
From: Crushridge, Frostmane, Grim Batol, Outland<br>
To: Dentarg, Haomarush, Mazrigos<br>
<br>
Please note that the migration may be closed at any time should a destination realm&apos;s population rise too high.<br>

Rogues - Hemorrhage changes in 2.3.2<br>
I talked about this a few weeks (months?) ago during the 2.3.2 testing but it&apos;s great to have a post explaining everything for people who didn&apos;t read the original posts about this. <br>
Hemo should be doing less damage in 2.3.2 than in 2.3.0.<br>
<br>
Hemorrhage is also normalized based on weapon type and speed so the amount of damage you do with an individual attack will vary depending on the type and speed of the weapon you are using and can not be directly compared to your main hand attacks.<br>

World of Warcraft wins an Emmy Award<br>
Blizzard won an award during the 59th Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards held during the CES in Las Vegas this week under the category &quot;Development of Massively Multiplayer Online Graphical Role Playing Games&quot;. <br>
<br>
According to the Emmy Awards (http://www.emmyonline.org/mediacenter/tech_2k7_winners.html) website, 2 other games won this award : Everquest and Neverwinter Nights. I&apos;m not sure if NWN and EQ won an award for the original game, or for the follow-ups, it seems a bit late to give an award to the original Everquest game even if it definitely deserves an award.</div></div>
