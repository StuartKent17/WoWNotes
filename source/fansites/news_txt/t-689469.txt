The Crimson Halls of the Icecrown Citadel unlock this week! 

The Blood Princes http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=891 and Blood Queen Lana'thel http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=895 will be unlocked.
You will get 15 attempts to defeat the final boss of each wing Putricide / Lana'thel. So far we assume that the amount of attempts is shared between bosses. And I'm sure blue posters will clarify that a hundred of times

If you still have trouble understanding how the raid unlocks work, here is a nice flowchart! Thanks to Dorer http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Tichondrius&cn=Dorer

Changes to PPM procs
We changed the way PPM procs work to make sure many of the weapons and trinkets did their expected performance in Icecrown instead of proc'ing too much for some specs or classes or forcing players into unusual behavior to try and fish for the procs. This change also affected some older mechanics in the game too such as the Berserking enchant. For the most part the intent is that these systems all proc off of attacks and they are balanced with that assumption.

At this time we're happy with the damage that characters are now doing after these changes, though we'll continue to monitor and adjust damage overall and that includes the proc-based items. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418707360-ppm-behavior-nerf.html
