The Crimson Halls of the Icecrown Citadel unlock this week! 

The Blood Princes  and Blood Queen Lana'thel  will be unlocked.
You will get 15 attempts to defeat the final boss of each wing Putricide / Lana'thel. So far we assume that the amount of attempts is shared between bosses. And I'm sure blue posters will clarify that a hundred of times


   

If you still have trouble understanding how the raid unlocks work, here is a nice flowchart! Thanks to Dorer

Changes to PPM procs
We changed the way PPM procs work to make sure many of the weapons and trinkets did their expected performance in Icecrown instead of proc'ing too much for some specs or classes or forcing players into unusual behavior to try and fish for the procs. This change also affected some older mechanics in the game too such as the Berserking enchant. For the most part the intent is that these systems all proc off of attacks and they are balanced with that assumption.

At this time we're happy with the damage that characters are now doing after these changes, though we'll continue to monitor and adjust damage overall and that includes the proc-based items. Source 

Addons - Bejeweled and Peggle
You probably spent a lot of time waiting for an instance group since the release of Patch 3.3, it's time to mention Bejeweled and Peggle  on the front page again!

About a year ago, Popcap released a free version of their games that you can download and install like any addon, both games run smoothly and will keep you busy while you wait for an instance. Of course, I won't be responsible if you play that DURING the instance. or if you waste 2 hours on Peggle when you are supposed to write a news post for your front page <coughs>
