UPDATED JANUARY 28 18:45 PST<br>
<br>
With scheduled maintenance this week, we&#x2019;re going to make some adjustments to several specs in PvE and PvP, as well as a number of Azerite Traits. We&#x2019;re keeping a close eye on both early performance in the new raid as well as how things have been going in Mythic Keystone dungeons in Tides of Vengeance.<br>
<br>
Our usual disclaimers apply - these may still change slightly:<br>
<br>
Classes<br>

<br>
Unholy<br>
<br>
Death Coil damage increased by 20%.<br>

<br>
Restoration<br>
<br>
Efflorescence healing increased by 15%.<br>
Lifebloom and Wild Growth cost reduced by 7%.<br>

<br>
Marksmanship<br>
<br>
All damage and pet damage increased by 3%.<br>
Developers&#x2019; note: Marksmanship damage has been a bit too low when not using Unerring Vision. With the reduction to Unerring Vision&#x2019;s effectiveness, this increase brings Marksmanship up to a more appropriate overall level.<br>

<br>
Arms<br>
<br>
Mortal Strike, Execute, Slam, Overpower, and Rend damage increased by 8%.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Based on data observed since Tides of Vengeance launched, we have a number of tuning changes for Azerite traits. The goal of these changes is to improve the usability of some class traits, as well as rein in the power of some of the newer traits in a way that still preserves their core coolness. Additionally, some Azerite traits changed value dramatically with changes to specs in Tides of Vengeance, so we&#x2019;re taking this opportunity to rebalance those traits as the Mythic Raid opens.<br>
