Armory Stats - Player Achievement Points Distribution
Today we are taking a look at the achievement points distribution of Level 90 players. There are 7.6 million characters and 2.9 million accounts that make up this sample. Main character is defined as the character with the most achievement points on an account.

Warlords of Draenor Item Stats
Depends on if you are a class that benefits from all stats, some don't... and wish to reforge the bad stat.
Truly bad stats and they do exist are on us to fix. When one stat is 5% better and still considered mandatory = tough to fix. Source 
Miss a break point by few hundred haste? Stuck with wasted stats until perfectly itemized piece drops. Back to BIS lists.
"Miss a break point by a few hundred haste" and "wasted stats" implies a level of min-maxing not necessary for almost all players. Source 
Barely missing a break point? That's a rounding error for most of us overcome by better use of abilities and movement in a fight. Source 
haste breakpoints for DoTs and HoTs are important. missing by 1 point means 1 less tick, and they are noticable.
There won't be break points on hots and dots any longer. Source 
does this mean haste will increase the duration? instead of reducing time between ticks
Haste will increase the number of ticks, possibly resulting in a final fractional tick. Source 

Please keep Reforging in. Now that hit and exp are gone, I don't see the reason for it to be removed.
It would mean you still have to reforge everything to your best secondary stat according to someone's website. Source 
Reforging being gone won't stop min-max-ers to min-max their characters, at all. It will stop players defining their style. 
I find that a bit contradictory. Whose style is it to do less damage by reforging into the wrong stat? Source 
It is probably possible to get secondary stats closer, but not possible to get them all within 1% of each other in all fights Source 
Maybe they meant: "want secondary stats to affect play style, not dps". Would be cool hard as hell to do that
Yeah it's hard because there will always be a mathematically-solvable right answer for DPS. Not so for tanks and healers. Source 
We try to get around that by varying the situations a lot. Some fights need burst. Others need AE. Others need movement. Source 
My dream: lots of abilities for dps, you pick and choose what your rotation uses due to what stat you favor. works in theory?
In theory. Might mean balancing a whole lot of different potential rotations. Source 

It would mean you COULD reforge everything. You're taking AWAY choice. Now, a crappy piece of gear is a dud.
It's not really a "choice" though when the choice is play more effectively reforge or less effectively be lazy. Source 
a statment like that caterning for the people that dont give a shit about playing the game is a ..
I think you misinterpreted the statement. I was arguing reforging isn't really a choice because most players don't want to be bad. Source 
They may be bad anyway, but they likely aren't trying to be bad. Source 

Bringing back AP/SP is a bad idea. since stacking Agi/Str/Int we get even more from the 5% buff. Plz, dont hate us.
That is solveable. The idea is to make sure jewelry etc. can be shared more easily, particularly between Str and Agi users. Source 
Another idea is rings swap Str and Agi but not Int the way armor does or something similar. Source 
if I'm getting this right. There will be no primary stat on non-armor pieces?
Possibly on weapons, just because weapons are fairly iconic and don't have as much class overlaps as say rings can. Source 
Obviously, this is all stuff that's in flux as "we" work through it all. Source 

The post doesn't make this clear, but are they getting rid of Tier tokens?
We haven't decided. There is still some benefit in dropping paly-priest-warlock instead of just warlock. Source 

Tertiary Stats
New loot system will make loot distribution a PITA. I'm not looking forward to dealing with more loot related drama.
Overall we find sharing fewer items to be better for morale even if the pieces that do drop are highly coveted. Source 
I meant "Overall we find SHARDING fewer...." That changes the whole context. Source 

Think tertiary stats dramas organized raids? Chest drops, give to tank. +lifesteal chest drops, give to tank again. 1st wasted
That will happen on rare occasions. But what if a chest drops with Lifesteal but a secondary the tank doesn't like, say crit? Source 
My point is that overall the landscape will have more answers than just "Is it BiS? If not, pass." Source 

Ridiculously powerful items being very rare and random like D3, w/o the ability to grind for these as much as you want. Why?
We want the long tail to be exciting. Otherwise you earn BiS quickly and shard everything else for weeks. Source 

Why does WoD loot seem like Diablo loot system with a 1 week lockout and huge party requirement?
It's not nearly as random as Diablo. We just want to keep that 14th Immerseus kill somewhat exciting. Source 
Lots of people will not see that as something cool or amazing dropping. To them it will feel like the other drops are shit.
Then they're going to go weeks and weeks without a new item if they pass everything that isn't BiS. MC loot style wasn't that bad. Source 

If Tertiary stats aren't 'common enough to build a set around', then where's the gameplay? Who cares about +0.74% run speed.
Since we don't have to balance around the case of a run speed set, we should be able to make the effects much larger than 0.74%. Source 
Run speed might be a bit too BiS for casters as a tert. stat dont you think?
Run speed will still be pretty rare and on some fights it's totally useless. Seems like a fine position for it overall. Source 


Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud 
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud  will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
New GPUs from AMD are here, at least on paper. Finding any AMD GPUs is hard now, as is finding some of the Nvidia GPUs. Prices for many GPUs went up due to demand and the older GPUs being discontinued. 

The current SSD prices  are stable, with most SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. 

The Haswell CPUs  run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14  or H90  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions! If you are interested in Folding@home, take a look in our team's thread
