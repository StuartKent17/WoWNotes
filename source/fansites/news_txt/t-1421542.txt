Armory Stats - Player Achievement Points Distribution
Today we are taking a look at the achievement points distribution of Level 90 players. There are 7.6 million characters and 2.9 million accounts that make up this sample. Main character is defined as the character with the most achievement points on an account.

Warlords of Draenor Item Stats
Depends on if you are a class that benefits from all stats, some don't... and wish to reforge the bad stat.
Truly bad stats and they do exist are on us to fix. When one stat is 5% better and still considered mandatory = tough to fix. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407621664751378432
Miss a break point by few hundred haste? Stuck with wasted stats until perfectly itemized piece drops. Back to BIS lists.
"Miss a break point by a few hundred haste" and "wasted stats" implies a level of min-maxing not necessary for almost all players. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407927962176999424
Barely missing a break point? That's a rounding error for most of us overcome by better use of abilities and movement in a fight. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407928377341788160
haste breakpoints for DoTs and HoTs are important. missing by 1 point means 1 less tick, and they are noticable.
There won't be break points on hots and dots any longer. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408258516894240769
does this mean haste will increase the duration? instead of reducing time between ticks
Haste will increase the number of ticks, possibly resulting in a final fractional tick. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408355005985353728

Please keep Reforging in. Now that hit and exp are gone, I don't see the reason for it to be removed.
It would mean you still have to reforge everything to your best secondary stat according to someone's website. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407314304807870464
Reforging being gone won't stop min-max-ers to min-max their characters, at all. It will stop players defining their style. 
I find that a bit contradictory. Whose style is it to do less damage by reforging into the wrong stat? Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407620076800446464
It is probably possible to get secondary stats closer, but not possible to get them all within 1% of each other in all fights Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407620223030657024
Maybe they meant: "want secondary stats to affect play style, not dps". Would be cool hard as hell to do that
Yeah it's hard because there will always be a mathematically-solvable right answer for DPS. Not so for tanks and healers. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408669258873204736
We try to get around that by varying the situations a lot. Some fights need burst. Others need AE. Others need movement. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408669379098705921
My dream: lots of abilities for dps, you pick and choose what your rotation uses due to what stat you favor. works in theory?
In theory. Might mean balancing a whole lot of different potential rotations. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408752399587614720

It would mean you COULD reforge everything. You're taking AWAY choice. Now, a crappy piece of gear is a dud.
It's not really a "choice" though when the choice is play more effectively reforge or less effectively be lazy. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407322748361256962
a statment like that caterning for the people that dont give a shit about playing the game is a ..
I think you misinterpreted the statement. I was arguing reforging isn't really a choice because most players don't want to be bad. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408257505664331777
They may be bad anyway, but they likely aren't trying to be bad. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408257611872477184

Bringing back AP/SP is a bad idea. since stacking Agi/Str/Int we get even more from the 5% buff. Plz, dont hate us.
That is solveable. The idea is to make sure jewelry etc. can be shared more easily, particularly between Str and Agi users. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408665514341179392
Another idea is rings swap Str and Agi but not Int the way armor does or something similar. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408665596226592768
if I'm getting this right. There will be no primary stat on non-armor pieces?
Possibly on weapons, just because weapons are fairly iconic and don't have as much class overlaps as say rings can. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408688089448452096
Obviously, this is all stuff that's in flux as "we" work through it all. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408688154724401152

The post doesn't make this clear, but are they getting rid of Tier tokens?
We haven't decided. There is still some benefit in dropping paly-priest-warlock instead of just warlock. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405460952700559360

Tertiary Stats
New loot system will make loot distribution a PITA. I'm not looking forward to dealing with more loot related drama.
Overall we find sharing fewer items to be better for morale even if the pieces that do drop are highly coveted. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405460586936274944
I meant "Overall we find SHARDING fewer...." That changes the whole context. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405460796815065089

Think tertiary stats dramas organized raids? Chest drops, give to tank. +lifesteal chest drops, give to tank again. 1st wasted
That will happen on rare occasions. But what if a chest drops with Lifesteal but a secondary the tank doesn't like, say crit? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402649275869306880
My point is that overall the landscape will have more answers than just "Is it BiS? If not, pass." Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402649412523929600

Ridiculously powerful items being very rare and random like D3, w/o the ability to grind for these as much as you want. Why?
We want the long tail to be exciting. Otherwise you earn BiS quickly and shard everything else for weeks. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405459699119570945

Why does WoD loot seem like Diablo loot system with a 1 week lockout and huge party requirement?
It's not nearly as random as Diablo. We just want to keep that 14th Immerseus kill somewhat exciting. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405462038899470336
Lots of people will not see that as something cool or amazing dropping. To them it will feel like the other drops are shit.
Then they're going to go weeks and weeks without a new item if they pass everything that isn't BiS. MC loot style wasn't that bad. Source https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408663364684890112

If Tertiary stats aren't 'common enough to build a set around', then where's the gameplay? Who cares about +0.74% run speed.
Since we don't have to balance around the case of a run speed set, we should be able to make the effects much larger than 0.74%. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405458496230940672
Run speed might be a bit too BiS for casters as a tert. stat dont you think?
Run speed will still be pretty rare and on some fights it's totally useless. Seems like a fine position for it overall. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405464304134017025


Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
New GPUs from AMD are here, at least on paper. Finding any AMD GPUs is hard now, as is finding some of the Nvidia GPUs. Prices for many GPUs went up due to demand and the older GPUs being discontinued. 

The current SSD prices http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/december/ssdgraph.gif are stable, with most SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. 

The Haswell CPUs http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1 run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&tag=mmochamp-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A or H90 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4OCWDE?ie=UTF8&tag=mmochamp-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00B4OCWDE. 

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx and Nvidia http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us drivers up to date.
