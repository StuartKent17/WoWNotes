Devs know the bug related to Chi Burst doing no damage to enemies when in heal spec? I hope you're hotfixing that soon!
Yes. This issue appears to be applying to most moving area effects. Please know that fixing this is a top priority for us right now. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/847166402481963008

shadow fiend is not benefiting from the artifact weapon trait if glyph of the sha is applied. Can you look into this?
We're testing a hotfix for this right now. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/847166800609525760

there was a bug yesterday hotfixed now where clients weren't getting a GCD on queued spells, effectively forcing *600ms*.
So if anyone played yesterday and thought "This 400ms window feels terrible", that's a misunderstanding. Give it another try.
It was actually "600ms, plus client not showing GCDs" that felt terrible.
My suggestion:
400ms is a good default
[ping+200] ms if you time/spam presses well.
[ping+100] ms if you're always a perfect god.
Anything less than 100ms is just wasting performance, IMO.
Regardless, if you're not sure, 400ms default is fine post-hotfix Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/847211120582467584
