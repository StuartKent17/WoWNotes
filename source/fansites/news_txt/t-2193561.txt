Devs know the bug related to Chi Burst doing no damage to enemies when in heal spec? I hope you're hotfixing that soon!
Yes. This issue appears to be applying to most moving area effects. Please know that fixing this is a top priority for us right now. WarcraftDevs 

shadow fiend is not benefiting from the artifact weapon trait if glyph of the sha is applied. Can you look into this?
We're testing a hotfix for this right now. WarcraftDevs 

there was a bug yesterday hotfixed now where clients weren't getting a GCD on queued spells, effectively forcing *600ms*.
So if anyone played yesterday and thought "This 400ms window feels terrible", that's a misunderstanding. Give it another try.
It was actually "600ms, plus client not showing GCDs" that felt terrible.
My suggestion:
400ms is a good default
[ping+200] ms if you time/spam presses well.
[ping+100] ms if you're always a perfect god.
Anything less than 100ms is just wasting performance, IMO.
Regardless, if you're not sure, 400ms default is fine post-hotfix Celestalon
