Valor Point Item Upgrades
In Mists of Pandaria, Valor Points can be used to upgrade your gear. This feature is not in the game yet and not intended to be previewed at this time. All of the numbers used here are fake except the item level 375 requirement and for demonstration purposes only. 


The minimum item level to upgrade gear is 375.
The left side shows the gear item level 500 and the player's item level 489.
The right side shows the increase in item level, and the new item level 525 and player's item level 491.
Right now all stats are upgraded, you can see the increase in individual stats on the right side +35 and the new stat amount 255.
This example only shows one stat, but in the final product all of the stats on an item will be increased.
Each item has a limited number of times it can be upgraded, which is shown at the top right 2/3, with the upgrade cost directly above it 300.

South Korea Bans Botting
The South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism is preparing a new law that will outlaw virtual item trades and farming items for commercial use in games. This new law is supposed to encourage students to avoid wasting time and improve the environment of games. The law prohibits players from using software that allows characters to farm items in a game without the need for a human to be playing. 

The article in The Korea Times http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2012/06/129_112964.html doesn't make it very clear, but this ban may also impact Arcade games that sell something you have to physically go and purchase to redeem for an item in game.

The Ministry claims that the "main purpose of the games is for entertainment and should be used for academic and other good purposes", which doesn't include farming items for money! They also mentioned that virtual item trades contribute to many problems in society, including teenage crime. The police department is supposed to enforce this law which has a maximum punishment of a $43,000 USD fine and up to five years in prison.

Forced Cross Realm PVP
When we go live, cross realm zones won't put PvP and PvE realms together.

During beta testing, you're going to see a lot of crazy stuff. Please keep in mind that beta is not a demo of the game. It is a testing environment in which we can get feedback from players but also in which we can test out many of our new features, some of which, like this one, are quite technically complex. 

If you find yourself overly frustrated by the chaotic nature of beta, whether it's from cross-realm testing, broken quests or class bugs, my suggestion would be to wait until we launch. It's not worth getting frustrated over. You'll have plenty of opportunities to explore Pandaria.

Rogue Feedback
He hasn't answere anything about the Prep/Step issue. 
Again, I feel like we have made plenty of responses to the topic. I think it's one of those deals where because some players don't like the answer, they say the topic has not been addressed.

For the record, as many players will tell you, Sub is nearly impossible to balance with both Preparation and Shadowstep. On the other hand, having two talents that are both so good that you want them both and have to think long and hard about which one to take and perhaps even swap back and forth from time to time is pretty much exactly what we are trying to deliver with the new talent system. Are rogues doomed in PvP without both? I doubt that. Is it hard t o choose? Of course, and that's the point. If we conclude that it's just too cruel to ask rogues to choose between them, we'd likely just cut Prep from the game and perhaps lower a few cooldowns slightly. I really hope though that we aren't in a space where every cool talent has to become mandatory or deleted.

Leeching and paralytic locking each other out
Again, asked and answered. We said that we understand that very optimized rogues won't want both talents because you can only use one at a time. That depends a very great deal on how often you'd use the competing talents. If you find yourself using leeching poison then swapping to paralytic often, you may be better off just keeping both talents than constantly swapping. A Disc priest on live doesn't necessarily drop the Atonement talent evey time they think they might not Smite, though very min/max players probably do.

We're going to be underfunded for the first patch of MoP
Do you have any evidence of this? Even anecdotes are better than nothing though not much better. The classes on beta are getting pretty well balanced at this point at both level 85 and 90 modulo the occasional bug that creeps in, so if you think you're seeing something we're not, please let us know.

As an aside, I'm not a huge fan of simulations as evidence, because it requires us to debug them first. I used to spend more effort doing that, but it's a chore, and my time is probably better spent elsewhere. Sims are fantastic for suggesting to you that you might want to try a different rotation or stat allocation. They aren't great for "Hey Bliz, my dps is low. Please buff."

Dirty Tricks just sounds like a bug. I don't have our bug database in front of me, but it's hard to make assumptions about neglect based on when a bug gets fixed, so long as it does before launch. It could be that the developer is waiting on a code change to fix the bug. It could be that he or she is pondering how to fix it or if a redesign in the functionality not the base design is warranted.

I've been doing this a long time, and one of the truths I have uncovered is that apparently easy bugs are often the hardest to fix and things you predict would take weeks of programming time can be done in a few lines. It's hard to diagnose from the outside.

If you see bugs, report them in the bug forum. Once you have done so, stop worrying about it until we get close to launch.
