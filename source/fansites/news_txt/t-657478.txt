I like catchy titles. In the last PTR build 4 new textures of Halloween masks have been added.

2 of them are for Goblins masks - Helm_Mask_Halloween_GoF and Helm_Mask_Halloween_GoM
2 of them are for Worgens masks - Helm_Mask_Halloween_WoF and Helm_Mask_Halloween_WoM

Even if the Goblin texture would make sense as an addition to the game, adding Worgens texture out of nowhere is definitely a sign that the 2 new races of the expansion will be the Worgens most likely for the Alliance and the Goblins. 

I know that a lot of people will love to argue with that over hundreds of replies. I would just like to add that it usually takes a lot to make me post something on the front page and I don't think I've ever been wrong everytime I did. Hopefully Blizzard will react fast enough and add tons of new masks in the next build just to pretend that it was intended. Suggestion: Pandarens please

On a non related sidenote, I would also like to point out that the old Emerald Dream maps that have been in the game files for years have been slightly updated throughout the 3.2, and in the Build 10072 of the PTRs the Map.dbc file with some of the settings for each zone was updated to make it a 40 Players max zone. 


PTR Focused Testing - Northrend Beasts and Faction Champions
The Northrend Beasts Info + Loot http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=74603.0 and Faction Champions Info http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=74632.0 / Loot http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=74655.0 encounters are being test on the US Test Realms. I will not copy the skills list once again, just check the older posts.

The new items will be added to the Item Database Latest Additions Page http://db.mmo-champion.com/latest, a compilation will be available on the front page once the testing is done. 

Update - I will keep the loot tables update on the itemDB for the moment, tags have been created to make the browsing easier, most of the bosses had their loot table cleaned/updated.
