The Nighthold Updates
The uninstanced version of the Nighthold http://www.wowdb.com/zones/8025-the-nighthold has seen some changes, becoming more of a small faction hub. Both Alliance and Horde can visit as of now. There are teleport stations that lead to Dalaran http://www.wowdb.com/zones/7502-dalaran and Orgrimmar http://www.wowdb.com/zones/1637-orgrimmar usable by the Horde as well as all of your favorite characters from the Suramar campaign, such as Thalyssra http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/98312-first-arcanist-thalyssra and Theryn http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/104618-theryn. Pandaren monks have also arrived to teach the Nightborne the ways of the http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk class.
