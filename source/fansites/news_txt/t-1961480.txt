Ashran in Legion
You will queue for Ashran similar to how you queue for battlegrounds. There will be no rewards unique to Ashran in Legion. The Ashran Dominance quest will reward honor and a strongbox similar to those you receive from winning a Battleground.

Queue Times
Can we get faster que timer pops please? waiting 30-45 mins a match just seems nutty
We're working on it. We want faster queues too Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/404061-faster-que-timers-please/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742605140?page=1#5

Legion Tuning Hotfix Live at 7pm PST on 3/8
A hotfix has been deployed to Alpha that will have significant impact on damage overall in PvP. Weapon damage, armor and secondary stats were incorrectly set for each class. Weapon damage was set to an extremely high value resulting in too much damage, especially from classes with fast attack speeds. In addition, we initially wanted secondary stats to be evenly distributed so that we can tune each spec appropriately based on feedback. You should now see an equal amount of each secondary stat when in PvP. Finally, armor was set to 4000 for all specializations resulting in some specs having too much armor.

All of these issues have been fixed in the current version of Alpha. We look forward to hearing your feedback. Thanks! Blue Tracker http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/404058-tuning-hotfix-live-at-7pm-pst-on-3-8/ / Official Forums http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742775129?page=1#1

DoT Spells Interrupting Actions
Currently Dots are breaking Flag Caps and drinks. There is no way this is intended right with Corruption being 60 sec timer on players you can kill a solo defending lock and as long as he had corruption on you no way you are capping the node before he spawns. same thing with drinks you get out of combat to drink and the dots force break drinking I know every healer is going to hate this in arena.
Thanks for the report. Do you know if a specific spell did this to you or have you had this experience with all damage over time effects?

Feral Druid Feedback -- Build 21232 -- 3-Mar
Re: The cooldown on 'powershifting':

This is indeed a philosophy change from live. Druids have been, and will continue to be, exceptionally good at breaking roots/snares. But that should be tied to shapeshifting, not macroing into skipping the shapeshift. It will provide better counterplay if thereâ€™s some cost albeit still spammable and small to shifting out of roots and snares.

Outlaw Rogue Feedback -- Build 21232 -- 3-Mar
In the build after next, you'll find that Roll the Bones rolls 6 dice, instead of 5. That should solve the rerolling-for-5-buffs issue you were discussing.

Mana Tap talent looks exactly like Soulburn Haunt, Improved Soulfire 4.0. An obligatory buff to maintain.
Do you think talents are a good place for gameplay styles that some people enjoy and some people don't? Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/704579767786299392
