Peak of Serenity
Monks get a new spell called Zen Pilgrimage  at level 30, which teleports them to the Peak of Serenity, a part of Kun-Lai Summit. This area is likely to function similar to the Death Knight starting area.

Currently it isn't very populated, just a few monk trainers and some students, but that is likely to change in a future patch. When a Monk wants to return, they can cast Zen Pilgrimage: Return , which should return them to a safe location that is near from where they left.

Level 90 Talent Animations Preview
The video we posted yesterday did not show spell effects at maximum particle density due to a change in the Mists of Pandaria client that we were not aware of. When other players cast a spell, you will see the low quality version, no matter how high your game settings are set. This made some of the effects look weak, like in this example 

We also looked at the effects in a more neutral colored zone and made some easier to see. Give your class another look if you had effects that depended on spell effects being turned up!

Jade Forest Going Offline in Next Beta Patch
With the next patch to the World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria beta, we will be temporarily removing the Jade Forest zone. We’re going to be making improvements to the zone, and want to put the focus of testing on other areas during this time.

As a result, starting with this next beta patch which is coming soon™, you will find that you are no longer able to enter Jade Forest. If you have any characters that are hanging out in Jade Forest when the zone is disabled, they will be automatically ported out to the following locations:


Valley of the Four Winds for Horde characters
Krasarang Wilds for Alliance characters


Characters that need experience to continue testing can visit either Orgrimmar or Stormwind. In each faction city, there will be an NPC that provides a quest which will reward enough XP to boost your characters from 85 to 86, as well as send you to Valley of the Four Winds to continue questing from there.

We expect Jade Forest to be offline for an extended period of time; we’ll provide further details as we progress with our updates to the zone. Thank you for testing Mists of Pandaria!

You now need an authenticator to use Battle.net balance and the RMAH.
In preparation for the upcoming launch of the real-money auction house, we will be updating the Diablo® III Auction House  Terms of Use and Battle.net Terms of Use  to cover some key changes related to the account-security measures required to use Battle.net Balance. Later today, the following updates will be made to the Terms of Use available on our website, and when the real-money auction house goes live, all players will be asked to re-read and accept these changes the next time they play Diablo III.

Battle.net Balance and Authenticator Update
With the introduction of the real-money auction house, account security will become more important than ever. To help ensure that players have a positive experience when using the real-money auction house, we’ve made some adjustments to how players can use and access their Battle.net Balance.

Starting today, in order to use Battle.net Balance , players will be required to have a Battle.net Authenticator or Battle.net Mobile Authenticator attached to their Battle.net account. For clarity, this means you’ll need to have an Authenticator to add to your balance via Battle.net Account Management or to send the proceeds of your real-money auction house sales to your Battle.net Balance.

Please note that players who previously added Battle.net Balance to their account prior to this change will be able to use it to make eligible purchases  on Battle.net and in the auction house without attaching an Authenticator. However, an Authenticator will be required to add to your balance in the future, as explained above.

While we understand that this may be an inconvenience for some players, we want to ensure that players feel confident when using Battle.net Balance to make auction house transactions.

You can learn more about the Battle.net Authenticator, Battle.net Mobile Authenticator, and other account security information by clicking here
