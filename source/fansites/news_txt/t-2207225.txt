Patch 7.2.5 - Blight Boar
The new band is finished setting up at the Darkmoon Faire in Patch 7.2.5! Their name? Blight Boar.

Baby, baby, baby! This is the illest, realest, deadest band you've ever seen! They will melt your face, figuratively and literally! Before I met these guys, I was alive and had all my skin! Now I'm dead and filthy rich!
Catch Blight Boar here, every hour on the half hour!
Or you could come see a GOOD band! The Blight Boar concert will begin in thirty minutes!
If you're interested in gettin' down, the Blight Boar concert starts in twenty!
Blight Boar is playing their underground show on the east side of the island! Your headliner Blight Boar goes on in ten minutes!
My rockin' and rollin' beauties! You're in the right place to melt your face! Allow me to humbly introduce... Blight Booooar!



I will prove once and for all that only a knight from the grave can rule heavy metal.
Though you fight to stay alive, your bodies freeze and shatter!
Darkness falls across the land, the rocking hour is close at hand!
Grisly ghouls from every tomb are closing in to seal your doom.
Another soul for getting down.
Another soul for my armies!
You have failed Blight Boar, your fans now serve my armies of the dead!
