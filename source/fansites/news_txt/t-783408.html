Arena Season 9 Models Preview<br>
It&apos;s time for some PvP love! Just like with any model preview, you have to keep in mind that I don&apos;t have really have any decent way to check how the sets are supposed to be displayed in the first place and it always lead to a few errors (Mostly on glove/boots models). The multi race/gender preview will most likely be available when Blizzard finishes polishing the sets and actually deploy them on beta servers. <br>

Divine Storm<br>
We&apos;ve been toying with a change to Divine Storm to make it more like Fan of Knives. Specifically, you could use it whenever you want, for mana, but it would share a cooldown with Crusader Strike. It would have nothing to do with Holy Power (unless Divine Purpose still applied). The idea would be that sometimes you&apos;re okay giving up the single target rotation of Crusader Strike -&gt; Templar&apos;s Verdict in return for being able to use an AE attack every 4.5 to 3 sec. It&apos;s too early yet to know if this design will work out.<br>
<br>
Divine Storm has a great visual and many long-time Ret paladins have a soft spot for it, so we&apos;d like to get it back to more common use. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27509091869/ret-aoe-divine-storm/))<br>

Searing Totem<br>
As I said a few weeks ago, we&apos;re still working on the AI of Searing Totem. If we can chill out its latent homicidal tendencies, then we could consider bumping the range. Currently bumping the range would just infuriate your group leader more often. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27509091757/searing-totem/))</div></div>
