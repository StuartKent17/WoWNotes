Items

The wrapper quest for Assaults can no longer award Azerite Armor Caches.

Developers’ notes: We'd like Assaults to remain a lucrative source of equipment for characters who have recently hit level 120, but this wasn’t a good source for Azerite gear, as players will want to obtain newer Azerite gear with 5 powers.


Fixed an issue that prevented the Crest of Pa'ku from being activated by Healing spells.
Fixed a bug where some on-use Battle of Dazar'alor trinkets were not properly triggering the on-use cooldowns of other trinkets.
Shadowtome can now be upgraded by Ensorcelled Tarots.
Heart of Azeroth

Developers’ notes: Based on data observed since Tides of Vengeance launched, we have several tuning changes for Azerite traits. The goal of these changes is to improve the usability of some class traits, as well as rein in the power of some of the newer traits in a way that still preserves their core coolness. Additionally, some Azerite traits changed value dramatically with changes to specs in Tides of Vengeance, so we’re taking this opportunity to rebalance those traits as the Mythic Raid opens.
