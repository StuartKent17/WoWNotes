MMO-Champion Forums and Moderators Update!<br>
The release of the expansion is behind us, it&apos;s time for a small forum announcement! <br>
<br>
1. Moderators<br>
40 moderators have been added to the forums, the goal with this addition is to ban less and have more people around to prevent problems before they happen instead of having to swing the banhammer. They&apos;ve been around for a couple of days now, and if you really want to complain about someone you can always send me a well-written Private Message about the situation.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that the first step to discuss a &quot;bad&quot; moderator decision is the Ban Appeal forum. However, I would like to remind everyone that the forum is only here if you think the moderator was wrong and misunderstood something, posting to explain that &quot;but it was sarcasm!&quot; after you spent 10 posts insulting someone&apos;s mother really isn&apos;t going to do anything good.<br>
<br>
2. New Forums!<br>
In an effort to clean up the General Discussions forums and keep things alive, three (well, technically 4) new forums have been created. <br>
<br>
WoW Forums<br>
<br>
Achievements (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/314-Achievements) - A lot of people are addicted to achievements, they now have a dedicated forum. <br>
<br>
<br>
Off-Topic Forums<br>
<br>
General Off-Topic (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/315-General-Off-Topic) - We finally have a dedicated Off-Topic forums, this is where anything not related to World of Warcraft goes. Obviously the moderation will be a little heavier here than on the other forums to keep things under control but I&apos;m sure we can make something great out of it if we all decide to be nice.<br>
Fun Stuff (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/316-Fun-Stuff) - This forum is for all the fun stuff you want to post all the time, but can&apos;t because it&apos;s not related to WoW. We&apos;re talking about Photoshop contests, funny pictures, forum games, funny videos, etc ... (PS: The post count is disabled on this forum, don&apos;t bother spamming)<br>
Sports (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/317-Sports) - Everything related to sports.<br>
Cinema / TV Shows / Music / Books (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/292-Cinema-TV-Shows-Music-Books) - This isn&apos;t really a new forum, just the result of a merge of the TV Shows / Cinema and Music forum. We also added Books there for the smarter forum posters. <br>
<br>
<br>
The expanded team of moderators will be happy to see you on their forums! Now might be a good time to register (http://www.mmo-champion.com/register.php)!<br>

<br>
Guild Experience Change<br>
We have decided to remove the added bonus of gaining Guild Experience from Guild Achievements earned. This change will realign Guild Achievements with our philosophy held for normal Achievements, which are intended to be predominantly their own reward (barring the rare exception of special achievements that grant an additional reward.) Previously, the experience reward had been seen as an additional side bonus and not something that should have been significantly skewing the advancement of guilds. During the beta, we greatly increased leveling speed across the board and since most characters were copied from templates, guild experience from Achievements didn&#x2019;t seem imbalanced. It has become clear that an imbalance does exist and should be addressed to ensure that guilds progress at the rates expected within the daily Guild Experience limits.<br>
<br>
For guilds that are currently above the normally possible experience limit, we will be readjusting it back to the expected limit once more. This will not affect Guild Reputation gains at this point in time. <br>
<br>
<br>
Cataclysm Hotfixes - December 7<br>
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. While many have already been deployed on all realms, some may not be implemented until the next time your realm is restarted. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.<br>
<br>
December 7<br>
General<br>

The Story So Far... Part II<br>
<br>
Heralds of Twilight<br>
<br>
As the world&apos;s races struggled for survival in the wake of the Cataclysm, details came to light concerning what&#x2014;or who&#x2014;had caused the disaster. Prior to the upheaval, the Fury of Earth had cryptically told Thrall that Azeroth&apos;s instability had been caused by something good that had turned unnatural. Something that wished to inflict pain and suffering on the entire world.<br>
<br>
The warning was in reference to an ancient being once known as Neltharion the Earth-Warder. Long ago, this Aspect of the black dragonflight had been granted dominion over Azeroth&apos;s earthly expanses by the benevolent titans. Yet the incessant whisperings of the Old Gods had gradually driven Neltharion insane and caused him to abandon his sacred charge. He had later revealed his treachery during the War of the Ancients by turning an immensely powerful artifact&#x2014;the Dragon Soul&#x2014;against his allies, annihilating nearly all of the blue dragonflight. Forever after, Neltharion would answer to a new name: Deathwing.<br>
<br>
Deathwing&apos;s murderous aim had become the subjugation of the other dragonflights, a goal left unfulfilled decades ago when he was chased into hiding by the Dragon Aspects Alexstrasza, Ysera, Nozdormu, and Malygos. In Deathwing&apos;s absence, agents of the black dragonflight continued one of his darkest schemes: creating a more powerful breed of dragon. The most promising of these vile experiments resulted in twilight dragons, malefic creatures that first appeared in the cursed and abandoned dwarven city of Grim Batol, and later within the hallowed Chamber of the Aspects.<br>
<br>
During many of these developments, Deathwing remained hidden. Rumors regarding his death circulated, leading to the assumption that his malevolent influence on Azeroth was at an end. Such was not the case. In Deepholm, the domain of earth within the Elemental Plane, Deathwing nourished his hatred of Azeroth&apos;s inhabitants, awaiting his moment to burst forth from his lair and reforge the world in flame. That fateful day&#x2014;the Cataclysm&#x2014;arrived shortly after Thrall&apos;s return from Outland.<br>
<br>
Deathwing&apos;s violent return did much more than sunder the lands of Azeroth; it also ruptured the boundaries of the Elemental Plane. In the aftermath, chaotic elementals emerged into the world from within the Abyssal Maw, Deepholm, the Firelands, and the Skywall. Working with Deathwing, the Twilight&apos;s Hammer cult and its twisted leader, Cho&apos;gall, established footholds across the world with the aid of twilight dragons and enslaved elementals.<br>
<br>
Thus far, many of Azeroth&apos;s defenders have devoted themselves to combating the cult and allaying the elemental forces threatening to tear the world apart. Chief among these champions are the shaman of the Earthen Ring, including Thrall, Nobundo, and Muln Earthfury. Other Horde and Alliance heroes have also risen to the challenge, but their focus has been split due to skirmishes between the two factions.<br>
<br>
Amid the turmoil, two other beleaguered groups are striving to overcome their own hurdles. The human kingdom of Gilneas, walled off from the rest of the world for years, has come under assault by Queen Sylvanas&apos;s Forsaken. Aside from the undead, the kingdom is assailed by a debilitating curse that transforms its victims into feral wolf-beasts known as worgen. Meanwhile, a volcanic eruption on the tropical Isle of Kezan has ousted the Bilgewater Cartel and other goblins from their homes. Trade Prince Gallywix has capitalized on this moment of panic and swindled his fellow goblins out of their life savings&#x2014;and their freedom&#x2014;in exchange for transport off of Kezan.<br>
<br>
Much like Gilneas and the Bilgewater Cartel, other kingdoms and factions the world over face their own trials, from internal political strife to the reappearance of ancient foes. Yet there is one inescapable truth that they all share: if Deathwing and his nihilistic servants are left unopposed, the Cataclysm will pale in comparison to the chaos that lies ahead for Azeroth.<br>
<br>
<br>
A New Age Has Begun&#x2026;<br>
The undead armies of the Lich King have been vanquished, and the campaign in Northrend has come to an end. Now Azeroth faces a new threat, as Deathwing the Destroyer has burst forth from the heart of the Maelstrom, unleashing widespread devastation upon Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms. As the world teeters on the brink of destruction, champions of the Alliance and Horde must embark on a quest that will take them from the World Tree to the bottom of the Great Sea to the elemental planes themselves, looking for a way to bring an end to Deathwing&#x2019;s reign of ruin.<br>

Ganked on PvP servers<br>
What you&apos;re experiencing is world PvP on a PvP realm. I realize that it&apos;s not for everyone, but it&apos;s not something that we plan to adjust. The harsh reality is that life on a PvP realm can be difficult, and if you aren&apos;t prepared for the rigors of playing on such a realm, then it&apos;s probably in your best interest to transfer to a normal realm, or, if you cannot afford that, then consider creating a new character on a normal realm.<br>
<br>
There&apos;s never been a better time to create a fresh character. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/141299/this-is-not-fair))<br>
<br>
Realms Queues<br>
We&apos;re in the process right now of doing our quickest fix for queues which is simply raising player caps. Most realms that are seeing a high queue (once the cap changes go through) should see a substantial halving or more of their wait times.<br>
<br>
Once that&apos;s done we can then continue to evaluate and take further action as necessary. In our years of experience, free character transfers are marginally successful in that the vast majority of players hate queues, but the vast majority also aren&apos;t willing to leave their realms and guilds to avoid them. It&apos;s a solution, and one we may employ, but it&apos;s one that isn&apos;t quick and easy, and with widely varying histories of success. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/141185/extremely-dissapointed))<br>
<br>
[...] We do have another round of player cap increases going out in the next little bit but bottom line is we&apos;re most likely going to have to work toward free transfers. They&apos;re not super simple to execute so it&apos;s not something that&apos;s going to be available today.<br>
<br>
Anyway, we&apos;ll keep you informed as we go. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/141185/extremely-dissapointed))</div></div>
