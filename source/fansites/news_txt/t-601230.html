Hyjal post on Elitistjerks.com (http://elitistjerks.com/showthread.php?t=11407)<br>
When you zone into the raid instance you start out, as Alliance, at a small alliance base with lady Jaine Proudmoore and lots of 70 elites, including horsemen, dwarf riflemen, NE priests, bloodelf Sorceress&apos; (?).<br>
<br>
The starting area is standard alliance structures, few towers and buildings, think Theramore. You start the encounter and rush out to fight Undead - a few 70 elite abominations (naxx) are the first encounter.<br>
