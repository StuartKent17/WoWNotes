Thank you for your continued testing and feedback! 

Next Patch: Background Downloader
The next major content patch is coming, and it's big. In order to smooth the way, we will shortly enable background downloading of most of the data for this patch. People who use the Launcher and have background downloading enabled will automatically start getting the data. The Downloader downloads faster in general now, so you may want to adjust your background download settings. You can adjust these settings in the Laucher, by visiting the Options page. If you want the fastest possible download, check the "Don't throttle background download". However, note that this can affect the performance of other programs running at the same time.
