Patch 3.3 - New Totems<br>
A lot of shamans yelled at me because I posted a video of the new totems for dwarves and not for orcs and trolls. Fixed. Note: Dwarves Shamans will NOT be available with the patch, only the totems were included here. You will have to wait for the expansion to play one. <br>

Auction House (Mini) Guide Part 3 - Prospecting!<br>
It&apos;s monday! Time for a small addition to the ever popular Auction House guides! If you missed the first 2 posts make sure you take a look at it (even if it&apos;s not really needed) <br>
<br>
Auction House Guide - Introduction and Enchanting (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/auction-house-guide-vanish-bugs-comics/)<br>
Auction House Guide - Inscription (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/auction-house-guide-inscription/)<br>
<br>
Today I&apos;m just going to point out how simple it can be to make money with little effort, the only thing you will need is a Jewelcrafter.<br>
<br>
Just head to the Auction House and check the price of Thorium Ore (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/10620/thorium-ore/), then check the prices of <br>
<br>
Large Opal (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/12799/large-opal/)<br>
Star Ruby (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/7910/star-ruby/)<br>
Azerothian Diamond (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/12800/azerothian-diamond/)<br>
Blue Sapphire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/12361/blue-sapphire/)<br>
Huge Emerald (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/12364/huge-emerald/)<br>
<br>
That&apos;s the 5 gems you will get when you prospect Thorium, the interesting thing is ... on most servers, their value is much higher than what it costs to prospect them from ore bought at the Auction House. In the past people commented on my guides to point out that I play on a crazy server and that everything I write is useless on any other server. I&apos;ll just use Wowhead&apos;s average prices this time: Thorium price is 40G a stack, gems are :<br>
<br>
Large Opal (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=12799) - 20G<br>
Star Ruby (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=12364) - 20G<br>
Azerothian Diamond (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=12800) - 15G<br>
Blue Sapphire (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=12361) - 10G<br>
Huge Emerald (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=7910) - 5G<br>
<br>
The average price of these 5 gems is 14G, you have a pretty high chance to get 2 of them (probably 30%) but I&apos;ll just assume that you&apos;re very unlucky and always get one. 4 gems at an average price of 14G will sell for 56G ... That&apos;s a 40% profit just for pushing the &quot;prospect&quot; key. <br>
<br>
The profit is much higher most of the time because you get more than one gem but I don&apos;t really like to theorycraft about that kind of stuff, if you need a spreadsheet to figure out if it&apos;s worth doing it, the profit is already too low and you shouldn&apos;t do it (or you really suck at maths but let&apos;s pretend you&apos;re all smart!)<br>
<br>
You can also expand that to a few more ores, but Thorium is usually the most profitable. (You will also need to wait a few days before actually doing that, because everyone on your server saw this guide and relisted the Thorium at 300% of its original price)<br>
<br>
Yes, that&apos;s it. The title says (Mini) guide for a reason and I thought it was a pretty good way to point out how easy it is to make gold from the AH without any effort. (And the Thorium trick is actually VERY profitable on the long run, you should be able to pull 200~300G/day out of this without too much problem)<br>
