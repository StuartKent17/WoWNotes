I think this is the last model added in the latest beta build, it took a little more time than usual to get everything fixed because the new streaming client hates me but I think we should be ok. Actually, the next few days will probably be interesting. <br>
<br>
The Twilight Ascendant (Air) model has been added to the game, I also added the Fire model from last week to the screenshot. <br>

There is also a short video of some of the new models from TotalBiscuit, who seems to do most of the work for me lately.<br>

Password Security Information<br>
Seriously, listen to the guy. Getting your WoW account stolen and restored within a few days is one thing, losing your hotmail account, your MSN contacts, and fighting with the tech support to get your password back is another. Yes, you can replace &quot;hotmail&quot; with anything else, you can even replace it with &quot;puppies&quot; because, yes, they will steal your puppies too, that&apos;s how evil keyloggers are.<br>
We have been helping players deal with account theft for years now, and unfortunately, roughly a third of players make a very basic security mistake: using the same password for all of their security needs.<br>
<br>
If you are serious about protecting your account and your personal security, your Battle.net password should be different from your email account password -- or other personal passwords for that matter!<br>
<br>
No one wants account thieves rooting around in their personal email, address book, and contact lists. Too often we see thieves breaking in to this information because their target has used the same password across multiple types of accounts. Not only can this give thieves access to your account, it can lead to compromises far outside of Battle.net as well.<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s immensely important that everyone use separate passwords for separate applications, including games. Secure passwords have both numeric and alphabetical values, and are usually at least 10 characters in length.<br>

Ysera open eyes<br>
As I&apos;ve said before, her eyes are very intentionally open. This is, in fact, part of the fiction and will be explained in one of our upcoming novels as well as a future event in game.<br>
<br>
If it suits you, feel free to RP going CRAZY INSANE after looking into her eyes in Hyjal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399010284/ysera-model-feedback/))<br>
<br>
Bloat vs. Choice<br>
I think the word &quot;bloat&quot; has become like the word &quot;clunky&quot; in these forums. It&apos;s so often used as a synonym for &quot;I would have designed this differently&quot; that it has lost a lot of specific meaning.<br>
<br>
I think in the end one of the things we&apos;ve really learned about what players are looking for in a talent tree is that they are often looking for different things. Some players are perfectly happy spending every point on say damage. Damage is what they do, so any point not related to damage feels wasted. Some players want every possible talent build to be legit. They don&apos;t want there to be any wrong answers such that they could almost assign points at random and have something that was functional and diverse. Some players, and this surprised us a little, like to have the ability to make bad choices and are perfectly happy making wrong choices -- to them the freedom to choose trumps the desire for power. Some players just want every point and agonize about having to leave anything out. Some get really bent out of shape at the thought of spending even 1 talent point on a talent that they may not use say once every 30 min or so. They would rather respec into a situational ability when that situation comes up rather than have it just in case. Some are mostly interested in just seeing something different. They are less interested in the perfect talent tree than they are in having them change over time. Even powerful abilities feel like old hat and they want the new hotness. You see this a lot for the classes whose talent trees changed earliest in Cataclysm, who are now wondering when &quot;their overhaul&quot; is coming. Opposing them are the nostalgia buffs who can&apos;t stand the thought of any talent or ability going away because it&apos;s iconic for their class.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m really not building towards any kind of conclusion with any of that. It has just been interesting to see the feedback. I guess I can offer that you might want to be careful about who you think you are speaking for when you say &quot;we feel this&quot; or &quot;we don&apos;t want that.&quot; Players, even the microcosm of the forum community, want different things.

Holy Shield / 15% block<br>
Yeah, as some of the other posters said the issue is not really whether 4.5% or 8% (which is pretty liberal) is the amount of damage reduced. You&apos;re comparing full uptime to no uptime. If a paladin refuses to use their mitigation talents (i.e. stubbornly or sloppily choose not to use Holy Shield ever) then they are going to take more damage and suffer the consequences.<br>
<br>
The issue is how catastrophic is it if you are sloppy and let Holy Shield slip off for a short time or choose to use Word of Glory instead. The answer is probably: not very.<br>
<br>
Fifteen percent block is rarely going to make the difference between you being alive or dead. It will make a difference over the course of a fight in how much damage you take and therefore how much mana your healers need to invest. For that reason it&apos;s an excellent idea to keep Holy Shield up a lot. But if you let it fall down every now and then, you probably won&apos;t explode. (And let&apos;s remember there are several emergency buttons if you are on the verge of explodination that will mitigate a lot more damage than a block.)<br>
<br>
The reason I keep comparing it to 15% damage reduction, is because damage reduction affects every hit you take. Block is a chance to take less damage on every swing. Integrated over the course of an entire fight, you will probably block 15% more with Holy Shield up. But if you let it drop for a few boss swings, you are going to take far less than 15% more damage. In fact, you may take no extra damage at all (i.e. you would have blocked anyway). In fact, you may take no damage at all (i.e. you dodged or parried).

<br>
Holy Shield uptime<br>
I would say we are actually giving you control over your ability to survive. Today paladin tanking is very automated. Today the control isn&apos;t in your hands. We need to change that.<br>
<br>
Look, nothing on normal mode is going to be tuned to the point where a paladin tank who lets Holy Shield fall down wipes the group. On heroic mode, yes, you will probably be asked to play to the best of your ability. That&apos;s the purpose of those challenges. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399010971/gc-please-stop-understating-15-block/))<br>
<br>
Why is Holy Shield duration so short?<br>
The reason we haven&apos;t done that is we&apos;re concerned that once you have any Holy Power left for extra things, that you then assume you&apos;d be balanced around those extra things. So for example, the model goes from paladins having to keep 15% block up to having to keep 15% block up *and* heal themselves every rotation. That&apos;s still a model we might consider though.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re happy with the bones of the design. The details and tuning aren&apos;t quite right yet, but we have many ideas left to try. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399010971/gc-please-stop-understating-15-block/))<br>

Shadow Power<br>
Shadow Power is now called &quot;Blackout&quot; and is a passive talent tree bonus for picking the tree. It provides 200% crits to Shadow spells. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26398980740/concerning-shadow-priests/))<br>
<br>
Archangel and Evangelism<br>
Archangel and Evangelism don&apos;t stack. The intent is that Dark Archangel is used when burst matters more than sustained damage (Dark Evangelism = Sustained, Dark Archangel = Burst), and not really something you&apos;d do rotationally. In PvE you might do it if the target is going to die soon (when sustained dps really doesn&apos;t really matter), for target swapping, right before Bloodlust etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262987070/shadow-priest-concerns-for-cataclysm/))<br>
<br>
Mind Spike redesign<br>
There are some additional Shadow changes that are upcoming, including a slight re-design for Mind Spike. The role for Mind Spike is still something you can do when you don&apos;t have the opportunity for your full blown rotation, but we also don&apos;t want you to feel like you have to work it into your normal rotation.

Mind Flay<br>
Mind Flay is going back to a 3 sec cast time. As sometimes happens in beta, the data were pulled right while we were changing the spell, resulting in it being bugged. Sorry. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262987070/shadow-priest-concerns-for-cataclysm/))</div></div>
