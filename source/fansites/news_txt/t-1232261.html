Fusible (http://fusible.com/2012/11/blizzard-entertainment-registers-the-domain-name-projectblackstone-com/) noticed that ProjectBlackstone.com was recently purchased by Blizzard Entertainment. It doesn&apos;t mean much yet but the choice of domain name could point to a side project for Diablo 3 or even pet battles (They also appear to have purchased WarcraftBattles.com (http://fusible.com/2012/10/blizzard-entertainment-registers-warcraftbattles-com-domain-name/) last month).<br>
<br>
We&apos;re mostly reporting this to have a nice point of discussion for it, but nothing really points to it being a major project (= probably not anything Titan related). <br>
