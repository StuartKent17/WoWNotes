RP Realm Rules
Sorry guys for not catching this a bit sooner but I did want to reply to this.

Since it hasn't been stated recently that I can find anywhere I just wanted to reassure you guys that the usual rules as well as the subset of rules for RP servers still applies. So if you're being harassed by players or seeing players with non RP names that are clearly ridiculous, please report them. We rely on player reports so as long as you are reporting these players our lovely Game Masters can investigate. 

While I love seeing the passion and influx that Project 60 has brought on and sparked into the community, its important to be respectful of players on these RP servers who are there because it is their place to have an RP focused community hence the subset of RP server rules and server designation."

I want to add an additional clarification that the naming rule is really the only thing that is separate from RP to other servers, and the rules on harassment are universal regardless of server type.

The blame is not on the Project 60 community itself and most of the people running it have not endorsed any harassment and have been encouraging the opposite. I would attribute any sort of harassment/negative behavior to be an outlier and someone that would probably be doing it anyway even if it wasn't for the Project 60 influx. If you encounter this please just report it so our Game Masters can look into it.

How Champions Are Made
In the opening week, ten teams descended on Anaheim in the run-up to the finals, with two teams eliminated on day one.

Panda Global took down Rockets Eclipse with relative ease, to be met by defending world champions Method: Triforce. Panda Global were on fire, with the fever-pitch energy of the crowd fanning the flames. They beat the champions 3-1 in the semi-final to win their place in the final.

EU vs NA

Across the bracket, the top-seeded North America team—Method Synergy—faced Europe’s second seeded team, ABC. ABC’s tried and tested formula of Alec on Mage and Niksi on Rogue, seen the previous year, worked like a charm taking down NA’s #1 team 3-2.

ABC Easy As 123…4
The finals in 2017 were once again NA vs EU. The comeback kids on Panda Global looked a little shaky and struggled to hold form, testing the limits of their passionate fans’ patience and creating a tense, exciting atmosphere throughout the arena. Sensing victory, ABC took full control; beating Panda Global in a nail-biting set of games 4-0—earning them their rightful place in World of Warcraft Arena history.

Congratulations to ABC: World Champions!
