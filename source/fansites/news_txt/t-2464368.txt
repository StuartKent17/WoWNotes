<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>It is highly recommended that you plan your raid setup ahead of time, since there are a few factors that will make the achievements slightly easier. You can bring anywhere between 10 to 30 players as long as you have classes that can cover all buffs and debuffs, as well as some CC. There are also a few key classes which you should bring:


1 Rogue to stun the Lurker every 15-20 seconds for De Lurker Be'loa https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13430-de-lurker-beloa
1 Demon Hunter, Rogue or another class with high mobility for Snow Fun Allowed https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13410-snow-fun-allowed
1 or 2 Death Knights to grip one of the raptors for Walk the Dinosaur https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13325-walk-the-dinosaur


You need to make sure that your raid has:

A player that can go tank for We Got Spirit, How About You? https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13425-we-got-spirit-how-about-you
The Singing Sunflower https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/51090-singing-sunflower pet required for Praise the Sunflower https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13345-praise-the-sunflower
The Blingtron 4000 https://www.wowdb.com/items/87214-blingtron-4000 and Blingtron 5000 https://www.wowdb.com/items/111821-blingtron-5000 toys required for I Got Next! https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13401-i-got-next



<h2 id="Champion of the Light">Can I Get a Hek Hek Hek Yeah? https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13316-can-i-get-a-hek-hek-hek-yeah</h2>Before you start the Champions of the Light boss fight, every member of the raid will need to click on the nearby Mysterious Trashpile https://www.wowdb.com/objects/316841-mysterious-trashpile to get Jani's Favor https://www.wowdb.com/spells/288579-janis-favor. Throughout the fight players will get transformed into Saurids and get an extra action button they can use to steal a shiny coin from the enemies.


https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/thumb/trashpile.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/trashpile.jpg 

For this achievement you will need to steal 3 shinies from each of the enemy NPCs. There is one Crusader, two Disciples and the Champion of the Light so you will have to steal 12 coins:


3 shiny coins from the Crusaders
6 shiny coins from Disciples
3 shiny coins from the Champion of the Light



<h2 id="Grong">Barrel of Monkeys https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13383-barrel-of-monkeys</h2>By the stairs before the boss fight against Grong you will find 6 clickable Heavy Barrel https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/149043-heavy-barrel’s. The raid team should pick them up and carry them to the boss area. 


https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/thumb/barrels.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/barrels.jpg 

You will then need to pull the boss and let him hit the Heavy Barrels https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/149043-heavy-barrel with Reverberating Slam https://www.wowdb.com/spells/282179-reverberating-slam Horde or Deathly Slam https://www.wowdb.com/spells/282543-deathly-slam Alliance. 

Each Heavy Barrel https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/149043-heavy-barrel that is destroyed will buff the boss with Going Ape https://www.wowdb.com/spells/289050-going-ape, granting Grong a 20% damage increase for 30 seconds. 

Once all 6 Heavy Barrel https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/149043-heavy-barrel's have been destroyed, defeat the boss and you'll get the achievement.


<h2 id="Jadefire Masters">Hidden Dragon https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13431-hidden-dragon</h2>For this achievement you will first have to pull the Jadefire Masters and then pick up Jade Serpent Egg https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/149324-jade-serpent-egg. The egg is hidden, but will become visible when you get very close to it. Since the boss areas are different for Horde and Alliance, the locations of the egg are also different.


https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/thumb/egg01.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/egg01.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/thumb/egg02.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/egg02.jpg 

Avoid taking damage from the Living Bomb https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/146107-living-bomb or Phoenix Strike https://www.wowdb.com/spells/284388-phoenix-strike as they will break the egg.

Once the monk transforms into a Jade Serpent, all players should stack with the player carrying the egg and let it get hit by Dragon's Breath https://www.wowdb.com/spells/286396-dragons-breath. Defeat the boss and you'll get the achievement.


<h2 id="Opulence">Praise the Sunflower https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13345-praise-the-sunflower</h2>This achievement is personal. You will need to use the /praise emote on a Singing Sunflower https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/51090-singing-sunflower while buffed with Brilliant Aura https://www.wowdb.com/spells/284802-brilliant-aura. The pet doesn’t have to be your own.

You can set the Sunflower as your focus target and use this macro so you can quickly praise it:

/tar focus
/praise

The Brilliant Aura https://www.wowdb.com/spells/284802-brilliant-aura is a buff that requires one or more players to pick up the Topaz of Brilliant Sunlight https://www.wowdb.com/spells/284645-topaz-of-brilliant-sunlight. These players need to gain 100 stacks of Incandescence https://www.wowdb.com/spells/284664-incandescence by simply staying away from other players. 

At 100 stacks these players will gain the Grossly Incandescent! https://www.wowdb.com/spells/284798-grossly-incandescent buff. All players standing near the buffed player will be granted Brilliant Aura https://www.wowdb.com/spells/284802-brilliant-aura. You will have to /praise the Sunflower while under the effect of the aura, and then kill the boss.


<h2 id="Conclave of the Chosen">Walk the Dinosaur https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13325-walk-the-dinosaur</h2>For this achievement you will need to leave alive at least one of the first Ravenous Stalkers https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/148962-ravenous-stalker until the end of the fight. 

Every 20 seconds the raptor will fixate a different player with Mark of Prey https://www.wowdb.com/spells/282209-mark-of-prey. The fixated player will need to kite the raptor away from damage to avoid killing it. 

Death Knight's Death Grip https://www.wowdb.com/spells/49576-death-grip can help keep the Ravenous Stalker https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/148962-ravenous-stalker away from the raid to avoid damaging it.


<h2 id="King Rastakhan">We Got Spirit, How About You? https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13425-we-got-spirit-how-about-you</h2>To do this achievement you will need to keep the phantom adds alive until the end of the fight. 

A third tank is ideal for this achievement as that player can pick up the adds and move them away from the raid. Simply tanking them away from incoming damage and ensuring Grave Bolt https://www.wowdb.com/spells/285572-grave-bolt is interrupted should be enough.


<h2 id="High Tinker Mekkatorque">I Got Next! https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13401-i-got-next</h2>To complete this achievement you'll need an engineer with a Blingtron 4000 https://www.wowdb.com/items/87214-blingtron-4000 and Blingtron 5000 https://www.wowdb.com/items/111821-blingtron-5000.

Summon the Blingtrons before starting the fight, and shortly after the boss is engaged, the Blingtron MK2 https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/149240-blingtron-mk2 will spawn. Defeat it, and then finish the boss fight and you will get the achievement.

Blingtron MK2 https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/149240-blingtron-mk2 has only 2 abilities: Blingstorm https://www.wowdb.com/spells/289864-blingstorm AoE damage ability and Gold Chain Lightning https://www.wowdb.com/spells/289870-gold-chain-lightning Chain Lightning ability, can be interrupted.


<h2 id="Stormwall Blockade">De Lurker Be'loa https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13430-de-lurker-beloa</h2>This achievement required you to summon De Lurker Be'loa https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/149289-de-lurker-beloa and then defeat the Stormwall Blockade encounter. You do not have to defeat the Lurker.

To summon De Lurker Be'loa https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/149289-de-lurker-beloa you need to click on a fish pool to the left of the docks after the boss has been engaged. Leave one player on the docks while the rest of the raid does the boss normally.

After clicking on the pool, the player will start pulling a rope out of the water for 2 minutes. The player will be constantly pulled towards the water, and have to dodge incoming waves and swirls to avoid dying.

Once De Lurker Be'loa https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/149289-de-lurker-beloa has been summoned, and after transitioning to the last phase, the raid will have to deal with its 2 abilities alongside the normal boss abilities:


Hydro Blast https://www.wowdb.com/spells/289479-hydro-blast
Undertow https://www.wowdb.com/spells/289487-undertow


To deal with the Lurker, you will need one player ideally an Outlaw Rogue solely focusing on stunning it every time it casts Hydro Blast https://www.wowdb.com/spells/289479-hydro-blast. The rest of the raid will need to kill the boss before it enrages, while dealing with Undertow https://www.wowdb.com/spells/289487-undertow in addition to the standard fight mechanics.


<h2 id="Lady Jaina Proudmoore">Snow Fun Allowed https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13410-snow-fun-allowed</h2>During the fight against Jaina Proudmoore, in the Howling Winds intermission, 3 snow mounds will spawn in the frozen area of the fight. Players need to run through the mounds before interrupting Jaina, or the snow will disappear.

Rogues and Demon Hunters are great for this because they can immune, rush through the narrow path, and start looking for the snow right away. Once all 3 mounds have been run through, players carrying the snow should stack near one of the barrels to create a Frosty Snowmon https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/149244-frosty-snowmon.


https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/thumb/snowfun01.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/snowfun01.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/thumb/snowfun02.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/snowfun02.jpg 

The player targeted with Broadside https://www.wowdb.com/spells/288218-broadside should drop this on the barrel, removing its Refractive Ice https://www.wowdb.com/spells/288219-refractive-ice buff. Destroy the barrel, and the explosion will melt the Frosty Snowmon https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/149244-frosty-snowmon and grant you the requirements for the achievement. 

Defeat the encounter and you'll get the final achievement in Dazar'alor. Congrats!
