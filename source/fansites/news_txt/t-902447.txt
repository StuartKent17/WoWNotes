Boubouille2011-05-11, 01:38 AMPatch 4.2 PTR Notes - May 10th Update
Classes: General

All healing critical strikes now heal for 2 times a normal heal +100%, up from 1.5 times a normal heal +50%.


Buffs

All class abilities which place a buff on friendly targets no longer generate any threat. This goes for raid-wide buffs like Mark of the Wild and Power Word: Fortitude, as well as triggered effects such as Blessed Resilience or Fingers of Frost, and single-target buffs like Dark Intent and Hysteria. The exception is buffs which directly cause healing or damage, such as Thorns or Renew. Abilities such as these still generate normal threat.


Pets

The Aggressive pet stance has been removed and replaced with the Assist stance. This stance will cause the player's pet to attack the player's target. The pet will not change targets unless the master attacks a new target for a few seconds.


Spell Interrupts

When interrupted while casting a single-school spell such as Mind Flay or Frostbolt, players will now be able to cast dual-school spells such as Mind Spike Frost and Shadow schools or Frostfire Bolt Frost and Fire schools. However, being interrupted while casting a dual-school spell will still interrupt all respective schools as intended.

PvP
Conquest Points

The minimum cap on Conquest Points earned per week is now 1500 at 1500 or less Battleground rating. The maximum cap remains 3000 at 3000 or more Battleground rating. The cap continues to scale non-linearly between those two points.
The game now separately tracks different Conquest Point caps for Battlegrounds and Arenas. The cap for Arena rating will always be 2/3 of the cap for Battleground rating at any given Arena rating. Players may earn a total number of Conquest Points per week equal to the higher of these two caps, but once players have reached the cap for either Arenas or Battlegrounds, they can no longer earn Conquest Points from that source. Conquest Points from Battleground holidays only count toward the total Conquest Point cap.


Quests & Creatures

There are no longer oddities in the critical strike and dodge chance of lower-level creatures.


User Interface

Raid Profiles are in the process of being implemented and are not fully functional. Raid Profiles will allow players to save the raid window user interface layout based on type of content i.e. 10-player raids, 25-player raids, Battlegrounds, etc..
