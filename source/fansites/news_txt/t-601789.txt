Boubouille2007-08-24, 04:28 PMThat's official. Sunwell Plateau will be the next 25 Man raid. And if I understand correctly it will also come with a 5-man dungeon including heroic mode. You can read the full interview on Actiontrip.com http://www.actiontrip.com/features/gc2007worldofwarcraftwrathofthelichking.phtml

And, also, this is something we haven't really talked about, so this is somewhat of an exclusive for you guys; Sunwell Plateau, which is an upcoming patch just before Wrath of the Lich King, we've announced that it's gonna have a 25 person raid instance. We will also be doing a 5 person instance which will have both Normal and Heroic mode.
