Druids Barkskin changes
Zolphea, a German Online Community Representative posted on the official forums and posted something that will probably make a few druids happy. 
German Post: Also an einer Terrorkatze wird, unseres Wissens nach, nicht gearbeitet.
Was wir jedoch planen, ist, Baumrinde mit Patch 2.3 in der Katzen- und Reisegestalt nutzbar zu machen.

Translated: Currently we are not working on a dire cat form. But what we plan is to make barksin availible in Cat and Travel form!
