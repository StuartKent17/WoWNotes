Boubouille2007-07-28, 09:12 PMWorldofwar.net  released a "leaked" schedule of the Blizzcon. The only interesting thing is the "Opening ceremony" which has 90% chances to be the announcement of the expansion. 

No further informations, doesn't really look like an uber internal leak but I guess it's better than nothing.


 

It also seems that World of Warcraft demo stations will be available after the opening ceremony what a surprise for 13 hours, which should be enough to test ... you know what.
