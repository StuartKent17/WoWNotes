As mentioned yesterday, we finally started moving the servers to Curse&apos;s infrastructure this week. We&apos;re still moving a lot of stuff and some pages might be down for a little while but ... we&apos;re there! It means we can finally start planning funny updates to the site, and, well, a lot of bug fixes. We also have a couple of shiny pictures, thanks to Xtek. <br>

Dual-Specialization Price Reduced<br>
The price of Dual-Specialization has been lowered in a recent beta build, it now costs 100 gold and new players who reach level 40 should be able to afford it without too much problem. <br>

Character Selection Screen - Built-In Theorycraft<br>
In Cataclysm, the character screen will let you check easily how much of stat you need to be capped, calculations for Expertise, Hit Rating, and a few other stats are available. This will probably save you a lot of time when you try to figure out if you really need that extra hit on your shiny new epic. <br>

Build 12804 - Mount Hyjal Update<br>
Mount Hyjal received a very interesting update in the latest beta build. If you visited the zone or looked at screenshots during early beta, you probably remember the huge crater called Archimonde&apos;s Vengeance. Well, this subzone is gone and has been replaced with a greatly improved version! The crater is no longer there but the key NPCs of the questlines are still around. <br>
