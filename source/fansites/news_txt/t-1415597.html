WoWSocial Addon (China Only)<br>
A nice new Group Finder feature is coming in Warlords of Draenor, but NetEase has come up with a solution for Chinese players to use today. Players in China are currently testing an addon that allows for group chats, creating groups, and scheduled events with cross realm players. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately the addon won&apos;t work on US/EU servers in its current state, as it relies on passing messages between servers via officially run characters that serve as message passing proxies. <br>

<br>

Warlords of Draenor Professions<br>
We&apos;re actually hoping to do a bunch of work with crafting in Warlords. Nothing I can share any concrete details on yet, but we&apos;re talking about it a lot. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/283713-crafting/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2794650466?page=1#8))<br>
<br>
Raid Finder and Group Browser<br>
So my question becomes are they seriously doing away with the current LFD/LFR system that is in place for WoD, or am I totally misunderstanding this. <br>
We&apos;re not getting rid of LFR or LFD. We&apos;re just creating an easier way for players who want to do content without random matchmaking to find other players. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/283644-so-waitlfd-lfr-are-going-away/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10786718969?page=2#27))<br>
<br>
Indirect Flight Paths<br>
Ok Blizzard. Please create direct flight paths. Seriously stop wasting our time with connecting flights and slow flight path speeds. This isn&apos;t real life, you aren&apos;t losing money every time a flight path takes off half empty... PLEASE PLEASE just make direct flights and speed this [fluffy bunny] up. Your just wasting our time on these 5 min flights. That is why people stop playing, poor customer design and input.<br>
We&apos;ve said it in the past, but I&apos;ll repeat it here. If there are bad flight paths that just don&apos;t make sense, let us know. We can always take a look at them. We also plan to make sure the flight paths and transportation in Warlords of Draenor is as convenient as possible as well. We don&apos;t plan to remove the feeling of traveling feeling like traveling still though. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/283530-direct-flight-paths-please/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10787478968?page=1#9))<br>

Ghostcrawler&apos;s Tweets<br>
Today was Ghostcrawler&apos;s last day at Blizzard, but he can still be found on Twitter at OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/).<br>
Ghostcrawler&apos;s Departure<br>
I&apos;m not surprised the internet doesn&apos;t actually understand what my job was. I am surprised it is so certain in its bad assumptions. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406133865258819584))<br>
To be fair you&apos;ve not done a whole lot to help dispell the myths.<br>
Really? I am always careful to say &quot;we&quot; when describing a new feature or game change that the design team is going to make. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406628709353783296))<br>
We&apos;ve always assumed it was the royal &quot;we&quot; <br>
Lol. No wonder MMOC posters think I&apos;m arrogant. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406877990262276096))<br>
<br>
HOnestly, I think the number of people happy he left are greatly exaggerated. Most people think it&apos;s a sore loss.<br>
I think that is true as well. In my experience the folks who feel they aren&apos;t being heard feel the need to yell louder. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408412420495769600))<br>
Doubt most players know who GC is and most do not know he is now gone. Not ment as disrespect btw.<br>
None taken, and I agree completely. Most players have no idea who I am, and many that do have no idea what I do. Just read MMOC. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408668154391326720))<br>
<br>
To be clear. I&apos;ve always said Chilton should be the focus of more peoples praise and ire than he&apos;s been.<br>
It is telling that the folks who communicate less are also less controversial. Don&apos;t reinforce that, internet! (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406882437818355712))<br>
<br>
I like this analogy. You acted as a lightning rod/tank as a direct public voice. I hope someone takes this up.<br>
I remember before I worked here the frustration of not understanding why design decisions were made. It was my goal to fix that. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406881805417988096))<br>
I knew a consequence of that would be some players not agreeing with the design, but figured that was better than not knowing. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406882026298425344))<br>
<br>
Obviously I didn&apos;t do it all alone. It took a large team to handle all the systems work. I just cleared roadblocks for them. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/405885494262652928))<br>
Systems design = classes, items, professions, PvP, encounters, UI, combat &amp; major features. I spent most of my time on features (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/405885252901433344))<br>
<br>
I figure that any kind of &apos;lead&apos; is akin to &apos;coach&apos; or Scrum master supporting the team and freeing them up to do their jobs?<br>
Exactly. I try to remove impediments that keep my team from being able to of their job. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406881058156601344))<br>
<br>
How much power does a Lead system designer have? example: guy 1 in ur team comes with an idea, can u then just turn it down?<br>
That&apos;s not a great way to foster good morale. Typically you should give them pros and cons of their idea and see what they think. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406875838118760448))<br>
Our feedback and playtesting processes are usually good enough to catch bad ideas before they go live. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406876049465565184))<br>
<br>
will you keep the twitter account, or will it be deleted?<br>
It&apos;s my personal account so I imagine I will keep it. I might change the name. We&apos;ll see. I certainly won&apos;t use it to discuss WoW. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/405885650840203264))<br>
<br>
Are you going to become a backseat driver, er, designer for wow then? Calling and telling them they&apos;re all wrong?<br>
I&apos;ll be ranting on the forums with all you guys. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/405885787993948161))<br>
<br>
Well ghost crawler if you are leaving I hope you have had a great time working blizzard<br>
I did. Blizzard is very much like a family. I made many friends that I will have for life. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/405886263011471360))<br>
<br>
If you&apos;re rly leaving...can I have your gold? Srsly though, thank you for years of hard work helping make WoW a great game.<br>
You wouldn&apos;t want my gold. Like all of you, we have to earn everything we get in game. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/405887184109969408))<br>
<br>
If you were playing a horde character, what race would you prefer?<br>
I&apos;m partial to the older-looking orcs for melee or female trolls for casters. Female undead tanks are cool too. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/405887821048594432))<br>
<br>
The real question is what race/gender?<br>
Human female. I&apos;m not judging, but I personally have trouble looking at a dude&apos;s butt for so long. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/405886897328648192))<br>
<br>
are you healing hc raids without addons ? I can&apos;t live without mouseover macros for all heal spells at the very least<br>
I try to heal without addons to get the experience and figure out what changes we need, but I certainly recognize their value. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407963719960764416))<br>
Now that you&apos;re no longer a dev, do you think you&apos;ll be more likely to use addons?<br>
Probably. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408033530044616705))<br>
<br>
BC class design was a ways off. I hated not being able to tank raids with my Pally which was supposed to be a tank too<br>
I played a Prot warrior at the time, and my guild only ran Heroic Shattered Halls with a pally tank and 3 mages. Not fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406153483826368513))<br>
<br>
shattered halls wasnt that big of a problem. The big problems with cc started in magisters terrace.<br>
I could tank MT fine, but by then we likely outgeared it. SH was an issue because we didn&apos;t have epics yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406155415274004480))<br>
<br>
Just resubbed after 2 years because Warlords got me so excited, sad to hear you&apos;re leaving, best of luck to you<br>
I&apos;m pretty excited about Warlords. I have high hopes. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406135448046551040))<br>
<br>
the real question is are you still gonna play? And what are you gonna insta level to 90?<br>
Yes, and I am thinking of leveling the Prot warrior who tanked vanilla or the hunter that was my first character. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407316181087817729))<br>
<br>
what will you miss the most?<br>
The meetings where I was just sure there was no good solution, and somehow we come out of it with a great idea. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406139141013778432))<br>
<br>
: What was your proudest moment at Blizz?<br>
Seeing a designer I really respect get a promotion. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406954464155664384))<br>
I&apos;m not sure there is design related moment. The experience tends to be more humbling than prideful. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406954724252872704))<br>
<br>
so was &quot;you can&apos;t have both good gameplay and good story&quot; blizzard&apos;s company line or your own opinion?<br>
I don&apos;t think I ever said that. I said &quot;Gameplay first,&quot; which is a Blizzard corporate value. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406151736672260096))<br>
Other studios value story first, or world first or social first. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406151814615015424))<br>
<br>
Some advice: [My pet issue] is why there were sub losses is one of the weaker arguments players use. Players don&apos;t have that data (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408353703616196610))<br>
i&apos;ve canceled my sub and the data you ask the person to provide is very VAGUE. too vague for ur supposed data<br>
But what if we looked at player history before they quit? What if we could that tell they used to PvP then stopped and when? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408668491881795584))<br>
Granted correlation is not causation, but with large enough data sets, you can still detect trends and form hypotheses. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408668636790804480))<br>
<br>
in your time at blizz what was your biggest idea/feature that never happened?<br>
I think it will still happen, so I can&apos;t talk about it. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406142877127806976))<br>
<br>
Any chance you can talk more about the &quot;big unannounced feature&quot; now? <br>
No, because I still want them to do it! (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406150254417821696))<br>
but you can talk about titan project?<br>
I guess they can&apos;t strictly fire me, but it would be in extremely poor taste. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406158245477117952))<br>
so other question are you was on the team of this game (developing)?<br>
I was only ever on WoW at Blizzard. I made very small contributions to other games when I could. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406159290353729537))<br>
<br>
One of my favorite aspects of your job, was the writing of those tips at the bottom of loading screens. True story.<br>
I admit to writing the Alleria and Turalyon one. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406143935027757056))<br>
<br>
Wait. Was Transmog you? Do I have to find you and hug you now?<br>
Everything we do is a group effort, but transmog was something on which I worked a lot. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406149997164376064))<br>
I had that feeling for some reason, which is why I think we won&apos;t get a Transmog Storage revamp now that you&apos;re leaving <br>
Nah, there is a ton of support for it on the team, which is usually what counts. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406160223699611648))<br>
<br>
Was it you who was responsible for the LFD? Even though it had its negatives, I found it to be one of the best additions!<br>
Many of us worked on LFD. I remember the development fondly though because I worked really closely with on it. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406503714149523456))<br>
<br>
Is there any idea you regret you supported to get implemented into the game?<br>
I wish we had done flex before Raid Finder. Flex still feels like raiding. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406954093123354624))<br>
was flex on thw radar when developing lfr?<br>
We&apos;ve thought about it for years. Balance was always the sticking point, which we finally solved by excluding the hardest level. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407618382167408640))<br>
<br>
so how much of the ToC patch in wrath was your idea?<br>
IDK. None of it? The raid was an attempt to see if good bosses could carry lack of new art. I feel like that was answered. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407208217337270272))<br>
Heh it was Daelo&apos;s first raid after he took over from Tigole right? He needs to come back to WoW already also !(Tigole)<br>
Your time frame isn&apos;t quite right. Daelo was the lead encounter designer for years and still contributes to WoW. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407622210191257600))<br>
<br>
How long have you been playing WoW? And do you have any rare mounts or mini-pets that you&apos;re particularly proud of obtaining?<br>
I started playing in the Mauradon patch. I&apos;m not much of a collector but there are a few rare drakes that I ride. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406505729978146817))<br>
<br>
I think he is going to design EverquestNext? Seems like the only big game in development thats worth leaving blizz.<br>
Not sure I&apos;d want to work on an MMO again. Anything would feel anticlimactic after WoW. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406134199876206592))<br>
<br>
Game designers must adopt the values of their studio to some extent. Somewhere else I would design differently. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406149567403421696))<br>
will we see you in the game designer position again?<br>
Yes, but my impression is less in the trenches work and more guidance. We shall see. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406152221256998915))<br>
<br>
Will you still attend Blizzcon?<br>
Probably as a guest, if I didn&apos;t feel it would detract from the actual developers. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406156565511544832))<br>
<br>
u can finally stop pretend everything is wonderful and perfect now! Gratz, Blizz can finally get someone serious<br>
I think you will find WoW design philosophy comes from the team and not any one individual. Don&apos;t expect many changes. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406504236873052160))<br>
I&apos;m just waiting for the rage posts, &quot;this happened because ghostcrawler left!&quot;<br>
Those tweets will come from me though, perhaps lessening the effect. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406558807012040704))<br>
<br>
with you being gone from the dev team, what kind of changes do you see might happen in wow down the road.<br>
Nothing drastic. Radical change probably isn&apos;t a good strategy for a 9-year-old game. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407214708559593472))<br>
<br>
Is someone going to get a post of Lead System Desinger?<br>
Not for me to say, but I suspect they will structure things a little differently for the time being. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407216726208561152))<br>
<br>
I wouldn&apos;t want to take credit for MoP if I was you either, it&apos;s far from a masterpiece.<br>
We&apos;re pretty happy with it. Still the fact remains that our game development isn&apos;t like a kitchen with some all powerful head chef. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407622732835086336))<br>
<br>
How important do you thing esports will be for a game to maintain longevity in the future? (esp they get more visibility)<br>
Depends on the game. Minecraft had no real esport. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406952168005328896))<br>
Minecraft didn&apos;t have much of a game to be frank. Still esports and the tight balance needed hurt variety in WoW.<br>
Not sure it was esport per say. Arena was easier to balance when we only cared about RMP. That didn&apos;t sit well with everyone else. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407212390959165441))<br>

Try to stay involved with the game community in your new job. I know it sucks a ton of time from design but it is appreciated.<br>
I love interacting with the community. I wouldn&apos;t want to give that up. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407214806895034368))<br>

Do you feel that with your comunication, you kinda spoiled the gaming comunity and set the bar too high for other companies?<br>
I don&apos;t know how much of that is on me, but if it encourages more dev communication with players, then it&apos;s well worth it. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407617577393737728))<br>

Do you think your Twitter &quot;experiment&quot; was a success? I think so! Thank you for taking your time to talk and hear to us.<br>
I think so overall. It has let me communicate with a lot more players in more regions than forum posts did. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408661887509725184))<br>
It forces players (and developers!) to be concise in discussions and nobody has the expectation of long diatribes. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408662085023719424))<br>
On the con side, I lose the ability to add caveats like &quot;the system isn&apos;t perfect&quot; or &quot;I see where you&apos;re coming from.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408662240695300096))<br>
And I think that leads to our answers sounding curt or trite or more certain than we ever really are. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408662386074058753))<br>

I hope you saved that tag for someone or to retire it! Would suck to see someone take it and say stupid internet things.<br>
Blizzard has the account name, and it will indeed be retired... at least until the inevitable reboot. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408713786174869505))<br>
