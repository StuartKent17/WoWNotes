Ion Hazzikostas - Warcraft Lore Interview<br>
Gameinformer had the opportunity to talk to Ion Hazzikostas (https://www.gameinformer.com/2018/08/14/a-look-inside-how-blizzard-maintains-world-of-warcrafts-lore) recently about how Blizzard maintains the Warcraft lore.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Loremasters at Blizzard take care of research requests, review publications and lore content for publishing teams, host lore seminars, and participate in story rooms and creative sessions.<br>
The team has a language and pronunciation database for specific phrases and terms.<br>
During Wrath of the Lich King development, one of the writers asked how to pronounce &quot;Ak&#x2019;agthshi ma uhnish, ak&#x2019;uq shg&#x2019;cul vwahuhn&quot;.<br>
It would have made sense for Krasus to be there for the Sinestra fight, but he had already died in a book, so the team had to come up with a new Red Dragon.<br>
Sometimes the team revises history, but only very sparingly and only as a last resort.<br>
Khadgar was much younger in the Warcraft movie than the team had imagined him being at that time. In The Burning Crusade he was much older and had a long grey beard, so the team went back and made a younger Khadgar model.<br>
Continuity exists to enhance a story, not to tie the hands of creators.<br>
