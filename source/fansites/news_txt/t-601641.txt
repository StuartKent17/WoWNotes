Utgarde Keep should be one of the first dungeon you can access, and the first wing will be playable at Blizzcon.
Horde players will be able to access Northrend by taking a Zeppelin in Tirisfal Glades, they will arrive at Vengeance Landing in Howling Fjord. This wasn't mentionned, but we can assume that Alliance players will arrive at Valgarde



Zul'aman

Loots will have pretty much the same quality as Tier 5 loots.
