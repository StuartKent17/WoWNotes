PTR maintenance is finishing up, and the servers will be coming back up within the next hour.<br>
<br>
There will not be a new build on the PTR today. <br>
<br>
Yogg-Saron Hotfixes<br>
We&apos;ve made one additional change to a specific element of the Yogg-Saron fight. Since the fight went live, there has been a hidden protection for players that prevents the casting of Psychosis and Malady of the Mind on targets with less than 30 Sanity. However, because Malady of the Mind has a slow missile speed and the hidden protection could take a second or two to apply, it was quite possible for the 30 sanity targeting threshold to be breached by these two random unavoidable effects.<br>
<br>
To try to address this we&apos;re raising the threshold to 40 sanity, and increasing the missile speed of Malady of the Mind. Note that the spells are still being cast just as often, so the net sanity loss to the raid will still be the same. This hotfix just evens out the random targeting of the spells across the raid. Also note that the threshold is for targeting purposes of those two spells only, and this fix means Psychosis or Malady of the Mind can still bring you below 40 sanity. If you have 41 sanity, you&apos;re a valid target and can then be brought to 32 sanity by a casting of Psychosis on you. <br>
<br>
PTR maintenance - 07/02/09<br>
Another maintenance, and most likely another build. Stay tuned.<br>
We will be bringing the PTR servers down for maintenance today at approximately 12:00pm PST.<br>
<br>
This thread will be updated once more information is available. Thank you for your patience.</div></div>
