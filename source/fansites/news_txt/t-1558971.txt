We’re here with a brand-new Artcraft! I’m your host, Chris Robinson, senior art director on World of Warcraft, and today we’re showing you where we’re at with the female Tauren.

The original female Tauren had a lot of issues with too-angular geometry and stretched-out textures. It’s not her fault—it’s just what we had available to us at the time. Our new process has allowed us to add a lot of detail to her hair, fur, horns, and hooves, to build a far more detailed and expressive face, and to add a lot of definition to her musculature while retaining her shape and silhouette.

One other change of note: Warcraft character design is commonly known for its stylized long arms, large hands, and big feet, but the female Tauren’s hands were just completely out of control. We brought them down to a more consistent size with the other updated models, and were also able to add a ton more detail and dexterity in the process.

We hope you enjoy her new look—let us know what you think in the comments!


Coming Soon: Spires of Arakk and Nagrand
In a soon-to-arrive build, we will be opening up Spires of Arakk and Nagrand, and will be raising the level cap to 100, leaving the entire level-up experience open for testing.

We have a close eye on the feedback that is being posted on these forums, and over the next week or two, you should see resolution for many of the major issues that you've been encountering in the currently released zones.

Please, keep the feedback coming. It is extremely useful in helping us identify issues that don't manifest in our internal environments, and your opinions on our content and systems are very important to us.

Thank you for all of your input and support.
