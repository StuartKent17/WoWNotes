Armory Stats - Character Item Level Distribution<br>
Today we are taking a look at the item level distribution of Level 90 characters. There are 5.5 million characters and 2 million accounts that were active after November 1, 2013 that make up this sample. Main character is defined as the highest item level character on an account. The All Characters category has been scaled down to 37% of its true value to be easier to compare to Main Characters.<br>

Classes<br>
I&apos;m so sad you are leaving. However unbalanced things are,I must thank you for making my paladin viable after TBC&apos;s horror.<br>
Things are pretty balanced. It&apos;s fine for players to like BC class design, but it wasn&apos;t balance they liked. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406137436805144577))<br>
things are not balanced at all what even<br>
They are balanced enough. You can play any spec and progress meaningfully in PvE or PvP. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406158042409861120))<br>
it&apos;s true but you have to walk a fine line between balanced and unique I felt classes lost a lot of unique sadly<br>
We do too, and that&apos;s one of the advantages of a larger mythic raid size. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406154094898737152))<br>
The alternative was some specs were just never going to get brought to a group, esp. a 10 player raid. Maybe would be better? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406140124494172160))<br>
<br>
I know correlation isn&apos;t causation, but when came in, Frost was relegated to PvP, and as he leaves it&apos;s strong in PvE.<br>
It was a philosophy change. Early on some specs were intended for PvP or PvE. I have no real objections to that model either. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406877883127173120))<br>
<br>
I never understood after dual spec was added why you guys didn&apos;t stop trying to balance pve and pvp and just have a pvp spec<br>
Some Frost mages and Sub rogues want to PvE with that spec. Not saying that&apos;s the best design, but that was the motivation. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406955240831737856))<br>
<br>
I thought it was added because bosses were winding up with some needing 2 heal and some needing 3.<br>
Dual spec was added because at the time, tanks and healers were terrible solo. That is less true today. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407210217852526593))<br>
<br>
Is it possible for stacked CDs give diminishing returns, so that stacking CDs has higher burst, but lower dps? Unintuitive?<br>
That is one solution. Another is just shared cooldowns. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407210343304151040))<br>
<br>
Real question, so don&apos;t laugh. You think they will ever let hunters/locks gear pets, example collars with stats ?<br>
Would there be sufficient gameplay there though? Wouldn&apos;t you just stack haste or int or your best stat? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407312844208631808))<br>
<br>
Making some classes deliberately subpar was not a great thing, but some old mechanics were better<br>
We&apos;re always happy to discuss old mechanics that you miss. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s e.g. short term blessings or Shadowbolt spam. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407619689490030592))<br>
<br>
Why is this argument acceptable for some things and unacceptable for others? The issue of ability bloat, for instance.<br>
Well for example, we changed talents and lost some players who preferred the old model. Same would be true of a large spell purge. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406878519247900672))<br>
Yes, but, in theory if the change was actually better for the game you&apos;d recoup any subscriber losses with gains, correct?<br>
Theoretically. But hard to argue that cutting 20% of abilities (for example) would directly lead to many new or returning players. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407623728881627136))<br>

Mana was never a issue and MoP hunter model was the worst yet. I think the LK/Cata hunter was much more fun<br>
I prefer the MoP hunter, but obviously it&apos;s subjective. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405082274560888832))<br>

I made a twitter account just to ask one question: do you not see a problem btwn Holy vs Disc. HPriest here.<br>
Disc is too versatile, esp. in 10s, and Atonement is too good at healing for no real mana cost. I&apos;ve said that for awhile. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/405885976557268992))<br>
<br>
Dear Greg.. buddy... from Hpriest to another Hpriest, let&apos;s do something about our mana regen<br>
I think it feels about right TBH. Mistweavers and Disc can get away with too little regen. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407619857421578240))<br>
<br>
g/f keeps telling me holy is terribad compared to disc. what makes you stick to holy? ps. armory link?<br>
Holy is fine. CoH and Divine Hymn can do things that Disc can&apos;t. I would agree Disc is too versatile, esp. in 10s. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407925931177562112))<br>

not sure this is your dept but why are rogue combo points still unique to the target and not the rogue like pally holy power<br>
Target switching was always seen as a skill test for the rogue. You can argue it&apos;s archaic, but that was the design. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406153939050958849))<br>
<br>
UI / Addons<br>
along with millions of others, thanks! One if the best game additions ever.<br>
Transmog needs a better UI and collection mechanic, but it will get one eventually. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406155140945559553))<br>
<br>
Have you considered making &quot;fire&quot; in raids easier to see like static neon circles/boxes where it would/is happening?<br>
Putting too many UI elements right in the world takes away from the world itself. It can look ugly. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407312282108960768))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
Any plans in WoD for improving the endgame for people who don&apos;t like organized raiding?<br>
It&apos;s something we discuss a lot but coming up with something fun and challenging has proven difficult. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407314719767134209))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
Currently its raid or die.. while there is a lot more the game should be about. Low level content was abandoned too early<br>
You mean like someone would go play a new level 40 dungeon? Or that leveling should be slower and less focused on finishing? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407619260165267457))<br>
<br>
Have Blizzard ever thought about releasing a sequel to an expansion? Like &apos;Wrath of the Lich King 2&apos; ?<br>
It&apos;s always a balance between revisiting things players remember fondly and avoiding that rehashed feeling. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408752674620715008))<br>
