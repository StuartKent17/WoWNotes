Character and Creature Nameplates<br>
We have made some changes to the way creature and character nameplates display in the game and would like to get feedback from those of you on the public test realms. There are three significant changes you should notice:<br>
<br>
The range at which you can see the nameplates is now much longer.<br>
You can no longer see the nameplates through objects which block line of sight.<br>
Instead of the nameplates trying to sort themselves, they just overlap. We think this makes them more useful for very large groups (example: Onyxia whelps).<br>
<br>
Please let us know how this change affects your play experience, whether through PvE or PvP.<br>
<br>
For clarification, please also refer to my follow-up post about nameplate changes:<br>
<br>
We have a couple of points of clarification based on some of the feedback and concerns we&#x2019;ve been seeing in this thread:<br>
<br>
As long as you are able to peer into the doorway of a room, you will see nameplates of players or creatures in that room.<br>
Similar to the first point, pillars and bridges in Arenas will not hide friendly or enemy nameplates.<br>
Nameplates for totems can be toggled under &#x201C;PRODUCTION&#x201D; settings in &#x201C;Interface Options&#x201D; on the test realms. We will look into adding this functionality for pets as well.<br>
The way nameplates are sorted when large numbers of creatures and players are grouped together is not fully functional and we will continue to address the way these are sorted and displayed throughout the testing process. In the mean time, you can choose to toggle this feature back to its original functionality, also under &quot;PRODUCTION&quot; settings.<br>

Pets scaling in Patch 3.3<br>
We&apos;re still working on it. One stat that will almost certainly not get scaled to the pet is armor pen. It is technically (for obscure reasons) challenging to convert the armor pen rating from the hunter to the pet. Given armor pen&apos;s not so rosy future (as a stat on gear anyway), this one probably won&apos;t get resolved.<br>
<br>
We&apos;d still like to scale haste, crit and just about everything else. We&apos;ll get done what we can. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20136603051-pets-scaling-and-33.html))<br>

New Nameplates and Arena Pillars<br>
It&apos;s not as simple as just LOS. The way the game handles LOS is a little more complicated than that. We&apos;ll try and get the thread updated, but Arena pillars should not prevent nameplates. Dungeon walls typically will. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20442614321-nameplates-no-longer-viewable-out-of-los.html))<br>

Scourge Strike and Unholy Blight in 3.3<br>
Scourge Strike doesn&apos;t work like Necrosis. There is no need to draw inferences from one to the other. If Scourge Strike benefits from EP and Black Ice on live, then the Shadow portion of it will in 3.3.<br>
<br>
All we did was change part of the attack to physical damage, which lets us increase the amount that it hits for overall. This means it should do more damage against lightly armored or fully sundered targets but less damage against heavily armored targets (assuming no armor pen). Magic attacks (even melee weapon swings) typically hit for less since they ignore armor. Switching some of the damage to physical let us inflate the number.<br>
<br>
Our goals were to make armor pen slightly more valuable to Unholy DKs and just make Scourge Strike and Reaping valuable to Unholy DKs. I understand many of you just wanted us to boost the numbers because you wanted for it to hit more, but under the way we balance it isn&apos;t fair for a magical attack to hit for as much as a physical attack.<br>
<br>
The nerf to Unholy Blight was in part because we think SS will be contributing to more damage overall. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20143783373-new-scourge-strike.html))</div></div>
