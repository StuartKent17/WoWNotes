Boubouille2007-05-24, 09:12 AMFirst, you'll be happy to know that The Lurker Below, Gruul, and a few other things have been hotfixed. 
A hotfix has been deployed that prevents Linking a Poison Recipe or Hunter Pet Ability in a chat message from causing a disconnect
A Hotfix was deployed that prevents Seer Olum from despawning too quickly after being rescued from the serpent shrine.
A Hotfix has been applied that prevents Coilfang Ambushers from being charmed.
A Hotfix has been applied that keeps the lurker in the water until all of the adds are dead.
A Hotfix has been applied that changes Gruul's hateful strike target to the 2nd highest on the threat list instead of the 3rd highest.
A Hotfix has been applied that respawns the gem vendors in Thrallmar and Honor hold.
