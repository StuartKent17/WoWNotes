We might see more progress on Anub'arak today now that a very annoying bug preventing guilds to access the boss after a soft reset has been hotfixed.
A hotfix has been deployed that will prevent the instance from entering a bugged state where Barrett does not spawn after a soft reset. If you haven't gotten to Anub'arak yet, you'll be fine now.

For those of you already afflicted with this bug in your saved raid, I'm still working on a method to correct the issue via hotfix for everyone so afflicted.

In the meantime, our customer service staff has been informed how they can resolve the bug for a raid with a bugged instance.
