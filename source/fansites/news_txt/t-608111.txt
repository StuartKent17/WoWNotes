Wrath of the Lich King Official Screenshots - Update
A few weeks ago we posted a few previews of Wrath of the Lich King, and with them we also added 14 official screenshots. Most of them were smaller than the original files to save some bandwith and I saved the full 1920px width resolution screenshots for later ... here they are.

Sons of the Storms to invade Europe
  has been updated with 3 artworks related to Warcraft and an announcement about the Worldwide Invitational
A pint-sized update for this month but included is an announcement for the upcoming Worldwide Invitational  to be held in Paris, France. As it turns out, only three Sons of the Storm will be attending the event: Samwise, Raneman and myself. The three of us pack enough Horde pride to resist any Alliance threat but with the entire gang together we could have totally torn apart the mean streets of Paris. Fret not! The future will definitely bring other opportune moments for us to be reunited and unleash our savagery...
