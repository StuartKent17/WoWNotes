Patch 5.3 - Transmogrify From Bank and Void Storage
Patch 5.3 adds the ability to transmogrify to items that are located in your bank or Void Storage without having them in your bags! The last update we got on Void Storage space was a no to more slots 


  


Addon - VoidTransmog
The ability to transmogrify from your Void Storage is already live, but not built in to the default UI. The VoidTransmog  addon allows you to transmogrify to anything currently in your Void Storage. 

You can open the Void Storage window when at a transmogrification NPC  by pressing the Void button on the transmogrify window, then selecting an item from Void Storage and applying it to the correct slot. The items don't appear in the normal flyout selection menu, so you must select the item and then slot.

Reputation / Questing
Any plans to allow players to complete dailies and other quests while in a raid group? Current design is annoying.
We would like too, yes. We just don't want to splash credit to the whole raid. Source 
This isn't rocket science. Group credit applies only to group even while in raid. Problem solved! Why so hard to understand?
1 We'd like for groups in raids to go away. 2 Easy to understand and easy to implement are not the same. Source 

So does this mean we can expect 2x10^10 dailies in every expansion from now on? and have those dailies gate everything?
Have you played 5.2? Source 
But why is every major patch "New dailies hub and..." but no dungeons. Seems like lack of creativity.
Production-wise, dungeons don't compete with quests or scenarios. Dungeons compete with raids. Source 

In vanilla, questing was what you did sub-level cap. Raiding level cap. Completely different now. Better? Unsure
In vanilla, you did questing. Then a tiny percentage of players also did raiding. Now most player raid at least LFR. Source 
Doesn't stop repetitive content from being repetitive.
I agree. All content gets repetitive. It's impossible to design content faster than players can consume it. Hence, repetition. Source 

can we have some more uses for Lesser Charms? I think I have approximately a zillion of them.
The use is intended to be that you can take a vacation on dailies if you so choose. Source 

Misc
Essentially, we want WoW to feel more like fine dining and less like fast food. Please donâ€™t take this simple analogy to ridiculous lengths. Source 
What about aiming to be a food truck? High end trucks can be a great mixture of convenience, taste, and atmosphere.
Love them, but they aren't that convenient. Here in OC the lines are always long. Source 

But sometimes, you don't have time for fine dining. you want a quick bite so you can do more important stuff afterwards.
And you can play WoW in very small chunks. You just can't achieve every reward in small chunks. Source 

the busy working person rarely has time for a fine dining meal though. Perhaps allow that person the ability to succeed
We try to solve that by letting you accomplish something even in very small chunks. You just can't accomplish everything then. Source 

soooooo are we getting giant talent trees again since this new talent system is like fast food 
I'd argue the opposite. The older trees had a lot of empty calories. The newer ones are like tapas - small with depth. Source 

Fine dining is more about the experience. You spend a little time there. You soak it in. Source 
In the case of alts though re flightpaths the same great meal gets boring and bland after having it over and over again.
I agree, but I'll refer to my comments last week: if your alt is so caught up that you don't need to play it, what's the point? Source 

How about making wow more like an amusement park, where there's a little bit of everything & you CHOOSE what you want to do?
In WoW, players tend to just pick whatever has the shortest line, not what is the most fun and then get grumpy about that fact. Source 

Don't let people's hate over certain features bother you too much. No one is holding a gun to their head and making them play.
It doesn't bother us. We just like to understand the feedback and in turn try and explain a bit why things were designed. Source 
We'll support playing the game almost any way you want. We won't guarantee that your preferred way is the most efficient way though. Source 

Why are hotfixes often implemented before being announced seems like it would confuse players
Getting a hotfix applied takes a lot of people. Making an announcement takes a lot of different people in different time zones. Source 
Sometimes we'd rather get the fix out ASAP even if the message lags behind. Not ideal though. Source 

wondering, what would you say are the top 2-3 changes to the SDLC that have led to increased patch delivery?
Better planning. More realistic schedules. More people it's hard to hire enough good folks, but we're getting there. Source 

I think "overly literal" is the better way to describe "too rational", imo.
Perhaps. It's this strange perception that if we get caught in a gotcha that we'll be forced to make a change. Source 

What mistakes? Mists has been a blast. My only complaint is I don't have time to do everything.
Here are a few at launch: G Lotus felt too mandatory. Progression / rewards at 90 were not clear. PvP balance needed much work. Source 


Computers - Setup of the Month by chaud 
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud  will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices  seem to have bottomed out for now, with almost all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. No new CPUs, GPUs, or SSDs worth waiting for are expected before late in the second quarter this year. RAM prices have been increasing for the past few months, so if you were thinking about adding RAM anytime soon, now is the time.

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 3770K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions! If you are interested in Folding@home, take a look in our team's thread
