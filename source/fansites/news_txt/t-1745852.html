Misc<br>
WoW was never a sandbox MMO. Its framing and &quot;themepark&quot; approach is a big part of why we play it instead of its competitors.<br>
WoW does what it does well, am I&apos;m not inclined to see it reinvented as something it&apos;s not. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/579800688307257344))<br>
I am interested in seeing the market in general explore other angles though, both as a gamer and as a designer. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/579800792787390464))<br>

Fan Concept - Garrisons Mobile App<br>
Sinfonianartist shared (http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/2zwg8v/mobile_garrison_proof_of_concept_update/) a mockup of what garrisons could look like (http://imgur.com/gallery/H2v6g/) in the mobile app. Keep in mind this is just a fan concept and that developers have said it is very unlikely garrisons will come to the mobile app.<br>
