Patch 7.0.3 Recap
If you are just coming back, be sure to take a look at the Patch 7.0.3 recap for all of the system changes made to the game. 


  


Artifact Weapons
Artifacts are the only weapons you will be using in Legion. 


Artifact weapons are specific to each spec. You will select one to start with and then can acquire the weapons for your other spec at Level 102.
Artifacts have a trait tree  that requires Artifact Power  to fill out.
The traits are mostly passive, powering up or modifying your existing class abilities. There are some activate traits that provide you with a new ability. 
Artifact Knowledge  provides a multiplier to your Artifact Power gains. Knowledge comes from completing work orders.
Relics  can drop or be crafted and are used to increase the item level of your Artifact, as well as granting another rank of a trait. 
Artifacts have five different models , with four color variations of each model. One of these models is hidden www.mmo-champion.com/content/318-Legion-Artifact-Weapons-Info#hidden.
Be sure to take a look at the Artifact calculator  to get familiar with your Artifact's traits.



  

  


Order Halls
You will want to head to your Order Hall to work with your Artifact, manage missions, complete a campaign, and more!


  

  


Legendary Items
There are new legendary armor items that can drop from many different sources in Legion.


These legendary items are mostly specific to a class and spec, with your loot spec determining which legendary can drop. 
There is no way to target a specific legendary item. 
You can only equip one legendary item at the start of the expansion. This limit will be increased as time goes on.
Each class has an Order Hall talent that allows them to equip a second legendary item.
Some level of bad luck streak protection applies to legendary items.
