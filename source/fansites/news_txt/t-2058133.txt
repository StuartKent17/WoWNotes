What's Not Coming This Week?
Mythic+ dungeons and raids aren't opening just yet, allowing time for everyone to level and gear up a little bit before the race is on.


The Emerald Nightmare raid won't be available until Tuesday, September 20 http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5925-Legion-Dungeons-and-Raids-Schedule-August-22-Hotfixes when Normal and Heroic open.
The Nighthold won't be open until early 2017 http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5918-Gamescom-Developer-Q-A-Warcraft-Movie-Additional-Scene, meaning that you won't be able to obtain the Tier 19 armor sets until then. 
Mythic+ Dungeons won't be available until Mythic Keystones begin dropping on Tuesday, September 20 http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5925-Legion-Dungeons-and-Raids-Schedule-August-22-Hotfixes.
The new PvP season doesn't start until Tuesday, September 20. You can start earning honor and unlocking Honor Talents http://www.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator at launch though!

Artifact Weapons
Artifacts are the only weapons you will be using in Legion. 


Artifact weapons are specific to each spec. You will select one to start with and then can acquire the weapons for your other spec at Level 102.
Artifacts have a trait tree http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/318-Legion-Artifact-Weapons-Info#atrait that requires Artifact Power http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/318-Legion-Artifact-Weapons-Info#ap to fill out.
The traits are mostly passive, powering up or modifying your existing class abilities. There are some activate traits that provide you with a new ability. 
Artifact Knowledge http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/318-Legion-Artifact-Weapons-Info#know provides a multiplier to your Artifact Power gains. Knowledge comes from completing work orders.
Relics http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/318-Legion-Artifact-Weapons-Info#relic can drop or be crafted and are used to increase the item level of your Artifact, as well as granting another rank of a trait. 
Artifacts have five different models http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/318-Legion-Artifact-Weapons-Info#appear, with four color variations of each model. One of these models is hidden www.mmo-champion.com/content/318-Legion-Artifact-Weapons-Info#hidden.
Be sure to take a look at the Artifact calculator http://www.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator to get familiar with your Artifact's traits.

Legendary Items
There are new legendary armor items that can drop from many different sources in Legion.


These legendary items are mostly specific to a class and spec, with your loot spec determining which legendary can drop. 
There is no way to target a specific legendary item. 
You can only equip one legendary item at the start of the expansion. This limit will be increased as time goes on.
Each class has an Order Hall talent that allows them to equip a second legendary item.
Some level of bad luck streak protection applies to legendary items.
