After the hunter ammunition changes, it&apos;s time for the Equipment Manager to be pulled out of the patch because of bugs. We can assume that it will be deployed in a minor patch after the release of 3.1 on live servers. (Again, nothing official about this)<br>
Certain issues were encountered with the upcoming Equipment Manager that could not be resolved in time for release with the next content update, patch 3.1. In order to ensure that this feature meets our standard of quality, we will be taking some extra time with the Equipment Manager and it will instead be released some time after patch 3.1. We understand that this feature is a widely anticipated addition and apologize for this minor delay. <br>
