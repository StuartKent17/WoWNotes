Warcraft Movie Marketing
Duncan Jones  recently talked a little bit more about the Warcraft movie and marketing it.


  

So lets chat. Ive got a movie coming out next year; WARCRAFT. Its based on a computer game of the same name but its pretty unique. We're trying to work out how best to let people who don't play the game know that this is a film they'll genuinely want to see. You know as well as I do, game to film adaptions have a checkered past, but Im proud of this beast. It's unique. Its something special. ManMadeMoon 

Tricky. Want to let the people who grew up with Warcraft know we are doing right by them & welcome those who don't know it at all! ManMadeMoon 

Well how far from the game does it lean? Is it a very loose adaptation or would fans find it rewarding on a different level?
Definitely the latter. ManMadeMoon 

Any worry long time Warcraft fans will be disappointed by any changes made to the movie?
I don't think so... But more importantly, Chris Metzen and the gang have worked with us right from the start. ManMadeMoon 

definitely for female audiences like me, not into games, don't even suggest it's a video game.
Agreed. Do you think the title itself would be held against it though? "Warcraft?" ManMadeMoon 

Can you say anything about how much is live action vs CGI?
I would say that we fit somewhere between Planet of the Apes, Fellowship of the Ring and Avatar. ManMadeMoon 

So many action films these days too, if trailers are just mash ups of attacking I imagine it might feel just like any another
Agreed. ManMadeMoon 

I take it you're looking for the best way to convey the uniqueness and specialness w/o giving the game away, then?
Yes. But there is a central conceit we're sharing right from the start. Its a story told from two sides. ManMadeMoon 

Thought Guardians of the Galaxy trailer did a great job telling non-sci-fi fans it was a film for them too. Good guiding star.
deffo worth a relook at how they did it. ManMadeMoon 

As a non-player, I wouldn't want to feel alienated from plot by trailers assuming audience knowledge of warcraft
VERY sensible. ManMadeMoon

World Event: Love is in the Air

Crushing the Crown: Fixed an issue where the Crown Chemical Company Wagon in Darkshore was not granting quest completion credit.


Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios

Blackrock Foundry

Gruul

Gronnling Laborer's Gronnling Smash ability now deals less damage.
Reduced the damage that Gruul’s Inferno Strike deals to 10-player raid groups on Normal and Heroic difficulties, but increased the rate at which damage scales with raid size. Larger raid groups should find the damage relatively unchanged; smaller groups will find that the ability now deals less damage.


The Blast Furnace

There's now a berserk timer for the encounter at the 13 minute mark.


Iron Maidens

Admiral Gar'an's Penetrating Shot no longer targets players who are riding a loading chain.
Fixed a situation where Tricks of the Trade Rogue or Misdirection Hunter could cause the Deckhands to go into evade mode.


Blackhand

[Requires a realm restart] Beginning with the new raid timer, Blackhand will consistently drop universal set tokens at the same consistent rates as other bosses in Blackrock Foundry.
If the Siegemaker's Fixated target dies, it should now Fixate on the closest target.
Cast time for Iron Soldier's Explosive Rounds ability should now be scaling smoothly with raid size and should no longer have breakpoints where the damage ramps up more than intended at 16 and 26 players.
In Stage Two, Blackhand now casts Marked for Death every 16 seconds up from 15 seconds.
Players no longer take falling damage upon landing after receiving Blackhand's Massive Shattering Smash.
In Stage Three, Blackhand's Attach Slag Bombs ability now prefers players that are not affected by the Impaled debuff.


Battleground and Arenas

Druid's Starfall and Sunfall no longer targets players that are capturing a PvP point in Arathi Basin, Battle for Gilneas, and Eye of the Storm.


Bug Fixes

Alliance characters that complete the Primal Combatant achievement are no longer being told to go to Orgrimmar to receive a reward.
Fixed an issue where characters that log out on the Deeprun Tram may be unable to log back in.

What more feedback could you possibly need? It was buffed by 50%. Add -25% reduced healing in pvp. Keep it instant. Done.
In 6.1, Saving Grace is 50% better and instant. It is then nerfed by 33% in PvP. Same healing + instant. Simply better than 6.0. holinka 
After testing, 54k on Live, 40ish on PTR. Looks like it is increased by 50% then reduced by 50%, not 33%.
check next build. holinka 

Character / Items
Coming in Patch 6.1: Elemental Rune  collected for the 'Might of the Elemental Lords ' quest will stack to 999. WarcraftDevs 

Concerned the new Piccolo is going to be another annoying item that interrupts eating/drinking, confirm it won't?
We've changed the way the item works specifically to avoid that. It will not interrupt eating or drinking. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
stupid question: does the ice nova change mean that it won't DR with poly anymore?
Correct holinka 

Garrisons
I'm a raid leader, and I built a Mage Tower to help my raid team get to raid. Did I just waste my gold? They can't use it?
Your friends will be able to use your Mage Tower / Spirit Lodge portals in patch 6.1! WarcraftDevs 

Does the patch note change wrt amulets/rings for tanks/healers apply to raids or just quests in Nagrand + Garrison missions?
Yes, it applies to all Garrison mission tokens, as well as raids and dungeons. WarcraftDevs
