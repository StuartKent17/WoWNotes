chaud2016-07-08, 07:03 PMWarlords Season 3 PvP Ends July 19
Prepare to fight your last battles of the season—Warlords Season 3 will end at 2:00 a.m. PDT on July 19, 2016.

After the season wraps, we will begin the process of determining eligibility for end-of-season rewards. If you believe that you’ve qualified for Warlords Season 3 PvP rewards, please refrain from transferring your characters to another realm or faction until awards are granted approximately two weeks later.

The next PvP season, Legion Season 1, will begin after World of Warcraft: Legion launches on August 30. In the meantime, all Honor and Conquest Points will be converted to in-game currency at a rate of 35 silver per point. Also, Rated Battleground and Arena matches will not be available during the break between seasons. We will confirm the start date of the forthcoming Legion Season 1 at a later date.

Please note that the end of the season does not require a patch to the game, and will occur automatically.

Your days are numbered—get out there and fight!
