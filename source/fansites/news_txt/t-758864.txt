Copied Test Realm characters are not copied with their achievement history in order to better facilitate the character copy process.


Classes: General

<ul>
<li>Many class talents, spells, and abilities have been overhauled, added, or removed.

<li>Many item and class stats have been changed or removed.

<ul><li>Each specialization has been reduced to a 31-point talent tree.
<li>Players will now get a total of 41 talent points to spend.
<li>Players will be asked to choose a specialization at level 10. Doing so will result in the unlocking of a spell or ability unique to that specialization, as well as one or more passive bonuses.
<li>Once a talent specialization has been chosen, players may only place points in the primary tree until at least 31 points have been spent there.
<li>The initial announcement regarding these talent tree changes can be found on our Cataclysm forum: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=25626290449&sid=1
