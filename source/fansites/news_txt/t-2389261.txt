Technical Raid Test – April 13th
The first Battle for Azeroth raid test is coming up this week!
On Friday, April 13th, we will be conducting our first raid test of Battle for Azeroth! The primary purpose of this raid test is to identify any stability issues that would impact normal raid testing. For the duration of the test we will focus on one boss and monitor the server’s performance. This will also be an opportunity to preview the Uldir raid and provide feedback on both the boss and the zone itself. This test is important to ensure build stability when we start full raid testing once more raiders have been invited to test.

Friday, April 13th

Zek’voz, Herald of N’zoth - Heroic Uldir
13:00 PDT 16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST

Q: How do I get into the raid zone?

A: In Boralus, Zuldazar, or Dalaran, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade III. in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.

Q: What character should I use to test the raid?

A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players' effective level to 120 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounters being tested. 

Q: How long does testing last?

A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we're satisfied that we've received that information for a given boss, we'll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.

Sorry for not catching this thread sooner--the change to Blackout Kick cooldown wasn't intended, and should be reverted in an upcoming alpha.
