<br>
The [item=20475] ([spell=43676]) is also available now, letting you use 5 charges to create [item=33803]. This let you create decent crafted arrows and of course, use a single slot to stock 5 arrows in your backpack. <br>
There is also an Adamantite Shell Machine to create bullets but I couldn&apos;t get the stats on the PTR, it seems it&apos;s not activated yet. (But it&apos;s also harder to get items, you know what I mean)<br>

<br>
<br>
Interface<br>
(1) Sorting of auction house searches has been simplified so you can only sort by one column, and automatic sub-sorts have been created for those columns to be as useful as possible. In addition, sorting is now done on the server so as you page thru results, items will appear to be sorted across the entire results instead of just the page you&#x2019;re looking at.<br>
(1) If you get a message &quot;Interface action failed because of an AddOn&quot;, this means that an AddOn interfered with the Blizzard UI in some way. To diagnose this, enter the following into chat &quot;/console taintLog 1&quot; and restart the game and try to reproduce it. If you reproduce it, you can quit the game and search through the file Logs\taint.log for the word &quot;blocked&quot; and mail the log to the author of the AddOn listed there. Once you have done this you can turn off logging by entering the following into chat &quot;/console taintLog 0&#x201D;<br>
All players now have a tracking bubble on their minimap. From that menu you can select a specific type of vendor or npc to look for or you can select a specific tracking type if your character has tracking. Yes this means that hunters can take all of those tracking buttons off of their action bars.<br>
There are now options for displaying health and mana values on your health/mana bars for you/your party and to display that information either as percentages or as numbers.<br>
When you are possessing a target (Priest Mind Control, Eyes of the Beast, using a Steam Tonk, etc), you now get their action bar as your primary action bar rather than having a mini action bar above your normal action bar.<br>
When an item drops that you cannot loot due to uniqueness or other factor, you will get a chat message letting you know what the item was that you passed rolling on.<br>
The raid panels that have been pulled out into the gamefield should save their option settings between sessions now.<br>
If a player is looting a corpse and there are one or more items on it that player cannot loot, the player will still be able to see those items (although not able to loot them). This only is for green or better quality items. The cases this should affect are for the profession recipes that only a player of that profession can loot or when master looter is on and there is a threshold or better item on the corpse.<br>
NPC&apos;s with level appropriate quests will now always appear on your minimap as yellow exclamation points. NPC&apos;s that have quests that you have completed will now display as yellow question marks instead of yellow dots. In addition flight masters that you have not yet gotten the flight point for will display on the minimap as a green exclamation point.<br>
Npc&apos;s will display an icon on mouseover that gives a more specific indicator of their function rather than just a gossip bubble. Questgivers will now show a question mark as their in game mouseover, Innkeepers will show a hearthstone as their in game mouseover and so on.<br>
You can now pull the list of players in a channel out into the gamefield by clicking and dragging the channel name onto the gamefield. This list will show all the players in the channel sorted by voice chat status.<br>
Voice chat will now display the nameplate for who is talking when you are in a chat group. Currently it only displays the nameplate when you are in a party/raid.<br>
When multiple people are talking in a voice chat session, it will show the names of up to four people who are talking at the same time.<br>
Many On Use items now display the cooldown in the item tooltip.<br>
<br>

Creature AI has been changed to no longer prioritize attacking unfeared targets over feared targets.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
