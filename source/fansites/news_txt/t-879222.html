World of Warcraft Patch 4.1.11 Preview<br>
Random Guild Finder<br>
<br>
As the popularity of the Guild Advancement system continues to rise, we realize an increasing number of players feel that the experience of finding an adequate guild continues to be daunting. To address this, we&#x2019;re introducing an all-new Random Guild Finder! Players may use this new feature to queue for automatic guild placement. You&#x2019;ll be placed with a random guild at the click of a button, allowing you to partake in whatever content they may or may not be doing. After being placed, you&#x2019;ll receive a cooldown which will not allow you to leave the guild, or for them to remove you from the guild, for fourteen days. Get to know your new friends! We&#x2019;re sure they&#x2019;ll enjoy getting to know you. If the guild you&#x2019;re automatically placed in does not exist on your current realm you&#x2019;ll be automatically charged for a paid realm transfer and moved there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Appearance Tab<br>
<br>
Acknowledging the continued requests of our players, an Appearance tab has been added to the game! The Appearance tab will finally, at long last, allow players to customize the look of their non-combat pets. Simply summon a non-combat pet and use the Appearance tab to change its look to that of any of the other non-combat pets you own. Summon, customize, and play!<br>
<br>
<br>
General<br>
<br>
Character armory profiles will now display current guild status: Solo, In a Guild, Looking for Guild, G-kicked, and It&#x2019;s Complicated. In addition, character portraits now have the option to be displayed as a self-taken cellphone picture from in front of a bathroom mirror.<br>
To ensure The Burning Crusade starting zones remain consistent with the rest of Azeroth, it is once again no longer possible to fly in Azeroth.<br>
Dance Studio has been removed from the game due to lack of use.<br>
Vashj&#x2019;ir is now 20% more disorienting.<br>
Players in capital cities will receive a 2-hour debuff &#x201C;Homebody&#x201D; that increases damage taken and reduces damage and healing given by 10% for every 10 minutes they&#x2019;re within city limits. We hope this encourages something.<br>
The mouse can now no longer be used to turn player characters. In many cases, this gave certain players a slight advantage over those that used their keys to turn.<br>
<br>
<br>
Classes: General<br>
<br>
Talents are now automatically chosen for a player based on the main specialization chosen.<br>
Due to player feedback regarding night elf, blood elf, and worgen &#x201C;flippy&#x201D; jumps, player characters can no longer jump.<br>
