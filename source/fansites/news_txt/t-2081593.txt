Outlaw Rogue Hidden Artifact Appearance
ixzo  was able to unlock  the Outlaw Rogue hidden artifact appearance! There are still some unclear details, but the process appears to be:


Reach Artifact Knowledge level 5.
Obtain the left binding from Dargrul  in any difficulty of Neltharion's Lair.
Obtain the right binding from Ash'Golm  in any difficulty of Vault of the Wardens.
After obtaining either binding, you can start Bindings of the Windlord  at Thrymjaris 
Obtain 10 x Infernal Brimstone  and complete the quest.
The bindings are not a guaranteed drop, so farming may be required.
