After battling their way through some intense qualifier cups, Europe’s top World of Warcraft Arena teams are ready to prove that they’re the best in the region. The Legion may have crashed into Azeroth since the last time they faced off, but these competitors will be ignoring the demon invasion in favor of PvP glory later this month.

We’re heading to one of the biggest esports venues in Europe, the Kiev CyberSport Arena, where eight teams will fight for a share of $100,000 USD.

What was the design philosophy behind the elite area of Suramar? It's super frustrating, even with a group.
Agreed the spawning is too dense right now, but it's meant as a group combat area. Lots of Group Finder parties for WQs there. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/780103230265044992
