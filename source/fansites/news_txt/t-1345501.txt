PvP Season 14 Begins
Season 14 is live in the US and EU, so get to work on your Season 14 Armor Set http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/373-Season-14-Armor-Sets! The new individual ladders http://us.battle.net/wow/en/pvp/leaderboards/2v2 are in place and updating. 
With sharpened blades and well-honed spells, the time to strike has come! Season 14 has begun, and the leaders of the Horde and the Alliance are once again looking for new champions to carry their factions’ banners to victory!

In PvP Season 14, you will no longer need to join or create an Arena team to compete, and thus the current Team Ratings will be removed. You’ll now be able to queue for an Arena match in groups of 2, 3, and 5 in line with the Arena team sizes available in Season 13 and earlier, and your opponents will be selected based on the average Match Making Rating of your party. Personal ratings have been reset.

You can find a complete overview of the changes in our Patch 5.4 Arena Update http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/10333782 blog.


Patch 5.4 Resilience Changes
The increase in base Resilience in patch 5.4 is meant to counterbalance the fact that Resilience is no longer on gear and thus does not increase as players gear up.

Prior to 5.3, players' survivability would naturally increase with gear. We didn't feel that that was creating an environment that would encourage undergeared players to continue playing, so in 5.3, we moved Resilience off of gear and increased base Resilience.

In Patch 5.4, we needed to do something similar. Since player power is still increasing as players collect more gear, we needed to once again increase base resilience to keep things from getting too out of hand. You'll still feel like your character is improving as you gear up, this just makes sure you don't improve to the point where you're able to kill someone before they have an opportunity to respond.

Conquest Vendors Temporarily Disabled
We're still working on a fix for the Conquest cap so the Conquest vendors can be brought back. I'll keep /poking for info but don't have anything new to share.

Raid Finder Difficulty
There are likely tweaks and fixes to be made here and there, but first week of any new LFR wing is like this as people learn the mechanics, and there are always threads like this.

I notice a number of people discussing about the difficulty of Norushen on Raid Finder. We're aware that the Look Within phase may currently be incorrectly selecting players; making the fight harder than it needs to be.

Legendary Meta Gems
If you're referring to the meta-gems awarded by Wrathion from The Crown of Heaven they will continue to work as those gems don't have a Sha-Touched or Armament of the Thunder King requirement.

However, there was a change in 5.4 while using meta-gems outside of the intended specialization.


Capacitive Primal Diamond http://www.wowdb.com/items/95346-capacitive-primal-diamond, and Legendary melee cloaks Fen-Yu, Fury of Xuen, and Gong-Lu, Strength of Xuen now have a 40% reduced chance to activate its effects for characters that are in a tanking specialization.


Which was a very lazy change. Tanks should have wanted to use the tanking items because they were better than the DPS options, not because they DPS options don't work normally for tank specs.
Good thing we also did this then.


Indomitable Primal Diamond http://www.wowdb.com/items/95344-indomitable-primal-diamond's effect now grants a 20% damage reduction to all damage taken up from only physical damage, and its activation rate has been doubled.

Proving Ground's NPC Party AI
We've actually been making several adjustments to the AI of the NPC party members in the healing Proving Grounds via hotfix. I don't believe all of the changes have hit yet as I write this, but if all goes well, they should be applied within the next day or so. I'd recommend keeping an eye on the official hotfix blog for updates.

How much data after a patch do you need before you see a balance issue or it a case by case basis?
Case by case. For PvE, the first week has a lot of noise. Folks learning fights... overgeared heroic players gearing alts, etc. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378606971877744641

is it frustrating how much emphasis people put on tiny stat/dps difference rather than play their class well/correctly?
Very much so. If a spec swap nets you 2% dps and playing your chosen spec better nets you 20% dps, your priorities are off. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377201330403561473

There is no way you can buff destro SINGLE target damage without buffing CBolt, but CB is too burtsy in pvp. Solution
We can make CB hit for less in PvP if necessary. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378560151038345216

Hey GC, can you explain why Warriors are not allowed to transmog their 2h weapons to polearms?
The intention was that they could. We'll investigate. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378555466772541440

Character / Items
Legendary cloak contribution to overall dps: 6-8% from personal experience. Do you think that is too much ? People are asking
Is this for a specific spec or across the board? Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378554630474444800
Also consider players likely are playing sub-optimally on bosses they haven't really learned yet, inflating cloak influence. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378554890332557313

Folks, why do you - developers, keep making pve and pvp items with such a dramatic diff in ilvls? 522 vs 5720\2 ?
So that new / reroll PvP players can quickly get from quest greens to Honor items to Conquest items. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378557045537918976

are timeless isle items with a single stat being weaker intentional? kinda frustrating using a burden and getting one.
Unlike normal loot, we cheated on the splitting rules for those TI items. They aren't weaker, assuming you like that stat. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378283326861082624

As I understand it, that's just how they work. More of a stat costs more. So 3x stats gets more total than 2x or 1x
Typically items with more kinds of stats are more powerful, but not the case for the double stats on the TI randoms. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378555750341029889

Raid Finder
It's just, for some of us, raiding - normal or Flex - is not viable. LFR is all we've got. It doesn't make us inferior.
*Totally* agree. On the other hand, we want to make the rewards for harder difficulties commensurate with their effort. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377941055988961280

-esque whiners who complain they aren't special enough. Punishing LFR runners by delaying SoO's end by almost a month
We have delayed the final wings of the previous incarnations of LFR. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377913978472525824
It's like this: we can't force LFR groups to wipe for a week before getting a new boss. So we just delay the later bosses. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377914107006951425
The alternative would be you blaze through all 14 on the first week of LFR and each individual boss doesn't even get noticed. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377914264620498944
