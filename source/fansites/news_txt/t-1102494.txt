Challenge Mode - Armor Reward Models Preview
The Dungeon Challenge Mode/Timed Runs introduced in Mists of Pandaria will reward players with new cosmetic armor sets for completing dungeons really fast! 



Mists of Pandaria finally introduces real models for belts! Those new belt buckles make some of the sets look amazing and you can see some of them on the sets below.
A lot of those sets are WORK IN PROGRESS, really. Some of them don't even have their belt buckle yet and I had to fight with bugs for a lot of them. They're early beta versions. 
If your class isn't listed, it means the set isn't in the game files yet, sorry. 


Some of those sets look definitely amazing and this is definitely what you want to wear in Stormwind and Orgrimmar if you want to scream to the ladies and to the world "I get it done under a minute!".
