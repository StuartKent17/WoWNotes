Brawl - Tarren Mill vs. Southshore
June 13–20 - Originally introduced as a part of the World of Warcraft 10-Year Anniversary event, this Brawl harkens back to the early days of WoW PvP, with an epic battle between the two towns of Tarren Mill and Southshore. In this game of war, you’ll need to work as a team and deplete your foes’ resources to claim victory.

We've identified an issue with the brawl's matchmaking that is resulting in most of the comments I see here. We currently have a hotfix in testing to resolve this issue, so hang tight!

Thanks for the reports here!
