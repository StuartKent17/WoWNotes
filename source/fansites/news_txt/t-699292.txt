Boubouille2010-03-03, 09:41 AM Death Knight - The change to Death Grip was "an unintended change as a result of a bug trying to fix something else. Death Grip won't change between 3.3.2 and 3.3.3."

Note about the Celestial Steed - A few people reported that on the official site, Algalon is the last boss of the Vault of Archavon  and assume that he will be available in this instance in a later patch. I would say that this is very unlikely, the official dungeons pages are greatly outdated Ulduar is still shown as an "unknown" raid instance without any information and this is most likely a very old error.

Update - Updated the PTR Build info.

Patch 3.3.3 - PTR Build 11623
A new build has been deployed on test realms, a couple of things have changed! As usual, these changes are from client data comparison and shouldn't be considered as final until they hit the official patch notes. Make sure you check the latest Patch 3.3.3 Notes Update

The Celestial Steed mount added in 3.3.3 got its own model and looks like an Algalon version of Invincible ... At this point I have no idea where the mount drops. 


 

The Celestial Dragon  had its model updated with a couple of new effects and looks very nice as well.


 

The Blazing Hippogryph  TCG reward for the moment, could change has been updated with a couple of new effect and the model used for Tiger bosses in Zul'gurub got a new texture, most ilkely used in the Echo Isles during the Cataclysm prologue event.


   

Last but not least, the multi-passenger rocket mount discovered in an earlier build now has 2 spells, it's not very clear if players will be able to use this mount all the time or just during some kind of event but the strange spell is probably just required to "mount" as a passenger.

X-53 Touring Rocket  - Mounts the target, limited to the outdoors, following normal vehicle rules. 
X-53 Touring Rocket  - Summons an X-53 Touring Rocket. This mount's speed depends upon your riding skill. 


 


Lich King 10 Heroic World First Kill by Paragon
The Lich King finally died in Heroic Mode! Paragon  finally defeated him in 10-man mode the 5% Hellscream's Warsong  was used for the kill. Congratulations to them! 

From Paragon 
We have now killed The Lich King on hard mode in 10-man Icecrown Citadel. Good job everyone who were on the kill and those who participated on the endless strategy discussion. 

This encounter had a bug on the spirit phase which we reported 2 weeks ago but it didn't get fixed untill today the bug made the encounter very hard. We had worked our way around the spirit problem on last week's reset and the kill was within our grasp even without any extra attempts or buffs. 

A video will be released on a later date tm.
