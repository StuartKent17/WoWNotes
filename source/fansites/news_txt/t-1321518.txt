Three new cosmetic items are now available on the Blizzard Store! Visit your friendly neighborhood NPC Transmogrifier to replace the look of your existing helm with one of these imposing pieces of headgear.


  

Recovered from the frozen battlefields of Northrend, the Crown of Eternal Winter enshrouds your character in an icy visage of death. Now you can adopt the look of an elite member of the Scourge, but without the inconvenience of undying bondage in the service of the Lich King.


  

Salvaged from the remains of the fallen minions of Ragnaros the Firelord, this helm sets you apart as a glowing beacon on an otherwise crowded battlefield. Where’s the rally point? How about by that guy with the RAW ELEMENTAL FIRE emanating from his forehead?


  

Forged from Fel Iron and shrouded in flames, the Hood of Hungering Darkness is a remnant of a rare dark magic only practiced by the warlocks of the Shadow Council. The lingering curse that keeps this headpiece burning is thought to be harmless, but feign demonic possession once you adorn it and see who dares to believe otherwise.

Each of these cosmetic items takes up your head slot, has no stats, and works across all races and classes. Visit the NPC Transmogrifier to replace the look of your existing cloth, leather, mail, or plate headgear.
