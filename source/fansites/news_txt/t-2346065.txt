Glory of the Argus Raider Achievement Complete
The Achievements Discord has completed the Glory of the Argus Raider http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11987-glory-of-the-argus-raider achievement both in the US and EU. 

The EU group was lead by Nightswifty https://twitter.com/Nightswifty and the US group was led by Yonexx https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/thrall/yonexx.

The Achievements Discord https://discord.gg/VTS4mFQ is a community where players can form groups for achievements and meet like-minded completionists. Groups often complete Herald of the Titans http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/3316-herald-of-the-titans, Show Me Your Moves Show Me Your Moves!, Glory of the Argus Raider http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11987-glory-of-the-argus-raider, and all other kinds of activities as well. Players are provided with roles that match their regions and factions in order to be notified whenever someone is organizing an event that they might be interested in, which makes forming groups much easier.

Legion PvP Season 6 Has Begun!
Legion PvP season 6 is here, and the Arenas and Battlegrounds are ready to host all contenders

Season 5 Rewards Reminder
If you participated in Season 5, please keep the following in mind to ensure you receive the rewards that you’re due:


Refrain from transferring your characters to another realm or faction until after Legion Season 5 rewards have been distributed.
Legion Season 5 titles and mounts will be awarded approximately two weeks after the season ends.


Faction Based Rewards
Don’t forget—end-of-season rewards are based on your faction. If you transfer your character to the other faction, you must have 50 wins after your transfer and prior to the end of the season to receive the reward. Please note that you must have 150 wins for Gladiator and Dominant Gladiator titles.

The Arenas and Battlegrounds await!
