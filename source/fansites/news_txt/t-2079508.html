World Boss - Levantus<br>
Don&apos;t forget to stop by and kill Levantus (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/108829-levantus) this week! There is a world quest (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43192-terror-of-the-deep) and potential for loot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/595-Legion-World-Bosses#Levantus)!<br>

Recent Warden Tower Changes<br>
As many players have noticed, we&#x2019;ve been iterating somewhat rapidly on the rewards and cadence of the Warden Tower PvP World Quests. We wanted to take a moment to explain what&#x2019;s happening, and why we&#x2019;ve been tinkering with them so much.<br>
<br>
Our goal for Warden Towers is that they should feel fun and rewarding, but still secondary to Arenas and Battlegrounds as an overall source of Honor. When Legion first launched, they were certainly lucrative, but so frequent that many players were earning the vast majority of their Honor by completing them. We tried to correct this by increasing the time it took for them to refresh, and reducing the amount of Honor they gave, but that brought us to the other extreme &#x2013; they were no longer a primary source of Honor, but they didn&#x2019;t feel rewarding enough for the time investment.<br>
<br>
With the latest updates, we&#x2019;ve increased the Honor rewarded for completing a Warden Tower back to 300, but they will only re-activate once every 24 hours. This means you should once again feel that completing one is worth your time, but you&#x2019;ll still need to look to Arenas and Battlegrounds for the majority of your Honor. Warden Towers should now be properly filling their intended role in end-game PvP progression.<br>

Weekly Bonus Event: Arena Skirmishes<br>
Bonus Events have returned in World of Warcraft: Legion, and the first is underway with a focus on Arena PvP. <br>
<br>
What Are Bonus Events?<br>
<br>
The Bonus Events system consists of a rotating schedule of different activities, currently scheduled to run each week beginning on Tuesdays. Each Bonus Event grants a passive bonus to a particular game activity and offers a once-per-event quest with a noteworthy reward for accomplishing a related goal. The in-game calendar can serve as your one-stop reference for the event schedule. The Adventure Guide also offers a direct link to active Bonus Events, allowing you to easily accept any associated quests.<br>
<br>
Sharpen your swords and reinforce your boards, because you&#x2019;re called to the PvP Arena for the hectic mayhem of Skirmishes.<br>
<br>
This Week: Arena Skirmishes<br>
All week, from anywhere in Azeroth, open the Group Finder (default hotkey: i), select the Player vs. Player tab on the bottom of the window, and then under Arena Battles, choose either 2v2 or 3v3 and JOIN BATTLE. You&#x2019;ll be matched up with teammates and provided with opponents to kill in the Arena.<br>
<br>
Look for the following all week long:<br>
<br>
<br>
Archmage Lan&#x2019;dalock near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest for you.<br>
<br>
Quest requirement: Win 10 Arena PvP Skirmishes<br>
Reward: A PvP loot box<br>
<br>
Passive buff: +50% honor gains from Skirmishes<br>
<br>
<br>
If you&#x2019;ve been looking to make some Honor gains, this is the week to do it!<br>

Raid Finder and Quest Chains<br>
It is intentional that the quests &#x201C;In Nightmares (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43520-in-nightmares)&#x201D; and &#x201C;Essence of Power (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43521-essence-of-power)&#x201D; cannot be completed on Raid Finder difficulty. That quest chain is intended to provide a cosmetic reward for participating in organized, non-matchmade content. As such, we wanted to keep this step in line with the previous steps in the chain, which require completing Mythic Dungeons.<br>
<br>
This restriction is specific to this quest chain, which has a cosmetic-only reward. Other quest chains, such as &#x201C;The Stuff of Dreams&#x201D; from the Suramar campaign, will be completable through Raid Finder. We&#x2019;ll be making some additional changes in Patch 7.1 to more clearly communicate when and where these restrictions apply.<br>
<br>
Thanks for confirming the inevitable. I&apos;ll be saving some money every month now, because I am done with this game. If this is intended and staying in the game, you just lost a customer. It is clear blizzard is clueless about their own game. I guess it&apos;s true, no King lives forever. Good luck everyone. Blizzard, you failed.<br>
Again, a cosmetic reward we are reserving for those who participate in organized, non-matchmade content.<br>
<br>
This is not something you, by any means, &quot;need&quot;. And &quot;needing&quot; it on every alt, doubly so. If you desire it, then organize a raid or join a guild that will put you in their raiding ranks and dedicate the time to obtaining the items.<br>
<br>
We simply disagree that these skins should be handed out without dedication and challenge.<br>
<br>
I appreciate constructive feedback and discussion on this topic, and will discuss what&apos;s here with the developers once it&apos;s had time to settle, but anything that says &quot;the world is ending&quot; or &quot;blizzard is killing their player-base&quot; because not everyone will get a cosmetic skin is a bit of a fallacy.

Cross-Realm Zones<br>
We&apos;ve stated this numerous times, but this is not new. CRZ has existed in Broken Isle zones since launch, however you may not have seen it active due to the amount of players leveling the same zone on your server.<br>
<br>
Cross-realm technology activates automatically. I suspect that you may be seeing people from other realms since LFR opened today, and many players are trying out that newly opened content (hence, less players in the &quot;world&quot;). It&apos;s also 3pm PST on a weekday, which isn&apos;t what I&apos;d consider peak-time.<br>
<br>
No. People are confused because CRZ has never before been active on current content. Pandaria wasn&apos;t CRZ&apos;d until 6.0. Draenor wasn&apos;t CRZ&apos;d until 7.0.<br>
We&apos;ve had a bit of a shift in philosophy here with this expansion; some of this shift was influenced by the implementation of World Quests across Legion content. This would explain why CRZ was turned on for Pandaria with 6.0, but is active in 7.0 content now.<br>
<br>
A bit of a larger conversation, part of which doesn&apos;t really fit a forum post from myself.<br>
<br>
Again, just to reiterate, CRZ is intentional, but it should be not be massively disrupting the world and/or day-to-day activities. Seeing players from other realms is normal, seeing thousands of them, not so much.<br>
<br>
It makes more sense now why it&apos;s happening so much after server restarts. People start logging in, CRZ code says &quot;woah there&apos;s hardly any people in this area, TO THE MERGEMOBILE&quot;, then goes and takes a nap for 8 hours before realizing &quot;hey i just put too many people together, oopsie-doodle&quot;.<br>
I can&apos;t say for sure, but in my head this makes sense.<br>
<br>
People are working, at school, or otherwise offline after our maintenance and restarts (Tuesdays, amirite?) - which would, in turn, activate CRZ.

PvP<br>
sorry if it&apos;s been answered but is the pvp trinkets not working in pvp intended or bug rn??<br>
intended. No trinkets, set bonuses or enchants work in PvP (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/779152175050010624))<br>
<br>
are artifact traits with %dmg increase after you unlock all 34, going to be useable in rated pvp? I hope not<br>
No they are not (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/779376592795480064))<br>
<br>
Is it correct to assume the prestige rewards remain the same throughout seasons? Such as the bronze courser mount will still be awarded at that level in the next season, and new mount at later levels?<br>
Yes. Current plan is to increase max prestige each season, with more rewards. Prestige level will not be reset until the next expansion. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/779433947981688832))<br>
<br>
Professions<br>
Nomi is giving me recipes I already know. Intended?<br>
There was a bug with rank 1 bacon, specifically. It will be fixed in Patch 7.1. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/779430477962719232))<br>
<br>
Any chance that Alchemists could see some love with a bottomless flask in 7.1? 500 Primary Stat?<br>
Probably not in 7.1, but the idea isn&apos;t off the table for the future. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/779430726563270656))<br>
<br>
I am no herbalist, still i get herbalism world quests. Probably a bug?<br>
This is intended, and will happen sometimes. Non-Herbalists can complete these quests using the Auction House, shoulder enchants, alts, etc. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/779431092990259200))<br>
<br>
Cooking, why do Legion Feasts take 300 stat food, to create a 200 stat feast? This devalues feasts incredibly<br>
A few reasons, but the biggest is that single-use food gives secondary stats, while feasts give primary stats. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/779433051734495232))</div></div>
