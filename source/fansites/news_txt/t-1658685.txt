Why on earth would you nerf BM when it was already terrible? Or is it an oversight that it got collateral nerfed by MM?
.That Kill Shot change has an extremely trivial <1% impact on Beast Mastery. With MM nerfed, BM should get some play now. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/542131895731892224
Problem is BM was already low.
.It's difficult to say anything conclusive UP or not about a spec that only 1-3% of hunters play in raids. Celestalon https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/542145416301527040

You realize Gladiator is still ahead of both arms and fury on ST right? Fury is close, though.
It's almost as if that was the goal... WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/542164932142190592

PvP
Changing previous tweet: Looking for feedback on extra damage debuff to tank flag carriers IN RBGs. Too much? Too little? Just right? holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/542003230557741056
FYI: In RBGs only, tanks take extra damage when carrying the flag. They do not in normal battlegrounds. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/542003498183688192

Seems like the pvp scene is lacking control of balance changes this expansion.

Lore
Morning Dave, is it possible to be both undead and demon? For example, Xavius died and his disembodied soul was separated from
Lorewise, I think so. In game terms we choose one or the other for mechanics reasons shackle undead, etc! DaveKosak https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/542430851909173248

Garrisons
Even with a barracks and level 3 inn, a person with only lvl100 followers often ends up with ZERO missions.
The intent was to taper off missions as you leveled so it felt like you had to check in less, but were more rewarded 1/2 Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/542193303848906752
In retrospect, missions are probably more fun than anticipated, it's good feedback, we hear you. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/542193761032228865
