We expect these free character moves to remain open until 11:00 a.m. PDT (2:00 a.m. EDT) on Monday, September 16. Please note that restrictions apply:<br>
<br>
<br>
A character cannot move if the character:<br>
<br>
is a guild leader.<br>
has active auction listings or bids.<br>
has mail.<br>
<br>
You may be required to change your character&#x2019;s name once you&#x2019;ve reached the destination realm.<br>
You cannot move a character to a PvP realm where you already have a character belonging to the opposing faction.<br>
This is a one-way, irreversible move. Blizzard Customer Support cannot monitor or modify a free character move.<br>
<br>
<br>
During periods of high usage, free character moves may take up to several hours to complete. This service may be closed at any time, without warning, should a destination realm become full. We strongly encourage players who wish to use this service, especially in coordinated groups, to do so as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
Thank you!</div></div>
