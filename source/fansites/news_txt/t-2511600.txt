Items

The Conch of Wa'mundi https://www.wowdb.com/items/163073-conch-of-wamundi now functions properly again in Nazjatar and in the deep waters of Kul Tiras, Zandalar, and Mechagon.
Fixed a bug that caused PvP reward items from Crate of Battlefield Goods to have a lower item level than intended when the item upgraded to rare quality.
Fixed an issue where some Legion quest reward equipment that upgraded to rare or epic quality were not increasing in item level.


Quests

Players can again turn in “An Old Scar” to MOTHER for completion.




Patch 8.2.5 - More War Campaign Conclusion Cutscenes
The Battle for Azeroth War Campaign conclusion had two other in-game cutscenes https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8752-The-War-Campaign-Finale-Cinematics that take place after the two main ones covered the other day. The first one below is the final scene for Alliance characters and Saurfang supporters. The second one is the scene you see if you remained a Sylvanas loyalist.
