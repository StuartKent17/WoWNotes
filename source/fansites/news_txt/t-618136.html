Owned! <br>
This uncommon Loot card offers the newest in victory flaunting. Used in-game, this card gives you &#x201C;The Flag of Ownership,&#x201D; and will tell everyone that you just bested your opponent. In addition to a special emote, you will literally plant a flag in the corpse of your fallen enemy. As if that wasn&#x2019;t enough, the flag flies a giant thumbs down, the ultimate in humiliation. <br>

Slashdance<br>
This super common Loot card gives players a stack of Party G.R.E.N.A.D.E.S., complete with targeting circle! Aim carefully at a glum group of characters and then throw your grenade. Everyone in the target circle will receive a one minute &#x201C;buff&#x201D; that causes them to dance &#x2018;til there&#x2019;s a smile on their face! Not only will all the targeted characters bust a move, they will also get to enjoy some streamers and confetti, making it a real party! <br>

Cold Weather Flying questline removed in final version<br>
Making it purchasable makes it easier for players to get. I understand you have 3 alts to feed and as each of them levels up they will get the gold to purchase it.<br>
<br>
We haven&apos;t given an exact total number of new daily quests that will be available in the expansion, but there will be more of them to do and along with all the new quests I don&apos;t think reaching this number will be an issue.

<br>
Avoidance viability in tanking<br>
Imagine a boss that hits 300 times a second for 1 point of damage. In that case, the avoidance tank with 50% dodge probably will avoid around half the hits per second, while the mitigation tank with 50% damage reduction will absorb half of every hit. It&apos;s possible the avoidance tank will miss his dodge roll 300 times in that second, but it&apos;s statistically unlikely. It&apos;s more likely that both tanks take the same amount of damage.<br>
<br>
Now imagine the very slow boss who swings once every minute for 25K damage. The avoidance tank will die if he ever fails to dodge twice in a row, but you are almost certainly going to heal him back up in between swings so that doesn&apos;t happen. In this other ridiculous extreme, the difference between mitigation and avoidance is also not a big deal.<br>
<br>
The streaky nature of avoidance is only a problem when you fail to avoid several times in a row on mobs that hit faster than you can heal, or when the hits can be really large. Without crushing blows, the hits will be smaller.<br>
<br>
The other problem with avoidance is when healers just can&apos;t get into the rythym of healing and overheal a lot, run OOM, or get caught by surprise. But that varies a lot depending on the skill of the healer and the types of spells. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10972067998-avoidance-dr-and-death-knights.html))<br>

Tree balancing and Unholy damage<br>
We have Blood, Frost and Unholy at pretty similar dps at the moment so I&apos;m not sure why Blood would feel underpowered for you guys. Bloody Vengeance alone gives Blood a big boost to white damage, while Frost really doesn&apos;t have much that can compete.<br>
<br>
Gargoyle does do nice burst damage, but that&apos;s at the expense of Unholy Blight usually, which in turn hurts your Scourge Strikes. But we are messing with Unholy now to deflate its damage a little. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10972027296-blood-pass-this-week.html))<br>
<br>
Blood-Caked Blade cooldown<br>
Yeah, I think it&apos;s a bug. We can&apos;t think of a good reason why it needs a cooldown at all. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10972017935-bug-bloodcaked-blade-10s-cd.html))<br>
<br>
Frigid Dreadplate<br>
We rewrote the spell and the tooltip to be simpler and less confusing. It&apos;s now just 1/2/3% less chance to be melee hit. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10971908849-frigid-dreadplate--is-this-talent-working.html))<br>

New Druid out of combat rez in WotLK<br>
We don&apos;t think an out of combat rez for druids is a balance problem. We did it to make druids more attractive healers for 5-player dungeons. It was frustrating for someone to die and have to run back nearly every time with a druid healing.<br>
<br>
The only possible balance issue that comes to mind is the druid who stealths into an instance and brings back the whole group to get around respawns. But really, that seems like such a minor concern compared to he major hassle of not being able to rez fallen comrades more often than once every 10 min, that we thought it was worth just making the change.

Upcoming hunter changes<br>
We probably are going to let Barrage affect Aimed Shot. We looked at Explosive Shot again and its damage seemed like a significant increase over Arcane Shot, but if Survival ends up low, then Explosive is probably where we&apos;ll try to make up the difference. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10971928119-explosive-and-aimed-shot-reevaluation.html))<br>
<br>
Master&apos;s Call not working properly<br>
Yeah, we&apos;re working on it. It&apos;s hard to tell sometimes with abilities that involve pet movement if the data are set up correctly and there&apos;s just a code bug somewhere (that may happen infrequently) or if the spell itself is just borked. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10971908326-gc--masters-call.html))<br>
<br>
Ferocious Inspirations<br>
I suspect it is supposed to be raid-wide. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10971928367-ferocious-inspiration-raidwide.html))<br>
<br>
Too much haste on mail gear ?<br>
We do put a lot of haste on gear. Part of that is because we don&apos;t have a huge canvas to work with. We can&apos;t put a ton of Strength and Spirit on hunter gear. Also, keep in mind that we aren&apos;t trying to make the best possible gear for you. We want you to toss out less optimal pieces for more optimal pieces. Finally, keep in mind that gear is one of the things we use to let players demonstrate mastery of the game. Making the decision of whether that new ring or belt is an upgrade should require a little bit of thought. That&apos;s what makes it interesting. But I will bring up the issue of haste and we can talk it over again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10972138500-feedback-hunter-concerns-civil-edition.html))<br>
<br>
Low dodge % in WotLK<br>
I seem to be having trouble coming up with a way to explain it that makes sense to you. We don&apos;t want you to have as much dodge as a rogue or a druid or a tank. If you have great offense and great defense then we&apos;re not sure how to balance you. We want you to run away when someone gets close, not stand and take the hits. Mages Blink or Ice Block or Frost Nova to get away from melee. We gave hunters Disengage to try to do the same thing. Note that we don&apos;t want it to be an automatic get of jail free card -- sometimes we want the melee to kill you. Maybe they still kill you too much, but it&apos;s hard for us to tell if that&apos;s a hunter failing or Retadins and Unholy DKs doing too much burst damage. Hunters without LOS issues seem to be able to kill stuff just fine, so it may be that is your Arena weakness and not melee getting up in your stuff. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10972138500-feedback-hunter-concerns-civil-edition.html))<br>
<br>
Wing Clip effectivity and mana cost<br>
It&apos;s still a 50% snare, right? The duration is shorter than Hamstring, but is duration really what&apos;s killing you? It&apos;s possible it&apos;s too expensive. We can look at that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10972138500-feedback-hunter-concerns-civil-edition.html))<br>
<br>
Disengage<br>
Disengage isn&apos;t supposed to remove snares. We do want it to move you the same distance whether snared or not, but that takes new code, so it will take a little while. We did recently lower the mana cost from 14% (I think) to 5%. It is off the GCD now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10972138500-feedback-hunter-concerns-civil-edition.html))<br>
<br>
Scatter Shot<br>
We talk a lot about making it baseline, but it&apos;s also a very attractive talent in one particular spec. It&apos;s hard to argue that hunters of all classes (except maybe rogues) need more CC. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10972138500-feedback-hunter-concerns-civil-edition.html))<br>
<br>
Aspect of the Viper<br>
We like the design of Viper overall. It&apos;s cooler to have to shift your strategy to regen without actually interrupting your ability to deal damage. (Maybe it fits the mage class better to go hide in a corner and build up mana again.) I think Viper works fine for PvE. But I do think it presents a problem in PvP when hunters just can&apos;t get their mana back. We&apos;re talking a lot about to fix this, but I am going to be very hesitant to promise anything because this forum tends to get pretty upset when we change our minds or otherwise don&apos;t deliver.

Future of Arms of Warrior not determined yet<br>
Go find one of those posts of the Arms warriors in Naxx stacking crit. Sudden Death, Overpower and Deep Wounds are up constantly. The dps is at the top of the charts. We&apos;re not sure what to do about it yet, because I don&apos;t think Fury is that high. Hardly anyone (maybe the hunters) is that high.
