Team / Personal / Matchmaking Rating<br>
Because of the way the new system works, there has been some question as to the purpose of each of the different ratings, so here goes:<br>
<br>
Team rating: Team rating is the primary measure of a team&#x2019;s skill during the course of its existence. Titles and arena points are based on team rating.<br>
Personal rating: Personal rating only exists to ensure that a player has participated enough on a team to deserve the benefits of being on that team. When personal rating gets close enough to team rating, we judge it is likely the player deserves the benefits of the team.<br>
Matchmaking rating: This rating exists to ensure quality match-making despite players changing teams. In addition, the theoretical mathematical foundations of the new matchmaking system allows this rating to adapt much faster than team rating and personal rating, making the entire system more correct. In our measurements to date, this rating has been quite precise in predicting the outcomes of future matches.<br>
<br>
One important point to note is that the personal rating currently converges towards the matchmaking rating instead of the team rating, which we realize can cause lot of confusion and frustration. We will be making an adjustment in the near future that will cause the personal rating to converge towards the team rating instead of the matchmaking rating, which should alleviate much of the current concerns. <br>
<br>
Same team, different Matchmaking Rating<br>
Partners on the same team can have diverging team ratings if their matchmaking ratings are different. As mentioned above, we will be adjusting it so that personal rating will no longer diverge from team rating and will instead always converge towards it. <br>
<br>
Team / Personal rating convergence<br>
Team rating currently converges towards the average of the matchmaking ratings on the team. Personal rating currently converges towards each individual&apos;s matchmaking rating. As such, the team rating currently ends up in the middle of the personal ratings of each member of the team, usually around the average personal rating of the team. As mentioned above, we will be adjusting this to keep personal ratings in line with team ratings. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/14697300427-new-arena-matchmaking-system-overview.html))<br>
<br>
Past Win/Loss and new ratings<br>
We included history from before the implementation of the new system in determining the matchmaking rating. If you or your partner played with another player before the new system, data from those games would also be included in your current matchmaking rating. <br>
<br>
My only question is if a team has a good MMR, but a terrible TR, why put them against a 1900ish team to lose 6, and the 1900 team win zero? <br>
This would happen if:<br>
1. They are matched because the first team&apos;s matchmaking rating is near the second team&apos;s matchmaking rating.<br>
2. The first team doesn&apos;t lose a lot because their team rating is lower than than the second team&apos;s matchmaking rating.<br>
3. The second team doesn&apos;t win a lot because their team rating is higher than the first team&apos;s matchmaking rating. <br>
<br>
Matchmaking rating on different brackets<br>
The matchmaking rating is separate for each bracket, and the matchmaking ratings do not interact between brackets in any way.<br>

AV Token in the Concerted Efforts/For Great Honor quests<br>
We stated a little while ago (I think) that we plan to add the AV token back to this quest (For Great Honor is the Horde equivalent) in the future. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14697630909-add-av-tokens-back-to-concerted-efforts.html))<br>
