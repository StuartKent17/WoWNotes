Quest #39985 


Archaeology Projects
Demonic

Flayed-Skin Chronicle - Different breeds of demon exhibit different behaviors between battles. Succubi, for example, have a tendency to keep detailed logs of their day-to-day activities. Their accounts are often lurid, almost always grotesque, and were typically written onto "paper" made from the skin of an enemy or a captive. Common. 85 fragments. [del] 1 sockets. 2 sockets.
Houndstooth Hauberk - A massive piece of "mail" chest armor, crafted entirely out of demonic hounds' teeth. The points of the teeth face upward and inward, making the armor impossible to remove once worn - that is, impossible to remove without tearing the flesh of the wearer. Common. 170 fragments. 1 sockets. 3 sockets.
Imp's Cup - Imps have to drink too, and many prefer to bring their own cup with them. Some theorize that an ancient imp-like race revered their drinking vessels as something sacred, and a part of that ritual remained even after they were indoctrinated into the Burning Legion. Common. 60 fragments. 1 sockets. 2 sockets.
Malformed Abyssal - The ritual to summon an abyssal is complicated, and often fails. When a failure occurs, a small piece of the demon typically remains behind, seething with a combination of latent demonic rage and despair at its own dysfunction. Ancient battlegrounds are littered with such stones. Common. 95 fragments. 1 sockets. 2 sockets.
Orb of Inner Chaos - Chaos does not come easily to all demons - some struggle with the ways of the Burning Legion. Those that did will often carried an enchanted orb that invoked the rage required of any good demon. It is not known how the orbs were made, or who made them. Common. 140 fragments. 1 sockets. 3 sockets.


Highborne

Nobleman's Letter Opener - As is always the case with letter openers, this is a completely useless tool, kept only as an excuse to have a murder weapon nearby in situations where it would be socially unwise to carry a dagger. Common. 100 fragments. 1 sockets. 3 sockets.
Pre-War Highborne Tapestry - Tapestries woven before the time of Queen Azshara's pact with the demons typically display a unique "under-over-over" style of needlework that has not been seen since. Common. 120 fragments. 1 sockets. 3 sockets.


Highmountain Tauren

Drogbar Gem-Roller - While most drogbar appreciated the rough edges of a raw gemstone, others preferred a smoother, rounder jewel. Rather than using standard gemcutting tools, they used a hand-cranked stone device, which tumbled the gems over the course of several weeks. These were typically operated by servants, slaves, or disobedient youngsters. Common. 115 fragments. 1 sockets. 3 sockets.
Stonewood Bow - The limbs of the bow are carved from a rock-hard tree wood, which make it nearly impossible to draw. Archaeologists disagree as to whether the bow was originally so hard, or whether the wood simply petrified with age. Either way, the size and heft of the bow suggest that it was only used by the most practiced of tauren hunters. Common. 105 fragments. 1 sockets. 3 sockets.
Trailhead Drum - Not all Highmountain tauren were hunters, but those that were typically commemorated their first kill with a ceremonial drum, stretched with the hide of their quarry. Most trailhead drums are made with rabbithide or foxhide. Hunters typically carried them for the rest of their lives. Common. 65 fragments. 1 sockets. 2 sockets.
