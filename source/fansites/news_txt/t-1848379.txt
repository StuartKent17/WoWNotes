Patch 6.2.2 Release Date
As you might have seen in the latest update to the 6.2.2 PTR Patch Notes, our current plan is to release Patch 6.2.2 on September 1.

Please keep in mind that this release date is not set in stone, as we are continuing to iron out bugs with 6.2.2’s content, including some related to enabling flight in Draenor. That said, we are optimistic that we’ll be able to have everything ready by then, so we wanted to share the current plan. We know many players -- us included! -- are excited to take to the skies above Tanaan Jungle and the rest of the Draenor continent.


Patch 6.2.2 Change Clarifications
Hail, hero of Azeroth! The time has come to acknowledge/address faction imbalance!
We recognize there's a problem. It's why we've been nerfing the Human racial and implementing things like Merc Mode. CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634045580503678976
merc mode doesn't help Horde. It helps ally queue times. You stated so yourself! 
It does help Horde, by giving Horde more people to play with.
Maybe...we'll see how that plays out. Horde rated needs bodies, which means people actually on the red side.
Also - and I couldn't say this an hour ago - we're buffing several Horde racials. aa https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634080044432752640

Would it not be fair to give a discount or maybe even a free faction change when massive racials changes happen like this?
The goal is not to push everyone over to Horde, just shore up some Horde racials that are underperforming. I'll ask about it, though. CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634081794107682817
and doing it in the current season is totally fine.

That would be underperforming in PVP Josh? as the top 10 progressed PVE guilds are all Horde.
Yes, in PvP. The racial changes have little to no real PvE impact. CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634083547221876736
maybe I'm just being cynical but I don't think 30s on Rocket Jump cd is going to have a major impact on the ladder.
To be honest with the listed changes I don't believe anyone is doing it to be goblin. Even if they're cool.
Sure. I also don't think that another 5% on Hardiness or Voodoo Shuffle are going to have any noticeable effect.
With a majority of comps relying on stuns to kill or silences blood elves and orcs will def rise to the occasion.
Yeah, maybe. IDK I still think Stoneform or Shadowmeld are really strong and easily on par. CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634086333095391232

Why not just get rid of all active racials and let people decide what to play based on looks/friends and not fotm.
We like racials. CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634084398950805504
We still like the actives, and disagree that they cause big problems as long as they're tuned appropriately CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634084398950805504
I guess issue is many horde actives offensive, all ally actives defensive. Some horde actives good in pve, not so much ally.
Maybe. That's an interesting point. I'll bring it up. CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634085331881431040

Will these 10% more 10% less in pvp be nerfs or will they deal the same as now in pvp. Wording is not clear.
+10% base, then -10% in PvP. So a very slight ~1% nerf to those abilities, but a buff to Mind Flay. CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634085162926518272

hey can you clarify the feral damage changes. does that mean it's unchanged in pvp?
Buffed by 20% baseline, then reduced by 20% in PvP, so a very slight ~4% nerf . CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634088240509616128

Would have been much better to have the cast time removed from War Stomp. Still suspectable to push back and DPS loss.
I don't think a 0.5 second cast is too much to ask for a 3-second AOE stun CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634102424622473217
But a 3-second silence gets a pass?
Stuns are significantly more powerful in more situations than silences. CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634104466510376960

Bring back the strong Will of Forsaken!
WotF is exactly the same as it was in Mists when everybody was undead CM_Lore https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/634105005511999488
