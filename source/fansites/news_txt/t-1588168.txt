Garrison Missions and Raid Loot Rewards
Garrison missions  that reward raid loot will take time to unlock, as you have to gear up your followers before they can start raiding. These missions reward raid loot from a difficulty one above the one you are currently running. Mythic raiders get mythic loot and <span class="money-gold" alt="g">1,000</span>. There are currently 4 missions for each raid difficulty, with a 2 week cooldown on each.

Garrison Missions and Followers
Off the top of my head, I'm really not sure what can be done to make the level 100 follower endgame more interesting.
Once you have followers at ilvl 615, the second tier of level 100 missions unlocks, at 630 the third tier unlocks includes missions with ilvl 645 gear for your character, and when you have followers at ilvl 645 the fourth tier unlocks.

The fourth tier is special in that they show up rarely, but they're raid missions for your followers that reward your character with raid quality loot of a tier higher than you're currently running. If you're doing LFR, you'll get normal quality raid loot, if you're running normal raids you'll get heroic quality loot, and heroic raiders will get mythic quality loot. Mythic raiders will get mythic loot and 1k gold.

These missions show up rarely enough that you won't be able to deck out your character in these items before the next raid zone shows up, but having a handful of them will give you a nice edge.

For the love of the Light, if we have a limited size army the size limit makes no sense in the context of making a fortress in a savage world, can you soften the blow of people who have become attached to their followers by sending them to Stormwind for rest and relaxation, relocating them to an outpost where they look pretty and don't do much, or something? "Dismiss" sounds very harsh and final and makes the commander out to be a complete jerk for abandoning loyal followers to the savage enviroment.
Yes we can. We're removing the concept of dismissing followers and instead changing to a limit of 20 active-duty followers that can go on missions. What that means is, if you're over 20 active followers, you won't be able to start a mission until you're down to 20 active-duty followers. Your followers that are on inactive duty still show up in your UI but marked as inactive, and don't lose any levels, progress, etc. One follower per day can be returned from inactive duty for 250g.

The nature of the tuning here is such that it's absolutely not going to impact any sort of cutting-edge progression racing during the early days/weeks of a new tier. It's more of a helping hand later on. And because the availability of these missions depends on your character's actual raiding progression, they aren't replacing or trivializing the importance of actually going into raids and killing bosses.

Without getting into exact numbers, being classified as a "Heroic raider" or "Mythic raider" or the like requires multiple weeks of experience in a given zone at a given difficulty. And if you're worried about the impact on gearing up for the next tier, an occasional chance at a random Mythic piece pales in comparison to the dozens of Mythic items your farm clears will be bringing in every week, with the ability to trade items around and target specific drops through bonus rolls. This will be a drop in the bucket by comparison.

Garrison missions or lack thereof aren't going to impact any sort of world-first or realm-first competitions. But this system does help keep the system relevant to a broader range of players, and as overall gear levels improve over the course of a tier.

Reminder: It's very hard for you to have much perspective about how under/overpowered your spec is on Beta.Buffs/Nerfs are good, not bad. Celestalon 

why are unpopular or disliked talents not being removed or made baselinein a weaker from? There could be something better ther
Because making them baseline is how we end up with bloat. We'd rather improve them than remove; they can still work. Celestalon 

what's the point of Resolve?I get Vengeance->Dmg->Threatglad that's gone btw.But why "getting attacked"->"better at survival"?
So that absolute effects and percentage effects stay competitive ie Shield Barrier vs Shield Block. Celestalon 

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Seeing notes for increase to 60 focus on Barrage go through but still 30sec cd?
Don't think the 20sec CD made it in yet, but it will. Celestalon 

Will Steady Focus apply to Focusing Shot as well? It currently doesn't seem to work with Steady Focus.
Yes. Celestalon 

 Paladin Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Seal of Justice is currently doing 2% less direct damage than SoT on beta and doesn't proc damage on Judgment. Intentional?
Intentional that it Judgment doesn't trigger it see Burden of Guilt. Unintentional that it's less direct damage than Truth. Celestalon 

Why make empowered seals when you guys got rid of warrior stance dancing? just means Paladins are now going to be Seal dancing.
That's the whole point of it, which is great for an optional talent. Celestalon 

 Shaman Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Totemic Vigor nerfed? Our totems are already a joke to kill...
Just a fix; it was missed in our original squish. Celestalon 

So yeah, that Lava Burst nerf, and that Earth and frost Shock buff. They're in a real odd place now. Any insight?
We likely buffed them too much. Theorycraft such as what has been doing is useful. Celestalon 

 Warlock Forums  / Skills  / WoD Talent Calculator 
Demo just lost 33% dps. Surely in no magical fairy land could anyone ever think that demo is overperforming by 33%.
It was. Celestalon 

Character / Items
I'm curious to know how much work it would take to make raid tier tokens function like Timeless Isle gear tokens. cc: @WatcherDev
They will work that way in Warlords. No more vendors - you can get your set piece on the spot. WatcherDev 
So if two warlock tiers drop and there's only one warlock will that other piece go to waste?
It'd still be a Conqueror token that drops. A priest, paladin, or warlock could loot and use it to transform it into their item. WatcherDev 

for a druid u could do 10hr duration and no cd and still would be worthless.
This should be fixed in 6.0 with the new transform system! Muffinus 
Does that apply to Shaman & ghost wolf as well? I love my Iron boot flask but losing the effect if I want to GW is no fun.
Yes Muffinus 

Will SoO gear still be upgradeable after 6.0? message would seem to indicate that.
Yes, your Mists gear will remain upgradeable. Draenor gear won't be. WatcherDev 

PvP
Yo bruh. is there any new battlegrounds for WoD?
Initially we're focused on making Ashran a great PvP experience at launch holinka 

there was some horrible fps lag issue in ashran last time I played it
We're doing a lot of optimization work on Ashran holinka 

chance for a pvp rare in Steel Strongboxes feels too high. Like 40-50% too high.
Do you mean like you're getting gear too fast or too much of the gear you don't want? holinka 
getting gear too fast. Every second box contains a rare pvp item.
There are two tiers of rare gear. holinka 

Garrisons
Are Garrisons Faction bound? Do I keep the Garrison I made on horde if I go Alli? Viseversa
You keep your garrison, and get the horde's version of the followers you acquired Muffinus 

yeah it would be nice to know if it is just Beta inflation or if that is the plan for Live
Work orders are currently massively accelerated for Beta purposes. WatcherDev 

Misc
is Iron Docks' geometry still broken in this build, or will we be able to access it again?
There are were two copies of the dungeon present, superimposed. Turns out the game gets really confused when we do that. WatcherDev

DLC #455  takes a look at some exciting PvP.
