Curse.com http://www.curse.com/articles/details/2625/ posted a video interview of Tigole on their site. Some parts are rather interesting. 

Raid composition in 10-man raid is definitely identified as a problem. Which means it will probably be easier to add hybrid classes to a Zul'aman raid
Arena powerleveling is an issue, and they're looking for a way to nerf it and equipment powerleveling in high-rank teams.
Item upgrade from BC to WotLK should be the same as WoW from BC. Basically, you'll get fast upgrades with an average gear, but people with equipment from the last tier dungeons will keep it for a while before finding a decent replacement.
Heroic Badges will drop from Zul'aman and Karazhan bosses. 2.2 or 2.3
A tons of items will be added to the heroic badge vendor. With items to equip for all classes and also enough items to fill the itemization gap for moonkins druids and retribution paladins



Shaman changes
We already noticed a few shaman changes during the blizzcon see the Blizzcon changes mega-list, Drysc posted a few more things about it. 

The change I believe you're referring to is that a new talent would be replacing the "Two-Handed Axes and Maces" talent. If that new talent does in fact go in - keep in mind these changes are in-development - then two-handed axes and maces would be trainable for all shaman. Please keep in mind that we may implement changes, test them, and then revert or wholly alter them.

Clarity Incoming: As far as I'm aware swords aren't being considered to be usable with a talent, or as a base trainable weapon type.
