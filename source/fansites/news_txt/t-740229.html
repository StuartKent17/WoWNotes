Tabard of the Argent Dawn<br>
Beloved though it is, there are no current plans to reintroduce the Tabard of the Argent Dawn. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26137026190/tabard-of-the-argent-dawn/))<br>

Naxxramas in Cataclysm<br>
We intend to keep Naxxramas hovering over its current home of Dragonblight. Moving the citadel back to the Plaguelands doesn&apos;t really fit in with our plans for evolving the story in that area for Cataclysm.<br>
<br>
[...] If we&apos;re going to develop content where you travel in the past to take part in some major piece of Warcraft history, we&apos;re going to try and make that content compelling and enhance the story of the expansion. Adding a level 60 version of Naxxramas to Caverns of Time doesn&apos;t sound very compelling or relevant to Cataclysm... &quot;Patch 4.1: Travel back in time to return to a high-end raid not applicable or relevant to the current end game, characters, or storyline!&quot; ;) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26137476303/lore-out-the-window-bring-back-60-naxx/))<br>

Past/Present Azeroth Phasing<br>
We&apos;re not phasing the entire old world into a past/present sort of scenario. The Cataclysm will bring about inescapable change for all inhabitants of Azeroth. We don&apos;t plan to phase a portion of the playerbase into some past world of Azeroth where environments, quests, and creatures are unchanged.

Effective Health in Cataclysm<br>
I&apos;m not sure that serious tanks will ever gem dodge or parry at the expense of Stamina to any great degree. As long as dragons breathe, there will be elements of encounters where health is more useful than avoidance.<br>
<br>
However, I think avoidance overall will still be more valuable in Cataclysm than it is on Live today when your healers risk running out of mana. The theoretical tank with a huge health pool and 0% avoidance should feel like a liability instead of the holy grail it is viewed as today.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re trying to shake [some] tanks out of the mentality that something is garbage unless it improves health or armor. That&apos;s not the same as saying that tanks will value dodge and parry and view health and armor as garbage instead. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968753168/eh-for-cata/))<br>
<br>
So it&apos;s the dragons&apos; fault. Why can&apos;t you give us something we can stack and get on gear which will reduce magical damage taken? Perhaps a &quot;mitigation rating&quot; which will reduce all damage taken, like resilience does in PvP, though at a rate less than armor or avoidance reduces physical damage.<br>
Couple of reasons. One, every boss (well, with a couple of weird exceptions) does physical damage, but there are plenty of bosses that do only physical damage. Second, we want the dragon breathing to be a scary moment that requires you and the healers to consider using your cooldowns. I realize the strategy of a tank is to try and do whatever you can to make those moments not scary, but as soon as you accomplish that, then the fights become a lot less exciting. Roller coasters that move slowly might feel more safe, but they&apos;re not as much fun. We have to nail that sometimes narrow line between letting you prepare for a fight without minimizing the danger (assuming its appropriate for your level of progression, etc.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968753168/eh-for-cata/))</div></div>
