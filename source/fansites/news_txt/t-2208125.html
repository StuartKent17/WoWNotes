Want To Run Your Own Tournament?<br>
We would love to see more of these! The more community involvement the better and there are some seriously solid reasons for doing it. Community-run tournaments directly impact which teams end up in the Arena World Championships, as all approved community-run events award points. If you&#x2019;re interested, here&#x2019;s what you should do: read the guide, fill out the application form (https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/QH7J0750E2KT1490206134230.pdf) and send in it to us. If you have any questions about running your own event, get in touch (wowesportsadmin@blizzard.com). We&#x2019;re here to help and want you to create as many community events as it&#x2019;s possible to have.<br>

Anduin&apos;s Questline - Where&apos;s the Horde part?<br>
Having been keeping tabs on this over the weekend I realise my original post really missed the mark. In my haste to post the details we received about the intent of the Anduin cinematic I didn&apos;t really do a very good job of addressing the points (other than AP) that had come up in similar discussions on the internet. It wasn&apos;t my intent to come across as disregarding, mocking, sarcastic or anything of the sort with my original post. I&apos;m sorry if it came across that way.<br>
<br>
We definitely hear that Horde players would like to see more story development for their faction following the events of 7.0, and likewise we understand that players of both factions are hungry for more story development in general. Both of those points were also included in the feedback we collated and forwarded regarding this topic, and will continue to be included going forward.
