Crucible of Storms Release - April 16<br>
The raid isn&#x2019;t at all part of their unlock requirements. Zandalari and Kul Tirans will be out the day the patch releases.<br>
Correct.<br>
<br>
Also, the current plan is for Crucible of Storms Normal/Heroic to open on April 16, 2019, and Mythic/Raid Finder to begin a week later on April 23.<br>
<br>
Battle of Dazar&#x2019;alor is still quite new &#x2013; a majority of organized raiders are working their way through their initial preferred difficulty, with higher difficulties to follow for many, and the final Raid Finder wing of Battle of Dazar&#x2019;alor just opened this week.<br>
