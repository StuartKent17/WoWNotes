Yay ! Weekend ! Slow news day. ! (But still, not that bad)<br>
<br>
2.1.0<br>
Endarion was nice enough to send a new screenshot with more new weapons. Actually i&apos;m not sure if all of them are new, but the 4 maces on the left are the Paladin &quot;tier 5&quot; reward, and the pink one at the top is a new Black Temple loot introduced in the last PTR update.<br>
<br>

Still looking for people to contribute with boss strategies. Use the contact link on the left if you&apos;re interested, or PM me. <br>
I&apos;ll start updating some page to reflect 2.1.0 changes soon.<br>
I fixed the boss strategies pages, it should look better for Internet Explorer users. <br>
I realized that the news still had a scrolling bar for Internet Explorer users, I&apos;ll make sure it won&apos;t happen in the future.<br>
Seriously, get Firefox. http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/</div></div>
