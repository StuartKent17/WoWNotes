Developer Interviews<br>
We&apos;re continuing to take a look at new information from the BlizzCon developer interviews. Automatic Jak (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj2YSBC-XiI) talked to Sigma at Blizzcon 2017.<br>

<br>
The team went into Legion knowing that they might have to revisit some of the classes that received major changes once player feedback was collected.<br>
There most likely will not be complete class revamps again any time soon.<br>
Mythic dungeons are a great way to show off each class&#x2019;s unique toolkit.<br>
The team likes classes having unique abilities.<br>
Going forward a big question is what unique abilities each class should have.<br>
The team wants to spread out class strength and weaknesses more.<br>
Utility will be spread out and balanced more in the future.<br>
Everyone should feel like they have some sort of cooldown to help them survive.<br>
The best thing the team can do to help showcase unique abilities is to have more variety in dungeon encounters.<br>
Talent tweaks and the future of the class artifact abilities are being looked at moving forward.<br>
The passive health increase on Artifact Weapons was essentially to also help healers heal into a set of players with higher health pools who take more damage that stays balanced with the amount of healing done.<br>
Thorns and other design elements are being experimented with more to counter the issue of healing getting boring as players get stronger.<br>
The team is pretty happy with where raid cooldowns are at now.<br>
Steady damage is important to the design of healing in encounters.<br>

Thanks all for another incredible BlizzCon full of excitement and hugs. I love this community so much! (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/927249082917142528))<br>
Was talking back stage with one of the convention organizers, who works on several big conventions... he said something that made me think. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/927249707511902208))<br>
&quot;You look at big cons like ComicCon, E3, GamesCom, ChinaJoy... those are for hundreds of games/things. BlizzCon is for 5 games [franchises]&quot; (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/927250368643268608))<br>
&quot;BlizzCon matches them in scale (with the new North Hall), with just 5 games. It&apos;s incredible.&quot;, he said. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/927250594854723584))<br>
It really is incredible. It&apos;s because of the people. The community. The FAMILY. I am so honored to have the privilege to contribute to it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/927251109948768256))<br>

In a creative industry, it&apos;s valuable to let your creatives take some time every cycle to work on whatever they&apos;re passionate about. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925209563141251072))<br>
WoW&apos;s level designers took on crafting the oceans of Broken Isles as a fun project once pencils were down for most of the world. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925210061835603968))<br>
I&apos;d encourage everyone to take a swim, you&apos;ll find all kinds of cool little moments, and giant pearls, and salty krakens, and passion/love. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925210325992927232))<br>
Plus it drives the Secret Finding Discord nuts so, bonus (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925222028403027968))<br>

I would consider everyone a creative - designers, artists, engineers can be creative, even producers with their multi-colored spreadsheets! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925224112590438401))<br>
Did you know that Gull Rock in Stormheim was created by a producer that wanted to see what would happen if he learned to add seagulls? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925224438387245056))<br>
The result was a LOT of seagulls, who were then eaten by Falcosaurs. Never forget the look he gave me when I told him they ate his seagulls (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925225275423571968))<br>
A combination of unfathomable sadness and &quot;did you have time for that, let me consult my spreadsheet&quot; (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925227433493544961))<br>
