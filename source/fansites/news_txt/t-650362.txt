Tauren Skin Tones changes in Patch 3.2
Tauren will be able to change skin tone using the barber shop when the new form art is released in the next major content patch. Source 

Patch 3.2 ETA
We don't give out dates or estimates on when patches will be released, but it will definitely need to be on the PTR for awhile before it will be released and since it is not up on the PTR it will be awhile. Source 

Adding content to the game
What this question is really relating to is something that happens during development of any content so I will try and give a quick example that hopefully makes sense.

Lets say we start out with 10 arbitrary number for this example things we want to implement. During the development we cut out 2 of them that we feel weren't as cool as we originally wanted, then later on, we cut 2 other things because we don't have the time for them and prefer to focus on the other 6 items. Just because these 4 things were cut doesn't mean they aren't in the game files in some primitive form e.g. blank spots of land, they are just things that players don't have access to.

Any content that gets cut is something we may end up taking a look at it again in the future, but only if we feel it is a good time and will be a be a really positive addition to the game. We are totally fine with putting it off for years/indefinitely hi Ravasaur trainer! if necessary too especially when there are new ideas that we feel are better and will add more to the game, even if it means going in an Outland-ish direction.

Argent Tournament
ETA on Valiant Quest Replacement?
Since this change will require a fair amount of work it won't happen until patch 3.2. And yes, we have more changes planned than just letting you do the valiant quests, a lot more changes really. Source 

Classes
Healer Mana Regen
We did recognize that healer mana was too potent in Naxxramas, and we did take some steps to fix it. Unfortunately, nerfing mana regen has two negative effects:

1 Healers feel really singled out. They feel like we are making the encounter tougher merely by making their jobs harder. Now, obviously when we think we need to make a change to the game we'll make it even if it upsets some people. However players having fun in their role definitely factors into that.

2 If raid-buffed mana regen is at acceptable levels, then it tends to be much too low when solo, in 5-player dungones and in Arena. This is not just a Replenishment issue -- there are plenty of stat scaling buffs that may not be present in smaller groups either.

I'll also add that high avoidance plays into this problem too. When tanks can dodge or parry 50% or more of attacks to pick a random number then bosses have to hit twice as hard when they do connect. Source

Lack of customization on new forms?
We do understand that it's taken us a long time to get out some updates for druid forms. Like anything else that has time to sit and be digested, we understand that most people want nothing less than everything they've ever dreamed or desired on an individual level. From a design stand point though, we have to make decisions we feel will have a moderately low negative impact, with a relatively high positive impact. We feel providing five different color schemes for two of the most outdated models for druids is a huge bonus. We feel strongly that druids will be happy to look at any of the five different color schemes for each form over the ones that currently exist once they see them in-game and have a chance to grow used to them. Source 

New Bear/Cat Forms colors
Much in the way specific physical features i.e. horns, eyes, facial shape, etc. found on bear and cat forms resemble the races to which they are linked, we feel it makes sense to tie the color schemes of these forms to the most identifiable coloring options of their respective races: hair color for night elves, and skin tone for tauren. 

Potentially more changes to forms in the future
Definitely. They just won't be done for the next major content patch. We plan to revamp all of the forms, and may continue to iterate upon the new forms coming out with additional color schemes, adding armor or additional customization, etc. Source

Warlocks in PvP
We are not happy with warlocks in PvP. Their Arena representation is too low. Source
