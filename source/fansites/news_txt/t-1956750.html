Legion - Nightborne Citizens<br>
In addition to the Nightborne (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4frZiYX-II), Nightfallen (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i933nMLZKI), and Withered (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i933nMLZKI) models we have looked at in the past, a recent Legion build added Nightborne Citizen models.<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
PvP<br>
With a revived tournament scene like and all of the PvP specific changes coming in Legion, I see a great future for our community. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/701521803827490816))<br>
<br>
Lore<br>
If a creature is from, relating to, or characteristic of, demons, it can be considered demonic. So why are people pretending as if Deathwing isn&apos;t demonic?<br>
what about an earth aspect maddened by old gods is related to demons? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/700855904741142529))<br>
but he wasn&apos;t corrupted by the demon, and the demon didn&apos;t even want to be inside of it, it was TERRIFIED of being shoved in there (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/700858441011572736))<br>
because what was really at its heart was an Old God (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/700858487266390016))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Mimiron is such a cool boss on hard mode<br>
Mimiron was awesome. But his red button was a little tongue in cheek and I think a literal button gets silly. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700148261487644673))<br>
<br>
It was insulting!<br>
I was attempting to explain the developer intent for the direction of dungeons. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700118678470176768))<br>
Specifically, that using a full action bar and relying on teammates makes the stakes higher and the accomplishment more rewarding (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700118847693533184))<br>
It&apos;s fine if you don&apos;t like that direction and want something else. You shouldn&apos;t feel insulted for that. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700118994540318720))<br>
<br>
I still don&apos;t get why LFR has to be so toothless. FFXIV duty finder is a tad harder and still works.<br>
When LFR was harder, it was a miserable experience. Folks would just wipe and bail. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700198051357437953))<br>
In ancient WoW you could rejoin the same AV that you&apos;d dropped 4 hours ago. Early LFR was almost that (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700198453591158784))<br>
<br>
because people struggle at work all day. The last thing they want from their escapism is more struggle<br>
I don&apos;t think that&apos;s universally true. A lot of hobbies are compelling because of the challenge: golf, hunting, marathons... (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700199202429624320))<br>
Maybe plopping in front of the TV isn&apos;t challenging, but that&apos;s also not really a game. WoW is intended to be a game, not TV (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700199453278343168))<br>
I get that maybe not everyone wants soul-crushing frustration, but we&apos;re still just talking about 5 player dungeons here. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700199651576709121))<br>
<br>
do you think engineers get enough limelight in the games profession?<br>
No, I don&apos;t. Sometimes their work is challenging to explain to players. Other times if it just works, you don&apos;t notice. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700361588226719746))<br>
