The basics<br>
Realm name: Blade&apos;s Edge<br>
Language: English<br>
Realm type: Normal (PvE)<br>
Battlegroup: Ruin<br>
Migration: No<br>
Realm forum: http://forums.wow-europe.com/board.html?forumId=5369079 (http://forums.wow-europe.com/board.html?forumId=5369079)<br>
<br>
Today we&apos;re opening a new English Normal/PvE realm, named Blade&apos;s Edge, in the Ruin Battlegroup. This is a fresh realm, thus no migration will be allowed to the realm during the first months, and the Ahn&apos;Qiraj gates are closed.<br>
<br>
The realm will open this afternoon / evening, after 17:00 Paris time (CEST).<br>
<br>
Please note that the starting areas may be quite flooded in the beginning, and the population cap is intentionally set a bit lower than normal to not have them even more flooded. The cap will be raised over the coming days as the population spreads out more. <br>

PvP in Wrath of the Lich King<br>
We&apos;ve also said that we are adding in more outdoor PvP objectives in Wrath of the Lich King as well as a new Battleground, a new Arena, and an entire zone (non-instanced) just built for PvP. I would like to think that those helping test all of these are going to give them thorough run throughs and submit some feedback on how to make these all the best they can be. We want to both encourage PvP and simultaneously allow for people to make choices on how and when they engage in PvP. For PvE realms, the availability and choices of when to PvP or not, is easy to figure out. On PvP realms, the chances of engaging in combat anywhere at anytime are still there. The choice to do so still comes down to players. If you feel that flying mounts cause issues when it comes to PvP, then perhaps you&apos;re one of the ones happy about the fact that flying mounts aren&apos;t going to be readily available for use in Northrend from the start. (At least that is the plan at this point in time.) (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=7736599448&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=4#71))<br>

Flying mounts in WotLK<br>
Well there&apos;s definitely no current plan to make people pay huge amounts to fly again in Northrend; opening the skies of Northrend to flight won&apos;t be the next big money sink. As you&apos;ve mentioned, at the Worldwide Invitational it was stated that we&apos;ll be able to fly our current mounts -- and I assume, Druid flight form -- at level 77. Regarding the &quot;defrosting&quot; that was referred to at the developer panel, it was pretty clear from the way it was mentioned that it was a relatively off-the-cuff remark, intended only as an example of one possibility to achieve this.
