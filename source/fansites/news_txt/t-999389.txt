Patch 4.3: Epic Gem Patterns
The epic gem pattern vendor appeared recently on the PTR, hiding inside some boxes in Orgrimmar. Along with the epic gem cuts http://db.mmo-champion.com/items/3/?level=85&quality=4, he offers a Tome of Burning Jewels http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71949/tome-of-burning-jewels/, which allows you to learn a random epic gem cut at the slightly discounted price of 4 Illustrious Jewelcrafter's Token http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52446/illustrious-jewelcrafters-token/ each.

Don't forget to continue doing your Jewelcrafting daily if you want to get the epic gem cuts http://db.mmo-champion.com/items/3/?level=85&quality=4 though, as they cost 5 Illustrious Jewelcrafter's Token http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52446/illustrious-jewelcrafters-token/ each and there are already 51 recipes on the vendor. Keep in mind that Ghostcrawler warned http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2459-Patch-4.3-Interview-with-Greg-Street-%28Ghostcrawler%29 that epic gems will only come from raids rarely, and maybe not even at all from the Looking for Raid difficulty level.
