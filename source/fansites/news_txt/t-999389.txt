Patch 4.3: Epic Gem Patterns
The epic gem pattern vendor appeared recently on the PTR, hiding inside some boxes in Orgrimmar. Along with the epic gem cuts , he offers a Tome of Burning Jewels , which allows you to learn a random epic gem cut at the slightly discounted price of 4 Illustrious Jewelcrafter's Token  each.

Don't forget to continue doing your Jewelcrafting daily if you want to get the epic gem cuts  though, as they cost 5 Illustrious Jewelcrafter's Token  each and there are already 51 recipes on the vendor. Keep in mind that Ghostcrawler warned  that epic gems will only come from raids rarely, and maybe not even at all from the Looking for Raid difficulty level.
