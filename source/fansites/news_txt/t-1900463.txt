Legion Class Preview - Demon Hunter
Demon Hunters aren't getting an official class preview with the latest series of blog posts so we thought now would be a good time to recap what we know so far http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1515-Legion-Demon-Hunter. Some of the information came from the gameplay stream below. 

It's fairly long and the front page is already pretty full, so we put it on it's own page. You can find it in the Legion menu in future!

Will you guys be putting thought into things like Gladiator and Fistweaving as potential 4th specs?
It's definitely an interesting idea that we'll consider for the future, but for Legion we're focusing on the current 36 specs WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665342970040684545

Any current plans for Death Knights Presences in Legion expansion, or do they remain a same?
Presences have been removed. They were mostly clutter, and negatively impacted gameplay when off-role Presences were used. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665342665530081281

Will Restoration Druids have Genesis in Legion? I love Genesis, especially for Challenge Modes.
Genesis has been removed. Instead, Flourish and the new Mastery will help in similar situations. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665343467480944641

Will we get an updated Aspect of the Pack for Legion? I hate having to find the forgetful hunter and tell him to turn it off
Aspect of the Pack will no longer bother you in Legion... WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665345157244456960

Wait, is Glyph of Regenerative Ice going away in Legion now that major glyphs are going away? Don't take our only self-heal 
Mages should focus on avoiding/absorbing damage. We don't like self-healing for them. Instead, we made Ice Barrior class-wide. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665341966876479488

Will the mage specs be more balanced in Legion? In WoD Fire was basically AoE only & bad for single target e.g. most of HFC
Previously, we favored some AoE niches between specs. We'll be toning that down for Legion. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665343195098705924

With Elusive Brew gone, what will Brewmasters use Crit for defensively?
We're still discussing exactly what it'll be, but are going to ensure that Brewmasters still value Crit. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665340986009096192

Clarification on the brew master keg? Is it just just the one on the end of the artifact staff or an actual keg?
Yes, the one on the staff. The base artifact's keg is a small bottle, but the alternate visuals have a much larger keg, like Chen. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665345574258913280

Will Light of the Martyr heal the caster if they have Beacon on them?
Yes. It's likely to be less healing than the self-damage it deals, but it does work. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665342160225472512

Say we have a Lei Shen transition phase. Healing to be done, but not really anything to attack. Do you see Disc being useful?
In these rare situations, Disc would use pure healing spells. It's less effective, but far from useless. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665342434625220608

About CP wasting for rogues. Anticipation is a huge help, but it feels like something like it should be baseline. Any plans?
Not planning to make Anticipation baseline. Minimizing wasted CP is a core Rogue mechanic. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665341278222061568
That said, we definitely recognize the ease of use it provides, so the other talent options need to be strong to compete. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665341354155773952

Could it be possible to allow Ele shamans Lava Burst precasting? So the dmg increase applies on hit and not casting? Please.
Possibly. Nuances like that will be evaluated in beta. Important to consider the reverse: casting LvB just before FS expires. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665344240365408256

Will Healing Surge still be instant after some MSW build-up for Enhancement? Would absolutely suck if not.
We're still evaluating that. It currently costs a variable amount of Maelstrom 0 to 20. May affect healing, cast time, or both. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665344644138401792

I keep hearing a lot about executes being mostly removed outside of Warriors. Will Doomguard's Doom Bolt still have execute?
Still evaluating. We're most sensitive to abilities which are only usable at low target health. Doom Bolt is different. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665340519736709120

Does Dark Soul still exist for Warlocks in Legion?
No. Instead, Doomguards and Infernals will be on much shorter cooldowns, and possibly stronger, to fulfill the same role. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665344454375505921

Not sure if this has been answered but, What about SMF for Fury warriors? I like using 1H's specially fist weaopns
Fury will strongly prefer 2H in Legion. We'll make sure you have appropriate weapons when the time comes. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665340815535792128

PvE
Will number of valor upgrades for 6.2.3 be the same for all regions? Last time they were different.
All regions have two upgrades. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665290300177297408

are the new CMs going to have a mob count requirement or are stealth runs back in business?
Yes. Kill count requirements are necessary to prevent shenanigans, but stealth is still a useful tool. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665300716060213248

PvP
Will honor and conquest points get wiped with the new season?
Yes, Conquest will be converted to Honor. All Honor over 4000 will be converted to silver at a rate of 35 silver per Honor. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665283947119570945

UI / Addons
simple ui request: option to outline my character like you can with target and mouseover. increase raid visibility of toon.
Done! A toggleable self-highlight for improved raid visibility is one of Legion's UI improvements. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665300937498464259


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
wasn't the PTR for WoW the same sort of thing? or any game, really. Never quite done adjusting and tuning things.
Raid testing on PTR was fairly good data because those teams had an incentive to try hard. PTR PvP feedback was never good data. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/661667489374298116

Still weird for me to see the WoW panel without Stockton, Chilton, Metzen or Ghostcrawler 
I think it's great that they're letting some of the other team heroes get some face time. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/662767256842076160

I'm sad they didn't announce any additions to the Black Market, how do you feel about the system? I hope for Naxx-40 weapons
I loved the black market. It was something I worked on personally at a time when it was hard to keep my hand dirty implementing. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/664268836774875136

Man I miss the class design in WoW when you were around, it was absolutely amazing has gone so down hill. RIP arms warrior
I am excited that the team seems to be doing bold things with class design for Legion. We shall see. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/662519863617781761
Arms got butchered. Friend is unhappy about Hunter. She is SV currently, and they're straight up removing it.
So it's cool to see them trying to excite players with bold innovation, even if it's too bold for some players. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/663729288542228481
I only forgave you last week for removing perma tree form in Cata. 
I mentioned this a few weeks ago, but is the druid fantasy a shapeshifter or an alt form class? OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/664268588224638976
Clarifying, do you mean should it shape-shift across all it's forms vs. stick to just one per spec, or?
That's right. It was clear that players had different opinions and was difficult to deliver on a design that met both. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/664445283351171072
