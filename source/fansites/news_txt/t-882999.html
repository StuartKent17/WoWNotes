The bonus reward will be displayed to eligible (system identified as least represented) classes within the UI.<br>
Once the dungeon is completed the eligible player will receive a goodie bag with various potential rewards including: gold, rare gems, non-combat pets, and (very rare) mounts.<br>

Several persistent ground effects now display different visuals for hostile and friendly players. The following spells have the same visual effects for friendly players, but new alternate visuals for hostile players: Ring of Frost, Consecration, Desecration, Wild Mushroom, Flare, Ice Trap, Power Word: Barrier, Smoke Bomb, and Hand of Gul&apos;dan. As a general rule, the alternate effects have a red tint or hue indicating they are created by an enemy player.
