Legion PvP Season 3 Ending June 13!
Tomb of Sargeras and Class Mounts http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6265-Patch-7-2-PTR-Build-23436-Class-Mount-Models will be coming soon, as well as the new PvP season!
The time is nearly at hand to bring Legion PvP Season 3 to a close for all Arena and Battleground competitors.

Season 3 – End of Season Rewards
If you participated in Season 3, to ensure you receive the rewards that you’re due, please keep the following in mind:


Refrain from transferring your characters to another realm or faction until after Legion Season 3 has ended.
Legion Season 3 titles and mounts will be awarded approximately two weeks after the season ends.


Faction-Based Rewards
Don’t forget—end-of-season rewards are based on your faction. If you transfer your character to the other faction, you must have 150 wins after your transfer to receive the reward.

When the dust settles, where will you stand this season?
