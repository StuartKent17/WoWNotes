Warning: Here be spoilers!* Go no further! Turn back now before it&#x2019;s too late! You have been warned!<br>
<br>
The distant echoes of the Iron Horde&#x2019;s war machine have already begun to reach the ears of Azeroth&#x2019;s heroes. Soon, the journey into Draenor will begin in earnest&#x2014;a journey filled with drama, tension, and momentous events that will shape the fate of this world.<br>
<br>
To tell this tale, we&#x2019;ve created more high-quality in-game cinematic footage for Warlords of Draenor than ever before&#x2014;and as your story unfolds, these cinematics will illustrate some of the key moments of your adventure.<br>
<br>
While we generally like to keep story beats like these a surprise, we know some players enjoy seeking out spoilers, and there are always plenty of people who find these files in the beta or on the PTR and share them. To help mitigate the potential for unsuspecting players to accidentally come across these and spoil their own adventure ahead of time, we&#x2019;ve decided to go ahead and upload them ourselves&#x2014;and provide plenty of caution and safeguards against watching them accidentally.<br>
<br>
Of course, it goes without saying that we recommend you wait and watch these videos in-game as they were meant to be encountered&#x2014;but if you choose to watch them here below, we hope you enjoy them, and only ask that you allow others to experience the story as they choose. Thank you for your continued excitement and passion for World of Warcraft, and we&#x2019;ll see you in Draenor!<br>
<br>
*What follows are the in-game cinematics that will play at various points during the Warlords of Draenor campaign. We encourage you to play the game and experience them in-context as you progress through Draenor&#x2014;but if you decide to watch them now, don&#x2019;t say you haven&#x2019;t been warned!<br>
