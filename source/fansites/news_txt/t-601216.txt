Thanks to Sacra who sent me a mail to warn that Fibb from the Seraphim guild on the Burning Blade-US server made a video of the Nether RAY mount. This is the mount you get as a reward from the Skyguards http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/210/skyguard_rewards.png
You can also get the high quality version on Filefront http://files.filefront.com//;7249787;/
