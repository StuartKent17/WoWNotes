Blue posts
Val'anyr Proc
If it helps to explain it, the blessing is triggered by healing being done. If you cast a heal on a fully-healed target, you are doing no healing. The bubble itself is triggered by a heal spell being cast. The proc then looks for how much your spell would heal and makes a bubble of 15% of that number. The amount actually healed by the spell isn't a factor for purposes of the bubble. That is why we tried to explain that hots that tick but don't heal cannot cause the blessing on you the healer but can contribute to the bubble on the target.

If the bubble goes down because it took enough damage or 8 sec have elapsed, then you next heal will cause another bubble for as long as the blessing lasts which is 15 sec. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137530621-explain-valanyr-please.html

Blizzcon Goodies Bag
I'm not saying we might not preview the goody bag at some point, but for now, we're not talking about what's in it. We'll save that for a later point in time. I don't have any information on specific time for the sales to begin. But we did want to make sure to allow for as many people as possible to be able to get to the site and try to purchase any available tickets.
