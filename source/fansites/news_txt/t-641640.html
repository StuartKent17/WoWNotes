I wouldn&apos;t jump to conclusions, but we can assume that April 14 or April 21 are the potential release dates for Patch 3.1. <br>
We are currently planning to end Arena Season 5 as early as April 14, or possibly a week after this date. At that point we will go through our normal process to determine who is eligible for the end-of-season rewards. This process should take approximately one week. It&apos;s very important for players who feel that they may be eligible for the arena-specific titles and/or Deadly Gladiator&#x2019;s Frostwyrm to refrain from transferring their character to another realm until after Arena Season 5 ends.<br>
<br>
The following Arena Season will not begin for at least one week after the current season ends. During this time between seasons, all rated matches will be turned off and only skirmishes will be available. When Arena Season 6 begins, all teams, personal rating, and arena points will be wiped, but matchmaking rating and honor points will remain. <br>

Onyxia&apos;s Lair attunement alliance quest chain<br>
This quest chain was intentionally broken with the story events that took place in regards to the return of King Varion to Stormwind. We also removed the need to be attuned to get into Onyxia&apos;s Lair. We want to fix this quest chain at some point in the future but there is no estimate on when that will happen.

Blood and Unholy in 3.1<br>
Blood dps has been too high for much of the PTR. Unholy is popular in PvP paritally because of all of the utility that tree brings. But a major portion of Unholy damage in PvP was in Icy Touch, and that spec has been brought down a lot. Unholy also benefited from things like Lichborne and Frost Presence which have been nerfed for DKs overall.

Razorice Resist Rate<br>
Item enchants sometimes have a bug where the item level (213-220ish in most of your cases) is used instead of the player level (80 for most of you) for purposes of resistance. Razorice had this bug. I believe it has been / will be hotfixed, probably just to make the debuff not dispellable to prevent it from being used to protect other debuffs.

Glyph of Backstab<br>
We recently fixed a much publicized rogue bug where the Glyph of Backstab interacted with Dirty Deeds to cause too much damage to stunned targets (basically attacks other than Backstab were benefiting). We were concerned that with this bug fixed, Subtlety rogues would suffer a dps loss. Therefore we changed Sinister Calling to increase the damage bonus to Backstab and Hemorrhage from 5% up to 10% with max ranks.<br>
<br>
This change is coming in patch 3.1, we have not hotfixed anything at this time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16019614893-glyph-of-backstab-bug.html))<br>
<br>
Sinister Calling<br>
It is technically not bugged if you look at the tooltip, which says &quot;percentage damage bonus by an additional....&quot; However that&apos;s a pretty confusing tooltip and leads to a bonus that is slightly low compared to what we do with most talents. The intent is that it gets to 198% so we&apos;ll make sure it does. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16019574852-sinister-calling-bugged.html))<br>

Fury Q&amp;A<br>
1.) Are you happy with warriors scaling up and down with gear at a much higher rate than most other classes? What would you do differently if you could redo 3.0? <br>
Warrior scaling has always been tough to balance around. The class suffers when it doesn&apos;t have enough rage and is too good when it is unlimited. We might end up (in the future) re-re-normalizing rage so that we can control the endpoints a lot more tightly. <br>
<br>
2.) Do you plan on balancing fury around Best in Slot geared warriors or more average geared warriors in Ulduar? How will this impact fury warriors in 10-man groups where their gear will always be lower quality than 25-man geared warriors? <br>
We don&apos;t balance classes against each other only by considering the best gear. Very few players have the best gear. It doesn&apos;t make sense to be balanced only for a very small percentage of the game. We do some balancing of groups against bosses by only using best gear though. <br>
<br>
3.) Will the devs ever consider scrapping TG entirely to revamp the fury tree and create a more balanced spec that won&apos;t be plagued by constant and drastic rebalancing due to scaling? <br>
I wouldn&apos;t ever say never, but we like Titan&apos;s Grip. It&apos;s very game-changing in the sense that you used to worry about acquiring one-handed weapons and now you need to think about two-handed weapons. Titan&apos;s Grip is not the cause of warrior scaling problems. Rage is. (And possibly the sources of damage from various attacks.)<br>
<br>
I know TG has something of a black eye among Fury warriors at the moment, but that is our fault for failing to balance it properly when LK shipped. If it had first shown up in beta with the current damage penalty and kept it the entire time, I think the talent would not be viewed as such a problem child within the community. <br>
<br>
[...] We didn&apos;t nerf TG to make warriors pay for wearing leather. We think Fury&apos;s damage was too high even in plate. Because TG was a gigantic dps increase for one talent point (maybe 20 to 30%) it was a good candidate to nerf. Originally we tried a couple of other penalties with TG, including a hit penalty, but that didn&apos;t work well. Ultimately what the talent does is improve damage, so toning down its damage felt like the right call.</div></div>
