CC in Warlords of Draenor
We are planning to take a strong look at CC in Warlords with the intent of dialing things back a little. We do think it's important that players are rewarded for using CC intelligently by coordinating usage, being mindful of diminishing returns, etc, but we think we can approach things in a way that allows us to tone down CC overall while still providing that gameplay.

Daze Effect
Oh man! Remember when it was based on Defense so tanks could essentially run anywhere and never get dazed but us cloth wearers would be in dazed-city? Crazy. Although they had to pay more repairs back then too. XD

Don't hear too much about it these days though, kind of a fun discussion to have again! In-general the world should be dangerous, and when you can ride through it unaffected, or have guaranteed escapes, it loses some of that danger. It's a lot of the same reasoning for non-flying in new content. Sure, you can still escape many situations, and there are still some get-out-of-jail-free cards, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea to remove all of the situations which cause you to be cautious, plan travel routes, and have to play your character in this Roleplaying Game. We think the daze mechanic still serves its useful purpose.

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/us-en.png Connected Realms Update
As previously announced, we’ve been working toward connecting realms to increase the number of players on low-population realms, and since then have completed several connections. 

Future Connections
We do not have a date for the following realm connections, but will update this blog post when we do.

Next ​​Batch

Andorhal and Ursin
Crushridge and Anub'arak/Chromaggus/Garithos/Nathrezim/Smolderthorn
Icecrown and Malygos
Quel'dorei and Sen'jin


​Plans for these connections may change at any time, but we’ll provide additional updates on specific dates for future connections here as we can. Please note that as a part of the connection process realm times may change to match each other.

Professions
Also if sockets that uncommon do you have plans to rebalance profession perks or just ignore for another expansion?
I'd like to cut them TBH. Not sure we can pull that off. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405463712347078656

I can't remember...were professions discussed with the instant 90s?
We likely need some solution, but aren't crazy about just "choose which prof you want at max." Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403952590204833792

Lore
Why are there no female Warlords of Draenor? You couldn't have come up with a single one?
Their identities already established in the lore. We could have replaced one, but that might have felt transparent. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401046106152251392

"Gameplay trumps lore." "We want to let you play with friends." So when can my gnome play with my RealID friend's blood elf?
Having two factions also produces good gameplay. It was a conscious decision not dictated by lore. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401043121384853504

so we got suspended from Heroes to Soldiers again. Feels wrong! Do you think about Lore when you make such Decisions?
We are crafting the story so hopefully you feel like heroes. That is why you are asked to return to the dark portal. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402535736651419648
That is why you command the garrison. If being heroic meant you could not be threatened, the game would be boring. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402535832772280320

UI / Addons
This is NOT a full group finder system. These are some moderate updates to the current system that people may find useful.
Takes our crappy old raid browser and enables some cross realm functionality. Still doing a new Group Finder for 6.0. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403632954120736768
To be fair, it needs to be a LFM and not LFG thus the need for oqueue. Hopefully blizzard realizes this
Random matchmaking and pug forming are two different and valuable features with different audiences. Source https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403952859902799873


Poll: Profession Perks
Taking a look at one of the more interesting tweets we saw today, Ghostcrawler suggested the removal of profession perks. What would you like to see change if anything with profession perks in Warlords? Share your thoughts and suggest more poll options or new profession perks in the comments.

Yesterday we revisited a poll http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3398-SoO-Progression-Heroic-Norushen-Changes-Blue-Tweets-Poll-PvE-Content-Fan-Art about the best world PvE content after many people suggested that the allure of Timeless Isle would wear off in a month or two, but it looks like the results are almost the same http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3608-Armory-Stats-Player-Raid-Completion-Blue-Tweets-Poll-World-PvE-Content-Fan-Art yet again.
