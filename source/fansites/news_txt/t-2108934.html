BlizzCon 2016 - Chris Robinson and John Hight Interview<br>
Chris Robinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson) and John Hight sat down with us at BlizzCon to talk about Legion!<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.twitch.tv/?video=v100077424&amp;!autoplay&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; width=&quot;900&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br>
<br>
New Caster Animations<br>
<br>
New caster animations are still in the works and the team is trying to figure out if they can use weapons for some of the animations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Legendary Items<br>
<br>
&quot;Will we see new legendary items in Patch 7.2?&quot; - &quot;Not per se. We do have legendaries that you haven&apos;t seen yet. Yes, you will discover things in Patch 7.2 that you haven&apos;t seen yet. As to whether or not you are going to find them before 7.2 drops, can&apos;t answer that.&quot;<br>
Patch 7.1 increased the chance that you will receive a legendary item if you don&apos;t already have one. <br>
Legendary items are special and when you receive one it gives you a story to tell. <br>
<br>
<br>
Class Mounts<br>
<br>
Color variants exist for the class mounts right now, so they may eventually show up if the team finds a place for them.<br>
Class mounts will only be usable on a character of that class. <br>
The team knows that getting the fantasy for each class mount right is very important. <br>
They talked to all of the artists on the team that would be working on the mounts and assigned the mounts to the artists that actually play that class. The artist was given the task of creating a class mount. <br>
The artists came up with concepts and came back to the team for discussion and iteration. All of the artists that did the concepts built the models and did the texturing. <br>
It wasn&apos;t someone unfamiliar with the class doing the work, but someone that was very passionate about it. <br>
Leveraging passion is something that the art team tries to do as much as possible. <br>
It is very clear when you are doing a piece of art if the artist was behind it from a passion perspective. <br>
Artists usually find a reason to be passionate about something they are working on, even if it isn&apos;t for their class or something they really enjoy they will go and dig into the lore and find what resonates with them and use that as their passion. <br>
If someone isn&apos;t feeling the art they are working on, they won&apos;t be forced to work on it, someone else can do it. This typically happens with tier armor sets that are very specific to classes rather than a raid or theme.<br>
<br>
<br>
Skeleton Reuse<br>
<br>
The Gronnling Mount skeleton has been reused way too much. <br>
It probably drives the team crazier than anyone else, as they want to do so much but have very limited time when it comes to animation. <br>
Animation is one of the most impacted areas when a new model is introduced. <br>
The team has to spend hundreds of hours to do all of the movement required for a new set of animations. <br>
With all of the costumes and transformations added to the game, they have to make sure those have animations so that things look right when you are transformed. <br>
The team has more characters that they want to introduce than they have time to animate from an original skeleton perspective. <br>
Sometimes they can reuse the skeleton and just do a new set of base animations to give it a more unique feel. <br>
Is it cooler to have something that is in and wouldn&apos;t have been done in the first place with a reused skeleton or just not do it at all? <br>
<br>
<br>
3D Armor Pieces<br>
<br>
The new 3D armor pieces will probably be expanded to other item sets beyond tier sets in the future. If they do a guard set for a new race in the game they can try to give it to players as a reward. These new models also allow the team to do non symmetrical armor sets. Shoulders can be asymmetrical as they are different models, but anything on the body had to be mirrored exactly before this. <br>
<br>
<br>
Mounts<br>
<br>
There are no plans to add more waterwalking mounts, as in Patch 7.2 you will be able to fly again and the Water Strider won&apos;t be the only mount many people use anymore. <br>
<br>
<br>
Weather<br>
<br>
The team is talking about how they could add weather that has a gameplay impact in the world, similar to the new battleground brawl. <br>
They could make environments that are very windy, causing you to be pushed a little bit by the wind or having to walk slower against the wind. <br>
The problem with that is players that go AFK are slowly pushed across the area. <br>
The team will continue to talk about how they can do it, as it adds more immersion to the environment. <br>
<br>
<br>
World Detail<br>
<br>
The team recently introduced height based fog. Previously the fog was a sphere around you, so any direction you looked in the fog was equal. Now the team can actually fill a basin with fog when you are looking down from up high in Highmountain. <br>
The detail on buildings far off in the distance is removed by using lower detail models, allowing you to see things farther in the distance. <br>
The team also did some significant memory optimizations in the base client for Legion, freeing up some resources. <br>
<br>
<br>
Model Updates<br>
<br>
The team looks at a lot of old models, such as the Death Knight&apos;s ghoul model and considers if it helps to push the story to update the model. <br>
The team tries to update models that can be an overall fidelity win for the game. <br>
The Death Knight ghoul is a good example, as once it is updated, the new model will appear everywhere in the world where there are ghouls. The likelyhood of that happening is higher than something that is a model just used by one class or in one place in the game. <br>
There aren&apos;t any plans to update skyboxes in older zones right now. The team tries to utilize the existing world in ways that make sense for the storytelling. <br>
The invasions allowed players to go back and see some zones that new players may have never experienced before. <br>
The team would love to go back and update these skyboxes and it could be done while maintaining the familiarity of the old skybox. <br>
They never want to change the world in a way that makes the player feel like they can no longer connect with the world they remember. <br>
In Patch 7.2 the team is going to update many different demon models, including some of the new ones created for Legion. The team wants to do more for shapeshifting and different forms, but it is a smaller subsection of the player base that plays that one class or spec. Spending a lot of time on that model means that a lot of time is being spent on something that not a lot of people are going to get to enjoy. The things that the majority of the playerbase will be able to experience come first, then smaller things. <br>
There are no plans right now to do more Druid forms in the immediate future, but it is something that will always continue to think about and do as often as possible. <br>
Varian&apos;s sword changed color (https://twitter.com/MMOChampion/status/789550592767172608) on the Patch 7.1 loading screen to match the in game cinematic. <br>
<br>
<br>
Alts<br>
<br>
Flying should make the game a little more alt friendly. <br>
Artifact Knowledge continuing to scale should also help to make powering up your Artifact on an alt faster. <br>
<br>
Social Queuing<br>
<br>
Social Queuing in Patch 7.1 is a little bit of an experiment. <br>
The team wants to continue to add more social improvements, but they have to be careful to make sure they aren&apos;t obnoxious. <br>
If you are in a huge social guild or have lots of friends, do you want to hear about every single person joining a queue? <br>
The team also doesn&apos;t want to clutter the UI with a bunch of checkboxes for fine tuning a feature. <br>
The team wants to reduce any of the friction preventing you from playing with friends. <br>
You might log in and miss joining a queue with your friend by a few minutes or have a friend that doesn&apos;t want to drop the queue they have been in for a long time to play with you. <br>
<br>
<br>
Holidays<br>
<br>
The Hallows End hats were not transmoggable because the team wants to encourage people to experience the holidays when they are live. <br>
If you could transmog all of your gear year round it would discourage interacting with the holiday when it happens. <br>
<br>
<br>
Class Changes<br>
<br>
The team has been watching how the class updates for Legion went and in Patch 7.1.5 they will be making some significant changes. <br>
Some of the talents that everyone is taking are going to be baked into the class. <br>
Things that people aren&apos;t using will be buffed or removed. <br>
These changes are all in the form of tuning and polishing, ensuring you have some interesting choices to make. <br>
<br>
<br>
World Quests<br>
<br>
There will be a lot more world quests coming in the future. <br>
The team is still tweaking the interface, making sure it is easy to read and you understand what you are going to get. <br>
The itemization system can change up the item or item level of rewards so that you never feel like you have a quest that you never want to do anymore because it isn&apos;t rewarding. <br>
Rewards will continue to remain relevant as patches are released, with the increase of item levels or additional rewards. <br>
<br>
<br>
Micro-Holidays<br>
<br>
A micro-holiday to honor fallen faction leaders is a good idea, maybe we will see it in the future. <br>
Micro-holidays take less development time than the older holidays. <br>
Right now the team is building some new systems for the micro-holidays, which is adding some development time, but these systems can be reused for the other holidays. <br>
It is a small team that works on these, usually creating them out of passion. <br>
The team is mostly using existing art assets, so they aren&apos;t creating a lot of new art. <br>
<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
<br>
There aren&apos;t any big updates for Order Halls in terms of art planned for Legion. <br>
Argus is coming in a Legion patch.<br>
Sub-races are still absolutely something the team is always thinking about doing. <br>
<br>
<br>

Xavius Dropping Shoulders<br>
Users on Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/5bymxk/just_got_a_drop_that_isnt_on_xavius_loot_table/) noted that Xavius finally started dropping his shoulders (http://www.wowdb.com/items/141006-the-first-satyrs-spaulders) today! <br>

<br>
Increased Mythic Keystone Rewards<br>
With the release of the Trial of Valor raid instance, we&#x2019;re increasing the rewards from Mythic Keystone dungeons, to keep them in line with the increased difficulty (and rewards) from the new raid. We&#x2019;d like to take a moment to clarify what those changes are and when they&#x2019;ll be applied.<br>
<br>
Beginning this week, with the opening of Trial of Valor, the end-of-run chests for completing a Keystone dungeon at level 11 or higher will now give loot with a base item level of 870, up from the previous base of 865 for completing a level 10.<br>
<br>
Additionally, if you are able to clear a Keystone dungeon at difficulty 12 or higher, your Order Hall cache for next week will contain loot with a base item level of 885. Note that this change does not apply to the cache you can open this week, which still has its base item level capped at 880 if you were able to complete a level 10 Keystone dungeon last week.<br>
<br>
Of course, keep in mind that these rewards still have a chance to roll Warforged or Titanforged; the item levels listed above are merely the guaranteed minimum you will receive.<br>
