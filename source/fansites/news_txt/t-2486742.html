Gnome and Tauren Mount Size Update<br>
With today&#x2019;s PTR update, you might notice mount size changes for gnome and tauren player characters. For a very long time, we&#x2019;ve had issues that stem from gnomes and tauren riding on mounts that appear larger than intended. We&#x2019;re adjusting their sizing down on normal* mounts.<br>
This allows us to correct many art and animation bugs with these specific races when mounted, and they look better. Gnomes and tauren now look more like they should, gnomes can actually reach their reins, and tauren can fit through more doorways when mounted.<br>
<br>
Here&#x2019;s an example of how a gnome character looks when mounted-<br>

<br>
This new tech also means that it&#x2019;s now possible for us to address issues where some mounts are too small on some races. We&#x2019;re looking to find examples along those lines, so please keep your feedback coming.<br>
Thank you!<br>
*There are a few mounts that are not considered &quot;normal&quot;-sized to begin with. For example, Hyena mounts are considered &quot;small&quot;, and we&#x2019;re not sizing tauren differently on small mounts at this time.</div></div>
