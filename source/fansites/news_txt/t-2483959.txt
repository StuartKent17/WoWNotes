Sinister Gladiator's Maledict  now immediately displays a new additional debuff on players targeted by the trinket's spell indicating when they will be struck by its damage and healing absorb effects.



Patch 8.2 PTR - Nazjatar Budding Deepcoral Item
Recently, the Budding Deepcoral  was added to the PTR, allowing you to ride your underwater mounts like normal mounts in Nazjatar. This item costs 5 Prismatic Manapearl  and can be purchased from the same vendors that sell the Benthic Gear  in Nazjatar. The item is consumed on use and doesn't provide any indication that the item is active. It persists through log outs, but is removed the moment you leave Nazjatar and must be repurchased to use again.
