Mage<br>
<br>
Talents<br>
<br>
Fixed an issue where certain situations could cause Mages to not receive the Invoker&apos;s Energy buff after successfully completing an Evocation (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/12051).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Quests<br>
<br>
Battle for Razor Hill: Fixed an issue where players were becoming stuck because the Zulu Rock buff was not being removed when the player dies.<br>
Mogu Incursions: Master Snowdrift should no longer be engaging in combat with Shan&apos;ze Invaders, allowing players to turn-in the quest.<br>
<br>
<br>
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br>
<br>
Throne of Thunder<br>
<br>
Ra-den<br>

<br>
Made additional fixes for an issue where players may be unable summon incantation bosses.<br>
<br>

Character / Items<br>
Any reason the Valor of Ancients buff isn&apos;t cross realm, The rep bonus is but alts would find this a very welcome change.<br>
It&apos;s a difficult technical challenge having to do with e.g. raids unlocking at different times. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/347090428207722497))<br>
<br>
I realize you didnt design the tier 16s, but I was hoping warriors would look like Garrosh not a paladin with horns sewn on.<br>
I used to weigh in more on player feedback of art sets, but it turns out art is just sooo subjective. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350643880993103876))<br>
The best thing I can suggest is maybe just feedback on armor themes you&apos;d like to see (e.g. Your Garrosh example). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350644011012333568))<br>
<br>
In this blog (http://t.co/FXKQ4KrLur), you said legendaries would be more exclusive than in Cata. Why make them more accessible?<br>
With the current legendary quest, everyone can have the expectation of getting them so it&apos;s fine. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350651458850533376))<br>
yet.... they aren&apos;t &quot;legendary&quot; any more. people are expecting too much for nothing.<br>
Another reason why they aren&apos;t weapons. Our grand plan will likely make more sense closer to 5.4 ship. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350653375701983234))<br>
<br>
it disapp. me that now there&apos;s a leg. for everyone and it&apos;s a cloak thats shaped like a towel and clips models. Why no weapon?<br>
We feel like we&apos;ve done that a lot before. We want to keep things fresh. When rewards are too predictable they get boring. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350652781041946624))<br>
These are a pretty different design than Fangs / Wrath. The problem with those was the expectation / entitlement. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350651006666805248))<br>
When there is too much expectation, the item goes from feeling like a bonus to a penalty. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350651279208480770))<br>
<br>
I am thoroughly disappointed with the legendary being a cloak. All of this work throughout the xpac and we don&apos;t use it again.<br>
What do you mean by &quot;don&apos;t use it again?&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350646916398325760))<br>
These cloak models are pretty much standard fare, don&apos;t stand out from normal gear. Most people will hide them<br>
The cloaks aren&apos;t intended to compete with glaives though. Wouldn&apos;t glaives be less special if everyone was rocking them? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350656078746353667))<br>
<br>
Please make the questline cloaks non-unique. I&apos;d love one for my offspec, just like I could get offspec gems.<br>
We&apos;re still discussing it, but it&apos;s on the table for sure. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350655512028774400))<br>
<br>
Any chance of with all the changes bring brought in, cross-faction flex raids might be a possibility? Or dungeons.. anything?<br>
We feel like cross-faction goes against the spirit of World of Warcraft. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350643398165794816))<br>
<br>
PLZ let us do flex w/ &lt;10. Scaling floor can still be 10. Current challenge for our small guild is just getting 10 online.<br>
Understood, but we have to draw the line somewhere. If we say 8 then the guilds with 4 will feel excluded, yanno? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/344256954279006209))<br>
<br>
Trying to understand self-loot in Flex. If they&apos;re our FRIENDS, why would we be so distrustful? Prefer normal loot rules.<br>
It is mostly because we don&apos;t have a system yet to scale number of drops with number of players. Maybe in the future. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/348469844682866689))<br>
<br>
is there any chance to avoid drops at 10man that doesnt fit to anybody in raid? Like: &quot;no rogues&quot; then &quot;no dagger(agi)&quot;<br>
What if you then stacked 8 rogues to make sure your real rogue had a good chance at a dagger? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339062701076656128))<br>
Thats not what he is saying at all what he is saying it eliminated the chance at something if there is none not visa versa.<br>
They are the same. If I can force loot not to drop then I can force it to drop. At the end of the day it comes down to loot speed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/349298464594731008))<br>
We have a target for how long it takes to earn loot. If we speed it up in some ways, we&apos;d just have to slow it down in others. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/349298656639328256))<br>
<br>
Is the game balanced around raid loot priority Tank &gt; Healer &gt; DPS? Discussing loot system in my guild ATM.<br>
No. We have found that guilds use wildly different methods for determining loot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/349189816467984385))<br>
You can also make the argument that gearing DPS before healers improves success. Shrug. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/349189975541161984))<br>
<br>
Any idea how you will deal with Rune of Reorigination and UVLS? Seem irreplaceable for some, even w/o seeing new trinkets yet.<br>
Would that be the end of the world? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/347935693156265984))<br>
<br>
Professions<br>
Just need to work on ligistics, archaelogy failed horribly in moving from one dig to another. They don`t put you in the world<br>
Archaeology had too much travel time at launch. I think it feels better in MoP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/347393406152097793))<br>
<br>
Reputation / Questing<br>
Any chance we will see a return to the daily style of 5.1? That was by far your best imo. Scenarios, story, felt progressive.<br>
We were getting a lot of negative feedback about daily quests at the time so we wanted to try something else for 5.3 and 5.4. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/347387228659539968))<br>

There were a round of interviews (http://www.guildwars2guru.com/news/1186-mike-zadorojny-interview-round-up/) with some of the ArenaNet developers recently, and it appears that it isn&apos;t only WoW players that want content faster. Currently GW2 gets some sort of an update every 3 weeks or so, with the Bazaar of the Four Winds (http://www.guildwars2guru.com/news/1183-bazaar-of-the-four-winds/) update coming next. <br>
<br>
ArenaNet is now aiming for content updates every two weeks going forward.The developers that work on these updates are split into four teams that are each working on their own update, allowing for enough time to properly test and catch many of the issues that arise from rapid development and frequent patches.<br>
<br>
Another interesting point that came up in the interviews is the lack of planned expansions. Rather than adding expansions to the game, the current plan is to continue with the Living World concept and just keep adding new content every few weeks. This content development is funded by purchases in the in game Gem Store, which amounts to enough to keep the team of over 300 developers going strong. The game has sold 3 million copies as of January this year though, so ongoing sales likely play a role in this funding as well.<br>
