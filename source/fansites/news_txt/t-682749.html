Core Hound Pup<br>
Nethaera revealed something very interesting about the Core Hound Pup (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69452/core-hound-pup/) ... You can get it just by getting an Authenticator! It will work with the physical authenticator from the Blizzard Store (http://us.blizzard.com/store/) and the mobile version (http://mobile.blizzard.com/) as well. <br>
The Core Hound Pup is a gift for anyone using an authenticator (attached to an account) whether it&apos;s the physical authenticator or the mobile authenticator. Anyone who attaches an authenticator will also receive this lovable new pet. Think of it as your own personal guard dog. <br>

Second wing of Icecrown Citadel will open in 28 Days<br>
Icecrown Citadel opened with 4 bosses available: Lord Marrowgar (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=897), Lady Deathwhisper (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=894), Gunship Battle (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=893), Deathbringer Saurfang (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=900).<br>
<br>
It will take a few weeks before players can reach the next 3 bosses: Rotface (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=899), Festergut (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=892), Professor Putricide (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=898). You can check how many days are left before the next unlock by talking to your faction NPC (Saurfang/Muradin) after defeating Deathbringer Saurfang. Thanks to Eisley from Eclipsed (US-Destromath) for the screenshot.<br>
<br>
The next unlock will happen on January 5th, if each wing is unlocked after a month it means that we won&apos;t see Arthas before April but if I had to give my opinion I would say that it will probably be faster than that. The 4 weeks are probably here to let people test the rest of the content without focusing too much on raid instances. <br>

Blue posts<br>
Buff Box<br>
I will take this moment to plug again one of my favorite new interface features, the buff box. It puts long-term and very short-term, spammy buffs into a stack of icons so that you can notice more important ones when they pop up.<br>
<br>
There is a similar new option for restricting only your debuffs on the target (in case you don&apos;t care about what the Shadow Priests are doing, but you really want to notice Sunder Armor, Thunderclap and Demo Shout.)<br>
<br>
It&apos;s not for everyone, but it might be useful to some of you.<br>

<br>
Dungeon System Restrictions<br>
There are only two things that will prevent you from using Dungeon Finder to enter a dungeon: 1) You aren&apos;t attuned yet. The new Icecrown dungeons for example require you to do the first wing first. 2) Your gear is too low. To be clear, we are very lenient on this last point. It&apos;s basically there to keep new players in quest greens from stumbling into heroics where they&apos;ll probably struggle. (If you really want to take an undergeared player like this, you can still zone in the old-fashioned way). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21730603153-serious-dps-problem-with-lfg-system.html))<br>
<br>
Cross-Realms Dungeon crashes<br>
The issue here is a result of the stress the instance servers are under. Resolving this remains a top priority for us. If you are unable to properly zone into a dungeon, you can try clicking on the Dungeon Finder icon and selecting &quot;Teleport to Instance.&quot; This should temporarily prevent you from receiving the Dungeon Deserter debuff, or enacting the Dungeon Finder cooldown.<br>
<br>
That said, we will look into ways of improving the way dungeon cooldowns are applied in the event players are unable to properly zone into an instance. In the mean time I do apologize for what happened to you. Many players are currently experiencing similar issues zoning into instances tonight and we&apos;re confident we&apos;ll have a fix for that soon.

ilvl 251 T10 Tanking Chest<br>
There is a bug with the stats on the 10-player version of the tier 10 tanking DK breastplate.<br>
<br>
If you manage to acquire this item, we will get the stats straightened out. However I can&apos;t give you a timeline on when that will be. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/21730673021-no-first-tier-t10-dk-tank-chest.html))</div></div>
