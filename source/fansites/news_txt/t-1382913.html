Blue Posts<br>
Amount of Feedback<br>
However the question is, are we as a community getting enough feedback, back from Blizzard. <br>
What is it that you would like to hear more from us about? We regularly communicate on the hot topics that we see on the forums, however we want to ensure that we don&apos;t detract from the feedback that is being given in a particular thread. We especially don&apos;t want to end up derailing a good discussion simply by being present, or by what we bring to the discussion. Sometimes it&apos;s better for us to let a topic run its course as this is at heart a community forum for you guys to discuss the game.<br>
<br>
Once in a very long while there comes a blue, sits down and chats with the community for a while about a certain topic in a thread. And that&apos;s great. But how often does that happen? <br>
I personally try to jump in here to chat with you all on a regular basis, just as the other Community team members do. Remember that the work that the community team does isn&apos;t solely about posting on the forums, in fact posting here on the forums and on social media is just one small part of the job that we do. <br>
<br>
But when you make it seem like your feedback doesn&apos;t matter or isn&apos;t heard, then people kind of lose motivation to continue their feedback. <br>
A blue post in a thread is not intended as a way for us to show that a thread has been read, our posts are simply that, posts. We read every thread possible and we relay the feedback that you give back to the developers, they even read the forums and your feedback themselves. Understand that your feedback does matter to us, in fact every voice matters to us, it&apos;s one of our core values. Don&apos;t lose that motivation to provide quality feedback as it does help to make World of Warcraft a better game for everyone.<br>
<br>
More blue posts would be lovely, but what I&apos;d really like to see is more time and dedication from Blizzard. Even something as simple as &quot;We agree that warriors are a little over the top at the moment but want to wait and see how they play out when players are fully geared.&quot; or something like that you know? Just like you tell us, &quot;all of your feedback matters, keep it coming!&quot;, we are saying this right back at you! <br>
I actually made a similar post about Blood Death Knights recently saying that we&apos;re aware of the difficulties players are facing against them. On the topic of Warriors, we&apos;re aware that Warrior participation numbers have increased, but this is mainly due to the changes in 5.4. Warriors also scale incredibly well with weapons, which many players have recently gotten and all of this means a lot of players are trying the class out, or have gone back to a Warrior that they&apos;d stopped playing previously, and so on. <br>
<br>
We are keeping an eye on Warrior performance, but don&apos;t want to nerf them if it turns out to be unnecessary.<br>
<br>
Sit down and chat with us about all the different issues that are going on. Keep us up to date about what the developers are up to. It makes us feel like we and our voices matter <br>
Your voices do matter greatly to us, and we try to sit down and chat with you all whenever we can. Be sure to remember that the feedback you provide is of great importance to us and if you wish to even provide any about the Community team and its members performance or interactions, including mine, then please do so by sending an email to CMFeedback-EN@Blizzard.com<br>
<br>
To quell the comments about Warriors in this thread before they get out of hand; I in no way said that Warriors as a class are fine or perfectly balanced. I also didn&apos;t say that we wouldn&apos;t be making changes to them due to their current state.<br>
<br>
My post simply stated some of the reasons for the increased participation numbers that we&apos;ve been seeing from Warriors as a class in Arena. I also said that we&apos;re watching the performance of the Warrior class closely and we&apos;ll make changes if required. We will make a change for Warriors, but that&apos;s more in the spirit of making Arena more enjoyable, rather than as a direct nerf to the class. The main thing that we don&apos;t want to do is nerf the class unnecessarily or too much to avoid another issue. <br>
<br>
I don&apos;t care how popular they are, there is no reason why Warrior representation should be higher than that of all other melee specs combined.<br>
Representation is not an indicator for class strength, but more for the classes popularity. Class strength is of course a factor in its popularity, but it isn&apos;t the be all and end all.

Hunter Pet Bug<br>
Thanks for letting us know about this particular issue. This is an issue where hunters are able to increase the power of their pets and deal rather large amounts of damage in a short period. I&apos;m happy to let you all know that we are aware of this and have managed to create a hotfix that should solve the problem. We very recently applied this fix to the game and it should take effect once your realm is restarted, so you shouldn&apos;t be encountering Hunter pets with extremely powerful attacks for long.
