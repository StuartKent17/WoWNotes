New profession : Inscription. (allows the player to permanently enhance their spells and abilities and to create mysterious items of power to use, trade, and sell.)<br>
More hero classes will be added in the future<br>
Leveling from 70 to 80 should took nearly the same time as 60 to 70 (probably a bit more)<br>

Informations from other source :<br>
The level cap at Blizzcon will be set to 72 (It will be 80 at the release, of course)<br>
Utgarde Keep should be one of the first dungeon you can access, and the first wing will be playable at Blizzcon.<br>
Horde players will be able to access Northrend by taking a Zeppelin in Tirisfal Glades, they will arrive at Vengeance Landing in Howling Fjord. (This wasn&apos;t mentionned, but we can assume that Alliance players will arrive at Valgarde)<br>

2.2 PTR Patch<br>
Remember ? There is a PTR Patch going. It seems that I missed a few monsters in it, but Endarion was here to save the day. Thanks to him for the nice screenshots ^^<br>
I don&apos;t know where the Headless Horseman will be used, but the Brewfest Ram will probably be used to race. (See the news about the Brewfest)<br>
