Blue posts
We've got a bunch of important blue posts here, changes to Howling Blast for Death Knights and Vengeance for paladins, Q&A for Paladins and Druids ... Some of these posts also mention changes from the latest notes update.
Pure DPS Classes and raid content difficulty
From our POV, hunters, mages, warlocks and rogues are pure classes. All other classes are hybrids. Priests are hybrids because they have a viable dps spec.

The problem for dps essentially comes down to the fact that there are many more dps trees than raid slots available. Healers by contrast are needed in greater proportion as you go from 5-player to 25-player content. If the average 25-player raid has 6-8 healers, then all 5 healing specs have room, and we try to make sure a raid that brings them all feels rewarded for it. We also try to make sure that a raid that has only say Holy paladins does not wipe repeatedly on every encounter.

Now, one thing you need to remember is that the current raid content is undertuned on purpose. It's easy. We wanted a lot of players to see Naxxramas and not to hit a brick wall when they tried to graduate from heroics to raiding. But you need fewer healers for easier content and swapping in more dps can just speed up the whole run. Naxx can be done pretty quickly, but it's not Karazhan.

Ulduar will be more difficult and bringing more healers will be the norm. The only downside is it will shine a harsher on light on any class imbalance and players will become more concerned about not getting a spot.

We think the new system is a big improvement, especially compared to the way groups had to stack for Sunwell. Let me be clear though: it's not perfect and we're going to have to continue to improve situations where a dps or healing spec just doesn't bring enough to the table. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14318867545-whats-good-for-the-goose-is-for-the-gander.html

RNG Stuns
We have been waging a long war against random proc stuns. We managed to clean up several of them when we changed mace spec, but like vermin, they sometimes crop up again.

The Death and Decay glyph and Starfall with Celestial Focus were the two greatest offenders because they affect multiple targets. We will almost certainly be phasing out the single target random stuns such as the Starfire stun of Celestial Focus and Blackout as well. We didn't do that yet because it involves changing several talents and in some cases we will need to provide compensation.

Howling Blast cooldown changed to 5 seconds
I believe the cooldown is 5 seconds now, so at least it should mesh a little better with 10 second rune cooldown.

We knew there was a risk in taking the Howling Blast cooldown off. Unfortunately, we saw dual-wield DK numbers as high as ever even with the Killing Machine and Gargoyle nerfs. It typically only happened when the DK was fighting multiple targets, which suggests Howling Blast is the right thing to change.

We still agree that a cooldown makes rotations more awkward, and we will continue to look for an implementation that lets Howling Blast be off a cooldown without all death knights feel like they need to DW Frost or go home.

And no, we can't buff other DK specs and other classes to 7000 dps or whatever to compensate. Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318937445-gc-howling-blast-cooldown-not-needed.html

Starfall
If you are a druid who doesn't like Starfall, we have noted your feedback. Starfall is area effect damage that you don't have to channel. That is it's purpose. If it isn't doing that job, we can buff it. But introducting an overpowered and frustrating PvP mechanic is not a good way to fix the spell. We removed the de-stealth for the same reason.

Developer Q&A Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14318876511-jump-wave-gc--druids-have-questions-too.html
1. Is any attention being given to how bad many Druids perceived Replenish? Maybe uping the returns of mana at the very least? 
Yes, it is dreadful. Totally agree. 

2. Is any attention being given to how bad many Druids perceive Living Seed? Living Seed is very low on overall healing for 3 talent points mostly because it is based off crits, which outside Regrowth aren't a Druid's strong stat, it is over-heal the majority of the time.
I don't think Seed is nearly as bad as Replenishment. We get caught in this cycle sometimes where a class says "I don't want X stat" so we give them a talent that uses it and then the response is "now you are making me want a stat I don't want." That's overly pithy to describe the situation, but it does come up a lot. 

3. Is any attention being give to how bad our PvP survivability is? We can't stay in Tree if a warlock is around. We can't CC if we are in Tree. If we aren't in Tree we lose our armor and melee tear through us faster than if we are in it. Lifeblooms that cost about 1500 mana to stack to 3 are being wisped away by DKs without so much as a thought or bloom. The regen in what PvP gear is accessible to losing teams is terrible. The numbers show Resto Druids are the worst Healers in arena atm. Yes even worse than priests. 
PvP survivability is not something we want to address on a class by class basis at this point. A lot of players feel they are dying too quickly. Going through all the talent trees to offer survivability doesn't get at the root of this concern. As an aside, non-tanks often skip survivability talents anyway unless they are borderline OP in PvP. We are trying to bundle more of them with offensive effects.

4. Haste and Crit on our gear is pretty useless to us after a certain point. Once we reach the Haste softcap for raids, which is pretty low, we don't need that anymore. Crit is also pretty situational as it will only really affect Nourish and we don't get enough Crit on our gear for it to be a substantional boost to the spell. Perhaps Haste affecting Hot Ticks. Perhaps Crit affecting Hots - yeah i am dreaming on that one, but can u tell us why not?
Honestly, there is a technical limitation that prevents hots and dots from being able to crit. We are removing that limitation though, so who knows. Haste and armor pen are things we put on lower level gear to make it lower level gear. Higher level gear will be more suitablly optimized. 

5. Poor Idol choices. Currently there is 1 for lifebloom and 1 for rejuv. Any hopes of getting more for other spells or perhaps less specific idols? 
We will try and add more. Typically these need to go on vendors though not always since they are so spec specific and therefore prone to causing frustration when they drop. 

6. Why can't we cast thorns in Tree Form? 
We want druids to be shapeshifters so we constantly struggle with how much to allow them to do without shifting. Feral and Balance have a lot of the same questions. 

7. Why can't Trees cast Barkskin while silenced. Trees do have bark afterall. 
If you have bark, then why do you need more? Seriously, this is something we are considering. 

8. Having more than 1 Tree in a Raid usually only happens if there is a lack of other healers. Any input on what can be done about Trees stacking better with eachother? Like a boost to Hots if another tree has one up on a target?
I am not finding this is a general rule one tree per raid except for groups that just tended to keep the same players they had in BC. Except for paladins with their weird buff stacking mechanics something we are looking at I do see plenty of concerns from all classes that there isn't enough reason to bring more than one of them. Yet, that was kind of the point. All things being equal, we would prefer you to bring a diverse group to avoid raid stacking and get everyone into the raids but we don't want to overly penalize you if you cannot for whatever reason. 

[...]
I did not say your hots will just start critting in the next patch. I said we had the technology to do that if we think it is necessary. We would certainly have to nerf Resto in other ways to compensate for those higher healing numbers. Source http://

High damage against undead in raids

Paladins being better against undead and demons than other types of creatures is a problem, especially when the current content has a lot of undead and the next tier will most likely have far less. 

Assume for the sake of argument that the damage you do in Naxx at 3 Vengeance stacks is the damage we want you to do all the time. You don't need to invoke "but if we are good in Naxx we will be just okay in Ulduar." That is a design problem you don't need to worry about.

Developers Q&A Source http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14318637025-gc-direct-priest-questions-only.html
1 Power Word: Shield and Divine Aegis current do not work properly on Feral Druid, Shadow Priest and Shaman targets under certain conditions. This is a major bug that undermines the ability of a Discipline priest to heal these classes. Is there are fix in the works? Timeline?
This bug is fixed in 3.0.8 to the best of our knowledge.

2 There is a similar problem with Guardian Spirit not triggering for Feral Druids. Is this related?
Same.

3 Both Hymn spells are woefully inadequate and underpowered. Are there plans to look at these spells? Timeline? 
Yes, I have said before Hymns are near the top of our list of priest issues. 

4 The Shadowfiend has significant usability issues both in PVE and PVP. It has very low health and dies quickly, often does not attack the intended target, and is just an overall clunky and difficult to use mechanic for mana regen. Are there plans to replace/alter this ability? Timeline? 
We are not going to replace the ability, but we do want it to do what it was designed to do, which is restore your mana. 

5 It has been stated that the party only mechanics of spells are not what Blizzard wants or intends to carry forward. Are there plans to alter the party only nature of PoH and Holy Nova? Timeline? 
That is our eventual goal. You can't just take a party spell and shift it up to raid level without making other changes. It would be too overpowered at its current numbers, and if we deflate the numbers, it wouldn't do it's job, particularly in 5-player groups. Therefore both will require tinkering to change them. We don't view these as critical issues so they are low on the list. Holy Nova is slightly higher. 

6 Power Word: Shield and Divine Aegis are staples in the toolbag for a Disc priest. Both of these have issues when there is more than one priest on a target. Shields and Aegis overwite eachother and reduce the procs on them to the priests mana regen. Is there a plan to look at stacking these? Timeline? 
I posted about this recently. It's probably easier if you find the quote than have me dig back through the data or I won't have time to get to all these other questions. 

7 Renew and PoH and Holy Nova seem to have too high a mana cost for their effect. Are you planning on looking at the HPM values of spells post-CoH nerf as these will be used far more often now? 
I don't think PoH is a bad spell, though it is interesting that priests tend to either use it often or never. Holy Nova and Renew likely could use some higher numbers. Renew is still a decent spell though. I don't think it is "take off your bar" level. The coefficient may be too low or perhaps not enough talents affect it.

8  Lightwell, for all of it's paper effectiveness, is just not getting used. Can it be looked at? Change the mechanic? Remove it completely and replace it? 
It's tough because it provides an amazing amount of healing but the damage-dealers are often too stubborn to use it. We're not sure if that means the spell needs to change, because it could easily be the kind of things that players figure out, particularly once the PvE content is more challenging than it is now. Changing your target is annoying and something we'd like to fix. 

9 With the change or lack of fix to Reflective Shield, it is now a PVP only ability. Was this the intent or are we still looking at a potential change in the future? 
It is not the intent, but it's a technical limitation. As you suggest, the spell has not worked for some time on other players. We just changed the tooltip to reflect that. We do eventually want to change it to affect other players once we get new tech from the programmers.

10 Maintaining Inner Fire due to charges is not fun. Are there plans to remove the charges or change the upkeep mechanics? 
We totally understand the ongoing concerns about the spell. Players never want short-term buffs. Left up to them all buffs would go to a 30-minute duration or even just a passive benefit up all the time. We don't think buffs that require so little maintenance are really buffs at all though -- they just become passive bonuses. So when we talk about this spell, we quickly get into this issue. Very short term buffs like Battle Shout suffer the same problem -- players would make them long or passive in a heartbeat. But aren't we really just removing spells from the game when we do that? 

11 Improved Divine Spirit seems lackluster compared to Flametongue totem. Can we look at this and balance it? 
I would be surprised if this portion of the Discipline tree looked the same in 3.1. I'll leave it at that. 

12 The utility of healing priests in raids is limited. Fort and SP can all be buffed by a shadow priest, Mass Dispel and Shackle has use only in specific situations and Spirit requires only a single Disc Priest. From my perspective, adding a stackable raid utility to the healing priest would go a long way to ensuring their inclusion in raids. Can you give us your thoughts on this?
We don't want any spec to feel so mandatory that they always earn a raid spot. That goes counter to our design. It is impossible to design a system where all 30 specs bring unique buffs such that you bring one of each to a 10 or 25-player raid. Therefore we went in the opposite direction where you can get the buffs you need without bringing specific specs. There are a few exceptions, but those are also things we are likely to iron out. 

13 Discipline does not have the same bonus healing talents that the holy tree has and therefore presents an issue with scaling. As gear increases, the effectiveness of Disc compared to Holy decreases. Is this the intent? Maybe move some of the holy bonuses lower on the holy tree so Disc can get them? Your thoughts? 
I don't think Disc can fill it's role with shields alone. They are cool, but the spec also needs to be able to throw down some single-target healing that is close to paladin level. There are a few different ways we can accomplish this. Overall we are thrilled to see Disc getting so much attention in PvE it has been good in PvP for a few seasons, but it's not quite there yet. 

Note: A timeline would be really useful, even if it's a guesstimate. I want to know whether I should keep going on my priest, or leave her on a shelf and play an alt. I realize alot of these issues aren't "class breaking" but when it comes down to it, if I am going to be of more use to my guild by playing a different class, I would rather just level an alt, rather than waste time playing my priest. 
We are always very reluctant to provide timelines. No matter how often you add "if all goes according to plan," "at this time," or "assuming nothing changes," it has been Blizzard's experience that players only focus on the date and then feel disappointed, frustrated or even lied to if we miss that date for any of a number of reasons. Many of the things I mentioned are things we are looking at for 3.1. I can't tell you when we think 3.1 will ship and there is certainly a possibility that some of these changes might not make it for any of a number of reasons including triage of more pressing matters, missing tech or bugs that are difficult to fix, making a bad situation worse and so on. All of this leads to the inevitable Soontm.

Totems, totems, totems?
In this thread, we are looking for feedback on totems as a mechanic. This question is more open-ended and higher-level than some of the topics we bring up for discussion. You can explain what you don't like about totems, or how they would work if it was up to you.

There are only a couple of ground rules:

For purposes of this thread, please confine the discussion to totems and don't list everything you would like changed about the shaman class. Don't review talents or other spells. Just talk about totems.

Totems are a class-defining feature for the shaman. We are not going to remove totems and we do not wish to marginalize them. We are totally open to ideas that make them cooler, however. 

To clarify, I meant margnizalization in terms of the feature. I have seen proposals before that were basically to pull every spell off of totems and just let shamans ignore them. We don't want totems to be a secondary class feature like pickpocketing or lockpicking. They need to be front and center, more like to use the rogue example again posions, combo points and stealth.
