Last week I only &quot;found&quot; two of them but I got lucky yesterday and found another two. (They&apos;re the two &quot;unstable&quot; on the left)<br>

If you don&apos;t know what to do tonight, you should also check Unlimited Escapism vol. 2 (http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=39221). It was released yesterday and it&apos;s got very nice scenes, you can also check the vol. 1 here (http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=37245) if you missed it.<br>
