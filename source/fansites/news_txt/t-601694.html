<br>
So what I want to do in Northrend is to take Naxxramas in all of its glory, scale it down to the 25 man raid size, and then take the difficulty and retune it&#x2014;obviously we&#x2019;d tune for level 80, it would no longer be tuned for level 60, since that would be a little silly and it wouldn&#x2019;t be a lot of fun for people at that point&#x2014;but I want to put rewards in there that are very exciting to level 80 players, but make it the entry-level raid, very accessible, tune the encounters so that there&#x2019;s something for everybody to do, and let the majority get a chance to see that content that they hadn&#x2019;t seen before.<br>
