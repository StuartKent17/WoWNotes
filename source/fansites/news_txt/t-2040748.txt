Legion - Ratstallion Mount
With Legion approaching, we are going back and updating a few older previews. If you want to test out this mount, you can use the Ratstallion Harness  from the Crate of Ratstallion Harnesses  sold by Raethan  for 950 x Sightless Eye  Sadly this will only let you ride him around in the Underbelly.

If you want the real deal , you will want to complete Underbelly Tycoon  for Ratstallion

In lieu of disabling Action Cam, can yall add a setting option with a "experimental" disclaimer? Its a huge feature to lose...
Yep, that's a great idea, and pretty much what we're planning. Not possible without a real patch though. WatcherDev
