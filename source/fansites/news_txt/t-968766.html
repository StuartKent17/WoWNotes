<br>
Worgen Racial Mounts Clarification<br>
The intention with the new mounts was just to honor player concerns about achievements and even up the mount totals between the alliance and the horde. It&#x2019;s something people had been requesting since the release of Cataclysm, so we&#x2019;re evening up the numbers by giving the Alliance some additional mounts to add to their totals.<br>
<br>
The Worgen racial mount is Running Wild. These are just some extra horses, for your horse needs. Perhaps the blog should have been titled &apos;New Gilnean Faction Mount&apos;? Or maybe just &apos;Wyld Stallyns&apos;? We may actually edit the blog to clarify why these mounts were added. To be clear, it&#x2019;s not because we think worgen look their awesomest riding horses.<br>
<br>
The intention wasn&apos;t really to hype this up, so much as to simply inform and reduce confusion. Our thought was, rather than let these be introduced without any context via data-mining, that it seemed like a better idea to introduce them ourselves with a bit of context.<br>
<br>
[...] There was some miscommunication regarding the initial reason why these mounts were added. After talking with the devs again these mounts are actually being added because they already happened to be available and we thought it&#x2019;d be nice to make them able to be purchased and ridden. Which is unfortunately quite a bit different than how we understood and framed the blog.<br>
<br>
Their existence also allows us to give players that faction change to Worgen something in exchange for their old racial mount. Right now if you faction change to Worgen you lose your previous home-faction mounts, and so we&#x2019;re also trying to correct that with this change. <br>

Patch 4.3 Preview - Worgen Racial Mounts<br>
We&apos;re not going to make it very far without transportation, are we? If we just hightail it out of here, the forsaken will catch up to us in no time at all.<br>
<br>
Rounding up some horses from the stable grounds southeast of here would normally be a breeze, but there&apos;s one snag. That last quake must&apos;ve spooked Koroth, the ettin, down from the mountains. If we don&apos;t get our horses soon, I fear that he will.<br>
<br>
In patch 4.3, we&#x2019;ll be introducing worgen racial mounts to the stables of Azeroth. These sleek horses have been constant companions for the denizens of Gilneas since time immemorial, and your worgen characters will now be able to claim their ancestral mounts.<br>
