Earlier this year, Carbine announced (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4922-Patch-6-2-Corrupted-Dreadwing-Frostwolf-Helm-Blue-Tweets-Wildstar-Free-to-Play#wsf2p) that Wildstar was moving to a free to play model. That day is finally here! You can find out more (http://www.wildstar-online.com/en/news/2015-05-28-wildstar-is-going-free-to-play-heres-all-you-need-to-know/) about the Free to Play transition or grab the new smaller client (https://twitter.com/derek_delakron/status/648279638377009152) and some addons (http://www.curse.com/ws-addons/wildstar). The Wildstar subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/3mqxv4/meta_check_here_first_before_posting_f2p_launch/) also has some helpful links.<br>

The first Guild Wars 2 expansion is only a few weeks away and ArenaNet recently published the launch trailer. Don&apos;t forget that they also made the base game free to play with some restrictions (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5118-Timewarped-Badge-Rewards-September-2-Hotfixes-Tweets-GW2-Base-Game-Free-to-Play#gw2f2p) recently as well. Guild week (https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/welcome-to-guild-week/) starts on Tuesday, with information on the new guild features coming in Heart of Thorns.<br>

Blue Tweets<br>
If you&apos;re in Ashran, we think it&apos;s okay to bring 4 friends along with you. But bringing 39 creates an unfair environment. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/646509965465616384))<br>
Certainly happy that new communities have sprung up and new friendships have been formed. But not at the expense of fairplay. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/646510398091362304))<br>
Unfortunately, a few people have circumvented those restrictions and we&apos;ve had to create additional measures. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/646510211453194240))<br>
I am not sure I understand. So working together as a team is frowned upon in an MMO?<br>
Seems like you&apos;re twisting my words. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/646511254761160704))<br>
<br>
Why no just remove the (Ashran) debuff from the game? take less code hrs, Please?<br>
We think it&apos;s important that all players that enter Ashran have an equal opportunity to compete. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/646509604638035968))<br>
idk if you&apos;ve been to ashran but they all seem extremely one sided, mostly in favor of alliance<br>
I receive an equal number of &quot;Horde always wins&quot; and &quot;Alliance always wins&quot; complaints. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/646511506725535744))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
which is sad. Player insight into the the why&apos;s of development is great, makes the decisions feel less arbitrary<br>
Exactly. So maybe let&apos;s give up on the whole petition to get someone fired strategy. (Autocorrect said &quot;furred&quot; lol.) (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/646129772163043328))<br>
<br>
If you aren&#x2019;t controversial, either you&#x2019;re a puppet or you do nothing important.<br>
That may be the case, but some companies view social media as a distraction, so being controversial is a net loss. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/646163229723353088))<br>
