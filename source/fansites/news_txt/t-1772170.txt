Darkmoon Faire Races
The Darkmoon Faire is back again, bringing us yet another race, in addition to the other Patch 6.1 changes  The Wanderluster is the new mount this time around, with an additional achievement: Darkmoon Like the Wind 

The first race uses the smaller course, allowing you to earn Wanderluster: Gold  and the Attraction Sign  

The second race uses the big course, allowing you to earn Big Wanderluster: Gold  and the Darkmoon Gazer  The Gazer is not a toy, so it will take up an additional inventory slot. 

The Wanderluster mount jumps to hazards  rather than gates, allowing you to jump to the wires and be immune for 4 seconds. It has the old ability that allows you to pull powerups to you. It also has a new ability  that gives you a shield that protects you from the mini-zeppelins. If they hit you while the shield is up, you get a speed boost, starting at 100 and stacking up to 150.

The trick this month is to use the shield or other speed boosts at the start of the course to get a faster start. This can be accomplished by starting a race, getting your speed boost, running back, abandoning the quest, and starting again.

Pets and Pet Battles
I'm still waiting to breed my battle pets. It would give the feature so much more to enjoy.
When you start to flesh out the concept, it gets weird. Terrible Turnip/Alliance Balloon fanfic weird. Muffinus 

Misc
Working on a decades-spanning project, I feel that this is applicable. Thoughts?  Muffinus 
Maybe do the spectacle creep in steps, like the vid, from 5 person to whole galaxy, WOAH there, couldn't they maybe save a town?
Design Challenge: what's happening to that town? If it's on fire, -5 points Simpsons, er, WoD did it. Muffinus 
WoD was hurt by this,and again in general I think yall try too hard
I'm gonna spurt off a new thread with more talking space, what would you like to see less of/more of? Open discussion. Muffinus 

is, we survived being put on fire and our minds flayed and armor broken but our characters head could be crushed under a kodo
.Describe a time in the game in which you died, and it felt ok, meaningful or justified or cool, etc. Muffinus 


Computers - Setup of the Month
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!

This month
The current SSD prices  are trending slightly downward again over the past few months, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. 

New GPUs from AMD may be coming in the second half of this year, but no official announcements have been made. 

Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14  

Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 4790K and should spend that money elsewhere.

Make sure to keep your AMD  and Nvidia  drivers up to date.

Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum  for any extra questions!
