Curse  guild from Vek'nilash is currently having some fun in Hyjal Summit on the PTR, and they're of course dropping new loots. A GM is helping them but no bosses got death touched, they just fought them without the trash "waves" before the bosses. 
At the time of this news, they're still in Hyjal and we should have new loots to post very soon.

Loots summary
Azgalor : [Shady Dealer's Pantaloons], [Gloves of the Forgotten Vanquisher], [Gloves of the Forgotten Conqueror]
Kaz'rogal : , [Kaz'rogal's Hardened Heart]
