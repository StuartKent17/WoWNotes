New Real ID Party Feature Now Available for Testing<br>
You heard it here first, the news is now official! the Real ID Party Feature is now available for testing!<br>
When delving into the depths of Azeroth&apos;s darkest dungeons, it always helps to have some friends at your side... now you&apos;re able to issue a call to arms no matter what realm they play on. We&apos;re pleased to announce the new Real ID Party feature is now available for testing! This new feature will allow World of Warcraft players to invite their real-life Real ID friends of the same faction to a party regardless of the realm they play on, and then queue up for a 5-player regular or Heroic dungeon.<br>
<br>
To learn more about Real ID, please visit the Real ID web page (http://us.battle.net/en/realid/) and read the FAQ (http://us.battle.net/en/realid/faq).<br>

Real ID Party Feature &#x2013; Test Phase FAQ<br>
<br>
Q: What is the Real ID Party feature?<br>
A: Players can now invite Real ID friends of the same faction to a 5-player normal or Heroic dungeon group, regardless of what realm their friends are on. This system is designed to make it easier for real-life friends to play together.<br>
<br>
Q: How do I invite Real ID friends to a Real ID party?<br>
A: Inviting a Real ID friend to a Real ID Party is simple. Just open up your Friends list to see which Real ID friends are online. Click on the &#x201C;Plus&#x201D; button to send an invitation to a Real ID friend to join your group. You can continue to add Real ID friends to your party until the group is complete. If you cannot complete the group with Real ID friends, you are free to join the Dungeon Finder to fill in the missing roles. <br>
<br>
Q: Does a player need to have Real ID enabled to accept a Real ID group invite?<br>
A: Yes, a player must have Real ID enabled, and both players must be Real ID friends to accept or initiate Real ID party invitations.<br>
<br>
Q: Can a party leader invite a mix of Real ID friends, character-level friends, guildmates, or random players to the same party?<br>
A: A party leader can invite any combination of Real ID friends from any realm, guildmates from the same realm, or other characters from the same realm to the same party. If the party leader isn&#x2019;t able to fill up the entire party, the Dungeon Finder can fill in the missing roles.<br>
<br>
Q: Can I invite someone who is not a Real ID friend?<br>
A: You can only invite members to a party if they are on your Real ID friends list or if they are on the same realm as you are.<br>
<br>
Q: Can I invite a friend of a Real ID friend?<br>
A: No, you can only invite those who are Real ID friends with you directly to the party.<br>
<br>
Q: How long will the testing period last?<br>
A: We haven&#x2019;t yet determined how long the testing period will last. We&apos;ll keep you updated on the status and inform you when the test period is going to end in the future.<br>
<br>
Q: Will aspects of the Real ID Party system be premium-based?<br>
A: We&apos;ll have information on the premium-based aspects of the Real ID Party system toward the end of the testing period.<br>

Season Transition Compensation Action<br>
For our lack of forewarning on the inclusion of new item level 371 gear with Season 10 we&#x2019;ll be providing the previously announced (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2794770941) 4000 Honor Point compensation during scheduled maintenance on July 19.<br>
<br>
During maintenance, 4000 Honor Points will be automatically applied to all characters that spent Honor on any item level 365 items following the release of 4.2, between the June 28 and July 5 maintenances.<br>
<br>
The compensation Honor Points given will be able to go over the point cap, but anyone who goes over will not be able to earn more Honor until they spend under the 4000 cap. Any Honor over the cap will need to be spent before the start of Season 11 when it will be converted to gold. Any characters receiving the compensation honor will also receive an in-game mail explaining the compensation and additional details.<br>
<br>
Again, we apologize for not communicating the item level 371 gear introduction, and hope these 4000 Honor Points will offer you some help in obtaining the correct items.</div></div>
