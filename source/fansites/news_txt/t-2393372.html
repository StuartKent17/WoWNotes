Pet Battle Updates in Battle for Azeroth<br>
Hello!<br>
<br>
We&apos;re currently hard at work implementing Battle for Azeroth&#x2019;s pet battle content, and we&apos;d like to start talking about some of the changes you&#x2019;ll be seeing in the Beta.<br>
<br>
Pet Battle World Quests will soon begin showing up on both of the new continents. Similar to Legion, they will count towards your zone&#x2019;s emissary, but this time around, the level of the pets opposing you will scale to the highest level pet on your team. This will allow a player with a team of only level 1 pets to take on the World Quest and get some battle pet experience. Please give them a shot with pets of all levels, and let us know how that goes for you.<br>
<br>
We will be introducing a new currency in Battle for Azeroth that can be used to purchase a variety of things, so there&apos;s no need to hold on to those Pet Charms that are burning a hole in your pocket.<br>
<br>
Several new pet battle mechanics are coming to Battle for Azeroth. Some of these will appear on enemy pets, and some on yours. A few examples include:<br>
<br>
A powerful spell that summons a random Weather effect<br>
Several additions to suite of Heals that will have increased effects based on your pet&#x2019;s health<br>
Aura effects that heal your pet (or damage the enemy pet) based on the last hit dealt<br>
<br>
<br>
In addition to new pets and abilities, we&#x2019;re making a few targeted changes to a few pets and abilities that are seen frequently: <br>
<br>
Bone serpent: swapped positions of Call Darkness and Lift Off Crow and Gilnean Raven: -200 power, +200 speed Cyclone: damage changed from 7 to 3-7 Haunt: returns the pet at 50% health when sacrificed instead of 100%.<br>
Teroclaw Hatchling: Dodge and Nature&apos;s Ward now occupy the same tier (as do Hawk Eye and Ravage).<br>
<br>
<br>
Please feel free to let us know how the changes play for you.<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>
<br>
will current pet upgrade tokens still work on BFA pets?<br>
Yes.<br>

1v1 Queued PvP content<br>
I think a lot of players, myself included, would really enjoy any system that lets us que for nonrated 1v1 PvP either from the honor tab like you would a skirmish or a place out in the World you could que at something akin to the Brawler&apos;s guild but for PvP. You would want to offer a minimal reward for this style of content so players who find it aggravating don&apos;t feel compelled to do it. <br>
You know, we have an unannounced feature that may just be up your alley... (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20762327978?page=1#3))<br>
<br>
Large Battleground Queue<br>
Our thoughts are that queuing for a large battleground like Alterac Valley or Isle of Conquest is opting-in for a different experience than all the other battlegrounds, in the sense of the larger 40 vs 40 scale and the longer duration time. That&apos;s the main motivator for moving them to a separate queue.<br>
<br>

<br>
While we have no immediate plans to change the gameplay of AV or IoC, its not out of the realm of possibility. Certainly with them being in their own queue gives us the opportunity to tweak them separately. We also would like to re-introduce other larger scale maps from the past into the playlist over time.
