chaud2019-02-18, 11:11 AMPatch 8.1.5 PTR - Zandalari Troll Embrace of the Loa Shrines
The Zandalari Troll racial ability Embrace of the Loa https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/292752-embrace-of-the-loa now requires your Zandalari troll to use the ability in front of one of the Zandalari loa shrines around Dazar'alor. This grants you the buff of the loa and will remain until you replace it with another loa shrine. This activates a 5 day cooldown during which you cannot change the buff. You can talk to guards in Dazar'alor to get the specific shrine marked on the map.
