Boubouille2011-04-14, 08:33 PMPatch 4.1 - PTR Build 13875
A new build is being deployed on PTRs and they will apparently be brought back online. The downtime was most likely the result of a ... small problem with one of the latest Mac build and doesn't mean the patch will hit live servers sooner than we thought.
