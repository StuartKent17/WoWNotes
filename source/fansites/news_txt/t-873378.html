Unholy<br>
<br>
Desecration (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/55667/desecration/) no longer triggers when an applicable strike hits a snare-immune target. This is primarily to avoid unnecessary spell effect clutter during boss encounters.<br>
<br>
<br>

Enhancement<br>
<br>
Improved Fire Nova has been redesigned and replaced by a talent called Seasoned Winds (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/16544/seasoned-winds/). When an enemy spell cast is successfully prevented with Wind Shear (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/57994/wind-shear/), the shaman gains magical resistance (in an amount equal to what a protection totem/aura would grant, stacking with such buffs) to the spell school(s) of the interrupted spell (except for Holy spells), lasting 10 seconds.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br>
Dire Maul North (http://www.wowpedia.org/Dire_maul)<br>
<br>
The Gordok Courtyard Key (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/18266/gordok-courtyard-key/) in Fengus&apos;s Chest is now replenished after several seconds.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Mechanar (http://www.wowpedia.org/Mechanar)<br>
<br>
The Cache of the Legion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/30438/cache-of-the-legion-key/) now unlocks when Gatewatcher Gyro-kill is gyro-killed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Stratholme (http://www.wowpedia.org/Stratholm)<br>
<br>
Postboxes no longer require keys to open, because really, who locks their postboxes anymore when they&apos;re all undead? It&apos;s just people sending coupons for brains anyway.<br>
The Postmaster now spawns when 3 of any postbox are opened.<br>
<br>
<br>
Uldaman (http://www.wowpedia.org/Uldaman)<br>
<br>
The Staff of Prehistoria (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/7733/staff-of-prehistoria/) is no longer required to open the door in the Map Room.<br>
Baelog&apos;s chest has been given new loot. If it&apos;s grey it&apos;s good, right?<br>
<br>
<br>
Zul&apos;Farrak (http://www.wowpedia.org/Zul%27Farrak)<br>
<br>
Troll Cages no longer require the Executioner&apos;s Key (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/8444/executioners-key/) to open.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guilds<br>
<br>
The amount of guild experience rewarded for rated Battleground guild group wins has been dramatically increased.<br>
Players are now rewarded guild experience for Honorable Kills in the field.<br>
Players are now rewarded guild experience for Battleground wins in Battleground brackets up to level 80.<br>
Arena teams are now awarded guild experience for wins. The entire team must be members of the same guild to earn this experience.<br>

<br>
PvP<br>
Arenas<br>
<br>
The Ring of Valor (http://www.wowpedia.org/Ring_of_Valor) has returned! It should now be playable again in the Arena map rotation.<br>
New starting areas have been added for Ring of Valor. Players will no longer enter the Arena on the elevator. It&apos;s been removed. Instead players will start in a room at opposite ends of the Arena.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quests &amp; Creatures<br>
<br>
Loot from the creatures Garr (http://www.wowpedia.org/Garr), Julak-Doom (http://www.wowpedia.org/Julak-Doom), Mobus (http://www.wowpedia.org/Mobus), and Poseidus (http://www.wowpedia.org/Poseidus) has been adjusted to be commensurate to their rarity and invested effort.<br>
<br>
<br>
User Interface<br>
<br>
The Guild Finder has been implemented! While we are continuing to add final polish to this feature, we welcome all focused testers to give it a go. Feedback can be provided here.</div></div>
