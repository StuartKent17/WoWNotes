Legion - 3.3 Million Copies Sold
Blizzard published sales numbers for Legion, with the total copies sold on Day 1 matching Warlords of Draenor and Cataclysm: 


The Burning Crusade - 2.4M First Day, 3.5M First Month
Wrath of the Lich King - 2.8M First Day, 4M First Month
Cataclysm - 3.3M First Day, 4.7M First Month
Mists of Pandaria - 2.7M First Week
Warlords of Draenor - 3.3M First Day
Legion - 3.3M First Day


With Azeroth on the brink of destruction, heroes from around the world were summoned to drive back the Burning Legion’s armies last week with the launch of World of Warcraft®: Legion™, the sixth expansion to Blizzard Entertainment’s acclaimed massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Today, Blizzard announced that players have forged a truly formidable defensive front—as of the expansion’s first full day of launch on August 30, more than 3.3 million copies of Legion had sold through, matching the all-time record achieved by previous expansions and making it one of the fastest-selling PC games ever. In addition, World of Warcraft’s launch-week player concurrency climbed to its highest point since the 2010 launch of the Cataclysm expansion, as champions from around the world united to strike a mighty first blow against the fel invaders. But the battle has only just begun. 

“It’s been a thrill to see players hunting demons, powering up Artifacts, and freely exploring all the new zones in Legion,” said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. “We worked hard to make this the best World of Warcraft expansion yet, and we look forward to providing players with even more content as Legion’s epic story unfolds in the months ahead.”

While players are currently entrenched against the first wave of demonic invaders, Legion’s next exciting chapter is already in the works. Last weekend at PAX West, Blizzard unveiled new details on the expansion’s upcoming first major content update, Patch 7.1: Return to Karazhan, featuring a reimagined version of one of World of Warcraft's most popular raids. Players will explore a sprawling five-player Mythic dungeon, facing familiar foes from Karazhan’s past—and encountering plenty of surprises and twists along the way. The update also features a new set of quests unfolding over multiple weeks in the fallen night elf city of Suramar, as well as a brand-new raid: the Trial of Valor, which sends players deep into the vrykul underworld of Helheim. 


Patch 7.0.3 Hotfixes - September 7
Classes

 Hunter Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 

Barrage  now fires in a tighter cone, and its visual has been improved to better show its area of effect.

Developers’ Notes-- Barrage fulfills a fantasy of a wild spray of shots in a large area. Of course, that can be dangerous, and often Hunters accidentally pull additional enemies with Barrage, especially in Legion dungeons. We saw this as a failure on our part to convey what it actually does. This hotfix should allow Hunters to get a feel for the shape and size of it and build a reliable expectation of what will happen when they cast Barrage. No change was made to Barrage’s damage. We hope that this helps Hunters and their groupmates to have a more pleasant dungeon experience.

Will there be class tuning in 7.0.3?
Yep! We'll continue to adjust class tuning as needed, and are closely monitoring how each spec is performing. WarcraftDevs

Why doesn't Mark of Ursol count as AM for mechanics like first boss of Vault of the Wardens? Odd to use Ironfur vs magic dmg
We focused on consistency for that type of check in Legion, but agree that Mark of Ursol seems weird. Will discuss! WarcraftDevs

Ignite is spreading to neutral targets during combat. Intended? Makes for interesting fights in Eye of Aszhara
Yes, Ignite intentionally spreads very aggressively. Playing with fire can be dangerous! WarcraftDevs

Hey guys, can you pls confirm if Driven to Madness Talent is supposed to only work outside VF
Intentional. Driven to Madness only grants Insanity from non-periodic damage taken outside of Voidform. WarcraftDevs

if we active the orbs & down kosumoth to unlock the WQto get the pet this week will we have to do it again to get the mount?
Nope, once you're attuned, you're attuned. Muffinus

did you increase the honor level required for 840+ rewards? back to 805 after seeing 840 for a bit.
Works like all other world quest rewards. They are not predetermined. But your chance at better loot increases with honor level. holinka 

Loving Legion, great job so far. Can you confirm the ilvl threshold that you must be over to get the small % stat increase? 850?
800 holinka

Can Oddly Shaped Stomachs go in leatherworking bags please?
Good suggestion. This will be fixed in Patch 7.1. WarcraftDevs 

is infernal brimstone WQ supposed to be weekly or daily? Killed that should be up today but nothing popped up.
On average, you'll see it every three days. This is also true for the Felwort, Felhide, and Bacon World Quests. WarcraftDevs 

will professions continue to upgrade past 850 with new content patches or is that going to be limit for gear from them?
Yep. In fact, we plan to increase the Obliterum cap to 855 in Patch 7.1. WarcraftDevs 

Rank 3 Skinning providing no improvement over Rank 1. Intended?
Ranks 2 and 3 both give a chance at an additional skin/scale. Rank 2 also gives a chance for Blood of Sargeras. WarcraftDevs
