Legion - Magni, Eitrigg, and The Ashbringer
We found some interesting conversations with important NPCs about Artifact weapons. One example is a conversation you can have with Magni or Eitrigg about The Ashbringer. Unfortunately there isn't much more than what is below yet. Keep in mind that this is just a reference in an alpha build of Legion, not something final or officially announced.

Magni Bronzebeard and The Ashbringer
Well if ain't the Highlord $Ghimself:herself;! I reckon' it's good for even the hardiest of us to take a moment and reflect now and again. I'm right fond of this spot. 
Take a seat with me for a moment, won't ye? 
The Ashbringer is a truly wondrous blade, ain't it? I remember forging it many years ago back in Ironforge - my finest work. 
If ye don't mind an old dwarf talkin' yer ear off, I'd like to share a piece of advice with ye that I've carried with me since I was a lad. 
We all come from the same earth and stone around us; Alliance and Horde, dwarf and gnome- as a leader, ye've got to see past the differences and unite yer people against the Legion. Azeroth depends on it. 
I'll give ye some time alone. Just somethin' to think about in the days ahead. 

Eitrigg and The Ashbringer
Throm-Ka, Highlord $p. I see we both value some peace and quiet now and again. 
Sit with me if you would - just for a few moments. 
Tirion was my brother by blood. We saved one another's lives many moons ago. He was a good man... an honorable man. 
He always thought highly of you - from what I hear from others his trust has not been misplaced. 
I have watched many lead their people down dark paths. Tirion often spoke of the Light that guided his hand and his people - let it guide you to greatness as well. 
I am not one for conversation - much remains to be done. May our paths cross again, $p.

Transmogrification
Will Rogues have the ability to mog their artifact weapons into other stuff?This being outlaws with axes and fist weps
You can transmogrify your artifact into other weapons within the current, existing transmogrification weapon-type rules. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/685267638847553536


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
Prestige based on luck has no real value. Give me prestige based on skill and/or dedication.
Neither skill nor dedication will provide an item that only a few players will own. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685553129270591488
Maybe having a super rare item like that just isn't feasible. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685553196710801408

Why in Cata post mortem you said Legendaries should not be like a reputation grind and Mists had 3 Rep grinds for Legendary?
Different legendaries. Cataclysm model was 1-2 per guild raid. Mists legendaries were for virtually everyone. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552086566633472
This is relevant to the discussion of rarity we've been having on twitter lately. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552256897318913
Say as a designer you want 1% of players to have an item for prestige or bragging purposes. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552450275639296
RNG is about the only tool in your box. along grind doesn't limit number of players, only the rate they acquire them. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552636209172480
Skill means the world first guilds have them and nobody else. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552706333720576
Systems to deliver rare rewards in the absence of low RNg-based drop rates are *very* hard to design. OccupyGStreet https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552935112060928
