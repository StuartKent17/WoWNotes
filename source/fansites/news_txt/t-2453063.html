Players with maximum-level (120) blood elves or dwarves who are Exalted with their faction (Silvermoon City or Ironforge respectively) will be able to embark on a new quest line for each race to learn more about their history. Once you complete your quest, you&#x2019;ll gain a new Heritage Armor transmog set unique to your race and be able to show off your pride.<br>

Begin your journey by visiting the embassy in Orgrimmar or Stormwind after Tides of Vengeance arrives on December 12.</div></div>
