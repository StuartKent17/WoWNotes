New Lore: &quot;Charge of the Aspects&quot; Story Available<br>
The Cenarion Circle&apos;s victory in the Firelands offers Azeroth a brief reprieve. With the elemental armies of Deathwing the Destroyer broken and the Twilight&apos;s Hammer still reeling from its loss in the Bastion of Twilight, the tide has finally turned in favor of Azeroth&apos;s defenders.<br>
<br>
Emboldened by these triumphs, the Earthen Ring, the Cenarion Circle, and the remaining Dragon Aspects have completed the ritual to heal the World Tree Nordrassil. Now, the three groups shift their attention and energies toward using Nordrassil to mend their shattered world.<br>
<br>
Their efforts may well be in vain, however, for they will soon see that they cannot afford to waste any more time before they deal with the true threat to Azeroth: Deathwing.<br>

I have murdered one of my own.<br>
<br>
The thought hit Nozdormu the Timeless One the instant he saw the desiccated bronze dragon. Zirion had shriveled into a husk half his original size. Lesions covered his body from head to tail. Instead of blood, golden sand cascaded out of the wounds in unending streams upon which shimmered ghostly images of his life that had not yet come to pass. His future was bleeding out of him.<br>
<br>
Nozdormu strode across one of the isolated peaks of Mount Hyjal to stand by Zirion&apos;s side, every moment of history rippling over the Timeless One&apos;s sun-colored scales. As he loomed over the dying dragon, a wave of helplessness flooded through him. An impenetrable veil had descended on the timeways, one that not even he, the Aspect of the bronze dragonflight and the Guardian of Time, could pierce. The past and future&#x2014;things he had once seen with clarity&#x2014;had become muddled.<br>
