Special Reclamation Rig Event - Source of Blueprint: Rustbolt Requisitions Found
Players have discovered that the Supercollider https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/153360-supercollider weapon created by the Toys For Destruction https://www.wowdb.com/quests/54090-toys-for-destruction quest today can activate a special occurrence during the reclamation rig encounter, awarding the Blueprint: Rustbolt Requisitions https://www.wowdb.com/items/168495-blueprint-rustbolt-requisitions needed for the Junkyard Architect https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13479-junkyard-architect portion of the Mecha-Done https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13541-mecha-done meta achievement. Sorry for the congested screenshots, but it is almost impossible on live servers to not have a ton of players doing this at the moment.


Completing the Toys For Destruction https://www.wowdb.com/quests/54090-toys-for-destruction quest today 4th time it's been up gives you the ability to use the Supercollider https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/153360-supercollider weapon during your time in Mechagon. This is an extra action button with a hammer icon that allows you to do damage to everything around you with a 5 second cooldown
During the Reclamation Rig construction event, there are normally 5 Irradiated Elementals https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/150825-irradiated-elemental that spawn every other wave during the first part of the encounter. Each of these needs to be hit with the Supercollider https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/153360-supercollider weapon to turn them into Unstable Irradiated Elemental https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/151049-unstable-irradiated-elemental, confirmed by them turning from green to red.
If all 5 elementals are hit in all 3 waves, the final phase of the encounter will spawn 3 Unstable Irradiated Golems https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/151053-unstable-irradiated-golem instead of the normal Neutronium Surges https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/150876-neutronium-surge. These mobs have slightly more health and are shackled fire slag elementals instead of green water elementals.
Completing this event after successfully following the above steps awards you with your normal rewards plus Irradiated Box of Assorted Parts https://www.wowdb.com/items/168395-irradiated-box-of-assorted-parts, Blueprint: Rustbolt Requisitions https://www.wowdb.com/items/168495-blueprint-rustbolt-requisitions, and a chance at the Echoing Oozeling https://www.wowdb.com/items/169396-echoing-oozeling battle pet.

Aqueous Reliquary Drop Confirmation
Can someone please confirm if the aqueous reliquary items drop from normal and heroic if you run both within the same week?
Yes, but you don’t have to do both to maximize your drops.


If you kill Azshara on Normal, you should get some of the drops x.
If you then kill Azshara on Heroic in the same lockout, you should get some more of the drops y.
If you skip Normal and go straight to Heroic, you should get the total number of drops x+y.


Killing Azshara on Heroic, then killing Azshara on Normal will result in no drops of those items on the second kill.

Having said that, we had a data error calculating Aqueous Reliquaries this week, and when we fix it, more will drop. To avoid impacting players who have already killed the bosses, we’re fixing it at the beginning of next week. Starting with next week’s raid reset, the amounts will be corrected.

Entrance to Eternal Palace
So it appears if you haven’t completed the questline in Nazjatar you cannot jump in the whirlpool to get to the raid entrance.
Just a quick FYI that we are looking into a change for this. Blue Tracker https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1106904-entrance-to-eternal-palace/ / Official Forums https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/221921/91

PSA: Do NOT Summon other Blingtrons to fight Bling7000!
So I hit Exalted with Rustbolt today and the first thing I did was learn the recipe for Blingtron 7000 and craft it.

I placed it down and announced it in general where it was, and figured, hey, why not summon the other blingtrons and let it kill them so it can get bigger to help it stand out more in the crowd?

Yea, big mistake. For some reason, Blingtron 7000 has 7000 health. Blingtron 5000 has 22,000 health and Blingtron 6000 has 55,000 health.

Needless to say, 7000 was destroyed by 5000 before I could even summon 6000. And now I have a 4 hour cool down before I can summon another one.
We’ve found the bug here and we’re working on a hotfix for it. Blue Tracker https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1106902-psa-do-not-summon-other-blingtrons-to-fight-bling7000/ / Official Forums https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/223057/18
