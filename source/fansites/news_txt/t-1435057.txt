Another PvP Season for Mists of Pandaria
It looks like that Season 15 gear  that was added "just in case" may see some use after all, with another PvP season coming before Warlords of Draenor. 


  


Update: Normal Difficulty Cross-Realm Siege of Orgrimmar
It looks like cross-realm normal difficulty may not be off the table after all!

Storage Space Issues
Even bandaid fixes for storage issues ie more void storage take time to develop and implement, so we'd prefer to spend that time working on solutions, like systems that hold your items and gear in new ways that don't actually use inventory slots. We announced the account-wide toy and heirloom systems at BlizzCon, as well as the ability to craft from your bank and bigger stack sizes for some items, and we've hinted at some slightly longer term plans for a gear collection/wardrobe feature that would help serve all the transmoggers out there in not just freeing up space but also providing the ability to easily track set collections - all of which will help in their own way with inventory management. While the toy and heirloom systems are planned for the launch of Warlords, the gear collection system will be a bit later. We expect the toy and heirloom systems will free up enough space for most people, as well as some albeit bandaid-y slightly larger bags in Warlords and attaching quest items to the quest log instead of as items to fill up your bags, will all help in the meantime.

Any idea if we will still be able to "use" Dartol's Rod of Transformation or Archmage Vargoth's Staff at will? The first one no longer has a quest associated with it. Will we get to keep it?

I've trashed most "toy" items, opting for transmog bag space. But I have no intention of getting rid of those 2 items, nor a few other old quest things I have.
We'll be handling each item on a case-by-case basis, and will be looking for everyone's help in identifying items that could/should be added to the toy box beyond the probably more obvious ones we already have flagged. It's largely going to be something solidified through testing and feedback. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

PvE
Pallytank here.My cotank is a warrior.He spamtaunts adds/bosses/doesnt care for tanking just dps.Superannoying and I can do little to stop him. Doesnt care ATALL for tanking,just pure dps.Will this get addressed?
When both tanks have that mindset, it can be quite fun. However, when they don't, it can be aggravating. The Vengeance change will make that no longer with doing. However, we want to improve cooperative tank gameplay so as not to lose that potential fun. Source 

Warlords of Draenor PvP
Can you talk about WoD BG-s? Are you guys adding new BG for WoD?
WoD release approach is improve existing BG experience and set foundation for faster creation/iteration. Big content is Ashran. Source 
Really looking forward to seeing objective based rewards and their visibility in the scoreboard/UI
Me too! Source 

Have you thought of making the achievement Grievous Combat and future achieves like it account wide once you earn? For gearing alts
no it was to help people gear multiple specs, which won't be necessary with WoD gear changes. You can expect to see that go away. Source 

Is the Grievous Combatant mount going away when the next PvP season starts or will it still be obtainable later? Thanks!
It won't be going away. Planning on a similar achievement each season and hopefully more mounts Source 

PvP
You can also be suspended for wintrading which uses the Enter Battle button. 
1. We have to have leave queue but it should be smaller and we should also allow you to accept while in combat. Source 
2. Playing every game should be made more efficient than tanking 10. "Deserter debuff" may be cleanest option. Source 
3. Don't believe everything you read on the Internet about suspensions. Source 
4. There will be no 5. Source 
Or "Leave queue" doesn't lose mmr for your team or gain MMR for the team you would've fought.
People leaving queues is not good for the game. When you enter a match, there should be an opponent. Source 
We need to enter arenas when dead. Sound setting so that JUST Q POP audible out of game?
You'll be able to accept queues with the same rule set as LFD with respect to combat Source 

can the battlegound achievements be account wide? Eg 100 wins of this bg, or disarm X bombs. Needs to be more alt friendly.
They already are, I believe. can you confirm? Source 
I don't believe progress is shared across characters but I don't believe that is unique to BG achievements. Source 

What do you think about cosmetic arena teams?
Could be fun if the party leader could "name" the temp team. Just isn't a priority right now. Source 
I miss being able to track comp stats... BTW when can we have arena game history back on armory?
It had a high storage requirement & was 1 of the least used features of the armory. Might explore for trial #nopromises Source 

revisiting this. Is it intended that the elite gear requires rating? Not the case last season.
Yes it's intentional. Last season it didn't have rating as original plan was to provide better stats. Source 

Professions
I really hate to rush somewhere, to pull something from other players' hands, when somebody pulling stuff from my hands
Competition for profession mats is an interesting situation. On one hand, we want them to feel natural, sometimes scarce. Source 
On the other, we don't want player collision to feel like a negative thing ideally a positive. Interesting discussion. Source 

Is there any chance to let people with crafting professions allowed to repair their armor? By making oils, patches etc.
It's been discussed internally on & off since I started during BC, and probably before that. Source 

Any changes coming to Archaeology? And will we see Archaeology and Garrisons have any interaction?
Current plan is 1. general quality-of-life tweaks think gathering in MoP & 2. garrison interaction we can't go into details yet. Source 

Future
Will Proving Grounds leaderboards ever happen? It'd be nice to not depend on wowprogress to make use of the score feature.
It's something we're interested in potentially doing, but I don't know when we'll be able to get to it. Would be easy to read it as an indicator of class/spec balance, when it's not intended to be. So, need to be careful. Source 

Any plans for pets that are tamed to keep special effects like Duskstalkers in jade forest with the shadowform?
Looking into tech that'll put visuals like that on display level and not an aura; not sure when it'll be ready & applied. Source 

Btw, next year, how about a Greench pet?
Wanted to 1st year but it's too complex! Needs new art. T_T Source 
What's wrong with the existing Greench model? Can't he just be shrunk down to battle pet size?
It's bad for same technical reasons the Personal World Destroyer isn't just a shrunken Fel Reaver. Source 

Transmogrification
How about the chance of adding daggers, and fist weapons to the one hand, sword/axe/hammer plate?
Same issues! Unlikely for both philosophical & technical reasons mostly animations. Source 

I wouldn't say a complete restriction lift, but plate should be able to xmog mail, mail xmog leather, etc. There is an old paladin mail set and hunters would look great in leather.
Sub-40 armor types are for sub-40 characters. TRIVIA: It's item-based, not class-based, so currently impossible anyhow! Source 

Reputation / Questing
Wow often gets accused of being faceroll. It's things like minimum quest levels that force it to be faceroll when it needn't be.
Things like minimum quest levels protect new players who don't know any better, though. What's easy for you is hard for others. Source 

World
I feel WoW needs immersion, how about random world bosses or bandits attacking towns or players on the road
Me too. Haven't seen many MMOs get it right though; often feels TOO random/irrelevant/annoying. T_T Source 

Ever think about doing more with Gallywix' Pleasure Palace? 
I was going to make the golf course playable w/ exploding balls of course but we ran out of time. T_T Would be fun to go back! Source
