You can see what class abilities are on the GCD in Battle for Azeroth on the WoWDB beta site 
Yeah, we agree that having racials on the GCD isn't feeling great. Having to press multiple buttons in a row that don't do anything but increase throughput isn't particularly engaging. While we can resolve that issue within the context of a spec's toolkit, racials as well as on-use trinkets add an extra layer on top of that. So, in an upcoming beta build likely next week, we'll be taking racials and on-use trinkets back off of the GCD.
