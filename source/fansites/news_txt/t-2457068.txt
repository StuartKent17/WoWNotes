Holy

Guardian Spirit should no longer activate from damage that cannot kill the target such as a Brewmaster’s Stagger.




Dungeons

The reputation and questing requirements to enter the Siege of Boralus and Kings’ Rest dungeons have been removed.
The Battle for Azeroth Dungeons weekly event should now display the proper rewards.
Temple of Sethraliss

The visuals for Galvazzt’s Galvanize beam should now be more responsive.



Player versus Player

The PvP quest “Against Overwhelming Odds” can no longer be completed while in a raid.

Developers’ Note: The intent of this quest is to incite aggression amongst players on the under represented faction throughout war mode. Allowing it to be completed in a raid focused too much of that aggression in one place in one large group. This change spreads the fight out into more parts of the world.

The weekly PvP Call to Arms quests can no longer be completed while in a raid, and do not count kills on players below level 120 or with the Honorless Target debuff active.
Resolved an issue that prevented players from earning the non-seasonal Challenger, Duelist, Rival, and Gladiator titles from Battle for Azeroth: Season 1 rank achievements.
Isle of Conquest

Siege Vehicles and Bombs no longer deal damage to enemy commanders.
