Raid Testing Schedule - August 8-9
On Thursday, August 8, and Friday, August 9, we will continue testing raid encounters in the Siege of Orgrimmar raid. We're moving on to 10-player Heroic testing at this time, and then 25-player mode as the PTR cycle progresses.

Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below for all Public Test Realms.

Thursday, August 8
Immerseus - 10 Player Heroic - 10:30 PDT 13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST
Norushen - 10 Player Heroic - 16:00 PDT 19:00 EDT, 01:00 CEST

Friday, August 9
Spoils of Pandaria - 10 Player Heroic - 10:30 PDT 13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST
Paragons of the Klaxxi - 10 Player Heroic - 16:00 PDT 19:00 EDT, 01:00 CEST

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.

Instead you did the exact opposite and went to a complete standstill. Main heroes mostly do nothing at all.
Characters like Garrosh and Jaina have a lot of presence in the 5.0 story. Now, you may not like them or wish we had included more. Source 

Wotlk had the highest integration of players to the story. Cata and mop had arguably none or really week.
We also heard criticism that Arthas turned up every time you opened a closet. Risked making him feel more annoying than frightening. Source 

Real question, what is the intrinsic value of content? Story/Aesthetic difficulty matters less.
Seeing content and seeing story are both rewards. In WoW, gear just tends to be a more motivating reward for many. Source 

I have a feeling that y'shaarj is the true baddie in this expansion amirite?
He is dead. Source 
How can Old Gods die if "They're outside the cycle"?
"What is dead may never die?" Source 

stop saying u lose a leveling zone when u can phase for hight levels like u do on Theramor
Okay, so you're asking for Ashenvale to be phased at higher level to reinforce Alliance winning back some land? Source 

Just trying to understand how the ongoing story makes sense after changes such as this - esp for lower level toons
We often have a problem with the lower level time flow. Arthas is dead 1-60 then alive 61-80 then dead again 80-90. Source 
Why not turn TBC & WotLK into optional content that can be played in scenarios / cavern of times?
It's a neat idea. It just takes designer time away from other ideas which doesn't mean it's off the table. Source 

World
Can we get a list of to-be-joined servers in 5.4 so we can start matching guilds/arena teams up? Thanks!
There are no Arena teams any longer. We'll provide lists of connected realms when we have resolved which ones are affected. Source
