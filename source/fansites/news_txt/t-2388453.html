The WoW Remote Auction House will be deactivated on April 18, 2018. On that date, you will no longer be able to view Auction House listings or make Auction House transactions through the official WoW website or the WoW Armory app, and all links will be removed from our website. After April 18, you&#x2019;ll still be able to use the WoW Armory app for all other purposes, including accessing your character profiles, talent calculators, event calendars, and more.<br>
<br>
API &amp; Community Sites Unaffected<br>
<br>
Some World of Warcraft community sites make use of Blizzard&#x2019;s API to access Auction House&#x2013;related data, and we will continue to support for that. If you regularly visit a site that accesses data from the Auction House to keep an eye on the price of fish, you (and they) can continue to do so after April 18. Carry on fish-watching to your heart&#x2019;s content.<br>

Azeroth Auctioneers Need You<br>
<br>
In the meantime, eager auctioneers all over Azeroth are still available and conducting business as usual, so seek them out for all of your Auction House needs. Time is money, friend!</div></div>
