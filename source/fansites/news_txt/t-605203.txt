Boubouille2008-02-25, 06:52 AMNothing really exciting today, mostly because PTRs were brought down for a large part of the weekend because of a huge exploit allowing players to have "unlimited" stats. 

M'uru ... and Entropius ?
If you've been watching PTR raid progression closely, you probably know that the next boss to kill is M'uru. There isn't much progression on him for the moment, however there is something interesting in the game files : a boss named Entropius !

Now, take a look at the first screenshot and see if you notice something unusual between the two monsters ? Nothing ? Check the 2nd screenshot.

Of course that's some crazy speculation, but the similarities between the two monsters are really strange and it's not like Entropius could fit anywhere else in the Sunwell Plateau ... the next boss after M'uru being Kil'jaeden. Based on the information I've got I'd say that M'uru has been corrupted by Entropius, and you'll have to fight both of them in the Sunwell Plateau with Entropius appearing in a later phase of the fight.

Wrath of the Lich King - The Tuskarr
A few days ago, the official WotLK site has been updated with an article about Tuskarrs http://www.wow-europe.com/wrath/features/factions/tuskarr.xml.
Despite the absence of any records documenting the tuskarr's past, many significant facts have recently come to light.

The tuskarr are a kind-natured nomadic race that roams the southern coastlines of Northrend, guided by the carved cyclopean statues that mark their seasonal fishing routes. The tuskarr's tribal affiliation is evidenced by the sigils inscribed on their tusks, and although they are a peaceful race, they are constantly beset by taunka and local murlocs.

Yet even their enemies marvel at the tuskarr's prowess and fearlessness in catching some of the most dangerous creatures in Northrend's frigid waters, including whales and giant squid. Not even the unnamed leviathans that lurk in the ocean's depths are beyond the tuskarr's reach.

The tuskarr have seen their share of difficult times, but with the Horde's recent arrival they have found a new ally in the ongoing struggle against the hostile forces of Northrend.
