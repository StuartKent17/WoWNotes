5 New articles have been added to the site, most of the articles for the Patch 3.2 should be here now but I&apos;m still missing a few things that I will try to post in a few hours. The patch will most likely hit the live servers this week or the week after, I will obviously post as soon as I get a decent confirmation about that. <br>
