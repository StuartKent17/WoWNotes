New Hero Class: Demon Hunter<br>

Exhibiting superior mobility, great martial prowess, and a preternatural ability to detect demons.

<br>
Havoc: This damage-dealing specialization allows you to demolish any who stand in your way with fiery demonic attacks that emphasize rapid melee strikes and battlefield mobility.<br>

World Scaling<br>
<br>
Forge your own path through The Broken Isles. Level-up zones no longer have level ranges and instead creatures, foes, and rewards scale to your character level allowing you to play through those zones and their dungeons at any level. Zone and dungeon content will still be both challenging and rewarding at any level and allows you to play with friends seamlessly even if your levels are far apart. The max-level zone of Suramar awaits adventurers at the end of their journey.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
World Quests<br>
<br>
World Quests send players out on a variety of quests such as defeating world bosses, world PvP, special dungeon activities, crafting for a profession, story-driven content and more.<br>
World Quests become available for characters that reach level 110 and are displayed on the map to see what&apos;s available in each zone.<br>
World Quests rotate throughout the day and over longer periods of time as well.<br>
Emissary quests become available upon reaching level 110 as well. Emissary quests are a daily call for help from a specific faction in Legion.<br>
Completing missions in support of a faction from which you have an emissary quest awards a lucrative cache of loot.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revamped PvP Progression and Honor System<br>
<br>
Honor Points and Conquest Points have been removed as a currency. At level 110 players now receive Honor for completing PvP objectives or scoring Honorable Kills. Additionally, players at all levels who complete PvP battlegrounds are awarded a cache that can contain equipment, gold, and transmogrification tokens appropriate for their level along with artifact experience once they&#x2019;ve obtained their artifact weapon.<br>
Earning Honor increases your Honor Level. Increasing your Honor level unlocks Honor Talents which can provide passive bonuses and new abilities that are enabled whenever players engage in PvP combat (including out in the world).<br>
Players at Honor Level 50 can receive a special reward (a mount, a title, a pet, or a toy) and can Prestige. Electing to Prestige will increase the player&apos;s Prestige Level by 1, unlock a special PvP badge, and reset their Honor Level.<br>
Items that were purchased using Honor or Conquest are now available for purchase with Marks of Honor that can be earned from Battlegrounds, Arenas, and Skirmishes.<br>
Learn more about upcoming PvP changes in our Legion PvP Preview.<br>
<br>
Equalized PvP Gear<br>
<br>
Gear has been normalized in PvP combat. Characters entering a Skirmish Arena, Battleground, Rated Arena, Rated Battleground, or Ashran now receive an aura called Principles of War.<br>
Principles of War removes all stats gained from gear (Strength, Stamina, Haste, etc.), disables gear related bonuses (like trinket effects and set bonuses), and gives the character stats based on their specializations, and increases based on overall item level. The goal is to provide a much more finely tuned and balanced PvP experience.<br>
<br>
Arenas<br>
<br>
The pennant attached to the back of characters now changes its appearance based on the player&#x2019;s best rating in the Arena bracket.<br>
<br>
Battlegrounds<br>
<br>
Characters below level 110 winning a Battleground are now awarded Crates of Battlefield Goods. The crate contains a piece of armor appropriate for the character&#x2019;s level and specialization with a chance for the crate to contain additional rewards such as weapons or relics.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
New Transmogrification Collections System: Appearances<br>
<br>
New Collection tab: Appearances<br>
Unlock new appearances by collecting Soulbound weapons and armor your character can equip.<br>
Unlocked appearances are account-wide and usable for transmogrification by other characters that can equip the item.<br>
When first logging into a character after Patch 7.0, the appearances of appropriate items in your bags, bank, and Void Storage are learned automatically. Additional appearances will be unlocked based on previously-completed quests.<br>
Transmogrifiers located in most major cities have been improved with additional features.<br>
<br>
Got a look that you like? Save the entire transmogrification set as an outfit. Create and swap between outfits at the Transmogrifier.<br>
Additionally, transmogrifications can now be associated with your current specialization. Your outfit automatically changes when switching specializations if you so desire.<br>
Added a new option to hide shoulders.<br>
The option to hide helmets, cloaks, and shoulders has been moved into the transmogrification system.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
New Boosted Character Experience<br>
<br>
Newly boosted characters will receive a lesson on the basics of how to play their new class, as they embark on an airship heading towards the Broken Shore.<br>
<br>
Class Trials<br>
<br>
Try out a new level 100 character before consuming a Boost with the new Class Trials! Class Trials allows a player to create a new level 100 character, learn how to play the class, and get to experience what it feels like to play the class and their artifact weapon.<br>
At the end of the trial experience the character is saved but locked. Players can use a character Boost to unlock the character and keep the character permanently.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Raids and Dungeons<br>
Mythic Dungeons and Keystones<br>
<br>
Mythic difficulty is available for all Legion dungeons. Players who complete a Mythic dungeon may earn a Mythic Keystone pointing to a random Legion dungeon, enabling access to progressively more challenging levels of difficulty, with commensurate rewards.<br>
Completing a Mythic Keystone dungeon within the specified time limit awards a higher-level Keystone, pointing to a new random Legion dungeon, and allowing its holder to access an even higher difficulty and reward level.<br>
At higher Mythic levels, random modifiers are introduced, transforming the rules of the dungeon and the way you play to provide a dynamic experience.<br>
At the beginning of each weekly instance reset period, players receive a special reward based on the highest Mythic level completed in the prior week.<br>
<br>
Legacy<br>
<br>
Ruins of Ahn&#x2019;Qiraj now resets daily instead of every 3 days.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Items and Itemization<br>
Itemization<br>
<br>
In an effort to reduce the amount of gear swapping between specializations, the following changes have been made.<br>
<br>
Legion cloaks, rings, and items worn on the neck are no longer tied to a specific primary stat, and will remain relevant between specializations.<br>
Spirit and Bonus Armor have been removed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Multistrike has been removed. Items that had multistrike have had it replaced with another secondary stat.<br>
Trinkets obtained from Raids, PvP, and world drops in Warlords were overtuned and have been brought back to intended power levels.<br>
Set bonuses for item sets from expansions prior to Warlords of Draenor have been deactivated, though the text describing their former function still remains.<br>
<br>
Legendary Items<br>
<br>
Legendary items drop from places all throughout Legion. In addition to stats, these items confer powerful effects and modify abilities. Only a limited number of them can be equipped at a time.<br>
Check out the new Loot tab in the Dungeon Journal to see which Legendary items are out there for you!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Character Changes<br>
Specialization System Changes<br>
<br>
Characters can now change between any of their specializations at most any time for a progressive gold cost. Action bar configurations are saved for each specialization. As a result, Dual Specialization has been removed.<br>
Characters can queue up as any role that is available to their class and will automatically switch to the suitable specialization when entering the Dungeon, Raid, Battleground, or Arena without any gold cost. For example, a paladin might be questing as Retribution but queue up in Dungeon Finder as a Tank. When the paladin enters the dungeon, they will automatically switch to Protection.<br>
<br>
Updates to Combat Visuals and Audio<br>
<br>
Updated and improved on the animations, visual effects, and audio on core combat interactions like auto-attacks as well as many melee class abilities.<br>
<br>
Talent System Changes<br>
<br>
Players are now able to switch talents while out of combat without the need for reagents.<br>
<br>

Equipment limits on the amount of crafted gear that can be worn have been removed.<br>
