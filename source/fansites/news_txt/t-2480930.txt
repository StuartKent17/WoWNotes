Whether you’re exploring Azeroth with your closest friends, pushing the payload with trusted allies, or engaging in a friendly duel at the Tavern, your favorite games can feel like a home away from home. For a handful of days every year, the bonds people forge online manifest IRL at BlizzCon, as people from all walks of life converge in Anaheim to celebrate a shared love of games.

This year, we have some exciting updates designed to make the BlizzCon experience even more epic and memorable for everyone joining us—including a broader range of ticketing options and some new activities for attendees to rally around.

An Epic Welcome
We’re kicking things off a day earlier this year with what we’re calling the BlizzCon Pregame Festivities, a “Welcome to BlizzCon” get-together in the plaza outside the convention center on Thursday, October 31, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. PDT. This casual gathering will give everyone a place to meet up and hang out with friends, enjoy food and drinks, and do a /readycheck before the main event begins Friday morning.

We’re also making room for more indoor activities this year by expanding the show into Hall E on Friday and Saturday. If you’ve been to BlizzCon before, that’s usually where registration and the BlizzCon Store resides—this year, the store’s heading to the North Hall, registration is moving off-site nearby, and we’re recapturing the Hall E area to make room for some BlizzCon fun. We’ve got some playful plans in the works for that space, so stay tuned for more information.

And as always, BlizzCon 2019 will feature everything you’ve come to expect from the convention—the epic opening ceremony, developer panels across multiple stages, the Community Night contests, hands-on demos, world-class esports competition, and much more!

A Trio of BlizzCon Options
As BlizzCon has expanded and evolved, we’ve heard from guests and attendees that they’d be interested in more options and conveniences for navigating the show and exploring at a different pace. With that in mind, we’re adding a new ticket—the BlizzCon Portal Pass—available in limited quantities in addition to the BlizzCon Pass and Benefit Dinner options. Here’s a breakdown of all three:

BlizzCon Pass  – This is the core BlizzCon ticket you know and love, and what most BlizzCon attendees will want to go for. The BlizzCon Pass provides the same full general-admission access as in previous years, along with access to Thursday’s BlizzCon Pregame Festivities. You’ll also get the BlizzCon in-game goodies to be announced, along with your choice of this year’s BlizzCon Commemorative Collectible, which you can read more about below. Learn more about the BlizzCon Pass 

BlizzCon Portal Pass  – New for 2019! – The BlizzCon Portal Pass is your gateway to an array of extras, including access to the Darkmoon Faire area on the eve of BlizzCon for a special “Night at the Faire.” It also comes with convienct perks such as preferred parking, separate registration and security lines, an option to be among the first to enter the show on Friday and Saturday, a dedicated lounge for taking a load off during BlizzCon, and more. Learn more about the BlizzCon Portal Pass 

BlizzCon Benefit Dinner  – Returning for 2019, the BlizzCon Benefit Dinner gives you a chance to meet and chat with developers, artists, and other folks from Blizzard the night before the show at a laid-back charity dinner—all for an exceptional cause. Your BlizzCon Benefit Dinner purchase also comes with entry to BlizzCon and all of the BlizzCon Portal Pass perks. As in past years, the net proceeds from the BlizzCon Benefit Dinner go to benefit CHOC Children’s , whose mission is to nurture, advance, and protect the health and well-being of children. Learn more about the BlizzCon Benefit Dinner 

And of course, for those who can’t make it to Anaheim in person, there will be ways to watch BlizzCon online, as well as get this year’s commemorative in-game goodies. We’ll share more information on our plans for experiencing BlizzCon at home in the future, so stay tuned.

BlizzCon 2019 Commemorative Collectible – Celebrating 25 Years of Warcraft®
BlizzCon 2019 just so happens to coincide with a very special anniversary. This year, we’re celebrating 25 years of the Warcraft universe, and to mark the occasion we’re giving away something uniquely Azerothian to BlizzCon attendees.

In place of the usual BlizzCon Goody Bag we’ve given out in the past, this year’s BlizzCon-goers will receive their choice of a special, premium BlizzCon 2019 Commemorative Collectible —either an Orc Grunt statue or Human Footman statue—representing a quarter century of conflict and camaraderie, but mostly conflict.

We’ll be producing quantities based on what people choose—so to accommodate production deadlines and have everyone’s statue ready in time for pickup at BlizzCon, you’ll need to decide which statue you want at the time you purchase your tickets. For those who might want to own both, the statues will be available for purchase separately during a limited pre-order window starting May 4, the same day as the first ticket sale.

Check out our BlizzCon 2019 Commemorative Collectible preview  to get a closer look and learn more about making your selection.

This year’s BlizzCon is shaping up to be an epic one. Whether you hail from Taipei, Tristram, Kansas, or King’s Row, we can’t wait to welcome you back home!


BlizzCon 2019 Commemorative Collectible Celebrates 25 Years of Warcraft
November 2019 marks the 25th anniversary of the Warcraft® universe, and instead of doing a typical BlizzCon® Goody Bag as we have in past years, we’d like to commemorate the occasion by providing BlizzCon attendees a distinctly Azerothian memento.

We’re excited to announce that everyone who buys a ticket to attend this year’s BlizzCon will receive their choice of a special BlizzCon 2019 Commemorative Collectible—one of two premium statues in the style of the Blizzard Legends series, celebrating a quarter century of Warcraft’s timeless central conflict. Take up arms alongside the mighty Orc Grunt, or side with the bold Human Footman!

IMPORTANT! You’ll need to decide which statue you want at the time you purchase your tickets on May 4 or May 8. We’ll be producing quantities for pickup at BlizzCon based on what people choose, and locking in your selection now helps us ensure we’ll have everyone’s statue ready in time for the show!


  

Zug zug! Mark the 25th anniversary of Warcraft with this mighty axe-wielding Orc Grunt.


  

Ready for action! Honor the legends of Azeroth with the fierce and noble Human Footman.

Since statue choices are locked in at the time of ticket purchase, make sure to sync up with family and friends in advance to determine which one everyone wants. BlizzCon attendees will pick up their preselected statues with their badges at the show—and keep in mind that if you choose to transfer tickets find out more, the selected statue will stay connected to that ticket.

In addition, anyone who wants either statue or both! will be able to purchase the Orc Grunt and Human Footman for a limited time on the Blizzard Gear Store starting May 4. Statues purchased during this window will be shipped directly to your home around the time of BlizzCon. Stay tuned for more details.

Here’s to 25 years of Warcraft—we’re looking forward to celebrating with you at BlizzCon!
