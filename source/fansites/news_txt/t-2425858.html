The journey to bring two new Allied Races&#x2014;Mag&#x2019;har orcs (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21701413) and Dark Iron dwarves (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21701413)&#x2014;into the fold has begun in Kul Tiras and Zandalar.<br>

Expulsom Sources<br>
I am trying to level jewelcrafting but it requires 2 expulsom to craft a single gem. It is a long way to 150 when expulsum is, seemingly, so rare. How do you guys manage to gather larger amounts of this stuff? I&apos;ve scrapped a ton of gear with only a few expulsom as a result.<br>
Personally I&apos;ve managed to obtain, most of the Expulsom from scrapping gear, especially trinkets, that I would not use or were a downgrade for my character. If you see a world quest that offers a trinket, go for it, as it may offer you an Expulsom material - that excludes crafted trinkets. You can also manufacture it if you have the Alchemy profession. So maybe level that profession up, along with your Jewelcrafting?
