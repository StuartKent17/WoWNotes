Unholy Death Knight Gold Trait Feedback
The gold trait should be changed in an upcoming PTR build to something that doesn't add Festering Wounds and therefore resources and GCDs to the rotation, since Unholy is still a bit swamped. Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753226078?page=21#417

Intimidating Roar
While I am somewhat loath to respond to a thread where 23 of 25 posts are by the same person and I apologize in advance to my colleagues from Community about this, it turns out that this is being changed in 7.2. Intimidating Roar will root targets rather than snaring them by 50%. We felt the current behavior was inconsistent with the tooltip, and also that the talent shouldn't feel like it adds risk to the ability that isn't present in the untalented version.

Frost Mage Feedback
Thanks for the detailed look. We agree there could be some cleanup around proc minutiae and Winter's Chill timing, including getting rid of the possibility of the double Ice Lance.

Few other minor notes:

Frozen Touch is slightly underpowered, but we likely have to be careful with it until we do something about the possibility of infinite Thermal Void rotations.
Glacial Spike is intended to double-dip crit on the Icicle portion of the damage, but it would be better if it didn't double-dip % damage buffs such as the ones you mentioned.
Glacial Eruption should be on PTR soon, but it will be able to Shatter.

Outlaw discussion: RTB and True Bearing
Overall it would be more ideal if the RTB buffs were closer in value. True Bearing has gradually crept up over the course of the expansion around the time of Legion launch, I believe Shark Infested Waters was considered best, and they haven't changed much since then. I expect True Bearing climbs in value as the rotation gets faster due to stat increases and other bonuses being added over the course of the expansion, which all feed into the True Bearing positive feedback loop. Simply making it baseline would speed up the spec even further and contribute to the energy flood and other issues that it can have. While the similar effect was passive in Warlords, I'm sure I haven't dug into this closely that the Legion spec churns combo points much more rapidly. In any case the Legion version of True Bearing has the added synergy with Marked For Death that heaps even more combo points into the rotation during True Bearing.

Point being, while there's not a specific plan yet for balancing out the different RTB buffs, we agree that it would be better they were more even again. Longer-term, there's something to be said for tweaking the rules/probabilities of RTB in a way that would further reduce the value of rerolling frequently.

Loaded Dice: New Outlaw Gold Trait Feedback
Sigma already said they will make Loaded Dice give Slice and Dice some sort of buff, we have it in writing.
This should be in the next PTR build. Official Forums http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20752642780?page=4#75

Affliction Feedback
We do agree that Affliction should feel most at home when it is applying DoTs to multiple targets. With specs like this where the basic mechanics and history of the spec lean towards being strong in one area, there's often a fine line to draw on how it should perform in the other areas here, single-target damage. It shouldn't feel useless, but should feel like other players may have the advantage there. It's fine for a talent like Malefic Grasp to exist, but this logic probably implies it's slightly stronger than would be ideal. It's good feedback on the preliminary T20 set bonuses that they might push Affliction _away_ from feeling good when multi-dotting, which is something we'd want to avoid.

More broadly and looking ahead to the future, we agree that different specs--especially different specs within a pure DPS class--should have better delineated distinct strengths than they currently have in some cases. That doesn't mean the magnitude of the difference has to be very large see the "useless" comment above. Especially in a context like single-target DPS, which is the subject of intense analysis and scrutiny, even a few % of difference in DPS is more than enough for players to notice and take seriously as a strength or weakness of a spec. Simply that it should be more clear what the scenario is that each spec has to look forward to as the place where it stands out, such as sustained multi-dotting for Affliction, or situations that allow Destruction to leverage Havoc especially well.

Classes
Can we have HD skins for old Hippogryph colorations and maybe some tamable snowy or ebon gryphons?
There will be tameable black and white gryphons, but you will have to find them. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/832000274621362177
Tome of the Hybrid Beast http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/147580-tome-of-the-hybrid-beast: Would be cool if this unlocked another "page" of stable slots. Or put it on vendor.
Probably worth noting, Feathermanes include: Gryphons, Hippogriffs, Owlcats, Wolfhawks, and Wyverns most NYI atm Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/831985228914659329
any chance the Corrupted Hippogryph model could be added as a tame? would suit the expansion perfectly 
If you can find it Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/832016345503981568

So the paladin class mount is Rivendare's purified mount but the DKs already got that mount for the four horsemen.
Death Knights obtain the saddle of Rivendareâ€™s mount, but not the mount itself just like Arthas' saddle doesn't mean Invincible Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/832007833600135168

Artifacts
Reflecting on Artifact Power so far in Legion, and discussing upcoming changes: https://t.co/szjdGDispE NA, https://t.co/pk79BJi5wm EU WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/832304093913763842
This is a clever way of saying that you disagree with player's accounts of their psychology; right or wrong there'll be blowback
No one can contradict someone else's emotions or thoughts. People feel what they feel. We're trying to mitigate the impact. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/832353826690658304

Character / Items
Can you confirm that there is no benefit in repeating the "Touch of a Titan" Quest when having all legs upgraded to 940 ?
Correct. These items will never have a use other than upgrading a 910 Legendary to 940. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/832327031886999552

Well we be able to equip more then 2 legendarys? In 7.2 or later?
Not in 7.2. Potentially later, but undecided. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/832328668324130816

PvP
can't find a clear answer on this. I'm currently prestige and honor capped. Will my honor gained pre cap be stored up or be lost?
It is not stored holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/831876590808076289

Good to see some changes, could you also fix the bottom pillars of Blade's Edge as they currently ignore LoS
7.2 holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/832827799652036608

will honor earned before 7.2 adjust retroactively when the patch goes live e.g. Rank 5 players boost to Rank 10?
No. This change does not apply to all prestige levels, only the first 50 honor levels aka Prestige 0. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/833343728769064961

Pets and Pet Battles
One single pet requires a fully-unlocked Artifact? This doesn't bode well for completionists.
The time from empowerment to 51-point completion isn't as long as you think, don't worry Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/832018705194242048
So it's not unreasonable for a completionist to knock out all 36 specs as a relatively casual player?
For pet collectors, there are only 4 pets. Keep in mind that each alt/alt spec goes faster, too. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/832022414082969600
Oh, so there's not a class pet for each class - just the DK and Monk pets? That makes it a bit easier.
Correct. Some classes get pets, some get multiple colors, some get color-changers, DHs get a Pepe, etc. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/832023889110724608

So. Just going to put this out there...I sincerely hope these class pets are not Legion exclusive and will NOT be removed come next expac.
No plans to remove them Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/832034459138428928

Reputation / Questing
Any plans to lower the requirement for raid quests like Essence of Power for Emerald Nightmare to Raid Finder difficulty?
No. The Balance of Power chain is intended to reward organized raiding. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/832362461596573696
only downside is it locks out the entire row of artifact appearences to all bar organized raiders. Includes legion hero & M15
Yeah, and it wasn't something that's indicated by the interface at all :\ Really not a fan of this approach.
We agree that it should have been clearer in-game; Patch 7.2 has some changes that make this more apparent. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/832363670113964032
But, to be clear, no plans to change the 2nd through 4th tints from being locked behind the 1st?
Not at this time. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/832364020497723393

Misc
The mount I've always wanted is _______. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/832367225994489856

With flying being added in 7.2, will the violent shaking bug that Thal'kiel does when on a flying mount get fixed?
Generally these are dealt with on a mount by mount basis. If you feel this way about a mount, please tell us! Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/832819231632748545
