Tides of Vengeance

The Horde and Alliance conflict may feel more distant right now, but that's all about to change.
Tides of Vengeance is the next update! 
Coming to the PTR by the end of the week!


New Content

The War Campaign continues.
Incursions are coming - Similar to Legion Assaults. Horde/Alliance forces will invade an area, turning off World Quests, and adding an objective for the area. 
New World Quests are coming.
Saurfang, Tyrande, and Vol'jin story lines will be advanced. 
Heritage Armor is coming for other races: Dwarves and Blood Elves. It is unlocked via a racial quest, Exalted and Max Level? You can log in, do the quest, and unlock it!
New Warfront - The Battle for Darkshore. Night Elves vs Forsaken. New Structures and Upgrades. Darkshore will have max level character content and zone updates.


Island Expeditions

Two New Island Expeditions - Jorundall Vrykul and Havenswood Gilnean City
Island Expeditions will have new events and enemies, more variety, holdouts that can be triggered, and Azerite Extraction points that you'll have to depend.
Island Expeditions will have major spawning improvements. Won't be uniformly blanketed by spawns. More clusters and hubs, more gaps, more navigability between hubs.


New Raids

Siege of Zuldazar

Different than any raid before. 
The enemy is the opposite faction, with separate faction experiences. 
Alliance start at the docks and climb the pyramid, eventually fighting King Rastakhan. 
The Horde will defend the city, starting outside. They fight towards Rastakhan, which will be the middle of the raid for them. They then fight Alliance forces down towards harbor, ending with Jaina. 
After completing the faction specific experience, you'll be able to experience the other 3 faction bosses. 
There are a total of nine new boss encounters.

Crucible of Storms

This raid has two bosses and is located under Stormsong Valley, 
It will be released after Zuldazar.
There will be supporting world content.


System Improvements

Class updates, new Azerite Traits, new profession recipes, Gnomeregan Pet Battle Dungeon, and more!
Team has learned from the Azerite Traits, current ones are a base level, more complexity coming. 
Map and Reputation improvements coming. 
Champion of Azeroth faction will be effectively account wide. 
Reputation restricted transmog items will have restrictions removed. 
Progress towards the X Number of Exalted reputations achievements will be account wide.
In the events following the raid, we should be able to recruit the Kul Tiran and Zandalari Allied Races. If you are Exalted with the Zandalari / Proudmoore and played through the War Campaign, that's enough, nothing additional to do.
