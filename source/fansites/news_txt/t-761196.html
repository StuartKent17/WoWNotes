07:00PM CEST - Someone very smart pointed out something very disturbing. Worgens already had Darkflight (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/68992/darkflight/), a temporary speed spell applying a Mod Speed to the character. So, why did Blizzard add that spell in this build?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Running Wild (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/87840/running-wild/) - Drop to all fours to run as fast as a wild animal.<br>
<br>
<br>
This spell doesn&apos;t apply a mod speed, and applies a &quot;Mounted&quot; aura to the player. It&apos;s a racial, and it&apos;s apparently a Level 20 spell. I don&apos;t want to say it yet, but that would explain why we never saw a model for the Worgen Mount.<br>
<br>
12:00PM CEST - Added Maelstrom continent map.<br>
11:25AM CEST - All classes changes are now available.<br>
10:00AM CEST - Added Racial changes, added Mounts &amp; Companion Pets.<br>
09:35AM CEST - Added Player and Guild Achievements<br>
