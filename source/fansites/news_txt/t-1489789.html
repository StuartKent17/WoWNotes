Warlords of Draenor doesn&apos;t really add more abilities to the game but will introduce perks for your existing abilities! Each level, from level 91 to 99, you get a random perk (that you don&#x2019;t already know). By 99, you learn them all, but different players will get them in a different order. <br>
<br>
Blizzard was kind enough to provide us with a list of all the perks currently available for each class. <br>
