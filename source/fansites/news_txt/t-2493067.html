<br>
Rise of Azshara Content Update Notes<br>
<br>
New Zone: Nazjatar<br>
<br>
During a high-stakes chase across the seas, the Alliance and the Horde are waylaid by an ancient enemy who&#x2019;s been lurking beneath the depths: Queen Azshara and her fearsome naga army. The naval forces of both factions are destroyed in the ambush, and the survivors find themselves stranded in the ancient naga domain of Nazjatar.<br>
<br>
Soon after they arrive in Nazjatar, Alliance heroes will come upon a new faction of deep-sea warriors, the Waveblade Ankoan, while Horde heroes will meet the Unshackled, a group of races who have escaped the naga&#x2019;s clutches. Both sides offer champions who offer their services as combat allies and grow in power over time as players prepare for their epic confrontation with Queen Azshara.<br>
<br>
Adventurers who are level 120 and have unlocked Battle for Azeroth World Quests, completing the quest &#x201C;Uniting Kul Tiras&#x201D; or &#x201C;Uniting Zandalar,&quot; will receive a summon from either Genn Greymane or Nathanos Blightcaller, kicking off the events that bring them to Nazjatar.<br>
<br>
<br>
Benthic Gear<br>
<br>
Increase your power with Benthic gear, new upgradable armor that can now be collected in Nazjatar. As you explore Nazjatar, you&#x2019;ll collect Prismatic Manapearls (https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1721-prismatic-manapearl)&#x2014;a soulbound currency that can be spent on Benthic tokens and upgrades. These bind-to-account tokens can be used to gain a piece of upgradable Benthic gear specific to your armor type (cloth, leather, mail, plate), starting at item level 385. With enough time and effort, players can dedicate their hard-earned Manapearls to upgrade pieces to ilvl 425, just shy of Heroic-level raid gear (ilvl 430). Harnessing the power of the sea, each piece of Benthic gear boasts a thematic bonus that activates in Nazjatar and the upcoming Azshara&#x2019;s Eternal Palace raid. These bonuses might provide effects that boost your damage, slow down your foes, or even increase your mount speed while adventuring through this perilous region. Put together pieces to create a powerful set for combat, collect a set optimized for exploration, or mix and match to have the best from both worlds.<br>
<br>
Prismatic Manapearls<br>
<br>
Defeating powerful enemies, completing quests, and plundering the treasures of Azshara&#x2019;s minions may yield Prismatic Manapearls (https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1721-prismatic-manapearl), concentrations of magical energy highly prized by Nazjatar&#x2019;s denizens. Spend this new currency on many different items within Nazjatar including Benthic tokens and upgrades for Benthic gear, pets, and a mount. Earn Prismatic Manapearls (https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1721-prismatic-manapearl) by completing a variety of activities such as World Quests and daily quests, looting treasure chests, and slaying rare enemies.<br>
<br>
New Zone: Mechagon Island<br>
<br>
Legends speak of a place off the craggy coast of Kul Tiras whose denizens have replaced blood and bones with bolts and brass: Mechagon, home of a society of mechanically augmented gnomes and their iron-fisted ruler King Mechagon. Heroes who arrive upon Mechagon&#x2019;s shores will soon meet Prince Erazmin and the Rustbolt Resistance, and after completing a series of new faction-based quests, they&#x2019;ll join their fight to overthrow Erazmin&#x2019;s tyrannical father and put an end to his mad designs.<br>
<br>
Players can rise in power and earn the trust of their new allies by participating in new daily quests and other activities unique to Mechagon. These include collaborative Construction Projects that allow players to contribute resources to create a variety of powerful constructs, including experimental weapons, flame turrets, a drill rig that can uncover a cave full of treasures, and more.<br>
<br>
After establishing a hub in Nazjatar and empowering their Heart of Azeroth, players will make their way to Mechagon by starting the quest &#x201C;The Legend of Mechagon (https://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/54088-the-legend-of-mechagon)&#x201D; which can be accepted by Alliance players in Boralus and Horde players in Dazar&#x2019;alor near each city&#x2019;s respective Flight Masters.<br>
<br>
<br>
Junkyard Tinkering<br>
<br>
As they traverse the zone, players will have access to Pascal-K1N6, a giant iron robot who will help players craft equipment, mounts, toys, consumables, and more in exchange for Spare Parts (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/166846-spare-parts) and Energy Cells (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/166970-energy-cell) found across Mechagon. Recipes to craft more items can be found around the island.<br>
<br>
Pocket-Sized Computation Device<br>
<br>
The Pocket-Sized Computation Device (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/167555-pocket-sized-computation-device) is a trinket that players can customize via three Punchcard Sockets, into which players can insert one Red, Yellow, and Blue Punch Card. Punch Cards can be collected by questing, exploring the Mechagon zone, and advancing through the new Mythic-only dungeon Operation: Mechagon. Players will receive their Pocket-Sized Computation Device (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/167555-pocket-sized-computation-device) after completing the &#x201C;Upgraded&#x201D; quest, available shortly after landing in Mechagon.<br>
<br>
<br>
New Raid: Azshara&#x2019;s Eternal Palace<br>
<br>
Battle against Nazjatar&#x2019;s worthiest champions, face down unfathomable monstrosities from the deep, and confront the legendary Queen Azshara herself in this sprawling 8-boss raid.<br>
<br>
Learn more about the bosses guarding Azshara&#x2019;s Eternal Palace here (https://worldofwarcraft.com/news/23034748/).<br>
<br>
Azshara&#x2019;s Eternal Palace Normal and Heroic difficulties will open on July 9, two weeks after Rise of Azshara goes live on June 25. Raid Finder Wing One and Mythic will open the following week on July 16.<br>
<br>
New Dungeon: Operation: Mechagon <br>
<br>
Level 120 players will unite with Prince Erazmin and the Rustbolt Resistance to help overthrow his deranged father and destroy his Mechoriginator doomsday device in this new 8-boss &#x201C;mega-dungeon.&#x201D; This Mythic-only instance will be open to players after they complete new faction-based quests for the Rustbolt Resistance. Great rewards await you in Mechagon, but bear in mind that gnome-crafted loot might have some surprising properties. . .<br>
<br>
Operation: Mechagon will open to players at the start of Season 3, July 9, after accepting the quest &#x201C;Operation: Mechagon &#x2013; The Mechoriginator.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Heart of Azeroth System Update: Essences<br>
<br>
Infuse the might of the Titans into your Heart of Azeroth with Essences. These powerful active and passive abilities allow you to customize your playstyle in a whole new way. Each Essence possesses a Major Power (usually a new active ability) and a Minor Power (which is always passive). The Heart of Azeroth has slots for one Major and two Minor Essences. Place an Essence in the Major slot to activate both its Major and Minor Powers, and place up to two in the Minor slots to activate their Minor Powers. Adapt to conquer any situation by applying or swapping them out within rest areas, cities, or when using items such as the Tome of Quiet Mind.<br>
<br>
Grow in power each time you unlock one of four ranks for your Essence. At Rank 1, an Essence&#x2019;s Major and Minor effects are available, while Rank 2 and Rank 3 enhance those Major and Minor effects. Rank 4 adds a flashier cosmetic effect to an Essence&#x2019;s Major Power, providing a distinctive appearance that will make its wielder stand out from the crowd. Earn Essences by completing specific activities, including PvP, raiding, or engaging in World Quests. Some Essences are specific to a role (damage dealer, tank, or healer), and some are usable by any role. After acquiring an Essence, you&#x2019;ll be able to hover your mouse over the Essence in the user interface to see information about the next rank and how to acquire it.<br>
<br>
Players will need to complete a new quest line to unlock the Heart Forge before infusing Essences into the Heart of Azeroth. This will unlock the Major slot, and will reward them with their first Essence. The two Minor slots will unlock at Heart of Azeroth levels 55 and 65 respectively. Players with a Heart of Azeroth below level 35 will have it raised to level 35 upon unlocking the Heart Forge.<br>
<br>
Level 120 players who have established their new hub in Nazjatar will be invited to join Magni at the Chamber of Heart in Silithus to start the new quest line to unlock the Heart Forge, beginning with the quest &#x201C;Essential Empowerment (https://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/55851-essential-empowerment).&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Mount Equipment<br>
<br>
Have you ever wished that your favorite mount could carry you across the water without sinking? Give most of your mounts more speed, daze prevention, a parachute, or water walking with mount equipment! Upon reaching level 100 on one character, a new mount equipment slot will become available in the Mounts interface on all characters. Mount equipment can be crafted by Enchanters, Tailors, and Leatherworkers and can be listed in the Auction House or purchased directly from the artisans themselves. Players that already have Water Strider mounts should check their mailbox for one free piece of water-walking mount equipment.<br>
<br>
Note that mounts do not benefit from mount equipment in battlegrounds or Arenas and that some do not benefit from mount equipment at all such as the Sky Golem.<br>
<br>
New Quests<br>
<br>
A host of new stories and adventures are now available across Azeroth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Magni Bronzebeard<br>
<br>
Mysterious magics have awakened across Azeroth. Among them are the essences of the five dragonflights, which Magni Bronzebeard suspects can unlock the full potential of the Heart of Azeroth. Level 120 players should heed Magni&#x2019;s call to continue the story and earn their first Essence, which grants a new, powerful ability tailored to their character&#x2019;s role (damage dealer, healer, or tank) or all roles.<br>
<br>
War Campaign: Stay of Execution <br>
<br>
Upon learning of Sylvanas&#x2019;s plans to execute Baine Bloodhoof for treason, the Alliance and the Horde send strike teams to infiltrate the Kor&#x2019;kron Barracks and rescue the noble tauren chieftain&#x2014;meeting up with an old orcish ally along the way.<br>
<br>
The latest episode of the War Campaign is available to level 120 players who have completed the previous chapters and finished the quest &#x201C;Clearing out the Cache.&#x201D; Speak to Lady Jaina Proudmoore or Lor&#x2019;themar in Nazjatar to begin this perilous mission.<br>
<br>
New Heritage Armor: Gnomes and Tauren<br>
<br>
Delve deeper into the lore of the gnomes and the tauren and unlock Heritage Armor that reflects their legacies. Level 120 tauren or gnome players who are Exalted with their faction (Gnomeregan or Thunder Bluff respectively) will be able to embark on a quest line that explores their race&#x2019;s history. Once completed, players will gain a new Heritage Armor transmogrification set usable by all their characters of the same race.<br>
<br>
Eligible gnomes and tauren can begin the quest by speaking with their race&#x2019;s ambassador in their faction&#x2019;s Embassy in Stormwind or Orgrimmar. Those seeking the tauren Heritage Armor will additionally to be tasked with freeing Baine in the War Campaign quest &#x201C;Stay of Execution&#x201D; (on any character on their account) before beginning their quest line.<br>
<br>
New Epic Battleground: Ashran<br>
<br>
Once home to a mighty ogre empire, the ruins of Ashran hold ancient artifacts infused with great power that could turn the tide of war. Return to Draenor and fight on familiar turf in a brand-new 40v40 Epic Battleground: Ashran.<br>
<br>
Starting at level 100, players can clash with the enemy faction on the main road of Ashran, carving a warpath into the enemy&#x2019;s stronghold. After either slaying 700 enemy reinforcements or successfully invading the stronghold, players will come together to bring down the enemy faction leader&#x2014;the Alliance&#x2019;s Grand Marshal Tremblade or the Horde&#x2019;s High Warlord Volrath. Collect Ancient Artifacts, Artifact Fragments, Class Spellbooks, and other items to improve your chances of victory. Gathering Artifact Fragments from fallen foes will allow you to summon elite allies, Fangraal and Kronus, to lead your faction&#x2019;s charge into battle.<br>
<br>
Players will find and be able to queue for Ashran in the Epic Battleground section of the Group Finder (default hotkey: i).<br>
<br>
New Island Expeditions<br>
<br>
Set sail and discover two new Islands: Crestfall and Snowblossom Village. New loot including armor, weapons, and pets awaits players, but beware: you&#x2019;re not alone. Faction rivals will want to hoard the spoils for themselves. Take them down!<br>
<br>
New Missions and Mechanics<br>
<br>
<br>
New Missions and Troops<br>
<br>
As you take the fight to the seas, your loyal followers will be with you every step of the way. You can now enlist Boat Captains and other skilled seafarers to fight your battles.<br>
<br>
Event and Holiday Missions<br>
<br>
Send out your followers to embark on new holiday- and event-themed missions. Spoils will include special currencies to spend during holidays and events, including Brewfest and Timewalking, along with rewards that are only available during those periods.<br>
<br>
Flying in Kul Tiras and Zandalar<br>
<br>
The once-forbidden skies of Kul Tiras and Zandalar will soon be open to heroes eager to take flight. The achievement Battle for Azeroth Pathfinder, Part Two will allow daring adventurers to take to the skies in Battle for Azeroth&#x2019;s zones, including in the new ones, Mechagon and Nazjatar. Hardy adventurers will need to earn Revered reputation with the Rustbolt Resistance and with their new Nazjatar allies (The Waveblade Ankoan or The Unshackled), explore Mechagon and Nazjatar, and complete the first part of the meta-achievement, Battle for Azeroth Pathfinder, Part One.<br>
<br>
Adventurers who complete these requirements and unlock flying will also be rewarded with a mechanical parrot mount: Wonderwing 2.0.<br>
<br>
Mounts<br>
<br>
Ride through Nazjatar and Mechagon in style as you collect several new aquatic- and mechanical-inspired mounts. Six of them are listed below, but there are even more waiting to be discovered!<br>
<br>
<br>
Azshari Bloatray<br>
<br>
Raised in captivity, these yellow aquatic creatures&#x2019; gas organs are harvested by the naga to allow them to breathe air more easily. Players will rescue one to use as their personal mount after earning the achievement Glory of the Palace Raider. <br>
<br>
Crimson Tidestallion<br>
<br>
These blood-red, spirited creatures gracefully flit through the water, carrying heroes swiftly through the sea. Crimson Tidestallions can be purchased from Murloc Trader Mrrl in Nazjatar in exchange for several eclectic items after completing the quest &#x201C;A Safer Place.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Royal Snapdragon<br>

Fierce and loyal companions, blue Royal Snapdragons are snatched from the wild at a young age and raised to serve naga hunters. Claim your own by vanquishing high-ranking naga in Nazjatar.<br>
<br>
X-995 Mechanocat<br>
<br>
Crafted through Junkyard Tinkering, these robotic cats can be painted a variety of colors, which players can collect during their adventures in Mechagon.<br>
<br>
Scrapforged Mechaspider<br>
<br>
Planet-conscious players who complete the quests given by Recycler Kerchunk in Rustbolt will be rewarded with this mount.<br>
<br>
Mechacycle Model W<br>
<br>
This mechanical marvel is the pinnacle of supercharged street performance in mechagnome travel. Boasting the best in aerodynamic performance, this gorgeous wheel will be gifted to players who complete the achievement Mecha-Done.<br>
<br>
Pet Battles<br>
<br>
A new challenge awaits your army of fierce little companions in Rise of Azshara.<br>
<br>
<br>
Pet Battle Dungeon: Stratholme<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s time to marshal your menagerie and put your best battle pets forward within the halls of Stratholme, a new Pet Battle Dungeon with Normal and Challenge difficulties. Those who prove themselves to be the very best will earn an Ultimate Battle-Training Stone after defeating the dungeon on Normal difficulty. Completing it on Challenge difficulty will grant the achievement Pet Battle Challenge: Stratholme along with the Minimancer pet. To get started on your journey, you&#x2019;ll need to have earned the achievement All Growns Up! (have one level-25 pet) for Normal difficulty or Pro Pet Group (have 15 level-25 pets) for Challenge difficulty. Seek out Tizzy Gearjolt in Boralus or Radek Fuselock in Dazar&#x2019;alor to get started.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Frost<br>
<br>
<br>
Runic Empowerment (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/81229-runic-empowerment) has a 2% chance to proc per Runic Power spent (was 1.5%).<br>
Icecap (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/207126-icecap) now reduces Pillar of Frost cooldown by 2 seconds (was 1 second).<br>
Frost Fever&#x2019;s (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/55095-frost-fever)chance to generate Runic Power increased to 30%.<br>
<br>
Chance now diminishes on targets beyond the first.<br>
<br>
<br>
Frost Strike (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/49143-frost-strike) damage increased by 15%.<br>
Breath of Sindragosa (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/152279-breath-of-sindragosa) damage reduced by 10%.<br>
Breath of Sindragosa (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/152279-breath-of-sindragosa) now generates 2 Runes when cast, and another 2 when the effect expires.<br>
Breath of Sindragosa (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/152279-breath-of-sindragosa) costs 16 Runic Power per second (up from 15).<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: Frost was starved of resources too often, especially when using Breath of Sindragosa. This increases Frosts&#x2019; Rune income baseline and includes a further change that returns many extra Runes while using Breath of Sindragosa. Breath builds will now be able to fill more global cooldowns with casts of Obliterate to make up for the lost Frost Strikes. The cost of Breath itself is increased to keep its overall duration roughly unchanged.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Unholy<br>
<br>
Festering Strike (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/85948-festering-strike), Scourge Strike (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/55090-scourge-strike), Festering Wound (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/197147-festering-wound), Death Coil (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/47541-death-coil), and Clawing Shadows (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/207311-clawing-shadows) damage increased by 15%.<br>
Army of the Dead&#x2019;s (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/42650-army-of-the-dead) Ghoul damage increased by 6%.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: Previously, a bug allowed Army of the Dead Ghouls&#x2019; Energy to benefit doubly from Haste. To compensate for the effects of the bug fix, we&#x2019;ve increased their damage to keep it consistent.<br>

<br>
Havoc<br>
<br>
Mastery: Demonic Presence (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/185164-mastery-demonic-presence) damage bonus increased by 20%.<br>
Chaos Strike (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/162794-chaos-strike) and Trial of Ruin (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/258881-trail-of-ruin) damage reduced by 4%.<br>
<br>
Developer&#x2019;s notes: Previously Mastery was relatively weak when compared to other secondary stats. By increasing Mastery&#x2019;s effect for Havoc, it should now be a more desirable stat on gear. To balance this upcoming power increase, we&#x2019;ve slightly reduced the damage output of Chaos Strike and Trial of Ruin.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Vengeance<br>
<br>
Demonic Wards (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/203513-demonic-wards) damage reduction increased to 15% (was 10%).<br>
Demonic Wards (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/203513-demonic-wards) armor bonus increased to 100% (was 80%).<br>
Demon Spikes (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/203720-demon-spikes) armor reduced to 60% of Agility (was 85%).<br>
Soul Cleave (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/228477-soul-cleave) damage increased by 40%.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: More so than other tanks, Vengeance Demon Hunters are currently dealing with the problem of low mitigation when their active mitigation is down. These changes provide a substantial increase to physical mitigation when Demon Spikes is down, and a neutral-to-very-slight increase when Demon Spikes is active. The changes also provide some overall passive reduction to magic damage. Overall, the amount of sustained damage Vengeance takes will be lower, and the periods of vulnerability outside of Demon Spikes should be less dramatic.<br>
<br>
<br>
Metamorphosis (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/187827-metamorphosis)<br>
<br>
Health bonus is now 50% (was 30%).<br>
Shear (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/203782-shear) now generates 20 additional Pain and 1 additional Lesser Soul Fragment (was: generates 7 Pain per second).<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: This significantly increases the health bonus, damage mitigation, and self-healing potential of Metamorphosis, as well as the health buffer, making it a more reliable major cooldown against all types of damage.<br>

<br>
Soothe (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/2908-soothe), Remove Corruption (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/2782-remove-corruption), Moonfire (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/164812-moonfire), and Rebirth (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20484-rebirth) are no longer castable in Cat or Bear form by default.<br>
Feral Druids now have a passive ability learned at level 22 that allows Remove Corruption (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/2782-remove-corruption) and Soothe (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/2908-soothe) to be cast in Cat Form.<br>
Guardian Druids now have a passive ability learned at level 10 that allows Soothe (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/2908-soothe), Remove Corruption (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/2782-remove-corruption), Moonfire (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/164812-moonfire), and Rebirth (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20484-rebirth) to be cast in Bear Form.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: Guardian Druid is limited in its practical ability to use some utility abilities while tanking, and we&#x2019;re loosening that restriction by allowing Remove Corruption in Bear Form. We&#x2019;re also cleaning up Druid shapeshifting rules slightly: the use of magical-themed spells in beast forms is allowed by passive upgrades given to Guardian and Feral specializations specifically. This represents their special mastery of their &#x201C;home&#x201D; form that allows for limited spellcasting, and from a gameplay perspective, this allows Feral and Guardian Druids to use spells in-form when there is a strong practical need. At the same time, in situations where there is no fantasy justification or gameplay need, it makes sense for spellcasting to be more restricted. For example, non&#x2013;Guardian Druids can no longer cast Moonfire in Bear Form.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guardian<br>
<br>
Ironfur (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/192081-ironfur) now has a maximum of 8 stacks.<br>
Ironfur (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/192081-ironfur) and Maul (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/6807-maul) now cost 40 Rage (was 45).<br>
Mangle (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/33917-mangle) now generates 10 Rage (was 8).<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: Ironfur is intended to be maintainable with high uptime (up to 100%) and have some overlaps on top of that. Currently, depending on talent configuration, Druids may only be able to barely maintain full uptime on Ironfur. Making Ironfur much more available should allow better control over timing and overlaps, as well as improving Guardian mitigation overall.<br>
<br>
<br>
Shifting to Bear Form now gives 25 Rage (was 20).<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: It should now be much easier to get the first Ironfur activated promptly after engaging an enemy, due to the increased starting Rage and lower cost.<br>
<br>
<br>

Vampiric Touch (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/34914-vampiric-touch) damage reduced by 9%.<br>
<br>
We believe damage-over-time specializations that maintain a variety of DoT spells should in general output more damage in encounters with multiple targets than single-target oriented specializations. In addition to measuring class specializations against others, we must also balance them across the entire spectrum of content. Due to the types of encounters in Tides of Vengeance, Shadow Priests were especially strong in some contexts and correspondingly weak in very few situations when compared to similar DoT specializations. As such, we&#x2019;re slightly pulling back on the abilities that proc Shadowy Apparition, which is the prominent contributor of making Shadow Priests significantly stronger than similar counterparts.<br>

Keep Your Wits About You (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/288979-keep-your-wits-about-you)(Azerite Trait) now stacks once per instance of Blade Flurry (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/13877-blade-flurry) dealing damage (was once for every target Blade Flurry hits). Each stack now provides 5% Sinister Strike (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/193315-sinister-strike) chance (was 2%).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: In very large packs of enemies, especially in dungeons, Keep Your Wits About You provides much more damage than one copy of one Azerite Trait was intended to provide. With this change, you&#x2019;ll still feel this trait accelerate as you build stacks, but the size of the group that you&#x2019;re fighting won&#x2019;t affect how much damage the trait is giving you. This will be a damage increase against two targets, and a damage reduction against 3 or more targets.<br>

The Molten Weapon (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/224125-molten-weapon) buff from the Elemental Spirits (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/262624-elemental-spirits) talent now only modifies the Fire damage of your class abilities, instead of modifying all Fire damage dealt.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: With the addition of the new Azerite Essences in the Rise of Azshara content update, many of which deal Fire damage, we did not want to make this talent feel mandatory. Prior to this change, the Molten Weapon buff from the fiery Spirit Wolf would have increased the damage dealt by several Azerite Essences. The buff effects from Elemental Spirits talent are intended to increase your class abilities, and still will after this change. <br>

Most item effects that deal damage or healing now scale based off of a character&#x2019;s secondary stat (was primary stat).<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; note: We made some under-the-hood changes to how item effects that deal damage, healing, and shielding scale with item level. The net effect of these changes is that almost all items like this in Battle for Azeroth are now moderately stronger. The difference is greater the higher the item level of the item. This includes items from Battle for Azeroth dungeons, raids, and PvP rewards. <br>

Enlistment Bonus<br>
<br>
Now rewards 50% more Azerite Power for participating in Random Battlegrounds and Epic Battlegrounds.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; note: Battleground queue times become exceedingly long when one faction has more people queuing than the other. When queue times exceed a certain threshold, Mercenary Mode becomes available for the faction with long queue times and the Enlistment Bonus becomes available for the less represented faction. Now, the Enlistment Bonus will increase the amount of Azerite Power from Random Battlegrounds and Random Epic Battlegrounds by 50%.<br>

Trident of the Deep Ocean (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/167864-trident-of-deep-ocean) absorption shield is now reduced by 75% in PvP (was 50%).<br>
Mindthief&#x2019;s Eldritch Clasp (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/167840-mindthiefs-eldritch-clasp) healing and self-damage effect is now reduced by 50% in PvP.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; note: Several Crucible of Storms raid items had a significant impact on the PvP meta in Season 2. We believe that raid items in PvP can be a meaningful source of gameplay variety that contribute to each season feeling a bit different than ones before it. Due to the nature of our PvP scaling system, which helps make PvP more accessible for more players, means the effects of these items will remain relevant longer than we&#x2019;d like. Therefore, we&#x2019;re reducing the effectiveness of these items in the new patch so players can feel good about transitioning to new items they acquire in Season 3.<br>

Horde and Alliance Glider Kits now have a prideful new look.<br>

Chill Streak (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/204167-chill-streak) can now critical strike, scale with your increased damage modifications (e.g. Mastery), and benefit from damage taken debuffs applied on the target.<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; note: We&#x2019;re changing Chill Streak from damage based on the target&#x2019;s maximum health to one based on the Death Knight&#x2019;s attack power. This has the effect of dealing damage more equally against targets of any health range.<br>

<br>
Developers&apos; notes: In Season 2, we increased the importance of healer mana management in Arenas and Battlegrounds by reducing mana regeneration in PvP instances. Due to Discipline&#x2019;s healing style, the spec tends to run out of mana much faster in Arena compared to other specs. So, we&#x2019;re buffing their mana regeneration in PvP and adjusting some of their PvP talents to increase their throughput. In addition, we&#x2019;re adjusting Dome of Light to allow it to be used more frequently but with less damage reduction to give them an additional tool to recover after crowd control.<br>

Affliction<br>

Dispelling Endless Affliction (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/213400-endless-affliction) will silence, damage, and increase damage taken by 10% to the target while active.<br>
Casting Unstable Affliction (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/231791-unstable-affliction) on a target that has Endless Affliction (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/213400-endless-affliction) active will remove it.<br>

<br>
Developers&#x2019; note: Our intention with the Endless Affliction talent is to allow the Warlock to opt into longer dispel protection for their team&#x2019;s damage over time spells and other debuffs. The previous version of this came at a cost of slowing down the rate at which they deal damage. We&#x2019;ve broken the additional dispel protection off into its own debuff so that this talent doesn&#x2019;t change the warlocks damage profile.<br>
