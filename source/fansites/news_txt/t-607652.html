<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2008-05-12, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Update (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter) - It looks like Scare Beast still takes 1.5 sec and isn&apos;t instant as mentionned in the patch files notes. The notes on the official site have been updated to reflect it changes and we can assume that the 1.5 sec casting time is intended. <br>
<br>
Update 05/13 - The patch is now confirmed on European Realms - This Wednesday there will be an extended maintenance to apply patch 2.4.2. Please note that all European realms will be offline from 03:00 until 11:00, Paris time (CEST).<br>
<br>
Update - The next Blizzcon has been announced, it will be held in Anaheim, California on October 10 and 11, see the Press Release (http://www.blizzard.co.uk/press/080512.shtml)<br>
<br>
-------------------------------<br>
<br>
As I write this post, nothing is confirmed by Blizzard yet. However, final patch files have been made available and there isn&apos;t any reason for Blizzard to postpone it one more week. We can assume that patch 2.4.2 will be deployed this week on live servers and we&apos;ll probably get a confirmation very soon.<br>

Patch mirrors<br>
The patch isn&apos;t big and I suggest that you wait for the official download instead of using alternative download links, but if you really can&apos;t use the Blizzard Downloader the patches are mirrored below.<br>
<br>
Do not install this patch until the server downtime, otherwise you won&apos;t be able to connect until Tuesday/Wednesday on live servers<br>

Undocumented changes<br>
Most of the undocumented changes reported on PTRs are now part of the official patch notes<br>
<br>
Item additions<br>
A new PvP Trinket as been added to Honor Rewards Medallion of the Alliance (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/epicpvptrinket.jpg). There is obviously a horde version of the item and both of them cost 40 000 Honor Points. We don&apos;t know yet if it will be added at the beginning of 2.4.2, or if we&apos;ll have to wait for the beginning of Season 4 to be able to buy them. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Item Changes<br>
Naturalist&apos;s Preserving Cinch (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/naturalistcinch.jpg) and Borderland Fortress Grips (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/borderlandgrips.jpg) have been upgraded.<br>
[item=19169] now has a chance to fail for targets above level 60<br>
[item=19955] now grants 70 (instead of 400) spell haste rating, and reduces the mana cost of Rejuvenation, Healing Touch, Regrowth, and Tranquility by -5% for 15 seconds. (Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/zgtrinkets.jpg))<br>
[item=19958] now grants 70 (instead of 400) spell haste rating and reduces the mana cost of your healing spells by -5% for 15 seconds. (Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/zgtrinkets.jpg))<br>
[item=19954] energy bonus is now reduced by 4 points by level after level 60, lowering the energy bonus to 20 at level 70 instead of 40. (Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/zgtrinkets.jpg))<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Quests changes<br>
The Quest &quot;The Multiphase Survey (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/multispectral.jpg)&quot;, where you retrieve surveys from Nagrand, no longer gives a [item=35232].<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Professions changes<br>
Jewelcrafting<br>
A new recipe has been added - Purified Shadowsong Amethyst (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/purifiedshadowsong2.jpg) (Reward from the Shattered Sun Offensive, Exalted reputation required)<br>
<br>
Leatherworking<br>
[item=34207] now requires 4x[item=23793] and 3x[item=22452] (instead of 18 Leathers and 14 Primal)<br>
<br>
Blacksmithing<br>
Blacksmiths are probably going to be happy, all their BOP Weapons have been changed and aren&apos;t unique anymore ! That&apos;s a nice change alone, but if you took the time to read the 2.4.2 Patch Notes you probably remember seeing something mentioning Main Hand weapons changed to One-Hand .... Well that&apos;s the case here, you can now dual-wield them (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/bopblacksmith.jpg) !<br>
<br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/bopblacksmith_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/bopblacksmith.jpg)<br>
<br>
New Mounts<br>
According to spells and models available in the game files, at least two new mounts have been added but none of them have been discovered on PTRs. We might see them much later on live servers ... or never. <br>
<br>
Swift Zebra<br>
49322 : Swift Zebra - Summons and dismisses a rideable Swift Zebra. This is a very fast mount.<br>
<br>
Headless Horseman&apos;s Mount<br>
48023 : Headless Horseman&apos;s Mount - Summons and dismisses a rideable Headless Horseman&apos;s Mount.<br>
48024 : Headless Horseman&apos;s Mount, Ground - Summons and dismisses a rideable Headless Horseman&apos;s Mount.<br>
48025 : Use Headless Horseman&apos;s Reins<br>
<br>
The headless horseman mount &quot;,Ground&quot; effect could be the sign of a flying mount, but obviously nothing is confirmed yet. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Mount enchantments<br>
Some changes have been made to replace trinkets boosting your mount&apos;s speed by &quot;mount enchantments&quot;, however we didn&apos;t see anything like that on PTRs and it will probably be added later in the game. You can still find some information about them in the PTR 2.4.2 Undocumented changes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=6699.0) post.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Arena Season 4<br>
The Season 4 starting date isn&apos;t known yet, however all the season 4 items were activated on PTRs during the 2.4.2 testing phase, we can assume it won&apos;t be too long before we see it on live servers after the deployment of the patch.<br>

<br>
Rating requirements<br>
While Season 3 is still going strong, we wanted to announce ahead of time the rating requirements that will be present for arena items once Season 4 begins. We also wanted to give everyone a heads up to some changes that will be in an upcoming patch, altering how points are gained and players are matched in the arena system. The patch with these changes is scheduled to release before the start of Season 4.<br>
<br>
First though, the rating requirement changes:<br>
<br>
When Season 4 begins, Season 3 items will be reduced in personal and team arena rating requirement to:<br>
Shoulders: 1950<br>
Weapon: 1800<br>
<br>
The new Season 4 items will have the below personal and team arena rating requirements:<br>
Shoulders: 2200<br>
Weapon: 2050<br>
Head: 1700<br>
Chest: 1600<br>
Legs: 1550<br>
Gloves: none<br>
Off-hand: none<br>
<br>
In addition, some of the Season 4 quality items that will be purchasable with honor will also carry a personal and team arena rating requirement:<br>
Boots: 1700<br>
Ring: 1650<br>
Bracers: 1575<br>
Belt: none<br>
Necklace: none<br>
Trinket: none<br>
<br>
The Season 2 items, which will move to the honor system when Season 4 begins, will continue to have no rating requirement.<br>
<br>
The changes to the rating requirements for these items reflect the nature of the items, their power, and the relative difficulty that should be had when attempting to obtain them. These items are comparable to those found in the newest 25 person raid zone, Sunwell Plateau, and should therefore also feel very challenging to obtain.<br>
<br>
To help ensure that the challenge in obtaining these items stays true to those achieving these ratings, we&apos;ll also be implementing new rules with an upcoming patch to curb practices that undermine the core concepts of the arena system. These rules are as follows:<br>
If a character&#x2019;s personal rating is more than 150 points below the team rating, they will earn points based on their personal rating instead of the team rating.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This means that a player cannot join a highly rated team and begin earning points based purely on the pre-established rating of the team before they joined it. They&apos;ll need to compete, improve, and gain a personal rating worthy of the points they would receive.<br>
If the average personal rating of the players queuing for a game is more than 150 points below the team&#x2019;s rating, the team will be queued against an opponent matching or similar to the average personal rating.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This means that players cannot join a highly rated team and immediately face highly rated opponents, easily and quickly bringing their personal rating up. Instead they&apos;ll need to again compete, improve, and earn their rating.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re excited to see these changes implemented, which will continue to emphasize the strong competitive nature of the arenas, and the challenge in obtaining the highest end rewards available for PvP. <br>

<br>

NEW YORK (May 12, 2008) &#x2013; Major League Gaming (MLG), the professional videogame league, today announced the launch of the MLG PC Circuit played on HP Blackbird 002. The kick-off event will be held alongside MLG&#x2019;s Pro Circuit event in San Diego June 13-15 and will feature Blizzard Entertainment&#xAE;&#x2019;s World of Warcraft&#xAE;: The Burning Crusade&#xAE; and over $20,000 in prizes. <br>
<br>
&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve just come off our Meadowlands season opener, which attracted a record-setting 12,000 players and fans. Working with industry leaders HP and Blizzard Entertainment will allow us to reach more of America&#x2019;s 40 million competitive gamers,&#x201D; said Matthew Bromberg, CEO of Major League Gaming. <br>
<br>
The 2008 MLG PC Pro Circuit competitions will be played entirely on HP Blackbird 002 gaming PC&#x2019;s. Created with gamers in mind, the award-winning HP Blackbird 002 Gaming PC is highly configurable and features liquid cooling and innovative thermal chambers to keep critical components cool while running next-generation games or other demanding computing tasks. <br>
