World of Warcraft Reaches 12 Million Players!<br>
&quot;Rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.&quot;<br>
IRVINE, Calif. -- October 7, 2010 Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. announced today that the subscriber base for World of Warcraft&#xAE;, its award-winning massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), now exceeds 12 million players worldwide. This milestone was reached in the wake of the mainland Chinese launch of World of Warcraft&apos;s second expansion, Wrath of the Lich King&#xAE;, and also as global anticipation continues to mount for the December 7 release of the game&apos;s third expansion, Cataclysm&#x2122;.<br>
<br>
&quot;The support and enthusiasm that gamers across the world continue to show for World of Warcraft reaffirms our belief that it offers one of the best entertainment values available today,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;We are as committed as ever to taking the game to new heights, and we look forward to demonstrating that with Cataclysm in December.&quot;<br>
<br>
Since debuting in North America, Australia, and New Zealand on November 23, 2004, World of Warcraft has become the most popular subscription-based MMORPG around the world. It was the bestselling PC game of 2005 and 2006 worldwide, and finished behind only World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade&#xAE;, the first expansion pack for the game, in 2007. For 2008, the World of Warcraft series represented three of the top five bestselling PC games, with Wrath of the Lich King finishing the year at #1, and in 2009, World of Warcraft titles claimed three of the top six spots.*<br>
<br>
World of Warcraft is currently available in eight languages and is played in North America, Europe, mainland China, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Chile, Argentina, and the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.<br>
<br>
To keep pace with the continued growth of World of Warcraft as well as development on other Blizzard Entertainment games, the company is currently hiring for numerous open positions. More information on career opportunities available at Blizzard Entertainment can be found at www.blizzard.com/jobs.<br>

Battle.net Authenticator Change<br>
To help keep Battle.net accounts as secure as possible, we&#x2019;ve recently changed how Battle.net authenticators can be used. Going forward, Battle.net authenticators can now only be associated with one Battle.net account at a time. No changes are being made to how many game licenses a single Battle.net account can support. You can still have multiple World of Warcraft accounts under a single Battle.net account, for instance, and all game licenses linked with a Battle.net account will still be protected if an authenticator is in use.<br>
<br>
Those of you who currently have more than one Battle.net account associated with a single authenticator will be able to maintain your existing setup without needing to do anything. This change will only affect new authenticator attachments. But, if at some point you decide to detach the authenticator from any of your Battle.net accounts for any reason, you won&apos;t be able to reattach it if it&apos;s already associated with another Battle.net account.<br>
<br>
For more information on the Battle.net authenticator and mobile authenticator application (available for free with many mobile carriers), please visit http://us.blizzard.com/support/article/blizzardauth<br>
<br>
Cataclysm actually adds a couple of security features linked to the authenticator, you can now restrict guild ranks to people using Authenticators. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
AUTHENTICATOR_CONFIRM_GUILD_DEMOTE = &quot;%1$s can&apos;t be demoted to %2$s because that rank requires an Authenticator. Do you wish to demote %1$s to %3$s?&quot;;<br>
AUTHENTICATOR_CONFIRM_GUILD_PROMOTE = &quot;%1$s can&apos;t be promoted to %2$s because that rank requires an Authenticator. Do you wish to promote %1$s to %3$s?&quot;;<br>
AUTHENTICATOR_GUILD_RANK_CHANGE = &quot;This action would make the lowest guild rank require an Authenticator.&quot;;<br>
AUTHENTICATOR_GUILD_RANK_IN_USE = &quot;You can&apos;t set this option on a guild rank in use.&quot;;<br>
AUTHENTICATOR_GUILD_RANK_LAST = &quot;You can&apos;t set this option on the lowest guild rank.&quot;;<br>

<br>
<br>
There was also another weird authentication added to the game files a while back, it might be for internal use only and I decided it would be safer to hide the phone number just to make sure that I don&apos;t make Blizzard very sad. <br>

PHONESECURE_ENH_TEXT = &quot;For security reasons, please call +x-xxx-xxx-xxx from the phone registered on this account to validate this login attempt, and enter your PIN as well as the following security code: %d.&quot;;<br>
PHONESECURE_HEADER = &quot;Phone Call Required&quot;;<br>
