Legion - Tyrande, Malfurion, and Elothir<br>
We found some interesting references to Tyrande, Malfurion, and Elothir. Unfortunately there isn&apos;t much more than what is below yet. Keep in mind that this is just a reference in an alpha build of Legion, not something final or officially announced. Spoilers below!<br>
<br>
The vision is chaotic, unfocused. I need to concentrate.<br>
I will need to focus on the vision to understand its message. Guard me while I do this, $n.<br>
Yes, Tyrande.<br>
Do not let anything disturb my meditation. I must see through the chaos.<br>
I see... swirling red mist. Gnashing teeth.<br>
That is Malfurion&apos;s voice! He is livid and... in terrible agony.<br>
Such malevolent laughter... who could be so cruel?<br>
I only pray that we are not too late.<br>
The corruption is getting worse. There is something across the bridge... Is that the Archdruid Elothir?<br>
By Elune... what happened, Elothir? Have you seen my husband?<br>
The Nightmare... claims me. Malfurion calls out in the darkness. I cannot see him...<br>
You must help me find him! Is there anything I can do?<br>
You may not, but perhaps... your mother moon can.<br>
I will petition Elune. The Nightmare taint cannot be removed.... but perhaps we can hold it back.<br>
Long enough... to seek him out... *Elothir groans* The trees whisper nonsense. I can almost understand...<br>
Hold yourself on the edge of madness, Elothir! Mother moon will hold you as long as she can.<br>
He approaches the heart of corruption! Quickly, Tyrande, to Shala&apos;nir! There is no time!<br>
I will go to him! Elothir?<br>
The madness... claims me...<br>
Elothir&apos;s form is unresponsive. The Nightmare has taken hold.<br>
Elothir&apos;s inert form stares blankly into the distance.<br>
Elothir appears completely unaware of his surroundings.<br>
There is no time to lose. Elothir is beyond our reach now. Come with me.<br>
Shala&apos;nir is just ahead. When we arrive, you will search the buildings to the left. I will search those to the right. Shout if you find him.<br>
I am coming Malfurion!<br>
I hear a struggle by the gazebo! Malfurion?! Answer me!<br>
Hah! Claim him if you can, Night Elf!<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
Besides, how many people actually have &quot;the Insane&quot; in WoW? Pretty small percent, and that&apos;s pure dedication.<br>
That one is, but I&apos;d argue the prestige is pretty small. Now imagine it granted a legendary.... (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685657650869088256))<br>
<br>
Well, he also conceded that maybe it&apos;s not feasible.<br>
Yeah. I think there is an expectation that only a few people can wield say Excalibur, but maybe not in an MMO (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685657938963218432))<br>
