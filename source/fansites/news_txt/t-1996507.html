Legion - Respect Cost Removed<br>
The costs to change specs and talents are changing in the next Legion build:<br>
<br>
<br>
Changing specs in Legion will no longer cost gold! <br>
Changing talents will be free in a city or your Order Hall.<br>
Changing talents out in the field will require a reagent crafted by Inscription with a cost aimed at groups. <br>
Currently, talent changes are free and instant out of combat, which isn&apos;t restrictive enough. <br>
In the current build the system that is going away worked like this:<br>
<br>
You could change from any spec to your primary spec for free, with your primary spec set at a class trainer.<br>
Your first respec was free, with a cooldown of less than 24 hours to reset the cost to free again. <br>
After that, respecs were &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;58&lt;/span&gt;, and capping at &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;78&lt;/span&gt;, with a 24 hour cooldown to drop one cost level each time you changed specs. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We&apos;ve definitely heard much feedback to this effect, and this is something we&apos;d been discussing quite a bit internally as well over the past couple of weeks. In an upcoming build (hopefully the next one; if not, then the one after), the respec cost is gone, and players can freely switch between all specializations with the normal restrictions of cast-time, needing to be out of combat, and so forth.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, the intent behind the respec cost (which isn&apos;t really a new concept, dating back to 2004 class trainers) was to help reinforce a bit of spec identity through declaring a &quot;primary&quot; spec to which you could always return for free, and to serve as a mild gold sink. But in practice, changing specialization is a pretty significant transformation in terms of action bars, optimal gear in some cases, artifacts, and so forth, and already not something that people were taking lightly. I suspect the cost will not be missed.<br>
<br>
An area that has appeared to need a bit more friction, however, is actually talent changes. Especially with no reagent cost at all now, it can be all too easy to activate AoE talents before larger packs of enemies in a dungeon, and then switch back to single-target talents before a lieutenant or a boss. Or someone might switch to a passive movement-speed talent when traversing an area, and then back to something functional before entering combat. At that point, we&apos;re often hardly talking about a meaningful choice at all, but rather a nuisance of extra button-presses or UI navigation before you can use your desired talents.<br>
<br>
And so, alongside removing the respec cost, that same upcoming build will also restrict the ability to change talents when away from a safe area (defined as an area that provides the Rested state). We currently plan to give Scribes a recipe to craft a consumable Tome that can be dropped in order to allow all nearby players to retalent freely for a time - particularly useful for group play.<br>
<br>
A couple of clarifications, one of which will probably be a relief and the other likely less so: The Inscription consumable as currently planned would be something that anyone could drop, not a profession-requiring item like a Jeeves. But, in terms of the materials required, we&apos;re thinking of something that&apos;s more aimed at groups, and probably not the sort of thing an individual is likely to carry a stack of and use freely.<br>
<br>
This is clearly more restrictive than the way it works in Warlords. Why would we ever add restrictions to something like this? Do we just sit around and amuse ourselves by thinking of things to take away from players? (We don&apos;t.)<br>
<br>
Ultimately, for a choice to be meaningful there has to be some associated cost or trade-off in the process. Do you want to eat your cake, or do you want to save it for another time? If you could do both, that wouldn&apos;t be much of a choice. <br>
<br>
When it comes to talents, which serve the primary purpose of customization and differentiation, consider two extremes in terms of how they could be handled. Please, take a moment to think through the following scenarios:<br>
<br>
First, what if you could switch talents freely, at any time, including while in combat? You&apos;d effectively no longer have a talent system - you&apos;d have a spellbook with another 21 active and passive abilities in it, with keybinds to swap between them as needed. Every player of a given spec would have identical capabilities, with some cumbersome interface management required to swap among them on the fly.<br>
<br>
Second, what if you could literally never switch talents, short of making a brand new character? Choosing a talent would be a far, far weightier choice than any decision you currently make in the game (other than choosing your starting class, I suppose). Some favored cookie-cutter specs would emerge, but with 2187 different permutations of talents, there&apos;d be significantly more variety among players. But some niche talents would likely go almost entirely unused (though players who did choose them would be invaluable when those situations arose). And feeling like you&apos;d made a mistake, and were stuck with one or more talents that you didn&apos;t like at all, might completely sour your enjoyment of a character.<br>
<br>
Anyway, we are of course doing neither of those things, but there&apos;s a full spectrum of choice that lies in between. We&apos;ve generally moved away from the second scenario and closer to the first over time (years and years back, respecs were so expensive in relative terms that players often waited for class changes to automatically refund their talents rather than spend the gold to move a point around). Other than the combat restrictions, the live game is not terribly far off from the first scenario. <br>
<br>
There&apos;s still a fair bit of thought that goes into which talents to select for a raid encounter, where you&apos;re in combat for several minutes in a row and facing a variety of threats, and you may have to weigh whether you want better AoE damage for minions in the first phase, or better single-target burst later in the fight; whether you want a passive movement-speed increase for higher overall uptime, or an on-demand active movement ability in case you get targeted by a specific troublesome ability; and so forth. <br>
<br>
But most other content, whether it&apos;s a single quest boss out in the world, or a dungeon that breaks down to a series of sub-1-minute combats, don&apos;t offer nearly that much variety. And so you take the AoE talent for the AoE pack, and the single-target talent for the lone boss, to the point that you might as well just have both of them all the time, which might be powerful, but wouldn&apos;t be a choice.<br>
<br>
I am actually relieved to hear that a scribe is not a necessity. But what I would like to know is if PvP is being kept in mind. For example, I might throw on my PvP gear to do a battleground. Let&apos;s say that takes me 15 minutes. After that, I&apos;m being called to a raid. I need to change out my talents - twice because as we all know, there are certain talents that are better for PvP and certain talents that are better for PvE. I&apos;m not really going to use spring blossoms in PvP due to movement but I might in PvE depending on the encounter. <br>
In this case, if you&apos;re returning to any safe area (your Class Order Hall, Dalaran, Stormwind, or whatever) in between activities, you could change talents freely with no cooldown, cost, or other restriction. The Inscription consumable would only come into play if you wanted to change talent out on the fly, in the field.<br>

Character Skin Color Options<br>
I&apos;ve had plenty of friends who would like a more diverse style of skin choices for many races, humans included. I don&apos;t see this as far-fetched feedback by any means. <br>
<br>
One of the earliest ideas in RPGs was to create a character modeled after yourself in a fantasy world, where you can go on these spectacular adventures that aren&apos;t possible in the real world - the current choices can be limiting in this sense in various situations. Many people who are asking for these additions, among others, simply want a more customizable experience, and there is no harm in that.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I&apos;ve passed this feedback along to the Development team. Let&apos;s keep the conversation civil and we will keep this thread open for more feedback and discussion!

Legion Beta Server Issues<br>
Dalaran Underbelly Disabled<br>
In order to address issues with Dalaran NPCs suddenly disappearing, we&apos;ve decided to disable the Underbelly subzone for the time being. Players with characters saved in that zone will be ported out upon initial login. We&apos;re currently investigating permanent solutions to dissapearing NPCs and should have the issue resolved in an upcoming patch.<br>
<br>
Due to this change, Subtlety Rogue artifact acquisition questlines will be roadblocked for now. If you experience any other roadblocked questlines with this change, please let us know in your comments below. <br>
<br>
Thanks for your patience everyone! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/412062-dalaran-underbelly-disabled/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743526335?page=1#1))<br>

World Server Down<br>
We are working on fixing this right now. Server team is doing battle with an issue impacting Dalaran which is causing it to crash, reboot, crash. Hoping to fix it soon&#x2122;<br>
<br>
Our success in fixing some of the underlying phasing issues seems to uncovered this bug that was previously hidden. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/412092-world-server-down/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743934189?page=1#17))<br>
<br>
Server Lag<br>
Yes, we are attempting to slay these lag inducing bugs now as well.<br>
<br>
Had a quick question if you don&apos;t mind Yad, after I finished my Helheim quests on my DH and we got beamed up I dc&apos;ed and cant log back in at all just to that one char. I managed to log in once and my screen is white and it says I&apos;m stunned cant do anything and it dc&apos;ed again. Was wondering if that&apos;s happening to everyone or any chance I can get a teleport for my char Laeroth. Thank you!<br>
Happening to many right now. Something else we are working on... It has been a busy day, hehe. <br>
<br>
TLDR there are many issues affecting servers which are being fixed right now in parallel. As a result we are frequently restarting servers to pickup changes. Some of these changes are leading to new or previously unknown issues that we then have to fix. Currently playing whack-a-bug. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/412074-is-the-server-laggy-or-is-it-me/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743854181?page=1#6))<br>
<br>
Phasing Issues<br>
We&apos;ve had team members looking at the underlying causes of the phasing issues over the weekend and today. The good news is that as we&apos;ve been digging in to find the root of the problem we&apos;ve fixed dozens of issues in the system. While we&apos;re not confident that we&apos;ve fixed the root cause once and for all yet we&apos;ve seen this issue improving throughout the day on the Beta realms from some of the changes we&apos;ve been making.<br>
<br>
We are still on this and it is a very high priority for us and this experience with the launch of Beta has been extremely valuable to us not only for exposing this issue but also the myriad of other load driven problems that have been uncovered thanks to the high volume of players.<br>
<br>
We hope to have this resolved soon so people can get back to testing out the content itself rather than being gated by disconnects and phase issues. We&apos;ve been actively applying fixes for both to the server and clients throughout the day.
