Warlords of Draenor - Vicious War Raptor<br>
Today we are taking a look at the Vicious War Raptor (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116778-vicious-war-raptor). This is the new Horde PvP mount in Patch 6.0.2, sold by Deathguard Netharian (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/73151-deathguard-netharian) for Vicious Saddle (http://www.wowdb.com/items/103533-vicious-saddle). If you don&apos;t already have a saddle, you can get one from the Primal Combatant (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9236-primal-combatant) achievement when Warlords of Draenor launches.<br>

New Character Model Changes<br>
Are the new models done?<br>
Sorry about that, it&apos;s not intentional. We&apos;re still looking through and collecting feedback, and of course still have the Blood Elf update to go. We don&apos;t really consider anything in the game as &quot;done&quot;, it&apos;s a constantly moving and changing and evolving game. In addition to going through stylistic feedback, there are a number of items that are simply bugs we&apos;ll be addressing, like facial feature options clearly not matching up (most obvious being Undead eyes appearing where no eyes existed before).<br>
<br>
If you have any threads/images/videos you think encapsulate your feedback particularly well, feel free to share them. Can never have too many links.<br>
<br>

Blue Posts<br>
Arthas Costume ChargesThe charges on the item appearing as 1 (instead of 50) while on the vendor is due to a separate bug we&apos;re tracking. Many items throughout the game may be currently showing 1 charge, but when purchased will display their correct amount of charges remaining. It&apos;s a bug we&apos;re working to address but won&apos;t be within the Lich King costume fixes.

Any reason Ele has 0 mana regen whatsoever? Are they just intended to be horrible in WoD because there is really no reason.<br>
Their damage spells have almost no cost. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522839978972176384))<br>
<br>
PvE<br>
If I skip Tectus/Brackenspore and kill Mar&apos;gok, can I go back and kill them, or will the raid &quot;complete&quot; with Mar&apos;gok&apos;s death?<br>
You can go back and kill them. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522761494120120322))<br>
<br>
According to patch note, each diff. should have its own lockout. But 10m &amp; 25m Legacy raids are sharing them. Is this intended?<br>
That&apos;s for Siege of Orgrimmar and Draenor raids. All other raids unaffected. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522846853671305216))<br>
<br>
Releasing in Siege or UBRS dodges a load screen. Will the old raids/instances see that too?<br>
Draenor dungeons/raids will all work that way as well. We&apos;ll likely retrofit it to older instances in the future. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522853610825064449))<br>
<br>
PvP<br>
So honor not dropping from the rares and honor not coming from the isle of thunder quests intended or bug?<br>
Intended. Those NPCs/quests served their purpose during Mists. The time has come to remove them. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522531702002831362))<br>
<br>
18 honor per win your joking right increase honor win cos 18 honor per win i wont even get full s15 on my hunter sort it!<br>
Battlegrounds in Mists rewarded approximately 20 honor/minute for the winner. 18 for a fast skirmish win isn&apos;t far off. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522532392632741888))<br>
At level 100, you&apos;ll be getting that honor AND a box that might have a piece of gear you need. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522532530973470720))<br>
<br>
The new group finder is pretty awful for PvP... At least add 2v2, 3v3, 5v5, RBG categories?<br>
When the season starts there will be arena and RBG categories. Pretty pointless to have them out of season. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522585831748300800))<br>
