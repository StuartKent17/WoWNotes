Patch 5.3 - Brawler&apos;s Guild Changes<br>
Patch 5.3 adds several new bosses to the Brawler&apos;s Guild, as well as some other things:<br>
<br>
<br>
Card Trader Ami will sell you cards (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Challenge+Card) that allow you to fight bosses from ranks you have already defeated.<br>
Defeating some of the new bosses will give you access to some of the new Brawler&apos;s Guild shirts (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3216-Brawler-s-Guild-Shirts-World-First-Level-90-April-18-Hotfixes-Blue-Posts-Fan-Art). Defeating all of them will give you the http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/98543.jpg Wraps of the Blood-Soaked Brawler (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/98543-wraps-of-the-blood-soaked-brawler).<br>
A new VIP lounge has been added on the zeppelin circling the arena for Rank 8 players. The Alliance also have a VIP lounge in the balcony.<br>
Reaching Rank 9 will give you another invite to the brawler&apos;s guild.<br>
Reaching Rank 10 rewards access to purchase the http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/98405.jpg Brawler&apos;s Burly Mushan Beast (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/98405-brawlers-burly-mushan-beast).<br>
Spectator totems and consoles have been added to give you a better view of the fight.<br>
The Alliance fight pit floor has been raised to make it easier to view the fight.<br>

The boss in the video preview image above is Hexos. You must constantly turn so that he does not hit any of the incoming rectangles, while doing ~100K DPS.<br>

Talking a lot about class cooldowns. We could lower CDs or lower magnitude and buff sustained. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330757618790453248))<br>
This could have both PvE and PvP benefits. The CD effects would be harder to notice though. Thoughts? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330757848223080449))<br>
Imagine Recklessness as a 10% crit buff or a nerfed GoaK on a 2-3 min timer along with sustained DPS buff. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330758033036693504))<br>
<br>
Curious: what do you feel is the best crit %, from a &quot;fun to play&quot; perspective? Assume dps is normalized.<br>
Assuming nothing procs from crit? I&apos;d say something like 15-20%. If you&apos;re depending on procs etc. then much higher. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331871953856126976))<br>
<br>
Do you feel hunters need the most work out of all the pures for spec differences and dmg output as of now for 6.0?<br>
We think rogues and hunters need more spec differentiation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332638999447486464))<br>
<br>
Do you feel warlocks are generally behind most other pure dps classes in terms of damage and cc (especially mages, rogues)?<br>
Warlocks? No. Hunters are the only pure that feel a little low, and we are buffing them slightly in 5.3. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332548750444744704))<br>
<br>
Hey GC. How do you feel about DoT snapshotting being an important part of some specs DPS? Seems opaque and complex imo.<br>
It can be opaque and complex. It can also be one of those things to let really skilled players stand out. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332568637078634496))<br>
I&apos;ve said a few times lately that we&apos;re cool with difficult hoops for marginal gains. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332568887063347200))<br>
But if the gains aren&apos;t marginal then the hoops feel mandatory. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332568937529233408))<br>
Is there any way to win there? Or is this just another knife&apos;s-edge situation?<br>
We just need to make sure that players who want to skip those complications still have fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332573407466123266))<br>
<br>
so why does shape shifting as a druid clear movement impaires but not shaman&apos;s ghost wolf? + the additional 10% speed increase<br>
That&apos;s just a druid class benefit. We try not to have every class mechanic work the exact same way. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331572315148124161))<br>

are you happy with how the current dk resource system works? Or do you feel the rune system was better in wrath?<br>
Honestly not sure. Current model solves the orphaned rune and GCD lock problems better, but it is complicated. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332549022998999041))<br>
<br>
Why weren&apos;t DK dots nerfed to refresh their strength instead of messing with the numbers on FeS, SS, and UM?<br>
We wanted the Festerblight style to be optional, not mandatory. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331925261006303232))<br>
It doesn&apos;t look like much of an option anymore as it now relies on getting tricks + unrealistic execution to be optimal<br>
The problem might be Tricks. We may have overnerfed the FB damage. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331937345576263680))<br>

any though on makeing more glyphs baseline like glyph of lifebloom for resto druids?<br>
When it makes sense. If we make every good glyph baseline then we need to make more glyphs (and hope they aren&apos;t too good). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331927391133917184))<br>

Many hunters want a MM completely re-design. Possible?<br>
I would use that word with caution. It would not be at the warlock level. Are there things we can do? Yes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332644407037800448))<br>
<br>
Marks/Surv feel less developed now that most of their appeals were made into talents. They feel less flavorful now<br>
We want the spec choice to come down to kit or specific rotation. (Agree that hunters need work on both.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332552307747196928))<br>
Marks rotation feels like the most rewarding. BS baseline will be nice. BM is more survivable than survival though<br>
My perception (which could be wrong) is SV hunters are the most likely to be sad when they can&apos;t play their spec. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332638856845328384))<br>
<br>
So what&apos;s the verdict on Scater/Trap DR GC?<br>
We aren&apos;t changing it for 5.3 (meaning it will be as on live). We nerfed some BM pet CC instead. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331927629986922496))<br>

Can you give any insight as to why the Cata version of Sacred Shield was removed from Ret? And is it possible it will return?<br>
Honestly, it&apos;s because in Cata so many paladins asked for the LK version back. I guess we could alternate every expansion. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331870450353336323))<br>
Is it not possible to have the Cata version of Sacred Shield baseline for Ret while also having the talent choice?<br>
One of the issues is that Ret mostly takes SH while Prot only takes SS. Maybe both Ret and Prot would want (Cata) SS as a talent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331923562137014272))<br>
Could replace current talent with the Cataclysm Sacred Shield and give the current one to Prot baseline I guess. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331870657967173632))<br>

Will enhancement get a overhaul/ new resource system anytime soon? Feels old and clunky and enhance got so much potential! <br>
Overall, we don&apos;t foresee adding new resources (like Holy Power or Embers) to any existing classes or specs soon. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331929459164868608))<br>
We&apos;re pretty happy with Enhance&apos;s cooldown-driven rotation. Major changes aren&apos;t likely soon. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331929325333016576))<br>
<br>
Could we at least ask for options to modify ascendance damage and move it to outside the cooldown?<br>
The concern is that shifting too much DPS out of CDs makes the CDs feel meh. It&apos;s nice when you can really feel them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332538391759560705))<br>
This may be true but it changes the pvp meta game. Some may like it but I don&apos;t and some of my mates quit.<br>
That&apos;s the concern and why we&apos;re floating the idea out there rather than just doing it for 5.3. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332573565054513152)<br>

Are you done with affliction pvp for 5.3? I am not playing ptr so i would love to know how do you think its performing atm.<br>
We don&apos;t get a ton of PvP testing on smaller patches like this so most of our information is just player feedback. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330485955624574976))<br>
We like Aff rotation in PvE, but we&apos;re worried that MG and SB:SS hold them back in PvP. Would rather just have strong dots. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330486134591336448))<br>
<br>
Currently, RoF feels really clunky for Warlocks to use in single target fights, but it&apos;s required. Any plans to change this? To which I mean, doesn&apos;t feel like it belongs there in the single target rotation. Just feels clunky and annoying. Thoughts?<br>
We agree. We didn&apos;t remove it for 5.3 because we&apos;d want to buff ember generation to compensate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332549925609037824))<br>
<br>
When would we see the change to increase ember generation (without relying on RoF to generate embers)?<br>
My guess is 5.4. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332548862063546369))<br>

How come arms warriors lost shield slam/shield block if you want to do more with them?<br>
Because shield macros suck. You will see quite often our dev style is one step back, two steps forward. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330443571293466625))<br>
We make short-term changes that are good for the game but against our long-term goals, which understandably confuses players. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330443687714750464))<br>
<br>
Warriors are just HORRIBLE on PTR. Dead in three seconds, dominated by ranged classes. Enough already.<br>
What changed from live? We buffed warrior defenses and no caster should have gotten large DPS buffs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330760671304249346))<br>
<br>
So you are saying you can&apos;t just put down a blocking volume around your Battlegrounds edges to stop that?<br>

Toxic Behavior<br>
What did you think of Riot&apos;s Toxic Player Behavior presentation at GDC? Any lessons that can be applied to WoW?<br>
I think it&apos;s awesome. A lot of lessons that can be applied to WoW (or any game) but hard to go into via twitter. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331888348031483904))<br>
<br>
What do you think Blizz can do better, if anything, to combat toxic attitudes within the WoW community?<br>
Interesting Q. We removed the need for friends in order to see content, which is awesome, but we didn&apos;t insert anything in place. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331877507831824385))<br>
With friends, you are happy somebody got loot. In LFR, other players are tools to get what you want. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331877709544300544))<br>
Providing more info to players so they didn&apos;t have to know all the tribal secrets would help. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331878096884101121))<br>
Letting you care a little more about the group would help. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331878082350829569))<br>

Player Subscription Losses<br>
You have lost 1.3 million subscribers because the game is to time consuming for us casuals. Bring back tabards. Dailies suck<br>
We heard from A LOT of players in Cataclysm that they didn&apos;t have enough to do and got bored. It&apos;s a tough sweet spot to hit. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332556505230503938))<br>
<br>
I hope you folks realize your sub drop cannot continue <br>
I can&apos;t imagine the original devs expected the game to go on as long as it has. Keep playing and we&apos;ll keep developing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332555976291000320))<br>
<br>
Activision Q1: 1.3M lost subs, how much was PVE &amp; PVP? Can you hear player feedback now? Class balance &amp; cut time sinks!<br>
The losses were mostly in Asia. China&apos;s game market has matured amazingly in only a few years. They release many MMOs a year. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332550598371184640))<br>
<br>
LFR has cut into raiders avail for normals. Low motivation since end boss killed on release. Led to sub-unsub cycle?<br>
Most of the losses were in Asia, where the raiding culture is pretty different. Recall, they have 3 lockouts already. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332539558656892928))<br>
<br>
Another 1.3 million subscribers gone. Can we start agreeing that maybe pushing out new dailies every patch is not great?<br>
Players come for new expansions and then drift away. This is nothing new and why we are trying to release expansions faster. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332541745776689152))<br>
<br>
Misc<br>
You may be releasing patches fast but most of them are bare bones. 2 major patches = 2 daily hubs and a raid. The end.<br>
What is a patch that you thought offered a reasonable amount of content? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331892331668197378))<br>
5.2 was good but would have been better with a 5 man or 2. But least you aknowledge no 5 mans was a mistake.<br>
Not a mistake, in that we wouldn&apos;t change it if we could do it all again. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331926115717353473))<br>

<br>
Why is it a problem if I like to repeatedly run dungeons? Am I doing it wrong if that&apos;s what I find fun?<br>
Nope, and we try to support it. We just don&apos;t make that the most rewarding way because we think it&apos;s good for the long term game. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331875041534959616))<br>
We have found that making things too convenient and letting players focus too much on small parts of the game leads to burn out. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331875178562850816))<br>
I know it might seem a paradox that a more convenient game is less compelling, but our data supports it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331875469198778369))<br>
Yet your two most succesful expansions had it as the most rewarding way. What you are doing is WRONG<br>
Our two most successful expansions had terrible class balance too. I&apos;m not sure that&apos;s why they were successful. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332565847824551936))<br>

You forced me to do what I don&apos;t like or even hate: scenarios, dailies, pet battles, brawler guild and etc.<br>
I can understand scenarios and dailies. Why would you do pet battles and brawler&apos;s guild if you don&apos;t enjoy them? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332543112524218368))<br>
There are achievements for pet battles? You have to gain them even if you hate it.Just so others can see big numbers<br>
Achievements are the epitome of optional. If you&apos;re saying you are forced to do achievements then... I don&apos;t know. More gin. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332635750170492928))<br>

Just to play devils advocate. I would like 1 raid + Silvermoon, please. Then you will say &quot;The majority would not&quot;.<br>
I don&apos;t know what the majority would say. But we don&apos;t design around majorities. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331880504515248128))<br>
The majority would say buff paladins because they are often the most popular class. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331880590955663360))<br>

The vast majority of the playerbase enjoy slower patches so we can enjoy one&apos;s content longer. ICC was great.<br>
