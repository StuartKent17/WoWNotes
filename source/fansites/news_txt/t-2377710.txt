Upcoming Changes to the NA WoW MVP Program
Hey guys!

Over the past year we've had it on our plate to breathe a bit of life in the MVP program for World of Warcraft you may have seen me mention it here and there, and I know the MVPs have been eagerly waiting for movement on this. After nearly a year of discussions, we're finally ready to start moving forward with a refresh of the MVP program for World of Warcraft!

Most of our active posters here know that when the MVP program was founded, it's goal was to recognize active forums poster who contributed to our community through things like high-quality class guides or assisting and guiding new players with helpful information. While being active and posting in a constructive manner will still be something we take into account, we realize that we now live in a world with Icy Veins, Wowhead, Reddit, and numerous other communities that didn't necessarily exist at the onset of this project. This leads our MVP group to not being able to actively fulfill it's original purpose on our singular forums platform.

All of this led us to think we needed to be realigning the purpose of the program slightly, as we want to more actively empower the group to engage in discussions with us on various community issues, happening on the forums and in our greater community. This would also include working to provide insight into community and gameplay feedback they may see around the community, with direct conversations between the WoW community team and the WoW MVP group as a whole on a regular basis, much as we do in our conversations with folks on Reddit, Discord, etc., something that hasn't been utilized to its best.

To facilitate this, we will be moving the WoW MVP program to an application-based recruitment system, which will address a few concerns we have currently with the recruitment process, as well as letting us asked targeted questions to candidates during certain recruitment periods, and hopefully widening the audience. We expect to open recruitment early next week, after the President’s Day holiday, so be on the lookout for a thread if you're interested!

Of note, these changes DO NOT affect any region or franchise outside of World of Warcraft in North America, and these changes also do not apply to our awesome Customer and Technical Support MVPs who do great things.

We look forward to getting to work on the program and hearing your feedback!

I hope this doesn't mean Crepe is losing his MVP status. I notice community MVPs are not listed as being spared these changes.
We're asking the MVPs to reapply for the process, but we will be keeping everyone who is able to meet the newer standards going forward! 

I wouldn't expect any of the familiar faces you know to go away unless it's their own choice.


Combat Log Tool - Wipefest
Wipefest https://www.wipefest.net is a web tool that uses data from Warcraft Logs https://www.warcraftlogs.com/ to display insights and timelines for raid encounters.

Insights aim to answer common questions that you might have about each pull, such as "Who is soaking Annihilations on Garothi Worldbreaker https://www.wipefest.net/report/7HFRByQ6hYNA9wmc/fight/5?insights=2076-6?", or "What pod rotation did we use on Antoran High Command https://www.wipefest.net/report/yxW1hraPm9NfgcDR/fight/13?insights=2070-3?".

The timeline aims to provide a concise overview of the important events within a fight, such as major boss abilities, big cooldowns, and deaths. Timelines can be filtered easily, letting you quickly dig into certain mechanics, such as Fusillades, Fel Shields, and healing cooldowns https://www.wipefest.net/report/7HFRByQ6hYNA9wmc/fight/12?filters=R-MH09,2070-0F04, or if people used defensive cooldowns before they died https://www.wipefest.net/report/vkmJtn6pzA4WV1bC/fight/17?filters=R-0506PD0D.

You can also select players to focus in on them https://www.wipefest.net/report/cJtAzp6k8G2fTCNm/fight/15?filters=R-0HCR02AP0I0EMHMT0D,F-HEPPTMHS,H-AMLPGHFMVFRVRATK,PRHO-DHDPLFGSS1S2LC,2064-0ECW0GFBTPFDHS0NCIUPFO0bPE&focuses=140,35, giving you more information about the fight from their perspective. This feature still needs contributors to enable more specializations you can find out more at the GitHub repository https://github.com/JoshYaxley/Wipefest.EventConfigs/.

There's also a Discord server https://discord.gg/QhE4hfS for any questions and suggestions!

Venruki and Ziqo’s European Cup #1 MVP

MVP: Wallirik – XRB to the moon

During the European Qualifier Cup #1, Wallirik rose to the top of the heap as Ziqo and Venruki’s choice for MVP. As a part of a Warlock, Shaman, Druid team, Wallirik landed crucial spell locks and fears throughout the tournament to keep Zeepeye alive. According to Ziqo, not only was he solid defensively, he was also able to “180 situations” and generate “instant kills” using combinations with his Thalkiels consumption. This combination of offensive and defensive plays put him as both analysts choice for MvP.

Honorable Mention: Tsx – Ascendant formerly known as Rockets Esports

Tsx caught us all off guard in Europe Cup #1. Having joined Rockets Esports just 1 hour before sign-ups closed, he immediately displayed his individual prowess landing impossible Polymorphs against defending World Champions ABC, leading to their elimination from the tournament. His aggressive playstyle became an instant hit with the analysts, fitting perfectly with Ratapai’s play style.

Snow Fight - A WarCraft Tale
During these cold winter months, we’ve got a children’s book for you that’s sure to warm even the Lich King’s icy heart. Snow Fight: A Warcraft Tale is an exciting adventure featuring little Arthas, Thrall, and Varian, who give bullying the cold shoulder and learn that games are better with fair play.

Written by Chris Metzen and illustrated by Wei Wang, the book was created with the idea of finding fun ways to share some of the Warcraft universe’s characters and ideas with kids. As Metzen says, telling lighter stories about our favorite heroes and villains seemed like a perfect way to share our passion for Warcraft with the young, imaginative minds we love most!
