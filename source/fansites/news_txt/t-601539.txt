Boubouille2007-07-16, 07:17 PMBlizzard released a new movie on Worldofwarcraft.com  It's a video of the song "I am murloc" performed by L70ETC. Check their page on WoWWiki  for more infos about them. 

"Having leveled past their previous name -- Level 60 Elite Tauren Chieftain -- the crunching chords and pounding war drums of the newly dubbed Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftain will once again be echoing throughout the Anaheim Convention Center's main arena at BlizzCon 2007. Exclusive to BlizzCon attendees, the concert will start at 7:30pm on Saturday, August 4, preceding the other live entertainment that evening. Get there early because seating will be first-come, first-pwned."


 

We might see them in game in some occasions, there is at least one of their song in game, and multiple spells  with their name.
