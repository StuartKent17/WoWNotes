Azeroth&#x2019;s keepers use seeds of the ancients to nourish and revitalize the flame-scarred slopes surrounding Mount Hyjal&#x2014;but this isn&#x2019;t the only region left scarred by the Cataclysm. The Cenarion Circle seeks worthy champions to spread regrowth across the land by tending to a Blossoming Ancient, a sign of seasonal rebirth.<br>
