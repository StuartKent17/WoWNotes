This is now official, the sets we posted earlier are indeed the Tier 9 Armor models and multiple classes within the same faction will share the same armor model with different textures. <br>
In patch 3.2, Call of the Crusade, players will be able to work toward the all-new tier-9 class sets by competing in the Crusaders&apos; Coliseum. To keep with the themes of the Argent Tournament, players will notice this time around that the Horde and Alliance have unique looks to distinguish them apart. <br>
