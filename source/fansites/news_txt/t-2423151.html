We&apos;re currently working through a tuning package for Feral Druids.<br>
<br>
Specifically, we&apos;re adjusting Feral performance relative to other specs in dungeons and questing. Please know: we&apos;ve been reading all of the incoming feedback and keeping a close eye on player results in-game.<br>
<br>
Thank you for all of this feedback. Much of it has been very useful in determining the substance of this adjustment.<br>
<br>
This is something that we&apos;re testing carefully, and probably won&apos;t be finished and available to put into the live game until later this week. I&apos;ll let you know as soon as we have final numbers, and I&apos;ll post about it a final time when it goes live.<br>

Bounty Bag Rewards<br>
The bounty bag loot drops diminish after 1 bag looted per day. This is to prevent abuse of the system.</div></div>
