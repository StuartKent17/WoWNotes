Tank & Healer Ability Tuning
Are encounters going to be tuned to have longer time-to-kill for tanks as well?

I ask because in a world where tanks need to be actively healed, dying so quickly that they must be spammed all of the time read: less than 3 or 4 seconds for 100-0 just leads to a WotLK situation where one person gets to spam the tank forever and everyone else ignores it and nothing is really any different.
Absolutely, yes. It's very important that this is the case.

I'd like to note that "use Active Mitigation to avoid X ability" isn't usually engaging gameplay. How about I use AM because it helps me survive a powerful attack, not because I get a debuff if I don't.
Binary AM checks like you mention will continue to be extremely rare. They're still an interesting mechanic to see everyone once in a while, but will not be common. Sorry if what I said gave the impression otherwise. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

New Logging Feature: COMBATANT_INFO
Cool, yeah most bonus IDs should be relatively easy to determine from the item level. The only bonuses that would be tricky are things like stat variations on e.g. crafted or baleful items, and bonus minor stats on items. Using the stats you could determine that they have e.g. ~3 items with movement speed... but you wouldn't really know how much and on which items.

You shouldn't need any guessing. Random tertiaries and sockets are a great point about being missing; I'll follow up on that. You really should have everything you need to reconstruct their gear. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 

Classic Realms
Tom Chilton Game Director for World of Warcraft answered a question about classic servers during the BlizzCon 2015 World of Warcraft Q&A.

While we realise there is a desire for servers running previous versions of the game, we do not have any plans to setup classic servers. The old code is designed to run on the old hardware. The old code brings with it the old data, which includes the old bugs. The natural expectation from players would be that we would fix these bugs to ensure a smooth gameplay experience along with the need for Customer Support and other dedicated support teams for such realms.

We feel it is not feasible to support multiple versions of World of Warcraft concurrently, and instead believe that our resources would be better placed continuing to build upon the current live game. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

the lovely folk at @BlizzardCS tell me that you are the ones to talk to for getting a tabard locker for my 50+ tabards?
Tabards are included in the #Legion Transmog improvements, so you have a lot of free closet space in your future! WarcraftDevs 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
What's your opinion on limited-access forums readable to public? Example: Master+ and Devs only, readable by public.
It greatly helps to problem of player to dev ratio being so skewed. Just have to avoid whiff of elitism. OccupyGStreet 


Legion - Kobolds
You will encounter the Kobolds again in Legion and learn a little bit about their history!
Kobolds live here long time. Make home in nooks.
Catch rats. Sometimes eat them.
Dig for treasure. Trade with harpies.
They like shinies, we like wax. Fresh from ears is best.
One day drogbar come in. Say cave is theirs.
They smash and scare. We take candles and hide.
Drogbar big and stupid. They have cave, but no have candle.
Darkness finds them. Darkness follows them.
Darkness swallows them whole!
We come back. We have candles.
Cave ours again. Candles keep us safe.
