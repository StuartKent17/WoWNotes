Stormsong Valley’s beekeepers report that a buzzare pheromenon is about to take place in the region. 

Swarm Stormsong Valley
In the next few weeks, savvy insect enthusiasts will be able to uncover the secrets of a new hive in the mountains of Stormsong Valley. Perhaps a small companion will be able to show you the way . . .

Long Live the Queen
Alliance players can work with Barry the Beekeeper to locate Stormsong Valley’s newest hive and court the favor of the Hivemother in order to purchase bee-themed items and earn a new bumble bee mount, the Honeyback Harvester.

While most Harvesters dream only of honey and flowers, this adventurous specimen looks to the wide world beyond Stormsong Valley.

Pirates Day - September 19th
Pirate's Day is coming to Azeroth tomorrow!
Hoist sail and make way for Booty Bay because Pirate’s Day begins September 19!

Bring Your Sea Shanty to Booty Bay
Pirates have taken over the goblin town of Booty Bay and Captain DeMeza is recruiting any scurvy dog she can into her buccaneer ranks. Visit her or her henchmen in the capital cities if the pirate’s life is for you!

Feeling out of place in Booty Bay without a proper costume? Don’t worry. /Dance one little jig with the Dread Captain DeMeza and she’ll be impressed enough to press you into her crew and outfit you properly. If you get attached to your new look, you can do the quest You’re Gonna Need a Bigger Boat! Succeed, and you’ll get an Emergency Pirate Outfit or five for when Pirate’s Day is but a distant memory and your inner pirate is clawing to get out.

What good is a pirate without an avian companion on their shoulder? Captain DeMeza for the exchange of a few shiny coins can help you call forth a temporary companion named Petey to take with you wherever you sail.

From time to time the captain will shout for a brave party to take on a terror of the deeps–an elite shark known as Ol’Eary. Make sure you have a hearty crew with you or you could become just so much chum in the waters of the bay.

Join the Beach Party


https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/september/thumb/piratesday01.jpg https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/september/piratesday01.jpg

Once you and your crew have helped the captain handle Ol’Eary, you can celebrate with the crew at a little beach party just south of Booty Bay. Those with the Feat of Strength "Advast Ye, Admiral" can also purchase a toy from Edward Techt–the Jolly Roger to show off their dedication to the cause.

If you’re really feeling generous, you can also purchase a Big Bag of Booty from Captain DeMeza and spread the wealth around to all your pirate pals in a burst of glittery glory.
