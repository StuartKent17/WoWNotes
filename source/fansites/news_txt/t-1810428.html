Mythic Hellfire Citadel Progression<br>

Warlords PvP Season 2 Begins<br>
With boots and boards and helms and swords, the time has come to strike once more! Warlords of Draenor Arena and Battleground Season 2 has begun, and Horde and Alliance leaders are calling all of their champions to seek victory on the glorious field of battle.<br>
<br>
Before you set foot in an Arena or on a Battleground, keep in mind the following adjustments that have been made for this season:<br>
<br>
The PvP iLevel of Honor and Conquest gear has increased.<br>
<br>
All gear now scales up to iLvl 690.<br>
Wild Aspirant gear is iLvl 700.<br>
Wild Combatant gear is iLvl 715.<br>
Wild Gladiator gear is iLvl 730.<br>
<br>
Any PvE gear over iLvl 715 will be scaled down to iLvl 715.<br>
Winning Rated Battlegrounds and completing the weekly Ashran Dominance quest now awards you a random piece of PvP iLvl 730 Conquest gear.<br>
<br>
<br>
Good luck, and may your enemies fall before you this season!<br>

Ashran Queue Times<br>
The Ashran queue times for many are far from ideal. We&apos;re constantly evaluating them and adding more servers as necessary. Due to the demand from Horde and Alliance, we just increased capacity by 50%. We&apos;ll continue to monitor the situation. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/378923-i-get-it-after-missing-ashran-queue/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18300109896?page=1#11))<br>

Kazzak Bonus Rolls<br>
Just killed Kazzak. Got no loot (even gold) except the Apexis and Felblight. I couldn&apos;t use a bonus roll, and my raid lockouts have me saved to him. What just happened?<br>
We&apos;re aware of the issue with players being unable to use a bonus roll on Kazzak and are working on a fix. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/378866-no-loot-from-kazzak-no-bonus-roll/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18194515559?page=3#50))<br>
<br>
Random Battleground Strongboxes<br>
The intention, as Trill quoted above, is that winning three Rated BG&apos;s awards a Strongbox with a guaranteed item in it. That system is currently not working, and so the Strongboxes aren&apos;t being awarded.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re currently chasing down what is causing the issue, so we can fix it. Unfortunately, we will most likely not be able to retroactively award Strongboxes as part of this fix. We&apos;ll provide an update once we&apos;ve traced down the issue and sorted out a fix.<br>
<br>
After the fix can we do 3 more RBGs then and get the box then? Or are we just out of luck for the week<br>
I can&apos;t say for absolute certain until we&apos;ve tracked down exactly what&apos;s causing the issue, but we believe that will be the case, yes.<br>
<br>
do you not test stuff on the ptr?<br>
It was working on the PTR, and in our internal testing, which is why it&apos;s a tricky issue to track down. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/378806-confusion-behind-rbg-gear/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18193986297?page=1#17))<br>

Loque&apos;nahak lost his unique combat kitty sounds, and is now generic spirit beast cat sounds. Intended? :&lt;<br>
That&apos;s... odd, what did it sound like before? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613584170464362496))<br>
<br>
I&apos;d like to add that as a new player, checking the class trainer really gave an incentive to level to gain power.<br>
See now that&apos;s a really interesting point, seeing what&apos;s coming. Oh shit what&apos;s Pyroblast??? Good call. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613615708090437632))<br>

is the Corrupted Nest Guardian (pet off Shadow-Lord Iskar) bonus rollable?<br>
Yes. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/613825314230173696))<br>
<br>
Is &quot;Securing Draenor&quot; achv not account-wide? don&apos;t have credit for it on a different char under the &quot;Draenor Pathfinder&quot; meta<br>
Not account wide, but you only need to have it on one character for it to count towards the Pathfinder achievement. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/613828526513373184))<br>
<br>
Felblight &quot;or fishing in Tanaan&quot; is that just schools or both open water and schools?<br>
Great question! Felblight can only be fished out of Felmouth Frenzy schools. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/613832194990018561))<br>

Hey guys, got a quick question. Can you explain pls what&apos;s up with Yrel and Grom who suddenly became best friends?<br>
Consider it an uneasy truce, when the true enemy is revealed and really terrible/green. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613629347962818560))<br>
so, why exactly did we kill Ner&apos;zhul then? The guys who wanted to protect his clan gets killed.<br>
The void seems bad. Like, not good. Like bad. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613630057135771648))<br>
<br>
Saw the Archimonde defeat trailer, and... is Grommash seriously getting away with murdering so many people? Everything forgiven?<br>
I don&apos;t think everything is forgiven, but he&apos;s seen the atrocities of the Legion, and neither side wants more bloodshed. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613602807115952128))<br>
It&apos;s better than our Draenor, Outland. An uneasy truce keeps Karabor standing. Maraad died for something after all. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613602951114813440))<br>
Because the atrocity of the legion is worst than the atrocity of the iron horde, it&apos;s just &quot;k, we are cool&quot;?Hire a writer<br>
Have you played through all of the 6.2 quest content to see how this plays out? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613642778870837250))<br>
Grom faces really no consequence for all the evil he&apos;s done. Same for scapegoating all Cata Horde decisions on Garrosh<br>
IMO, this is not our world. If Grommash and Yrel can live in harmony, it is a better world. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613623089876709376))<br>
That&apos;s the point. They shouldn&apos;t be able to. Her sister died because of him. Her people died. He&apos;s responsible.<br>
He still has armies at his command, what would combat gain? More death? Imo the Draenei are above this. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/613643047587307520))<br>
