Children&#x2019;s Week Has Arrived! May 2-May 9<br>
It&#x2019;s time to give back to the children of Azeroth during Children&#x2019;s Week! Take an orphan under your wing and show them the wonders of the world.<br>
<br>
Throughout the year, the orphans of Azeroth spend much of their time wandering their home cities, dreaming of the day they&#x2019;ll be old enough (and big enough) to go out into the world to experience the adventures and marvels they&#x2019;ve missed as children. During Children&#x2019;s Week, the giving souls of the Horde and the Alliance can help make those dreams come true.<br>
<br>
What&#x2019;s New<br>
This year players are able to give back to the Kul Tiran and Zandalari children, who will accompany volunteers on two new quest lines.<br>
<br>
Alliance adventurers will meet Liam, a Kul Tiran child who wants help deciding what kind of person he wants to be when he grows up. You&#x2019;ll escort him all over the island and introduce him to pirates, tidesages, the Roughneck gryphon riders, Arom&#x2019;s Stand falconers, and the Thornspeaker druids.<br>
<br>
Heroes of the Horde will take a casteless Zandalari child, Azala, across Zuldazar to help her choose a loa. Soar Pa&#x2019;ku&#x2019;s skies, speak with Gonk, hop over to Krag&#x2019;wa, unearth treasure in The Golden Isle, and steal from Sethraliss.<br>
<br>
Charitable players who complete the quest lines can earn four new pets: Mr. Crabs, Beakbert, Froglet, and Scaley.<br>
<br>
Speak with Orphan Matron Westerson or Padae in Zuldazar to embark on these new quest lines.<br>

Activities<br>
Many orphans wish they had someone special to show them the wonders of the world. Throughout the year, they often spend their time wandering around their home cities of Stormwind or Orgrimmar, dreaming of the day they&#x2019;ll be old enough (and big enough) to go out into the world to seek the adventures and sights they&#x2019;ve missed as a child. During Children&#x2019;s Week, the giving souls of the Horde and the Alliance can help make those dreams true.<br>
