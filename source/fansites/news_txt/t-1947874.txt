Draenor Dungeons Bonus Event
Through the end of the day on Monday, join your comrades and take on Draenor dungeons. This week’s Bonus Event rewards you when you defeat dungeon enemies on Heroic and Mythic difficulties.

Make sure to pick up the event-only quest Emissary of War in your Garrison before you head out. It rewards you with Valor and an Iron Fleet Treasure Chest containing one Hellfire Citadel Heroic quality item that you won’t want to pass up.

Which of the Draenor dungeons takes you the longest to complete? 


Legion Pet Battle Tuning
We’re getting close to deploying some changes to pet battles that we’ll test in the Legion Alpha. We wanted to outline some of them here for you, so that you have a thread in which you can talk about this with us. As always, these are changes we’re testing, subject to further change, not final, etc.

Undead racial

During its invulnerability round, the active Undead pet will now do -25% damage. Developer note: The Undead racial ability has been one of the most powerful, and this change should help bring it in line with the others.


Frog Kiss + Sleeping Gas

Now has a 1-round cooldown. Dev note: The ability to chain stun opponents until resilience kicks in simply feels bad. Rather than a blanket change to resilience, we’re trying a surgical change to one of the more aggravating aspects.


Thunderbolt, Avalanche, Grave Destruction, Carpnado, Arcane Storm, and Psionic Strom

Base Damage reduced by approximately 15%Thunderbolt
Will now have a 5-Round cooldown, to match the other abilities with similar damage and effect.Cleave
Added 1-round cooldown Dev note: AoE abilities are very powerful in the current battle pet metagame, especially “meteor”-type abilities, which are quite effective against both groups of enemies and single targets. This should bring them closer to their intended power level.


Graves

Clobber and Bonestorm slots swapped Dev note: Graves has a bit too easy of a time damaging the entire enemy team. Though we see other setups with Graves, it’s been too easy to AoE, and a bit too powerful among AoE pets. We are wary of opening up additional new Graves combos with this change, and we’ll be testing this closely and reading all of your feedback.
Graves’ base stats changed: At level 25, Graves’ Speed will now be 244 was 211, Power will now be 297 was 314, and Health will now be 1587 was 1668. Dev note: Graves’ base stats, along with the Undead racial which favors slow pets, made him an unfortunate opponent to play against. Combined with high AoE and Consume Corpse, he had very few downsides. This change should help bring his output in-line with other, similar pets.


Overall, this constitutes a triple nerf to Graves. However, depending on your ability choices, you may consider the Clobber/Bonestorm slot swap an improvement. Please feel free to leave your feedback in this thread, and we’ll be here reading and responding where necessary.

Thank you very much!

Is there a way, even if we can't transfer characters, to copy our pets from live to alpha? Pretty hard to test some of the changes without actually having full options. Or at least "premade" pet battle teams?
I'm looking into all of this. I'll get back to you here.

Hello Assistant Game Director. Can you shed light on why Havoc DH only have 14 abilities while other classes have 25+ in Alpha?
Most classes went through multiple expansions of "ok, need to add 4 buttons for levels" vs. a new, lean class. Hard to compare WatcherDev 
That said, talents add more. What do you feel the DH currently lacks? WatcherDev 

Question for the room: What Blizzard cinematic did you have the most visceral "HELL YEAH" moment while watching?
the inevitable future one boldly featuring gnomes Muffinus

Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
the class is fun. Homogenization RUINED favorite classes, why bring x when y is easier and does it better
That was always the case. Why bring a Mage when the lock had more utility? You can't bring every spec. OccupyGStreet 

to homogenize but a reason to take an in depth look at the shaman, if you removed blood lust and people stop...
If there are no group buffs, you bring the highest dps often rogue. If there are, you being the best buffs lust. OccupyGStreet 
I don't think 30+ unique but completely equal group utility roles is realistic or manageable for groups. OccupyGStreet 

I think the bring the class problem is just a problem by having far too many classes and also sub classes.
Yeah we often wondered if the game had 10 classes or 30. I know that number has grown since. OccupyGStreet
