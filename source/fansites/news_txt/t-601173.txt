Boubouille2007-04-01, 03:59 PMDeath and Taxes http://www.dtguilds.com released a video of the encounter ... So why would you download it ?
First, because smaller is better, and it's only a 44mb file.
Their Lurker Below strategy is shown for the first time on video and is very different from what we saw before.
