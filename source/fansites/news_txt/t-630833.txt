Patch 3.0.8 going live this week
Patch 3.0.8 is going live this week, this isn't official yet but ... oh well, you know how it works. This post will be updated in the next few hours because with all the 3.0.8 undocumented changes I forgot, please point out any error/missing change in comments. 


Minor Bugs
When the next minor content patch is released players may notice two separate issues. The warlock spell Ritual of Summoning can only be used once every two minutes. Additionally, there are some human female animation errors, specifically when using two-handed weapons or shooting with a ranged weapon. Both of these issues are actively being addressed and we hope to have a fix available shortly after the patch releases. 


Enchantment reagents changes
A lot of enchantment recipes have been changed and now require less/different reagents.
