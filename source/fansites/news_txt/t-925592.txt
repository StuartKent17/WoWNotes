Road to Patch 4.2

Encounter Journal
The Encounter Journal is an in-game encylopedia listing everything you need to know on instances and raid bosses. Assuming people start using it regularly, it will probably fix a lot of issues people had in pick up groups where people were just too afraid to ask what a boss does and would rather die than look stupid and get kicked. 

The encounter journal can be accessed from the bottom menu bar or by hitting CTRL + Shift + J on your keyboard.

You will then access the instance selection menu with a "Dungeons" and "Raids" tabs, allowing you to get details on any raid or dungeon encounter introduced in Cataclysm including the Firelands raid

Encounter Journal - Boss Loot Lists
The encounter journal includes a list of items dropped by each boss with a couple of extra features:



The list can be filtered for 10 and 25-Man encounters. It doesn't really change anything these days but it will probably be useful if an item is only available in 25-Man at some point, or when older raids are supported. 
The "Heroic Mode" filter is also available in the loot list and will display loot from the Heroic version.
A filter by class, to easily get a list of the gear relevant to your class only. The Druid filter automatically lists all the items in the instance
You can also list the loot from all the bosses in the instance by clicking the Chest icon when at the Boss selection screen.

Boss Information and Abilities
The main objective of the Encounter Journal is to give you all the information you need to engage a boss without being clueless about what's going to happen to you and your raid. The journal provides you with:



A description of all the abilities used by the boss.
A description of all abilities used by NPC adds that might spawn during the encounter. Hostile and Friendly
The evolution of the fight over multiple stages. 
A general idea of how mechanics work. 
An "heroic only" filter to display abilities and variations of the fight only happening in Heroic Mode. 


You might also notice a couple of icons icons next to some of the spells. Those are alerts used to bring your attention to important point of the fights, 12 Alerts are available in the current version of the Encounter Journal:

Beth'tilac
Matriarch of the Cinderweb Brood, Beth'tilac and her merciless offspring sate their appetites by sucking the magma and fire from the corpses of elementals.

Stage One: The Cinderweb
Beth'tilac retreats to the top of her web at the beginning of the encounter.

Cinderweb Spinners dangle from the web above on a filament strand. Using Taunt or a similar ability on a Spinner will cause them to drop to the ground. Once killed, their web filament remains. Players may then interact with the filament and move to the top of the web.
