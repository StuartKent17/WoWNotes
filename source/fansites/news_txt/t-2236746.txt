Do you continue to gain stamina per point past 52 in concordance?
Yes, your health increases at a reduced rate compared to prior points. However, tank + healer bonus damage doesn't increase after point 52. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/871796808627789825

PvP
could we get an explanation on why s3 pvp elite appearance is being released at the end of s4 
The ensembles become available when those appearances can no longer be obtained in rated PvP. Legion Seasons 3&4 share an armor appearance. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/870729017216741376

does anyone know if u account change a char if u have to do 150 wins all over again?
No, transferring a character to another account does not reset the number of wins-- only a faction transfer resets the number of wins. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/872529155736219648

Could you guys take a look at southshore vs. Tarren Mill again? Particularly at the balance, for the alliance. Thanks.
We learned a great deal from this first run of Southshore vs. Tarren Mill, and weâ€™ll make adjustments for next time. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/872560517918871552

is Concordance capped at 52first pt in rated pvp?
There is no cap. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/872560757912633344

Can you verify that you need 150 wins on a toon to get Gladiator Legion Season 3 or just for R1?
Both Gladiator and Cruel Gladiator require 150 wins. All other titles require 50 wins. WarcraftDevs https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/872560886266736641

WIll saved up pvp tokens Echoes go away with the end of season? Or will they persist through season end?
They are converted to gold at end of season. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/872668203024924674

Muff man! where is Varimithras the best dreadlord ever its not a secret is it?
No one knows, but one thing's for sure: Sargeras probably isn't too happy with him. Muffinus https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/870660828315262978

The murloc demon hunter in Stormheim during invasions - is he canon? If yes, how did he come to be?
