Do you continue to gain stamina per point past 52 in concordance?
Yes, your health increases at a reduced rate compared to prior points. However, tank + healer bonus damage doesn't increase after point 52. WarcraftDevs

The ensembles become available when those appearances can no longer be obtained in rated PvP. Legion Seasons 3&4 share an armor appearance. WarcraftDevs

No, transferring a character to another account does not reset the number of wins-- only a faction transfer resets the number of wins. WarcraftDevs

There is no cap. WarcraftDevs
