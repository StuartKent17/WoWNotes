Classes<br>
Thought: cleave dps useless in some fights; cleave healing useful much more often. Will all cleave gear be given to healers?<br>
That&apos;s something that we agree is a problem. We&apos;re considering solutions, but aren&apos;t ready to announce anything quite yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414217430966095872))<br>

Any chance you guys will add a depth of field effect to WoW&apos;s engine?<br>
Gone back and forth for a while now. I usually turn it off in other games in favor of visibility, value vs. investment situation. (Source (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/410574164320198656))<br>
<br>
Could Death Knights get options for complexions like Razuvious&apos; and the other DKs in Nax? Pale with dark tattoos?<br>
This falls into the custom skins category, something I&apos;d love to get in. Thanks for the suggestion! (Source (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/410581357136330752))<br>
<br>
Hope to have update and new visuals for you all at beginning of new year-new stuff is looking even better than what we&apos;ve already shown! (Source (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/415204106110636032))<br>
Your work so far is superb. Stoked to see what&apos;s in store. Give me Trolls please! Big muscular ones, tired of being skinny!<br>
I hear that Troll Growth Hormone (tgh) can help with that. (Source (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/415250524309450752))<br>
jungle trolls were never muscular,check your facts. Plz dont change the trolls that ppl been playing for years<br>
we won&apos;t dramatically change what exists now. Maybe a future option if we&apos;re able to add that level of customization (Source (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/415516207643508736))<br>
<br>
Character / Items<br>
Reforging makes one less reliant on bis and less gear is sharded.<br>
Remember, you have a significantly wider array of gear available than before. Reforging also made all gear feel more the same. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409904589027033088))<br>
<br>
DOn&apos;t know if this has been asked or not but, when i switch spec and an armor piece has a gem in it will it vanish?<br>
No. It won&apos;t change what the gem is. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417354764175675393))<br>
Is this by design or technical limitation?<br>
By design. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417386706921205760))<br>
Doesn&apos;t this favor using secondary gems if not min maxing/not a class that has primary stat=primary sta(int/int)t between specs?<br>
There are no more primary stat gems. Only secondary stat gems. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417389000463114240))<br>
<br>
Simple question. Yes or No. Will Sockets ONLY exist via Bonus?<br>
Still undecided for sure, but at least the vast majority of sockets will be via bonus. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408754280259002369))<br>
<br>
I don&apos;t think it was ever mentioned - will it be possible to enchant or gem Tertiary stats in WoD?<br>
Gem, no. Enchant... Not sure, but unlikely, other than perhaps continuing to have Speed to Boots, as has been traditional. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409911390304870401))<br>
Since the boot speed enchant is mandatory, why not just increase baseline speed and trim boot enchants?<br>
you may be surprised how &quot;mandatory&quot; it is to most people. Personally, I&apos;m pleased that it&apos;s as popular as it is. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409987370633547777))<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br>
Not really for pala(y for monk). Some stats are poor some are good. Readiness is extremely black or white though.<br>
No, it&apos;s not that black and white. We&apos;ll put enough on it to tune it. There&apos;s room between &apos;best stat&apos; and &apos;useless&apos;. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409047313437319168))<br>
When it comes to Readiness (if intended for big CD&apos;s) not much if any room between &quot;best&quot; and &quot;useless&quot;<br>
Completely false. We can tune its coefficient and what abilities it affects. Very granular. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409048702745985024))<br>
<br>
900 Readiness required encounter because you need X min DA/BoP. Screw using best gear, gotta use that 40ilvl less trinket. 2/2<br>
There will be certain amounts of readiness that you want for certain situations, but that will be highly situational. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409046983630807040))<br>
<br>
so cooldown reduction will only effect the same spells said trinkets effect? or could we see rotations affected?<br>
May be different spells than the trinkets. Still generally long CDs. May do rotational abilities where necessary. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416850957981339648))<br>
<br>
Id like clarification on the Dodge.parry change. Is it still going to exist as a base stat or is it removed 100%.<br>
Still exists as a mechanic, but won&apos;t be on gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409905747674157056))<br>
<br>
Although parry as a stat will be gone, will strength continue to increase chance to parry in WoD?<br>
Yes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/412336197512331264))<br>
<br>
How will the loss of dodge/parry effect monk tanks. We don&apos;t rely on armor. Don&apos;t want the best tank class to be dumbed down.<br>
It won&apos;t. Dodge/Parry are getting removed from gear, not overall. Nothing changes for Monks, who didn&apos;t have dodge/parry on gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417079463663247360))<br>
<br>
Any plans to make Armor gems a thing in WoD?<br>
Yes. All of the new secondaries will be gemmable. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416692162315579392))<br>
<br>
Warlords of Draenor<br>
quick toy box question: are toy items going to work cross faction like mounts? (e.g. Darkspear&gt;Gnomeregan pride if they&apos;re in)<br>
Not involved w/ that design, but plenty of spells &amp; pets already work that way, so it&apos;s likely! (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/417018377526206464))<br>
<br>
Class Balance<br>
The reactions to tweets in the MMO-C DK community are making me giggle.<br>
Referring to my tweet about them misusing &quot;Scaling&quot;? Yeah.. Such a misunderstood word. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410884235709276160))<br>
Pro Tip: If you argue that you need buffs, and say that it&apos;s because of &quot;scaling&quot; issues, your argument loses credibility. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410884905023705089))<br>
There are a few exceptions to this, such as deep analysis such as Theck&apos;s. But most people use it as an &quot;I feel weak&quot; fallback (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410885206870999040))<br>
Is &quot;I feel weak&quot; necessarily useless? I mean it&apos;s not a reason to buff since feeling != actuality and some ppl are bad but...?<br>
No. I&apos;m just saying that &quot;I feel weak&quot; and &quot;I&apos;m weak because scaling&quot; are the same thing. &quot;Scaling&quot; isn&apos;t helping your argument. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410948082465898496))<br>
So, if you do not want us to call that an issue with &quot;scaling&quot;, what word would you like us to use to convey that issue?<br>
Trust me, I totally understand how EXACTLY what you describe is the impression you get. Missing piece is all the buffs/nerfs... (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410954444956635137))<br>
...that happened in between. Those likely had as much to do with power changes as the change in ilvl. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410955200778604544))<br>
I think it&apos;s important to remember that I am not, AT ALL, disagreeing with your feeling of weakness. Suggesting feedback types. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410955841160740865))<br>
So if we don&apos;t have a PhD in math we shouldn&apos;t post our concerns/opinions. Wow you lost all credibility right there.<br>
Didn&apos;t say that at all. Said that you aren&apos;t using scaling properly. Feedback still useful. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410900588499443712))<br>
So key points for using scaling are: Do you provide context? Is it a quantifiable issue? Do you have evidence to support that?<br>
Yep! (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410896578606411776))<br>
<br>
It&apos;s hard and frustrating to understand them, but we should try and not dismiss them just b/c &quot;scaling&quot;<br>
Not dismissing the feedback, just pointing out that people use &quot;scaling&quot; to make their argument sound credible. Actually opposite. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410892698669703170))<br>
