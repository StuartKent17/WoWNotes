Stoy2019-09-30, 12:12 PMPatch 8.2.5 Hotfixes - Arcane Mage Buff
We’re working on a tuning adjustment for Arcane Mages. With realm maintenance next week, we plan to:

Classes

 Mage Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator 

Arcane

Damage of all abilities increased by 8%.




As always, this change is a work in progress. We’ll let you know if we change plans, and you’ll see the final adjustment in the final hotfixes notes.

Thank you!
