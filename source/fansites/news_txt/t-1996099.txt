Legion - Loot Glow Effect
In Legion, bosses with loot remaining on them will have a special glow to visually indicate that there is still loot on the body. This glow has also appeared in several other places during the beta during Fishing, on some quest objects, and other NPCs but now seems to be only on bosses.

PvP
With PvP stats normalization in legion making twinking totally obsolete, time to merge exp and exp-disabled pvp brackets?
Both exp-disabled and exp-enabled players will be in the same PvP brackets in #Legion. WarcraftDevs 

Professions

In #Legion, Archaeology will not require a certain level to begin. WarcraftDevs 


Ghostcrawler Tweets
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.
I think there are 5 ways to achieve game longevity: 1 tons of content hard!, 2 reusable content same stuff, different rules... OccupyGStreet 
cont. 3 procedural content, 4 user-generated content, 5 multiplayer provides different experiences. What am I forgetting? OccupyGStreet 
What do you mean by procedural content?
The computer makes or mixes up  the content, like many Roguelikes OccupyGStreet 
I don't think it's necessarily one that fully qualifies, but reward structures can be a big deal for me.
No, that's a good one. Content is the same, but you are motivated to still do it. OccupyGStreet 
a good narrative!
Agreed, but I'd file that under lots of content, or else you exhaust the story too quickly. And it's hard. OccupyGStreet 
Speedruns/achievements maybe?
I meant speedruns under mods, kind of like difficulty adjustments or Halo skulls. OccupyGStreet 

"Make your peace with a finite game." I think it's ok to have stories end.
I agree. I wish more games did this and didn't try to be the only game I ever need. OccupyGStreet
