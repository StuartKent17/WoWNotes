Island Expeditions<br>
<br>
Developers&#x2019; notes: Following up on recent community feedback that we requested, a number of quality-of-life concerns led us to changes that we intend to address many frustrating combat experiences with certain Island ecologies.<br>
Azerite-themed enemies<br>
<br>
Enemies now prefer not to use Resonant Burst, Resonant Shield, and Volatile Geyser when a nearby enemy has recently used the ability.<br>

Removed the Knockback component of Resonant Backlash (triggered from Resonant Shield) on Normal and Heroic difficulties.<br>
Reduced the Knockback magnitude of Resonant Focus orbs on Normal and Heroic difficulties.<br>
Volatile Eruption&apos;s disorient effect (triggered from Volatile Geyser) has been reduced to 1 second on Normal and Heroic difficulties, and reduced to 2 seconds on Mythic difficulty (was 3 seconds).<br>
<br>
Kvaldir enemies<br>
<br>
Greatly reduced the magnitude of the two visibility-impacting effects (Fetid Mist, Eerie Fog) triggered from the Kvaldir invasion.<br>
<br>
Musken and Yak enemies<br>

Removed the knockback effect from Ram.<br>
