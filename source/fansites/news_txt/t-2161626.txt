Frost
Brain Freeze  procs gained while you already have a Brain Freeze active and unused will now be delayed slightly.

Developers’ notes: The delay on the second Brain Freeze will give the Mage time to use the first Brain Freeze proc. For example, the Mage might cast Frostbolt proc Brain Freeze, then Frostbolt proc Brain Freeze again, then instant Flurry, then Ice Lance, then Instant Flurry again, then Ice Lance.

Ebonbolt now travels slightly slower.

Developers’ notes: This allows the guaranteed Brain Freeze proc/instant Flurry cast immediately following it to land first, providing the Winter's Chill buff to that Ebonbolt. For example, the Mage might cast Frostbolt proc Brain Freeze, then Ebonbolt, and fully use both Brain Freeze procs.

The first missile from a Flurry cast should now hit sooner.

Developers’ notes: This allows a Frostbolt or Ebonbolt cast immediately before a Brain Freeze Flurry to more consistently benefit from that Flurry's Winter's Chill effect, even if the mage isn’t standing at long range. This allows the Frost Mage who has an active Brain Freeze to cast Frostbolt/Ebonbolt, then an Instant Flurry, then Ice Lance while standing 15+ yards from the target. Previously, the Mage had to be about twice as far away.
