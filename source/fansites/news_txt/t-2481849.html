As part of a renewed effort this year to maintain our focus on development, for our current games and our future projects, we won&#x2019;t have a booth at gamescom 2019. The show is an important one for the European and global gaming community, and we&#x2019;re going to miss meeting players in Cologne this year. You&#x2019;ll still be able to find Blizzard gear in the gamescom 2019 shop area, and we&#x2019;re looking forward to returning to the gamescom show floor in the future. We&#x2019;re also looking forward to sharing more details about the projects we&#x2019;re currently working on when the time is right.</div></div>
