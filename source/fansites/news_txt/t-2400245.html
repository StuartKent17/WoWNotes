Glowcap Festivalglowcap<br>
Glowcap Festival (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/648-glowcap-festival) allows players to help keep Fshoo (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/118509-fshoo) alive in Sporeggar to earn reputation. <br>
<br>
<br>
Head to Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh to take part in this holiday. <br>
Mushrooms will spawn around the town, giving you Glowcap (http://www.wowdb.com/items/24245-glowcap) and other helpful items:<br>
<br>
Sack of Healing Spores (http://www.wowdb.com/items/144276-sack-of-healing-spores) - Channeled heal for Fshoo.<br>
Sporeggium (http://www.wowdb.com/items/144261-sporeggium) - 2% healing buff per stack. Stacks to 100 times. <br>
Rimecap (http://www.wowdb.com/items/144265-rimecap) - Stop all damage and growth for 3 seconds, allowing healers to catch up.<br>
Fungal Lifestalk (http://www.wowdb.com/items/144262-fungal-lifestalk) - Instant 5% heal for Fshoo.<br>
<br>
You can purchase all four of the items above from Mycah (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/18382-mycah), the Sporeggar Quartermaster.<br>
You can also loot a Pungent Truffle (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235264-pungent-truffle), allowing you to transform into a sporeling for 24 hours.<br>
Fshoo spawns periodically, gaining stacks of Fshoo Grow (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235202-fshoo-grow). Each stack increases his size by 1% and health by 100%. <br>
Fshoo also loses health at a constant rate, making him harder and harder to heal as the grow stacks appear. <br>
Using the items and healing him to keep him alive as long as possible is the objective.<br>
When Fshoo dies he will give everyone 50 Sporeggar reputation for every stack of the buff he had. <br>
