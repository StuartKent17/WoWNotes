Recently I got a bunch of mails from people complaining about how hard it is to find Tier 10 models in the news archive. I had to postpone the 3.3 menu because of a few technical issues (Note: Borderlands and Torchlight are considered &quot;technical issues&quot;) and will be available very soon.<br>
<br>
While you wait, here is a small recap of the known Tier 10 models. <br>
<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight - I&apos;m still trying to fix a bug with the set appearance on some races, you&apos;ll have to wait a little to get a multi-race preview with helms. You can also check the Tier 10 Death Knight - Updated Video (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/tier-10-death-knight-updated-video/)<br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin - Your helm is most likely bugged, and we don&apos;t know yet if your set is a robe or not. Once again we&apos;ll have to wait before I do multi-race or even female screenshots. <br>
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman - The only thing I can give you for the moment is a great big hug while you cry on my shoulder. <br>

Achievement - Random Hallow&apos;s End Masks<br>
At this point we have no plans to make any changes to event or the achievements involved in it. I wouldn&apos;t say my advice was incorrect as I know a lot of people who got the achievements complete since I posted, but yes, the randomness can win sometimes. We welcome your feedback and will consider making changes for next year. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20860797990-where-are-the-hallows-end-blue-replies-now.html))<br>

Hybrid and base class abilities<br>
We agree with Communism. We often give classes situational spells as base class abilities rather than as talented abilities for the same reason -- you&apos;re really only out a little gold by learning the ability. This is particularly a problem for hybrids. Nearly every rogue can find a use for Fan of Knives. Balance and Feral druids have much less use for Nourish. Heroic Throw is clearly a tanking tool.<br>
<br>
On the one hand, yeah it&apos;s cool if a hybrid class can make use of their ability regardless of role. However some of our balance problems currently are caused by hybrids being able to do too many things to well with the same spec. If the tool is good for the role that&apos;s intended to use it, there&apos;s a good chance it&apos;s going to be too good for the other roles. That&apos;s why we often prop abilities up with spec-specific talents. One of the problems with the Holy paladin tree is it doesn&apos;t grant enough healing focus for investing in the tree. At the same time, paladins can heal very well so it&apos;s not as simple as just going into the deep tree and smearing a bunch of +healing effects on existing talents everywhere.

<br>

Lay on Hands<br>
We don&apos;t think &quot;Sure I can heal myself for 25,000+ health as a dps spec or 50,000+ health as a tank, but not very often,&quot; is balanced. Abilities can be unbalanced even if overall a character is not. This isn&apos;t a non-issue just because it doesn&apos;t affect Arenas. Also, it doesn&apos;t mean paladins are being singled out for one-vs-one duel balance (though I&apos;m sure I&apos;m going to be reading that for months to come).<br>
<br>
If we gave warriors (especially Prot warriors) an ability to cause 50,000 damage in one hit with no preparation on a 90-minute cooldown, most reasonable players would call that a balance problem. The long cooldown doesn&apos;t save it. Beyond some point you can&apos;t balance a very powerful ability just by increasing the cooldown.<br>
<br>
In general, we&apos;ve been moving away from long cooldowns anyway. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20677862444-blizzards-vision.html))</div></div>
