New Character Model Changes
Are the new models done?
Sorry about that, it's not intentional. We're still looking through and collecting feedback, and of course still have the Blood Elf update to go. We don't really consider anything in the game as "done", it's a constantly moving and changing and evolving game. In addition to going through stylistic feedback, there are a number of items that are simply bugs we'll be addressing, like facial feature options clearly not matching up most obvious being Undead eyes appearing where no eyes existed before.

If you have any threads/images/videos you think encapsulate your feedback particularly well, feel free to share them. Can never have too many links.


Blue Posts
Arthas Costume ChargesThe charges on the item appearing as 1 instead of 50 while on the vendor is due to a separate bug we're tracking. Many items throughout the game may be currently showing 1 charge, but when purchased will display their correct amount of charges remaining. It's a bug we're working to address but won't be within the Lich King costume fixes.

Any reason Ele has 0 mana regen whatsoever? Are they just intended to be horrible in WoD because there is really no reason.
Their damage spells have almost no cost. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522839978972176384

PvE
If I skip Tectus/Brackenspore and kill Mar'gok, can I go back and kill them, or will the raid "complete" with Mar'gok's death?
You can go back and kill them. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522761494120120322

According to patch note, each diff. should have its own lockout. But 10m & 25m Legacy raids are sharing them. Is this intended?
That's for Siege of Orgrimmar and Draenor raids. All other raids unaffected. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522846853671305216

Releasing in Siege or UBRS dodges a load screen. Will the old raids/instances see that too?
Draenor dungeons/raids will all work that way as well. We'll likely retrofit it to older instances in the future. WatcherDev https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522853610825064449

PvP
So honor not dropping from the rares and honor not coming from the isle of thunder quests intended or bug?
Intended. Those NPCs/quests served their purpose during Mists. The time has come to remove them. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522531702002831362

18 honor per win your joking right increase honor win cos 18 honor per win i wont even get full s15 on my hunter sort it!
Battlegrounds in Mists rewarded approximately 20 honor/minute for the winner. 18 for a fast skirmish win isn't far off. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522532392632741888
At level 100, you'll be getting that honor AND a box that might have a piece of gear you need. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522532530973470720

The new group finder is pretty awful for PvP... At least add 2v2, 3v3, 5v5, RBG categories?
When the season starts there will be arena and RBG categories. Pretty pointless to have them out of season. holinka https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522585831748300800
