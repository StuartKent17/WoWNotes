We now have a decent amount of information on Patch 4.2 and I can start building nice recap/previews, let's start with mounts!

PvP Mounts - Twilight Drake PvP Mounts
Gladiators get a brand new mount next season! As far as datamining goes the color of the new Vicious Gladiator's Twilight Drake  seems to be that one

PvP Mounts - Epic Wolf and Horse PvP Mounts
Two new awesome PvP mounts have been added, the Horde War Wolf  and the Alliance War Steed  are rewards of the Veteran of the Horde II  and Veteran of the Alliance II  achievements. There's also a couple of recolors but as far as I know only the first 2 pictures below are used. 


   

   


PvE Mounts - Fire Hawks
3 different Fire Hawks are currently in the game files but only 2 seem to be implemented/have a known drop location.



Corrupted Fire Hawk  Purple is used by Corrupted Egg of Millagazor , a reward of Glory of the Firelands Raider 
Pureblood Fire Hawk  Orange is used by Smoldering Egg of Millagazor , a rare drop from Ragnaros in the Firelands Raid. Doesn't seem to be heroic-only so far 
Green Fire Hawk  Green is used by Green Fire Hawk Mount  but doesn't seem to be implemented.

PvE Mount - Fire "Raven God" / Flametalon of Alysrazor
The Fire "Raven God" model is the Flametalon  mount from Flametalon of Alysrazor  The mount isn't listed as a loot from Alysrazor in the Encounter Journal for the moment but it's very likely that it will drop from this boss, let's just wait and see if there's an official confirmation in an upcoming PTR build.
