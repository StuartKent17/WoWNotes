Legion - System Requirements<br>
New system requirements were recently posted and we took a look at how they compare to the old ones. &lt;span title=&quot;to do laps around Dalaran&quot;&gt;If you are ready to upgrade&lt;/span&gt;, you can take a look at our latest Setup of the Month (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5472-Legion-Resto-Druid-Artifact-Intro-Achievement-Search-Tweets-Setup-of-the-Month) or ask for assistance on the Computer Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/290-Computer). <br>
<br>
Mac requirements are listed on the Legion (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-legion) and Warlords (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/300493) system requirement pages. Notable increases include the minimum CPU going from a Core2 Duo to i5-750, as well as the minimum (2GB to 4GB) and recommended (4GB to 8GB) RAM being increased. <br>

Is the 5.3 bickering between the Alliance PC and Vol&apos;jin canon? It seems OOC of Vol&apos;jin to threaten in the manner that he did.<br>
Definitely canon. And besides, Alliance players who called his bluff when he threatened could make him back down. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/697652193592102916))<br>

.I can repeat the Bodhi Pet Battle world quest over and over on same toon. Received rewards every time. Intended?? #LegionAlpha<br>
it&apos;s a bug, new tech not quite ready to unleash PB quests officially, but feel free to give feedback as you find them! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/697833959342764033))<br>

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br>
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br>
I still have not forgiven you for that article and never will! You slapped a lot of players in the face!<br>
I explained our intent that you coordinate with a team and don&apos;t just AE everything. I&apos;ve never quite understood that controversy (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694902946895495168))<br>
Maybe it was the title? I wanted to echo the surprise players likely after LK&apos;s dungeon zergs but maybe it sounded patronizing? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694903212499800065))<br>
<br>
I strongly disliked the logic that &quot;players can&apos;t do this&quot;. The drive to improve has steadily been quashed.<br>
For me games are about overcoming obstacles, whether it&apos;s Dark Souls, League or the Witness. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694904390960852992))<br>
I enjoy walking my dogs in the morning, but I&apos;m really not looking for a challenge there. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694904111964106752))<br>
I believe players *can* do something, but I think for many they maybe weren&apos;t looking for that in a game. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694903912403333120))<br>
But maybe some players want the equivalent of the dog walk, at least sometimes? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694904520187334656))<br>
