vodka (http://www.vodka-guild.com/) and Premonition (http://www.premo-guild.com/) killed the Eredar Twins on the US PTRs and got some new loot. It also looks like there was a 3rd kill (or a death touch by a GM) that dropped more items like Golden Bow of Quel&apos;thalas (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/goldenbowofquelthalas.jpg) and Stanchion of Primal Instinct (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/stanchionofprimalinstinct.jpg) but I can&apos;t directly link them to a kill, however according to the itemID they probably drop from this encounter too. <br>
