Warcraft Movie Box Office Numbers<br>
Warcraft has been released in many markets outside of the US and is doing well! <br>
<br>
<br>
Deadline (http://deadline.com/2016/05/warcraft-opening-weekend-international-box-office-1201763736/) is reporting that in 19 of the 20 markets it opened in, it was the #1 movie. <br>
<br>
In Germany, the movie had the biggest opening of the year so far, with 45% market share. <br>
In Russia, the movie had the second biggest opening, with 65% market share. <br>
<br>
Variety (http://variety.com/2016/film/news/box-office-warcraft-opens-international-1201784457/) is reporting that the Russian opening was only behind Deadpool this year, with the seventh biggest opening day of all time in Russia.<br>
In China (https://twitter.com/ChinaBoxOffice/status/735880884621049857), ticket pre-sales for the release night are already the sixth highest ranking movie of all time. <br>
Unfortunately the news isn&apos;t as great in the US, with an opening projection of only $25 million (http://variety.com/2016/film/news/box-office-warcraft-conjuring-now-you-see-me-1201783331/). <br>

Talent Changing Bug and Tome of the Tranquil Mind<br>
I would also like to point out that a Demon Hunter can&apos;t select a new talent while leveling without going back to town. Its like old school class trainers!!!<br>
This is a bug. You should always be able to select a talent if you have none currently chosen for a given row.<br>
<br>
In today&apos;s build, players may notice a new Inscription recipe for a single-player consumable, Tome of the Tranquil Mind (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/227043-tome-of-the-tranquil-mind), that can be consumed to allow an individual player to freely swap talents for a period of time. The materials needed to craft a Tome are vastly lower than those needed to craft the group-oriented Codex (formerly Wartome) of the Tranquil Mind (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/226248-codex-of-the-tranquil-mind), which remains as a solution for larger raid groups or guild banks that want to centralize the process, similar to the relationship between Feasts and individual food.

Legion Beta Disconnection Bug<br>
And this was suppose to be a build fix? It was better before this build.<br>
Yes, the build contains thousands of bug fixes. Unfortunately there is one new one that is causing the disconnects you guys are experiencing. We are working to have it resolved soon&#x2122; so you can stay in-game long enough to experience other new bugs and report them too!

Legion Minimum GCD<br>
This build does have a 750ms minimum GCD in all cases. This is something we&apos;re trying out provisionally to see how it works on beta.

Blood Death Knight Feedback -- Legion Beta Feedback<br>
The 20% healing was tested on alpha and it proved to be too low, why the hell change it back? So we have the most underwhelming active mitigation ever?<br>
The &apos;nerf&apos; to Death Strike was mostly a misnomer. Bone Shield is an absorb now, so counts towards Death Strike. It also effectively stacks additively with self-healing from other sources, which there are much more of now, such as from the artifact.
