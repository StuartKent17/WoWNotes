Boubouille2008-06-26, 09:17 AMOfficial site teaser/splash screen - Details
With the original news  reaching more than 1500 comments, I'll assume that a lot of people are interested in the teaser currently running on official sites, here is a little explanation for all of you who don't understand what's happening. 


 

The splash screen
This is the most obvious part of the teaser, a huge picture of a block of ice slowly cracking to reveal what seems to be a face. Each day a rune was added to the ice.
Day 1 - The first rune looks a lot like the one found on the Lich King swords in many official artworks. 
Day 2 - The 2nd rune is the Hel Rune from Diablo 2
Day 3 - The 3rd rune is the Protoss Symbol found on the Starcraft 2 official site 
Day 4 - The 4th rune hasn't been identified yet, and what looks like the eyes of the lich king appeared in the center of the ice crack. 




 

The "hidden" artwork
If you check the CSS File  of the page, you'll notice a few commented lines pointing to image links. 

/*.tundra {background:url_images/04.jpg no-repeat 0 0} */
/*.cold {background:url_images/16.jpg no-repeat 0 0} */
/*.cavern {background:url_images/15.jpg no-repeat 0 0} */
/*.icy {background:url_images/23.jpg no-repeat 0 0} */

There was a few theories about these pictures, people tried to replace the number of each pictures with letter to see if it would form "Diablo" in the end but it didn't work. Obviously there are many links between "icy", "tundra", "cavern", "cold", and Wrath of the Lich King / Diablo 2 and we can't confirm anything based on these names. 


 

Conclusion
Blizzard is having fun and posts a few things from each one of their game just to keep people interested and you'll just have to wait for the WWI to get the final answer. You've been waiting for Diablo 3 for years, it's not like 2 more days will kill you right ?
