I think most people that will play classic are currently not playing anymore. So &quot;retail&quot; will still have more or less the same population. Some -might- test out classic, but the game is too much work for most of current generation gamers i guess.</div></div><hr />

I think BFA is the worst expansion since WoD so guess what? I quit posting about it or reading any forum about it unless it was lore related since they do lore well. You guys just can’t resist clicking any classic post to shit on it. <br />

LOL. C'mon. You know that's not happening. You know the smug posts are coming, of HOW MUCH BETTER IT IS, etc. The two camps are too invested into it - one side will hate it no matter what, the other will never shut up about it. <br />

How can you tell a Classic WoW player is in the room?<br />

Don't worry, they'll bring it up, constantly. <br />

<br />
&quot;Current generation gamers&quot;. It's been 15 years, the adults enjoying the game back then are more adult today, not less, and changes in desires and what they enjoy more than likely stems from life changes and priorities becoming different. Doesn't change the fact that just as always, every kind of player is represented all the same. Some approach Classic with a chill mindset, others are literally min-maxing it to bits. And yes, a lot will play Classic and Retail. <br />
<br />
In fact, so many of the most aggressive fans tooting Classic seem to be far too young to a point where they couldn't possibly have played it whilst current. Either way, there won't be any 2004 gamers around in 2019, not unless someone's figured out time travel for people.<br />

Im more hyped for diablo 3s next season than I am for classic and im not at all hyped for d3. <br />

<br />

<br />
I blame the likes of Asmongold for their divisive rhetoric and constant banking on drama, literally dehumanizing Retail players to hype themselves and their preferred iteration up. <br />
<br />
It wasn't nearly as bad until a certain private server shut down, and then suddenly it was like American politics but with a gaming spin...<br />
Liking the game is easy, it's the people making shit obnoxious. Even in-game, the chats are more than flush with commenters doing nothing but hating on Retail. Holds true for Private servers, held true during Beta, will hold true for the released game.</div></div><hr />

Well, you’re entirely wrong about adult gamers. You must be quite young yourself, but old enough to not have gamer parents. So...maybe early 20’s?</div></div><hr />

The only one being wrong, would be yourself. Official word &gt; You.<br />
I am 33, and do not have gamer parents.<br />
