That's right. The active set of masteries is decided by the talent tree you put the most points in to.</div></div><hr />

Cool, I just said it because I have reasons to beleive it was directly imported from the Talent pages on the alpha itself as they are now, and considering it is information that might be innacurate in upcomming alpha builds, Blizz might have not wanted it to be public, hence the NDA. But if it's on wowhead, I'm guessing it's pretty final and the next build will be the beta itself with a lifted NDA</div></div><hr />

I don't think that's a bug, I think most of the shadow talents just weren't changed. I just glanced tho when comparing them to the list blizz gave, so I could be wrong. Should point out the names though instead of being so vague.<br />

I just glanced tho when comparing them to the list blizz gave, so I could be wrong. Should point out the names though instead of being so vague.<br />
<br />
Edit: May want to add a comment on the main page about including the browser with bugs, even though not all of them are browser related.<br />
OK, here's more detail on Shadow tree &quot;bugs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tier 1: Dark Thoughts missing completely. Currently displays the old Spirit Tap.<br />
Tier 2: Shadow Affinity threat reduction % doesn't jive with what appears on MMO-Champ front page.<br />
Tier 2: Shadow Focus should be Shadow Weaving, increasing shadow damage, not chance to hit.</div></div><hr />

Christ, way to look at the big picture. It's not like they can just straight out buff healing spells across the board by X% to make up for it. Oh wait, yes they can. And hey, these are obviously final, right? It's not like we're in one of the earliest stages of testing. <br />
<br />
I don't suppose you noticed that the improved shapeshifting thing that used to be ToL only is now BOTH, huh? You know, that ToL buff that wasn't listed in the ToL tooltip before, and still isn't?<br />
<br />
You just wanted to whine before even thinking about what really was changed, and what those changes mean.</div></div><hr />

This is what I have read and have taken from shaman q system now, and put it with what I know for cat.<br />
<br />
/UW-WF,FT-buffs given, 20%haste next 5 swings,20% fire damage for next fire attack<br />
<br />
/cast flame shock last for 18 sec<br />
<br />
/storm strike 8 sec cd, last for 20 sec on the target recast befor any nature damg if no debuff<br />
<br />
/cast LB if a 5 stack of msw, and UW debuff , and if flame shock is on the target<br />
<br />
/cast earth shock if ss debuff<br />
<br />
/UW for buffs use before lava burst and/or lava lash<br />
<br />
/cast lava lash if u have 5 stacks of searing totem debuff on the target: debuff stacks up to 5 LL does 20% more damg per stack<br />
<br />
/lightning bolt if u have a 5 stack of msw, SS debuff on the target and if lava burst is still on CD<br />
<br />
/use Fire nova if none of the above are off CD<br />
<br />
So it looks like this<br />
Flame shock debuff&gt;earth shock<br />
<br />
If ms5 and lava burst is off cd and UW buff is up: lava burst&gt;lightning bolt<br />
<br />
NO ss debuff on the target: storm strike&gt;lava lash<br />
<br />
SS is on CD no MS5, UW debuff is on the target and 5 stacks of shearing totem: Lava lash&gt;stromstrike<br />
<br />
Flame shock debuff is on the target no MS5 Earth shock&gt;flame Shock<br />
<br />
If MS5 lava brust is on CD and SS debuff is on the target Lighting bolt&gt;lava burst<br />
<br />
And for last use fire nova if all the above are not useable at the time<br />
<br />
Keep shearing totem down at all times<br />
<br />
Recast lighting shield when is low or off<br />
<br />
This is all of what I have taken in thru shaman Q&amp;A and meny more post<br />

The problem is that it force blizzard to do more work for Feral Tree. In the Feral Tree almost 80% is passive talents.<br />
<br />
If you look at it, i see that Blizzard added more talent for Feral so they can use Bear Talent and Kitty Talent without having some talent needed to go deeper into the talent.<br />
<br />
Bear Tanking: http://www.wowtal.com/#k=-5wwN9cvS7BIDEC.9dw.druid<br />
<br />
Kitty DPS: http://www.wowtal.com/#k=-AhZE9__Qqr_iaP.9dw.druid<br />
<br />
I see a huge differrent between the talents. The only thing that is common is SI, the rest is different when you look at it.<br />
<br />
I think blizzard should change SI for kitty as a way to boost DPS, whenever we corner a cat it will fight back harder than before.</div></div><hr />

In fact, the cookie-cutter spec is looking like we will have to take every talent in the shadow tree minus two points in our threat reduction to grab Inner Focus. I think Blizzard should make more shadow talents flavor talents and not raw dps upgrades to help mend how bloated it has become. I am very excited for the PI+Chakra Smite spec that I'm sure many will be testing once beta comes out. Seems like it will be good for automated spot heals while still maintaining decent damage output. I noticed the GCD reduction to Holy Nova that this smite spec would take for AoE as well.<br />
<br />
I don't like how a hybrid sub spec (smite) will have a proc and a damage CD (Surge of Light / PI ) and Shadow; the main damage spec will not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm going to assume its 25/50% because talents shouldn't get worse as you add more, right?<br />

I figured, because most classes have a great deal of passive talents. It would be an greater undertaking to do away with most of the talents than, while still balancing the gameplay compared to a whole new Azeroth. Maybe they realized they bit off more than they could chew and disregarded the &quot;doing away most passive talent points for &quot;fun&quot; talents&quot; plan.<br />
<br />
Just saying. If they do do away with most of it, i would applaud it. If they stick to a whole bunch of passive talent points, i am fine with it either way. We all have max level characters so it's not that big a deal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think this one would be better http://www.wowtal.com/#k=Zbmv2lnTIXePvY.9dw.rogue but its much too early to tell.<br />
<br />
Also I noticed a problem with the Feral Tree of the Druid Calc. Predatory Instincts initially says &quot;Increases the damage done by your melee critical strikes by 3%&quot; moving up to 7% when you put a 2nd point into it. However, when the 2nd point is placed the text then switches to &quot;While in Cat form increases your damage from melee critical strikes by 10%&quot;<br />
<br />
So is it still just a cat talent or one both tanks and cats can now use?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adl</div><div class="date">2010-06-10, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Three quick points:<br />
<br />
1) These talent trees aren't done. They're just far enough along that we're seeking feedback.<br />
<br />
2) Just to reiterate, we *are* looking for feedback on them. They are considered public information now and you are free to discuss them. While the rest of the alpha is still under NDA, we want feedback on the talent trees so that we have plenty of time to iterate on them. Just keep things in perspective. Nobody at this stage can predict with any accuracy that their dude is DOOMED in PvP or PvE based on these early designs. :)<br />
<br />
3) &quot;Passive talents&quot; is somewhat subjective. We are going to prune out what we can. Some players interpreted that to mean that every talent was going to be something game-changing like Chakra or Grace, but we think a talent tree of nothing but those would be quite overwhelming (not to mention making those cool talents feel less special). We still have talents like Improved Eviscerate, which are passive but more interesting than flat +damage talents . We still have talents like Malice because, frankly, everything else that can be modified in a low-level rogue already has a talent.<br />
<br />
We still think the Cataclysm talent trees will be a big improvement over the Lich King talent trees, and your feedback can help us get them there (not that it all has to be confined to this one thread of course).<br />
<br />
The only thing we ask is that you not let Cataclysm discussion completely take over the forums. There are millions of players playing the current live game and many of them will still want to discuss the current game instead of only looking to the future.<br />
<br />
4) Cataclysm will fix it.</div></div><hr />

1 point new ability talents (mutilate, preperation, shadowstep) get a streched tooltip, can't se the text for the talent at all.<br />
<br />
also when trying to refresh (F5 style) all the talent trees stack up on each other:<br />

Where are the spear tip talents we saw in tbc and wotlk? Talents like Slow, Shadowstep, Bladestorm, Water element, Beast Within, Chaos Bolt, Felguard etc etc.<br />
<br />
So far we have what, Earthquake(ele shamans), pwBarrier(disc), Pulverize(feral)? Did i forget something?<br />
<br />
I know the classes are given spells and abillitys beside the trees - but that was allso the case in tbc and wotlk (Icelance, Bloodlust, Incinerate, Mirror images, Savage Roar etc). <br />
<br />
Tldr; Spice up those talenttrees.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I understand that. However, what I'm saying is that Elemental Overload (Or anything that is similar to the current Lightning Overload) is not on the present talent tree.<br />
<br />
Therefore, it makes said talent useless. I'm assuming there's just a bug and Elemental Overload is just missing, or that as you said, it'll be the Mastery of the Elemental Tree.</div></div><hr />
