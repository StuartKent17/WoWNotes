Ressing in Arena<br />
Resurrections in arena is something that has been around since it was implemented. You have 10 seconds, excluding haste, to reach your target and interrupt or bring them into combat. If they are able to gain those precious few moments out of combat then I can only congratulate them on some very solid play. I recommend that you do your utmost to stay in range of your enemy and prevent them from casting their resurrection spell.

You get 2 free cans of soda a day. The watercooler is free. I don't remember coffee being 90 cents when I worked there, but maybe this is some kind of premium coffee.<br />

It all depends on how you look at it. The fewer benefits you get, the more you get paid (the money has to come from somewhere). I don't think 90 cents is too much for coffee, it probably helps pay for the employee who manages the food court.<br />
<br />
I worked at Microsoft, and I got free drinks, but we had to pay for food. I think I've heard Google pays for 1 lunch for their employees (in addition to lots of other things). I now work at a university, and well, use of the fridge is free (&quot;taxpayers&quot; can get kind of pissy if government employees get &quot;excessive&quot; benefits).</div></div><hr />

Do you people even have jobs? :rolleyes: And seriously, LOL at the idiot crying about rezzing in arena. Its a slap in your face that you are so bad you let it happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
lol, blizzard is even milking their employee's wallets.<br />
<br />
No, most likely it is whatever food company they contracted to provide food service in their caféteria.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apparently he does not, because that doesn't sound anything like Nightsong (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqTjHKGQL0I&amp;feature=related).<br />
<br />
I assumed you were using sarcasm to demonstrate that he ripped off music, but apparently you were sincere and wanted to preemptively clear up a future rumor that he might be ripping off Eric Whitacre.</div></div><hr />

Some of the best scores I have heard have come from WoW, from upbeat and heroic (Gnomeregan song) epitomising the Gnomes perfectly, to the song just performed now. JUst wish sometimes people would give the credit where it is due, and instead of whining about WoW, appreciate some of the things that get ignored all the time.</div></div><hr />
