General<br />
<br />
Honor is now purchasable from the Justice Commodities Vendor at 250 Honor per 375 Justice.<br />
Justice is now purchasable from the Honor Commodities Vendor at 250 Justice per 375 Honor. <br />
Conquest is now purchasable from the Valor vendor at 250 Conquest per 250 Valor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
<br />
The Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms will now identify which class role is currently the least represented in the queue, and offer them additional rewards for entering the Dungeon Finder queue and completing a random level-85 Heroic dungeon.<br />
<br />
The least represented class icon will show within the Dungeon Finder to indicate the role that is eligible to earn the bonus reward.<br />
Players must queue solo with the currently indicated least represented class (by the system) and complete the dungeon up to and including the final boss in order to be eligible for the bonus reward.<br />
The bonus reward will be displayed to eligible (system identified as least represented) classes within the UI.<br />
Once the dungeon is completed the eligible player will receive a goodie bag with various potential rewards including: gold, rare gems, non-combat pets, and (very rare) mounts.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Halls of Origination<br />
<br />
Temple Gardian Anhuur should now properly go into his Shield Phase at 33% even if he was channeling his 66% shield phase.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lost City of Tol'vir<br />
<br />
Soul Fragments that spawn during the High Prophet Barim encounter should now perform an emote when they merge with the Harbinger of Darkness.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wailing Caverns<br />
<br />
The maze section has been removed to make the overall dungeon more accessible and quicker to complete. Nearby creatures and bosses have been adjusted to compensate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guilds<br />
Guild Challenges<br />
<br />
Gold rewards are deposited into the guild bank once the guild reaches level 5. The text for the Cash Flow guild perk has been updated appropriately.<br />
<br />

<br />
New Cooking and Fishing Dailies have been added to Darnassus, Ironforge, Thunder Bluff, and Undercity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes: General<br />
<br />
Several persistent ground effects now display different visuals for hostile and friendly players. The following spells have the same visual effects for friendly players, but new alternate visuals for hostile players: Ring of Frost, Consecration, Desecration, Wild Mushroom, Flare, Ice Trap, Power Word: Barrier, Smoke Bomb, and Hand of Gul'dan. As a general rule, the alternate effects have a red tint or hue indicating they are created by an enemy player. There are currently some issues with this new change which are affecting several of these abilities and is not working as intended at this time.<br />

Hunter Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
Deterrence: The area damage of the paladin ability Hammer of the Righteous will no longer hit Hunters with Deterrence active.<br />

<br />
Paladin Bug Fixes<br />
<br />

Seal of Truth: Fixed a tooltip error that stated swings at targets with Censure fully stacked dealt 9% weapon damage. They actually dealt 15% damage and the tooltip has been updated accordingly.<br />
<br />
<br />

Moved Video and Sound to a new �Options� screen.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Visual Settings Updates<br />
<br />
Removed the red bar preventing the overall graphics slider from going to ultra based on computer specs.<br />
When the user moves the overall slider to a setting that would have previously been prevented, any option that can't go as high as that setting will get the warning icon with a tooltip explaining why it can't go higher. For example: The user sets the overall slider to Ultra and the water setting can only go to Fair. The water setting would automatically switch to Fair.<br />
Support for DirectX 11 can now be found in the Advanced tab of the Options screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At the login screen:<br />
<br />
Moved the &quot;Reset User Options&quot; button from the popup window that appears when you click Options to the actual Options window.<br />

Have to be dellusional if you think Conquest is harder to get than Valor point. <br />
Valor being much harder to get than Conquest, i dont see the problem in that conversion<br />

I agree. DI was a Very nice buff, to powerful definitely. <br />

Possibly because valor points are harder to get. As I understand it you can win 5 arena games regardless of rating to cap your CP. To cap your VP you have to kill quite a few raid bosses.</div></div><hr />

PvP vs PvE , who cares about point conversion, if i would PvP i woudnt mint that either... you must have skill for both and gear is not everything.

<br />
I have a feeling that is why they lowered the price to 75s. It makes it much easier to sell them on the AH. Right now, you really can´t sell green gems because if they don´t sell, you lose more than your profit the next time. in most cases it was just easier to vendor trash them.<br />
<br />
The justice to honor thing is kinda blah. It is the lower tier stuff, but it might be something to watch when 4.2 comes. Remember, JP is capped at 4000, so when 359 gear is purchaseable with JP, you would be able to buy 2 pieces. With this change, you could also save your honor, then convert it after you buy those two items, and buy another 1 or 2 items with the honortoJP currency.<br />
<br />

<br />
Except noone wants 99% of these gems anyway (lazy people for the daily, maybe some red gems for someone just beginning to gear up on their first character, and the price of inferno rubies being daunting) and as demand from blacksmithers &amp; engineers means the price of ore is unlikely to drop...<br />

<br />
I'd much rather PvE and get the gear I want for Arena then sit in CTF land with crappy players. It doesn't really matter how someone gets the gear anyway, it doesn't affect your gameplay does it? Not like they're handing out free epics, nope, they're handing out blue pvp gear for those who spend hours and hours in pve areas so they can PvP properly.<br />
<br />
I've been playing this game on and off since before release, and I can safely say, the Battlegrounds might be the worst thing about this game, they're just that bad.<br />
<br />
Bring on alternate ways to get to arena!</div></div><hr />

I mean I can understand that eventually they need to make &quot;starting&quot; PVP gear easier to acquire as the expansion goes on, so that new players/alts spend less time just getting destroyed. But this seems like too much, too soon. On the epic jewels; I'd expect them to be tied to the new daily hub for 4.2, or something similar.<br />
<br />
I'm liking the idea of bribing tanks (we all know 'least represented' is going to be tanks) to do randoms with chance of mounts and stuff. I wouldn't be surprised to see people complain an influx of badly geared, poor tanks post-patch though. Since a lot of lazy players that only play DPS might want those goodies too, but won't bother to gear or learn how to tank well. I'm sure there'll be players who might be surprised to find they enjoy tanking though.<br />
<br />
* - I'm not referring to all DPS as lazy or somehow incompetent if they don't tank. I'm talking about DPS who don't even gear or learn their main spec, let alone off-specs.</div></div><hr />

Because JP is really important right? Most people in this game will be using JPs to buy Maelstrom Crystals... I trade JPs for herbs. Considering you can level up doing Battlegrounds, it's only fair those people can use their Honor to get some gear when they hit 85. To the same extension, it's not really fun to PvP with 0 resil, when a mage can you kill you with a deep freeze. That will help people to get some starting gear and I approve...</div></div><hr />

It's got nothing to do with difficulty. It's long and tedious, especially for a starting instance. Do you really want new players to equate dungeons with tedious wandering around in caves? WC is one of the worst instances WoW has, both in design and execution. Compare modern Stockades to Wailing Caverns. They're light-years apart. WC could seriously do with trash and boss changes too. Especially bosses, who barely take longer to kill than trash mobs.</div></div><hr />

Because it takes me less than 25 minutes to get 2.4k Conquest Points and reach the weekly cap. Not only it takes a couple hours to cap Valor Points, but the cap is only 1250, half the amount of CP. If they allowed people to trade Conquest for Valor, that would mess up with progression and ultimately force all raiders to PvP in order to be competitive.</div></div><hr />

Yes cause playing half an hour with a mate equals finding 10 or 25 players to raid and all that comes with raiding (grind, repairs, etc., etc.). A tack-on to shouldn't ever be comparable with the main game that is PvE. People who PvE drive the economy of the server, pure PvPers (which will probably have most beef with this valor -&gt; conquest conversion) don't do squat at all but sit in arenas or bgs. <br />

That would be fine if there would be any effort in gaining conquest points, but there isn't. Anyway best gear will require a rating anyway so I don't know where the problem really is.<br />

<br />
Because they don't want the current tier of pve gear to be bought by pvpers?<br />
<br />
It's much easier to earn conquest than valor. They would have to seriously alter the ratio to make it fair at all. <br />
<br />
I don't mind the new system at all as its set up. Think that the ratio should probably be 2:1 to trade rather than the 1.5:1 but it's not a big deal either way. <br />
<br />
It's amazing how people seem to forget how generally useless JP is. Now you can buy bad pvp gear, and the qq can begin about more undergeared players ruining 'their' bgs.</div></div><hr />

It relates in this way, that you can go virtually /sit in arena for 25 minutes a week and get you conquests capped if your partners aren't half bad which you need one or two of. Or you could spend 3-4 entire evening raiding (3-6 hours) with 10 people and doing daily heroics each day to reach the cap at the end of the week.<br />
<br />
Now tell me, which requires more effort. <br />
<br />
So no changing conquest to valor = upside down sanity.<br />

<br />
<br />
When we can buy 359 gear with Justice Points, I will not care about 359 gear anymore and for all I care it could be a 100% drop from each boss in Ragefire Chasm or just from killing lizards around Orgrimmar. Exactly the same with Conquest Points - you will be able to buy stuff, but the high tier things will still require you to have a decent rating which not every scrub can achieve. Same goes for PvE scrubs, gear only goes so far.</div></div><hr />

For players like me who have little use for honor points or JP, I can actually grind BGs for honor and convert them to JPs to get mats or heirlooms. Moreover, for starting players it's even better as, one, Justice Points don't necessarily guarantee you the best gear as certain heroics can merit you better PvE gear (weapons in particular), and it should help ease players into heroics easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
lol that still has nothing to do with what i said. i never mentioned which required effort all i was responding to was the fact that the points would be limited to your valor cap if they were in fact implemented. <br />
<br />
not sure how that relates to what requires &quot;effort&quot; which if you really wanted to measure you should look at time spent playing divided by the amount of gear you can get with the rewards.<br />
<br />
eg.<br />
<br />
1 hour of pve raiding; let's say 5 bosses of farm content killed. that's 450 valor points and 30 pieces of potential gear divided among 25 players in the raid. so on average per raider that's roughly 1.5 pieces of loot earned per hour. <br />
<br />
1 hour of pvp arena; for a casual player this will probably take 5-10 games to earn their weekly cap. at the bare minimum you get 1343 points per week. that isn't enough to buy a single piece of gear. <br />
<br />
or you could go by weekly. <br />
<br />
1 week of pve raiding would be 12 bosses (not including baradin hold because it drops pvp and pve loot) which more than doubles the rate at which a pve player can accumulate gear to about 3 pieces a week. <br />
<br />
1 week of conquest points still nets you less than a single piece of gear. if you have a higher rating you might be able to get 1 per week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I think i misunderstood you and I'm sorry for that, it's 4:16 :). <br />
<br />
Well we're disenchanting 90% of the gear that drops from raids (10 player) and I'm still waiting for my loot to drop. So you can't just say - a raider gets x gear a week etc. There's times I don't see an item for weeks and yes there is times where I grab 5 items or more maybe even in one raid. The numbers might be higher on 25 player raids, but you're still not guaranteed a drop. <br />
<br />
Still capping Conquest compared to Valor is piece of cake, even if capping doesn't net you an item. And not everyone raids, that has to be said too.<br />
<br />
But since I misunderstood you, this has no point here anyway.</div></div><hr />

In the current system arena gear is too punishing to get for noobs, they have to win arena matches against teams potentially with pvp weapons and epic pvp gears.<br />
In the last season, noobs can simply lose 10 rounds and still get the points for them to gear up.<br />
<br />
I would prefer the skill&gt; gear idea, but some player would value the process of getting gear as an incentive, rather than the teamwork, rank in ladder or accomplishment around it. (Basically, E-peen)<br />
I wont say bullying pvp blues with pvp epic is fun, even if I am the bully.<br />

Several persistent ground effects now display different visuals for hostile and friendly players. The following spells have the same visual effects for friendly players, but new alternate visuals for hostile players: Ring of Frost, Consecration, Desecration, Wild Mushroom, Flare, Ice Trap, Power Word: Barrier, Smoke Bomb, and Hand of Gul'dan. As a general rule, the alternate effects have a red tint or hue indicating they are created by an enemy player. There are currently some issues with this new change which are affecting several of these abilities and is not working as intended at this time.<br />
<br />
They should change the visual of ice trap as a friendly as well, it just override the dangerous stuff from pve boss.</div></div><hr />

Was wondering what happened to that. <br />
<br />
I like that it's going to be implemented, but my one issue is the Valour Points to Conquest Points switch. At the moment, we have a cap for each week that prevents us from getting more Conquest Points than that, but if I read this change correctly, it sounds like you will be able to disregard that cap, as long as you have enough Valour Points to buy more than you can get capped. The problem with this is that if you wish to compete in PvP, raiding would then be a requirement to maximize your Conquest Points income, which I would not approve of, at all. The same problem could be said about PvE, since it would make doing Arena/rated BGs a requirement to get as much Valour Points as possible.<br />
<br />
Still, this is just my take on it and I could be wrong. Would help if Blizzard explained how exactly it's going to work.</div></div><hr />

You have to maintain Inquisition and SH. That means you build up 3 HP then you activate Inq. Build 3 HP activate the SH. Then if you did not get lucky with proccs you can't use a TV since Inq runs out around the time you get your 3 Stack of Holy Power again.<br />
<br />
So you'll only be able to effectively use TVs when you've got Hand of light proccs. And I don't need to be a theory crafting expert to make that out.<br />
<br />
For PvP that means that training the Ret is even further advertised. When you can force a self WoG it basically means that you just pealed the Ret for 12% of his damage.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, if you don't like the PvP/PvE points convert change and think that its ruins the game, then why not QUIT the game?<br />
I don't see the damn probleem in the first place. Honor/Justice points..is that a big deal? no one probably needs PvP/PvE gear from that and most people probably use the points for heirlooms or crafting mats. And why whine about Conquest/Valor points? So what if someone is able to get epic PvP gear? PvP is still about SKILL not about the fucking gear.<br />

That's freakin' stupid! Why do we have Justice, Honor, Valor, and Conquest points in the first place then if they are tradeable? <br />
Just make a general point system and whatever you do you get points and get rewarded for thing that you don't do. smart!<br />
Now, I actually agree with Justice to be able to convert with Honor and vise versa because...who cares? they are entry level stuff and helps gear up faster for whatever you wanna do. But Valor and Conquest?....no...just no.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, i forgot that every person in wow is 2800 and understands class balance so well.<br />
<br />
So your suggestion is to balance a class so that 0.5% of the game's population is satisfied while the rest can go /afk if there is no dispeller around. I am sorry but classes should (to the extend that can be done) be balanced in all aspects of the game equally and frost mages have been ridiculously OP for too much time in all other aspects of PvP but high end arena (as you suggest). It's the only class that can control an entire army of enemies and get out without a scratch. The problem is that facing a frost mage is annoying (especially as melee), in the same way of dieing 100-0% within a CS/KS sequence to rogues back in the day (it hurts when you can't do shit to counter something).<br />
<br />
I may not be 2800 material but that doesn't mean I should go /afk every time I face a mage unless there is a priest in my team. Sorry but I am sick of seeing people I know that they are just good in PvP reaching god status when playing a frost mage.</div></div><hr />

How difficult is it to remember which way to go... even if I've not been to the place in ages I still remember which is correct way, which way is longest and where there are short cuts... pity they are cutting it down though as some people just find it soooo hard &gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
And for the people who've never been there before at all? Its literally the 2nd instance horde players encounter. Sure I can find my way around NOW, but that's a) with the map and b) with the memory of being lost there many many times in the past, or missing the one serpent boss in the corner, or doubling back on ourselves. More often then not the group broke up before finding the room at the top with Verdanus. Or if they did find it there wasn't enough time left for people to do the escort quest for the murloc boss after.<br />
<br />
It was just too long and too disorienting a place for the 2nd dungeon of WoW. You still have BRD and LBRS if you like big sprawling dungeons.</div></div><hr />

Getting capped Conquest at low ratings is ridiculously easy, you need to win like 5 games - over a week you can do that purely by having opponents DC / be even more bad than you are. Lets not pretend getting Conq capped is hard.<br />
<br />
The problem with pvP currently is that the grind to get full PvP gear is disgusting - assembling a full PvP set takes FAR longer than a full pvE one, partly due to the hideously shocking BG queues and the bugged queuing algorithm. Horde on our BG we probably go 8 or 9 minutes between games. We have a roughly 50% win rate (so almost dead even) and let me tell you, getting a full set of pvp gear takes a looooong time</div></div><hr />

Why? It seems perfectly reasonable change since Word of Glory is has 20 second cooldown.<br />

No cooldown: 10 seconds to refresh if you want to keep it up.<br />

Also thank god for JP to honor change. Getting blue pvp gear is tedious and horrible grind with long queue times and bad players and when you have crafted 90k 1k resi gear its nog helping either.</div></div><hr />

People need to take their rose-colored glasses off for Wailing Caverns. I'm saying that as a person who has run more than 10 alts through that place with ease.<br />
<br />
That place suffers from the vanilla WoW version of Quake syndrome. In Quake where everything is a shade of brown, in WoW all dungeons were big dark holes in the ground and all of them being literal dungeon crawls due to pace.<br />
<br />
The best part? No more dealing with the mobs under the terrain that would pull you into combat and kill you from range unless you ran 600 yards away. I'm not sure if they ever fixed those. It was broken for at least 5 years.</div></div><hr />

It becomes mandatory, this will almost certainly be a dps increase to keep it up. So now we have Inquisition and Selfless Healer to keep up, ignoring the annoyance factor of that, since when has it been a good idea in this game for a dps to get better when they're healing?</div></div><hr />

You take less damage, but it also slows melee auto-attacks only by 20% (down from 25%) and it will not trigger FoF anymore so you get survivability for less damage and control.</div></div><hr />

I just sold the gems after the cut to the vendor. Why bother selling them on the AH when the price was close to the vendor and you probably wouldn't sell them anyway to begin with. The &quot;deposit&quot; cost on many items is just ridiculous.<br />

How fun is it to put something up with a deposit cost over several golds with a low chance of even selling it. It just ends up with people vendoring it or just spamming trade trying to sell it.</div></div><hr />

Seriously.<br />

<br />
SO what your saying is that because I chose to be Hardcore Endgame raider, I should be penalized now that I don't have the same amount of time to put into PVP and get similar/same quality PVP gear so that I can also have fun pvping. Because by your argument that is exactly what your saying. It's arrogant to let blizzard in the first place give players PVP gear that even resembles raid gear because NO, you really didn't have to sit with 10/25 people for 6 hours 3 times a week to get a CHANCE &lt;--- on raid gear week after week. All you have to do is do 10 games a week and you get gear, and with some rating even better gear. By no means in any comparison do you do as much work pvping as a pve'er for the same gear. <br />
<br />
If i were to total the amount of hours it took in a quality raiding guild last expansion to get full t10.5 heroic and all my weapons based on chance compared to someone who received better gear through PVP would be 1500:1 (1500 being PVE) (1 being PVP). <br />
<br />
So I fully support finally being able to acquire gear that is par/par with my raid gear that I busted my ass for so that I may enjoy both aspects of wow. If you are a pvper and have a problem with that, you really need to step back and consider what game it is your playing, and possibly consider guild wars to be better suited for your.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, that's exactly what should happen. If you don't have time to devout yourself to something, you don't deserve to be rewarded for it. It's the same reason people get upset when they hear that people running heroics are getting raid gear.</div></div><hr />

A fairly big nerf vs melee (not proccing fingers of frost when hit) and a small buff (-15% damage instead of +20% armor). And all you see is the small buff.<br />

&quot; Frost Armor has been reworked:<br />
It now reduces physical damage taken by 15%, instead of providing 20% additional armor.<br />
The Chilled proc from Frost Armor can no longer proc Fingers of Frost.<br />
The attack speed slow from the Chilled proc is now 20%, down from 25%, but it also affects ranged attack speed.<br />
&quot;<br />
Mage:Hunter can beat mage!! GC fix please! QQ<br />
GC: sure, wait a sec... i knew there was something wrong... i couldnt faceroll them<br />
***loading fixes***<br />
GC: fixed. Mages can now faceroll all classes again as intended and hit 2.5k rating with just 3 spells<br />
<br />
Hunter: GC! hunter is laughing stock of pvp for 90% of time since arena was created. Fix please<br />
GC: hunters are fine in bg's. L2p noob. Skilled players play frostmage<br />
<br />
It's actually a significant nerf to how often FoF procs versus melee (which all the other classes have been claiming is the real issue with frost mages), but hey, I suppose you're only able to read half of the change, so i shouldn't make fun of people with reading disabilities.</div></div><hr />

You can't deny that it's a face-roll to get decent pvp gear. Hell, every other bg I see at least one bot. Getting your base weekly cap for conquest points takes 30 minutes of 2's if you're not completely terrible at arena...shit just pay someone to carry you through some low rated games. There's nothing special about basic honor/conquest pvp gear.<br />
<br />
So if I'm devoting most of my time to raiding (something that takes considerably more time and dedication in terms of just getting gear), why shouldn't I be allowed to blow my excess points so I can come prepared to a bg? <br />
<br />
I was a t10.5 full heroic raider in Wrath. I also managed to work my way to a 2k rating for 3's in arena. I see no problem with the conversions.</div></div><hr />

Your not... I mean why can't they just make it optional to skip it, It's a classic place and it's a good thing you can get lost there it should have a meaning and be a freaking ''Challenge'' not just something like this - player 1: ''Ok, aggro on me we kill everything as fast as possible'' player 2: ''Wow this place is amazing... Never been here before i feel so excited, Exploring it is gonna be fun, hey there any story to this place?'' player 1 - ''Kicking him...''<br />

<br />
if you havent notice already, most of pve players already started to do arena to cap their conquest weekly, which means they already have epic pvp gears and it just a matter of time they will be having the same gear as you pvp players . what blizz did to protect pvp players is that pve players that suck in pvp cannot have access to gears that need min arena/bg rating requirement. you all are QQing coz u afraid pve players with full epic pvp gears like you will ruin your 2k + arena rating? (well if they do means they are versatile players and you just merely inferior compare to them, ntg to QQ about it). dont pvpers always say pvp is about skill not about gears?<br />
<br />
you should be happy that blizz makes this changes so that you wont get into bg with ppl bringing pve/green gears, and most pvp players already have no where to spend honor points, well unless you want to spend it on things like shards, dust, herbs etc which worth so little in AH compare to the time you spent in bgs, and you can trade honor to enjoy pve contents or herilooms to lvl up your alt toons.<br />
<br />
what i am trying to say is this whole convertion thingy will mostly benifits new lvl 85 ppl so that they wont have to ONLY grind bg or making low lvl pvp gears to help them getting a better pvp gears (trust me you will never want to see those kind of ppl in bg anyways). dedicated pve players will not beat you seasoned pvp players with just gears bought from valor or jp. if you grind jp for honor you will just get the rare piece, not epic. if you want to spend 3-4 hours, three times a week in raid for few weeks to get enough valor to buy epic pvp gears, go ahead, it just doesnt worth the effort. <br />
<br />
This changes will benifit many players and i dont think blizz will cancel it, and if you still QQing by all means apply for converting conquest to valor and i doubt those pvp guilds will raid anyway afterall why join a pvp guild if you want to raid?</div></div><hr />
