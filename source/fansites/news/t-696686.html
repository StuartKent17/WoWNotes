<br />
Update #7 - Added the new model of Mekkatorque and Vol'jin. <br />
Update #6 - Added a small info on the two new mounts, <br />
Update #5 - A few more details on the Ruby Sanctum from Zarhym (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23329393289-assault-on-the-ruby-sanctum.html)<br />
<br />
<br />
Gnomeregan will be recaptured before Cataclysm!<br />
A couple of very very very interesting achievements were added to the game files with this patch. I'm pretty sure it wasn't intentional but ...<br />
<br />
Gnomecoming King (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4786/) - You assisted High Tinker Mekkatorque and the Gnomeregan Exiles in the recapture of Gnomeregan's surface.<br />
Gnomecoming Queen (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4787/) - You assisted High Tinker Mekkatorque and the Gnomeregan Exiles in the recapture of Gnomeregan's surface.<br />
<br />
Apparently, parts of the pre-Cataclysm event have been deployed in this patch and retaking Gnomeregan will be part of it!<br />
<br />
Blizzard didn't forget about horde players, it looks like Trolls will play a big part in the pre-Cataclysm event for the Horde :<br />
<br />
New taxi nodes<br />
Durotar - ET - CC Prologue Troll Taxi Bat Start (#438)<br />
Durotar - ET - CC Prologue Troll Recruit End (#439)<br />
Durotar - ET - CC Prologue - Troll Battle End (#440)<br />
<br />
After going through the patch files I found a couple of extra spells that might be related to the event, see the spell comparison part of the new. Also, both Vol'jin and Mekkatorque had their appearance updated.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
New Models<br />
A few extra models have been added with this patch. <br />
Two new mounts, the Blazing Hippogryph (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74855/blazing-hippogryph/) and the Wooly White Rhino (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74918/wooly-white-rhino/). Important - For the moment, both mounts are TCG rewards but it could change in the future if we consider that UDE and Blizzard aren't working together anymore. We'll probably hear from the blues about that at some point.<br />
An updated model for Anduin Wrynn (http://www.wowwiki.com/Anduin_Wrynn), the son of Varian Wrynn!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Spell Comparison<br />
So far it looks like the patch notes were accurate and I couldn't notice any new class change when comparing spells tooltips. I won't list them another time just to avoid confusion, the patch notes are fine. <br />
<br />

<br />
Ruby Sanctum<br />
The new Ruby Sanctum raid instance IS NOT PART OF PATCH 3.3.3 but a beta version of the map and the loading screen are already here.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/rubysanctum_map_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/rubysanctum_map.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/rubysanctum_loadingscreen_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/rubysanctum_loadingscreen.jpg)<br />
<br />
Zarhym also posted a few more details on the instance and the loot you will find here.<br />
<br />
Number 2. The lieutenants are sub-bosses which will each drop an Emblem of Frost. Halion is the main boss. While the activation of Heroic difficulty is different from the Obsidian Sanctum, the overall raid format for the Ruby Sanctum is very comparable. <br />
You're likely to find some random pieces of armor on par with Lich King loot, similar to the items Onyxia dropped while Trial of the Crusader was the top-tier raid. You can also expect to see some more trinkets and things of that nature. <br />
This raid will not only provide a bit of additional content to pair with the current content of patch 3.3, it will be the beginning of an advancement in the storyline for Cataclysm. <br />
The plan is to have a normal mode and a heroic mode just like Icecrown Citadel, so far there is no plan for a Sartharion +1/+2/+3-like encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Interface - Auction House and Random Battlegrounds<br />
The Auction House interface has been improved and now let you auction stacks of the same item without having to use an addon. The Battleground Queue interface has been slightly modified to include the random battleground and call to arms bonuses.<br />
<br />
<br />

Patch 3.3.3: Frozo The Renowned<br />
I'm sure some of you noticed this in the 3.3.3 PTR patch notes:<br />
<br />
Frozo the Renowned has moved into the Dalaran Magus Commerce Exchange and will be trading your Frozen Orbs for various other trade goods.<br />
<br />
For those curious, here are the items for which you can trade your Frozen Orbs to Frozo. These each cost 1 Frozen Orb unless noted otherwise in parentheses:<br />
<br />
Crusader Orb (6)<br />
Runed Orb (4)<br />
Eternal Fire<br />
Eternal Earth<br />
Eternal Water<br />
Eternal Air<br />
Eternal Life<br />
Eternal Shadow<br />
Frost Lotus<br />
Pattern: Frosty Flying Carpet [Tailors Only] (6)<br />
<br />

Don't be silly, the Frost Lotus price is obviously a bug.</div></div><hr />

A profit is a profit. I'm sure there are people out there who will most definitely take time even for a measly 5g.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't think its worth it to buy frozen orbs. They are still insanely easy to get. This change will just drop the price of all the items on the list. The only way frozen orbs would have been elevated is if Primordial Saronite was on that list.</div></div><hr />

I mean yeah pots going for 10g and frost lotus' selling for 5g may be good for some people, but why would people even want to make them for such a low profit? Lol.<br />
I think this change is for the good of strong guilds who has their own alchemists burning off either a lot of time grinding or a lot of gold-spending on AH, to make the guild benefit from their efforts.<br />
<br />
And in my opinion, dirty AH-golddfarmers and their needs are far less important than making it easier for a good guild to share the fruit of their professions for a more reasonably amount of grinding. I mean, it's not like you can't get a lot of gold in other ways anyway, if that's your only goal anyway.</div></div><hr />

You spend 4 hours farming herbs (one of the most boring things ever) and maybe only get 6-10 frost lotus. you use 4 for your own, and make a little bit of profit. it's the same reason you pay for cut gems, and glyph. Other people spend their time to farm, and it needs to be worth it. I know i won't farm if i get 20g per frost lotus, and 15g per flask</div></div><hr />

We get to see the gnomes re-take Gnomeregan AND WE GET TO SEE IT IN PERSON AND ACTIVELY INFLUENCE THE EVENTS OF THE BATTLE INSTEAD OF SIMPLY READING ABOUT IT.<br />

having varian's son's balls finally drop is very interesting, makes sense after seeing him in SW for 5years and yet not aging lol, but that must mean he will be far more involved in cataclysm, maybe he will either be following in his fathers footsteps or holding his leash whenever garrosh walks into the room. interesting stuff indeed<br />
<br />
and the fact that we are reclaiming gnomer (FINALLY!) and apparently taking some area for the darkspear tribe, (where were they located again? i thought it was stv, knew it had something to do with murloc invasion.) is AWSOME!!!.</div></div><hr />

The fact that the new loot cards were put on Landro Longshot in Booty Bay not only tells us that they fully intend to print those sets (and likely future ones), but also . . .well, what the loots will be. And there you go: Blazing Hippogryph.<br />

If everyone needs then no one can ninja because there will be no special advantage. <br />
<br />
I would need on them when the time comes. I understand some realms the custom already is to need on them. <br />
<br />
I also hit need on the hilt and will continue to until I actually get one. After that I'll probably pass as I don't want to be greedy just selling them on the AH.</div></div><hr />

we used to run need/greed system for orbs too, but after 54th (number made up) instance fight over that if you need it or dont (which cant be proved by anything btw) we moved on to the need only system<br />
<br />
-that way you got same chance, can buy it on AH, sell it on AH, noone can really say a word<br />
-less instance time spent on ranting and fights &gt;&gt;&gt; small chance that that person really needs it so badly it would make significant improve that he cant acquire anywhere else</div></div><hr />

Maybe Thrall doesn't even need such an armor, because he is such a badass?<br />

Atleast it's better than the scraps of fur and wooden masks on his shoulders which he wore before. Lets hope they can all get further upgraded, however, I doubt Thrall will recieve anything new due to the fact he'll have new gear come Cataclysm.<br />

<br />
the lore guys have a several storys tucked away in the past which involved great friendships between small groups of chars, Thrall and Grom, Medivh, Llane Wrynn and Anduin Lothar and several others.<br />
<br />
we've never actaully seen a group like this portrayed in WoW beyond mostly just being told people are frends but coming in Cata we have Liam Greymane, Med'an and now also Anduin Wrynn all coming forward as young adults.<br />
<br />
its all very &quot;next generation...y&quot; which is kinda cheezy :P but i think it could really be kinda cool if we see them out and about and they bounch off each other as im thinking they might.<br />
<br />
<br />

Rather sounds like a quest-related cosmetic buff that changes your cloak to display Org/Gnome colors, without losing the stats from your actual cloak. Though the For Gnomeregan/the Darkspear buffs indicate the main event will be similar to the Battle for the Undercity anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
And it's about time Anduin got older. He does look a bit...disabled? in his face.<br />

Remember there is still that level underground before the actually instance, this and the surface are the places the could be recaptured and most likely expanded into a city size area whilst still having the instance there. With possibly some changes to it i don't know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I figure that there will be an above ground city but Gnomer will still be an instance as to not erase an instance from the game. Alliance will probably just be able to go downstairs and enter a portal and I imagine Horde will still have to take the teleporter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nobody does it. Ever. :)<br />
the Gnomeregan instance has been voted one of the worst instances in the game many times by players and there was a video interview a long time ago where some of the dungeon designers mentioned it as one of the instances they would like to redo.<br />
<br />
i suspect there might be still be an instanced part but i think the whole interior may well get redone to better fulfil the promise of the steampunk techno-city its supposed to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
two other things to think about:<br />
<br />
1. this could just be the 1st phase of more phases to come (so maybe its not just the surface...) <br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
2. both Gnomes and Goblins have transporter technologies so you might very well have &quot;portals&quot; in both Gnomeregan and the new Goblin city in Azshara.</div></div><hr />

don't think so. Alliance and Horde are both getting their event. Ally gets Gnomeregan horde gets the troll event. SO i think that both factions get a new city in cataclysm! can't wait. <br />

Well he is his father's (http://www.wowwiki.com/File:Varian_Wei.jpg) son, including the hairstyle... the hair color comes from his mother (http://www.wowwiki.com/File:TiffinWrynn.jpg).<br />
<br />
<br />
SO i think that both factions get a new city in cataclysm! can't wait. <br />
<br />
They may take back the area, but these won't become &quot;cities&quot;, at least not in the game meaning. It has been stated that even Goblins and Worgen won't get their own &quot;cities&quot;. So the Echo Isles will just be an &quot;extension&quot; of Sen'jin Village, a side-questhub to Razor Hill, like Gnomeregan Surface to Kharanos. Though, hopefully with flight paths.<br />
<br />
<br />
But seriously why do [Anduin's] eyes glow?<br />

I may remember it wrong, but he did show some interest in (arcane?) magic - or at least Jaina's boobs. So he may become an Adept of the Kirin Tor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes i like to complain...however if the &quot;reclaiming&quot; does go inside the instance as well i will be happy however i dont see this happening due to them not wanting to just waste an entire instance and in addition not wanting to make new players lose out on the possibility of doing the instance and also the fact that 2 major citys in one zone is pointless especially considering ironforge is easy to navigate and is closer to the zones entrances/ exits.</div></div><hr />

Or even better - Gnomeregan recapture as a raid-instance?<br />
<br />
Why are Anduin's eyes blue? It looks like the Lich King's eyes - Bad influence by Bolvar?</div></div><hr />

wut? That would be creepy. He is no older than 17 and shes probably in her 30s. If anything, Varian would be Jaina's new love romance. He needs another hot blond wife</div></div><hr />

Alliance and Horde are both getting their event. Ally gets Gnomeregan horde gets the troll event. SO i think that both factions get a new city in cataclysm! can't wait. <br />
<br />
And maybe we can get a caverns of time of the old gnomeregan instance :D<br />
<br />
<br />
No. And again, NO.<br />
<br />
It's bloody obvious what is happenening. Gnomes get top of Gnomer and Trolls get Echo Isles back for new 1-5 zones for the gnomes/trolls so they aren't shortchanged with the same areas as Dwarves/Orcs at least to start with.<br />
<br />
Again, they've said NO NEW CITIES. They repeatedly said it would just create more ghost towns like Silvermoon and Exodar.<br />
<br />
Again LET. IT. GO. They are going to be starter quest hubs, not cities.</div></div><hr />

I may be mistaken, but I'm fairly sure they have said &quot;no new sanctuary cities&quot; and not &quot;no new cities&quot;. Of-course this doesn't mean we will get new cities either. Gnomer would make a great city, the structure is already there at-least, but Sen'jin would need to be built pretty much from scratch... who knows.</div></div><hr />

Gnomeragons surface is reclaimed it doesnt say all of gnomer so I doubt brand spankin new cities will be released</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct, but this may be a gated event, like Quel'Danas, over time we may reclaim more of the city... all speculation ofcourse. Whatever it is, it will be awesome for the gnomes... but I personally doubt they'll reclaim the surface and just leave the rest of the city to the Troggs. Makes little sense. Makes more sense in a military push to reclaim a city, to work in stages.</div></div><hr />

First they make it so you can it easy to get Arctic Furs and now everybody has at least 2-3 bank bags full of Enchanting mats. Now frost Lotus are worthless and they are removing the CD on making the clothes (Spellweave, Moonshroud, Ebonweave). Dont worry Titansteel Bars are next. Maybe Blizz should reread there Terms of Use and see that they are affecting the &quot;essence&quot; of the game. I dont play WoW just to make gold but i dont hate it either.</div></div><hr />

Well, we can safely say that another patch = another wave of QQ. Mission accomplished. In what way do they destroy a profession when Frost Lotus prices were at 35 gold in Ulduar times and are now at a steady 70 gold due to a handful peeps controlling the market?<br />
<br />
Anyways..that is an example of my server and without even heavily playing the AH, just from questing, vendoring stuff and moderate selling of items I am sitting at 65k gold, epic flying on 6 chars and thing that most ppl just QQ for the sake of having something to QQ.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vangor</div><div class="date">2010-02-20, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was excited with the increase to the drop rate of Frost Lotus coming because I knew while lowering overall the amount of gold I will probably be making with an item with a greater supply also creating more lasting price competition on the AH I would be able to retain a few more flasks without cutting into profits nearly as much. Unfortunately, to make these purchasable with Frozen Orbs makes me want to shift to transmute and drop herbalism. My professions are not terribly competitive unless I am chugging flasks and elixirs, which is absurd in most situations and still ignores herbalism having no real value except for money.<br />
<br />
Now, I do not want to be doom and gloom about this since the markets fluctuate so much, but the only benefit of being an alch/herb was a reliable source of income. The change simply seems too extreme and players are going to overreact what with the influx of Frozen Orbs from what was gathered soon after the release of the random dungeon finder. They will not exist in the volumes everyone expects, but everyone will still expect the prices to remain so low.<br />
<br />
A couple Frozen Orbs for each of the materials would probably have been better to not cripple the price entirely and not raise the price of orbs absurdly.</div></div><hr />
