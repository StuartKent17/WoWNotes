New Specialization Screen<br />
As of the last Beta patch, new specialization screens were introduced that only show a limited amount of information for each specialization, rather than all of the spells you gain from it. See the New Specialization Screen blue post (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220352-new-specialization-screen/) for details!<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Red Pandaren Male Tail<br />
Though we've added red pandaren males, we intend the tail to be unique to female pandaren. We like it this way. We like the distinction. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220363-feedback-red-panda-male-tail/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3553420256?page=2#21))<br />
<br />
Additional Void Storage<br />
Sorry, but we don't have any current plans for extending void storage. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220468-another-void-storage-tab/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3553606406?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
New Specialization Screen<br />
We are going to show you all the spells you get (for each spec) in the spellbook. If you are a priest, you can compare the full Holy spellbook (meaning class + spec spells) to the full Disc and Shadow spellbook whenever you'd like.<br />
<br />
The problem we had with the previous specialization UI is that it was overwhelming with so many icons scrolling on to multiple pages, many of which you might not get until many levels later. You couldn't get a snapshot of what a given spec was about. It made what was supposed to be a fun choice at level 10 feel like homework as you had to analyze a dozen or more spells and then compare them to the other specs. Players' leveling experiences were grinding to a halt as they were asked to make this important decision based on tons of information that needed to be processed.<br />
<br />
We also found that we were making class design decisions solely to clean up the spec UI, which isn't a great reason to make design decisions. Furthermore, some of the core abilities (PW: Shield for Disc for example) weren't listed at all because they are class-wide spells not spec spells.<br />
<br />
By comparison think about how little information the game offers you when you pick a class for the first time. It doesn't tell you what ability warriors will get at level 60. Yet plenty of players still try out warriors and all other classes based on some hints and some assumptions about how the various classes will work.<br />
<br />
And if you really, really need to see all the available spells to make your decision, they will be there, but in the spellbook instead. In that situation you are going looking for the information rather than it being poured onto you.<br />
<br />
TLDR: The spec page is intended to be representational while the spellbook is informational. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220352-new-specialization-screen/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4366253797?page=1#8))<br />
<br />
Scarlet Monastery Gear Models<br />
We're going to look into this, as we feel that there are a lot of great items from the original Scarlet Monastery that we don't really want to remove from the Heroic version. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220469-things-worth-getting/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3553416800?page=1#6))<br />

Scaling issues<br />
All Monk attacks scale with weapon damage and AP, but tooltips won't list the weapon damage % or AP coefficient. Tooltips will just list the expected damage value. Behind the scenes, we account for your weapon DPS to determine the damage that your attacks will do, making it so that you can choose whatever weapon type you want (Dual Wield or 2-Hand, for example).<br />
<br />
That said, a number of attacks right now don't have proper scaling or damage values as the design of the abilities are still in flux. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220499-monkscaling-issues/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4427702904?page=1#3))<br />
<br />
Brewmaster feedback<br />
A couple of updates for you:<br />
<br />
Shuffle -- We're considering a test of removing the channel aspect of Shuffle. We think a channel mitigation ability is cool and different from other tanks, but it's problematic if Shuffle's short cooldown results in you spending all your time channeling it. That said, we might change our minds and make Shuffle a longer cooldown again.<br />
Mastery -- We're thinking about changing mastery to reduce the initial damage taken rather than the stagger periodic (again, if we keep the current design). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219841-monk-brewmaster-feedback-op-updated/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4254456892?page=20#386))<br />

[Monk] Chi spheres... some thoughts and ideas<br />
We're going to change it so that Chi Spheres are only viewable by the monk who summons them.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your feedback! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220494-monk-chi-spheres-some-thoughts-and-ideas/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4365753176?page=1#6))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest))<br />
The Amputation of Discipline<br />
&quot;Amputation&quot; is a strange word in this context. Is it the new gutted?<br />
<br />
I think you guys can tell what we're trying to do with Spirit Shell. We want Disc to have a spammable absorb that isn't as powerful as the instant Power Word: Shield. Spamming an instant absorb is just really hard to balance, which is why we have constantly had to nerf it over the years. We want a model where Disc can cast Spirit Shell often, and use PW: Shield for more critical cases... much like a Flash Heal. Currently on beta, Spirit Shell is lackluster because it's trying to fill the Heal role, but that's never going to be a really exciting role for a spell. We are going to try letting it fill the Greater Heal role instead. It should absorb for a lot, and if the absorb expires or is dispelled, then the heal will still kick in.<br />
<br />
We agree that Rapture was a cool mechanic for Discipline, and we'd like to add it back, but have it scale with Spirit, so that Disc priests don't neglect Spirit on their gear (or worse, get mad at us when priest gear that they share with Holy has Spirit on it).<br />
<br />
We have already changed PW:Barrier to have a mana cost similar to Divine Hymn. We want to lower the mana cost of Mass Dispel, but it is so potent with the new dispel model that it may require a cooldown to compensate. Mana costs as a whole are something we are going to continue to adjust. I said last week that we thought heal costs were in a good place, but then folks running through dungeons and raids told us they couldn't cast their big heals, so something isn't quite right. Remember the goal is for mana management to be more forgiving than it was in early Cataclysm, but not be irrelevant in later tiers. If it doesn't feel that way yet, then it is just because we still have more work to do.<br />
<br />
We still have some other changes to make. We're not happy with some of the priest talents yet, and the glyphs aren't finished. The glyph of Penance is pretty unappetizing. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220505-the-amputation-of-discipline/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4362520161?page=2#22))<br />

New Character Creation Screen Feedback<br />
As of the latest beta patch, the character creation screen has been updated. This update features a number of improvements including streamlined menus, gear set previews, and thumbnails representing each character customization option (skin color, face, hair style, hair color, etc).<br />
<br />
Given how much has changed, we'd like to get your feedback on what you like, what you don't like, and what elements of the new UI you feel could benefit from further tuning. Specifically, we'd love to hear your opinions on the following updates:<br />
<br />
The new gear preview. During the first step of the character creation process, we now display your character in a high-level armor set specific to the class you've selected. Your character will appear in its normal starting gear only after you've confirmed your race, class, and gender and moved to step two (appearance customization). <br />
The movement of class and race information from the selection menus to a new &quot;More Info&quot; button located on the bottom-left of the screen.<br />
The thumbnails for each character customization option. <br />
Please feel free to weigh in on other aspects of the UI, as well. Thank you in advance for your feedback! <br />

<br />
Female Cardinals are brown, and male Cardinals are red. Same species, look completely different.<br />
<br />
This fact applies to a lot of things in nature, especially birds. Yes, I understand this isn't as drastic as males not having a tail vs. females actually having the tail, but it's not out of the realistic realm of nature. Pick different things to be upset about.</div></div><hr />

I get the same urge too. There ought to be facial customization like some of the old races have. Getting stuck with the happy version of being stoned is just flat out wrong. It's worse than the female worgen incident, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I take it you've not tried the panda zone. It's a pretty environment, and is the way of the panda training.<br />

1. what is challenge mode? Is this soloable content?<br />
2. can someone please suggest they make a zoom mode for a close-up of faces on the character creation screen? Every other game has had this feature for years - i dont want a load of thumbnails, i want details.<br />
3. Still no invite<br />
<br />
1)Challenge mode that I can gather from, is similar to say, heroic timed dungeons, where gear didn't matter, - or that I assumed from the statement made back at blizzcon.<br />
Completion of the dungeon in bronze/silver/gold gave you x-reward.<br />
2) I've never had problems with the viewings, - increase rez for more pixel-graphics, or invest in a bigger screen<br />
3) It shallith come soon(tm)</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but we don't have any current plans for extending void storage. <br />
<br />
WHAT THE F DO YOU MEAN YOU HAVE NO PLANS!?!?!?!?!!!! Before void storage you did something, was as far back as burning crusade! So when will u do something about space issues, 2015!?!! God! Blizzard is goddamn frustrating...</div></div><hr />

I'm quite content with what we have now. We DON'T need another Worgen Female incident.<br />
<br />
Anyway, am I the only one that things the tail stub looks weird when it's not covered up by armor? &gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
We definitely don't need another Worgen Female incident. I guess I should have better elaborated by specifying that I want more actual facial customization options for the fempanda. What I have seen up to this point in the beta is disappointing, and can't help the small voice that says the designers are ping-ponging between one extreme and the other.<br />
<br />
And yes, that tail stub looks weird when the armor isn't covering it. &lt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dyrtnap</div><div class="date">2012-04-12, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well my gut was right. <br />
<br />
In yesterday's thread I was saying that I thought that the Monk set looked bad on Humans because it was designed with a rounder frame in mind. I was correct. What looked incredibly top heavy and silly on a Human frame looks very well proportioned and comfortable on the Rounder frame of the Pandaren. The downward curve of the shoulders is what screamed &quot;Meant for Panda's&quot; to me. It actually really looks like an incredibly cool set.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping that the gear issue is just a size scaling problem the art dept will fix before release. I get that they know most people will Roll Pandaren Monks due to the accelerated speed of leveling not to mention the newness but creating sets to &quot;fit&quot; them seems a little counter productive. That's like saying &quot;because the most played class in the game is Humans we should just make all &quot;fit&quot; them and say &quot;screw it&quot; it if other races looking ridiculous in them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What does gold have to do with filling void storage? I maintain only a few thousand on every character, then pool that together if needed and I filled my main's void storage weeks after it released. Deposits are free and I already had a ton of gear sitting in my bank. I have four full tiers and the rest are a bunch of cool drops.</div></div><hr />

You have free deposits? I have to pay 25g per item to deposit in void storage and 25g to withdraw</div></div><hr />

We like it this way. We like the distinction.&quot; Little things like this is what makes me hate the game more and more each day. It is not the big things but dozen of little things like this that add up and push me away from this game. They are suppose to be the same species so they should have the same features. How hard is that to do?<br />
<br />
Yea because look at those panda models..man they sure were lazy, the animations are choppy and awful with crap all facial expressions and horrible low poly...you know I can't even go on. Really? I mean really? You go on crying over amazing BRAND NEW models because they didn't add tails to the male? Distinctions between genders is not an uncommon thing.</div></div><hr />
