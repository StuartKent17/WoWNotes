We had a tier set with fins once before and almost no one liked it that time either. I do appreciate the fact that we have cool dimensional gloves and boots with stuff sticking off of them, but nothing about that set appeals to me. Also, the bear hat for druids looks more like a bear than the actual in-game bears do at this point, why. Also also, seconding what Utigarde said; please model and test things on something besides humans before you make them a thing in the game. I main tauren, and not only do at least half of the helms in the game look ridiculous on tauren, but the Thunderheart set - you know, the only real tauren-themed equipment in the entire game - has glaring issues with clipping with 75% of the horn options on both genders. Ugh, Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Also also part 2: Why another troll-themed set for shaman? Do a draenei set this time for god's sake, we're going to their home planet and everything, and I know from experience trying to transmog for a draenei shaman that it's really hard to find thematic armor.</div></div><hr />

i really like the more serious approach to the horrors of the dark. bring it on!<br />

monks have the same set for like 6th raid in row, paladins &amp; warriors are just plain lol, mages its like they dont even care anymore (same goes for their class mounts), warlocks are just robe and random head cover, hunters rehash of ToT, actually theres alot of rehashed themes from ToT, shammies for example. These look simply terrible, one of the worst tier looking sets ever, and this is the first time I ever commented on tier sets, so its not like Im simply bashing in order to bash, I like the game overall and currently enjoy raiding ToS, but this is a huge letdown on blizz's part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The priest shoulders looks like an overstuffed peacock. The rogue bandages clash way too hard with the shoulders, and I seriously don't like those shoulders (not at all rogue-like!). And I have no idea what the hell those tentacles on the mythic hunter is supposed to be. And is that demon hunter being choked by a demon hand as a shoulder set?

DH - People wanted this set gone because it looked like shit. It has been improved since, but it's just not that great. 6/10<br />
Druid - Class identity, great design, it's perfect. Best druid set imo. 10/10<br />
Hunter - Looks good to me, mythic only of course. The normal ones are shit. 7/10<br />
Mage - Would be a 10, but the typical oversized wow shoulders which nobody likes yet they keep releasing kill it. The helmet is a bit off too. 7/10<br />
Monk - Simple, yet great. As good looking as t20 was, it didn't look like a monk set, t21 does. 9/10<br />
Paladin - The mythic shoulders are ridiculous looking, the boots should be a lot smaller, but i hope they'll fix them. 6/10<br />
Priest - Doesn't look like it belongs in Warcraft to me, but it does look ok. 7/10<br />
Rogue - Robin Hood had a baby with Peter Pan, and thus rogue t21 came to be. It's clearly far from finished though. 5/10<br />
Shaman - They nailed the class identity, and i love anything troll related. 9/10<br />
Warlock - Mouth of Sauron or whatever that dude is called. Non mythic is trash, mythic is pretty good. 8/10<br />
Warrior - Much like the rogue, not finished. If i have to rate whatever the f that is. 0/10</div></div><hr />

Quite a lot good ones this time though.<br />
<br />
DK - Nothing new really, but why change something when it works 8/10<br />
DH - Obviously not all there yet, but to be honest looks more like a hunter mog than a DH 5/10<br />
Druid - This looks so good. Probably the best druid set in the game and there's some awesome ones in the past already 9/10<br />
Hunter - Never been fan of the lizard scale tiers, it's wip, needs something more and something different 4/10<br />
Mage - Looks okay, not the best but can't complain 6/10<br />
Monk - Monks do love them balls, but the hat crowns this set, pretty solid although missing things 7/10<br />
Paladin - Once again pull the long straw, like it absolutely 8/10<br />
Priest - Fucking god tier. Clear winner without a hint of doubt 10/10<br />
Rogue - Shafted, again. What the hell is this bard outfit. Assassins and pirates and outlaws and now we are supposed to be bards or robin hoods or what.. Was doing so well the last WoD tier and first Legion tier and now we're back to demolishing the sets. It's different yes, but sometimes different doesn't mean better. This is one of those times. The hat is nice although not fitting, but the rest needs some serious rework, worst shoulders ever. 3/10<br />
Shaman - Nice set for trolls once again, not a fan but shamans have been spoiled since TBC in every tier so I'll let this one go 5/10<br />
Warlock - Not my cup of tea, but I can see lot of the warlocks will be liking it. Rest is good but the helmet spoils it for me. 6/10<br />
Warrior - it's simple but i like it, at least the mythic version. The others could use some more work and flail. 7/10</div></div><hr />

Settle down, friend. There's complaining about how the armor looks, and then there's &quot;I'm going to stop raiding and/or stop playing over these designs&quot;. No one will make you wear them, I promise; that's what transmogs are for.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyhn</div><div class="date">2017-06-29, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see the same problem as usual with the &quot;armor types&quot;. Cloth looks like plate, leather looks like plate and mail like wood or plastic.<br />
<br />
· DK: Is there any chance blizzard release a blood-themed DK set? Please use the RED. All the pasts DK's sets look like frost/death. I'm talking about the alliance, of course the horde got the T20 red/blood colored last season of PvP. That looked impresive. The skulls of the shoulders look really bad, like a childish draw of a creature. Plate looks like plate.<br />
<br />
· DH: again with the armor type issue. Shoulders, gloves and boots are made in plate armor. There is no way those items are leather. Those spikes cannot be made in leather material... Overall dissapointing set, imho, BUT the style match a lot with the DH-themed lore.<br />
<br />
· Druid: the set looks like a cheap disguise of a bear. Restoration and Balance druids are probably very happy (irony mode on). Have you ever visited a &quot;Natura Selection Store&quot;? Meet the new T21 druid set. Also the kneepads are NOT leather-ish made.<br />
<br />
· Hunter: looks like a combination of various previus tiers, combining the murloc (T11) and the dragon (T2) sets. That being said, the only helm that looks &quot;ok&quot; is the mythic one. The LFR/normal/heroic helm looks like a leveling item. Again, let me say that using the chopped head of a creature in your own head is not a mail-material done, so: &quot;armor type issue&quot;.<br />
<br />
· Mage: I cannot explain how much I don't like this set. Non of the images looks good: LFR/normal/heroic/mythic are just garbage. Seing what the images show probably this set got a lot of animations of those wraps in your bracers/gloves, but don't like at all. And also the helm doesn't seems to be made in cloth. <br />
<br />
· Monk: I see a lot of changes from the different difficulties. But if I want to use a monk-themed tier, this T21 don't beat the T15 which is, for me, the best tier for monk right now. <br />
<br />
· Paladin: they have probably use the paladin's T13 as a template. Have you seen the heroic version of T21? It looks EXACTLY the same as a recolored version of T13... Come on, please... pity.<br />
<br />
· Priest: sorry, I don't know a lot of priest's tiers. Still dont like it visually and I cannot sense any lore themed version looking at T21. It looks more like a &quot;phoenix-angel-mage tier&quot;.<br />
<br />
· Rogue: probably the worst of all. Sorry rogues.<br />
<br />
· Shaman: again with the troll-themed tier. T15, hello again.<br />
<br />
· Warlock: the best set visually, as always, BUT again the armor looks a lot like chain/mail/plate and of course not cloth.<br />
<br />
· Warrior: don't like it. Looks like the class-hall set combined with the T6. Still we don't have the full picture of it, since the textures are not yet completed.</div></div><hr />

Still sad about the rogue one. It's not the ugliest ever, well.. Might be, but never forget 'man junk' helmet from ulduar tier. That's the ugliest thing ever.<br />
This hat is still decent, it's not rogue, but it's decent mog for the bard class coming in 2022. The shoulders are the ugliest ever, please fire whoever designed them.<br />
And the rest just needs some rework and less clunkyness, the bloody armguard looks like bulwark of azzinoth for a sleak rogue and definitely some other colors. The current heroic and lfr placeholder, vomit excessively. The normal color is hunter gear. Why are the arms wrapped in bandages? Is he really that bad as a swordsman. <br />
And that belt buckle.. Does the skull want a cookie? That's the saddest skull i've ever seen. It's like &quot;hey guys want to play? oh no.. it's cool then.&quot;.</div></div><hr />

We had scales already, back in WotLK, and it was hideous. Also the vanilla set with the dragon theme. I want mammalian horns, fur pelts, natural looking skulls (not like the weird aged ones like in Pandaria), maybe some small feathers tied on for accents. Heck, I'd settle for something with a necklace of fangs included. The shoulders on this are deeply impractical for a hunter, especially the mythic ones, and the helm, when you get down to it, is just a helmet, three versions of it with some spikes and one with a naga head on it. Why naga? We're going to Argus, not back to Vash'jir. I mean, even if they revisited the demon hunter set (the tier, not the class) it would be better and make more sense for the current content. But I'm not optimistic about ever having a hunter tier that looks like my idea of hunter-y, considering how boring and nonspecific the lodge is. I hate this xpac.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. I won't bother going into why I don't like this one, and why I really hate the lodge, because you probably don't care and this isn't the place for it anyway, but I feel like it says a lot that the lodge has a single stable master (and no mailbox, but that's a different problem), and my garrison has, on average, FOUR stable masters milling around. Not that I need that many at once, but y'know, it's a hunter-only NPC, they should be all over the place at the lodge. :(</div></div><hr />

People wanted that Naga xpac, now you get to hunt Naga in PVP all day, e'ery day! Seriously though, this set makes me laugh so hard. Think most of it is from the variation of mythic to the other difficulties. Like, LFR-heroic looks like a generic dungeon set with dragon scales/teeth/claws, and then you get to mythic and BOOM, Naga bitches!&quot;<br />
Rogue reminds me of Robin Hood. DH is pretty generic. Druid reminds me of a combo of WoD and WotLK. Monk just seems like a slight variation of their first tier ever. Death Knight is pretty generic, but it's a generic look done very well. After all the over abundance of skulls and &quot;rawr, I'm a zombie doods&quot; it's nice to see a subtler look that still looks nice. DK is probably my fave right now. Paladins, welcome back to Dragon Soul tier!</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, this set makes me laugh so hard. Think most of it is from the variation of mythic to the other difficulties. Like, LFR-heroic looks like a generic dungeon set with dragon scales/teeth/claws, and then you get to mythic and BOOM, Naga bitches!&quot;<br />
<br />
That's the kind of love Hunter tier has been getting for some time lol. Non-mythic tier having generic quest gear look and the mythic having some odd or slight variation. It's been sucking for a while. What is it with the relationship Blizzard has between Hunters and scales?<br />
<br />
<br />
What a surprise. Hunter has a god awful ugly fucking tier set. Such fucking bull shit.<br />

DK - Proper badass evil overlord look, with Red AND Blue versions<br />
Warlock - Simply Perfect fit for an evil caster, that Helm and detail<br />
Rogue - The Hat. Bloodborne as fuck<br />

Good Tier:<br />
Pally - It's a Paladin all right<br />
Shaman - Might look out of place on a non horde but otherwise solid<br />
Priest - Pretty shiny, and nice use of feathers<br />
Hunter - Should have been the Tomb set, but still great.<br />
<br />
Meh Tier:<br />
Druid - looks more like a hunter set, and overall unimpressive.<br />
Monk - Floaty orbs don't redeem the rest of it<br />
Mage - It's the headpiece.<br />

Of course it doesn't. People like you buy into anything you're sold by these Devs. If you took a second to actually look at the sets you'd realize most of them are reskins of old armour sets.<br />

The rogue gives me that blood borne vibe and I think that really fits in well with the theme of argus, though I do feel that the shoulders SHOULD be changed as they do not fit the rest of the that well. I love the dk set, love the design but also feel somewhat meh about it as it does feel a little too similar to tier 19 with the shoulders, which isn't that bad but kind of a bit lacking for me, but does look very nice for those who did not like tier 20(I personally did a lot). The demon hunter does look pretty cool and is definitely my favorite demon hunter set so far sense for me the past ones weren't that great in my opinion. The Druid looks very shaman but makes perfect sense for a guardian Druid and Druid in general. The hunter set I do like quite a bit, a big improvement from the murloc version though I don't think it fits with the tier too well. I don't care for the mage set. The priest set has too much going on in my opinion, though it does fit the all three specs in certain ways which is good but kind of bad which again a lot going on. That. Shaman. Set. That is really good, fits more the trolls but I can see the other races fitting it pretty well sense it's just a good set. That warlock set is spooky and that's really good, I really like the head piece with the mouth piece it has of some type of torturer of magic(affliction). The warrior set is pretty cool, though I feel the mythic set may be a little lack luster but at the same time I can understand sense you can't really do too much with the set. Over all prettt good tier in my opinion though some stuff feeling out of place, whether it'd be certain pieces of a set(s) or just a set itself</div></div><hr />

<br />
Death Knight - seems a bit warrior-like at times, but I suppose that isn't easy to avoid with plate not going the paladin route.<br />
Demon Hunter - seems really out of place, to me appears more like a Monk set.<br />
Druid - very much feeling like a Shaman set.<br />
Hunter - feels more melee orientated, and the Mythic feeling really off with the extra effects.<br />
Mage - pretty good I think, though slight Warlock tendencies with the collar.<br />
Monk - purple and green comes across a little Warlock-like maybe, but I think overall its a good fit.<br />
Paladin - LFR colours seem &quot;off&quot;, but I think it nails the look, even if feeling slightly unoriginal.<br />
Priest - feels a bit mage-like except for Mythic which goes all out. Don't think too many pull off that extra bling on the Mythic too well, but that really screams Priest, but in a good way.<br />
Rogue - don't like the shoulders, at least in the look of the set but overall I think that pulls off the best look, even if arguably too much Robin Hood.<br />
Shaman - seems to look too much like Plate, and not keen on the crystals.<br />
Warlock - feeling more like leather and plate, and really don't like the eyes. The mouth reveal could have worked better in my opinion with something other than those eyes.<br />
Warrior - Seems uninspired, sticking with a safe and established look.</div></div><hr />

Druid - a park ranger wearing Yogi bears pelt?<br />
Hunter - had we not have enough of tidehunter sets? Same for gronn stalker, come up with something new or just go with animal pelts, bones and skins.<br />
Mage - LGBT?<br />
Monk - sombraro es no problamo?<br />
Paladin - bottom heavy but alright.<br />
Priest - badass<br />
Rogue - oh hey Robinhood. Where did your bow go???and how did you come to give a shit about poor people now, being a rogue and all.<br />

Compared to most old sets I love this set rotation beside rogue. This won't come close to Tier 5 or 6 (that's why I am so glad Tier 20 is that again, I love Tier 6 with recolors), but for me those are on a level with Tier 10 for example.</div></div><hr />

No, but it doesn't look finished at all.</div></div><hr />

Only like 2 classes get unique sets and you people are hyping this up waaaay too much. These sets are not great.<br />
<br />
What old skins?<br />
<br />
Lot of them look brand new to me. Specifically the new Hunter set.</div></div><hr />

Thank god for transmog!! lol</div></div><hr />

People like you buy into anything you're sold by these Devs. If you took a second to actually look at the sets you'd realize most of them are reskins of old armour sets.<br />
<br />
Does that make sense or you want me to simplify it further?<br />
<br />
Jesus fucking Christ.<br />
<br />
And there are bitches like you that are always complaining. Wtf does &quot;reskins&quot; mean to you?? This are all new sets. You should stop complaining all the time, some of them are good, some are bad. That is why transmog was implemented. So I dont gotta read little 8 yo pieces of shit like you complaining about everything...want some symplicity? SHUT THE FUCK UP AND STOP COMPLAINING!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
on the other hand, paladin looks way too similar to tier 13. maybe other people notice other similarities?<br />
<br />
maybe this is why they're doing away with tier sets</div></div><hr />

As a hunter, with tons of shit looking set over the years, i must say i feel jealous. The hunter set is good this time (only the mythic ofc) priest and pala sets are gorgeous. As for the rogue set , well the problem with the hat is that it looks cool on humans but i doubt it will look great on other races :(</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martymark</div><div class="date">2017-11-27, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the classes's mythic ones look slightly more glowy, but the Hunter one is almost completely different while the 3 others look far more generic.<br />
<br />
I guess it's nice to know that Blizz was willing to really put in the work it took to make the non-Mythic hunter items look like trash.</div></div><hr />

The Warrior set seems underwhelming, especially after looking at that Warlock set. I hope we can get a lookalike somewhere for the other casters; that purple robe would be fantastic for Twilight Cult or Kirin Tor transmogs/RP. Just take off the other gubbinz and away you go.</div></div><hr />
