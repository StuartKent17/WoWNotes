Addons - Garrison Mission Management<br />
Master Plan (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/master-plan) doesn't work yet, but the author has indicated (http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/master-plan/tickets/550-addon-no-longer-works-in-6-2/) that he knows it is an issue! <br />
<br />
In the mean time, there are two other mission management addons that should help. Garrison Commander (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/garrisoncommander) is the more complex one. It has many of the features Master Plan had, but not all of them. It does have some extra features though! Garrison Mission Manager (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/garrison-mission-manager) is a simple addon that will allow you to optimize followers for individual missions. It appears to be compatible with both Master Plan and Garrison Commander.<br />

Hellfire Citadel Progress<br />
The first night of raiding is well underway and Wild Card (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/frostmourne/Wild+Card) is already 8/13 Heroic. If you can't wait for the full clear, the final cinematic was posted earlier today on a Chinese video site. There is no English audio, so for the best experience just wait another day or two for the full thing!<br />

<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
What was the thinking behind the decision to abandon class trainers? It cost time and money, sure, but it got people moving around<br />
It felt immersive, but at the cost of flying back to SW at every ding, messing with quest flow. Not sure what's best. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/610307067425861632))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Any reason to not have flying combat? Limit movement speed, have specific sets of abilities tailored to mounts?Nothing ----<br />
Nothing specific, though 3D combat is a challenge, hard to tell where enemies are coming from, see: Ogri'la/Vashj'ir (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/610159486406295553))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Anywho, can we get a confirmation if WoW's imps are like Diablo's homunculi as in they are created from flesh but are neither<br />
Imps are demons. Homunculi in Kara are demons with cool names. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/610323715478261760))<br />
<br />
Pets and Pet Battles<br />
yes, Kura/Eris account, Draenor Tamers account... 15 tiny terrors, 15 bags per char on PTR right now?<br />
Intended for now, potentially will be reduced to account-based in a future patch. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/609872809729224704))<br />
