US did get a head start tho, what's your point ? not only did US get a head start, but Method killed Ashvane before Limit did and if they were also ahead by 16hrs they would've got Za'qul and been on Azshara by now..that's a fact. Don't try and devalue that 16hrs advantage with your NA fanboy bullshit.<br />
<br />
Limit also got a head start on Jaina and still lost to Method....although keep in mind, Limit shouldn't lose because they are NA, they should lose because they sold out to RedBull and don't give a shit about the community. <br />
<br />
RedBull wants a monopoly on the World First race and Limit and the other guilds who sold out are supporting that. :)</div></div><hr />

Btw Eurochumps. Thanks for supporting American Capitalism using Twitch. Jeff Bezos is loving all that money.<br />
<br />
Its called capitalism kid method has sold out for years. Unlike the EU most people in NA have to work at least 40 hours a week and get maybe 2 weeks vacation. We dont get paid to go to college and have all that time on their hands. Thats why EU has somany top guilds. Method also has a huge advantage because now limit will have to bug test the fight. Its methods advantage to let limit get their first because Limit will have to change strats multiple times to deal with the patches.</div></div><hr />

What does Limit's taste like? I don't like Method one bit, but to try and play off an extra day as an irrelevancy is laughable. If it was the other way around then people would be crying non stop. Never mind though, US doesn't win with an advantage or not.</div></div><hr />

FYI, The EU is a lot bigger than just Scandinavia :) Although i Appreciate the kind words about how much better our country is than yours, as well as our players. Also Limit never gets fucked by having to &quot;bug test the fight&quot; thats usually the ruskis, who honestly would have gotten WF in Antorus if Blizzard hadn't royally fucked them in the ass.<br />

They is whoever decided that the first kill on an endboss is the World First regardless of time of availability. If NA for instance would get a difficulty tier a week before EU and would kill the boss in that time everybody would call for a change of the system why not in this case?</div></div><hr />

So who stops EU guilds from watching us streams for tactics and does eu then get the bosses with bugs not fixed until the same amount of time after us got fixes from open? There are advantages and disadvantages to both and whoever gets first gets first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look up all the American inventions from early 1800's. Most bright Europeans moved to America because the EU is run like a communist heavy regulated union.<br />
<br />
My healthcare bills are covered by my insurance. The Top 10 universities in the world have 7 from the U.S. I'm still waiting for you to afford your own military or do you like being America's bitch?.<br />
<br />
I know you make more than me in a week, your job is being a prostitute in the streets where your mother works at.<br />
<br />
No i am from Serbia and I don't keep money in suitcase like you,, I have couple of safe deposit boxes... <br />
<br />
I bet you are one of those American who think Franklin invented electricity. Google communism before you say something as stupid as that. <br />
<br />
So are mine, but the think is in my country everyone has Healthcare insurance and it's covered by the state, also it doesn't cost 100k for a simple surgery, 200$ to fix one teeth and so on. You do know America lost almost all wars, like Vietnam, Korea, Somalia... <br />

Read first part and for other thing you said, you are quite lucky you are in America because for other part your insurance wouldn't cover your hospital/medical bills.</div></div><hr />

Serbia is a great place to live in when you have the money. People that tell you otherwise all full of shit. I have friends that have moved out and are barely surviving outside, earning just enough to survive.</div></div><hr />

Why is there such a level of toxicity in a game which is not even competitive in the traditional sense? Or is it all NA vs EU bullshit?<br />
<br />
I don't get the &quot;not even competitive in the traditional sense&quot;-line, but yes, this is MMO-C (one of the most toxic places on the web as far as WoW goes) combined with NA vs EU and testosterone out the wazoo.</div></div><hr />

Enough to wipe hours of progression, there's also numerous stealth fixes. The &quot;Mythic beta test&quot; meme is totally valid. Final bosses are also heavy on front loaded mechanics, which means you need to spend hours developing the strats.

But still, there is no strat sharing between raid groups. Everyone has to do their own and the final boss usually takes up a major chunk of the whole World First race. If Azshara takes two more days Limit has the next advantage of a new ID. That are again 16 hours of trying with better gear. Last time on Jaina Method bet everything on the one strat because they needed to kill Jaina before Limit got the new ID. This will be no different this time. Method has the real pressure because they don't only compete against Limit they also compete against the ID reset.</div></div><hr />

Don't try and devalue that 16hrs advantage with your NA fanboy bullshit.<br />
<br />
Limit also got a head start on Jaina and still lost to Method....although keep in mind, Limit shouldn't lose because they are NA, they should lose because they sold out to RedBull and don't give a shit about the community. <br />
<br />
RedBull wants a monopoly on the World First race and Limit and the other guilds who sold out are supporting that. :)<br />
<br />
NA fanboy lol, I don't even like Limit, the only fanboys are the method ones as you just proved.<br />
The only way the US &quot;head start&quot; is a headstart, is if Limit clears the raid by Monday, you don't see US crying that Method gets to do the raid 12 hours after US can cause of the timezone and potentially kill the boss then do you?<br />
EU gets 5X more vacation time a year, but that doesn't help does it? no...that's just an excuse, much like your head start bullshit crying you do every tier, bla bla.<br />
<br />
You've also clearly never done any top world content, you're a sofa lfr raider.<br />
Limit having a headstart is a good thing for Method, do you know how many times a US guild has found bugs that make a boss impossible or hard to beat and then it gets fixed just in time for EU to roll in? US is the beta tester for every new raid it's a fact.<br />
<br />
You guys just cling on to the only thing the EU has left in this world, Method world first, once that's gone you'll sink back down to where all your countries currently are in the world stage, nothing.<br />
<br />
Yes Limit &quot;Sold out&quot; to redbull, and Method has sold out many times before that, do your research if you're going to fan boy so poorly<br />

I noticed you stopped and never mentioned World war I and II which were the only real wars of note, the others were just military conflicts. But what wars has your country won? oh wait, nevermind you just cry and wait for the US to help you.</div></div><hr />

Final boss sure but bdg has been streaming for multiple tiers and wcg was last tier. Having stuff like BDG's wall strat and BL's 3 healer strat can save a lot of pulls. Also there are a lot of fixes that usually aren't posted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's equal pressure. Limit has to go in blind and will often bump into bugs/tuning issues they don't even realise, the first pulls of Azshara had weird bugs with Hulk spawns. Meanwhile Method sat back and watched them develop the strats for Zu'qul and fix the phasing issues with the fight, then see heaps of pulls for Azshara to base their super late split gearing around. Gingi specifically talked about priest and shaman gearing while watching Limit's stream, while the rest of the raid did splits. Limit has locked in their current strat of hunters and warlocks, to counter the frankly stupid amounts of LOSing in Azshara (which may be due to a bad strat or poor tuning). Both sides have to gamble heavily but both sides have their advantages, if Limit wanted to be specifically cheeky they would develop shitty strats to throw off EU guilds so they can get that reset.<br />
The final bosses have heavy front loaded mechanics so there's a huge chunk of attempts put into working the first phase, then you have the intermissions which need new strats. Azshara actually looks like a horrible fight for progression and in general. First phase is stupidly unforgiving with the enrage mechanic on the split mobs, so wipe chances are high even before you touch the boss. Then you have the soul soak mechanics and the phases that haven't even really been touched yet. Unless the final phase is undertuned, I'm guessing the boss will survive until reset.</div></div><hr />

One thing I liked about the red bull stream was you saw EU and NA guilds being cool with each other. Looking at each other as just players of the same game. Cheered and shook hands on kills. Pulling in and talking to asian guilds as well from across the world. I used to think it was just an EU thing to go full toxic over the race but I am starting to get the perspective that really.. its Method fans that are that way. Everyone else wants to win but celebrates the race. Method seems to want to win and then piss on people weather it happens or not. It was a pretty disappointing discovery for me since they are the golden example of how this can expand into meaningful space.</div></div><hr />

Most of them stream regularly on twitch and apart from josh noone had an issue before so although plausible sounds as a punny excuse</div></div><hr />
