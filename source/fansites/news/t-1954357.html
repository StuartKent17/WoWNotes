Why are you doing this Blizzard? I thought the rogue community has asked for changes and _improvements_, NOT first introduce monks then bring in the DHs so leather has replacement classes and then<br />
deliver the final death blow to the rogue class bringing in obnoxious artifact (looking at you outlaw and sub) with shitty skins, bringing in &quot;class fantasy&quot; RtB gameplay like mentioned above that induce nothing but the gag reflex.<br />

<br />
No, they weren't.<br />
<br />
People were using 'em to get to areas that were open, but you couldn't get to them the intended ways due to a bug. Going to unfinished areas results in porting you out no matter how you get there (even if you sit in the ocean on a strider).<br />
<br />
Only place you can get to that you technically shouldn't is Broken Shore... you can run around there. But you can't do that on a strider I don't think - DH glides to beat the fatigue.</div></div><hr />

Like with flying, Blizzard have every right to remove water-walking mounts if they feel it takes away from the questing experience they are trying to craft. It's a shame, but ultimately the change is made to make the game MORE FUN for us.</div></div><hr />

The difference being water walking is a minor convenience that many classes have as a baseline to their class and you can even buy potions to walk on water. Flying totally circumvents game play by completely bypassing mechanics and obstacles. Huge difference.</div></div><hr />

Water Striders were changed to only work in Pandaria or DraenorI don't like this, but I understand why it was done; the entire expansion is a series of islands, full of stuff you could easily skip if you went across the water along shorelines. I used to do this on Thunder Isle. Besides, they may be adding a new mount like a raft or canoe that will serve the same purpose</div></div><hr />

It's a shame, but ultimately the change is made to make the game MORE FUN for us.<br />
<br />
Shoehorning us into certain tasks that are braindead the first time and downright painful the rest does not equate to FUN. If the content is engaging and fun FOR REAL, people won't skip it...unless the person is the kind that guns for max level and instances, and no matter how much the devs shoehorn those they won't change. <br />
<br />
However, it makes sense for them to not want waterwalking in content that's based A LOT around islands. People are currently and would abuse them come Live to get to areas they shouldn't be in and as we know by now, the devs HATE IT when we explore in our own ways...Shoehorned or go home!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well presumably they want DKs' and Shamans' water-walking abilities to mean something again.<br />
<br />
DKs and Shammies can water-walk at will as soon as the expansion drops. Other classes need to earn the right to water-walk in the Legion zones, probably by once again catching a thousand fish for Nat Pagle.</div></div><hr />

That's the point. This isn't a change that's going live in a few weeks, it's going to be for when Legion goes live. They won't want players to stay in the Warlords of Draenor garrison because it's the best way to make gold, they'll want them in the Class Order Halls and on the Broken Isles, doing Legion content. When the time comes, the garrison will become useless and we won't have any reason to go back there, the same way Sunsong Ranch became useless once Warlords of Draenor came out.</div></div><hr />

Which is the reason they took away flying before WoD hit, make the game seem longer than it really is.

That's not the issue, at least for me. The issue is that they're intending to take away something I worked for (die in flame wreath, Nat Pagle) to force me to work for the exact same thing in 'new' content.

Then remove the ability on Broken Isles not on Kalimdor or Northrend or Eastern Kingdoms... So according to you, you cannot use your strider to walk on water in 3 areas that has nothing to do with legion, because they dont want you to skip content in legion... makes sense.<br />

The Garrison fishing daily makes leveling fishing trivial. I mean heck, 15 points a day? Yes, please.<br />

And thats it. All of my multi-box leveling has just been made moot. They've just annihilated our uses for garrisons. This is ridiculous.<br />

I want more people to buy them so the token gold price goes back down. I expect it to by the time the game lets me buy more tokens.<br />

Much like flying, taking something away and giving it back later isn't content, not good content anyways. If they didn't want people getting around so easy via water strider, then they should have populated most areas with hostile fish. Besides, nerfing the these mounts is moot since we will more than likely be able to fly at some point in Legion anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At which point we then have people saying &quot;They should give everyone X because it's unfair that class A, B and C can. Suddenly everyone can make portals, battle rez, bloodlust and we're back to classes being too similar to each other.<br />
<br />
It seems a bit harsh to remove it from everywhere (Why not let them waterwalk in Outland? Northrend?) but I cna understand from the new areas.</div></div><hr />

You have to equip it, though. And if you get in combat, you can't switch it out.<br />
<br />
And really, the problem isn't so much that you won't be able to use the water striders' effect in Legion content as it is punishing level 20 - 60 characters.</div></div><hr />

You don't know what you're talking about then. This is gonna be muuuuch easier now to get gold.<br />
<br />
I could see it being harder if you have micromanaged your characters to make a complete gold-making machine, but otherwise, more garrison resources turns into mats (from the Trading Post, buying whatever is &quot;on sale&quot; or ore if nothing else good is) which you can sell for gold, or make into items to sell for gold. On a good day of garrison I can pull in several thousand just from selling mats over 4 decked out toons and a few recently leveled up ones.<br />
<br />
Also, remember this is for 7.0, so you have at least a few months more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then you're not very creative. Get a Trading Post, buy ore, leather, dust, whatever's cheap and sell it.<br />

It was so useful before the flying patch<br />
Inb4 Fel Water Strider in legion, a massive pain in the butt to get, like the Draenor one.<br />
<br />
The garrison gold nerfs were coming from a mile away, no surprises there.<br />
Though with this change you'll be able to generate a HUGE amount of WOD mats with trading posts. Imagine every alt having 15 extreme scavengers (because now you have 15 treasure hunters) and almost every mission on the table awards lots of garrison resources.<br />
<br />
I'm going to abandon the garrison in legion but this ensures that WOD mats will be worth peanuts on the AH. You'll be able to easily level professions to lvl 700, at almost no cost. Also, i might do the garrison for like first 2-3 weeks of Legion to craft all WOD crafted gear for transmog. Stages 1,2,3 etc - it will eat up lots of mats, and mats will come from the garrison.<br />
<br />
Anyone thinking about making gold with this in legion, think again. With your micromanged gold setups you will generate a MASSIVE number of garrison resources, up to 30.000+ a day (combined from all 11 characters). You'll SWIM in materials, and these materials need to be sold on the AH to players. Now imagine if lots of people do this... yep, there will be millions of mats on AH and the price will hit rock-bottom (vendor value).<br />
<br />
Herbs vendor for about 25 silver each, so you can get 6 silver per resource spent vendoring them<br />
Or you can purchase the money bags for 50 GR each (assuming they're still there) and get about 16g per bag, or 33 silver each GR (Lots of time lost doing it tho)<br />
<br />
Overall I expected them to just flat out nerf the gold by 90% (and TH trait too, to 10% incraesed gold) so it's not worth doing those. They went the other way, to completely remove gold and replace it with GR and totally different trait.</div></div><hr />

The change to water striders is simply retarded. Anyone who will want to run on water for exploiting purposes will still be able to, there isn't too much water in Legion to run across anyway, so it won't really make any big difference in that matter. They are making the game easier with every patch for the sake of convenience and then they go out of their way to inconvenience bunch of ppl. Only reason I can see for this is to cater to newbies so that they don't feel compelled to run obsolete content in order to obtain water walking mount.<br />
Btw, has anyone in the beta noticed the zones (at least the ones that are already accessible) are actually a lot more easier and pleasurable to navigate than Draenor zones?</div></div><hr />

The whole reason a lot of people did the grind to get that mount was it's uniqueness in looks AND the little bit of extra utility of being able to walk on water, which is what it was designed to do. Pond skaters In real life walk on water. It'll be like saying to us that we can't use horse mounts on anything else except grass as riding them on paths/roads is considered cheating and as soon as you touch a road you get dismounted.</div></div><hr />

Actually, it's worthless to sell it unless it sells at more than 2g per, AH commission included.<br />

<br />
Completely fine with the garrison changes. It would be extremely silly to have 20 inactive alts just log on to do garrisons even in Legion just for gold. Not only is it stupid design, it will heavily inflate the market -making things way more expensive-. Also, i think this is the kind of thing you should be able to see that, it will most likely get changed once a new expansion hits. Just look at the gold values on some of the easier raids that had insane yields, that was changed. I sympathize that it feels sucky to have levelled just for garrison gold but at the same time, maybe it's a lesson to consider if it is worth it next time if you see it's a case they might well change in the future (when it actually makes sense). It was not surprising at all if you considered that.</div></div><hr />

You need to remember this is for Expansion Patch and beyond. No one wants to go back to Garrison in Dreanor to farm gold in Legion.<br />
<br />
Well said.<br />
<br />
Anyone that complains about the Garrison gold nerf can pretty easily have their opinion on anything wow related discounted to zero as it implies a complete lack of understanding with the game and how expacs work ... and should work. And just to clarify, this isn't some terrible idea that blizz imposes on players ... this is a proper design decision that would be moronic not to implement.<br />
<br />
RIP intelligent posts :/<br />

Wut...? Isn't it sub-based now as well?<br />
<br />
He's referring to the fact that Garrisons award so much gold right now ... you can literally pay for your sub by doing gold missions and buying game time tokens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i did the grind *exclusively* because it was a long-term investment. the bait-and-switch isn't cool. at the bare minimum they have to have prior striders work everywhere pre-legion</div></div><hr />

1) It screws over lowbie characters.<br />
<br />
2) People worked for those mounts. And the azure version has been around since 5.0, so they're going to only nerf it now?<br />
<br />
3) It's terrible design to take something away just so the game devs can get away with re-adding it to the game under the pretense of &quot;new stuff!&quot; in the upcoming expansion.</div></div><hr />

1) I would argue that level 20-60 on an alt character is very few hours playtime and with the amount of dungeons done it doesn't change much but I haven't actually leveled an alt that benefited from water strider so I can't really argue that point.<br />
<br />
2) You still have the mount, even if it won't walk on water anymore. I agree that they should have done something earlier though.<br />
<br />
3) I will retract all my arguments and join the rage against this decision if they add another water strider grind for Legion that is required for a BiS mount. I really hope this means that the last line of defenders against the Burning Legion won't all be riding bugs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could see it being harder if you have micromanaged your characters to make a complete gold-making machine, but otherwise, more garrison resources turns into mats (from the Trading Post, buying whatever is &quot;on sale&quot; or ore if nothing else good is) which you can sell for gold, or make into items to sell for gold. On a good day of garrison I can pull in several thousand just from selling mats over 4 decked out toons and a few recently leveled up ones.<br />
<br />
The trouble with that is Draenor mats are going to be completely worthless in Legion. That said I'm fine with the change as I'm so sick of garrisons I hope to never set foot in mine again. I'm sure there will be a new way to make gold and honestly we were making way too much easy gold from garrisons. Hyperinflation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sadly a lot of people aren't mentally capable of thinking ahead. They read that a source of their gold income is going away and apply that to NOW, and not when it's relevant.</div></div><hr />

No one is &quot;forced&quot; to ride their 310 mount indeed. 310 speeds in Warlods are now slower than 280 was in Mists. Especially for Paladins and DKs.</div></div><hr />

Just because you &quot;worked for&quot; the mount doesnt mean its yours and they can actually delete it anytime. I agree though its lame tactics to nerf stuff you worked hard to get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The water strider change is overkill. Why not just prevent it from working in new zones? Honestly I mostly use it on levelling characters, out in the old world. Now that won't be possible, and that is annoying. I didn't do all those damn fishing dailies because I like fishing.</div></div><hr />

The change they actually made is exactly what you say you want. The RIP comment was editorial, not factually accurate.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ryuutora</div><div class="date">2016-02-25, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Much like flying, taking something away and giving it back later isn't content, not good content anyways. If they didn't want people getting around so easy via water strider, then they should have populated most areas with hostile fish. Besides, nerfing the these mounts is moot since we will more than likely be able to fly at some point in Legion anyways.<br />
<br />
I agree and they could've done the same with flying - add dangers to the zones that may prevent flight rather than removal. Same continent we had before, same enemies faced, and yet Fel Cannons are nowhere to be found. Draenor has anti-air weaponry that isn't even used. <br />
<br />
Pandaria had some big mofo's swimming around it's waters and we're right next to it + Vashj'ir to atleast create some dangerous shit. They want world to feel dangerous but they aren't making it dangerous by adding things, they're doing so by removing.<br />
<br />
Least they could do is make the mounts usable for every place except the Broken Isles, we don't need a repeat of area specific mounts like the seahorse from Vashj'ir - still such a waste.</div></div><hr />
