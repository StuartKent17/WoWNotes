The new petbattle-weekly is bad boring/bland reward and trivial/grindy task. It's another &quot;thing you need to do every week&quot;.<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Over catering to the &quot;casual&quot; is the reason for guild and friendship drops in WoW? From 1 - LFR = I don't socialize.<br />
Server identity eroded over time, which can hurt social experiences, but that started with transfers and faster leveling. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/638877217246674945))<br />

Blizzard announced Rexxar will be released tomorrow! They also announced (http://www.heroesnexus.com/news/1476-rexxar-tomorrow-new-reporting-options-dustin) reporting changes, a silence penalty, and some other new information. <br />
<br />
Going forward, you will be able to report players for Abusive Chat, Feeding, being AFK, Cheating, Inappropriate Names, and Spam. Players that are reported for Spam or Abusive Chat will be investigated and then silenced for 24 hours. The silence duration will double each time after that, with no cap. Get all of the details on Heroes Nexus (http://www.heroesnexus.com/news/1476-rexxar-tomorrow-new-reporting-options-dustin).<br />

<br />
no it started with the introduction of LFG and especially the concept of daily heroic quests which incentivized people to look for groups every day and spend little time creating them. Once you had that, you started to lose guild and server identity. Face it, if you were a healer or tank you could either wait around for a group in guild, try to create a group in trade... or queue and get one instantly. Of course you did the latter unless you consistently played with a group of friends.</div></div><hr />

Pros and cons to having such a system available, does more good than harm though imo, especially at this point in the game's life.<br />
<br />
Also I expect a lot of comments about how bland the dragonhawk is for the time it takes. Yeah, I suppose I'm in that camp too, though it's certainly appropriate for something reminiscent of TBC. The downvote ratio on that video is already about the same as when they do a new video for a store mount. At least the Wraithcharger is cool.</div></div><hr />

But you guys just want to complain that you are not forced to find groups because the truth of the matter is unless you are forced to find a group you are not going to choose to make friends on your server.

Of course you did the latter unless you consistently played with a group of friends.<br />
<br />
This old argument....<br />
<br />
I'm not sorry: given the choice between standing in a capitol city spamming trade as a DPS for an hour+ trying to get a group only to give up and play my tank/heals (even if I didn't want to) or clicking a button and being paired with folks, I will choose the latter. Every time.<br />
<br />
What everybody seems to forget about the &quot;glory days&quot; before LFD was this: they sucked. They sucked unless you were a tank or healer, and even then they sucked (because somebody would want to join, but only if their friend could come, so now what do you do, etc.)<br />
<br />
LFD and LFR were excellent additions to the game and people just need to get over it. Convenience tools haven't &quot;taken away&quot; from the community. The community itself has changed. Gaming has changed. It's been ten years--that's an eternity in tech, and an eternity in emerging cultures. What takes away from the community is people not caring about community. I've met people through LFD/LFR. My guild has picked up folks from other realms. It's great.<br />
<br />
Again, take the strawman arguments away and you're left with: the community has eroded because the community has changed. Incidentally, even in those &quot;glory days,&quot; people still sucked and acted like jerks--the only difference was you could then drop, go to trade and whine, and everybody in trade would wish you'd shut up because, surprise surprise, nobody cared. Complain to that person's GM? Get lip-service at best, &quot;lol u suk&quot; at worst.<br />
<br />
Love my guild, love that interaction, but also love LFD and LFR.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
There is nothing stopping you from making friends on your server and queuing up in a group of 2-5 to take advantage of the instant dungeon and have fun with a friend. If you do so you not only enjoy a quicker queue (dps going with a healer or tank friend) but you also get the advantage of knowing you will get 1 less unskilled or misbehaving player in your group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bisso</div><div class="date">2015-09-08, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Server identity wouldn't mean shit if they could make their game Region wide. When 95% of the server are dead, LFG or LFR isn't the problem, it's a fix to a 20th century technology limitation. When you need to pay $25 to transfer 1 character to a new server in hope to find new friends, you bet friendship and guilds die. Now imagine if the 2 million active players in the Americas would suddenly all end up on the same server, or at least, end up being able to guild up from where they are and the &quot;server concept&quot; would fade away.<br />
<br />
Of course they can't change that now, but it's dumb to accuse any ingame system of &quot;ruining the game&quot; when the game is simply showing age. All videos games now are doing a good job at breaking the barriers of servers, the whole concept of selecting a isolated place randomly and hoping to find people to become friend with has become near extinct today. Next MMOs would be wise to find a solution to there ridiculous limitations.</div></div><hr />

People expect too much, that is the problem.<br />
<br />
The game is an MMO, community (and effort to be a part of) is integral to everyday play. But it requires effort. You get back what you put in.<br />
<br />
The fact that effort is required to be a part of a community in WoW is a strength, and it adds value to the game when you're a part of a good group/guild of friends. The flipside is that yes WoW is a sad experience for the lone wolf.</div></div><hr />

The only reason i can think of as to why so many people confuse spamming trade chat looking for groups with good social interaction is that back in the day msn and yahoo messenger or whatever text based chat software were the pinnacle of online social interaction for many (pre)pubescent teens. Along the lines of &quot;Oh, i'm using the chat box to send my annoying messages to people all over the world, i'm being so social right now, what a great community&quot;...</div></div><hr />

This whole saga about how communities were a thing back before pug tools and how people cared about saving face on their servers so didn't misbehave is nothing but nostalgia driven drivel in many cases, I have seen people who never played before cataclysm hail the &quot;good old social days of wow&quot;...server communities having eroded due to server transfers and faster leveling however I can get behind, but I highly doubt anything g would change if those two elements were tampered with since the PLAYERS have changed as well over these 10 years.<br />
<br />
The people claiming that there's no community due to the lfd tool are right up there with the idiots claiming that the world is empty or the game is dead. You get as good as you give when it comes to being social, and I distinctly remember this being the case before lfd came to the game. Its simply not as easy as blaming one single thing for everything you personally feel is wrong with the game. <br />
<br />
I also remember back before lfd how some people would indeed whinge in trade chat about how some player being a ninja or douche, and people would tell him to stop complaining and join a guild. The ninja didn't change name or server and wasn't shunned based on feedback in trade but rather on what he did when in a respected guild. I have seen that happen several times since lfd came.<br />
<br />
People needing to be FORCED into social interaction in order to experience any in a fucking mmorpg, should NOT dictate conditions of said MMORPG. Same with flying, leveling, exploration...<br />
<br />
As for the Dragonhawk, sod that thing. The only dragonhawk color I dislike more than the Amani dragonhawk, happens to be that one. They could at least have used one of the new 200 mount dragonhawks with armor and done something nice with it.</div></div><hr />

This whole saga about how communities were a thing back before pug tools and how people cared about saving face on their servers so didn't misbehave is nothing but nostalgia driven drivel in many cases, I have seen people who never played before cataclysm hail the &quot;good old social days of wow&quot;...server communities having eroded due to server transfers and faster leveling however I can get behind, but I highly doubt anything g would change if those two elements were tampered with since the PLAYERS have changed as well over these 10 years.<br />
<br />
The people claiming that there's no community due to the lfd tool are right up there with the idiots claiming that the world is empty or the game is dead. You get as good as you give when it comes to being social, and I distinctly remember this being the case before lfd came to the game. Its simply not as easy as blaming one single thing for everything you personally feel is wrong with the game. <br />
<br />
I also remember back before lfd how some people would indeed whinge in trade chat about how some player being a ninja or douche, and people would tell him to stop complaining and join a guild. The ninja didn't change name or server and wasn't shunned based on feedback in trade but rather on what he did when in a respected guild. I have seen that happen several times since lfd came.<br />
<br />
People needing to be FORCED into social interaction in order to experience any in a fucking mmorpg, should NOT dictate conditions of said MMORPG. Same with flying, leveling, exploration...<br />
<br />
As for the Dragonhawk, sod that thing. The only dragonhawk color I dislike more than the Amani dragonhawk, happens to be that one. They could at least have used one of the new 200 mount dragonhawks with armor and done something nice with it.<br />
<br />
Errm no...back in those old days, if you were a ninja, or simply an idiot, your name just spread through the chat channels and no one invited you for anything anymore...Nowadays what? Ohh yes, you can`t be a ninja or at least much harder, but otherwise? Joining 4 unknown people in a simple run and with a good chance you won`t see them ever again in your life..So, many people using it to live out the real life frustration and be a dick (LFR is even better example) Of course in a way is the community which went into abysmal depths, but Blizz and the tools gave the road to hell....</div></div><hr />

Bullshit. The WoW community has always been and always will be shit. People that have actually played in the &quot;good old days&quot; will remember that there were exactly as many assholes back then as there are now. As if an asshole is going to be phased by some pixels naming and shaming his pixels in front of other pixels. I swear, with every year that passes by people find more and more made up bullshit to be nostalgic about.</div></div><hr />

They have the same system in FFXIV but nobody rages on their forums about it because their community isn't filled with as many elitists (note, I didn't say elite, I said elitist which is not the same) who are spending their lives trying to draw attention to just how red their butts are but unlike Baboons they don't actually get laid for having done so.</div></div><hr />

I'd honestly point it at Cross-realm zones. I remember meeting a ton of people both guildies and friends leveling up a character(s). Now I see someone its from realm I've never heard of.

Do you remember how the old WoW forums even looked like ? Because you obviously don't remember what they contained if you can say that trolling and flaming weren't big back then.

You have no idea about those times... People changed and cannot hold back the crap what Blizzard gave them. If a dish is good you eat it and not criticize it. I never saw a man who said that: &quot;Do you have a moment to speak about this shity pizza? I mean we have to discuss why we should put these into the trash.&quot; This game is shit and people have to do something and they can only write on forums, sadly we cannot fire people from the company.<br />
<br />
But the real sad thing is there are so much potential in this game ... old gods, bugs, titans, nagas, other planets, sunken worlds... and they just reskin the whole BC content...</div></div><hr />

(OccupyGStreet)&quot;<br />
<br />
no it started with the introduction of LFG and especially the concept of daily heroic quests which incentivized people to look for groups every day and spend little time creating them. Once you had that, you started to lose guild and server identity. Face it, if you were a healer or tank you could either wait around for a group in guild, try to create a group in trade... or queue and get one instantly. Of course you did the latter unless you consistently played with a group of friends.<br />
<br />
GC is correct, you are close. What also help this erosion was the when they cross-realmed the LFD, that hurt even more, because it took server Identity completely away. It also introduced a whole another problem that many had to start to experience. Every realms problems person, was now everyone's problem.This lead to a more toxic level of player over time, how Blizzard thought they were going to get away with doing the same in the LFR with even more people is beyond my understanding at this point. <br />
<br />
Cata had a big impact on the game the erosion of the guilds and realms had start in Wrath, but the escalated With the start of cross-realming zones and leveling guilds. Guilds were already losing their identity, leveling them made it worse, by having the focus move from people making the difference in which guild I would chose to going verses one that was level 25 with all the perks. Going a guild meant far more about what perks they had available, then the guild itself. <br />
<br />
Cross-realming increased over time to the point now, you do not really have to be on a realm to do most things, so now the demise of the integrity of the realms is almost completely gone. This started with the cross-realming of the LFD, but what took place in WoD finally slammed the door shut for both realms and guilds alike. Neither actually matter these days, when in Vanilla through early Wrath they meant everything to the game. Both were the life blood of what made the game, beyond the content a truly wonderful experience. Realms and guilds used to matter, they provided identity, cohesiveness, cooperation, self-policing, and many guild would hold events throughout the week or quarter to invoke a more collective type of atmosphere throughout the realms population. <br />
<br />
We simply don't have much of that anymore. I am sure it exist on some smaller level, but it used to be very wide spread from one realm to the next. The identity of both realms and guilds are why this game is now to the level of crap it find itself in today.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sorry: given the choice between standing in a capitol city spamming trade as a DPS for an hour+ trying to get a group only to give up and play my tank/heals (even if I didn't want to) or clicking a button and being paired with folks, I will choose the latter. Every time.<br />
<br />
What everybody seems to forget about the &quot;glory days&quot; before LFD was this: they sucked. They sucked unless you were a tank or healer, and even then they sucked (because somebody would want to join, but only if their friend could come, so now what do you do, etc.)...<br />

I didn't say LFG was an unqualified bad but it absolutely hurt server and guild cohesion. It also helped people get groups, esp people who played at weird hours. This might shock your tiny little brain but things can have both good and bad effects. LFG is one of those. If you had a hard time finding groups for 5 mans it was great. If not, all it did was hurt community. <br />
<br />
But really, it wasn't JUST LFG it was the addition of dailies. When heroics were just done for fun and some gear with friends it was one thing. But when you had dailies tied to them it became a thing to do every day if you could and then the increased ease of LFG made that even more compelling - and you ended up not running with your guild or your server because, why do that?<br />

Man, you know, I was reading until you said &quot;shock my tiny, little brain&quot; and you destroyed any credibility you had in your statement. (Thanks for dismissing the rest of my post as whining because you disagree, btw. That's mature!)<br />
<br />
But, pretending you didn't decide to be an Internet Tough Guy (tm) for a moment; I'll capitulate. Blaming anything but the community itself for making a &quot;bad community,&quot; is a logical fallacy and erroneous leap to make.<br />
<br />
The community got worse because the community got worse. Anything that made it &quot;easier&quot; or &quot;harder&quot; to &quot;get worse,&quot; is irrelevant. And this argument is rather silly anyway as exactly 0% of this is quantifiable. Whether LFD/LFR were introduced or not; whether CRZ, or anything else, were introduced, the community could have stayed positive, or could have gotten more negative and disconnected. It speaks to the community, not the game design, that people don't put a little extra effort into the SOCIAL aspect of the game when they aren't required to. Which kinda indicates that the social element would have been forced/a sham anyway, no?<br />
<br />
It's like the real world. You'll meet people you like and people you dislike doing anything that involves other people. I can stay home every night and not meet people and get through life just fine. And that's fine, if I'm content with that! Or, if I feel the desire to meet new people, I can go seek them.</div></div><hr />

I am usually defending and not ciricising Blizzard but they have updated graphics in game and it feels like step back to old Wow to put new old thing in. It wouldn't have been frustrating in BC or in Wotlk but now as we get amazing mount models the question remains: who will even want to ride that old dragonhawk? I have one dragonhawk (different color) and never use it besides the initial use after I received it. They could just try a bit more and update this model even if a little. <br />
When it comes to flying I still don't have it and don't plan on farming for it. It is not that much, probably a week of solid chores but motivation is not there as all I think of is new expansion. Know many people here were excited for flying but I doubt that game became super interesting now because they can fly to their dailies instead of using a wing thing (really like gliders) or fp.</div></div><hr />

I love the game dont get me wrong but things like this just says &quot;we dont care&quot; too the community .<br />
FFs put some armour on it or some firehawk flames or something , anything really .<br />
Blizzard design team 0/10 for effort !</div></div><hr />

I think most people would have been happy if it had uptodateTextures at least. This looks straight from TBC, so old and outdated compared to current mounts and even the new Charger.</div></div><hr />
