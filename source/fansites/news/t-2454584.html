The Horde and Alliance have established their footholds in Kul Tiras and Zandalar, each seeking to use these staging points as inroads to the flow of Azerite in enemy territory. Now the Horde and the Alliance will use those hard-earned footholds to launch large-scale assaults deep into enemy territory. While the assaulting faction tries to break through their enemy’s defenses, players must rally the local forces to drive the invaders from their continent.<br />
<br />
Who: Level 110 and Above players who have unlocked World Quests on their account and have begun the War Campaign.<br />
<br />
Where: Kul Tiras and Zandalar<br />
<br />
With the release of Tides of Vengeance, players will be able to take part in Faction Assaults in Zandalar and Kul Tiras. Level 110 and above players from the Horde and the Alliance will be able to take part in these events on either continent as long as they have unlocked World Quests on their account and have begun the War Campaign.<br />
<br />
Faction Assaults will cycle regularly between Kul Tiras and Zandalar, giving players an opportunity to either help their faction attack or defend via a series of World Quests. Much like Legion Assaults, players will be able to see when a Faction Assault is occurring by pulling up their world map (M). A Horde or Alliance crest on the map will indicate the type of invasion that is occurring and the available quests associated with it.<br />
<br />

<br />
Players will be able to take part in a variety of quest types, including taking out elite targets, mowing down enemy armies with powerful magic and siege weapons, taking down the enemy ship, participating in covert assassinations, or embarking on shared quests that bring the two opposing factions in close proximity to each other. For those who have War Mode on, you’ll want to stay on your toes—and maybe grab a friend or two to join you in battle. <br />
<br />
Whether you’re participating in PvP or not, you’ll want to keep your eyes out for a variety of additional bonus items such as potions and bombs to aid you in your quest to push out the opposing forces. A little help from something like an Unstable Azerite Flare could turn the tides of battle quickly—if you can hang on to it long enough.<br />
<br />
The Spoils of War<br />
If you’re working on leveling an alternate character (or two), Faction Assaults provide plenty of opportunities to earn experience and reputation with the 7th Legion or Honorbound. Completing a Faction Assault will also provide a 1-hour experience buff to help you as you level your way through Battle for Azeroth and prepare to bring your full might to your faction’s aid.<br />
<br />
Players at maximum level will be able to earn bonus reputation, War Resources, and new gear (item level 325–370) with a chance of being Titanforged. There are also many achievements to be earned both in PvE and in War Mode.<br />
<br />
Timing is Everything<br />
Faction Assaults will only be available for a set period of time before they are gone—at least until the next one. You’ll want to keep an eye on the Faction Assault timer, which is visible on your world map and will appear as a countdown in any quests you’re participating in as time winds down. Once an event has completed, any quests you’re on will be gone with it. You’ll want to be extra careful if you’re assaulting a ship hovering over the battlefield . . . you might suddenly find the only direction you can go is down.<br />
<br />
Bring some friends along for the fun—and maybe for a little extra protection. Faction Assaults are bound to get your blood pumping.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the other hand, with XP changes, 8.1 will be great time to level Allied Races up to 90 (when bonus objectives -&gt; invasions -&gt; incursions will take them off to cap - to be honest it's kinda sad that best WoW levelling experience can be skipped very easiliy, if only invasions would be 60-90 instead of 90-120...).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would I? Legion, TBC, Wotlk and MoP to a degree were all fantastic. As others have said there is nothing compelling about 120 gameplay at the moment.<br />
<br />
Azerite armor? Boring and stale. Mythic+? Boring and stale. Raiding? Boring and stale. Class design? Boring and stale. More world quests sold as a &quot;war&quot;? Boring and stale.<br />
<br />
Blizzard will regret not including Tier gear in this expansion. Will be back before long.<br />
<br />
I won't unsub because I enjoy playing on my low level twinks, but every expansion they've made without an arch-enemy to focus on has been poor thus far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is, but it is very much an after thought of the expansion so far. BfA starts out with you talking to Magni and getting the Heart of Azeroth and then saying you're her champion. There are very few quests while leveling that has anything relevant about it and at end game only the Champions of Azeroth emissary has you involved with Magni at all. It may change as the expansion goes on but right now it's not front and center at all. It's all about helping Kul Tiras/Zandalar to get them to join you. The next patch amps up the war but from what I've seen in previews there's nothing more about Azerite added, but i could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The experience they give is much lower than the experience Legion invasions used to give and in addition to this, if starting the war campaign means getting access to Kul Tiras as Horde or Zandalar as Alliance, it means you first have to do the quest to collect 100 war resources. In other words, you've got to do this tedious chore of getting 100 war resources and can't just jump right into the incursions on a 110 that just arrived in Zandalar/Kul Tiras. <br />
<br />
I hope we won't have to do the 100 war resource quest, otherwise incursions will not only not be a good way to level, but they'll also be slowing us down when it comes to leveling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Meanwhile, class design remain rather boring for most classes and the ridiculous mission table on our tiny faction boat, isnt exactly an improvement, either. You complained about WoD as the worst possible expansion, while its only real issue was cut content and some small pruning(in comparission to BfA). At least WoD had PvP vendors, the much hated ashran, pvp scaling that did make sense with more fluid to play specs, like shadow priest with orbs and no annoying voidform mechanic. If you did some pvp it was rather good, tbh. People hated garrissions, but at least they got meaningful missions to do. Have a hard look on BfAs mission table. I suggest to. remove it by now, its a waste of resources!</div></div><hr />

I call bollocks on this statement, there is no way you get to max level from just the quests in a single zone. Stop trying to BS. It takes at least 2 of the 3 available zones to get to 120 if you do nothing but the quests.</div></div><hr />

I would love to know how you could level to 119 while only doing quests in one zone. Also, the point of doing Legion Invasions on an alt was to level from only doing its world quests. Blizzard is yet again telling players they're doing it wrong by moving most of the potential exp from the actual reward to a buff, so that you are strongly &quot;encouraged&quot; to do regular quests in order to get the most benefit.<br />
<br />
The lack of account-wide reputation tokens is an issue despite your assertion to the contrary. Do you have profession alts (bonus points if both player factions)? Are you going to be pursuing paragon rewards? If yes to any and you did all that during Legion, I can guarantee an altoholic is going to be feeling the difference with Faction Assaults. And that is on top of what's already live in the form of the awful BfA mission rewards.</div></div><hr />
