Dual Talent Spec and Glyphs<br />
Well we agree that swapping talent specs isn't quite enough. No use having a whole load of glyphs for your tanking spec that are almost useless when you're dealing damage, for example. We'd also like to swap over action bars too -- it'd be a pain if you're trying to Mind Flay and you end up trying to Flash Heal!<br />
<br />
So yes we have taken these kind of considerations into account and we'd like the feature to do more than &quot;just&quot; swap talent specs.<br />
<br />
Because it is a bit more featured than originally mentioned, we'll be needing to do a bit more work on it before we can share it with you. So we're hoping to bring this feature to you in our next major content patch, but only if we're happy enough with it to make it live. <br />

It's not as easy as everyone thinks. We need to use 6 snowfall ink's and you get basically average 1-2 every stack of 20 herbs when milled. It takes 2 rare pigments to make an ink and you need 6 of them per card. So, milling about 6 stacks of herbs and they cost about 35g/stack. Now then when you have the mats, you have to hope rng is in your favor and proc a nobles card. The other cards are not even worth mentioning since they're not that good except for maybe Death. It may not be as bad as levelling enchanting, but atleast they have an income they can fall back on, I haven't really been able to make much profit from this profession.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you need to reread the card from the nobles deck, it is based on whatever stat you have the highest at that time. So if your highest stat is strength, it adds to that, if it's spirit it will increase that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blikje</div><div class="date">2008-12-09, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So to be extremely inaccurate and just to give an impression about why i think the whole &quot;endgame is too easy QQ&quot; is rediculous i'm gonna make this very inaccurate calculation.<br />
<br />
Satharion 25 men has been killed 4657 times now. I don't have any idea if it's 4657 kills by any guild or all first kills by 4657 guilds, i'm guessing it's the first option but just to illustrate how rediculous the whole QQ is i'm going with the last option: 4657 kills * 25 player/guild = 116425 players witnessed a Sartharion kill. 116425 killers / 11000000 total player * 100 = 1.06% of the total player base witnessed a kill. Unless allot of people stopped playing the expansion and blizzard didn't announce this (yet) 1.06% is the absolute maximum percentage of players killing the easiest 25 man boss (ignoring the adds skip which ofcourse could illustrate 1.06% of the player base killed Sartharion on hard mode but this is unlikely) within a month and it's very likely this percentage is waaaaaaay lower.<br />
<br />
My guess is we're at least 2 months from the real point where 1% of the player base witnissed a Sartharion kill and even more months from the point where 1% cleared the whole endgame content. I'm also taking the wild guess about the release of the next content patch but I bet it won't take Blizzard much longer than those 2 months.<br />
<br />
For all the people who want to ignore this post completely just because it has allot of guessing I might suggest they stop paying attention to what they don't like. It might not be very accurate but it's good enough to see there is no easy content unless you belong to a ver minor group of elite players. You might ask if this very small elite group of players don't deserve more. Well ofcourse it sucks for them but the resources required to give them what they wanted would probably be pulled out of the resources used to overwhelm the other 99% which would be a bad decision for Blizzard. <br />
<br />
It's an expansion and they should put their focus on the big group of people to keep them playing the game, they don't need allot of attention after this expansion since they'll take more time to go trough the content. When you make content for the elite part you also make content the big group can do when they get to it. I'm glad they put most of the resources into creating the leveling curve wotlk had, the whole game got a better base which will benefit the elite players in the end too.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the rant but i'm really sick of people yelling &quot;wotlk is too easy&quot; while they probably didn't even clear the whole endgame content yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Limelight</div><div class="date">2008-12-09, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I lucked out this past week. I had the mats gathered for 8 cards, unaware that the Darkmoon Cards of the North were random. Unfortunately, I got only two Nobles cards out of the eight. I did a bit of spam in trade chat offering to trade the cards I had for Nobles, and one player traded for four of the cards I needed. I found the other two on the AH for about 1k gold a piece, finished the deck and got my card last night.<br />
<br />
The mats, at least on Khadgar US are very expensive, on average 700-800 gold to get one card made. Pretty pricey hoping you'll get a good run of Nobles. The card is awesome, though, procs very frequently.</div></div><hr />

A guildie of mine bought the same deck for about the same price with the same method. There were ppl on my server selling whole nobles decks for about 15k. The other decks were going between 10-12k each.<br />
<br />
For ret pallies the greatness str deck is going to be one of the best trinkets (if not the best trinket) in the game for you. It procs often and increased my dps significantly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At Ravencrest its about 2000g per card from the Nobel deck, saw the Ace for 6000g. Pretty retarded imo and the prices will go down.<br />
I might buy the odd card from AH but its still way to expensive :/</div></div><hr />

The worst part is the Azure Pigment you end up with from making cards and doing your research that can only be effectively dumped into vellums that sell very erratically and nowhere near in volumes large enough to be able to get rid of all the pigment without destroying the market.</div></div><hr />

eff the &quot;dual spec&quot;...just make respecing free....it would be soooo much easier!!!!<br />
<br />
Trust me when I say that it's no compairison, but seriously look at guild wars. That game has a free re-talent thing where you can do it anywhere. I think that WoW should do the same thing, not re-talenting on a stick.... Just make it a full out free-respec cost, even if you have to go to a trainer to do it, this would be a much better idea...</div></div><hr />
