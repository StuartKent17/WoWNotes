<br />
<br />
Savage Raptor (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/97581/savage-raptor/#13623/13682) will be a WoW TCG reward but doesn't have any model for the moment.<br />
Amani Dragonhawk (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96503/amani-dragonhawk/) is also included in this patch and is also supposed to be a WoW TCG Reward but doesn't look like it has any final model either. <br />
Nightsaber Cub (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96819/nightsaber-cub/#13623/13682) will be a WoW TCG rewards but other versions of the panther cubs will be available through questing/rare drops apparently.<br />

The Zulian Panther just isn't a standard Night Elf mount model, it's the EXACT(minus saddle) model and skin of the long removed, feat of strength, original epic Reigns of the Nightsaber. That's really lame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although I do agree with you 100% that armorless cats &gt; armored cats.. the panther is just.. not shiny? I dunno. I love that it's armorless, but hmm.. it's just.. so plain. It needs some sort of tinkering, but I can't quite put my finger on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and I am in love with the hippogryph. But I'm a hippogryph lover anyway, so I'm a little bias. *hugs her hippogryph hatchling* ^_^ Fire hawks are great.. green seems.. idk.. I love the fiery one though. And I foresee a lot of saber cub farming for me.. heh. I'm going to guess that the Winterspring &amp; Frostsaber ones will be drops in Winterspring. Or the Winter cub could come from the Winter trainers. The Panther could come from ZG just like the mount. No clue about the White one. Reward for 100 or 125 pets? o:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varicose</div><div class="date">2011-02-27, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first thoughts on the fire hawks, after watching the video, they just don't seemed finish... I mean maybe they are. But with how the wings clip into the ground, and some of the animations look slightly clunky with that skin on the proto-drake skeleton. I sense some possible tweaking. I really like the other mounts though. The raptor being red makes me fear for the fate of poor little Oghan from the ZG quest line :( The panther is some what of a let down compared to its predecessor. But again, it's all PTR so content is subject to change.<br />
<br />
P.S. I love Australia. They have great women and have great stories of Kangaroo's busting through their sliding glass door mid raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am really hoping its just a reskin for the moment and not at release. Its much easier to reskin a model and then refine the animations later, than build things from the ground up lol. I am also hoping that the panther model gets revamped, otherwise it is a very disappointing mount replacement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For everyone else qq-ing about them being proto-drake skeletons, you all sound really spoiled right now. Did you see the video? Did you see that the colors are moving on the model? They aren't set colors like all the mounts, they have alternating glow patterns, making the fire actually realistic instead of being orange with a bunch of sparkly ribbons. I don't know much about programming, but for them to pull off something like that on a mount seems kinda epic. Who cares if they use the same animations? The flight animation is fairly universal for most mounts, and how often are you going to be running on your flying mount to care if it's the same? At least it doesn't have the doofy little arms.<br />
<br />
Also - any idea (besides the raptor and the panther) where these drop/are awarded?</div></div><hr />

Flameward Hippogryph is epic, if it ends in TCG, i kill an innocent bunny. and get a count up in my Guild Achei.<br />
the tiger is little awww, compared to the first, but yeah, then they get to keep the awesomeness, which is fair. the raptor is still awesome. and Horde still gets a kitty, thats awesome!<br />
those hawks are epic, sure they look like Proto Drakes, but most of us loved proto drakes, and those are really epic, they is nothing like a Proto Drake, they just got bone problems. i bet one of them is rare drop, probaly the green one because it fits troll stuff, and the other from Glory of the Firelands Raider (or what they gonna call it).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's not pretend we don't know where this drops. It's either the Mount reward for the Raid Achs related to the place where Ragnaros will be the final boss (A la iroundbound proto) or it's a drop off Ragnaros proper (a la invincible). The two colors are just an obvious distinction between 10 and 25man. The end.<br />
<br />
Conclusion, most of us are never ever getting this. <br />
<br />
And som1 said: &quot;no ways, makes no sense they don't do that in cata.&quot;<br />
<br />
euh well let's face it, this mount has the same armor design as Ragnaros and its obviously fire related, so it has to be in direct correlation with the firelands raid and given the effort that went into to, it certainly won't be some lolwy reputation reward or a lol drop off the 1st boss. Now I might be wrong that the color is a distinction between 10 and 25 but then that just means one is PvE and the other PvP (top arena). The point is however you look at it this mount is another Invincible, nobody or almost nobody will own one.<br />
<br />
Also I'd be willing to bet you my account that Ragnaros now has legs in order to ride this around.</div></div><hr />

This right here. Blizzard reskins everything. Hell even most new armor sets (including tier and pvp gear) are just simple reskins.<br />
<br />
That said, I don't see these going live as they are, they're just terrible and IMO obviously unfinished, at the very least they're missing particle effects and probably some details on the body.<br />
<br />
Seriously, it looks like someone took a proto drake into photoshop and used the smudge tool and not much else. I have no doubts that they're unfinished. I dunno about the Panther though but I'm not at all into it. They should just release the tiger and give it slightly different colored armor and a different name or something.</div></div><hr />

Oh, wow. This is absolutely terrible so far. Oh, man, this is so funny how bad Blizz is scraping the bottom of the barrel and reusing old, dead crap because they can't think of anything new. I mean, they even make these totally awesome looking hawkpheonixs brimming with badassery and they use the skele/animations of the proto drakes. That looks so retarded! Ahahaha. What hawk would crawl like a bat? It doesn't even make sense with the model! Hahaha.<br />

And, if those links are what I think they are, Blizzard is spitting in the face of every person who bought Lil' XT and Lil' KT. (and even the people who spend hundreds on the fire hippogryph) Not to mention the terrible looking, stretched-skin, reskinning of kittens...yuck. The face looks terrible. Like it got hit with the same ugly stick they beat the Druid waterform with. And then there's the panther... I mean, I know this must be SO hard for Blizzard, but every single thing they could put on that panther to make it more 'Troll' or 'Zulian' is already in the game. Hell, just move your eyes to the left slightly and look at the raptor. Feathers, bones, leather. Look to the Troll Druid cat forms. But no, it's cool, let's just rerelease the 6 year old model for NE mounts. Yeah, we've got more important butchering of badassery in the form of fire hawks to do right now!

It's either the Mount reward for the Raid Achs related to the place where Ragnaros will be the final boss (A la iroundbound proto) or it's a drop off Ragnaros proper (a la invincible). The two colors are just an obvious distinction between 10 and 25man. The end.<br />
<br />
<br />
Although it is possible it will be a Glory of the Raider Achievement for the new Raid Instance.. I doubt there will be different colours for 10/25 seeing as they are now shared.... right?<br />
<br />
So it has some options. Glory of the Sulfuron Spire Raider, Guild Glory of the Sulfuron Spire Raider, Maybe there is some Fire Hawk Boss in Sulfuron Spire that will drop it as a low drop rate. Or Even a hard mode reward from heroic Rag. Either way there are gonna be 2 sources of the mount, it's not just gonna be from one Glory Achv for 10/25</div></div><hr />

this is the first 4.1 build to be publicly tested. there's bound to be more content added to 4.1 as the ptr cycles along, including updated ZA, Firelands raid, and other raid content (Abyssal Maw raid perhaps? maybe something in Deepholm?)<br />

Yes, there are *some* dangerous creatures. But we don't have earthquakes (usually) or volcanos. Our bushfires (wild fires?) are surprisingly smaller than California. The cyclones (hurricanes/typhoons for the rest of the world) only hit the remote top end of Australia (ie, every major city and 90%+ of the population are free from them).<br />

Just remember, there's anti-venom for a funnel web and a brown snake. There's no anti-venom for molten lava.<br />

I loved the hawk when I saw the misleading picture of it that made it look like more of a pheonix than the pheonix but then noticed that it was just a proto drake in reverse. They're better than no mounts though and let's not kid ourselves; we will all be using them for awhile if and when we get them.</div></div><hr />

There is only one attainable in the game and that is the Winterspring Frostsaber.<br />
Not really. As the mounts' speed adapts to your riding skill since 4.0, there's now a variety of armorless cats to choose from if you're Alliance. And as a Horde you won't be able to get the Winterspring Saber afaik... But that's the point for me: Horde characters can get a cat mount again. Now my BE paladin will ride a tiger exactly as her human counterpart does (it's Winterspring there, since mid-BC ;) ). And the fact that it has no armor makes it even better for me.</div></div><hr />

Starting with yourself. The model is not something exclusive from skeletons or skins, they contain both of these things. The skeleton is your starting point, your first layer, and after you're skeleton is completed you add the next layer which is of course the skin. This of course is a very basic introduction to these things, but hopefully it'll keep tards like yourself from claiming people need to be educated about anything here.<br />

How dare you use an old animation skeleton to mock up the model for your new mount, a flying mount with essentially identical requirements to the one you are using as its base. (Two wings, two legs, and a head with a mouth.)<br />
<br />
I demand that you use the absolute most difficult means of creating anything. Any time you make a new drake or dragon or horse, I demand that you create new animation skeletons from scratch for each and every one before working on the animations. Tweaking existing skeletons is nothing but lazy, you bastards.<br />
<br />
I demand that you release 100% fully realized models to the public test server before a large chunk of the content that goes along with it is even ready to be tested.</div></div><hr />

I love to see someone trying to act like some educated forum gentlemen while calling someone a &quot;tard&quot;. The things are reskinned proto drakes, just because it's not the same kind of reskinning between say a green and red proto drake is irrelevant. What is displayed is essentially the same model, it's simply skinned with big green flames rather than a traditional texture.</div></div><hr />

The difference between those mounts is not their skin, it is simply their color palette, a better distinction would be the Ulduar Proto Drakes versus any of the other Proto Drakes, but even that is not a difference in skin, there were simply different textures applied to the same models.<br />

All this QQ is always hilarious, thanks for that! It's even funnier how all the whiners try to justify their bitching by calling everyone else a fanboy of some sort.

Let's turn this into a &quot;PTR is PTR&quot; and I'm pretty sure they will update it though nothing is decided yet. There's most likely 1.5 months left for this to go live :-)<br />

Why Cata dont bring new skeleton for mount? These bird and Cata drakes have skeletons from old mounts. But I am not talking only about mounts. Everyting is old (except new races, but i think worgen cast animation is recykled too. If you remember q in northrend in strom peaks with blue women). <br />
<br />
Everything is comming back. Why you make spectral wolf? becouse ppl cry about spectral tiger? Spectral tiger dont look epic now. You baraly notice him. Same with Scarab from AQ. I know ppl wants something Blizz give them everything what they want. Sad.<br />
<br />
I love WoW but i think i try Rift. Its WoW/War copy, but why not. I love WoW. But what i get a fresh new look, fresh new moutns not only reskinned skeletons. It possible I will return to WoW. But I want Rift steal many subscribers. Why? Maybe Blizz wake up from dream and actualy start make better WoW.</div></div><hr />

Then they will be fine. Leave the rest of the animation if they are lazy...just fix that. What the hell kinda bird stands around with its wings like that.</div></div><hr />

By looking at the animation and the way the wings clip in the ground it is pretty obvious these aren't going to keep the proto-drake animation... And if they do I'll eat my hats.<br />

ALL OF THEM.<br />

Now my favourite colour is green, but that red one just looks so much better right now...</div></div><hr />

Get over it. Reusing skeleton molds is common in mmos. Raft or any others game in the future will be no different.</div></div><hr />

its common in games period, some going far off and just having one skel through the entire game.</div></div><hr />

On a sidenote, though, while I was just checking a vid on blazing hippogryph, I noticed how it streamlines itself when running, which I think is awesome. Kind of a letdown though, when I noticed the character (even though it was just a tiny gnome) did no such thing and just sat there, doing nothing. Since it's not about these actual models, would boub punch me in the face if I whined about wanting characters to get a bit more animation while they're mounted? I mean they're fairly static now..</div></div><hr />

Somehow I find it fitting the theme... Hyjal + Ragnaros raid. Tons of NE stuff set on fire, lol.</div></div><hr />
