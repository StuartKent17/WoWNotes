KIN Raiders Post Spine of Deathwing Interview<br />
Playforum interviewed (http://wow.playforum.net/news/wowhot/id/1049407) KIN Raiders after their Spine of Deathwing kill, and Utsusemi was nice enough to translate (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1047919-KIN-Raiders-interview-after-Madness-of-Deathwing-%28Translated%29) the interesting questions.<br />
<br />
Q: How did you farm and prepare to clear DS?<br />
A: As many people know, US &amp; EU had some troubles involving LFR. As for us, we brought 3 mains that did not overlap with each others' tier drops and 23 alts that have already done LFR, which facilitated the gearing of our mains. All in all, each member has gone through LFR about 26 times.<br />
<br />
During the first week of the patch, in normal mode DS, we formed 6 teams - each consisting of 8-9 mains + alt fill-ins. We also had 1 team farming 10 man mode. When hard mode became available, we focused on gearing up the guild as a whole rather than prioritizing loot based on ranks. We formed 3 teams mixing mains and alts - and consistently farmed for progression. This has helped a lot in the latter half of DS.<br />
<br />
Q: What did you feel the 'best' DPS class was for this raid?<br />
A: In all circumstances, a class with good survivability and DPS can be considered the best. In this dungeon, a class that can survive well while providing great burst was the best DPS class. And we think Mage and Rogue were the two classes that best fit that criteria.<br />
<br />
For Rogues, subtlety tree was buffed (great survivability and burst) so they were very viable. And for Mages, arcane provided better burst than any other class while fire gave better survivability. However, it's impossible to defeat the latter half the encounters with just these two classes. It is critical that other classes provide support/utility for them.<br />
<br />
Q: Can you provide the raid comp for Spine and Madness of Deathwing encounters? Also, the number of attempts for them as well?<br />
A: Regarding the raid composition, you can check that through armory. According to our DBM log, we gave about 300 attempts for the Spine. And for the last encounter, we downed it on our 108th attempt.<br />
<br />
Q: A lot of people are speculating about the 4 shamans involved in the Spine encounter. Can you clear things up for us?<br />
A: For the Spine, we had 3 restoration shamans and 1 elemental shaman. Two of the resto shamans were alts. Also one of those two alts' main spec was elemental.<br />
<br />
As a side joke, one of our elemental shamans (Detonator is the name) had to be benched for 3 hrs because he could not pull the DPS needed. He had to practice DPS on dummy before getting pulled back in lol.<br />
<br />
Q: In US &amp; EU, many people are claiming that you used an exploit using SLT, which allegedly negates a debuff that lowers your health.<br />
A: Regarding that, we have received personal apologies from MMO-Champion and Paragon website (From the people that made such claims). At that time, I wasn't too concerned about it because I was focused on the next encounter. But when we finally release the video of our kill, all of the suspicions will go away.<br />
<br />
Q: The time you spent on Madness, compared to Spine, was rather short. How would you compare the difficulty between the two?<br />
A: Spine was harder. It was as if a huge wall was blocking your way. Every time you first encounter a difficult boss, you can naturally feel that way. For Madness, it was like &quot;hey, this isn't so bad&quot;. As for the Spine, it was more like &quot;we don't wanna repeat this next week...&quot; But no matter what, the members that had to be on stand-by had to go through the most stress by far.<br />
<br />
Q: When will you be releasing a kill video of the last two encounters?<br />
A: Once another guild has achieved a kill, we'll be releasing the video.<br />
<br />
Q: It seems like more alts were part of the raid than mains for this dungeon. Is this correct?<br />
A: Yes, it is. For the Spine, 3 of the Mages were alts and 2 of the resto Shamans were alts. We wanted to prepare for the unexpected. So since FL, we consistently farmed for alts.<br />
<br />
Q: Is there a reason why you did that?<br />
A: Every patch, we as a guild, had problems with limited roster. However, we feel that composition is far more important than the number of raiders. Say we have 25 people online. If those 25 people have access to most of the classes, creating a fitting raid composition becomes very easy.<br />
<br />
For DS, each member had 2-4 classes ready for progression.<br />
<br />
Q: For this raid, class specs seemed very critical. Can you give us a word on that?<br />
A: For tanks, Paladins were far inferior to DKs and Druids. Thus, prot Paladins were benched. Also, enhancement Shamans and Hunters had to be benched for Madness encounter as the pets weren't attacking tendons. For healers, holy Paladins and resto Shamans were good. Other healing classes had to be on stand-by. And for caster DPS, boomkins had to be benched most of the time. I want to thank all of them for sticking around for the entire duration of the fights.<br />
<br />
Q: Would you like to say a word to other guilds that are attempting to clear DS?<br />
A: Never give up! It is imperative to stick together and have faith that you can do it. Every guild wants to give up at one point or another. But nothing can be achieved with one big shot. If you take it one step at a time, you will be rewarded for your effort.<br />
<br />
Q: Any shout outs to the fans?<br />
A: Thank you for your supports. We want to be remembered as raiders that always enjoy raiding. Thank you.<br />

Daily Quests and Boredom<br />
Dailies and grinding. You want X, you have to perform Y dailies for Z period of time. You grind rep and gold and then you get what you want. This is what I explained. &quot;But that's just like a job. I already have a job. When can we do something fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
It's easy to design a better system than dailies, pump out infinite amounts of content, it's just not feasible to pull off. Some people want to spend more time in the game than others, maybe even every day, and we want to make sure they have something to do. While we'd love for that to be fresh and unique content every time, it's simply not feasible. Thus, dailies. Give people something to do each time they log in (if they choose to do so every day).<br />
<br />
Not to toot the Mists of Pandaria horn too hard, but I think our general zone design, daily, and scenario approach is pretty solid. Part of what makes dailies a bit tedious, aside from being tedious, is the rewards are desired but may not always quite fit the time investment. I see quite a bit of that being solved and making sure if you're logging in to do some dailies or scenarios, you feel like you made a good chunk of progress toward advancing your character.<br />
<br />
It's not going to be a revolution or anything, don't get me wrong, but I think it'll at least feel better. No one likes being the guy on the assembly line putting the left index finger on the doll 250 times a day, 5 days a week. They might not mind it as much though if they're paid $100k a year. Right?

<br />
You realise they only got 2 lockouts on FL and previous tier, not on DS? Which means nothing in the race to kill DW.<br />
<br />
EU + US guilds could of have the luxury if they wanted to grind it out like KIN did. Even if they did go through FL god knows how many times, that doesn't matter seens as they went through LFR 26 times and did multiple normal raids with Mains/Alts.<br />
<br />
The only reason it wasn't completely on equal terms was because some guilds were stupid enough to go and abuse a bug, they knew full well would have got them punished as they gained a significant advantage. But vodka and some other top guilds didn't do this and they're still 6/8. These guys must have literally spent 21h/day doing Spine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors were left out of Madness by the look, however, the Spine kill had a warrior doing the 10 billion blood kite. Prot Warriors are pretty amazing kiters(I remember having the perma-job on Neffy on the adds), I am guessing that the Madness kill requires the very high-health tanks with the 4pcs? We'll find out more there, but from what I could tell Madness used a stamina bear and a DK tank. I could be wrong on that though, as I've only seen the one list posted somewhere in the comments from the WF Madness kill. Looking forward to seeing that kill vid as well in any case.<br />

Last I checked, ferals were stacked on Nefarian because a specific fight mechanic caused their bleeds' damage to increase beyond what was intended. When it was found out, ferals were stacked to take advantage of that, which was considered an exploit by some. But you already know that, and are trying to discredit the KIN kill.

Every raid member has 2-4 alts (that is probably geared as good as their mains). And, that they play as good as their mains.<br />
Every raid member has done LFR about 26 times to gear eachother up properly.<br />
They have been farming HC FL for months to get the ultimate tools for DS progress.<br />
<br />
They didnt give a rats ass about other Top-End guilds saying... &quot;X class suck, use Y class instead&quot;.<br />
This guild had 300+ wipes on this encounter. They have probably tried all humanly known existing compositions before they finally settled on 7 mages and 5 druids.<br />

I just cant imagine (im casual lol) the amount of work put into these (SoDW and MoDW) kills. And fun part is... They are all open about everything. From class compos, tictacs... everything.. :cool:<br />

If it averaged out to 10 minutes, that would be seven hours of raiding a day for the seven days it took (not including rebuffing and cutscenes). Double edit: According to this interview (http://www.nordrassilradio.com/site/an-interview-with-paragon/), Paragon used 170 attempts on Heroic Lich King. Edit: Also, massive congratulations of course. Given that they knew other guilds were bug abusing and didn't do that themselves, that they were willing to bring completely different chars to a different fight and that they're wholly encouraging to other guilds without being arrogant, I think they definitely deserve the kill.</div></div><hr />

Yes they had the &quot;extra lockouts&quot; but that didnt enable them to aquire extra loot. This is because they accessed the content later. You can visit there amories for kill numbers and compare them to other top guilds such as Paragon, Blood Legion etc.<br />

You are looking at LFR kill number count. (The number that certain guilds have more than 20 times, and they got banned from using the loot exploit. lol) YOU HAVE TO look at their normal/heroic count. Everything is equal or less than 3 kills, the normal number. <br />

Is it just not considered a bug, or am I misunderstanding the way the debuff is meant to work? Because fairly clearly, the effect of the debuff is being counteracted somehow. As an example, at 8:32, post spirit link, the shaman has 161k HP with 4 stacks of amalgamation debuff. He should have ~120k. What's the deal?An amazing achievement, and I will be happy to eat my words if I am just misunderstanding the situation.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Osyrus</div><div class="date">2011-12-22, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q: How did you farm and prepare to clear DS?<br />
A: As many people know, US &amp; EU had some troubles involving LFR. As for us, we brought 3 mains that did not overlap with each others' tier drops and 23 alts that have already done LFR, which facilitated the gearing of our mains. All in all, each member has gone through LFR about 26 times.<br />
<br />
During the first week of the patch, in normal mode DS, we formed 6 teams - each consisting of 8-9 mains + alt fill-ins. We also had 1 team farming 10 man mode. When hard mode became available, we focused on gearing up the guild as a whole rather than prioritizing loot based on ranks. We formed 3 teams mixing mains and alts - and consistently farmed for progression. This has helped a lot in the latter half of DS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now im just saying because I do not know-<br />
<br />
Did other raid groups do this? This seems like another exploit of the LFR system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is not an exploit due to people that are getting loot only got loot off each boss once, as opposed to looting the same boss multiple times per week, what they did was made it only so a specific character was getting loot that run, as opposed to 25 people getting loot that run.<br />
<br />
If you felt like it, even though you cleared 8/8 LFR you can still re-que right now. You wouldn't be eligible for anything but you can still kill bosses.<br />

Incorrect. How are people still getting this wrong, it's been months now!<br />

Any high dot class could do what a feral cat did, ferals just brought a crap load more to the raid. They exploited nothing and everything was working as the mechanics intended, you can prove it yourself doing some maths and looking at the numbers.<br />

The reason it was changed was because Blizzard didn't like how well dot classes did on the fight, making it utterly stupid to bring anyone but them, so they reworked the way the debuff worked.<br />

<br />
Blood Legion has done this the same way, they even have a screenshot of the excel sheet they made to make sure everyone has no other main rolling on the same loot/token.<br />
But then, in the end the loot still has to drop.<br />
<br />
It is a perfectly legitemate way to get more loot into your main raid group, only takes a decent planning and lot of time/alts/other ppl in your guild willing to run lfr and passing on stuff.<br />

I'm guessing you meant they quickly downed Ultraxion? To be fair, that was the 5th boss there, but the question is whether the 5th boss should be tuned for higher than BiS heroic gear from the previous tier. If you actually meant they quickly downed Spine, it took them 130 more attempts than Heroic Lich King took Paragon. Besides, are random drop chance legendaries any better? The only difference with random drop chance legendaries is that if the effect is enough to carry players (M'uru and KJ with glaives both took less time to down than Spine of Deathwing for example), then hardcore guilds will need to continue to farm them without being able to predict when their roster will have a sufficient level of legendaries to complete the encounter, ninjaing will be even easier and recipients of legendaries will be more likely to gquit to join progressed guilds, since progressed guilds may have been penalised by RNG. If they are such a huge dps increase, lesser progressed guilds that benefit from the RNG and have the legendary holder stick around will be carried by it too, even if they don't regularly get as many of the bosses down as the guilds that currently farm guaranteed legendaries.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think so for dps with normal gear ( not speaking of legendarys) I see for my raids that most damage dealers are very close, some fights favor that specc some others, i feel free to say that the tank/heal/dd balance is one of the best atm compared to wow history. And yeah i switch to arcane too for the fight because fire is too much of a luck game and arcane has better burst, so when burst is need why would won use classes that dont provide any like warlocks, shadows or moonkins (which would deal to much aoe damge in this fight also). When classes are left out it doesn't mean they are broken beyond repair but maybe not valueable enough in the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kinda surprises me they didn't have more shadowpriests, but I guess mages would be better on spine, on madness they are just awesome. My guess is that the reason the priest they have is so low is because he was taking the first impales, and then they used the two other priests in the composition to GS the second and third impales which allowed them to Kill the Ysera platform first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any high dot class could do what a feral cat did, ferals just brought a crap load more to the raid. They exploited nothing and everything was working as the mechanics intended, you can prove it yourself doing some maths and looking at the numbers.<br />
<br />
The reason it was changed was because Blizzard didn't like how well dot classes did on the fight, making it utterly stupid to bring anyone but them, so they reworked the way the debuff worked.<br />
<br />
Gah - Grats Kin, the kiting at the end got my blood pumping as well <br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/spell=80319<br />
It basically let cats have insane rip ticks with or without buff after nef reached 25% hp<br />
<br />
<br />
This.<br />
Nef's buff only boosts one next attack. Druids would use Rip, Warlock Bane of Doom, etc. But only druids could refresh the initial high damage dot due to that talent. Other classes recasting their dot would just overwrite it by a normal damage version, as was intended. <br />
The bug, and thus exploit, was that Rip kept the buffed damage by refreshing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, awesome job Kin!</div></div><hr />

On most fights its just a handy thing, on this fight its cruicial. On alot of the fights in DS Arcane and Fire are pretty similar in overall dmg but are useful for different things. Ultrax? Arcane (unless your soaking), Yorsahj? Fire all the way, etc etc. Just so happens that rogues and mages have the best pve burst on a 2min cd. Too bad we give up alot to be able to do it. Btw that meter is tendons only, so those numbers are expected. This fight is Only about the tendons really, the rest is fairly simple aside from needing one awesome blood tank.You will notice for madness alot of those mages got benched for other classes (but probably the same players)</div></div><hr />

It's not overall boss dps. If you look at when it switches to the Arc-mages PoV for the first time you'll notice that there's no damage in the damage meter until the first tendon is hit. The issue with finding an accurate one is that the R-sham only has the first 8 up on his (which does appear to be running full time) and you don't see his PoV for the last 2-3 minutes. Figure the one you have up is rather misleading unless you preface it with &quot;This is only damage done to Burning Tendons&quot; &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
A) You are Blizzard.<br />
B) You are making still making millions of dollars on this game.<br />
C) You had 5 months 4.2 to 4.3 release, and surely time before hand to think of things.<br />
<br />
I find it hard to believe a company as renowned as Blizzard with nigh unlimited amounts of money says something is simply impossible. Even if it's just hiring more artists and animators. They are always saying, oh, it'd be nice but we couldn't get it in because our art team is already tied up.<br />

It's easy to design a better system than dailies, pump out infinite amounts of content, it's just not feasible to pull off<br />

So they should just swap out legendaries with epics, so it makes a more &quot;skillfull kill&quot; ? Yeah, nice logic.</div></div><hr />

Well feel free to convince your guild not to use legendaries and report back about how they do on Spine of Deathwing (better yet, convince the guilds with equal numbers of legendaries like Blood Legion and Paragon not to use them since you'll consider them more legit). I'm sure Kin will be glad for your feedback about how they didn't demonstrate any skill over 300 attempts. Btw Kil'Jaeden doesn't count either, it would have taken at least as long as Spine of Deathwing if Sk wasn't stacking glaive rogues (anyone remember that?).</div></div><hr />

New Flash! Some classes are better at some things than other classes. In this case, burst DPS was very important and mages and rogues do it well.<br />
<br />
Besides, no one here is competing on this level anyways. If you're having DPS problems the issue isn't likely your class spec. :-/</div></div><hr />

So Ghostcrawler's idea of class balance is &quot;bring the mages not any other class&quot;? <br />
<br />
Someone should ask him what class he plans on playing next before he gets fired so people can have some fun in the sun.</div></div><hr />

A class balance discussion should not revolve around difficult heroic encounters where guilds will push the game and characters to their limits in order to get a world first. They've stated this several times after world firsts in this expansion. A shaman being non-existant in the world first Heroic Rag kill means nothing. Just as stacking rogues and mages with legendaries means nothing on the most difficult encounter of this tier. Trying to hint that they do only shows you know little of actual class balance.</div></div><hr />

There is nothing wrong with class stacking per se. Different classes are and should be better at certain encounters. Nothing wrong with that. But if mages/rouges can pull nearly twice the damage that warlocks and spriests are able to do, you have a pretty huge balance problem/terrible encounter design.</div></div><hr />

It's because their country isn't retarded and realised the value of the internet to modern society, and they also aren't bent over backwards by telecom and cable companies looking to make more money every year while providing less service.<br />

Yeah just this! Sadly most of the western countries have not yet realized how important internet is to the future and this future has already begun.

The problem here in the States is that we're so spread out and have so much damn land to cover for nationwide fiber. S. Korea is roughly the size of Indiana, so it's much easier and more efficient to run fiber nationwide.</div></div><hr />

Allllllright I gotta call BS on this one. I spend quite a few hours a week at work querying large online databases. The idea that 5ms pings are in any way PRACTICALLY superior to 100MS pings in ANYTHING but gaming is a bit laughable. I mean really... think about it logically for a minute.<br />
<br />
OT: Apologies for assuming you exploited SLT! It's not so much a fanboi/regional issue, as it is that I've been conditioned to expect the worst in people. Happy I was wrong, and gratz on the kill. The people talking on vent sounded like they had ice flowing through their veins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is sadly the reason a free market society like the US is beginning to fall behind. Too many things in this country are entrenched and need to be changed to progress as a society, but this is where big business is a bad thing. Cable doesn't want to spend the money to upgrade and make things better when they can just get away with less and continue to raise rates.<br />
<br />
Car companies and going to electric or more efficient engines has been slow because the big companies and oil companies don't want to lose money.<br />
<br />
Health care is a joke because insurance companies hold everything back because they raise rates so much.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not advocating a return to Mother Russia, but seriously, some things have got to change.</div></div><hr />

More interesting content doesn't have to be something other than dailies, but if the nature of the dailies is more varied, they each become more interesting and repeatable. Firelands is a bland and ugly place to play in. Give me end-game dailies in other parts of Azeroth that all reward a less-specific currency, and I might have stayed interested in the game. As it is, their rewards don't come anywhere near close to an assembly line worker being paid $100k.</div></div><hr />
