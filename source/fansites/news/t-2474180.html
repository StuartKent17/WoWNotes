<br />
You aren't being pessimistic. The game is in quite a state atm with players leaving left, right and centre.<br />
<br />
And sadly a good chunk of the content barring Nazjatar should have been in launch or 8.1.<br />
<br />
Also what an actual spit in the face to oldschool Warcraft fans making Crestfall an Island Expedition.</div></div><hr />

Really? It takes a special kind of blind hatred to read that list and think it is a small amount of content.<br />

You could fly in the Broken Shore which was 7.2. So you may be able to fly in Nazjatar.</div></div><hr />

Flying is usually only possible in zones that are part of the initial maps of an expansion. They may make an exception with nazjatar, but don't think they will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No actually we want Blizzard to craft an entire plethora of zones with intricate details and quests.... And give us a way to skip the 30-90 seconds trying to climb that stupid hill with wonky collision, for that one WQ we have already done 10+ times.<br />
<br />
Also we want Blizzard to craft zones with 3 dimensional travel in mind every once in a while as well, and considering how often the flying crowed gets the shaft as it goes for current content, I'm more then happy to let the no fly crew eat rocks every once in a while, and &quot;suffer&quot; through a flying zone for one current patch *GASP*.<br />
<br />
And lets be honest here blocking flying isn't getting people out in the world, it just funnels them all into the kill one guy quests as close to the flight paths as humanly possible, because no one wants to deal with anything else :p</div></div><hr />

No, Cathy Newman, I want them to do what they did in BC, WoTLK, Cataclysm, Pandaria<br />

No a tiny raid is Obsidian Sanctum and Ruby Sanctum, this new one is a decent enough size.. We can't always have 14 boss raids, hell some of the best raids didn't have many bosses in them..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uldir-8 bosses<br />
BoD- 9 bosses<br />
CoS- 2 bosses<br />
AeP- 8 bosses<br />
Final raid- 11 bosses. <br />
<br />
38 bosses in total. Just a guess, but probably close. <br />
<br />
Cata had 28 bosses.<br />
WoD had 30 bosses. <br />
MoP had 42 bosses.<br />
Legion had 40 bosses. <br />
<br />
Not going to count Wrath/TBC because it was the era of complete raid or die and had a good bit more bosses than modern WoW. <br />
<br />
So BFA likely has 36-42 bosses depending on how large the final raid is. Totally average.</div></div><hr />

Very hope it would be much better, than initial BFA content. And finally real BFA's story will be released. Tauren heritage armor - is also one of those things, I'm looking forward. But at the same time I have some doubts about it. A year without flying - is the longest period of time in Wow's history, except Vanilla. What kind of content 8.2 will provide? Another PVP-biased crap? Or more PVEish content this time? How long will it take to earn Pathfinder Part II for players, who will buy BFA after 8.2 release? Many questions.</div></div><hr />

i mean, Naxx 25 was a shitty remake, but regardless of that t7 had 17 bosses, Ulduar had 14 bosses and ICC had 12<br />

so not really tiny, cuz outside of Vanilla those would be considered pretty big<br />

<br />
Did they even acknowledge there would be a &quot;final raid&quot;? <br />
It is entirely possible they will do a WoD and just cut their losses after 8.2 meaning you have an expansion with 27 bosses.<br />
What is worse is that the Crucible bosses (2) will likely be the least killed bosses following the Trial of Valor raid bosses. It's a raid that is technically there but counting it as content is just being silly since there is no reason to actually go in there, because the rewards on the difficulty you can actually clear will be worse than the gear you got already. That is unless they tune mythic mode to be easier than the first three bosses of BoD.<br />
<br />
In general larger raids have been more enjoyable as it allows the entry bosses to be pushovers and the end boss be a roadblock and still allow progress for most of the raiding population. With 8 bosses there is just too little room to have a proper difficulty curve.</div></div><hr />

Then Blizzard deceived us after creating the player base.</div></div><hr />

It is entirely possible they will do a WoD and just cut their losses after 8.2 meaning you have an expansion with 27 bosses.<br />
<br />
With WoD, they cut their losses and did the final raid. We just didn't get the middle raid which most likely was going to Shattrath. For them to cut their losses now, they'd have to cut the final raid, which would be really weird since the final raids usually lead into the next expansion.<br />
<br />
I don't think they'll cut the final raid, I can see them rushing it though and cutting a lot of the outdoors content that usually comes with the final raid, possibly down to another timeless island.</div></div><hr />

Interestingly, my count give 50 bosses to The Burning Crusade also...<br />

Yeah I ain't falling for the Broken Shore 2.0 again.<br />
<br />
Well it's a good thing that WoW at least releases 8 bosses in a raid, 2 new landmasses, new story, a gigantic and properly fun dungeon, new mounts, pets, toys, side quests, in one patch, when your favourite MMO ever that you like to fap to supposedly releases better content.

Archavon, Emalon, Koralon, and Toravon. I know you said you don't count them, but they're still raid bosses. The only tie-in to PvP was that it was gated behind a PvP experience - in which you didn't have to participate yourself. Also, they could drop PvP gear in addition to normal raid gear.</div></div><hr />

Fair enough reasoning. Others might include Sartharion's extra encounters, making his number four, and I'd be sympathetic to that, too.<br />
<br />
The reason I'm not counting yours is because they're not part of the tier/PvE approach (an argument that could be made about Onyxia, it's worth noting...).</div></div><hr />

Honorbound rep is the easiest rep to get in BfA after 8.1 came live. Just do Assaults and Warfront dailies, and you will get exalted in a matter of days.<br />
I get lots of Honorbound 10k rep caches to get the 20 medal bonus for the 750 medal mounts. I get one Honorbound cache for 10k rep (at least) once every week.<br />

i mean again i get why people would buy the game cuz flying.. because they have no idea if the game is any good(most likely) and flying sounds cool etc.<br />
<br />
but when you know what the game is all about and flying is the only thing that keeps you from resubbing then its fucking stupid<br />
<br />
like its fine to say that you prefer the game to have flying from the beginning, but you really dont lose much without it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably means last remaining lore villain from before WoW. Lore and storytelling have dropped in quality since WoW began.<br />
<br />
My guess is that either this team running the game is inept at using the resources that were given to them by the previous teams, or they are purposefully trying to do away with anything old because they think they can come up with better. The third option is that the expansion is so bad that it has to be propped up by a ham fisted throw-in of a classic character to get people to play it.</div></div><hr />

Two new zones, a raid, a mega dungeon, new main story quests, rework on the neck was promised right? Heroic warfronts sounds like what a lot of people were asking for, and some pvp stuff. <br />
<br />
Honestly sounds good, I just really hope it’s not all gated behind 10 weeks, with 5 quests to do per week in the new zones or something. That’d really spoil it. <br />
<br />
Also Vashj’ir is one of my favourite zones in the game so hopefully it’s got some nice visuals. <br />

<br />
When you get to a new zone, you have to attune to the weather currents to be able to fly there. There's a bunch of them scattered around the zone in manually picked spots, and some tied to main and side quests. This means you have to do the main story, a couple of side quests and explore the zone, then boom, you can fly there, you've seen and experienced the zone, now you can move as you wish.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gratlim</div><div class="date">2019-03-25, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You were still leveling through BG's? I thought that was removed a long time ago. I actually used to do that a lot until WoD<br />
<br />
Yeah there is still xp gains in BG. But in Legion they merged players with xp locked and those with xp unlocked. Making us able to get fast queues with levelers. They removed that in 8.1.5 though. So queues for xp locked twinks (19s, 29s etc.) are as good as dead (50min+ on EU to no pop - and that is for those most popular 19-29. The rest was shot dead by this patch).<br />
<br />
This was an undocumented change. Found out about it with 8.1.5 launch to my disgust. <br />
<br />
Mardux: I actually loved Legion from start to finish. So I was subbed all the way. Storywise / HLwise it was superior and exciting. While Twinks were more boring then (ilvl pvp template from Holinka), it didn't matter much because high level pve was good. I only unsubbed 3 times since BC prepatch when i started playing: Cataclysm early on (because of my raiding guild dying), WoD (early on but enjoyed the end of it) and now BFA. I have high hopes for 8.2 :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormykitten</div><div class="date">2019-03-25, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think in the end, my problem with the game is that it's designed itself out of fun. Like, it's quite balanced and stuff, it has a lot of functional things, but a lot of it is just not that exciting, including classes. They work well often, they are relatively balanced as often is the case, but it's so hard to find &quot;wow&quot; moments now. I mean, some of that is due to having played a long time, but what's kept me in the game other than social things is the everyday playing being quite enjoyable - it no longer has that, azerite traits feel very impersonal and silly and could have been any number of things related to your class that's just more exciting. Everything has the feel of going through the motions. Hopefully, 8.2 can work to fix some of all the things where the game has slipped or simply stagnated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With 3 months &quot;seasons&quot;, there is no way to have bigger raids anymore.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loveliest</div><div class="date">2019-03-27, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So basically you want Blizzard to craft an entire plethora of zones with intricate details and quests....but give you the option to ignore all of it with flying? Get over it lol.<br />
<br />
Like MoP? You know... nobody complained about flying existing in MoP yet now you all think this &quot;argument&quot; makes so much sense. In an MMO no less, that is based on repetition that is supposed to get easier with time.<br />

In general larger raids have been more enjoyable<br />
<br />
Says you. Big raids burn me out where we redo the first 10 bosses every week on farm to get to the next few. I prefer 7 boss raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only the Giblin make sense in that regard. An allied race always is a variation of an already existing playable race. The Makrura and Sea Giants would be totally new races. That's why it was always ridiculous that ppl pushed for vulpura and sethrak to be allied races.<br />

<br />
The landscapes are current content, so there should be no flying. With 8.2 we get a new area so the old area will have flying enabled. It's as you say but not like you want.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the tiny raid issue:<br />
Around 8 bosses is the optimal size because it can be too much. We all got older and some of us have responsibilities now and can't play every day for 7 hours. Also if you repeat the same things in your job you don't want that in your free time as well. I may have to stop raiding if Blizz brings out a raid that requires 4 raid days per ID.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, let me rephrase: Having more bosses in a raid tier has been more enjoyable (for me), especially since these were either split in multiple raids, had multiple progression paths, or had portals that unlocked after multiple kills to skip forward.<br />
<br />
Uldir and BoD are more exhausting for me as you can't skip forward, so you are stuck with extending lock-outs or reclearing the entire thing if you are progressing on a boss further in the instance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess is that either this team running the game is inept at using the resources that were given to them by the previous teams, or they are purposefully trying to do away with anything old because they think they can come up with better. The third option is that the expansion is so bad that it has to be propped up by a ham fisted throw-in of a classic character to get people to play it.<br />
<br />
Buddy you need to educate yourself. Last remaining lore villian my ass, and thrall was always going to make a come back...He is basically the main character of warcraft lmao. Yall QQ to much. Everything that is happening lore wise makes sense and fits the characters lore.</div></div><hr />
