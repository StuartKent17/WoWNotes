Watch The Arena Championship and Earn the &quot;Patron of War&quot; Title!<br />
After battling their way through some intense qualifier cups, Europe’s top World of Warcraft Arena teams are ready to prove that they’re the best in the region. The Legion may have crashed into Azeroth since the last time they faced off, but these competitors will be ignoring the demon invasion in favor of PvP glory later this month.<br />
<br />
The World of Warcraft Arena European Regional Championship will take place in Kiev, Ukraine from Friday, September 30 to Sunday, October 2. We’re heading to one of the biggest esports venues in Europe, the Kiev CyberSport Arena, where eight teams will fight for a share of $100,000 USD. And that’s not all—the top three teams will also qualify for the 2016 World of Warcraft Arena Championship at BlizzCon 2016, where they’ll take on the best players from around the globe.<br />
<br />
Prizes<br />
The $100,000 USD prize pool will be distributed as shown below, and the top three teams will advance to the final stage of the 2016 Arena Championship at BlizzCon 2016!<br />

Patch 7.1 - Flight Path Map Changes<br />
The flight path map has been changed to show only the path to your destination in Patch 7.1, how many world quests are up in a zone, as well as showing non world quests on the map. Currently the flight points aren't lining up correctly with the Broken Isles map.<br />
<br />

What was the design philosophy behind the elite area of Suramar? It's super frustrating, even with a group.<br />
Agreed the spawning is too dense right now, but it's meant as a group combat area. Lots of Group Finder parties for WQs there. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/780103230265044992))</div></div><hr />

It was never intended to be a tank weapon. It became a tank weapon because the community made it a tank weapon, it's intent was to be used by Rogues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wouldn't be if higher ilvl (of the proper stats) were actually an upgrade to other classes. In fact, that would make everyone's life (except for those who like to theorycraft) a lot easier. <br />
<br />
It probably won't pick cloth items for plate wearers, though.</div></div><hr />

Jesus christ, you can't possibly be serious enough to live your life this way. It was hidden, and now it's not.

No one is crying here Angrys13. I gave a flat out honest respones and critique of what I think is shitty design, concept and execution of the greatest legendary item in game. Maybe I should of inserted a Pepe the Frog meme with &quot;Feels bad man&quot; attached to my post!?!<br />

No. But don't you think less than 1.5 potions for a Blood of Sargeras is a pretty poor rate?<br />
<br />
In MoP, we had Spirits of Harmony, which were basically the same thing as bloods. Although there were much better uses for spirits than herbs, if you went for herbs you got a guaranteed 20, possibly more. Pots in MoP cost two herbs each, so you got at least 10 pots per spirit, likely more. Flasks cost 4 common herbs and one Golden Lotus, so 1.2 spirits per flask, vs 4.3 bloods per flask.<br />
<br />
I couldn't sustain my raiding consumables on spirits in MoP either, but they were at least RELEVANT. I'll blow through my store of bloods so quickly that this trading system might as well not exist.<br />

No, wait, I need flasks as well. Three flasks... another 13 blood. 35 blood for one raid night.<br />

Wait, food as well! I give up. Thanks for trying, Blizz.<br />

Stop sucking and learn to play. You dont need to use flask or potions on the first pulls when everyone fails to stuff. You need to start using them when you die to enrage or healers being oom.<br />

They're giving the title out for watching either the European or US championships this year. You'll get it after the US championships have concluded, which is something like October 9th, so don't worry about it showing up until then.</div></div><hr />

They didn't lie, they said it was &quot;Working as intended&quot;. They never said it wasn't time-gated, and many people believed it would be. They said in this post that some steps still may be missing, but you need TWO drops, not just one. And the drop rate might be low, which means you'll have to farm for it.<br />
<br />
I get it, you wanted to be the first to find it, you enjoyed the hunt for it, only to find out that your time was wasted because it was time-gated.

So fucking true. It's impossible to describe how much I hate the current state of alchemy.

You seem like a very upset and confused person so I'll be polite and help you out. I learn a lot of things. I can't stop every single time I want to learn something new or else I'll never learn anything at all.

Quite the jump there from Rank 3 of crafting recipes to lack of content. Random luck on acquiring higher ranks of profession skills isn't &quot;content&quot;. I doubt someone would start complaining in any form because they got all their rank 3 within a few weeks of the expansion. I'm pretty sure most people would be relieved to have that done early on and not sit there hoping every time they craft a potion or a flask that this will be the time they get their rank 3.<br />

The thing is, why to stay on bank while all other professions have something valuable to craft with them...<br />
<br />
So from absolute useless they turned into just useless... <br />
<br />
What if they added a transmute once per day, using bloods and get a nice bunch of herbs with a chance for felwort?</div></div><hr />

One of the many things that make legion feel like &quot;Design by a comittee of investors&quot; instead of &quot;this is a great idea we had and hopefully our playerbase likes it&quot;</div></div><hr />

exactly, can't wait for this feature</div></div><hr />

They never said it wasn't time-gated, and many people believed it would be. They said in this post that some steps still may be missing, but you need TWO drops, not just one. And the drop rate might be low, which means you'll have to farm for it.<br />
<br />
I get it, you wanted to be the first to find it, you enjoyed the hunt for it, only to find out that your time was wasted because it was time-gated. It's nobody's fault but your own that you took the time to try to figure it out, knowing full-well that it was quite possibly time-gated.<br />
<br />
I simply gave a critique of what is shitting design. What are you raving about? Why are you trying to put words in my mouth? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You really need to get a life man honestly,because you really have a game addiction problem if you really get this mad over something in a GAME...<br />
<br />
<br />
What? Are you flaming now? I gave a critique of what I think is bad game design. Also how am I mad? Did I hashtag #angry or did I emote a mad face? You should read and stop the personal attacks!</div></div><hr />

Maybe if you would use less exclamation marks and stop flaming blizzard wouldn't think you're mad. Because the way you're writing here is the behaviour of a little child that just got their lollipop stolen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The whole reason tanks got a Thunderfury was because of aoe threat generation. Just because it was incidentally good aoe something does not mean that was the intended role of the item. <br />
<br />
Either way, Imma get me a thunderfury. U mad bro?<br />
<br />
Mad, at what? Why would i be mad, i don't get that shitty meme. Also the Artifact skin looks nothing alike the original, which is a shame really. I would love to see updated Classic weapons back in the game.</div></div><hr />
