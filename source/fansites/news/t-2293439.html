Blue Tweets<br />
2 questions - can Unsullied tokens turn into legendaries? &amp; will something else replace Nethershards as an invasion WQ reward?<br />
Yes, new token purchases can be legendary items.No, changes to Assaults and Nethershards aren't planned. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/902672437086531585))<br />

<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
&quot;Powercreep&quot; - do you think this is something that should be avoided by game designers, or is it just a harmless and/or natural part of game balance over time?<br />
I think to a large degree it’s inevitable. I don’t think it’s necessarily harmless, but it’s easy to see how it happens. <br />
<br />
If you have a game that lasts more than a year or so, you are probably introducing new content to that game, and presumably you want players to engage with that content. Maybe you’re making a new champion for your MOBA. Maybe you’re adding new gear to your dungeon. You want that champion and dungeon gear to be relevant. <br />
<br />
It’s a noble goal to make that champion gear different but not better, but that’s hard to land in practice. If they are just different, players may not think the switching cost to learn the new content to be worth it. It’s even possible as a developer that you know your game better now (partially because of the community of course) and you know how to make champions or gear that are more optimized and relevant to players.

This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Legion Live This Week!<br />
This time in 2016, we finally got to start our foray into the Broken Isles and take the fight to the Burning Legion! The first thing players did was embark on a scenario to obtain their artifact for their respective specialization. Then, they picked an assault point in one of the new zones to begin questing. At 101, players were able to begin completing missions in their class order hall. There were some features that did not launch with Legion though, such as the Emerald Nightmare raid and the Mythic+ dungeon system. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Patch 6.2.2 Live This Week!<br />
In late August 2016 as Draenor was winding down, there was a small patch that added mostly quality of life changes. It added flying to Draenor, catch-up mechanics for the legendary quest lines, Timewalking Rewards, and updates to Winter's Veil and Hallow's End! Additionally, this patch added several mounts and the Legion Collector's Edition rewards into the game files. We also saw an update to the mount collection achievement, adding the Heavenly Azure Cloud Serpent (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10355-lord-of-the-reins) for obtaining 300 mounts.<br />
<br />

<br />
Patch 5.4 Spawn of Galakras<br />
As patch 5.4 began to unfold on the PTR in late August 2013, we got a preview of the new mount for completing Glory of the Orgrimmar Raider (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8454-glory-of-the-orgrimmar-raider) within Siege of Orgrimmar. This achievement was able to be completed in Flex, Normal, or Heroic Difficulty. It was the first mount that was obtainable by doing the new Flex raid difficulty. Spawn of Galakras (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/148392-spawn-of-galakras) is still obtainable in the game by going back to Siege of Orgrimmar and completing the necessary achievements!<br />
<br />

<br />
Mists of Pandaria Raid Previews<br />
In the beginning of September 2012, Blizzard released a preview of the two MoP raids that would be available at launch. We got previews of the four boss raid, Terrace of the Endless Spring, and the six boss raid, Mogu'shan Vaults. These would be two of the three raids that would comprise the early stages of MoP raiding. You can still go back and obtain some of the titles they offer, such as Glory of the Pandaria Raider (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/6932-glory-of-the-pandaria-raider), and the mount off of Elegon (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87777-reins-of-the-astral-cloud-serpent)!<br />

Did they forget they have a &quot;legacy achievement&quot; section now? Part of History should be changed into one. There's zero point in handing it out to everyone just for hitting max level; that's not what the achievement is for.<br />
<br />
No, but the achievement is tied to the artifact appearance.</div></div><hr />
