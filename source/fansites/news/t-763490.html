The 3rd part of the prologue is available for testings and things are getting very serious, Stormwind and Orgrimmar are attacked by elementals every 1~2 hours! This event is pretty fun and a lot less annoying than the WotLK's zombie invasion, if you do not want to participate in the event you should stay alive without too much problem. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Guards will try to evacuate citizens, low level players can also use portals to leave the city before the attack. <br />
You first have to barricade Stormwind/Orgrimmar to help defending the city. <br />
You will then have to defeat the elementals in all the districts of the city, Orgrimmar is damaged badly in the process and most of the buildings are on fire. <br />
After succesfully defending the cities, you will get a chance to counter attack by entering the huge portal in capital cities (or using the LFD tool) to fight mini-bosses in 4 different instances. <br />
The 4 bosses are Grand Ambassador Flamelash in BRD, Crown Princess Theradras in Maraudon, Kai'ju Gahz'rilla in Zul'Farrak and Prince Sarsarun in AQ20. <br />

New Tinkertown and the Fight for Gnomeregan<br />
As Gnomeregan's exiles set out to reclaim their beloved capital from the treasonous Mekgineer Thermaplugg, we bring you a first look at how this wondrous techno-city will exist in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. Following the conclusion of Operation: Gnomeregan, High Tinker Mekkatorque and his people have gained a foothold just outside the city in New Tinkertown. Soon, though, they'll find that the surface is rife with a host of new perils that they couldn't have prepared for.<br />
<br />
Resolute in reclaiming their lost capital, Gnomeregan's exiles have begun an assault against the traitorous Mekgineer Thermaplugg. Traveling from their temporary residence in Ironforge, they are led by the esteemed High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque, leader of the gnomes, and seek to restore Gnomeregan to its past glory. In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, new gnome adventurers will get to experience this ongoing struggle to retake their former home firsthand, beginning their journey in the besieged upper levels of the techno-city.<br />
<br />
In the wake of Operation: Gnomeregan, survivors of the fallout will make their way to New Tinkertown, the gnomes' foothold outside their captured city. From there they will be called into action by the high tinker himself to help protect reclaimed gnomish land from new and imminent threats. As one of the newest recruits to this cause, your mettle will be put to the test when you face perilous trials like rescuing captured gnomish demolitionists, destroying a tunnel riddled with vicious troggs, and extinguishing toxic sludge that has begun to rise from the irradiated depths of the city.<br />
<br />
Your most important mission, however, will be to thwart the plans of Razlo Crushcog, conspirator and ally of Mekgineer Thermaplugg. Before Chill Breeze Valley can be fully resettled, Crushcog must be stopped, and only your efforts can bring that goal to fruition. Gnomish know-how and engineering will be your allies, but your greatest weapons will be your wits and the will to fight the good fight... for Gnomeregan!<br />
<br />
In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, you'll encounter these challenges and more in the gnomes' new starting (levels 1-5) experience. Keep a good head on your shoulders and ingenuity in your pocket, and your contributions will help secure a proper home for your fellow gnomes.<br />

Mobile Armory Update - 3D Model Viewer<br />
Every character profile on the Mobile Armory now has a 3D model viewer displaying that character as he or she appears in-game, including equipped items and appearance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Simply touch and drag the character model to rotate it.<br />
Tap the icon on the top right to switch to a full-screen mode. In this mode, you can view a selection of character animations from the menu at the bottom of the screen. Other full-screen options include selecting a background, toggling the character’s helm and tabard display, and taking a screenshot (which saves to your Camera Roll).<br />
Tap the icon to the upper left of the character model to switch between viewing the 3D model and displaying character information.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other additions in this update include:<br />
<br />
<br />
A character's in-game activity (including item acquisitions, achievements, and boss kills), is now captured in an activity feed. You can display this feed by using the drop-down menu at the top of a character profile.<br />
Professions (both primary and secondary) are now displayed on character profiles and are accessed by the same character profile drop-down menu.<br />
At-a-glance item rarities: Item icons now have colored borders indicating their rarity.<br />
iPhone OS 4.0 optimizations and enhancements.<br />

Its probably the same as the beta. You need to go to Dalaran to buy Azerothian Flying to be able to fly in kalimdor/eastern, and im also guessing that skill isn't available to the people on the PTR.</div></div><hr />

RS is sort of Cata prologue. Like, they could also have introduced a troll raid in Gundrak, but introducing RS kills two flies in one hit. It's a content filler and at the same time it's also related to the incoming content.</div></div><hr />

Once the second city is freed you can queue for the other two elemental bosses. You can do these bosses once per event, so wait 1-2 hours and you can kill them again. The quests related to killing them seems to be 1 time only, or perhaps the first kill of the day. My favorite is &quot;Earth Girls Aren't So Easy&quot; for Crown Princess Theradras.</div></div><hr />

As far as I am aware, RS was there to clearly show the power of the Black dragon flight, so that when cata and Deathwing come out, nobody goes : &quot;who?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure, it was a nice content filler, but it just happens to be a black dragon, when the black dragon flight had pretty much nothing to do in WotLK<br />

Ruby Sanctum was not a world event, not to mention you forgot the Doomsayers part. If you include Ruby Sanctum, this is part 4. If you don't, this is part 3.<br />
<br />
The doomsayers is considered to be part of part 3 ( ie: the attack and doomsayers is only one part )<br />

This stuff is intended to be released before cataclysm, I forget, is defense disappearing in the 4.0.1 patch that removes armor pen, and impliments the new talent trees?<br />

I hope it is soon. If not next week then the first week in October. They can't have these events too short as not all people can be online every day of the week. I also think there is much more to come after this as someone from Blizz said things are going to become very chaotic (just like the zombie invasion) in the last days before launch.</div></div><hr />

Sure, it was a nice content filler, but it just happens to be a black dragon, when the black dragon flight had pretty much nothing to do in WotLK <br />

for WotLK there was the Arcanite Ripper(/Use guitar solo), the Argent Warhorn (calls a paladin to help you, then he Bubble Hearths away), the Vampiric Bat pet.<br />

This is going to be bigger than the WOTLK event. I for one cannot wait to see many many gold selling level ones, be killed by elementals, and also many many low levels portalling to safety. ;)<br />

I'm beginning to question a November release. I'd be shocked at an early November release (Like Boub predicted) at this point. Remember that they need a minimum of two weeks after Beta ends to press and ship DVDs. It's nearly the end of September. I don't see Blizzard doing a &quot;OK, beta's ending today, expect disks in two-weeks!&quot; kind of thing. They'll want some time to make announcements, etc. It's still *possible*, but I think it's increasingly unlikely (almost to the point of zero for a very early November release). <br />
<br />
Actually Halion is a Twilight dragon, not a Black dragon. The Twilight Dragonflight have served the Black Dragonflight since their creation.<br />
Technically OP was wrong to say &quot;it's a black dragon&quot;, but it is the Black Dragonflight that instigated this and seems to be calling the shots. Other than Halion, all the other beasties we fight are Black Dragons or Black Dragonkin. The basic theory of &quot;they did this to get the Black Dragonflight back into the front of our thoughts&quot; still stands.</div></div><hr />

From the other side, now situation is critical. In our guild attendance is around 20% for last months. ICC goes for record as the most longest avaible content. During Black Temple we had analogical situation, but it was 7 month (or more?) before Sunwell. Now they can hit one year :)<br />

I'm questioning the November 2nd release as well. However they don't need those two weeks. They can press the DVDs today if they wanted and they'd just patch stuff in as needed. I'm pretty sure the last betas were continuing right up to the release of the expansions.<br />

Yes but this shield is on the PTR where Defense has already been converted into another stat, so it doesn't make sense. The Holy Pally item there has Spirit so this shield obviously slipped through the cracks.</div></div><hr />

In case you missed it, holy paladins get Meditation (regen from spirit while casting) as one of spec bonuses, just like every other healer now. We kinda need it now that divine plea has been nerfed into the ground (right now on PTR/Beta its only like 10-15% mana and still has the healing penalty). Spirit has been tacked onto everything that used to have MP5 on it, because every healer can now make use of spirit.</div></div><hr />

Wrath Beta ended Nov 4th and release date was the 13th. So they didn't take a full two weeks, but it wasn't instant either.<br />

As someone with two prot paladins and a resto shaman, I'm not complaining. While the extra armor a shield provides is nice for resto/elem shamans and holy paladins, protection warriors and paladins absolutely need a shield in the offhand slot.</div></div><hr />

I seriously hope this isn't the full loot list. There's no resto/ele mail besides the obvious lack of a spell shield. Every other spec gets something specific but resto/ele shamans. They just get the neck and ring which every other caster/healer class can use, too. There's no healer, strength DPS, or tanking cape, either. So does kind of beg the question if there's some loot missing or Blizzard just &quot;forgot&quot;. &gt;.&gt; If they didn't want to itemize for the missing items like the spell shield, then they shouldn't be adding the items they do have like the tank shield. Equality is hardly a lot to ask for when it's just a few items compared to what they have added. A spell shield and something like mail caster boots or mail caster belt. Hardly a lot to ask for compared to what has been added.</div></div><hr />

It'd be a lot more interesting if everything was calm following the Lich King's defeat, and then a few days before the actual game is released, Deathwing's reemergence then threw things into chaos. Cutscene followed by massive chaos and then all this other stuff happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
whines like yours is what wrecked the game to what it is now.<br />
<br />
Wow thats a pretty good idea (totally serious)<br />
<br />
I don't understand why people are concerned about gear that will get replaced 1-2weeks after they get it. Be content with whatever ilvl gear you have, I'd rather get &quot;fun&quot; gimmicky items instead. Because those won't be made obsolete when cata hits.</div></div><hr />

It's been old for months now. In fact, I'm surprised everything in the game isn't covered with a layer of dust.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riboflavin</div><div class="date">2010-09-23, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sokarthetank as it is on the ptr you can only queue for the bosses of the cities that have been freed from the invasion, once the second city is free you can queue for the other two, you can only do one kill of each boss per the invasion stage, so you can kill them multiple times, however you have to wait for the final phase again. This is on the ptr though and I have no idea if this is what will happen on live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot less annoying means a lot less fun, that's what it means, it means you just attack stuff, kill a random enemy in an instance, and then do some meaningless quests.<br />
<br />
The entire thing is up for watching and it looks boring as hell, the zombie invasion was hours of fun, I literally stopped getting ready for Wrath just to do it every single day, hordes of zombie-players assaulting cities together and battling for control, it was as close to some kind of world-PvP as I've ever seen a game get.<br />
<br />
The zombie invasion was balls to the wall amazing and one of Blizz's greatest &quot;fun&quot; achievements.<br />
<br />
This? This is boring, confined, and with a minimalist quest line to &quot;complete&quot; the lore.<br />
<br />
I don't even care about it after actually seeing it and won't participate.<br />
<br />
&quot;New Tinkertown and the Fight for Gnomeregan&quot;<br />
<br />
So, you utterly fail in your goal and now they're set up OUTSIDE Gnomeregan in the area where nothing important ever happened, aside from a certain stealthed quest giver attempting to destroy the minutia of forces outside the actual city from within.<br />
<br />
I mean, really? This is it? They failed to achieve anything but a camp after all this hype, since it was first mentioned on MMO Champ? This is really all?<br />
<br />
I'm so disappointed I may just have to go as Ben Stein or Droopy Dog for Halloween, supreme levels of fail, Blizz, the only saving grace of these two total-fails is that the Gnomes will have their own starting point and(I assume) very funny quests associated with it.<br />
<br />
The content of Cata is definitely going to be great, but the kickoff is as weak and lame as BC's.</div></div><hr />

I agree with every single thing you have said about the zombie event, really well described. But the truth is, it was so great, nothing is going to look good compared to it, you know? <br />
<br />
But, you can't possibly say this even will be alike the BC one, it's got a lot more depht and stuff to do, though then again, nothing compared to zombie event.</div></div><hr />

I mean, come on... icc 25 non-hero already drops ilvl 264 loots, and everybody should be fully geared with it by now...<br />
<br />
I really see no reason to actually visit em once phase 4 hits...<br />
But on the other hand, the whole event is kinda sad with what i saw so far and NOT ecip at all.</div></div><hr />
