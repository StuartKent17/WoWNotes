Battle.net Preview<br />
An extensive preview of the new Battle.net is now available on Starcraft2.com (http://www.starcraft2.com/features/misc/battlenet.xml). Even if it's not completely WoW related, it will probably give you a small idea of what to expect on World of Warcraft in the future. <br />
Battle.net is about to undergo the greatest update in its long and storied history as one of the world's most successful online gaming services.<br />
<br />
Fully integrated, user-friendly, and fast, the all-new Battle.net makes it easy to find and play games, opening the world of online gaming to generations of players. In the 14 years since the original Battle.net’s launch, the service has seen tremendous growth both in terms of features and active players. Currently, there are more than 12 million active accounts on Battle.net worldwide.<br />
<br />
This raises an interesting question. If the original Battle.net was so successful, why change it? Updating a service like Battle.net is a hugely complex undertaking. Are there really that many new features that Blizzard Entertainment could offer that would deliver a world-class online gaming experience to its community?<br />
<br />
In one word: Yes.<br />
<br />
The list of past innovations integrated into the legacy Battle.net service is long and varied -- the introduction of competitive ladders, server-hosted games, online-stored characters, automated matchmaking, and more. But with the release of StarCraft II, Battle.net will evolve into an even more powerful and advanced online game service that will power all Blizzard Entertainment titles moving forward.<br />
<br />
The final metamorphosis has only just begun....<br />
<br />
The Always-Connected Experience<br />
In the past, Battle.net was presented as a multiplayer option off to the side, off of the main menu of Blizzard Entertainment titles. That is all changing. With the new Battle.net experience, the service and the game are now interwoven into one experience. Whether you are in single-player or multiplayer StarCraft II, you are always connected, and enjoy a bevy of new and enhanced functionality.<br />
<br />
Battle.net and StarCraft II are designed to be seamlessly connected. That means even if you're playing solo you will still view the latest news, receive game and content updates, and be able to see your friends' status and chat with them. But this new interconnectivity between the game and the service goes even deeper than that. Now, each player will create a StarCraft II Battle.net character. This character serves as your single persistent identity across the service. Everything you do in the game -- win/loss record, achievements, unlockable rewards, friends list, and more -- will be saved to your character profile for you and your friends to see. Even your save game progress in the campaign can be synched to Battle.net. Say you upgrade your computer and re-install the game; once you connect to Battle.net, you can continue the campaign right where you left off. This is especially useful if you play on more than one computer, because all your data will be carried over for you via Battle.net.<br />
<br />
Competitive Arena For Everyone<br />
One of the biggest improvements that the new Battle.net service brings to StarCraft II is smarter and more accurate matchmaking. While the legacy Battle.net service had good matchmaking, the standard experience for new players was usually a series of crushing defeats against seasoned Battle.net veterans until they either left or developed the skills necessary to thrive in Battle.net's competitive environment.<br />
<br />
The new Battle.net matchmaking service will measure player skill more accurately than ever before, making online competitive play more accessible for a wider audience. What’s more, we are introducing an all-new Battle.net Leagues and Ladders System to the service. After using the auto-matchmaking system a few times, Battle.net will automatically slot you into a league and division that best suits your skill level. Our goal here is to encourage local competition by finding you a neighborhood of 100 players of equal skill against whom you will be ranked. This will make ranked online play much more enjoyable and give everyone a realistic chance to win their division.<br />
<br />
Beyond ranked matches, Battle.net will also make it much easier to compete by offering a number of other game modes. Custom games will of course make their return, but there will also be a slew of new, casual-friendly game modes such as the Practice League, Co-op Versus AI (players versus the computer), Challenges, and more.<br />
<br />
Connecting The Blizzard Community<br />
Battle.net's social networking and communication capabilities will be some of the service's biggest new features. This new social backbone for the entire service will seamlessly integrate friends lists, matchmaking, messaging, and more. Text and voice chat are now seamlessly interwoven into and out of the game, enabling communication whether you are in Battle.net or in-game playing StarCraft II. And as is the case with previous Blizzard Entertainment titles, you can form friendships with other characters on Battle.net while preserving your anonymity.<br />
<br />
With the new Battle.net, we’re also introducing an entirely new concept called Real ID. With the Real ID feature, you are able to send invites and form friendships on Battle.net with your real-life friends and family. Real ID friends are mutual, which means that both sides need to agree to the friend request. Forming Real ID friends comes with its benefits. You will see your Real ID friends by their real name, along with any character they are logged in as. You will also be able to get rich presence information about what they are doing, send broadcast messages, and communicate cross-game between StarCraft II, Battle.net, and World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
And of course, Real ID is totally optional. By enabling this, you can set up your Blizzard Entertainment social network, communicate and play games, and best of all, carry your network forward to future Blizzard Entertainment titles.<br />
<br />
Mods and Community-Created Content<br />
With a community as dedicated and as creative as that of our players, the abundance of exceptional community-created mods is no surprise. When the legacy Battle.net service introduced support for user-created mods such as DotA, Tower Defense, and many others, these user-created game types became immensely popular. But while Battle.net supported mods at a basic level, integration with tools and the mod community wasn’t where it needed to be for a game releasing in 2010.<br />
<br />
The new Battle.net service will see some major improvements in this area. StarCraft II will include a full-featured content-creation toolkit -- the same tools used by the StarCraft II design team to create the single-player campaign. To fully harness the community's mapmaking prowess, Battle.net will introduce a feature called Map Publishing. Map Publishing will let users upload their maps to the service and share them with the rest of the community immediately on the service. This also ties in with the goal of making Battle.net an always-connected experience -- you can publish, browse, and download maps directly via the Battle.net client. Finding games based on specific mods will also be much easier with our all-new custom game system, placing the full breadth of the modding community's efforts at your fingertips.<br />
<br />
Sometime after the release of StarCraft II, modders will have access to an even more advanced means of sharing their work via Battle.net with the StarCraft II Marketplace. With the StarCraft II Marketplace, players will be able to browse, download, rate, comment on, and even buy mods if their creators choose to put a price tag on their work. We strongly believe that providing content creators with the option of being compensated for their work will lead to some truly amazing projects; having a budget will give modders much more freedom to explore and fully realize all their ideas. This in turn will lead to a bigger selection of mods and a greater variety of content on Battle.net. <br />

I assume you are too young to have played starcraft use map settings or warcraft 3 custom maps? Blizzard always make insanely useful map editors.<br />

<br />
^ This. My friends play on the same server, but a few have gone horde recently. I made a toon too, but I still spend most of my time on Alliance side. It'd be cool to chat with friends cross-faction with this change.<br />

<br />
You are now connected to battle.net for single and multiplayer games. This is similar to steam. This is to prevent piracy. This is going to keep you from lending your copy of warcraft2 to a buddy so he can try it out. This is going to keep you from being able to play your single player campaign in starcraft 2 if your internet goes out.<br />
<br />
Before you can access a single player game, you have to connect to the internet, if you have no internet connection, battlenet cannot verify you, and you cannont play.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pinkduck</div><div class="date">2010-02-10, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not usually very critical of this type of thing... But the marketing buzz surrounding the new battle.net makes it sound like this kind of thing is brand new and a massive innovation. Valve did this years ago with Steam, and lately it seems everyone's been playing catch-up. But even Steam is not particularly amazing. It's nice that I'll be able to keep in touch with my friends cross-server while in game, but this is something I've been doing for years anyway with msn/aim/skype/xfire/whatever. The integrated &quot;experience&quot; is just more of the same as Steam, and doesn't offer much over the IM's we've been using for years. When battle.net meets wow and we get to chat cross-game, it won't change much of anything. When it does, if it let me raid with my friends on another server while being on my current one, now that might be something worthwhile. Or maybe if it let me play D3 or SCII in single player until LFG's ready. That'd be neat. But I'm not expecting that at all.<br />
<br />
What this boils down to is Blizzard finding a way to provide stronger copy control and access to their games via a Steam/EA-style subscription service model. It's to reduce piracy, not to improve the user experience. Granted, digital content delivery is slightly more attractive than going out to the store to buy a game (most times anyway), but losing the ability to play your games if Blizzard shuts down, and being unable to play your games when not connected to the Internet (like HL2 at one point) is kind of shitty.</div></div><hr />

Given that there's only 7 million players tops still playing WoW. The extra 4 mil they also got by &quot;forcing player to sign up&quot; is pretty impressive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are now connected to battle.net for single and multiplayer games. This is similar to steam. This is to prevent piracy. This is going to keep you from lending your copy of warcraft2 to a buddy so he can try it out. This is going to keep you from being able to play your single player campaign in starcraft 2 if your internet goes out.<br />
<br />
Before you can access a single player game, you have to connect to the internet, if you have no internet connection, battlenet cannot verify you, and you cannont play. This is the single worst feature of steam and why I hate it, despite all its good features. I live in a remote area with a shoddy internet connection, and when my internet goes out, I like to at least be able to play single player games. This prevents that.<br />

<br />
First, where exactly is it stated that you HAVE to be connected? I can understand if they do that for SC2 at an install level, but they definitely won't retroactively force you to be connected to battle.net for WC 1-3, SC1, and Diablo 1-2. It's doubtful they'll force it upon you for SC2 and Diablo 3 as well, if only because Blizzard is NOT Valve<br />
<br />
Second, am I the only one who gets the feeling that this screenshot:<br />

seems to be almost from SC1 with an SC2 interface overlay, and maybe an SC2 overlord? Just seems a little... off to me<br />
<br />
Edit: I'm not saying that that's definitely not SC2, it could be simply lighting playing a trick on the eyes, in fact it probably is. Just thought I'd ask if it did the same to others. :D</div></div><hr />

Battle.net is, in essence, a free service, so I doubt that very much. It is entirely possible that blizzard will change this, but there are many people who play Starcraft and Warcraft on a regular basis, who simply don't want to pay for a service they've had for ages. And despite some people's opinions to the contrary, Blizzard does care about it's customers (albeit a &quot;bit&quot; less since a certain evil merger) and I doubt they'll disappoint us by asking for payment for battle.net.</div></div><hr />

Does anyone else find it odd how Blizzard intends on allowing StarCraft modders to sell their work? Well, I guess it wouldn't be odd until you remember that they fairly recently banned WoW AddOn authors from selling their AddOns.<br />

<br />
<br />
I can at least somewhat understand the logic behind this. WoW Add-ons are simply changes to the UI, and they likely feel that players shouldn't be charged for such. SC2 mods can be much more than simply UI changes, they can be new maps, and even entirely new campaigns. They may allow mods that do more than this, which could potentially be a lot more time consuming and a lot more hard work than the UI add-ons we get with WoW. I don't like that they allow it, because I'm sure there'll be some badass mods out there that cost money. But if they're really that great, I suppose I can stand to shell out a few bucks for them. I suppose we'll see how this all turns out though.</div></div><hr />

Don't quote me on it, but I believe they said something like this on Blizzcon'09:<br />
Both players have to accept the friendlist invite, if someone for example invites you, but you don't want them on your friendlist, he/she won't show up on your friendlist and neither will you on theirs<br />
<br />

Another thing about the video:<br />
Does that screen at 0.40 saying &quot;Welcome to the Starcraft 2 Beta&quot; either mean that there already is a beta running, or maybe that there will be one soon™ ?<br />

Actually - I love this feature already.<br />
Especially when Diablo 3 and future battle.net games come out, you'll start seeing the purpose of it I guess. ;-)<br />
<br />
I have many gamer friends, and keeping in touch in game is easier than alt-tabbing all the time just to see if their arena team is done and if they're up for a Diablo run (just an example).<br />
<br />
You can also see on which alt your friends are playing, great since I don't remember all my friends’ alts! <br />

Having a common friend list almost gives a feeling that you're playing the same game as your friend(s). This will be enough for some to buy SC2 and still play the hell out of WoW because their friends are right next door. As silly as it sounds.<br />
<br />
There's many other reasons, but I must say, I was waiting for one of those move that they'd pull to keep a high subs number on their cash cow with the release of SC2.</div></div><hr />

So everyone were expecting todays news and what does blizzard do - they announce features! FEATURES !!! that were announced and told about in last Blizzcon....that is all - what does this do? It creates new hype and excitment. So what blizzard really did is - yet again failed to bring us the beta start. didnt give ANYTHING new. But yet we are all jolly happy...

As for me, it boils down to one big 'if'<br />
IF: I can play SC2 while not connected to the internet, then I'm fine with the new features (not excited, just ok with).<br />

In your case that would be a combination of an asshat and a donkey hat, for you have to be quite stupid to make that comment, as well as stop reading at the first line. Point: Blizzard could see &quot;porn you're looking at&quot; ever since they made warden into what it is today. Frankly, I don't care. Neither do most people who play the game, as blizzard GM's who are tasked to combat cheating are unlikely to be people I'll ever meet in real life.<br />

I imagine that for the Real ID either you personally will set the name you want others to associate with yourself or when the person adds you as a friend (and you accept) they will enter the name they want to use to associate with you. I highly doubt it would be your real name.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nomadder</div><div class="date">2010-02-10, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can at least somewhat understand the logic behind this. WoW Add-ons are simply changes to the UI, and they likely feel that players shouldn't be charged for such. SC2 mods can be much more than simply UI changes, they can be new maps, and even entirely new campaigns. They may allow mods that do more than this, which could potentially be a lot more time consuming and a lot more hard work than the UI add-ons we get with WoW. I don't like that they allow it, because I'm sure there'll be some badass mods out there that cost money. But if they're really that great, I suppose I can stand to shell out a few bucks for them. I suppose we'll see how this all turns out though.<br />
While I don't know all of the details behind the system, I still think that you are making an unfair comparison here. Yes, a mod can be much more than simply a UI change - but that doesn't mean it will be. Many of the mods made for SC and WC3 were made using the default tileset: resources provided by Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Aside from the graphical aspect of the mod (which may or may not use any custom made textures or models), there is then the programming aspect of the mod, for programming triggers, etc. If we assume that you can sell a mod that was simply made with the default resources, then you are claiming that SC2 scripting &gt; WoW scripting in such a way that SC2 scripting is worthy of a return on investment, and WoW scripting is not. Which again, isn't really logical.<br />
<br />
As for SC2 mods being more time consuming and requiring more work to make; I take offense to this as both a WoW AddOn author and a professional game developer. Programming can be just as much hard work and as time consuming. Look at the game AddOns like Bejeweled and Peggle. Those use graphics and other resources created by a staff in an actual company. The work that went into the graphics is exactly the same as whether or not it is a WoW AddOn or a full game. Should PopCap not be allowed to sell their game in any medium because more work goes into other games?<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that both SC2 mods and WoW AddOns can be time consuming and require hard work. You cannot definitively say that a SC2 mod will always be more time consuming and require more hard work to create. Remember, there are WoW AddOns that have been developed and supported for five years now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are now connected to battle.net for single and multiplayer games. This is similar to steam. This is to prevent piracy. This is going to keep you from lending your copy of warcraft2 to a buddy so he can try it out. This is going to keep you from being able to play your single player campaign in starcraft 2 if your internet goes out.<br />
<br />
Before you can access a single player game, you have to connect to the internet, if you have no internet connection, battlenet cannot verify you, and you cannont play. This is the single worst feature of steam and why I hate it, despite all its good features. I live in a remote area with a shoddy internet connection, and when my internet goes out, I like to at least be able to play single player games. This prevents that.<br />

The last time I played a Steam game (admittedly a long time ago) the only way to play a Steam game off-line was to BE off-line. ie..

You will be able to play any single player aspect of the game without the internet. But there is no Lan, only battle.net if that was a question on your mind, and the no Lan is to prevent people from pirating the multilayer aspect of the game which probably had 100% more work put into it for balancing and such.</div></div><hr />

I can see the true ID coming out sooner than SC2 they are just polishing it. The only concern of mine is when people are on alts you will always know, so if your trying to dodge a raid you don't want to do on an alt you cannot anymore. This could cause a lot of guild drama for many. I hope there's an offline mode so even if your in game you can appear offline to not be bothered by anyone.</div></div><hr />

funny how you say you have &quot;zero interest&quot; in showing people what is goin on in your armory.I wonder what interest you yourself would have in anothers armory? if none then you have nothing to worry about.In short: sure i can take a look at your armory and see what achieves you did , what will that do for me? isnt that like 1-2 min of my life wasted looking up some pointless stats ?<br />
<br />
ow and what do you mean mean an offline mode where no one can track you ? you really sound kinda paranoid lol. I can assure you that &quot;the people not trying to track you are also not out to get you&quot;.Most and a mean pretty much all online games don't really pose any indentity risks to anyone online unless you purposefuly give out personal details like your real name ssn, etc.Your paranoya may play well for those hell bent on curbing internet freedoms and promoting censorship, those fellash do grasp at straws so don't give em an inch.<br />
<br />
On a more serious note i am all for an offline mode.Because when i do buy something from the supermarket i do wanna own something, as per just &quot;renting it&quot; from the company.Being able to enjoy the game offline as well as off would indeed be a big plus, i already think blizz is makin prob a little too much money off of us for it's online content seeing as were so many and paying 15 dollars a month for such a long time, monthly sub needs to go down since most of it's customers do stay quite a while.</div></div><hr />

Many of them were extremely polite, friendly, and great players. I will enjoy hearing from them again in the future!<br />
<br />
I am on the fence with regard to cross realm raids, (this was NOT MENTIONED in the post, don't jump on me) and being able to invite anyone on your list. This would defeat the purpose of being in a city and looking for a group of people on your own realm/world to battle monsters with. However, retaining individual servers leaves many of them overcrowded and others barely populated. <br />
<br />
A better solution to those overcrowding problems would be -- possible incentives to transfer off, such as a gold amount or free transfer (it's about time for some more of them...). Free epic riding training. For any realm with transfers off, go ahead and lock it so nobody can gobble up the incentive and transfer back. <br />
<br />
Most of that has been discussed before...it's just it seems to me that the only thing holding back cross-realm raiding is that you won't be able to see &quot;so and so&quot; at the mailbox in Dalaran or at the bar in Stormwind after you finish beating up Deathwing together. <br />
<br />
This is all in future relation to the battle.net communications megahub that they are finishing up. I see cross-realm raiding as an idea Blizzard WILL tackle in the future......it's just a matter of time.</div></div><hr />

Yes, battle.net is still popular. No, there aren't just one million accounts, WoW accounts were not counted.<br />
<br />
Think about it: <br />
1) SC1 is still very popular because it's the most successful e-sport in existence (There's also even more people who play private servers who aren't counted, such as the very popular iCCup)<br />
2) There's still some people who enjoy the albeit dated gameplay of Diablo 2<br />
3) WarCraft 3 still has many people who play ladder, because it's the most competitve (semi-recent) RTS on the market<br />

What in hell's name are you so worried about? The only thing you mentioned in your first post is about the armory and people seeing your achievements. Are you really concerned with random people seeing what you do on your video game character, nonetheless care? The only people who could have access to any personal data would be Blizzard, and once again, do you think they care about anything other than cheating? It's like complaining about Modern Warfare 2 where people can see how many days I've played. Are you concerned about telling a friend or someone you know that you stopped playing a game, but then they can actually look at your achievements and can tell you were lying? Or how people call each other out on gear using the Armory? It seems like you are being whiny and paranoid for the sake of being whiny and paranoid.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard Entertainment president Michael Morhaime has revealed today that StarCraft II will enter closed beta later this month and is targeted for a mid-2010 release.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're slated to begin beta testing later this month. The beta test will be conducted on a global scale including thousands of testers from North America, Europe, Korea, Taiwan Australia, and New Zealand,&quot; he said during today's earnings conference call.<br />
<br />
&quot;We expect a tremendous response from our players and we're eager to enter this stage of development as we enter the final stretch before release,&quot; he continued, right before adding that Blizzard hopes the closed beta will generate &quot;excitement&quot; for the title PC gamers</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anyaka21</div><div class="date">2010-02-10, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anything that changes with battle.net make s me skeptical, especially when all they are doing is fluffing it and not improving security with the single biggest issue people have had since it begin, using your email address as a login.<br />
<br />
Add that, the only reason it's successful as it is is because they forced the WoW community to join or get out.<br />
<br />
That said, as have others, privacy and piracy are still huge issues that need to be worked with. Just think, if you get hacked, hackers will have access to your RealID, not only that, with cross realm chat, they'll even know when you're online. Also add that since it's a free service, how long is it going to be for RealID spam mail to happen while you're playing, or if you log on from your phone for hundreds of gold selling spam mail.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I do like the idea of cross server chat, and have friends that play on different servers. I'd also like the ability to form chat rooms cross server as well, I think battle.net can do this.<br />
<br />
But honestly, first and foremost, piracy and privacy issues need to be worked with. And calling it a huge success when you forced a community to bow to your will, is not my definition of success.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Does that mean we cannot play SC2 singleplayer unless we have an active internet connection?<br />
<br />
If I happen to have problems with my connection for a few hours (and that does happen once every few days) I won't even be able to play the campaign or skirmishes against AI?<br />
That would totally suck. Seriously.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't want my blizzard games to be completely locked when I'm offline, that would definitely stop me from buying SC2 and D3 (and yes, until now I was planning to buy both).<br />

Seems to be the popular thing to do to combat piracy. On the bright side, at least it isn't SecuROM limited installs BS. Their reasoning is that most of America has broadband now. But in the rare case where your Internet goes down and you can't even play singleplayer does bite.</div></div><hr />
