35+ Artifact Traits Disabled In Instanced PvP Until Legion PvP Season 3<br />
Character progression is a core element of World of Warcraft, and that includes PvP. In Legion, empowering your Artifact to become stronger is a key part of character progression. When Artifact Knowledge levels were low at the beginning of the expansion, we deactivated the 35+ Artifact Traits in instanced PvP to avoid having large power gaps when compared to players who hadn't made much progress on their Artifact yet.<br />
<br />
In Patch 7.1.5, we added several methods that allow players to catch up their Artifact progression very quickly. Brand new players can advance up to Artifact Knowledge level 15 without any research time, and existing players can mail Artifact Knowledge Compendiums to alts, which immediately bring them as high as level 20. At this point, the power gap between a player with 35+ traits in their Artifact and a player just starting out is significantly less of a concern, as the gap can be closed very rapidly. For those reasons, we felt that Patch 7.1.5 was the right time to re-open Artifact progression to PvPers who had already earned the first 34 traits.<br />
<br />
However, we did not communicate this change (and its purpose) with enough advance notice to allow players to effectively prepare for it. Furthermore, while the improvements in Patch 7.1.5 make it much easier to unlock those final traits for new players or alternate characters, they weren't available until today. While we still believe activating these traits is the correct choice for World of Warcraft PvP, the middle of an ongoing season is not the right time to make this change.<br />
<br />
As of a few minutes ago, we've applied a hotfix that once again disables the 35+ Artifact Traits in instanced PvP on North American and Oceanic servers. In other regions, this hotfix will be applied with the patch. The 35+ Artifact Traits will remain disabled for Legion PvP Season 2.<br />
<br />
Once Season 3 begins, we'll re-enable them. Note that Patch 7.2 will include some further expansions to the Artifact system that will make it highly valuable to have spent some Artifact Power on those traits (another reason we feel it's important that they be enabled in PvP). We'll have more details to share on those changes once Patch 7.2 has begun its public testing phase.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your feedback and understanding on this topic.<br />

Travel Form SpeedBug<br />
Can someone explain why they felt the need to nerf travel forms base speed from 200 to 180%?<br />
This is a bug and we currently have a hotfix in the works to resolve it. I'll update this thread if I hear anything more.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the heads up, and we appreciate your patience on this. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/792059-travel-form-nerf-trying-to-understand/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20752529464?page=3#49))<br />

Banning Botters<br />
Customer Support checking in - we definitely can and do continue to action bots. However, there might not always be landmark sweeps where thousands of voices suddenly cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced. These actions happen on a couple levels. <br />
<br />
Some are as simple as a Game Master investigating individual reports and we don't need more information on that particular system: we can close them down immediately. Other cases, we observe, monitor, and then detect/break the bot without needing player reports. Mass actions also occur, but those who barter and trade in illicit programs don't usually come to the WoW Forums to discuss it. <br />
<br />
There's a combined effort of normal checks/sweeps that our Hacks team do, the reports that are sent to Game Masters via right-click reporting, and other research on how these programs interact with our games where we attempt to break those methods outright. However, much like real life, the game of &quot;Good Guys vs. Bad Guys&quot; is an ongoing game. We build a mousetrap, they build a better mouse, we improve the mousetrap, etc. We aren't resting on our laurels, and continue to iterate and build new systems and pull new data to help us find and remove cheaters. <br />
<br />
If you see people exploiting bots/cheats in-game, let us know. You can also email us tips at Hacks@blizzard.com. In-game reports are best as it includes important information that players can't traditionally see (account details, play behavior information, etc), but where it's not possible the email is sufficient for us to kick off some research!<br />
<br />
Just to play counterpoint: <br />
<br />
Blizz doesn't need to &quot;collect info&quot; they have the info for the last 10 years. They could spend what...ten or twenty bucks to buy a bot account and get all that info in minutes. Its a cop out.<br />
This assumption is that bots haven't evolved in the 11 years we've been investigating/breaking them. There are a few botting companies who would strongly disagree with that assessment. Also, reverse-engineering a tool doesn't happen in minutes, whether you make the purchase or not. Debugging and reverse-engineering takes time, and then building reporting/detection around that also takes additional time. I can certainly understand your frustration, but I want to make sure it's tempered with realistic expectations. <br />
<br />
Bots and cheat programs will continue to exist in any game for as long as there's a market for it: unfortunately, players who buy gold or other RMT services encourage botting and compromised accounts whether they realize it or not. People bot for a variety of reasons, from small-scale boredom to organizations who run gold selling services. As long as those exist, we'll continue to keep weeding out and removing them from the community.<br />
<br />
You are certainly welcome to your opinion, but I won't let our actions and efforts be dismissed simply because you feel we're trying to scam or otherwise ignore our playerbase on the issue. Play Nice; Play Fair is one of the 8 core concepts of what we do, and hopefully some day we can convince you of that. <br />
<br />
I wish you well in your adventures, and we'll continue to clean up bots for if you choose to return. In the meantime, if you do encounter any cheaters in our games I encourage you to use the reporting methods available so we can take a look at them.

Patch Notes<br />
As long as I've been at blizzard (4 years) the patch notes haven't gone live until 6pmish the previous day. this is earlier.<br />
but ultimately, yes, a lot went wrong, which we're fixing for the 7.2 notes (including PTR notes) (Source (https://twitter.com/devolore/status/818586691510276097))<br />
The light of the tunnel is that part of the issue is due to some team restructuring which means future patch notes will be MUCH better<br />
We generally don't make promises but I can 100% promise this will not happen again. (Source (https://twitter.com/devolore/status/818692577121603584))<br />

Really Blizzard? Really? You just destroyed something that people actually enjoyed with the game. People that already got 54 traits and maybe even 54 in main/os pretty much got no reason whatsoever to do a mythic+ dungeon again except a small chance to recieve an item upgrade. We already started to stack up ap in mainweapon for traits coming in future patches and now you pretty much gave us nothing to do again except maybe farm on alts?

You might be able to stockpile somewhat around 30-35 m ap if u fill your bank and some slots in your bag. Thats nothing when ppl already got 50-60 m ap stockpiled in their ms weapon and next trait animation showed up after 9.9 m after 54. For people that find joy in it its not really pointless as all 3 weapons will be filled up within a couple of weeks. What then? Mailbox filled up constantly or destroying them for x months before 7.2? ...</div></div><hr />

I guess you don't understand the problem.<br />
<br />
I'm maxed on 54 traits as a prot paladin. I will never play ret or holy as they hold no interest for me. Up to now I have been able to stockpile AP by adding it to my weapon - now I have tokens that I can't activate.<br />
<br />
Even with 100 spare slots (bags and bank) a week of World Quests and Mythic + will totally max out any available space I have.<br />
<br />
At that point there is little or no reason to do anything that gains AP other than a weekly high level M+ for the chest and raids because I enjoy them.<br />
<br />
Prior to this I was able to activate the tokens and build a balance of AP for future use and felt that I was progressing towards the additional traits coming in 7.2.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that Blizzard has valid reasons for this change, unfortunately it removes any incentive I have to continue running content as it is no longer potential progression for my character.</div></div><hr />

Luckily people who do this are such a minority, it doesn't matter. I guess they don't want people to buy all the new traits and/or ranks on 7.2 launch day. It would be annoying in PvE, but it would completely screw over people in PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the thing people are forgetting: anyone could stockpile AP into a weapon prior to 7.1.5, but having stockpiled AP in a weapon is now an exclusive thing after 7.1.5. As it stands right now, Blizz just made the situation worse by having those that stockpiled AP past trait 54 have a head start when 7.2 goes live, and those that haven't begun to stockpile will always be behind because they are locked out. It's poor foresight, as they should've just had weapons stop accruing AP prior to 7.1.5 when news broke that someone maxed out their weapon already. At this point, I doubt Blizz would nuke the stockpiled AP in weapons, so I feel bad for those that didn't max out their weapon prior to this patch.<br />
<br />
*edit* - One of the previous posters is correct: there's going to be a point relatively soon where we are going to run out of places to dump AP. I'm a druid, so it'll take me a little longer, but I already have main spec 54 + extra stockpiled AP, along with most of my offspec weapons around 35. Funny thing is there are tons of people with more AP in their weapons than me. ;)</div></div><hr />

I had one bot that got banned in the November banware. Now I have two. You know what they say, cut one head, two new appear...<br />
I'm sitting on exactly 2.940.000g atm. Not many players are buying gold on my realm, which is bad for all of us. One WoW token cost €20, while 100k gold cost all from €5 to €8. That's 25-35% price of what it costs to buy from Blizzard directly. Or half the price of your sub. I can always unload gold to chinese who resell for higher but they usually buy for €3.5 - €4 per 100k. I prefer to find private buyers as I can then sell for about €6.5 per 100k. <br />
You earn €6 by what, working for 20 minutes? Imagine how long it takes to farm 100k gold. Besides, you guys are getting cheaper herbs for raid and I'm getting paid for doing nothing, win-win :D<br />
It's a video game, don't take the economy too serious. If you see a bot, don't report him. He's a modern Robin Hood.</div></div><hr />

We'll still do some, of course, but probably only enough to max our order hall chest. There are only a few of us in this situation atm, but it will become the norm by February.<br />

If we had any sympathy for botters, it would evaporate in our heat over the DDS attacks after each ban wave. Leave the game alone, and let those of us who are happy to play it the way Blizz intended enjoy our silly game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You REALLY need somebody to explain this to you? You can't figure out on your own why they don't want you to stockpile mass amounts of power toward future content? And yes, if you have maxed to 54, then you may have less incentive to do things that revolve specifically around AP ... but how many of those things are there anyway? The odd mission and WQ for AP? Everything else has another tangible benefit or potential benefit attached to it. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is the right decision by Blizz.</div></div><hr />
