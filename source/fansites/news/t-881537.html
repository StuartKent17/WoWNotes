The Firelands legendary weapon has an amazing story and quest chain associated with it.<br />
Account Bound items will be transferable to other realms &quot;some day&quot;. <br />
Blizzard wants to add more customizations to characters but isn't sure that dyes is the way to do it. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is a very interesting Q&amp;A, I suggest that you read the whole thing. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Is there any chance we could have caster weapons involved in casting animations? It would look cool to be holding a staff and casting a spell through it, at least as a customization option. - Dromanthis (NA/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: This is something we would dearly love to do. We agree that melee specs get to see their weapons a lot more often in combat while it's easy for casters to forget about them. It's definitely on the list, but understand that we have so many races now (and two sexes for all existing races) that the animations get expensive to produce.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Would it be possible for city quartermasters to sell the same equipment that guards wear? Stats wouldn't matter. - Pokemonmasta (EU|English), Tajit (NA/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: Cool idea. We'll talk about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Are you planning to return to the original principle of designing the Tiers, when the sets were themed with the classes, not with the bosses that drop them? Do you have any plans to make the tier items visually different depending on your spec? - Анви (EU|Russian), Trafalgarlaw (Latin America)<br />
<br />
A: We try and alternate the themes in order to keep things feeling fresh. Players can get bored if things feel too formulaic. The Firelands raid has a really strong theme, so the tier sets are based on the various creatures that live on the elemental plane: for example, fire spiders for the warlock set. Other tiers don’t have as strong a unifying theme so we go back to the classes for that. In the Call of the Crusade patch, we did faction-specific armor to solidify the military feel and Horde vs. Alliance rivalry.<br />
<br />
Varying tiers depending on spec is a cool idea, but it does add more work to the individual armor which usually means we’ll get less of it. Color shifts are one option, but tend to already use all of those. We have more unique art these days than ever before, but the number of items overall has grown tremendously faster.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: I like the creative items that are dropped from Icecrown Citadel such as Nibelung, Heartpierce, Deathbringer's Will. Can I see more of such items containing unique proc-effects in the near futuer? - Whitewnd (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: Yes. We think the procs are a good way from keeping the weapons from just feeling like a predictable bag of stats. There will be more in Firelands.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will enchanters be getting back the ability to make wands? - Trustybee (Taiwan)<br />
<br />
A: We have been discussing what role in the game wands are supposed to fill. We generally consider it a failure these days if a caster ever wants to wand for dps instead of using their spells. Working the wand into the cast animation (as in the question above) is one idea. In any event, we want to figure out what we want wands to do before we give them any more prominence.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Any chance we can start heading away from WWE-esque belts? - Catriona (NA/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: Azeroth is stricken by a terrible plague that inflates the size of shoulders and belts over time. Our artists like the belts because they have more room for detail when they’re larger. That said, your concern is duly noted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Do you have plans to make is so that the tabards don't suddenly cut off whenever we wear long vestments? - Hôwl (Latin America)<br />
<br />
A: This is a technical issue that’s fairly nasty to fix and ultimately trimming the tabard ended up looking better, at least as a short-term solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Can we see gear won via need rolls become soulbound? - Lorinall (NA/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: Yes. We plan on implementing a system where winning an item via Need (when using the Dungeon Finder Need Before Greed loot system) will make a BoE item soulbound. We hope to have this working for the 4.2 patch.<br />
<br />
To expand on that idea in case it’s not obvious, we don’t think players should be able to claim certain loot drops based on their class if their only intent is to sell the item. If you want to use the item yourself, awesome, go ahead and roll Need on it and you’ll get preference over players who can’t use that armor type. But if all you want to do is run to the Auction House, then everyone should have equal dibs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: How do you plan on normalizing Legendary weapon aquisition rate between 10 man and 25 man raids? If the drop rate is the same for 'shards' in 10 and 25 man raids, this may 'force' 25 man guilds to run 2-3 10 mans in order to maximize shard/legendary aquisition. If the drop rate for 'shards' in 25 man raids was 2.5 times than that in 10 man, it could take a 10 man guild say, 2.5 months to gain a legendary whereas a 25 man guild would take 1 month. - Deathsaint (NA/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: Our main goal is to offer the Legendary in both 10 and 25 without requiring say a 25-player raid to feel like they have to switch to running 10s for the sole purpose of Legendary fragment acquisition (and the same is true for 10s). Our plan is to make Legendary completion take longer to acquire in 10-player raids. The exact ratio will be somewhat obfuscated because of the variation in the amount of fragments dropped per boss based on both raid size and raid difficulty. However, you can plan on it being maybe 2 to 2.5 times faster for the 25-player raid. It should feel analogous to number of Valor points or gold dropped in 25s, and is being treated the same.<br />
<br />
Without giving too much away, the Firelands legendary weapon has an amazing story and quest chain associated with it. We think it truly delivers on the fantasy of a legendary weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: I feel that the current item drop ratio per part for caster's is little bit weird. While belt slot items are very common, wrist and ranged (wand) item are drastically rare. Now players don't like going to Throne of the Four Winds because belt and pants are so easily acquired via other way. What if the drops of Throne of the Four Winds changed into rare slot items, such as wrist and wand? - 빛그***제 (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: There are a few issues embedded in this question. One is that while we like the random nature of the Throne of the Four Winds gear overall, it occupies a strange niche in the current itemization scheme. Al'Akir for example is fairly challenging, but so are Cho'gall and Nefarian. The net result is that many players lack epic legs, heads or shoulders and so have a strong incentive to spend Valor Point on their tier set of legs. By the time they defeat Al'Akir, nobody wants his legs. We plan on tweaking those loot tables a little for 4.1; Al'Akir will drop some random necks and cloaks as well as helm or shoulder tokens in addition or in some cases instead of his current loot.<br />
<br />
As far as some items being rarer than others, that is the kind of thing we vary so that every tier of content doesn’t feel like a photocopy of the previous tier with bigger numbers. Our PvP gear for a variety of reasons has become very formulaic, and we don’t want the same thing to befall PvE. Bracers are hard to get now (though the trolls in 4.1 have a lot!), but next tier it might be a different item that becomes precious.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: What are the criteria you use to design the loots in a certain dungeon/ raid? Is it the backgrounds of the encounters, the preference of the designers, or basing on the existing models? - Kiolds (Taiwan)<br />
<br />
A: All of that and more. As in the question above, if the dungeon or raid has a really strong visual kit, then we definitely jump on that. When you consider say the Cataclysm dungeon tier, there was a really diverse set of environments with no strong unifying theme. We could have tried to plan ahead of time that say Corborus would drop a certain weapon so we should theme it like a ring worm. That kind of rigid planning though doesn’t allow us a lot of room to maneuver if we decide to add a boss, change the source of certain items or so on. Naming the items can come from a variety of sources. Sometimes we play off of the boss (Symbiotic Worm from Magmaw), but there are pop-culture references (License to Slay), inside jokes (Chestplate of Hubris), and words that just sounded appealing together (Battleplate of the Apocalypse). <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Is there any plan to allow Account Bound items to be transfer to other realms? This could really give meaning to the phrase &quot;Account Bound&quot;. - 텔레토*** (Korea), Деадхил (EU|Russian), Åtchøûm (EU|French), Tellua (NA/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: Yes. Some day. It will take a lot of programmer time to implement, but it’s something we want to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Is it possible to let the players create/edit their own looks? - Zed Loft (Taiwan), Vysha (NA/ANZ), Ráchel (EU|German)<br />
<br />
A: As we said in an earlier Q&amp;A, we definitely hear loud and clear from players that they want more customization for their character. This is something we want to provide, but we want to do it in the right way. Consider the Barber Shop feature. It lets you change your character's hair, but there’s not a lot of gameplay to it. We're not sure that feature really added a lot to the game in retrospect. Is WoW more fun for you now that you have a Barber Shop? Are you more likely to keep playing because of it? Maybe, but it wasn’t a cheap feature to add in terms of development time. Dumping a bunch of dyes on the game might have a similar effect, where some players might have fun playing around with the system for a bit, but a lot of players might change their colors once or twice and then forget about the feature after that. Now, not every aspect of the game needs a ton of depth and a lot of interesting decisions, but we tend to attract more players to a feature the more robust the feature is.<br />
<br />
We also think it's fair to argue that the game just needs more armor and weapon art. As we said above, we deliver a lot of art these days, but we also produce an enormous number of new items every expansion or patch and it’s understandably disappointing whenever items use the same art. It would be really cool if not every mage or priest converged on the same look after a given expansion or patch.</div></div><hr />

Did you even read the rest, they said in the Dungeon finder that would happen and second if you are doing a BoT trash run with 9 other people I seriously doubt you would be able to need a BOE drop above anyone else anyways.</div></div><hr />

I think at this point in time (until the race model/animation revamp at least), it's probably more feasible just to go with something similar to WAR's Trophy system. In that you have a couple of slots that you can equip trophies to, that are shown on your character with models/doodads. You could have things like medals, or skulls, or collars, or cape-hoods, and so on. You could even expand it to have special trophies drop for hard-mode kills, or achievements, or anything like that.</div></div><hr />

They already indirectly have a system like this, it's called heroic gear being a different color, and new/fun mounts :P<br />
<br />
I think the issue with the WAR system in Warcraft is that with all the different types of armor models, it may be too much effort to make sure the sockets on the gear show up properly. I mean, if they don't want to animate each staff/sword/dagger in a spellcasting animation, I doubt they would do this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heroic gear are, like you said, just recolours. There's no silhouette differences. Besides, heroic gear is hardly a customization choice. You wear heroic gear because it's better than normal mode gear. There's not really a choice in the matter, their use is determined by stats, not by looks. Mounts are either tied to achievement - so no limiting factor - or are extremely rare in and of themselves.<br />
<br />
And attached doodads aren't animated. They're fixed attachments to meshes. They would just need to set certain points for mesh to lock them on. The same way that weapons are attached to hands and not separately animated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're completely off on the dye comment. I hardly doubt the majority of players would &quot;forget it&quot; like the barbershop. You only get hair once, and you only chance when you feel like it, but with dyes, whenever you get a new piece of armor, you'll feel compeled to try new colors to match your current gear. It's a renewing system, not a &quot;one-time only deal&quot; like the barber shop, where you get your results once and that's it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Adding more gear that achieves the same thing would just mean more items that are disenchanted. While I wouldn't say no to having to choose between some axe with a dragon handle or a sword that made of ice, both being 2h dps with favorable stats... It would just delude the loot ables on bosses with more items that people don't need anymore, and then just be forgotten.<br />
<br />
That said, I think proc weapons would fix this. Having a weapon that's pure stats, and a weapon that has a proc (which would be more theoretical dps, but not totally reliable), makes more sense, loot-wise.</div></div><hr />

Expensive can mean more than money. If they only have X amount of animation artists, that is time away from other things that are more need to do. Unless you truly understand what they meant.

Nope. They hire more animation artists, and thus it costs more money. Expensive in this case means just what it means. They're lazy, they won't lose players because of a lack of animation, so a good enough answer for them is its to expensive/to hard. Same goes for the little snipe about the barbershop. They made a game where people would have the exact same looking character, that they had maybe 300 days played on if they raided in vanilla, and he makes a comment that makes it sound like in retrospect the barbershop was a bad idea because it took a little bit of their time to implement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, expensive in the context they use it means more than money (i.e. time and development). That is how it's referred to. And simply throwing money at something, such as hiring new animators to do a specific task, is not always the right solution. In fact, there are many downsides to doing just that, and the reason has nothing to do with laziness. The people who spout &quot;Blizzard is lazy, wah wah&quot; have no idea what they're talking about. I'm no Blizzard fanboy, but I can tell you your assumptions are way off, and it just seems like you're butthurt because you want something now, and you think you know how long it should take to develop something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A: Our main goal is to offer the Legendary in both 10 and 25 without requiring say a 25-player raid to feel like they have to switch to running 10s for the sole purpose of Legendary fragment acquisition (and the same is true for 10s).

<br />
Without giving too much away, the Firelands legendary weapon has an amazing story and quest chain associated with it. We think it truly delivers on the fantasy of a legendary weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
There has to be a better way to do this, seems kind of extreme for something so awesome. 25-players raids look better and better.<br />
<br />
Guess it fits ok. You split a 25 in, lets say, 2 10mans to grab 2 legendaries... do not let any format trumph the other, then they need to make 25man raids able to create 2 legendaries at the same time frame that 2 10man do. So, if it takes you to complete one in 3 months (so, 2 legendaries from 10man in 3 months), it takes 3 months to craft 2 in 25, but not at the same time, so the 1st guy is using his &quot;1 month and 15 days&quot; earlier, but both raids will get 2 at the same time.</div></div><hr />

Ppl think they just need to put a &quot;showweaponwhilecasting = true&quot; and we're good to go.<br />
<br />
Now imagine you hitting your head (clipping happens) with your gigant staff while you're casting waving your hands as a BE male?<br />
<br />
See? You'll need to come with a entire set of new animations, considering every single caster weapon model avaiable (from staffs to daggers or offhands) for each race and gender, while at the same time doesn't look stupid. You can't have the same animation with a staff and a sword + &quot;off-hand lamp&quot;... would be so pathetic that we all would prefer that they never created it.<br />
<br />
Would be stupid to have the &quot;lamp&quot; not hanging while you're waving your hands (since those kind of off-hands looks like they're always a fixed object that gravity doesn't pull down, doesn't matter the position they are held).<br />

Most of the animations that people are asking for are things that have already been implemented into other games.

You greed on it because you want to SELL it (hello, GREED!!!).<br />

You need on it because you want it for yourself, so it really doesn't matter if it become soulbound, right? RIGHT??? Or it does because you in fact don't really need it!?!<br />

So, if it was just a matter of copy/paste animations, wouldn't these ppl come here and say &quot;BLIZZARD COYOPASTE GAMEXXX ANIMTANOIONS!!! LAZY BSTRADES!&quot;???<br />

Btw, they'll never create unique models anymore since ppl want new stuff everyweek. Not worth to design a entire Tier 12 and associated generic off-set gear, with so many eye candy and personalization for each class/spec/ilvl when in a few months it will all become garbage that ppl won't care anymore...<br />

Also making it sound like they are disappointed with giving us something, no matter how long, or how many times we use it, is just as off.<br />

25 man guilds can make 2 10 man groups - 10 man guilds can't make a 25 man group because of lack of numbers (unless you're running 2-3 10 mans but then it's basically the same time to get the legendaries)<br />

25 man needs advantages over 10 man or people will just want to raid 10 man because it's easier to make groups for it. (which is why 25 gets more valor points, etc..)</div></div><hr />

25 man has that problem as well - 10 man just obviously has it more because they have less of each spec. 10 man can't have everything as good or better than 25 man or it will be pointless to raid 25.</div></div><hr />

They hire more animation artists, and thus it costs more money. Expensive in this case means just what it means. They're lazy, they won't lose players because of a lack of animation, so a good enough answer for them is its to expensive/to hard. Same goes for the little snipe about the barbershop. They made a game where people would have the exact same looking character, that they had maybe 300 days played on if they raided in vanilla, and he makes a comment that makes it sound like in retrospect the barbershop was a bad idea because it took a little bit of their time to implement.<br />

<br />
We agree. We certainly could have worded the sentence better, or at least provided more clarity on what &quot;expensive&quot; meant in the context of that specific response. In this case, it referred to time invested (as Sabiras properly deduced), not simply money spent. Animations are an important element of design, but they require a lot of time and attention to do well. <br />
<br />
I've gone ahead and made an edit to the original post to avoid further confusion, but I also wanted to call out why it was made. Thanks for the feedback, too! We really do appreciate this kind of constructive criticism, as it'll help us improve these Q&amp;As going forward. :)</div></div><hr />

It's faster, but in the end it's the same ratio. Otherwise guilds would swap to 2x10 to get twice the amount of legendary weapons.</div></div><hr />

A: Yes. We plan on implementing a system where winning an item via Need (when using the Dungeon Finder Need Before Greed loot system) will make a BoE item soulbound. We hope to have this working for the 4.2 patch.<br />
<br />
To expand on that idea in case it’s not obvious, we don’t think players should be able to claim certain loot drops based on their class if their only intent is to sell the item. If you want to use the item yourself, awesome, go ahead and roll Need on it and you’ll get preference over players who can’t use that armor type.

Our plan is to make Legendary completion take longer to acquire in 10-player raids. The exact ratio will be somewhat obfuscated because of the variation in the amount of fragments dropped per boss based on both raid size and raid difficulty. However, you can plan on it being maybe 2 to 2.5 times faster for the 25-player raid. It should feel analogous to number of Valor points or gold dropped in 25s, and is being treated the same.<br />
<br />
Isn't this kinda of hypocritical? Wouldn't I want to switch to running 25mans if I was in a 10man guild so that I could get the caster legendary quicker? Exactly what he just said blizz didn't want to happen?<br />

Such bullshit, just like the character customization response. No barbershops wouldn't make the game play better per say, but it's something people have come to expect in an mmo.. you could say &quot;having tier gear look unique isn't going to benefit gameplay so we've decided you wear blank textures&quot;. It doesn't make any sense, it's about a certain quality standard. Sure it takes time, money and dev.. but doing things like say implementing dye has longevity. It's retarded it's not something in game already.. shouldn't my toon look kinda different from every other warlock out there if I so choose? Shouldn't I have some kinda of insurance if say the devs decide to make pink warlock gear next patch? (you know they will)<br />
<br />
Say it take the same time... How long before all your caster dps'ers got a legendary weapon ? Compared to the amount of casters in a 25man.<br />
<br />
You'll gain a legendary for 1% of your raid, just as fast (if not faster) than the 25man will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets not forget that the 10 man WILL be balanced like its has the RNG drop rate of 25 mans. That includes drop rate of items for legendery. <br />
10 man raid is more than twice as hard to gear up than 25 man based on a simple RNG caclulations. Thats why 10 man raids are simply not viable atm and ppl that are trying to play &quot;casually&quot; in 10 mans should reaslie they are doing it the hardest way possible. <br />
<br />
Has anyone compared how many items are dissed in 10 man vs 25 mans per person ? Do it please.</div></div><hr />

Stats wouldn't matter. - Pokemonmasta (EU|English), Tajit (NA/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: Cool idea. We'll talk about it.<br />
<br />
That'd be pretty badass. I've already put together several Orgrimmar Grunt outfits for my orc characters, but with my latest orc warrior I wanted to do a Kor'kron Elite outfit ... problem is that some of the set is reported to drop off of mobs no longer in the game (the world dragons), and there's no similar boot pattern. It's also fairly pricey trying to snag said greens off the AH. If upon hitting Exalted (or even Revered or Honored) with Orgrimmar I could go to the Orgrimmar vendor and buy the bits for a uniform that'd be sweeeeeeeet.<br />
<br />
Also, I think Blizzard is reluctant to add something as simple and tacky as dyes to the game because once you add that, what little difference there is between colorization goes out the window. Everyone will want to be black or red or blue - and if it's attached to a profession, the economy starts becoming based around dyes and that profession's ability to craft them. The mats themselves become astronomical or over-farmed, and the resulting dye becomes absurdly priced and stays that way, with only minor undercutting and price-gouging. Look at Guild Wars or LotRO. LotRO's black dye - made by a crafting profession called a Scholar - was upwards of 600g for one. (The real kick in the gonads was that free-to-play members capped out at FIVE gold, just to give you an idea of the economy there. Trial WoW accounts cap out at 10g.) And if it's a simple gold-sink shop like the barber, it removes the economy and rising price concerns, but it doesn't lessen the fact that every rogue will come out of there in black and red armor, every warlock in red and black (with green accents for fel fire or Affliction), and so on and so forth. Look at how many human males have the Varian Wrynn/belf ponytail.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Minky</div><div class="date">2011-04-05, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A: As we said in an earlier Q&amp;A, we definitely hear loud and clear from players that they want more customization for their character. This is something we want to provide, but we want to do it in the right way. Consider the Barber Shop feature. It lets you change your character's hair, but there’s not a lot of gameplay to it. We're not sure that feature really added a lot to the game in retrospect. Is WoW more fun for you now that you have a Barber Shop? Are you more likely to keep playing because of it? Maybe, but it wasn’t a cheap feature to add in terms of development time. Dumping a bunch of dyes on the game might have a similar effect, where some players might have fun playing around with the system for a bit, but a lot of players might change their colors once or twice and then forget about the feature after that. Now, not every aspect of the game needs a ton of depth and a lot of interesting decisions, but we tend to attract more players to a feature the more robust the feature is.<br />
<br />
We also think it's fair to argue that the game just needs more armor and weapon art. As we said above, we deliver a lot of art these days, but we also produce an enormous number of new items every expansion or patch and it’s understandably disappointing whenever items use the same art. It would be really cool if not every mage or priest converged on the same look after a given expansion or patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
We're not sure that feature really added a lot to the game in retrospect.<br />
Are they serious?<br />
Fun customizable things don't add much to the game?<br />

' 'The Barber Shop was a bad investment because it doesn't add meaningful gameplay' '? Are they SERIOUS??? I honestly can't do anything but laugh at this rationale. More player-customization in a game with such limited options at the outset is always a good thing.<br />
<br />
And the sentence &quot;Are you more likely to keep playing because of it?&quot; I think speaks loads of their mindset now -- it's like if a feature isn't deemed to directly give players something to do (i.e., adding another ride to the theme park), it's almost-indefinitely backburnered. Almost as if they're trying to actively cater the game to the Call of Duty crowd...<br />
<br />
As any great dev house will tell you (e.g., Valve (ask them about how well TF2's Mannconomy is doing, lol)), focus on making the greatest game possible, and the players (money) will come in droves. Blizzard used to operate like this, they focused on making a great game. Something obviously changed somewhere along the line though, because they obviously aren't thinking like this any more; it's all about ' 'how can we keep people playing longer' ' to them now, and perceived quality is starting to suffer because of it... especially as other titles come out and inevitable comparisons are made. Their obstinateness to staying ahead of, or even with, the trend/curve is going to be their death knell eventually. :(<br />
<br />
And they say Activision's acquisition had - and will have - no effect on the way they operate... :rolleyes:<br />

BLizzard is on very tight budget since most of the money the earn through WOW is going into project Titan. Its called - Milking the Cow. Or maybe we should just call it like it is -Milking WOW! with store mounts and re-used armors and dungeons.<br />

I see a lot of promises they wont keep again. I don't blame them though, it's a matter of cost vs benefit. A lot of cool new features for Wow simply won't bring in any new subcriptions. I have a feeling Wow is on the decline though, but will features like being able to change your characters looks, or cross server BOA items stop that? I don't think so.<br />
<br />
They might not bring in new subs right away - but it might help them keep some subs and more positive talk about the game. Alot of ppl have lost all intrest in the game with the total lack of innovation that expansion Cata brought into the game.<br />
<br />
Cost should not be a question for a game that has 12 million subs. Players have been asking for more custimisation and then Blizzard should respect those players and add more to it. They are ignoring it and ppl are going to other games like Rift and later both SWOTOR and GW2. <br />
<br />
WOW is fast becoming HELLO KITTY of MMOs. Its so far behind in many basic features that other games are able to bring to the table atm.</div></div><hr />

There is literally NO defense for them on this. Before it was &quot;Design vs Time&quot;, now they have the nerve to bring up &quot;Design vs Time&quot;?! Really?! The most profitable MMO ever, we see their investor/fiscal reports, and they have the nerve to say this? Here's a summary of what they're saying:<br />
<br />
- &quot;We like your money, a lot, and we're going to take it and put it into D3, SC2, and Titan, and we're going to slash the budget on WoW thus recycling tons of assets and slower than even for us development times&quot;.<br />
- &quot;We like your money, thus we're going to make many more real-money pet/mount options&quot;.<br />
- &quot;We like your money, we're not going to give players what they want, customization. If people can dye their own armor, then we can't recolor/recycle it more and more times&quot;.<br />
- &quot;We like your money, we're not going to spend more time on unique armor models, instead, we're going to recycle everything including what we called at one time class-defining armor sets. Now all plate wearers can look alike. All Mail can. All Leather can. All Cloth look like their special class identifying Tier sets.<br />
- &quot;We really like your money, we're not going to put it back into the game that makes us this money, at least as much as we should. Instead, we're going to take your monies and put them into the other projects, like D3, SC2, and Titan. Titan will be the first MMO ever to launch in the black on investment thanks to your money from WoW&quot;.<br />
- &quot;We really really like your money, and we pulled off key talent and developers and left the job to OTJ trained devs to do all the art, encounters, and especially balancing efforts&quot;.<br />
- &quot;We tremendously love your money, and we know we got a large number of you all hooked, and that no matter what, YOU WON'T DARE OPPOSE US. We feed off your weak, feeble minds, tears, and especially your wallet. You're not getting unique art anymore, no customization options, and we're giving you less content than ever before. And you're going to take it, and like it&quot;.<br />
<br />
That's the summary here for all of the dev QAs that we got. Their responses on some of the &quot;harder&quot; questions (which are jokes) are smoke screens, and canned beat-around-the-bush replies.<br />
<br />
When WoW's profits begin to decline, they'll act stupid and bewildered to why people left, that they're not happy, but even they know why that's happening. It's a shame, blizzard used to be a great company, one that cared about their games, and more importantly fans. Now they're just heartless, out for cash. Not surprising when Mike M has to report to Kotick, and that is a FACT. It's a shame to see my favorite game crumble like the USSR. But hey, at least there's more quality options out there for my money and support than ever, so I can at least move on to developers that are like how blizzard used to be at one time. /rant</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;A: Yes. We plan on implementing a system where winning an item via Need (when using the Dungeon Finder Need Before Greed loot system) will make a BoE item soulbound. We hope to have this working for the 4.2 patch.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is probably the single most interesting bit of the whole thing. I love this idea.<br />
<br />
I believe I have been suggesting something like this on WoW's suggestion forums for a year or two as of now, and I doubt I was the first. Although I would go beyond; I would take away the sell price of any gear won through need rolls, and make it immune to being disenchanted to boot. That way, need would only be used to get gear to use (or to grief, but the griefer would be losing the chance to earn gold by doing so), since the only way of getting rid of gear won through a &quot;need&quot; roll would be to destroy it.<br />
<br />
(BTW, LotRO implemented the idea of raid gear being useless for making gold this last patch; it can't be sold, only manually deleted. It's an interesting twist on the idea, and it has a nice collateral effect of making characters on compromised accounts much more likely to escape with their gear intact.)<br />

<br />
repeating my comment on wowhead: <br />
<br />
They're completely off on the dye comment. I hardly doubt the majority of players would &quot;forget it&quot; like the barbershop. You only get hair once, and you only chance when you feel like it, but with dyes, whenever you get a new piece of armor, you'll feel compeled to try new colors to match your current gear. It's a renewing system, not a &quot;one-time only deal&quot; like the barber shop, where you get your results once and that's it.<br />
<br />
I can say one thing for sure: in every game where I can choose the color of my gear, I go for one among a small selection of color combinations. WoW tier gear, unfortunately, hasn't used color schemes I found pleasing since before BC, thus I would probably be a heavy user of dyes.<br />
<br />
Of course, dyes would mean Blizzard would need to actually create different gear art for heroic-grade gear, instead of using lazy recolors.</div></div><hr />

It would just delude the loot ables on bosses with more items that people don't need anymore, and then just be forgotten<br />
<br />
In cases like this, they could use a similar loot system they had for Sunwell with the Sunmotes. Instead of filling up loot tables with several items with like stats but different art, you could have one drop and trade it in with 'X' trade item and bam, different piece (though during Sunwell this was spec trading items, ie: dps pants for tank pants, etc). Something like this could help in various ways such as humans not wanting an axe, but a sword and vice versa with an Orc (or those who just like swords over axes, like myself).</div></div><hr />

A lot of people were extremely unhappy with both the Goblin and Worgen casting animations even though they are the most 'advanced' of all the casting animations. I can't imagine the backlash if they did a major revamp of casting animations for current races in game. Hence it's really just not worth it in the end. <br />
<br />
I'm not a fan of Dyes at all, I think the best system is actually a Reforging system specifically for gear. You have a tier piece you don't like the look of, you can 'reforge' the stats onto whatever armor you do like. Make it come with a penalty (similar to reforging), and this enables Blizzard to both get people to stick to the actual designed armor but also give players the freedom to style up their gear however they want.</div></div><hr />

This is a brilliant example of a total exaggeration.<br />
Any class and spec gan get more than half of slots filled with 359 epics without making a single step into a raid instance.<br />

True ninjas will still need a 359 BoE epic drop even if they have a better item in that slot already just because they better have their 20g vendor gold than risking the chance someone else might greed win it and get 5k for it :) The main point of ninja-needing of true ninjas isn't just gold, it's the griefing effect mainly.<br />

You don't have a clue about their other running and WoW development costs.<br />
You are all acting like they have ALL of their income just sitting around waiting to be thrown around at any random emo whim some 0.5% of the subscriber base imagines as necessary.<br />
Even the application and validation process of &quot;1000&quot; professional animators costs more than you imagine. Even if you get a professional animator, that does not mean they can instantly adapt to the whole WoW art and animation style. And also in most cases hiring more just does not imply getting stuff done faster. Learn some BASICS of how stuff happens in complex projects where more than 1 person is involved.<br />
<br />
Also for the &quot;hello world&quot; guys, well..., WoW is not a Hello World type of application. We are talking about multiple million code lines here and a complex, distrubuted data base system. Your one trivial &quot;hello world&quot; type of change can easily break hundreds of other things. No matter how well you initially plan the expandability of your system, you just can't always perfectly predict impact of all possible changes ten years forward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ive got this idea, you could add a &quot;Use&quot; effect to wands, relics used to have a Equip effect, which was later removed and replaced with stats. I'd love to see wands have a some sort of attack or effect when used. Also i liked the relic equip effects, it provided some more situational buffs, which is overall more fun and exciting than the passive stats like it is now.</div></div><hr />

Does what it says on the tin? If you're running a raid and the Master Looter is ninjaing gear without reason, then leave. Really. If it's persistent, report it.

They're completely off on the dye comment. I hardly doubt the majority of players would &quot;forget it&quot; like the barbershop. You only get hair once, and you only chance when you feel like it, but with dyes, whenever you get a new piece of armor, you'll feel compeled to try new colors to match your current gear. It's a renewing system, not a &quot;one-time only deal&quot; like the barber shop, where you get your results once and that's it.<br />
<br />
If the deside to implement some kind of dye system, they should add it to a profession, like inscription.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those plate belts are incredibly horrible, plate boots aswell, horrible, the upgrade on the legs were howesome tho...but these are personal tastes, and im sure alot of ppl would agree... so it should be ourselves to decide... it shouldn t be hard to add a feature like that...<br />

A: This is something we would dearly love to do. We agree that melee specs get to see their weapons a lot more often in combat while it's easy for casters to forget about them.

<br />
If this is actually done it better be done so as an option that you can toggle on and off. I will actually be very dissapointed if I am forced to cast spells with a twig or branch in my characters hand. They got the casting animations right the first time and not including your weapons.</div></div><hr />

Not only dye system - they should have gem cutters cutting out diffrent color for gems that can be put into gear - Tailors making changable looks of cape patterns - Leatherworkers making diffrent looking saddles on mounts... The possiblites are endless. Its true it does not improve gameplay... but it will not hurt it either in terms of PVE. And alot of ppl would absolutly love these features. <br />
<br />
Blizzard has desided to stick to a 5 year old design that is now very much outdated and can so easily be expanded on. It will cost - but thats exactly what most of the subscribers feel that BLizzard ows us. To continue to develop the game and give more features that strengthen the overall game into the future. Blizzard has desided to ignore those views 100% for the past 5 years. And instead added archeology in cata.... PPL are still playing WOW tho since other games are not offering the same type of gameplay with the extra features. This is changing now and new games are coming out with huge custimation options + top quality content and gameplay. I hope that BLizzard will then realise how navie and arrogant they are in not listening to their playerbase when it comes to such HUGE features as character and gear looks. <br />
<br />
Addons have given players in WOW endless chances to custimise the game to their liking. And BLizzard dares to talk about potential dye or custimazation system like its a barbershop junk that very few wanted into the game in the first place ? <br />
<br />
Im playing RIft - I love it - Im lvling a profession that makes dyes and its absolutly fantastic. YOu can also buy dyes from lvl 1 from vendor and thats something that makes you feel less of a clown while lvling cause at least you can make all the gear the same color. <br />
<br />
Its absoltuly abysmal to have to listen to Blizzard devs in 2011 talk like its 2005. The game is not evovling at all atm. Compare that to EVE online for example that is adding so many new great systems into the game - like planetary features and walking on spacestations. Someththing that ppl have been asking for and CCP has listened. <br />
<br />
BLIzzard is not listening atm. They are ignoring their playerbase. They have found a way to make money the easy way and are ready to milk it like Microsoft with new sofware versions releasing every year. <br />
<br />
Yes - BLizzard is now the MICROSOFT of the gaming industry. They consider themselfs to be so big that they can do whatever (or in this case nothing) - skipping content developments and new features - and instead selling store mounts and advertising sale on items in store.<br />
<br />
Im totally discusted in what BLizzard is turning into.</div></div><hr />

Maybe we only do it once, but it is so much more fun to have an unique character model rather than only have a different hair cut which 800 ohter ppl on ure server have.<br />
So much ppl asked this before, put some freaking more ppl on it. if u can transfer a char from one realm to another, so can u transfer gear!<br />
<br />
Their profits at this current state of the game (since it's been in the black for years now in the books) come from new comers buying up all the expansions, not so much the &quot;newest content&quot; xpacs at launch, but more than anything from subscriptions. Yes WE pay their bills for their dev house, WE pay their salary, WE pay for the upkeep of the game, WE pay for the new content. Problem here is blizzard isn't giving their players a return investment for obvious reason.<br />
<br />
You really think it's &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;too expensive&quot; for them to create more art, animation, and customization options? No. After all, they made their premium out of game AH service with no qualms.<br />
<br />
What they mean when they say &quot;Expensive&quot; is not development time, it means the profits/attraction of said function/feature/artwork wouldn't matter as the sheeple will continue to play the game no matter what they do. So why not do as little as possible, get around to it when they do (slower than ever, they STILL didn't get out 4.1 which doesn't include a raid that was announced months before Cata launched), and then allocate the vast majority of your profits to pay for other projects along with key talent so those new games that will come out in 5 years from now will be in the black on day one. They don't need &quot;investment&quot; into their new projects as WoW pays for everything itself. They don't need to hire talented devs for WoW because it doesn't take much to get by.<br />
<br />
Yes, heirlooms were supposed to be cross-account since the FIRST DAY they were announced years ago, but look where that ended up, rotting right next to the dance studio.<br />
<br />
Blizzard likes to use said blanket/safety net phrases like &quot;we want it done to our expected quality&quot; or &quot;we're trying to figure out how to do this the best way&quot;, but it's a smokescreen that covers up the direct questions of &quot;you make this money, why don't you put it back into the game making you said money, and improve character models/unique weapon and item art/animations/character customizations/account-wide BoA/Dance Studio/etc.<br />
<br />
But this isn't just all blizzard's and Bobby Kotick's fault as it wouldn't have come to this if all the sheeple who play this would have stood up and at least SAID something about it instead of allowing them to dilute the game and their efforts in said game to the levels they've gotten to. Now we get the scraps and left overs, blizzard is putting as little effort, time, and money into the game as possible to fatten their already bursting wallet. Not we, you all still paying, my accounts done now as I'm not waiting ICC time lengths for new raid content and that they just don't care about their community and basically mock it in their offices &quot;thank you sir, may I have another&quot;? I'd like to say it was quite a ride. Epic highs, but even more epic lows. It's like watching the rise and fall of an empire in our day and age.</div></div><hr />

I LOL'D SO HARD. ITS EXPENSIVE AHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAA HOW MUCH MONEY DO THEY GET PER MONTH.......<br />
<br />
He's talking about expensive time wise. The animators get paid the same amount no matter what project they're working on. they get salary. Why would you assume that he was talking about expensive in terms of money? They're still doing their job. doesn't mean they're going to get paid more because it's a more time consuming project.<br />

Ive got this idea, you could add a &quot;Use&quot; effect to wands, relics used to have a Equip effect, which was later removed and replaced with stats. I'd love to see wands have a some sort of attack or effect when used. Also i liked the relic equip effects, it provided some more situational buffs, which is overall more fun and exciting than the passive stats like it is now.<br />
<br />
i love that idea. it would give casters another trinket to use basically. Like a use effect that increases spell haste or something for a short time.</div></div><hr />

Hey guys! I'm not sure that dyes is the way to go about customizing your toon *hastily types code on PC*<br />

Yea we might have to consider other options *discusses charging 5 bucks per color change via Blizzard online store with unidentified employee*<br />

Lololol, he meant what he said, and he said what he meant. Expensive ≠ Time-consuming.

Instead they now talk of time to make it. <br />
<br />
Here is the thing. TBC brought ALOT of new stuff because Blizzard added a NEW EXTRA dev team to the game that came up with some of the greatest and most awsome part of the game yet. Karazhan had some of the greatest encounters ever created - and even random ones. Now.... on budget and time !! if it doesn't make us max amount of money back we are not doing it... <br />
<br />
Blizzard needs a new second team. Team that knows what has been happening in the game - knows what the long term RPG !! players have been going through. The current team is thinkng time/money versus profit. And thats shines through everything that is beeing done. <br />
<br />
The sad part about it is that instead of spending the money into future WOW design - they are spending the money on another MMOPRG project. And as a RPG player that has a character in WOW - that is a scandal and show Blizzard does not care ONE bit and have ZERO understanding about what mmoRPG means.<br />

<br />
And you dont think BLizzard should have the money to keep building a car out of motorcycle ? Thats what ppl are pointing out. They are pointing out that instead of BLizzard building on an existing game that has huge amount of subs... they are taking the money and putting it into another project - the &quot;CAR&quot; project.<br />
<br />
I would find that perfectly fine if not for the fact that we are talking RPG game. We are talking of ppl's character in CURRENT game that they are CURRENTLY paying for. Blizzard is KILLING those characters bit by bit with the current lack of design innovation in WOW. And thats something that a true RPG player will never forgive them.<br />
<br />
BLizzard has not got it yet how damaging this truely is to the company. They are litterally mocking every single WOW player for the past 6 years. And they dont give a dam.</div></div><hr />
