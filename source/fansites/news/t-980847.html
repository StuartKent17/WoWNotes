Tier 13 Set Pieces Acquisition<br />
We recognize that making the tier 13 set pieces available only as raid drops leaves players much more subject to RNG drop rates/loot rolls, but we have a couple of plans to try and alleviate the sense of burden that stems from the randomness of token drops.<br />
<br />
The way tier 13 pieces will be obtained in the 4.3 raid won't be unlike raids past, meaning players will still need to roll on multi-class set tokens. That said, we'll be tweaking the tier 13 10-player drop rates a little bit (for the better) relative to the 25-player version, given that these tier pieces can't be purchased from vendors for Valor Points.<br />
<br />
In addition, due to tier pieces not being offered for Valor Points, another thing you'll see in patch 4.3 is a much wider array of desirable non-set loot (covering more slots than prior patches) available from the vendors, for those players who are unlucky with specific token drops, or who aren't interested in raiding—although, once you get more details about the Raid Finder, we hope you'll find interest in having a go.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind we do intend to allow tier 13 set pieces to drop for those using the upcoming Raid Finder. Similar to the difference between normal and Heroic versions of tier sets, the Raid Finder set will have a lower item level than the normal and Heroic counterparts.<br />
<br />
Set pieces from all three difficulty levels can still be mixed and matched for the two and four-piece bonuses.</div></div><hr />

This is of course from the point of view that you are in a raiding guild and are raiding actively. For the not so inclined it definitely sounds like a plus.<br />

<br />
Do you actually think that a LFR raid will take lets say 1hour to complete so you can do 24 of them each day?<br />
With the incoming amount of failure you will barely able to complete 1 per 2-3 days and this from an optimist point of view</div></div><hr />

I'm not looking to do the raid finder 24 times a day, or even more than once a week. I want to know if LFR will block me from entering the instance with my guild as well. <br />

Reading comprehension issue?<br />
<br />
They said the LFR will not lock you out of normal and heroic raids, but not if it will lock you out of LFR itself. I doubt you will be able to farm LFR raids, so I expect that you can only kill each boss once through LFR and once in normal/heroic per week. If not, good raiders will start farming it like crazy and get Tier13 in one week :)</div></div><hr />

I appreciate Vanquisher needs to be slightly higher but not 8/10 chance. Here's hoping the fix with Tier13 will produce more varied token drops :).</div></div><hr />

Agreed. They keep trying to make it easier and easier for everyone to raid.. when that is not the problem. The problem is that there is no challenging content for solo players. They should have kept raids challenging for raiders, but actually made solo dungeons that were fun and interesting, along with quests that were challenging. Instead, they dumb down raids and at the same time make quests absolutely silly easy. The firelands dailies were the biggest waste of time ever, killing mobs in 2 seconds.. it was just a chore to get people to log in every day for 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
I would much prefer if they allowed solo players to have challenging content, without pushing us to do raids. Still don´t understand how games like DDO can have very challenging solo dungeons and have raids at the same time.</div></div><hr />

I think they actually will allow you to do LFR very frequently. Since it's going to be easier and have worse loot and they want people to see the content, it seems rational that they wouldn't care about how much you farm it. I think they're going to allow these pugs to bust their heads against the wall as much as the want until they can figure out boss strats. Normal raiders will be busy in real raids trying to get the higher ilvl most of the time, only doing LFR on offdays, and people will come and go during LFR so lockouts don't really make much sense for LFR to me.</div></div><hr />

I would much prefer if they allowed solo players to have challenging content, without pushing us to do raids. Still don´t understand how games like DDO can have very challenging solo dungeons and have raids at the same time.<br />
<br />
It's difficult to make challenging solo content when the core game mechanics revolve around clicking macros and moving your character. The game only gets complex / 'difficult' when groups of individual players all have to do their jobs correctly at the same time.</div></div><hr />

The idea is good as it allows players that normally don't raid a chance to raid. It will hopefully teach the tactics on bosses and perhaps even bring up casual guilds in the loop. I'm not talking about your definition of &quot;casual&quot; i mean, really casual as in barely making any progress in a normal raid. Should at least make the game a little more exciting for a few people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really doubt they will allow chain LFRs. They're not that retarded to burn their &quot;pinnacle&quot; content that fast.<br />
<br />
LFR is not there to show off, it's supposed to fix their mistakes with the gap between nerfed heroics and normal raiding (getting nerfed non-stop to try to fix it). Also, common, taking all that effort of making raid easier to do and all, more interesting drops, tokens, etc. just to let ppl just spam it non-stop 7 days per week? If they wanted it that stupid fast, they would just remove the valor cap instead.<br />
<br />
It's just &quot;Looking for Raid&quot;, not yet &quot;random raid&quot;. Remember that you can only spam heroics if you're going with the random option, you can't just select one heroic and keep going on it the entire day, the 24h lockout remains. There is only ONE raid, nothing random about it. We could argue about it if LFR was released in 4.0, since you had 3 raids to choose from, then it could be possible for them to come with random T11 raid... but with only one??? The only random thing you would be able to get now is the skill of the group you're going to get throwed into... lol<br />
<br />
But well... it's BlizzardACTIVISION... so... maybe not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So will the first action for the majority of non-Firelands-farming players be: <br />
1) Buy any 278 you're missing with 4000 JP<br />
2) Clear the new heroics (Do they have normal/heroic versions like the ICC dungeons?), load up on loot.<br />
3) When you've hit 980 VP, buy something (bracers?) from the Normal-T13 range and fill in any 278 gaps with all your JP.<br />
4) Go easy-mode raiding! for the LFR-T13 range<br />
5) Back to the heroics!<br />
5) When you've filled up on Heroic-lvl gear, go proper raiding, if you can.<br />
<br />
One thing I've got the impression of is that a lot of people have been hitting the 980 VP cap week after week, and so there really is going to need to be a decent JP dump in 4.3.<br />
<br />
This will definitely help my guild, who have a few really good core players but are just struggling to get a team together. If we go LFR, we can probably push/pull/yell a bunch of galoots together through a few bosses, and if we can pug a 10-man with the good ones, and then next week bring those back in with us for the LFR....</div></div><hr />

If so, I will still be joining premade raids on my server versus any random idiots in the queue. I can at least gear check the folks in a premade. This changes nothing for my alts if that is the case. They better be adjusting the vote kick function for LFR, because it's terrible how it is now in LFD. Thinking about some of the people I've had to kick out of dungeon groups, those people queuing for a raid makes me cringe: tanks with no avoidance, DPS that queued as heals, healers that have no mana management....the list of nightmares could go on and on and on....<br />
<br />
Even if a raid is &quot;easy mode&quot;, it's still a raid that requires an understanding of the fight mechanics and a general awareness that, based on my LFD experience, a lot of people do not have. Even pugging the nerfed T11 raids on my alts, numerous groups still cannot kill Nefarian in BWD. Why? Because you cannot power through that encounter. It requires specific organization that a lot of PuGs sadly cannot effectively overcome. <br />
<br />
Tell me again why I would want to put myself through that if I can just form a premade?</div></div><hr />

Instead, they dumb down raids and at the same time make quests absolutely silly easy.

Unfortunately there are those that need to be over geared to raid. Just the facts. They try their best, but the majority have been playing for maybe a year or two and have absolutely no idea what you are all talking about when you say it was so hard in BC, Vanilla was the best. Many of them have never set foot in Naxx or Ulduar, let alone ICC.<br />
<br />
They have full 359 Epic gear and have issues breaking 9k DPS, or have trouble with complex healing combinations to get the most output. They see themsleves taking lots of damage and gem/reforge Stamina for more health. They just don't know. Hardly any guilds have Class leaders anymore, its all L2P noobcakes, run heroic dungeons and trolls until you puke and buy gear, or guilds just give gear to them in the hopes that maybe having better gear will help them improve.<br />
<br />
If....and I know it is too far gone to go back...they did away with random dungeon and coming soon raid finder, what would we be doing. We would be looking for guilds with a lot of active players, maybe a pug here and there, but all of these hundreds of little 12 and 14 roster guilds, or even ones with close to 100 but its only 15 people with piles of Alt's would slowly disappear and we would see a return to the days when guild chat was more active than Trade, people would act more professionally because having a name and reputation meant you got to raid, or you were asked to help on dungeon runs. The game has become too impersonal and people are no longer accountable for how they act.</div></div><hr />

They did mention they were going to change the way tier pieces drop for the better, so at least the drop rates are meant to be better. But ye, the number of dk tokens that have dropped this tier has been rediculous, a generalised token could help, especially with the lack of vp. But without rng, youd never get that moment when you dont take a class to bh10, just tohave that class' 2-piece drop. Woot</div></div><hr />

I count myself really fortunate to have gotten one shoulder token for my main last tier, and I never got the helm. After all this time in firelands, I haven't gotten the shoulders or helm, and I'm starting to worry that I won't be able to until the only thing they'll be good for is transmogrification.<br />
<br />
I don't know why this is even being done. Maybe it's because they no longer want people who don't raid to get the latest tier. If that's the case, maybe they need to go back to having valor points earned through dungeons disconnected from valor points earned through raids, so that only raiders can get VP enough to buy tier in a timely fashion. They'll also have a great reason to do more dungeons again--to augment their VP for the week, even after a full clear (though I hope these three new dungeons aren't tucked away in their own tier like the Zandalari dungeons, for variety's sake). So when raiders get a lot more valor, those who don't raid won't be able to afford the tier gear until long after raiders get it, which still strongly encourages them to use the Raid Finder. You can still have the tier tokens drop from bosses as well, for further encouragement to raid so that if you're lucky, you can spend that valor on the non-tier items instead, and also sooner. If you're not lucky, you have to wait. That's the way I think is better. The way Blizzard is handling this looks like &quot;If you're not lucky, you just don't ever get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's just that, should I be as unlucky as I historically have been when it comes to these tokens, I don't want to raid every single week only to go into Mists of Pandaria with only two or three pieces of tier 13.</div></div><hr />

That way if you get a poorly itemized tier piece, you can still get your 4 piece bonus without having to worry about the lack of a competitive slot option. Now for plate wearers and their stat itemization, will this mean that there are different styles of pieces per slot to compensate for the vastly different ways plate DPS wearers gear up? So having Crit + Hit, Hit + Mastery, Haste + Mastery types of options would be nice to cover all slots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the same for 25man raiders. On MD, the first 8 out 9 Tokens were DK/Mage/Druid.... so they already equip for 2nd equip, while the other tokens are still very much needed.<br />
<br />
There has to some kind of fix to this. This sucks and it sucks probably even more in 10man.<br />
<br />
But as i now raid 10man, i don't think it would be fair to make it 2 tokens in 10m and 3 in 25man. That would be really ridicilous. There should be a fair ratio and 25man raiding already died out because of 10man being much easier. We also changed from (25man 1/7 heroic in 6 weeks progression) to (10man 5/7 heroic in two(!!) weeks).<br />

well, looks like its time to transfer or quit playing... I am on a dead server, only way I could get my 2 piece anything is from Valor points, maybe with the raid finder I might be able to raid more then once or twice a month now... Or just start playing something else.<br />
<br />
Well when you don't raid, you don't need t13. The new 5mans will be doable without it and PVP has it's own gear, so why bother getting t13 when you have no real use for it?<br />
<br />
The new raid tool should allow you to raid whenever you want. Though i bet i don't have the nerves to raid with you when you actually have pretty no raiding experience. I don't know how much easier it will be, but from what i see in random raids, they are very very bad in everything. Their gear is okay and enough, but movement, concentration and so on are mostly really terrible.</div></div><hr />

This is of course from the point of view that you are in a raiding guild and are raiding actively. For the not so inclined it definitely sounds like a plus.<br />
<br />
I however am a raider &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
Not having to plow through the same 2 instances 6/7 times for no reason other than points would likely get me interested in doing a little more raiding again. I could NOT be bothered running em again and again just for point so felt I wasn't trying hard enough for gear, wasn't contributing so quit to do more pvp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bound4Earth</div><div class="date">2011-09-24, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love my guild, I enjoy playing with most of the people in it. Unfortunately there are those that need to be over geared to raid. Just the facts. They try their best, but the majority have been playing for maybe a year or two and have absolutely no idea what you are all talking about when you say it was so hard in BC, Vanilla was the best. Many of them have never set foot in Naxx or Ulduar, let alone ICC.<br />
<br />
They have full 359 Epic gear and have issues breaking 9k DPS, or have trouble with complex healing combinations to get the most output. They see themsleves taking lots of damage and gem/reforge Stamina for more health. They just don't know. Hardly any guilds have Class leaders anymore, its all L2P noobcakes, run heroic dungeons and trolls until you puke and buy gear, or guilds just give gear to them in the hopes that maybe having better gear will help them improve.<br />
<br />
If....and I know it is too far gone to go back...they did away with random dungeon and coming soon raid finder, what would we be doing. We would be looking for guilds with a lot of active players, maybe a pug here and there, but all of these hundreds of little 12 and 14 roster guilds, or even ones with close to 100 but its only 15 people with piles of Alt's would slowly disappear and we would see a return to the days when guild chat was more active than Trade, people would act more professionally because having a name and reputation meant you got to raid, or you were asked to help on dungeon runs. The game has become too impersonal and people are no longer accountable for how they act.<br />
<br />
The fact that you mention the redone Naxx or Uldaur shows how you, yourself have no experience with vanilla or any real content. Where it took 4-6 moths plus alone to prep for raiding, unless you had mad money. Back when guilds didn't have banks and rolled with bank alts and didn't bank roll other toons. Guild chat in the real guilds is more active then trade and always has been. Even if raiding isn't as big a deal as it used to be doesn't mean you have to bash guilds like yours that have no real potential. You have to question your skill for being in said guild.</div></div><hr />

So far my guild has had 10 kills on Majordomo Staghelm - 8 of the token drops have been Vanquisher with 1 Protector and 1 Conqueror....bloody rediculous and I really hope it's a bit more balanced with the next tier.<br />
<br />
I appreciate Vanquisher needs to be slightly higher but not 8/10 chance. Here's hoping the fix with Tier13 will produce more varied token drops :).<br />
