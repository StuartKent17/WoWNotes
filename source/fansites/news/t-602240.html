<br />
Considering the location of Neth's post, it's far more likely that the &quot;sooner than most&quot; patch she's referencing is 2.3 (although she is replying to a question about 2.2, so /shrug). It's highly unlikely they'd put out a patch on Friday when most of the devs would be out for the weekend.<br />
<br />
Look for 2.2 to be released on Tuesday, and then 2.3 to go up on the PTR very shortly thereafter. It likely won't be on there long either, as the Blue posts regarding it have basically said it's finished and undergone a lot of internal testing.</div></div><hr />

is the 2.3 patch the one with sunwell plateau (or whatever is the name of the T7 instance)?<br />
<br />
If it is, maybe - and even so I doubt [regarding a spring release date]<br />
<br />
If there is a 2.4 - put it on December 2007 release - I doubt they would give it less than 6 month of live (Naxx had that time I think). So I'll be expecting a September to December 2008 release of WOLK.<br />

/off topic <br />
Was TBC a success? <br />
<br />
Comercially... maybe/likely. Yes, I know that there were a million - or two - extra subscribers BUT even so it can only be considered successful if it increased the sales beyond what the projected wow numbers would be without it. I also would much like to know the distribution of the subscribers - lets not forget that Asia has different - internet cafes based - subscription that entail a different revenues per sub. As I also have no idea of the different prices (and the cuts that the middleman take), cna't be much definite about it, but I wouldn't be surprised that the average net revenue in Asia would be less than half than the &quot;west&quot; ones. Which means that for each sub they lose in here (US/Europe) they need two to make up for hte lost revenue. But I digress and TBC was most likely a commercial success.<br />
<br />
But as games go it was a mess. Yes it has interesting and great features (&lt;3 epic flying mounts), more content, more interesting boss fights and the Arena (couldn't care less, but many seem to like them ;). But it also had a completely screwed up itemization and class balance (particularly until the BT patch), role reversals (ask priests...) and disparate profession benefits (e.g. tailor vs engineering...). Oh and a xxxxxed up raiding ladder... (10=&gt;25; not fun instances; SCC+TK attunements, no &quot;ZG&quot; or &quot;MC&quot;...)<br />
<br />
Many good players I knew left, and I ended up doing the same (at least for now). While after 18 months any game would take the toll, fact is when I ask any friend that it is still in the game (raiders), they mostly say they preferred the game pre TBC... despite all the improvements ???<br />
<br />
/end off topic<br />
<br />
Nathaera was definitely talking about 2.2, not 2.3. And it will be applied on the regular patching day next week (at least we all expect so). <br />
<br />
And even if ti is launched in December 31st 2008, Blizz can say &quot;1 XP per year!&quot; with a straight face :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you're right in that it was a commercial success, but a failure overall as an expansion, and perhaps I didn't allude to that clear enough in my prior post. :)<br />
<br />
Itemization is definitely screwed up and you don't have to tell me about the disparate profession benefits. I'm an Elemental Leatherworker. My specialist recipes suck not only in comparison to tailors, but also in compared to the druid-friendly Tribal LW and hunter/shaman-friendly Dragonscale LW. Their specialized items had sockets. Mine was just a heaping pile of suck dressed up w/ lots of AP.<br />
<br />
Blizzard should learn from the KZ debacle not to put Tier armor tokens in 10-man raids. 10-mans should be tailored more for casual raiders who don't have the benefit of large rosters and offer both a comparable challenge and comparable rewards. Like I said, hopefully, the devs learn from their mistakes and take an adequate amount of time fine tuning the next Xpac. We don't need another disaster rushed onto the shelves.</div></div><hr />

Like I said, hopefully, the devs learn from their mistakes and take an adequate amount of time fine tuning the next Xpac. We don't need another disaster rushed onto the shelves.I agree that 10-mans should not be part of standard progression. IMO, There should be 4 &quot;endgames&quot;:<br />
PvP: Arena, that new PvP zone, and BGs.<br />
PvE: 5-mans and heroics<br />
Light Raiding: 10-man raids<br />
Heavy Raiding: 25-man raids<br />
Note: By light and heavy, I'm merely referring to how many people are involved.<br />
Anyway, it's my firm opinion that having 10-man and 25-man raids on the same progression track is a bad move. When you arrive in Karazhan, you get used to that 10-man size, as you slowly work your way through Karazhan over the month or longer it takes you to go from your first kill to Nightbane, and Prince down. Then you either stagnate because you can't do anything more because you're don't have 25+ people, or your suddenly playing in an entirely different situation because now it's you and 24 of your closest friends instead of 9. Having two progression tracks for raiding that match eachother in terms of gear and challenge would be best, IMO.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TJ297</div><div class="date">2007-09-20, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO this game should hava a few changes.<br />
<br />
1. There should have been 2x 10 mans from the start and all of teir 4 should have been in these 2 instances. Then you have Gruul, Mag and SSC which could have T5 and then TK, Hijal and BT have T6. Obviously Gruul and TK would have been harder tho.<br />
<br />
2. Arena Gear is waaaaay too OP. Seriously, the gear should have been on par with Kara and when the new season came in, it should have just had a different 2 and 4 piece gear combo... I.E. rogues could have +3 secs to slice+dice and +1 Sec to KS in season 1 and in season 2 you get +10 dmg to sinister strike and +10 energy... All this could help players and give them incentive to get new gear.<br />
<br />
3. Arena Gear if it is like it is now, should have a restriction to not be useable outside of arenas and BG's. This would stop the PVPers QQing as they would get their exclusive gear and it would make PVE more of an accomplishment... ATM I dont have to upgrade my dagger till i kill Lady Vashj and get her dagger. Which wont happen too soon.<br />
<br />
4. Tailoring shouldn't have made pieces that are equal to T5... Make them equal to T4 stuff so there is still a reson to get it but then again it is easy to upgrade so it isnt a &quot;MUST HAVE&quot;. My priest is an Alchemist and I cant get this stuff so I am at a disadvantage from the start from choosing the wrong profession at lvl 1 in pre BC.<br />
<br />
5. 25 Mans should have been 20 mans. It is just common sense to have 2 kara groups form 1 Gruul group and so on... Currently, we have 2 Kara groups and 5 people that only get to go to Gruul's each week. Or we could invite more ppl get a 3rd Kara group going and we would have 5 ppl QQing that they dont get to go to Gruul which I must say is more fun than Kara which is a piece of piss...</div></div><hr />

And IMO you should stop living in 2005<br />
<br />
Point 1 is valid and about the only thing I, along with the majority agree: there should be more 10 man;<br />
<br />
Point 2 and 3, PVPer flooded the forums with tears claiming their gear sucks compare to drops from PVE raids, and that concern was valid. People should not have to &quot;raid or die&quot; and PVPer should not have to PVE in order to properly PVP. And there will be restriction on Arena gear accessibility come season 3, and finally they're buffing PVE gears again so that people don't necessarily have to PVP gear to PVE.<br />
<br />
Point 4, all the professions were joke pre-TBC and their only use is to make resistance gear. Even now LW and Engineering are still somewhat lacking, yet you want nerf them?! The crafting profession is designed to be a key feature of the game mind you.<br />
<br />
Point 5, in theory you have a point, but in real world(of warcraft), people have their own schedule and might not show up, ppl who finished gearing themselves in KZ won't want to go back, you need to change class setup and substitute ppl in and out when learning new encounters, your group setup is volatile enough that the &quot;extra 5&quot; actually is rarely a problem. And btw, KZ is viewed by many as one of the best instances.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">superdx</div><div class="date">2007-09-21, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On its own, KZ is a really good instance. It's 10 man, it's well-designed for that number, and it's definitely a step in the right direction to introduce more people to raiding. I enjoy seeing more guilds on our server progression actually raiding rather than only 5-6 guilds doing that content.<br />
<br />
However on a larger scale, especially in terms of raid progression, the organization and administration from going from 10-25 is just unbelievable and caused so much guild drama overall. I'd say this was the largest failure on Blizz's part. There should have been a logical step from the &quot;small&quot; raid zone to the &quot;large&quot; raid zone, especially in terms of numbers. If they wanted 25, then KZ should have been at least 12 people, just as an example. Then you can run 2 groups, combine them into one and you got your &quot;larger&quot; raid group. As it stands now, not only do you not have enough when you combine two KZ groups, you actually have to recruit more. Blizz needs to get it through it's head that guild management is a full time job, and they really REALLY dropped the ball on this one.</div></div><hr />

LW? Lacking? Dude I don't know what game you are playing.. I can craft 3 piece sets that rival and beat my Tier 4 chestpiece and provide belt/bracers for a 3 piece, and can still solve a 4 piece Tier 4 set just nicely.<br />
<br />
The Balance gear is nice, Hunter/Enhancement Shaman is scary, Feral/Rogue gear is insane.<br />

Well it is like the LWers pre-TBC if you wherent tribal or elemental you couldnt have this or that, truth is that many of us after TBC we got tailor and enchanting yes cause if you have the patience to farm the gazzilion primals to make you gear and enchant a thousand times with strenght your bracers ( mage) to lvl up yor enchanting so you can have the +12 spell on ring <br />
Many ppl say that the spellfire/shadoweave equavelant is Tier 6 I dont know if it is but I do know that it is good for me and I like it<br />

<br />
PVP Gear<br />
I still have some doubts - quite a few - if there should be any gear progression in arenas at all. But that would require a different concept from the successful gear based logic that is present in the remaining of the game. But the issue seems not so much to derive from top end gear being available in the arenas, but from being welfare epics. <br />
Resiliance was a step in the right direction, but it seems that further separation is needed :P.<br />
<br />
KZ<br />
Anyway, although KZ is a somewhat interesting instance - too much annoying trash and other not so interesting features to my taste though - guild/progression wise it is a bad thing. For starters I don't consider it a truly 10 man dungeon - to do all bosses you benefit a lot from changing party composition - so I put it more at 12 man dungeon. Then it is, imho, a bad entry point - ZG difficulty lvl for &quot;casual light raiding&quot; would be more adequate - not one shotting people. Finally - and this is the worst part - the way it divided guilds that were setting up for 25 man was just terrible. Bad idea altogether.<br />

Professions<br />
Tailoring is a bit too good for the games own good. While saying it is on T6 lvl is quite a bit of overstatement, fact is that a tailor should bypass most/all T4 gear - except if it was an &quot;excess drop&quot;. TBH I don't have a real problem with that (tailor = T4), except from the lock in it causes. I dropped herbalism to get tailoring and made it almost a requirement to be a tailor. Problem is how to make professions interesting and worthwhile without making them compulsory and overadvantageous? <br />
<br />
i'd give a few pointers to Blizzard (not that they should need any) - first of them is to restructure the way leveling goes so that they become cheaper to lvl - the end game epics should be expensive to make, not the leveling vendorized items that no one really wants.<br />
Another is to make most epic items tradable - expensive to make, but not BOP. That would cut on the lock in. Personally I didn't find the mats required for the tailored set to be over the top - adequate for such quality items, although a slight nudge from farmed mats (primals...) to &quot;unique&quot; (heroic mode drops) would be welcome.<br />
Finally introduce expendable addons to the profession made items - usable charges that consume some kind of item. Tailored sets, tailor made &quot;charges&quot;, LW sets, LW made... and so forth. A bit like the mana injector requires mana pots. The &quot;charges&quot; itself should be inexpensive, but would create a secondary market to those professions - something that only alchemy and - to an extent - enchanting have. <br />

Other TBC stuff<br />
<br />
Actually I find it hard to pin down what went wrong with TBC. Yes, there are all those little things combined but to be truthful I have that nagging sensation it is not only those objective point, but something a bit more elusive. In short TBC - particularly raiding - is less fun. I think that the only fight that I felt a common &quot;Wow - it is down!Yes!!!&quot; feeling similar to pre TBC was in Mag. Everyone else was more a &quot;Uuuf.. he is down&quot; (Lootreave didn't even granted that :P).<br />
<br />
Maybe with TBC Wow became too much &quot;professional&quot; to its own good.</div></div><hr />

Dude I don't know what game you are playing.. I can craft 3 piece sets that rival and beat my Tier 4 chestpiece and provide belt/bracers for a 3 piece, and can still solve a 4 piece Tier 4 set just nicely.<br />
<br />
The Balance gear is nice, Hunter/Enhancement Shaman is scary, Feral/Rogue gear is insane.<br />
<br />
Lacking isn't the word.<br />

Worth the time and effort for those epics.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tell me you're joking. Primalstrike is garbage. Only specialized LW set without sockets and the pieces are BARELY comparable to KZ/Gruul quality gear. Blizzard should've given the Primalstrike set the same amount of flexibility w/ sockets that the other LW sets got, instead of arbitrarily buffing the stats to make it suck less. The T5 patterns from SSC/TK have been decent, but anyone can learn those. <br />
<br />
I want some respectable Elemental LW patterns, because the itemization just plain sucks and I feel like I wasted my time picking up a worthless specialty.</div></div><hr />

Staying positive there i see.</div></div><hr />
