Blizzard is still working hard to make everyone happy and sent another wave of 250,000 Beta Invites, bringing the total to 550,000 Annual Pass Invites since the initial wave of beta testing!<br />
That’s right -- we’re in the process of sending 250,000 additional beta-test invites to Annual Pass holders. Keep an eye on your email and Battle.net account for an invitation to come test Mists of Pandaria with us.<br />
<br />
As with previous waves, it’s going to take a while for the invites to process, so we recommend checking your games list in Battle.net Account Management to see whether yours has arrived yet. Once it does, you’ll see the Mists of Pandaria beta client available for download from there. We expect this entire wave to take a day or so to complete.<br />
<br />
We appreciate the enthusiasm of everyone who signed up for the World of Warcraft Annual Pass, and we’re working hard to get you into the beta. We know you’re excited to explore Pandaria and test the new content, and we’ll keep you posted here in the forums when we’re ready to send out another wave.</div></div><hr />

When you signed up for the AP plays an immensely minor role in getting in. When your account was first created and how long it has been active is far more important.<br />

anyway right now there isnt much to test anyway.

This is what pisses me off.. It has nothing to do with when you created ur account or how long you've been active! it's all about when you bought the ap..<br />
People creating accounts in 07 and being inactive for a longer periode is getting in before others, just because they bought the ap at day 1.<br />

Boo-hoo? What make you think you are &quot;deserve&quot; more than others? Just because you've been on WoW account longer than other? Grow up kid and stop think nothing except yourself. You know what we call that? Selfishness. <br />

Yeah the whole seniority thing is bullshit, they're just picking random people. My wife's account never lapsed since it was created in early 08, annual pass since October.

This is the most frustrating thing, I've been a very loyal customer. Have every CE of every blizzard game that's had a CE released for it, have a day one account, yes literally day one, and had AP within a week of it going live due to being on the road during blizzcon. I can't possibly imagine that criteria puts me in the back half of a million. It's just very irritating to still not have an invite and watch people who made their account 3 years ago get invites, and then say &quot;LOL beta sucks anyway why do you care&quot; or while having their invite, sit in their ivory tower and complain about people who are excited to get one but are frustrated at the randomness of it.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, it's just random or atleast it seems like that by reading some of the posts.. Blizzard can't keep what they said but hey it's not like it's the first time this happens!<br />

also to the guy above me: ur paying blizz more not getting annual pass i do believe also u used to be able to get into beta without paying<br />

yes they did and they will. but only AFTER they get all the annual pass people in who were GUARANTEED access. i don't get why so many people can't accept the logic of letting people in who were told they were getting guaranteed access in before letting in the non-annual pass holders.</div></div><hr />

No. Some husband/wife(fiancee) combos have gotten double passes. So will give multiples to same address if different accounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like i posted when everyone (or at least the most vocal 'everyone') was smashing Blizzard saying that the whole annual pass thing is BS and this and that, they WILL invite EVERYONE who bought the ap. When you get your invite depends on when they decide to send you one not when you think you should have received one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First account created: A month or so after launch.<br />
Current account created: Patch 2.4.3 (Blizzard has on files that my other account is linked to this one.<br />
<br />
No beta club. I'm starting to get pissed.<br />
<br />
If it wasn't obvious yet, they completely lied about seniority.<br />
<br />
really? then how come i've seen no-1 post saying they have got in with an account any later then 2008? if they COMPLETELY lied about seniority there would be just as many people saying they've got it and only bought their account in 2009/10/11/12, but there aren't any, and i HIGHLY doubt that blizzard is going to bother looking through their files to see that you claimed that you had an account made a month or so after launch and link it to your 2.4.3 one, they are going to be ticking you off as if you made it in 2.4.3, my account was made at cata launch (though i had an old account that got hacked that i made right before BC launch) and i only got BETA in febuary so i know im going to be in the last wave but i don't care! because for 1, if you get in in any of these wave's you are not going to be able to do anything because they still only have a few servers and there will be tonnes of people getting in at once and the servers will be laggy and/or crash from the stress, though if you get in later they will more then likely have more servers up, most of the server lag/crash issues would of been worked out and all the people from the previous waves would of moved on by now, not to mention there will be MUCH more content to test later on, all you've got now is pandaren starting zone and the jade forest (85-86 pandaren zone), so just be patient for god's sake.<br />
<br />
And I am only going to say this once, THE INVITES FOR THIS WAVE HAVE NOT FINISHED YET, the blue poster estimated it will take a whole day to get sorted out! that is 24 hours estimated time and it has only been 1-2 hours since they announced it! that means only 5-10% (rough guess) of the total invites have been sent out! HAVE SOME FUCKING PATIENCE!</div></div><hr />

<br />
(I did suspect that Blizzard wanted to get quite a lot of new testers in before the holiday, I'm glad that they didn't have any issues preventing that from happening)<br />
<br />
Grats new testers, see you in-game!</div></div><hr />

Yeah get in when there is no testing left to do because Blizz is cheap and intentionally dumping 250000 people on 4 measly servers.<br />

<br />
Because no matter what they say they're doing to determine who gets in...they're full of it. There is zero rhyme or reason (other than having the AP) to being invited first.</div></div><hr />

this clearly says they arent just pooling from AP users. Not that I am surprised. But I am running out of patience. I know the wave is supposed to go out over the next 24 hours but You can be pretty certain that They all went out pretty much immediately. so. any of you gotten one just show up in your f5 spamming?</div></div><hr />

<br />
TL;DR: You agreed to continually pay for a WoW subscription for a year. Not doing so could mean you lose the benefits of the Annual Pass.<br />
<br />
Diablo 3 isn't even out yet and a good majority of the people complaining aren't even in the MoP beta so tell me...what exactly are they going to be losing now??</div></div><hr />

The randomness is very random. I'm Jan '07 as well and no invite yet, incidentally.</div></div><hr />

You just don't get it do you? Ofc people will think this way and I don't blame em...<br />
<br />
When you get as big as blizzard, it's stupid to think otherwise!<br />
<br />
Kinda like the same thing when you've been working for the same company for ages, you will be feeling entitled to promotions, raises, health insurance etc etc. I know I woulda been very disapointed if some random dude just came along and got my promotion outta the blue..</div></div><hr />
