Valor Point Item Upgrades<br />
In Mists of Pandaria, Valor Points can be used to upgrade your gear. This feature is not in the game yet and not intended to be previewed at this time. All of the numbers used here are fake (except the item level 375 requirement) and for demonstration purposes only. <br />
<br />
<br />
The minimum item level to upgrade gear is 375.<br />
The left side shows the gear item level (500) and the player's item level (489).<br />
The right side shows the increase in item level, and the new item level (525) and player's item level (491).<br />
Right now all stats are upgraded, you can see the increase in individual stats on the right side (+35) and the new stat amount (255).<br />
This example only shows one stat, but in the final product all of the stats on an item will be increased.<br />
Each item has a limited number of times it can be upgraded, which is shown at the top right (2/3), with the upgrade cost directly above it (300). <br />

South Korea Bans Botting<br />
The South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism is preparing a new law that will outlaw virtual item trades and farming items for commercial use in games. This new law is supposed to encourage students to avoid wasting time and improve the environment of games. The law prohibits players from using software that allows characters to farm items in a game without the need for a human to be playing. <br />
<br />
The article in The Korea Times (http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2012/06/129_112964.html) doesn't make it very clear, but this ban may also impact Arcade games that sell something you have to physically go and purchase to redeem for an item in game.<br />
<br />
The Ministry claims that the &quot;main purpose of the games is for entertainment and should be used for academic and other good purposes&quot;, which doesn't include farming items for money! They also mentioned that virtual item trades contribute to many problems in society, including teenage crime. The police department is supposed to enforce this law which has a maximum punishment of a $43,000 USD fine and up to five years in prison. <br />

Forced Cross Realm PVP<br />
When we go live, cross realm zones won't put PvP and PvE realms together.<br />
<br />
During beta testing, you're going to see a lot of crazy stuff. Please keep in mind that beta is not a demo of the game. It is a testing environment in which we can get feedback from players but also in which we can test out many of our new features, some of which, like this one, are quite technically complex. <br />
<br />
If you find yourself overly frustrated by the chaotic nature of beta, whether it's from cross-realm testing, broken quests or class bugs, my suggestion would be to wait until we launch. It's not worth getting frustrated over. You'll have plenty of opportunities to explore Pandaria. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/227163-feedback-forced-pvp/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5826322628?page=10#198))<br />

Rogue Feedback<br />
He hasn't answere anything about the Prep/Step issue. <br />
Again, I feel like we have made plenty of responses to the topic. I think it's one of those deals where because some players don't like the answer, they say the topic has not been addressed.<br />
<br />
For the record, as many players will tell you, Sub is nearly impossible to balance with both Preparation and Shadowstep. On the other hand, having two talents that are both so good that you want them both and have to think long and hard about which one to take and perhaps even swap back and forth from time to time is pretty much exactly what we are trying to deliver with the new talent system. Are rogues doomed in PvP without both? I doubt that. Is it hard t o choose? Of course, and that's the point. If we conclude that it's just too cruel to ask rogues to choose between them, we'd likely just cut Prep from the game and perhaps lower a few cooldowns slightly. I really hope though that we aren't in a space where every cool talent has to become mandatory or deleted.<br />
<br />
Leeching and paralytic locking each other out<br />
Again, asked and answered. We said that we understand that very optimized rogues won't want both talents because you can only use one at a time. That depends a very great deal on how often you'd use the competing talents. If you find yourself using leeching poison then swapping to paralytic often, you may be better off just keeping both talents than constantly swapping. A Disc priest (on live) doesn't necessarily drop the Atonement talent evey time they think they might not Smite, though very min/max players probably do.<br />
<br />
We're going to be underfunded for the first patch of MoP<br />
Do you have any evidence of this? Even anecdotes are better than nothing (though not much better). The classes on beta are getting pretty well balanced at this point at both level 85 and 90 (modulo the occasional bug that creeps in), so if you think you're seeing something we're not, please let us know.<br />
<br />
As an aside, I'm not a huge fan of simulations as evidence, because it requires us to debug them first. I used to spend more effort doing that, but it's a chore, and my time is probably better spent elsewhere. Sims are fantastic for suggesting to you that you might want to try a different rotation or stat allocation. They aren't great for &quot;Hey Bliz, my dps is low. Please buff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dirty Tricks just sounds like a bug. I don't have our bug database in front of me, but it's hard to make assumptions about neglect based on when a bug gets fixed, so long as it does before launch. It could be that the developer is waiting on a code change to fix the bug. It could be that he or she is pondering how to fix it or if a redesign in the functionality (not the base design) is warranted.<br />
<br />
I've been doing this a long time, and one of the truths I have uncovered is that apparently easy bugs are often the hardest to fix and things you predict would take weeks of programming time can be done in a few lines. It's hard to diagnose from the outside.<br />
<br />
If you see bugs, report them in the bug forum. Once you have done so, stop worrying about it until we get close to launch. <br />

It's the best thing they've come up with since introducing valor points.<br />
<br />
Loot should only drop from raids, and valor should enhance the gear but not boost your way into raiding.<br />
<br />
As for pvp everything stays the same, you get honor, conquest and elite gear with the same acquiring as currently on live.</div></div><hr />

I doubt it, in my opinion. Legendaries are neat for a couple of patches and then bite the dust. I'm not saying make them BiS, but legendaries ought to be timeless bad-@$$es.

On the subject of botting, I'm not sure how they will enforce it. They will have to spend an enormous amount of resources to go through each case unless they are specifically detected by Warden. :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, there is that obvious route. But Blizzard depends a lot on other players reporting the bad behavior and taking a long time to investigate, and who is to say Blizzard Entertainment has been provided truthful account information by the account holder? It just seems to me that they (the violators) could claim it was not them at the time. Does the law compel them to provide the wrong-doers?<br />
<br />
It's a bit of a nice idea, but has some practical issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I can't speak for South Korean law, I find it hard to believe that with laws against botting they wouldn't have laws similar to the ones passed in the UK compelling companies to aid in investigations or even more recently relating to ISPs, to aid companies find out who illegally downloaded their copyrighted material.<br />

They could easily claim it wasn't them but then the issue of account sharing being forbidden could come into play :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or it's not expected that you fully upgrade all your gear always.<br />
<br />
From what I've gathered what Blizzard doesn't like is Valor spikes in value early in a content patch then falls off steadily. Eventually nobody's running dungeons because they don't need the gear Valor purchases. This changes the demand for Valor to be more constant. I'm sure different guilds will have varying expectations from their players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In a good way, there are more means to use VP. Using DS as example, and assuming I didn't carry forward T12 HC gear. I would start by buying the cloak and relic (BiS as no drops in DS), then rings x2 (random rings drops are awesome chances), then after that, may be neck/bracer/boots, however that will depends if raid drops being nice to me, I was lucky to get raid drop boots and bracer rather quickly so didn't have to waste time to buy those. And I will be getting tier from raids so wouldn't buy any of the pieces with VP, so, I am already done with VP. The new VP usage will give us more use for VP before you see bracers boots and other future VP BoE being flooded everywhere.<br />
<br />
However use can also be limited. From what we see, 1 items can upgrade 2-3 times (and possible that each item varies), however, would you really upgrade a LFR piece? I know I wouldn't, normal piece? If it is something I am likely to use for a LONG time (belt from Spine for example, lasted me long time before we killed Spine HC), then may be, otherwise, unless it is HC raid gear, I probably won't bother upgrading (pretty much how I treat epic gems). And if many people do the same, then the issue pretty much isn't solved in anyway at all as all the HC raiders will just save up enough VP for when they do get a HC raid drop to upgrade it to max.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard explained before why this was going to happen: imagine you do a full run of the current raid instance on week, and you get absolutely no gear, you can always upgrade your old gear. It's not supposed to be exactly as strong as a new item, but its something..</div></div><hr />

Gear dropping from boss kills is probably the best way to obtain &quot;stepping stone&quot; loot. ***incoming tangent***I wish loot mattered less though, good players just play differently, give the player a tool to use during the fight that when used correctly will provide an 50% survival rate where the remaining 50% is split 30/20 respectively, between player positioning/ coordinated movement and gear . so that way if you didn't get the best optimized set its ok because you have a clear grasp on the fight mechanics, which more important anyway.</div></div><hr />

I wonder what sort of restrictions will be implemented with regards to the current BiS gear. Upgrading one of the current level 397 non-heroic items would make that item BiS, and upgrading a heroic 410 item would almost certainly make that item overpowered. Surely there is more to this than we understand right now.</div></div><hr />

There's also random heroics and dailies - and there's no limit on the number of dailies you can do in a day. 5 VP a quest isn't great, but it's better than nothing. Presumably the weekly cap will stay, and those of us who aren't clearing all the raids right away can still cap out, provided we're willing to put in an effort - which is not really different than it is now.<br />
<br />
It WILL help those of us who have horrible luck with drops. A good example would be caster shaman helms in Firelands. Ragnaros was your only choice. Being able to upgrade the previous tier's helm would have offset some of the frustration in either not getting to Ragnaros for a while, or it just not dropping when you did kill him.<br />
<br />
However, it's not going to help stat bloat. We'll definitely need an item squish next expansion.</div></div><hr />

If you would only just read for once instead of only looking at pictures, you'd know the numbers were made up.<br />
<br />
I think the numbers might start high, but they'll become smaller each time u use an upgrade, ex :<br />
<br />
1/3 = 15 ilvl<br />
2/3 = 10 ilvl<br />
3/3 = 05 ilvl<br />

Yes, and and the valor cost of 300 is made up and could be anything from 5 to 1'000 valor. heck it could be something other than valor used, like some rep token instead.<br />
and the 2/3 is made up, could be a single upgrade or 10 upgrades per item too.<br />
and the ilv jump is made up, could be a single ilvl per upgrade to 50ilvl, who knows ?<br />
and the stat jump is also made up, heck could be anthing really, why not a +100 agi instead.<br />
actually the pic is mostly useless and doesn't tell us anything else that gear will be upgradable is some way or an other.<br />

Oh and about the upgrade, I would say it is to compensate for certain gear that on the table but never drops for the group, to remove some RNG factor on raid progression.<br />
But given the price now (900 for 3/3?), I would say it is a little too cheap. No way upgrading a LFG chest is cheaper than buying a brand new valor chest.</div></div><hr />

My understanding of it that Blizzard didn't like having 2 currencies to buy gear with, the last I heard was that justice was used to buy items and valor was going to be used to upgrade items.

Originally the idea was to give players that couldn't get that one piece to drop an alternate route to a piece. Now it's just going to be another step extending the 'acquire, enchant, gem, transmog (whatever)' process as well as put a limit on it.<br />

What if, for example, your current head piece from a previous tier is upgraded a full 3/3 times, and in the newer tear, a new helmet drops. What if it is not nearly as good as your current 3/3 helm? What if the only way for this new item to be an upgrade over your current helm, it needs to be upgraded 3 times itself? (ie. currently, an item you just obtain in a raid is not better than your current item until you gem it, enchant it, and reforge it. Absolutely unreal.)<br />
<br />
This just seems to me like another needless grind. My bet is this will just end up being another form of enchantments, another form of gems, another form of reforging. It's getting ridiculous now. When everyone is enticed to do the same exact thing, it doesn't matter. What's the point of this? It is a needless grind because EVERYONE has access to it, not just for something like legendary items. In order for you to keep up with the pack, you'll need to upgrade your gear fully. This is artificial lengthening of a game. <br />
<br />
As the saying goes: when everyone's special, no one is.<br />
<br />
What I would have liked this system to be, would have been a way to upgrade from your old valor items to the new tier of valor items. You can either buy the new item with valor points, or you can upgrade your old item (only one upgrade per tier) with valor points at a cheaper price. Just a simple trade in + extra valor. Reduce the grind, not lengthen it. I can't imagine the ridiculous confusion that will arise under the current definition.</div></div><hr />

Yeah they messed up with this one, considering EVE is a PC game. I'd love to get into the EVE universe, but sadly I don't have a PS3, nor do I like shooters on consoles. But, CCP always says &quot;we're launching exclusively on PS3&quot; which could hopefully be translated to &quot;we'll come out on PS3 first and later to PC &amp; Xbox&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also considering both Microsoft and Sony are bound to announce new console hardware next year, the PS3 will get replaced in 1-2 years, so they are bound to bring it out on the PC which is the most stable system for MMO games, where a hardware refresh doesn't suddenly make you unable to play the game like going from PS3 to PS4, but that's speculation. <br />

Do you seriously beg for less farming in wow? Farming is what most of people lack currently. <br />
<br />
what is more fun: <br />
<br />
Either get all your gear without the need to upgrade, meaning that you can get your complete head solt within one raid run, takes 1hr max.<br />
Or, get your piece, and then in addition have the ability to improve it by farming more and using more time to achieve better gear.<br />
<br />
It seems that you just want the last boss dead in heroic without giving any endurance tries.<br />
MMOs are supposed to be grind farms, and i approve of this thing. Only wonder if it works on pvp gear too. <br />

I'm not sure it'll be an issue. For non-hardcore guilds, if someone needs the helm more than you then pass it up for them and you pick it up later (although just like everything this has a chance of drama). For hardcore guilds it will be assumed you're min/maxing and will do all those steps you list to get the best out of gear. I agree the addition of &quot;prospect upgrades&quot; will take some time for players to get used to though.<br />
<br />

Upgrading an t14 heroic drop like this will probably brake the game even in t15 ...<br />
<br />
did you notice that they said that the numbers are just made up?....</div></div><hr />

Your ISP will have your identity anyway, if the authority demands it.<br />
Unless you are tipped-off, no way they can decrypt and scan every data in their internet. <br />
Even tracking plain text for &quot;terrorist threat&quot; is problematic for those national security services with unknown budget.<br />

I'd say its just China's RWT ban v2.</div></div><hr />

Yeah they did :) But the Korean version of D3 doesn't have RMAH implemented and never will and neither was the plan.<br />

Also they need to make legendary weapons usable for transmog.</div></div><hr />

In the United States, it's legal to have sex. It's illegal to pay for it.<br />
<br />
In South Korea, it's legal to play MMOs and earn items through gameplay. It's illegal to pay for them.<br />
<br />
I don't think your mind should be boggling quite that much. I don't agree with the law but it's certainly not an unheard of violation of personal freedoms. It's basically tantamount to anti-gambling laws.</div></div><hr />

Reforging already takes care of that.<br />
Upgrade is just that, upgrade.<br />
<br />
I find it a very nice method to get rid of excessive VP's that already amass like hell.<br />
Instead of spending them on BoE at least now you got something decent to do with the excess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe legendaries can actually gain some value again if they become upgradeable the requirements can go up(lower droprate, more hardmode bosses needed), but you can upgrade them so legendaries acquired early in the expansion won't be useless 1 or 2 tiers later. as long as the price is right, 3000vp each upgrade on your legendary weapon, that will keep the casuals away as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see many problems with this. First is with the sentence. It does not fit the crime in any way shape or form. Are they really gonna fill their jails with botters rather than put an actual felon in who presents a real threat to society? Or do they currently have a problem with empty jail cells and bored prison guards? Maybe we should send over some of our rapists and murderers and show them real crime catalysts.<br />
<br />
Second is their ways of reporting. If blizzard/a GM finds a botter and he happens to be from south korea, tattling can seriously eff up someones life! All over a piece of virtual plant and ore? This brings a person to a new low: ruining someones life litereally over a game. I see that this will actually decrease their subscribers. Maybe not by a huge number, but by a handful of accounts. I'd really like to see their data that it contributes to teen crime because while its cutting corners and being dishonest, in no way can I fathom that it's a 'gateway drug' to assault, RL theft, vandalism, or any other crime.<br />
<br />
Well...farewell botters. All those days that I contemplated buying gold might be the lighter side of days as I'm sure there will be fewer and fewer of you spamming trade, and less and less opportunities to actually do such.</div></div><hr />

1st. It's beta.<br />
2nd. I agree. Rogues are supposed to be mobile, but not mobile wreckingballs. I feel that preparation vs shadowstep is a good toss up. Preparation can be suited for HUGE burst fights, while on the other hand, shadowstep provides consistent pressure.</div></div><hr />
