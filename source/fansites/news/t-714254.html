You probably remember my post in November about a Taiwanese player who had all the achievements in the game. A few months later, Caspi from Refuge (EU-Taerar) reaches a new record and is the first player to complete all the achievements currently available in-game, including a 25-man heroic Lich King kill. Congratulations to him!

You don't have any life savings, that's why I didn't make it happen in May. Technically, it's your fault if people have to wait for the Alpha.<br />

<br />
Seriously though, congrats to the guy for &quot;beating&quot; World of Warcraft! Now, put him on some of these other games with their so-called &quot;Achievement&quot; system, like Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10.... Or better yet, let's see how many XBox &quot;achievement points&quot; he can get :)</div></div><hr />

To me it seems more like an unhealthy obsession to attack someone for how much time they've invested in WoW. I bet half the people here play just as much (maybe more) but spend most of their time doing nothing but sitting around Dalaran socializing in Trade. :P<br />

When the beta invites go out the player will be given the link to download the client for the beta. Once the beta download is complete generally you can log straight in as the servers are live once the beta invites go out. There can be stability issues where the login server of the beta can go down and you end up waiting a day or so before you can acctually play however, it really depends on the stability of the client then anything else and whether it can take the people logging onto it</div></div><hr />

Probably did those achievements before WoTLK, when they were easier (can't be arsed to look it up though.)<br />
<br />
It's a pretty interesting accomplishment though, should get something special for it. Like a robot unicorn mount, only for those hardcore enough to get all achievements. Or a Garfield mini-pet, it can save you from any mob out for blood and lastly a title like &quot;the supreme&quot;.</div></div><hr />

also his Commander title, which you had to get pre-tbc, and you should have earned with the launch of achievements, he got march 31<br />
<br />
many others are march 31, he probably bugged, and had a gm restore?</div></div><hr />

i mean.. have been in WSG, AB, and AV long enough to be exalted, but not been able to get killing blows on all the different races??<br />
Strikes me as odd..<br />
<br />
and Could someone clarify to me how he did get &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot;, &quot;Brewmaster&quot;, &quot;The Flame Warden&quot;, &quot;Pilgrim&quot; and etc on 31.03.2010? <br />

He used to be in terrordar as an orc hunter. I guess his final achievement was the lich king so he migrated to a server where he could achieve such an encounter. Nothing bad about that and respect for spending so much time and dedication. Few people will ever make this :D</div></div><hr />

Proud owner of the 2009 Vintage Green Brewfest Stein.<br />
03-24-2010 (he didnt activated the account that day (31), so it isnt a bug)<br />
<br />
And nearly all achievements of pvp are on 03/31<br />
<br />
I do believe he has beaten tlk, and he is kickass, but I find that coincidence too suspicious for believing he has gained all the achievements.<br />
<br />
I won't bother cheking up more, but lol, gz cracking the ass of the armory xD (btw, my 2 cents)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason he has all those achievements at that date is because he would have faction transfered. <br />
<br />
I know this because my character faction transfered and got all those achievements which involve the opposite faction which are different. http://wowarmory.com/character-achievements.xml?r=Nagrand&amp;n=Quetz See for yourself, look at the Strange Trip achy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the only thing where you have to play a littl bit is the pve heroic 25 lk kill but even that doesnt mean he has to have no life &gt;_&lt; <br />
players from top guilds usually raid alot for a few weeks and then they go like &quot;1 day a week farming all hardmodes ingame&quot; while you still random group 4 evenings a week and cry about them have no life ::)<br />
all the other achievements are farming and shit but not that time consuming either, im sure you can get most of the farming shit in 6 months by playing only 2 days a week<br />
the pvp achievemtns are a mix of skill and friends(opposite faction) and are relative easy with some help<br />
100k honor kills arent that hard to achieve either if you play that char for a very long time, if i wouldn'd be the alt-King of world of warcraft...., im sure if i'd add up all kills from all my chars i'd have 200k kills :P<br />
<br />
dunt see any no life in having achieved that, apart from skill and dedication to continue playing one character forever :P<br />
<br />

Its because people dont understand how to read posts before posting themselves. Just like people dont read stickies *cough RaF thread cough* and then have their posts deleted or locked.<br />

It's been posted before of course: Transfer / Race Change can do that to achievements. Look at some of his pvp achievements: All the same date</div></div><hr />

<br />
#2 there is a rule that which most people must understand is being applied in this particular situation. If my gear/achievement score is better than yours, I'm a better player. If your gear/achievement score is better than mine, you have no life.<br />
<br />
Also just to throw out some numbers if you use the assumption that his play time is 500 days. Averaging between the North American release and the European release of Vanilla you get an average playtime between 6 to 7 hours a day everyday. Thats the kind of dedication it takes to beat the game.<br />
<br />
Once again congrats.</div></div><hr />

Haha! You call what he/she has done an &quot;achievement&quot;. Best part about all of this is, all the time he/she spent wasting his life on stupid meaningless achievements can be easily recreated by Blizzard with a couple of keystrokes.<br />
<br />
I laugh when I hear people wasting time on casual MMOs, such as WoW. I mean, if you're going to every waking hour on an MMO, you might as well pick an MMO that actually gives you an in-game advantage for all the time spent. What do you get in WoW? A stupid achievement or mount? Hell, even Runescape is more 'hardcore' than WoW. At least in Runescape, if you spend every waking hour playing it, you literally have an advantage over tons of other players in events such as PvP.<br />
<br />
Yep, Runescape &gt; World of Warcraft! How hilarious!!</div></div><hr />

He didn't say &quot;Testing has begun&quot;, but that the F&amp;F phase has begun. That could mean F&amp;F is the first phase.. or perhaps it's the &quot;next phase&quot;... perhaps there WAS an internal Alpha.. which is complete. Perhaps because of past &quot;leaks&quot; F&amp;F THIS time around means a short 1-2 week test of copying peeps, initial zone stability, etc... followed by the &quot;Closed Beta&quot; that is chosen from Option peeps.<br />
<br />
The 2nd part: &quot;The closed beta test phase has not yet started, but we will provide updated information when it does.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seems too loose.. why would you feel the need to say F&amp;F has begun... then say Beta has not.. unless you somehow personally feel there's not a lot of difference and feel you need separate them more.<br />
<br />
Bottom line... the post didn't &quot;Settle down&quot; the maases for a wait... but felt more like a &quot;Beta didn't start.... today... tee hee.. but somewhere in the future... tee hee&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
In other words.. if &quot;I&quot; had made the statement it would have been worded more like:<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed F&amp;F Alpha testing has begun! But to be clear this is NOT open to users who have opted-in for Beta testing via Battle.net. Once we feel the F&amp;F phase has brought us to a level where we can test a larger player base, we will announce details for the &quot;Closed Beta&quot; and those chosen from the opt-in database will be notified.&quot;<br />

I'm sorry, but what you're asking for is counter intuitive. You're posting news and asking people not to comment about them, or if they want to comment it, to do so only if they share a certain kind of approach to them.<br />
<br />
There's been a lot of bad &quot;no life&quot; messages for sure, but you could easily weed them out for reasons like spamming or not contributing to the thread, or bad signatures. Anything is better than &quot;your ideas are not welcome here&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
getting 1054 achievements is getting them all. that's why blizzard made it out of that many achievements. feats of strength are made as such for a reason, whether it be requiring ridiculous rng, or no longer being possible.<br />
<br />
your argument does not hold water. 1054/1054 of achievements is all of them, feats of strength are different. go argue with blizzard.</div></div><hr />

What you are saying makes no sense. You need 1054/1054 like Caspi (and only Caspi).<br />
<br />
People should read at least a page before viewing. I guess Iapeto, who also faction changed awhile back, also cheated to get 1052/1054....<br />
<br />
http://www.wowarmory.com/character-achievements.xml?r=Bleeding%20Hollow&amp;n=Iapeto<br />
<br />
As I posted before, here is a gallery of screenshots contributed by Caspi to the interview he had with WoW.com back on March 23, 2010 which shows him getting many difficult achievements. This is pre-faction change, which should be evident to the knowledgeable people here.<br />

So to those saying &quot;has no life&quot;, well you may want to double check that because you may not realize how close to the truth you really are with that statment if the reason Blizzard gave him most the achievments because of some life threatening illness...<br />

Again for all I know he may just be a hacker or a kid of an employee but point is though he may have all the achievements he didn't really complete them all (not going to say earn them all because that may not be true).<br />

Edit: &quot;The reason for this is faction change, whic&quot;... maybe that is why, maybe just the way they are done during a faction change caused all to be 3-31-10, but unless killing say the SW raid leader converts to killing the Orgramar raid leader highly unlikely because order of complettion was &quot;For the alliance&quot; then killing BE leader... ok yes when you complete last step of a meta the meta completes before the last step but then he has the UC boss then TB then Orgramar... so unless he got all 4 of those spontaniously the oder in the armory should have been BE,UC,TB,Meta,Org and not Meta,BE,UC,TB,Org</div></div><hr />

You probably remember my post in November (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/player-gets-all-achievements-shadowed-unit-frames/) about a Taiwanese player who had all the achievements in the game. A few months later, Caspi from Refuge (EU-Taerar) (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Taerar&amp;cn=Caspi&amp;gn=Refuge) reaches a new record and is the first player to complete all the achievements currently available in-game, including a 25-man heroic Lich King kill.

Whilst I do agree that completeing all achievements does take time and effort, I don't really think you have to spend an insane amount of hours per day. Achievements have existed for more than 20,000 hours and Vanilla-players like Caspi got thousands of points the very first day through retroactive achievments. The guild he's in also has the goal to do all dungeon&amp;raid achievements. Their guild leader is Zoltan, the first person ever to reach 10k acheivement points.<br />
<br />
What it takes, is efficiency and luck, the luck obviously for seasonal achievments like A Mask For All Occasions. Efficiency is about not standing around in Dalaran for 45 minutes dancing and waiting for a raid, but instead go out and, say, complete a number of quests in a tactical way (making sure you don't have to go to the same place twice for two different quests). <br />
<br />
I'm not saying getting all achievements is easy, it's very hard. I'm just saying it doesn't require you to play for 15 hours a day.</div></div><hr />
