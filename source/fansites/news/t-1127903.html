Fishing: The Anglers<br />
The Anglers is a new faction in Mists of Pandaria that is all about fishing. Their main encampment can be found off the coast in Krasarang Wilds on an island called Angler's Wharf. Nat Pagle is fishing there and will sell you the faction rewards. There are several quests associated with The Anglers, some daily and some normal quests, but all of them require level 89 or greater. <br />

A Lack of Cloth Healing Gear in Dungeons<br />
Our item designers spend a lot of effort making sure there is gear for everyone, so if you haven't seen a specific piece you might have just gotten unlucky. <br />
<br />
Note however that healer cloth is any cloth without hit on it. If you are expecting Spirit on every single piece, you might be disappointed. If you did manage to get Spirit on every single piece, you might find that your regeneration is higher than you really need for level up content. We know we can't make the level up dungeons super challenging, or players will just skip them and quest instead (given that even the most awesome level up dungeon gear won't last very long, so it's not possible to offer high reward for high risk). <br />
<br />
As you are nearing level 90, and start gearing for end game content, stats for healers and survival stats for tanks start to become more important and you should find more of them. <br />
<br />
Also, don't neglect the vendors. Their gear isn't best in slot by any stretch, but can be useful to fill any holes if you missed a piece or have just been unlucky.

Hunter Feedback<br />
A few points on hunters, gathered from several threads:<br />
<br />
We don't want for dots just to ignore crowd control. It's a test of skill for players to decide when to dot and when to CC. However, that's not a fair requirement for attacks that you can't prevent, such as Piercing Shots and MM mastery. Those probably do need to pause or do no damage to CC'd targets.<br />
<br />
We're still tweaking focus regen. It does feel a little slow right now.<br />
<br />
Stampede needs to appear at the target or you lose too much of the brief duration with the pets moving to the target. It also needs to have a long cooldown and short duration, because it's an awful lot of DPS to have so many pets out. The alternative would be that the extra pets do a lot less damage each, but we didn't feel like that really delivered on the fantasy of &quot;opening the stable.&quot;<br />
<br />
We want traps to be good CC. Traps are one of the signature hunter mechanics, and we'd rather make them good than just let players ignore them and do all their CC with shots. Improving CC in this way will also give hunters better synergy with other classes in PvP, rather than the hunter's viability being determined by how awesome their burst damage is.<br />
<br />
We're still looking at expertise, dodge and running a lot of PvP tests right now. We do think it's a bit disingenuous to argue that melee are always behind their targets in PvP. Just ask any Backstabbing rogue or Shredding druid. Overall, we're still comfortable with the idea of ranged attacks able to be dodged. It's a little weird to argue any of this stuff based on &quot;reality&quot; but heroes so awesome that they could dodge arrows or bullets certainly exist in literature and cinema. If you can leap through the air towards your foe (or backwards in the case of a hunter), shield block a giant, or cast a fireball, then being able to dodge a shot shouldn't be the thing that breaks the suspension of disbelief. <br />
<br />
(As an aside, when I was working on historical RTS games, I read that there was some evidence that Native Americans had some skill in dodging arrows, which may have been one of the things that led to their adopting firearms, given that firearms at the time were pretty inferior to arrows or javelins in most other ways. That still doesn't settle whether dodging arrows in a fantasy game with paladins and mages is reasonable or not.)<br />
<br />
If it's an undue burden for PvP, then that's another thing (though we think the jury is still out on that), but arguing it's not realistic is a bit... er... dodgy. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/222183-hunter-mop-beta-feedback-and-the-future/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4768328459?page=2#35))<br />

Rapture Must Retire<br />
We don't think Rapture is &quot;fundamentally flawed.&quot; We also added it back because so many Disc priests asked for it. It's challenging for us to present a design when some players want something and some don't want it.<br />
<br />
Discipline would struggle if the spec was designed around flawless Rapture use, but it's not. Meditation is still there and in fact a Disc priest with flawless Rapture use would have more mana return than other healers. A priest who totally ignored PW:Shield would have lower mana return, but why are you playing Disc if you ignore PW:Shield? For many Disc priests who say benefit from Rapture every 20+ sec instead of the minimum 12, their sustainability should be comparable to other healers. Keep in mind what I said in the other thread about considering the entire package; the only real measurement of sustainability is how long the various healers can cast in average (low HPS) and scary (high HPS) situations without going OOM.

Discipline Feedback<br />
In the (hopefully) next build you receive, Discipline again has Greater Heal, Strength of Soul, and Power Word: Shield with no cooldown. We are also trying something really different with Spirit Shell. Let us know how it feels.

Warrior Feedback<br />
Here are some warrior comments from various threads. I know there is at least one very long thread, but in my experience players are less likely to read huge threads. I mean no disrespect to any other posters by posting here.<br />
<br />
1) We want rage to be a mechanic. We don't want rage to be something warriors ignore because they can just hit all of their buttons whenever they want. That tends to lead towards the class being cooldown controlled. It's fine for some classes to work that way (Enhance shaman are pretty close), but that's not our vision for warriors.<br />
<br />
2) We think the rate of rage income in Battle Stance is currently about right, but we knew that warriors could totally ignore Heroic Strike and Cleave, so we've been tweaking things like Enrage providing more rage, so that being rage capped is more of a risk (allowing smarter warriors to bleed off that rage with HS).<br />
<br />
3) The Berserker Stance redesign is still pretty new and something we're adjusting. If we are successful, then warriors will use Battle Stance much of the time, but would consider Berserker for PvP or boss fights with an excessive amount of raid damage. We aren't looking for warriors to constantly stance dance, nor do we want them to be in Berserker all of the time.<br />
<br />
4) Your entire class doesn't need to revolve around having X amount of crit. We will balance warrior damage around whatever stats are available at various character and gear levels. We like the fact that warriors will have more Enrage uptime as they acquire more crit. Mechanics like that are the kind of thing that make gearing up more fun, because it can actually impact your rotation a bit rather than hitting the same buttons the same way as you did when you were level 86. Warriors (especially Fury) need some amount of crit and Enrage uptime to function, but giving them too high a crit rate early on leads to devaluing the stat in later tiers of gear. (This goes for a lot of stats on a lot of classes.)<br />
<br />
5) We run DPS tests all the time both at level 85 with starter gear and level 90 with end-game gear. The numbers are in a pretty good place, though we'll continue to adjust them as we make class changes and refine rotations. I offer that because saying &quot;My DPS is terrible,&quot; doesn't really give us much information. What is your DPS? Who are you comparing it to?<br />
<br />
6) Target dummies are great for learning your rotation. They are terrible for trying to predict how your rotation will feel in scenarios, dungeons, raids or PvP, and that is one of the reasons we went so long before adding them. Please try to get a feel for how your class plays in a group setting before coming to conclusions about whether you have enough buttons to hit or are waiting around too long. (Again, this is not a warrior-only consideration.)<br />
<br />
7) I probably sound like a broken record here (&quot;What's a &quot;record,&quot; GC?&quot;), but we don't want warriors or any class to be able to just pick DPS talents and forsake all others. If you are a DPS dude choosing a damage talent instead of a tanking talent, then you probably don't really have much in the way of a choice. If you focus on relatively easy content where you never need a survival button, never need to help out an ally, and never need crowd control, then I can understand why the talent choices may not be as interesting to you. On the other hand, try some of those 2-3 pulls in Townlong or run a scenario without a tank before you cement those opinions.<br />
<br />
8) For tanks, the goal of active mitigation is to let you translate your resource (rage in this case) into survival. If you use Shield Block or Shield Barrier frequently, you'll be a better tank. If you spam them whenever possible, you'll do fine for scenarios and Raid Finder. To do more challenging content, you're going to want to use them at the right time, which may mean delaying them a few seconds for when a big hit is coming. Shield Block isn't designed to keep you alive all by itself -- fortunately you have plenty of emergency cooldowns. We also don't want players just learning the class or running easier content to crumple just because they failed to keep Shield Block up as much as possible. Many factors go into making you an effective tank -- watch a video of some of the world's best tanks if you don't believe me. Spamming Shield Block isn't going to cut it. Using Shield Block intelligently will help some. <br />
<br />
9) I know it's fun to brainstorm new abilities. Just understand that such feedback is much less useful to the designers than commenting on how existing things feel. The frustration of missing a Mortal Strike in PvP and having that shut down your entire rotation (just to use an example) is great feedback and the kind of thing we can easily address. &quot;Hey, I came up with a new ability or resource, what do you guys think?&quot; is cool and all, but less likely to lead to an action item for our team.<br />
<br />
10) Please don't expect or demand regular posts like this. The team has a lot to before we're ready to ship this expansion. We will read and take seriously all of your feedback, but we just can't afford to spend hours making forum posts. Just because I made a warrior post today and not a warlock post doesn't mean your feedback is being ignored or that we don't love you.<br />
<br />
I don't use mathematics, which seems to be the devs' lingua franca; but I can work with spatial/systemic concepts instead, so that's how I communicate.<br />
It’s not necessary to use numbers if you want to give feedback on how a rotation feels. (Though the community in general would benefit from finding more adjectives than “clunky.”) It is necessary to use numbers if you want to claim your DPS or survivability aren’t competitive, because otherwise you’re just guessing.<br />
<br />
We put literally freak, freaking HOURS into trying to help him and his team out for no benefit with only the intent of making their awful, low depth designs work better and he disregards it? Forget that, I'm going to play Tera. At least THEIR idea of AM is actually engaging.<br />
You're going to get disappointed a lot if you're hoping to see developers incorporate your ideas. That’s just no a realistic goal with a player base the size of ours. The reason I took the time to try and address some of the feedback in this thread is to make sure players understand our design intent. The players out there who are trying to turn “active mitigation” into “I have a ton of cooldowns that don’t cost resources” are working at cross purposes with the class designers. It’s not an invalid design by any stretch, but we also feel it’s essentially the design we had in Cataclysm where tanks would spend all of their resources on threat that was all just overkill. Spending resources on defense gets more to the heart of tanking and we think will be more enjoyable in the long run. In the short run it may feel different and weird.<br />
<br />
The players posting on this forum do not represent the majority of the warrior population and are practically meaningless to you ('the vocal minority').<br />
The players who post are ALWAYS a minority. By far, most of our players don't post. Some of the most skilled and informed players out there don't post. Does the posting community represent the feelings of the majority? It’s hard to know for sure. That’s why we pay more attention to intelligent argument than we do to any kind of invocation of how &quot;most players&quot; feel. We do read all of the feedback though. We’re not always going to act on all of it. That’s just the reality of game design. We don’t want WoW to be designed by committee, and you probably don’t want us to either. <br />
<br />
There are still other issues not addressed regarding our rotation...<br />
Execute is a great button, but it’s not available much of the time. Slam and Wild Strike are better than Heroic Strike. You should always go to them first. If you have so much rage than even several Slams in a row will leave you with excess rage, then you break out the Heroic Strikes as well, since you can Heroic Strike AND Slam in the same GCD. You’ll have to make the call about buttons like Overpower depending on the situation. Overpower won’t help you with rage management if it’s time to Slam, but on the other hand, Overpower is free, and the ultimate goal is to do deliver as much damage as possible. Managing rage isn’t the goal itself; it’s just a strategy to deliver the damage.<br />
<br />
The Protection warrior was fun, required rage management and had active mitigation.<br />
There is no active mitigation on live. You can define active mitigation your own way if you’d like, but using our definition, active mitigation is mitigation costing resources. On live, all mitigation is cooldown-driven for warriors, druids and paladins. Resources are for gaining threat (which isn't that hard to generate) or delivering DPS (which usually isn’t very valuable for tanks except on very tightly tuned fights).<br />
<br />
Alright, you don't want suggestions on how to fix the many, many problems?<br />
Suggestions are fine and often useful. We are seeing some players brainstorming new abilities or resource systems, which aren’t as valuable to us, and can actually be a little risky to the process when players can get overly attached to their own ideas and end up disappointed or bitter when we don't use them.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it would help to increase the rage cap to 200, so Shield Block would only be a third of our red bar, and warriors can pool enough rage for 2 or 3 Shield Blocks. Or make the first Shield Block less expensive, and later ones more expensive (like Arcane Blast).<br />
I don’t think we’d increase rage to 200, but we could get the same effect by making Shield Block cheaper. The reason we haven’t yet is we were concerned it might lead to feeling like you can realistically have 100% Shield Block coverage. Once you can afford to push Shield Block constantly, then it feels like it’s a maintenance buff (more like Thunder Clap) and not a button with any kind of timing component. It might be worth trying just flooding Protection with rage to see how it feels. Likewise, we could see how much rage it takes before Arms and Fury are using Heroic Strike constantly instead of situationally. Also remember that warriors will get more rage with better gear -- we still want that to occur because it feels fun, so long as it doesn't become a big scaling problem (meaning warriors are weak with bad gear and unstoppable with good gear, which has often been a problem in WoW).<br />
<br />
Can warriors get an offensive benefit to strength, much like agi and int gives to the other classes? Defensive benefits do literally nothing for me, considering how negligible they are. It's been a long standing issue of mine that warriors get Parry, while Agi users get crit, and int users get crit and spell power bonuses. <br />
We balance around the stats you have. If warriors received crit from Strength, then we’d have to lower the damage of your abilities as a consequence. We don’t like Strength providing crit, because then it just feels like Agility. There are potential scaling risks if Agi users do more damage as they get more Agi than Strength users do as they get more Strength. With warriors though we usually have the opposite problem because they do so much more damage as they get better weapons (as well as more rage from better gear as well).

<br />
Spell Reflect - Why Was It Nerfed?<br />
Spell Reflect is one of those mechanics that always feels weak to the warrior and overpowered to everyone else. We ran a bunch of internal BGs and Arenas and it was pretty universal that the casters were constantly having everything reflected if there was a warrior in the area.<br />
<br />
We're still tweaking the Mass Spell Reflect talent. We want it to feel awesome, and we think that is a good way for warriors who want to be great at reflection to be able to make that commitment. Our current thought is that Mass Spell Reflect is a new ability (meaning that you'd have both spell reflects) and doesn't require a shield. We like that seeing the warrior strap on a shield signals to the caster that reflection is a risk -- the alternative is that sometimes your spells just bounce back at you, seemingly at random. That logic works for the core Spell Reflect, but already doesn't work with Mass, because you don't see the shield for the warrior's allies. Decoupling the two spells also lets us individually tweak their durations and cooldowns.

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
Hard drive prices have started to decline, but are still well above the pre-flood prices, so now is still a good time to buy a SSD, as the next generation is a while away and the current prices have started moving downward again (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/february/ssdgraph.gif), with sales bringing the cost to under $1 per gigabyte. <br />
<br />
New Ivy Bridge CPUs from Intel are here, and aren't as interesting as we would have hoped. They do run faster, use less power, have more powerful GPUs, but can't disperse heat as fast as Sandy Bridge. If you are building today and don't go for the upper range of overclocking (past ~4.5Ghz) then you are better off buying Ivy Bridge. If you want to go for the maximum overclocks or have to save money, the 2500k (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EBUXHQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004EBUXHQ) is $30-40 cheaper.<br />
<br />
Nvidia has released the GTX 680 and GTX 690, which are currently the best top end choices. A fairly reliable review of a GTX 670 popped up this weekend, showing it as being faster than a 7970. It may be a factory overclocked card, as the performance is close to a GTX 680. <br />
<br />
If you are buying a GPU that costs $400 or more and aren't in a hurry, you may want to hold off until the rumored release date of late this week or early next week to see more official reviews and any price drops by AMD. There really aren't any good choices faster than the 7850, unless you can find the GTX 680 in stock. If you are buying at the ~$300 level right now, take a look at the 7850 in the list, as they are overclocking (http://forums.overclockers.co.uk/showthread.php?t=18389760&amp;page=1#11) to GTX 580 performance with almost every card. <br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

Ibuypower/cyberpower are decent bang for the buck, provided you pick the correct parts and understand you get the customer service that you pay for.<br />

Isn't building your own computer generally the cheaper option, though?</div></div><hr />

I don't build my own computer, I much rather have a factory do it for me, and spend my time actually using it instead.<br />
<br />
Just my take.<br />
<br />
Buying a premade branded PC (e.g. Dell, Alienware, HP (disclaimer - other brands are available)) means you are paying for advertising and customer service on top of the components, and thus they use cheap, generic components. They're OK for the family PC if all you want to do is browse the internet and play minesweeper, but any serious gamer wouldn't dream of buying one.<br />
<br />
It's actually significantly cheaper to build your own and you'll end up with a much higher spec PC. Most suppliers will sell you bundles of motherboard, CPU (overclocked, thus adding even more value), cooler and RAM, pre-assembled for a small fee.<br />
<br />
Future upgrades can become even cheaper too because if you want to you can reuse the case, PSU, DVD and HDDs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Isn't building your own computer generally the cheaper option, though?<br />
<br />
Yes, it is. See above.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, see this list (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/986175-Marest-s-Sample-Builds) for an idea of what you can get for cheap prices!</div></div><hr />

<br />
What a lame reason for quitting. The main reason there is more cloth without spirit is that spirit is of zero use to mages and warlocks, and cloth with spirit is only of use to priests. There is lots of mail without spirit too. I don't see the problem. You can always reforge. QED.</div></div><hr />

That was my first thought... what's the point of a mount that walks on water, when all your other mounts can do that with a water walking potion? If you can't fish from it it's not that special, imo.</div></div><hr />

I recently built a new gaming rig - i5 2500k, gigzbyte z68 mobo (it's pretty cheap and shit actually, I don't like it) 8gig DDR3 (high rate but I can't remember what off the top of my head), GeForce 680 GTX, 2TB HDD (no ssd), 750w corsair enthusiast PSU, proper case with 3 fans and a nice airflow, cheap aftermarket cooler for the CPU and some other things...<br />
<br />
Cost me £900 where as I was looking at similar pre built PCs and they were around £400 more in some cases. I'm not working that out in dollars but the point is it was nearly 50% more to have it pre built from some sources. I admit they were the more expensive ones I found and I put mine together with the best prices I could find on the net but it illustrates perfectly the point how much cheaper it is to do it yourself. I spent nearly half of my budget just on the graphics card as well when it had just came out and there were no deals on it.<br />
<br />
Ohh and the other good thing about taking the time to learn how to do it is my CPU is running at a steady 4.5ghz (from 3.3 stock) at 40c =] So you get a better bang for your buck as well!</div></div><hr />

The main reason there is more cloth without spirit is that spirit is of zero use to mages and warlocks, and cloth with spirit is only of use to priests. There is lots of mail without spirit too. I don't see the problem. You can always reforge. QED.<br />
<br />
Did you see the loot tables in 4.2? Comapre them to any other healing class in this game. Spirit no use to other cloth users? How is this anything other than poor design? As for reforging.....If Blizzard really wanted to throttle spirit this reduction would be across the board - truth is they just cba to make big enough raids anymore. So perhaps you can tell me why I should pay the same sub fee as a H Pally?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why did you pick a HX 750 when it's made by CWT and not Seasonic? That's the whole thing buying Corsairs products, &quot;the quality&quot;. CWT lack of quality, and you're picking a HX750 instead of a HX650 which is build by Seasonic? If you want a 750W PSU you should atleast have picked the AX one.. GZ chaud<br />
<br />
This is a build where you get most out of the money.<br />

Just my take.<br />
<br />
Dude, building a computer is not complicated. Building a car, growing corn, and programming is. <br />
For a few hours of your time following a simple and concise walk through you can get a state of the art computer that will last you 5 years with minimal upgrades easily for a fraction of what a premade computer will cost you. <br />
I couldn't even tell you the difference between ram and hard drive space when I started letting a friend help me build my rigs. <br />
Since 2004 I've only had 2 computers built, and they both ran state of the art games for years with only a few graphics card updates.</div></div><hr />

Not every single piece of gear needs to have spirit, that's the main point Blizzard wants to get across. Let's keep 4.2 as an example, as a Holy Paladin the only belt available for that tier of content was the reputation one, and it was a crit/mastery belt. No spirit, and there's absolutely nobody else that could have used it. Like it was mentioned in the blue post, you reach certain points where you can have plenty of mana regeneration even with a few spirit-less pieces. I agree that it's poor design, but it's certainly not exclusive to cloth users.</div></div><hr />

Nope. The best you could do is a Phenom II X4 980. Depending on what you have now, I would just wait for Haswell in 2013 and upgrade the CPU/mobo/RAM then if you can.<br />

More expensive than a retail machine? That's pretty crap. Not sure where you live, but here in Australia retail computers are insanely overpriced. I made the mistake of buying one. Spent almost 3k on a computer that lasted me a year before I realised it was crap. Got my friend to build me an awesome computer and cost me a little under 2k, it's lasted me longer than the retail one and cost less.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, in addition to tier and valor there were at least 6 ot 7 extra H pally drops containing spirit in 4.2 - for a priest there were zero and only 1 in 4.3. If Blizzard are so sure that mana regen gets too much why only limit cloth? What would happen for example if through bad luck all that was available were non spirit drops for the first few weeks? There is infact no problem providing they produce big enough raids, but those days seem to have gone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's Beta. They tend to make more 'mature' jokes and references in Beta, then change them in live.<br />
<br />
A prime example is one of those Sullah's Sideshow quests in Uldum. On live, you have a quest called &quot;Master Trapper&quot;, with this text:<br />
<br />
<br />
One thing about me that you might not know, ...<br />
<br />
I come from a long line of trappers. My father taught me, as his taught him, to master the art of trapping creatures in a most merciful manner.<br />
<br />
As any master trapper will tell you, the most important ingredient in an effective trap is the bait.<br />
<br />
So let's start there.<br />
<br />
Fill this bucket with the meat scraps from almost any wild creature in Uldum. <br />
<br />
In the Cataclysm Beta, it was &quot;Bait Master&quot;, with this text:<br />
<br />
<br />
One thing about me that you might not know, &lt;name&gt;... <br />
<br />
I come from a long line of bait masters. My father taught me, as his taught him, to master the art of baiting. <br />
<br />
Come, now, I'll show you what I mean. &lt;Sullah raises an eyebrow at you.&gt; Why the hesitation, my friend? No need to be shy! <br />
<br />
&lt;Sullah shrugs.&gt; Very well, we'll start slow. I have a bucket here that I want you to fill... with bait. Meat scraps from any of Uldum's wildlife will do just fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR: It won't be called this on Live, I'm sure. Though I'm still surprised the whole &quot;Thrall's Balls&quot; line got through.<br />
<br />
<br />
It looks like there will be a fair number of fishing dailies. I wonder if they'll give skill-ups for fishing, or if they are just progression?<br />
<br />
I could probably check by clicking on them, but I don't wanna spoil any quest specifics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the original, he proudly proclaimed to, essentially, be a master baiter. He talked about how his father taught him, and how his father taught him, to be a master baiter. He then offers to show the player what he means, then asks them to fill up a bucket.<br />
<br />
In live it was changed to &quot;master trapper&quot; and a few of the euphemisms were changed to be less overt and obvious. <br />
<br />
There was also a Titan statue in the Wrath Beta that was doing the devil horns with one hand, but it was changed to a salute for live. While that one isn't so...I'm hesitant to say 'offensive', it just didn't fit in with Warcraft, and it shows that the Beta tends to be a little less serious in places than when things go live.</div></div><hr />

Parts have warranties, too. I only had to use it once in the 15 years that I build my own computers, when a videocard broke down before it's time. I got a replacement, no problem.<br />

Ah yes, PCs obviously only fit in basements, not in ordinary homes. It's not like the majority of people with a PC actually have a PC and not a laptop. When I go out, I tend to socialize, not take my laptop with me to play games/surf MMO-Champion.<br />

I'll set aside the fact that it gives me the willies. (It looks like an creepy, evil doll that may or may not become possessed and kill me in my sleep or something. And those eyes! And that mouth! *shudder*) It doesn't look like it comes from the same species as the adult Pandaren. It has a completely different head and neck shape than the adult. The ears sit in a different spot on the head. And its hands are all funky. It almost looks like they aren't even there.<br />
<br />
I so agree! The model seems completely out of place and I hope they replace it before the release. I'd rather see a chubby mini Pandaren, that indeed looks like a doll from a scary movie. To me, it looks like it was made in a hurry.</div></div><hr />

Parts have warranties, too. I only had to use it once in the 15 years that I build my own computers, when a videocard broke down before it's time. I got a replacement, no problem.<br />

Ah yes, PCs obviously only fit in basements, not in ordinary homes. It's not like the majority of people with a PC actually have a PC and not a laptop. When I go out, I tend to socialize, not take my laptop with me to play games/surf MMO-Champion.<br />

<br />
Normal computers you can buy run games fine and have a warranty. Plus Since I'm a student and not the kinda person who locks themselves in a dark basement a PC does not fit me. Laptops aren't easily built and if not taken extreme care do have a habit of needing to use their warranty.<br />
<br />
I don't need to win/play games so much that I need to go out of my way with such a useless endeavor.<br />
<br />
It's not a useless endeavor at all. I am a student as well, and have a laptop, and you certainly should not assemble those yourself, you're right (apart from the RAM and hdd/ssd maybe).<br />
<br />
But telling people building their own computer from parts was useless is utter, and excuse my language but it needs to be put concretely, bullshit.<br />
You get a much more powerful PC with the parts and software you want and need for a lower price, the assembly is fairly easy (my sister did it after watching a video, previous knowledge was that she could barely name the parts... need I say more?), and your argument about the warranty is of course invalid, as the individual parts have their own warranty. <br />
<br />
If you don't want to get out of your way, feel very free not to do so. But please stop spreading wrong information.</div></div><hr />

Everything that needs to be said has been said. Building your own is easy, given minimal effort. It is by far cheaper. You don't get preinstalled BS with your initial setup. You give yourself the ability to upgrade later and to upgrade easier (many brand names have custom parts or lack slots/power for upgrade).<br />
<br />
The downside is that if you're a mouth breathing idiot who can barely function in society using common sense, that you won't be able to take your box back to best buy to get ass reamed by geek squad who will just wipe your entire hard drive, charge you $150, all the while likely stealing any personal info you had in the process, because hey, you just entrusted your PC to a 17 year kid making $8/hr.<br />
<br />

Aren't those supposed to use the new Ivy Bridge (warms up a lot compared to Sandy Bridge when you increase Vcore values)<br />
<br />
<br />
why dont you never put amd on narwhal and unicorn? their setup is always with intel cpu <br />
I bought an AM3 motherboard and AMD cpu last year because they were really great at Wattage / Performance -&gt; Temperature.<br />
Then I learned that AMD is ages behind Intel especially comparing any processor to the Intel 2700k+<br />
AMD is stuck with 45nm chips while Intel uses 32nm chips since a lot of time.<br />
The New AMD &quot;Buldozzer&quot; is using a 32nm chip, but guess what ? <br />
Their quad, hexa and 8cores processors are just dual, tri and quad cores with a tecnology similar to Intel's Hyper Threading.<br />
You pay them less because they are giving you less.<br />
A hexa-core 4Ghz &quot;buldozzer&quot; still perform worst and an Intel 2700k (quad core) in every kind of Benchmark because it's not a real six core.<br />
Even the PhenomII x4 960T linked in the puppy build performs better than the new &quot;Buldozzer&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now... knowing that a puppy processor is better than the AMD' last born...do you get why AMD processors are never linked in top end gaming builds? Because their CPUs suck at gaming and are good only to work on excell's spreadsheets :S<br />
<br />
<br />
Do yourself a favor, never ever buy an AMD processor /motherboard. Spend something more on an Intel processor / motherbord.<br />
Or if you are on a budget, take a very good motherboard and sacrifice the processor a bit, because any Intel processor will be better than the newest AMD's</div></div><hr />

secoundly building a computer is not hard it is kinda easy mans lego and as long as you watch A guide beforehand you totally know what to do and in the end you will save alot of cash and have a machine you know what you can uppgrade and should uppgrade later on. witch means alot less digging.

Even with the i7 3770k (overclocked to 4.5ghz), a GTX 560ti, SSD, 7200rpm HDD, an extra PCI slot, 4 fans, and two ipods charging via USB, you only need 441watts...<br />
<br />
Yet you recommend a 750w power supply for that unicorn build? What a joke.<br />
<br />
I HIGHLY suggest getting this power supply for any of the above mentioned builds:<br />
http://www.amazon.com/Antec-BP550-Plus-ATX12V-Modular/dp/B0017KE3DM/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336423689&amp;sr=1-1<br />
<br />
It's modular, very affordable, and more than sufficient until you go SLI or use multiple physical CPUs (neither of which are recommended unless you are at top-of-the-line technology already).<br />
<br />
Also as personal preference I recommend the MSI motherboards for their new BIOS and the driver update utility which actually works well. I would highly suggest you do NOT buy the gigabyte motherboard. I've had terrible experience with gigabyte motherboards causing BSODs, even when replacing all other hardware. They may have fixed the issue now, but I will never trust them again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason to go with 750W is for clean power. <br />
<br />
Utilizing a PS above 80% can cause issues. These issues would be heat related, relating to the cleanliness of the signal and the longevity of the PS itself. <br />
<br />
Moreover, at 441, you're at over 75% which means you're effectively maxed on a PS if you go with a 550W PS. <br />
<br />
One of the major points of enjoyment of having a BYOB is being able to add pieces as one sees fit. If someone finds the funds, chooses to go SLI or a company brings a high current new graphic technology to market, the BYOB gamer has the option to swap pieces and enjoy it. <br />
<br />
I do agree that gamers need to smartly search for Power Supplies that meet their needs. That said, I hardly think &quot;these PC builds are retarded&quot; because they allow for additional power overhead.</div></div><hr />

You jumped to so many conclusions and insults you are not worth trying to fight since you can't see any reason to comment other then to insult people directly.

You made the exact same stupid conclusions and personally directed them so you have not furthered your case. &quot;Proven wrong by several people&quot; you couldn't even read the post i reponed to to realize you make the same conclusions, how can I expect you to know that I have been &quot;proven&quot; wrong?<br />
<br />
Have theses people who proven me wrong went in a one-on-one head on competion of computers with mine? Have they proven that they are world class interesting outdoors people who don't soup up computers for no other reasons then to say they have increased things by a useless amount of fps? I know MY store bought laptop can run almost every game I find on high, and I havn't been shown that all these souped up computers are different (no one on this thread has been shown that)<br />
<br />
If I hit on some sort of personal nerve to you two I guess I'm sorry but you should really get over it and realize computers are great when not built and that the set-ups of the month on these websites are useless and in my opinion boring nonsense of useless endeavors.</div></div><hr />

Better to go with the Gigabyte HD7850, you get it overclocked and it's cheaper, even with out the option of voltage tweaking, it works out better/cheaper.<br />

I don't build my own car, I don't grow my own corn, I don't program my own computer games. <br />
I don't build my own computer, I much rather have a factory do it for me, and spend my time actually using it instead.<br />
<br />
Just my take.<br />
<br />
Cheaper to buy the parts and just pay for labour or do it yourself tbh. I work in a PC shop, we make double if not triple the cost price when we make PCs</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jmickey</div><div class="date">2012-05-09, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently built a computer around the same area as the Unicorn build, and tbh I think the posted build could have done with some more research. There is really no need for a WD Black drive over a Blue or a Seagate Barracuda, they produce too much heat and noise and the speed isn't really noticeable. I actually have one in my computer atm from my old machine and it benchmarks at the same level as my Samsung Spinpoint F1 which is older. <br />
<br />
The OCZ Vertex 3 drive recommendation is one I would personally be taking down asap, these are knows to have dodgy Sandforce controllers and can be rather unstable. The Intel 520 series drive is amazing, and if people really need a second recommendation they should be looking at a Crucial M4, which are praised on every computer internet forum I know.<br />
<br />
The PSU from the Narwhal build should be the one recommended for the Unicorn build instead, 750W for that system just isn't required unless the person is going to be going SLI or Crossfire some time soon. Lastly, the CPU cooler mentioned is the same one I have in my current system, and while I agree it's an amazing cooler, unless you're overclock past 4.5Ghz there really isn't any need for it, a CM Evo 212 would be a much more suitable cooler for this build.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that these are my opinions, the reason I am actually voicing them is because they are backed up quite strongly be hundreds of thousands of users all over the internet. Essentially there is nothing wrong with the builds, but there are a lot of people that will possibly build a PC on this recommendation, so I see it as important that they are building the best one possible for their dollar. Maybe some more research in the future, there is a reason that certain components are popular in hardware enthusiasts world, http://overclock.net would probably be a good place to start, also the Desktop forum over at http://forums.whirlpool.net.au.</div></div><hr />

The warranty you get for Each of the parts is much longer (in some cases lifetime) than the one you get from a ready-to-ship pc. <br />
<br />
It should be replaced by: I hate clipping the fan on the cpu cooler.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arrowhead</div><div class="date">2012-05-09, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those are nice, but I recently upgraded my computer from the following:<br />
<br />
I had:<br />
<br />
M4A79T-Deluxe<br />
AMD Phenom II 965 x4 3.4ghz black edition<br />
8 GB Mushkin Enhanced Blackline 1333 mhz (overclocked to 1600)<br />
CM Storm Scout Case<br />
PSU Antec 750w power supply<br />
Logitech G500 Mouse<br />
Logitech G15 Keyboard<br />
Logitech X-540 5.1 Sound System<br />
Logitech G330 Headset<br />
Acer H243H 24&quot; Monitor with speakers<br />
Razer Destructer Mouse Pad<br />
ATI Radeon HD 6950 2 GB Video Card<br />
<br />
I upgraded for $1200 to:<br />
<br />
ASUS Sabertooth 990FX AM3+ AMD 990FX SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX AMD Motherboard with UEFI BIOS<br />
AMD FX-8120 Zambezi 3.1GHz Socket AM3+ 125W Eight-Core (overclocked to 3.6 ghz and soon to 4.0 Ghz when i get liquid cooling)<br />
Mushkin Enhanced Blackline 32GB (4 x 8GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1600 <br />
XION AXP-850K14XE 850W ATX SLI Ready CrossFire Ready 80+ Bronze Modular Power Supply<br />
COOLER MASTER CM Storm Series Trooper (SGC-5000-KKN1) Black Steel / Plastic ATX Full Tower Computer Case<br />
Acer S271HLbid Black 27&quot; 5ms HDMI Widescreen LED Monitor<br />
<br />
My new system is looking pretty stable so far, even though I had trouble flashing my BIOS on the sabertooth (apparently I am not the only one, according to different tech forums). Memory is stable, and I am very impressed with Mushkin's Blackline. The Storm Series Trooper has excellent airflow, and overnight my CPU temps got as low as 15C. Playing BF3 on max graphics and Tera Online with max graphics only put me to 58C. Very impressed so far. <br />
<br />
I don't think its worth it to go to a SSD unless you have more than 700GB out of 1 TB on the hard-drive that you have windows installed on to. I have never had problems with my 2 1 TB WD Green Caviar drives, and everything loads superb. I guess for those who are willing to spend an extra 4-800 dollars for only 200-500GB SSD's, you are certainly welcome to. <br />
<br />
It really doesn't cost that much to upgrade to the latest and best. I would have gone for the ASUS Crosshair V, but I was not a fan of how it was set up, and the sabertooth looked more effeciently built (plus I really like the UEFI BIOS)<br />
