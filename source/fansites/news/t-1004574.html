Blizzcon 2011 - Live Raid ... Live!<br />
It seems that this year's live raid is also available through conventional streaming by other players in the raid! vodka (http://www.vodka-guild.net) and Blood Legion (http://bloodlegion.com/wow/) will try to survive whatever Gamemasters decide to throw at them! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a competition between vodka and Blood Legion.<br />
This is a modified version of Firelands with no trash, the first guild to take down Ragnaros wins. <br />
The feed below is from Blood Legion, for a stream of both guilds with a nice tracking of the progression you will have to head to the official blizzcon live stream (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/live-stream/)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Live Raid is over, congratulations to Blood Legion for killing Ragnaros first!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure they only act like this when they want to be NUMBER ONE etc. On farms they are most likely relaxed.<br />
This is competition between vodka and them so they stress about no mistakes, fast fast fast etc.<br />
They want to win. Thats their nature, thats why they are at the progress they are in.<br />
Plus the fact that THOUSANDS of people are watching this. almost 3k in the livestream + blizzcon stream + blizzcon itself = stress? You would have it too<br />
<br />
But yeah. So much stress and cursing. Each to their own I guess</div></div><hr />

Yeah, talk about making an ass out of himself/them. Dunno about how vodka is in this raid but usually they are pretty calm and laidback.<br />

<br />
Those masks that sell a stack of 5 for 5 Tricky Treats? The ones that AREN'T the 12 player races? They have stat buffs. Murlocs = Agility, Ogres = Stamina, Vrykul = Strength, and Naga = Intellect.</div></div><hr />

Hearing blood leigions vent for a few minutes make me think they are kids high on energy drinks stressing out over content I thought they had on farm and cleared week after week. They should know this stuff by now instead if they call themsevles top guilds in wow.<br />
And swearing on vent on a Livestream is not a good outlook, especially oin blizzards behalf.</div></div><hr />

They kept screaming and cursing and it was just not enjoyable at all. I wasn't an idiot and I knew what I was doing and my dps was just fine, but it didn't seem to matter. This Blood Legion stream is very similar. Why would you want to run with such an asshole guild leader? Lord. It's just a game. Calm the hell down. lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Forgottenone</div><div class="date">2011-10-22, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that they are acting how they are because they are actually in a race against another guild who is right on their ass, not only that but they are both being watched live right now. From what I saw (I am watching both) the RL of BL doesn't want his raiders to get distracted by Vodka, he wants them to focus on Ragnaros and focus on their job hence the reason he is telling them to shut up. It is easier and faster to just be loud and dominant vs. being calm and passive, I highly doubt they are like this during world first races since, well although they are racing they aren't within 5-10% health of another guild.</div></div><hr />

They are suppose to represent the best of the best, at the professional level. What I just experienced once a gain are a bunch of kids crying like babies. Sure things do not go as planned but the obscene abuse at each other is uncalled for.<br />
You use Usain Bolt as an example, when you say hes done it plenty of times.<br />
Should it have been the same for these guilds, race or not?<br />
Isn't that what blood leigion should of been like as well? &quot; we done this so many times it should be a breeze&quot;</div></div><hr />

If your offended by the word fuck, you might want to find a new hobby. The RL of Blood Legion is tasked with trying to hold his raid together and down a boss in front of 50k people (livestream + attendees) all before the guild sitting next to him does. If thats not nerve racking tell me what is. There would be no more efficient way for him to tell his raid to stop talking than &quot;SHUT THE FUCK UP&quot;. Asking them to simply be quiet isn't how he became the raid leader of a Top 3 US Guild and Top 15 worldwide. His language and volume was absolutely necessary to accomplish what they just did. Obviously his raid group does not mind his yelling and it makes them a better team. If he yells at them and calls them the n word and fags its because he wants them to succeed not because he is racist or discriminatory. Get over it, its just a word.</div></div><hr />

You're right! We aren't in the dark ages. Using the N word and the word &quot;fag&quot; doesn't make you a homophobe OR racist. <br />

Anyway, I'd like make a point here in saying that the language used on BL's vent is something that is quite common, and even expected in high-end raiding guilds (which is, in my opinion unfortunate, but if hardcore raiding is something you want to do, you've gotta be able to deal with it). In some cases that I have personally encountered, their language could be considered quite tame if you can imagine that!

There are plenty of profane words available to you that aren't perpetuating hate speech. Try showing that you're adults and actually using some of those instead of just slinging around ableist, homophobic, and racist slurs because you're lazy or too immature to have your world view challenged. God forbid you show some common human decency. No, it's cool though, &quot;We're gamers&quot;. Thanks for making us all look bad. This is very disappointing to see in a top guild. I would have thought we'd come farther than that. I wish I hadn't watched. I didn't catch the initial slurs you used, but left my stream going so abruptly got confronted by someone complaining about the fact people were expressing shock and disappointment in your choice of language, and you calling us &quot;retards&quot; for not getting that it's &quot;gamer language&quot;. This is pretty disgusting. It doesn't HAVE to be &quot;because we're gamers, we talk this way&quot;. There's no reason at all that gamers are expected to talk like middle-schoolers.

The words have become more generic insults than racial slurs or homophobic slurs and they must be seen in that context. We do not know if any of his guild members are African American or homosexual but we can assume not if he openly calls them these words. Your taking these words out of context from their meanings 40 years or 20 years ago. Words change.

I don't recall saying or implying that it was shown at Blizzcon. It was shown on this website, and I'm sure many people watched and listened. Regardless of the audience, using racial and other slurs shows a lack of class. As for the people who will argue that it was high-pressure and he had to say such things to keep people in line...how does the N word and the F (not f*ck) word help that at all? It doesn't. It does, however, show colors. A person so willing to say those kinds of things to his raiders, well, it shows what kind of person he is, in my opinion. For the record, I am not against swearing. Racial and other slurs though, makes me think of BL as trashy. Kudos to their raid leader for that, it makes me sad.</div></div><hr />

You use Usain Bolt as an example, when you say hes done it plenty of times.<br />
Should it have been the same for these guilds, race or not?<br />
Isn't that what blood leigion should of been like as well? &quot; we done this so many times it should be a breeze&quot;<br />
<br />
What I meant with Bolt is that he is still extremely happy when he wins a race and he has done that tons of times. For these guys it's one of the first times they have even raced.<br />

It's not about clearing the instance, it's about the race. and that they had actually never done before I guess.</div></div><hr />

They're just words! Grow up<br />

If they're &quot;just words&quot;, why is it so hard to use words that aren't loaded and subjugate entire subcultures/races/etc of people? <br />

And hey, loaded words are loaded, and your intent for them not to be offensive does not magically remove the fact that people will be offended because you are saying, whether you &quot;mean&quot; to or not, that being gay or black, or disabled is an insult. <br />

I am so sick of ignorant people waving their asses around trying to argue their &quot;right&quot; to use hate speech. Yes, it's your &quot;right&quot; to say it.

If your offended by the word fuck, you might want to find a new hobby. The RL of Blood Legion is tasked with trying to hold his raid together and down a boss in front of 50k people (livestream + attendees) all before the guild sitting next to him does. If thats not nerve racking tell me what is. There would be no more efficient way for him to tell his raid to stop talking than &quot;SHUT THE FUCK UP&quot;. Asking them to simply be quiet isn't how he became the raid leader of a Top 3 US Guild and Top 15 worldwide. His language and volume was absolutely necessary to accomplish what they just did. Obviously his raid group does not mind his yelling and it makes them a better team. If he yells at them and calls them the n word and fags its because he wants them to succeed not because he is racist or discriminatory. Get over it, its just a word.<br />
<br />
Absolutely nothing you have just spouted at everyone here makes a lick of sense accept for the clear message of support for bad sportsmanship and defending of racist remarks, no it's not just a word as you say, it has a negative meaning and the person who used it clearly showed his true colors and child like behavior.<br />
<br />
Top raiders or not, clearly people don't give a shit... if someone wants to act like they just had their lollies swiped from their sticky fingers, then they can expect to get negative comments and condemnation, act like a baby get treated like a baby.<br />
<br />
May I suggest you look at both sides of the argument before trying to talk down to everyone, sure there's the pressure to perform, but that's no excuse.</div></div><hr />

I cannot BELIEVE all of the posts in this thread complaining/ stressing about the language involved during these raids. Are you their mommies? Grow up and ignore it. Words are words are words and nothing more, seriously, if you want to complain about language all day go teach middle school or something.</div></div><hr />

They work together as a team and even when one makes a screw up they try and encourage the player by patting them on the shoulder and letting them know it happens. So people who say that BL wasn't very professional and then people say well it's a lot of stress so they have the right to freak out...I guess I find it hard to believe. 50k people is nothing compared to watching an olympian that has the whole world watching them struggle to come in first but has a better attitude about it win or lose. Competition is competition...and sportsmanship is sportsmanship. BL was lacking of that today and it does matter. Only because it makes some of the more humble top raiding guilds look like jerks because these other guilds want to go and act like that. People see one top guild act like a bunch of jerks they assume ALL top guilds are like that when it's not the case. But maybe that's just how I see things. If I'm entitled to my opinion everyone else is entitled to theirs. I just think that if I were the guild leader I would want my guild to be show cased as respectable people who can still get the job done without acting like drama queens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nor is it how I would want mine, but in an intense situation like the one we witnessed. They are more concerned of the notoriety of being the best guild in the US than the image of their RL. I have gay friends, many in fact who play WoW, I have black friends, many who also play WoW. They call me a faggot and a nigger and I do the same if the time is appropriate. Nobody is offended, this whole thread has become people tied up on words, its not like he is throwing rocks at blacks and gays.

From what I saw (I am watching both) the RL of BL doesn't want his raiders to get distracted by Vodka, he wants them to focus on Ragnaros and focus on their job hence the reason he is telling them to shut up. It is easier and faster to just be loud and dominant vs. being calm and passive, I highly doubt they are like this during world first races since, well although they are racing they aren't within 5-10% health of another guild.<br />
<br />
Rigg yells like that even during their first kills. Watch their first kill of heroic Rag and you'll hear him fussing like he did in the stream.</div></div><hr />

Your obviously entitled to your opinion but I dont really think they gave themselves a bad image for using a few racial slurs. I mean in a month if we were to talk about Blizzcon 2011 we will remember that Blood Legion beat Vodka in a really intense fight, not that BL was a bit racist during Rag. I mean in your guild vent or however you communicate to friends while gaming you've probably heard someone call another player a faggot or a nigger, but do you really see them any different afterwards? No, thats my point I dont think BL has lost anything here.</div></div><hr />

Really?<br />
<br />
I was watching cricket, India vs England, the other day, and one of the bowlers (think pitchers, if you're US) chewed out one of his fielders for being slow at returning the ball, which allowed the opposition an extra run. What was up with that? It's only a game, isn't it?</div></div><hr />

Classy of you to acknowledge that it wasn't really appropriate for a general audience.<br />
<br />
Personally, I am totally cool with 'Shut the fuck up!' from my raid leader, but racial and sexual orientation slurs disturb me. I totally get that there are people on both sides of the spectrum from me though; people that would be offended by 'fuck' and people who can call each other faggots over vent and think nothing of it. <br />
<br />
On the whole, I think it did reflect poorly on BL, but that's how people talk. It's nothing about being good, terrible players can come up with offensive things as well as anyone in a top guild.<br />

Based on the last sentence in your first paragraph, I'm not sure you really get it, Nodzz. <br />
<br />
I doubt most people are that upset for having to hear &quot;bad language&quot;. They are just unimpressed by your guild's use of racial slurs, general lack of awareness of how public this stream would be, and the guild's interpersonal atmosphere in general. <br />
<br />
Folks are passing a reasonable judgement on the kinds of people you have in your guild. If that's the kind of folks you are, then there's no reason to apologize. Just realize that your style of communication does not resonate with many people, and that it could possibly result in your guild not being invited back to raid at Blizzcon in the future.</div></div><hr />

I thought it was pretty funny. The raid leader was doing his job, motivating ppl and not die to stupid shit. Look at vodka they were pretty passive and wasnt vocal enough and ppl made stupid mistakes, even if they farm it for months it doesnt matter. BL won cause they had a better raid leader. And for those who disagree.......i dunno....lol?</div></div><hr />

Kobe Bryant called a ref a &quot;fucking faggot&quot; on live television. He's one of the most cultured athletes on the planet. No one would accuse him of homophobia. His emotions got the better of him in a tense situation.<br />

He apologized. Everyone moved on. The lasting lesson from the dustup was that you probably shouldn't put a camera on someone who's in the heat of the moment. There's a reason they don't have a mic on players in the NBA or the NFL.</div></div><hr />

And I don't think BL has a better raid leader, or they'd be the #1 US guild outright and not Vodka. Shouting out homophobic and racial slurs out of excitement is a pretty bad explanation. If you're shouting the N word out of excitement, your a racist, if you're shouting fag out of excitement, you're homophobic. There's no denying it, it's just fact. If I was BL, I wouldn't apologize or say anything in response. You're like a kid that gets caught stealing, you're sorry you got caught, not because you offended someone. Next year they should just show Paragon vs. Method, so they can show you what class looks like.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps it would have been better for us to leave the mumble off, but I'm also glad we were able to give people who were interested an opportunity to see what raiding is like from our perspective. The concerns about certain language are legitimate though and I'm sorry you had to hear that.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way though, I don't know why anyone is complaining about how Rigg led us. He did exactly what we needed him to do, and I appreciate him telling us to shut up when mumble is getting too loud. If you wouldn't want to raid here, I can completely understand that, but this works for us.</div></div><hr />

Now, do I think they are racist/homophobic? Not really, just naive. Here is a question back to you: if you are at a restaurant and the table behind you is using this type of language, do you shrug it off or think &quot;wow, they are fucking idiots?&quot;<br />
<br />
If im at a restaurant and here some call someone a nigger or faggot, because words do not offend me. And obviously unless an all out brawl commences than the person the insult was directed at was not offended by the word either. I do not think of them as idiots because words get said that arnt meant in a state of extreme emotion, tell me that you've never called someone something you didnt mean when you were mad.<br />
<br />
I dont think this would hurt BL's recruitment in the slightest, if you want to join a top guild and have the skill to do so you have probably gotten called a faggot by a raid leader or called someone a faggot yourself. Plus they just proved that they are currently the best guild in the US, before it was more of a competition between them, Vodka and Premonition but they proved their worth today. Im sure a guild like Paragon swears a good amount as well, now I dont speak Swedish but im sure its there. And if the Paragon raid leader called someone a faggot on livestream do you really think people will stop wanting to be part of Paragon? come on now.</div></div><hr />

Yeah people moved on because Kobe was fined a lot of money for that incident. Since there's no one to hold them accountable like there was for him, a lot of people feel the need to take that responsibility on themselves. Whether that's &quot;needed&quot; or not is irrelevant. The bottom line is you can't say offensive things without someone taking you to task for it. And it's the way it should be.</div></div><hr />

Yes because different people express frustration in different ways. However, end game raiders tend to be thick skinned potty mouths. I've talked like this, my friends have talked like this and no one cares. I'm better friends with the people who cuss like sailors than the sissies who can't get over some words.</div></div><hr />

I quit this game years ago, but I watched the stream of this because I used to be in Blood Legion and I wanted to cheer them on. I will tell you that in my time not only in a &quot;good end game raid group,&quot; but in this specific guild, this language was not used. Was it testy sometimes? Sure. But not racial and homophobic slurs, and especially not on a stream more or less sponsored by Blizzard and with tens of thousands of viewers. This was extremely disappointing to me, and while I know that this kind of behavior does not, unfortunately, phase people within the bubble world of warcraft, as a guy that is no longer a part of this scene but still has a certain fondness for the high end game, and for the people I played with--this is not something to be proud of. There is no justification for this kind of conduct.</div></div><hr />

Saying it in the privacy of your friends ears and saying &quot;no one cares&quot; is pretty dumb. Obviously you hang out with less than intelligent people and that's your choice. Black people were held back in society for decades while slave drivers called them niggers. Even though none of the black people in my generation were slaves, they deserve the respect of not having to hear the word. It's on them whether they &quot;get over some words&quot; or not. Calling someone a fag that you know is not homosexual is one thing, but saying nigger while there's a black person 4 seats over is probably crossing the lines. I don't know though, I just chose to live my life respecting others. Even while I play a game. <br />
<br />
But, don't let a few bad apples in BL sour your thoughts on them. They've accomplished a lot and have done very well this tier. My point is, using racial slurs and homophobic slurs wasn't the &quot;make or break&quot; factor of their performance. They would have won whether they said those things or not. They just probably shouldn't have gone there.</div></div><hr />

They were calling each other &quot;faggots&quot; well after Rags was dead and many of them logged off. It wasn't a &quot;heat of the moment&quot; thing at that point.<br />

Raid guilds are no different than any other group; embarrass yourselves and you diminish your achievements. BL can say and do whatever they want, that is certainly true. If you are going to act stupid, then don't stream it. How hard is this to understand? Members of the guild have appeared in this thread to apologize for it and say as much. They should be applauded for acknowledging their mistakes as well as their triumph. Endlessly defending a position they themselves have deemed as inappropriate seems silly, don't you think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, please. No, I don't - at all. I'm saying what those members of BL wish they could say, but due to having to conform to your silly PC standards, they can't. They said what you wanted to hear, and good on them for appeasing the community so easily. I know what they're really saying in voice chat, post apology, and it isn't far off from my comments.<br />
<br />
My point remains - some of you make a big deal out of nothing. They're just words, and they certainly don't carry the connotations that people are accusing BL of expressing. This is just another example of drama queens latching onto an opportunity &amp; blowing the ramifications WAY out of the water.<br />
<br />
I appreciate BL giving &quot;fans&quot; the opportunity to watch them raid at such a competitive level, and giving us access to their inner workings that makes their raid tick. It's a shame the community feels the need to censor that for the rest of us who aren't forced to get hung up on the little things.</div></div><hr />

where any of you oh so offended white knights and defenders of political correctness forced to click on the BL stream ......NO <br />
once connected to the stream where you at any point forced to continue listening to said stream .....NO <br />
you people where invited to listend to a guilds live vent and watch a live event so effectivly invited into the normaly very private guild voice chat. (at that point a good percentage of you should of known what that was going to be like and if for some way out reason you didnt was made quite clear in its first couple of minutes) <br />
At any point did any of BL call you yourself directly any of the aformentioned racial or homophobic slurs during the stream .....NO <br />
<br />
you see if they find it acceptable to call each other that in their own space within their own guild then guess what they can regrdless of if you find it offensive or not get over ya damn selves should their guild vent/mumble/TS been broadcast live fuck no that was a seriouse mistake but its happened not one that will be repeated move on people there are more pressing things in this world to worry about that a few peolpe mouthing off on the internet</div></div><hr />

You are running under the impression that Paragon and Method operate under different situations... While I agree there is no place for racism... Bad language is an inherit part of the game like it or not especially when it comes to end game raiding. Furthermore they are humans we say the stupidest things some times when put under pressure. Does it make it alright? no but what more can BL do apart from apologize (which they have done) and move on. <br />
<br />
I would still just as a matter of interest like to see Paragon and Method duke it out though in a similar set up next year maybe... But if it were to occur Id be sure I wouldn't carry such high expectations that insinuate that these guys/girls are so perfect that an utterance of foul language did not escape their lips when put under stress. <br />

It's about the epithets used, the fact that they were used well after the &quot;stressful situation&quot; was over and while everyone was coming down from the high pressure. What's the excuse there? &quot;They're just words&quot;? No, they're not just words. They're incredibly volatile terms that have a history of violence attached to them. &quot;It's just a game&quot;? It is just a game, but it's not Solitaire or Minesweeper where you're alone. There are other people present, in-game, listening in and interacting with you on a daily basis. Have some respect for other people if you don't have any for yourself.

<br />
When you are dealing with people who won't shut up and keep telling you &quot;omg you guys are ahead by blah blah blah&quot; when you want people to stay focused, you'd say that a lot. Back in wrath I was in a top 100 guild, and it was MUCH worse than that. If you guys get your panties in a bunch over the way they raid and get shit done, don't watch/listen to them. If you saw the way vodka talked about BL on their website, you'd say both parties are immature. Raiding in a top end guild is EXTREMELY stressful, and most of the raid leaders/main tanks tend to turn into angry people. Get used to it or continue down the casual way of &quot;okay timmy you'll do better next time&quot;</div></div><hr />
