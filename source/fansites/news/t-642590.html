Ulduar Legendary Mace - Val'anyr, Hammer of the Ancient Kings<br />
Another day, another article. The page for Val'anyr, Hammer of the Ancient Kings (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=855) is now avalaible. This legendary mace will be dropped in Ulduar and is only available to healers according to the last information. <br />

PvP - Arenas<br />
Burst Damage<br />
We think this was a bigger problem when season 5 started than it is now. We managed to address some of the worst burst (Bubbled Ret pallies, Arcane Barrage, Mutilate+stun+stealth, Explosive Shot, Impurity + Howling Blast, and now finally Shadowfrost Icy Touch). At the same time, being able to call upon your burst when needed (blowing cooldowns etc.) is pretty important for being able to finish someone off before they can escape or get a heal. We won't have a very fun Arena if everyone is always hitting for 2000 damage (they just can't be hitting for 20,000 either).<br />
<br />
We have seen many fights now that won't wind down because the healers can just keep going and going forever. While we don't want fights to last for 6 seconds, we also don't want to see the only way a fight can end to be through mana drains (the spell effect itself, or just slowly, painfully watching someone's blue bar exhaust itself). Ideally both situations would sometimes occur, but there would also be more fights somewhere in the middle. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137366298-six-things-ruining-this-game.html))<br />
<br />
[...] We definitely designed a few classes originally in a way where all they bring is big burst. We have realized now that this doesn’t work. It ends up being not fun for the burster or the burstee. We are trying to redirect Ret, Arcane, and PvP rogues of all types away from the proverbial “two shot” and more towards having different answers for different situations. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137366298-six-things-ruining-this-game.html))<br />
<br />
Paladins and Death Knights too dominant<br />
We think DKs and Holy paladins are too dominant in Arenas. Beyond those two there are some imbalances, but you are going to find a lot of debate among the community about who it is, and I think that might come to dominate the rest of the thread. The &quot;two-shotting&quot; is a little exaggerated in most cases. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137366298-six-things-ruining-this-game.html))<br />
<br />
Resilience<br />
You don't need 800-1000 resilience to survive a Shatter combo. The game is designed around the notion that you will escape or prevent CC. You aren't going to survive long CC'd with players beating on you no matter how high your resilience is.<br />
<br />
I think what we might do differently next time is make higher resilience values available earlier. You start to notice resilience having an effect at say 500 or so and you start living long enough to counter attacks at 800 or so. A lot of players going into the season with 100 or so resilience did get blown up. This felt particularly weird because:<br />
<br />
1) For the last few seasons, their resilience had pretty much just gone up. Season 5 was a reset that had a lot more in common with Season 1.<br />
2) In addition, this was complicated by the issue above -- that players were combining the weak resilience with very potent PvE weapons that they had already looted from KT. If the Arena season had started around the same time Naxx had opened (combined with slightly better tuning on Naxx) then there would not have been such a discrepancy.<br />
3) Some classes had overly powerful built in resistances that made up for the lack of resilience. Specifically, DKs had a lot of cooldowns and passive defenses built in for tanking and paladins had their shields, which could be used offensively at the start of the season.<br />
<br />
To drag out a tired cliche, the combination of these 3 (low resilience, KT weapons and baked-in defenses) plus the high burst at the start of the season created a perfect storm for fast Arena deaths.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a better solution is to have relatively high resilience on the starter gear (like 500) but at the cost of offensive stats. We do want PvP gear to be a progression though. We don't want you to start the first season of an expansion with amazing resilience and offenses. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137366298-six-things-ruining-this-game.html))<br />

Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Converting Emblems of Heroism to Emblems of Valor<br />
We don't have any current plans to allow emblems of heroism to convert to emblems of valor. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/13393779860-trade-emblems-of-heroism-for-valor.html))<br />
<br />
Progression Path<br />
We consider 10 and 25 separate progression paths. Here are different ways to raid:<br />
<br />
A) Heroic 5 player -&gt; 10 player Naxx -&gt; 10 player Ulduar -&gt; 10 player Ulduar hard<br />
B) Heroic 5 player -&gt; 25 player Naxx -&gt; 25 player Ulduar -&gt; 25 player Ulduar hard<br />
C) Hybrid. You focus on A but sometimes pug B, or focus on B but run A on off nights. The one possible exception could be that if you are just stuck on 25 Ulduar hard, you can get upgrades by running 10 Ulduar hard if you are up to the challenge.<br />
<br />
If we made a mistake in LK, it was that path B was too easy. That meant that A felt like a waste to some players because the loot was inferior. We think it will work better in Ulduar. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14637425299-25-man-raids-more-difficult-false-assumption.html))<br />
<br />
25-Player content difficulty<br />
We have positioned our 25-player content as more difficult and therefore capable of generating better rewards. Managing a group of that size requires a little more effort and we figured if the rewards were the same, we'd steer pretty much everyone towards 10-player raiding. At this point we don't want to do that. The confusing part is that the 25-player content in Lich King ended up being a little on the easy side compared to the 10-player content. Players viewed the 25s as puggable which then made the 10s seem optional since the rewards weren't as good.<br />
<br />
If anything we think the 10 version in Ulduar will end up a little easier and more puggable. We'll probably see 10 and 25 Ulduar pugged eventually, but it might not happen right away. Let me add that if you just love 10-player raiding and are up to a challenge that we do have 10-player hard modes and the loot available there is superior to 25-player normal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14637425299-25-man-raids-more-difficult-false-assumption.html))<br />
<br />
25 Players vs. 10 Players raiding<br />
I understand your point on the 25 loot being of higher item level. However we explored this issue quite a bit and I still believe that some non-trivial number of players just prefer the larger raids. How can that be?<br />
<br />
-- They like the epic scale of it requiring an army of players to defeat a boss.<br />
-- They like the power mulitiplier. You generally do more damage and healing in 25 because you have more buffs. This feels cool.<br />
-- They like the encounters designed around larger groups. What I mean is that in a 25-player fight we can do things like just randomly kill players or isolate them in small groups. They like sometimes having to employ 4 tanks at once. It is hard to do these kinds of thing to 10-player fights.<br />
-- Their guilds were formed back in the day of exclusive 40 or 25 raiding, so that is the group of friends they have and how they have built their guild. They just think of the politicial nightmare if they have to split their guild in two.<br />
<br />
So for those reasons, and a few others, we think the smartest design is still just to let players decide if they prefer 10 player raiding or 25 player raiding. Some have a small group of friends and want to not have to put up with the weak links or undependables. They like the pressure it puts on every player to perform. Others have large, social guilds and like to assemble 25 players together. They may be more tolerant of being able to bring the 25th player along even if he isn't stellar. They may like all of the reasons I mentioned above. It's just a preference, just like Horde vs. Alliance is a preference.

&quot;Hardcore&quot; elements of the game<br />
Our goal has always been to make the game as accessible to as many players as possible. Our game is influenced by what we've learned from both our successes and our mistakes. Some of the &quot;hardcore&quot; elements of the past that some players think they now miss weren't even necessarily intended to be &quot;hardcore&quot;, but rather ended up that way because a better way wasn't yet available. <br />
<br />
Engineering<br />
Developer Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/15973347942-enraged-and-crazy-gnomish-eng-demands-answer.html))<br />
1. Could we have some elucidation of what perks engineering has that in the developers view &quot;work out compared to what other classes (sic) have&quot;?<br />
The perks are the glove enchants. The armor increase on the gloves should about match up to what stamina would be there instead, the haste boost can be really useful on some classes (whether it's just faster healing or faster damage), and the damage from the rocket launchers should be about equivalent to the dps boost that perks from other professions provide.<br />
<br />
If we wanted the perks for every profession to be the same, we would just add 50 stamina for having one profession and then 50 attack power/spell power for having another one - but we would rather keep the perks a little more unique and fitting for each profession. <br />
<br />
2 . What is the problem in providing a drop for goggle upgrades? (doesn't have to be BIS, we'd just like goggles that are ballpark competitive).<br />
We don't want to provide really good and/or best-in-slot items that you upgrade throughout an expansion. We kind of set a precedent for this in The Burning Crusade, but we weren't happy with it so we are trying to get away from it now. <br />
<br />
3 . Whilst the mote extractor was finally a means of making some money in TBC, the pretty much universal view of engineers is that as a help to get money in WOTLK it doesn't work pretty well. Can we swap Northrend motes for something cool to drop in Uldaar in 3.1.x?<br />
This can probably vary a bit depending on the demand from one realm to another. We think it is okay as it is for the time being. <br />
<br />
4. Do the developers have plans to seriously review engineering in 3.2?<br />
There are no plans for an overhaul if that is what you mean, but we will continue to watch all professions and make changes as we feel they are needed. <br />
<br />
5. Is there ever any prospect of some of the vanilla Wow favourites like the MC caps (with strictly no arena caveats) capable of being used again? <br />
Items like the mind control cap would not be usable in Battlegrounds or Arenas. Balancing an unbalanced item is extremely problematic if not impossible. There is a much greater possibility of toy items that don't provide an extreme advantage or have crazy scaling being updated than something like a mind control cap.<br />
<br />
There is always the possibility for more changes and tweaks to how things work, like removing an activation effect from the global cooldown and such, but this profession is especially challenging to balance between PvP and PvE. There are quite a few high level PvP players that use this profession because of the extra burst it can supply, so if you feel the damage is not enough, it is difficult to just increase the numbers when it is already powerful in PvP. <br />
<br />
Lightning Gnomish Generator damage nerf<br />
The burst was higher than we wanted, we lowered the burst but put passive crit on the item. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/15973347942-enraged-and-crazy-gnomish-eng-demands-answer.html))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Changes postponed for the next patch<br />
I am not sure where you get your information, but do yourself a favor and cut them off. There weren't any class changes that didn't make it into this patch that are now being planned for the next patch. Class balance changes just don't work like that.<br />
<br />
If you're referring to the hunter ammunition change, that's not quite as simple as just a &quot;normal class change&quot;, and we decided to wait on that because we have some cool plans for how we're going to design the change. <br />
<br />
Delay before classes balancing<br />
We are more quick to balance in LK than we were in BC. However, as a counterpoint, you can find plenty of posts by players who feel that they have whiplash from too many changes. We need to evalaute carefully when we think a change is warranted and keep both extremes in mind. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137366298-six-things-ruining-this-game.html))<br />

Power Word: Barrier (Group version of Power Word: Shield)<br />
I thought the disc priest group bubble thing got pushed back? Did I hear wrong?<br />
No, we decided against that change completely. We were considering a &quot;power barrier&quot; for discipline 3.1.0, as we do think it's a really cool idea. With that being said, it's not something currently on our to-do list, but it's possible we could revisit the idea somewhere down the road.

<br />
The problem with Eng is that once people find a use for it in pvp they overuse it.<br />
This first happened with the boots and now with the trinket.<br />
And no, its doesn't require mad skill to run a 3s team with 2-3 people having the trinket, wich basically drops a target to 50-60% from just that alone if timed correctly.</div></div><hr />

it's not like rerolling another class wich takes tremendous amount of time lvling, gearing and getting to know the class.<br />

<br />
<br />
Agreed on this tbh. Engineering never rly was a good proffesion to begin with, it doesnt provide any improvement to gear, except for &quot;fun&quot; stuff. Make most Engineer stuff Engineers ONLY like the Mechano-hog, ammo crates etc. There should be a reason to get Engineering for some classes other then the OP engineering trinket that gets nerfed next week.<br />
People should be able to spot an engineer when he passes, surrounded with weird gadgets. Add some gadgets to put on gear that are superb over some of the enchants/lw/gems or whatever. Engineering is one of those professions where there are no limits when it comes to creating something original. Why cant they think of something to make this profession worthwhile? I consider rerolling JC every day, but the money invested in Engineering, and the hope for an improvement stop me from doing this.<br />
<br />
About burst dmg nerfs to Explosive shot, Survival Hunters still havent gotten anything that makes them survive after the 6 sec nuke failed. The countless times i died while being in deterrence against melee is just sad. Nerf their burst and CC without anything in return. We still dont have any counter against dots that tick for 2k a sec, or an ability to counter a stun without having to use trinket instantly.<br />
<br />
Thats how things happend for the class since release of WOTLK. TNT + Explosive was good (not op), but when they nerf it they also take a piece of wyvern sting, trap slow effect, entrapment, trap mastery, sniper training, blackarrow on trap cd without any logical reason other then classes QQing about not being able to use their spammable CCs while wyvern stinged. Other pure DPS classes like Rogues, Mages and Warlocks are able to spam CC's without any penalty while the defenceless Hunter gets shit for breakfast. Still having &quot;target to close&quot; issues, a shit melee, shit armor, shit survival, shit kiting in small arena maps with LOS issues, pet issues, mana issues for longer lasting fights having to sacrifice a huge portion of their dps. Cant they see every Hunter is taking Crab pets to arena only for Roar of Sacrifice desperatly gasping for some uptime.<br />
<br />
Why just not make ALL breakable and dispellable CC's on a 6 sec duration, and all Stuns on a 2-4 sec duration, same with silences like Counterspell wich is just insane for any healer. Every CC should break upon a sertain amount of dps taken so no class is able to completly gimp down a player while unable to fight back. Add cooldowns (even a small one) on spammable CC's. Cloth classes survivabilty &gt; Every mail class atm, and their DPS and CC is suberb, and remains so in 3.1.<br />
<br />
Call S5 a test season or something.. it just cant be taken serious. The amount of DK/Palas with the frostwyrms is gonna be hilarious, and wont recieve any respect from anyone. Cant blaim em for abusing their OPness the entire Season.. hell i would do the same probably, but i wouldnt reroll just for fotm as many ppl have. Seeing many clueless ppl on my server rerolling a dk or pala to get in line for the title just makes me sick.<br />
<br />
I have hopes S6 will be better then S5 since ive seen the gear improvements and the class changes. However i predict Warriors and Shamans will dominate 2v2 now. Blizzard tends to overnerf or overbuff sertain specs so easily, and keeps appoligizing for every mistake they make. Its to predictable, its not even funny.</div></div><hr />

I don't know, but some of the devs at blizzard are completely clueless..<br />
<br />
How on earth does the engineering glove enchant come out as the engineering perk?<br />
It doesn't even come close to the +32 stats that EVERY OTHER profession has. (besides tailoring)<br />
<br />
Aside that, the rocket launchers don't even come close to being interesting enough, let alone the haste enchant.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Do the developers have plans to seriously review engineering in 3.2?<br />
There are no plans for an overhaul if that is what you mean, but we will continue to watch all professions and make changes as we feel they are needed. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sigh.<br />
Time to re-roll professions and leave Engineering to the bloody twinks.</div></div><hr />

So far, Paladin seems like the best choice becaouse of the large heals they make, and spam<br />
Druid on the other hand will get the lowest benefit of the mace (imo)<br />

But all in all most guilds will probably give it to their best healer, not depending on the class</div></div><hr />

<br />
Btw ,hunters are more then fine and so do are on PTR too!<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually im a 100% pvp orientated 2.2k+ rated Hunter trying to push it with a resto shaman in 2v2, and trying to faceroll hunt/pala/dk to 2250 for a rank at least (atm 2150). 2v2 we only face Pala/DK and win them loads, but they still manage to do 2x the dmg i do. I satisfy myself with the thought im just better skilled. I barerly see anything other then pala/dk and thats my personal experience. Besides, i didnt talk about Hunters atm, but what i see for them in 3.1.<br />
<br />
Besides that, ive always managed to get 2.2k+ in previous seasons so i aint facerolling S5. Hunter/Pala/Dk is still hard vs RMP wich dominate my BG. Yes Hunters are better then ever now, but get nerfed in 3.1 thats my point. It doesnt take away the fact they dont get anything in return. You talk about Hunter balance, but IMO Hunters are just fine and dont need balance other then TNT stun removal. But if they remove the DPS and CC they should buff their survival aspect.<br />
<br />
You must have rerolled a DK or Pala if you cant see 2v2 is DK/Pala dominated. Or you just didnt got high enough in rating to experience that. And eventhough i might be in line for glad this season, i still think it was shit.</div></div><hr />

This seems to be totally untrue now, it would help if you would read the updated proc linked in this post. The new proc suggests that shields given will be equal to 15% of the healing done to that target (all magical heals it appears so that includes HoTs) over 15 seconds - an additive shield similar to the new Divine Aegis if I am not mistaken. This means that the mace is most likely best off in the hands of your healer that does the most effective healing consistently - be that a Druid, Paladin, Shaman or Priest.</div></div><hr />

I think this is due to the way content is tuned in 3.1 with 25 man content being more difficult than 10 man content, therefore a Legendary should drop or be gained only from the harder of two options.</div></div><hr />

The wording is similiar to other effects that gets 4 chances to procc off a CH and 6 off a CoH, so classes with aoe heals should be able to get a significantly higher uptime. Depends a lot on if there is a hidden cooldown or not. I'm pretty sure that it will be best in slot for all healing classes for quite some time. The procc itself should be worth 5-25% throughput depending on implementation/fight, and it will probably have an inflated ilvl too, causing great stats. Whether or not there will be a better weapon in Icecrown is hard to say, it's far from certain, but even if such a weapon exists that patch is probably a year away.<br />
<br />
Engineering and GLG: Sure, everyone can pick up the profession if they want, so it's not unfair in that way. However, it's retarded to balance arenas around every single player having a non-GCD nuke for 3k every minute. How much would they need to nerf the damage of every single dps class to make it possible to survive double, triple or quintuple GLG bursts? Bandit's insignia is also kind of retarded, but at least can't be reliable timed with cc/silences meaning it's not that much different than getting a crit or two more. Professions that introduce new spells and mechanics is just not fair for arena play. Rocket boots should probably also be removed. Alchemist healing/mana pots probably doesn't make enough of a difference to be a problem, same with JC trinkets. Engineering glove enchants are cutting it close, but are acceptable.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure where you get your information, but do yourself a favor and cut them off. There weren't any class changes that didn't make it into this patch that are now being planned for the next patch. Class balance changes just don't work like that.<br />
<br />
If you're referring to the hunter ammunition change, that's not quite as simple as just a &quot;normal class change&quot;, and we decided to wait on that because we have some cool plans for how we're going to design the change.<br />
<br />
this made me laugh. hard. I could name a half dozen class changes off the top of my head they have said are coming, but are not ready for 3.1. in addition to the ammo, things like the pally crusader strike changes, druid skins changes, the fact they've been promising to fix shamen totems for months/years now (and i'm sorry, combining posion cleansing and disease cleansing and making mana spring not stack with blessing of wisdom is not the &quot;fixing&quot;).</div></div><hr />

The following items have never been upgraded since Vanilla WoW, and could use some (I took the death ray out. GLG fits the bill):<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mech. Sheep<br />
Harvest Reaper<br />
Discombobulator<br />
Reflectors<br />
EZ-throw dynamite<br />
<br />
<br />
Mind Control Cap<br />
Deep Dive Helmet<br />
Shrink Ray<br />
Cloaking Device<br />
Target Dummy<br />
<br />
Flash Bomb<br />
Universal Remote<br />
Net launcher<br />
<br />
<br />
We get what in WotLK?<br />
<br />
<br />
Two new bombs<br />
Goggles that are worse than Naxx-level, replaceable completely by BoE Blacksmithing<br />
Combo tools/Gnomish Army knife (A great idea. Fits the concept and is also cheap and sellable)<br />
Mailbox with an insane cooldown.<br />
Tinkers (A good start, keep the use effects so that it feels like additional trinkets rather than crummy enchanting)<br />
A ground mount<br />
<br />
<br />
And don't get me started on the Motorcycle. Yes, it rocks looks-wise. However, the engineer adds what engineer specific parts, some bolts? Wow, I don't feel like I engineered this from experimental plans, I feel like I bought a &quot;Build-a-Bike&quot; kit from the goblin IKEA. Also, I want goggle upgrades, but Blizz says they don't want upgraded items... for some reason? I don't know why. I liked my goggles, people sure seemed to be fans of Skillherald. Who cares about the dang mailbox? If its cooldown is longer than a hearth it doesn't matter. This would be a big deal if this was pre-BC and there wasn't an Inn + Mailbox + Flightpath + Pile of Vendors every 10 feet. I'm thinking of Burning Steppes/Searing Gorge pre-Thorium Point. Was there always an inn in WPL? I don't remember.<br />
<br />
I like the tinkers. Put my &quot;Things that need Upgrades&quot; list on tinkers and you've got me hook, line and sinker. Put them on belts and even better.<br />
<br />
The following (Wrath) factions give anything for engineers:<br />
<br />
<br />
Horde/Allys for the bike<br />
Nobody else<br />
<br />
<br />
There is one faction reward for engineers. There were two from BC, but who is counting them? Flares are good for telling nubs where to run on Loken and seaforium is useless because there aren't any more chests. For JCs? Alchemists? Enchanters? Tons of stuff.<br />
<br />
I want five things 1) Upgrade our flavor trinkets/devices! 2) Give us a daily quest system! Have us craft old world engineering devices and grab some Northrend mats to create new upgraded versions. The reward can be tokens used to purchase recipes for the upgraded Northrend devices. 3) Add recipes to factions! 4) Re-purpose the failure system. Have it apply only to non-engineers or people who have below a certain level of engineering. But still have a chance to succeed for non-engineers or lower level engineers. Give us something to sell if you are serious about removing our ability to craft ammo for repeat customers. 5) Clean up the dang recipe window! I am serious about 5. Three &quot;Misc&quot; headings, one &quot;Devices&quot; heading, a &quot;Parts&quot; heading AND a &quot;Trash&quot; heading? Seriously? How are we supposed to find things? Five is an easy fix that would take at most an hour. Just patch it in already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean seriously. You said so yourself that you can't spare the time needed to organize a 25 man. Therefore it's more difficult. Therefore those people should have better rewards. And making 2 separate shards, are you serious? So, assuming someone happens to have better luck in a 10 man they may get all their shards before someone who does 25 mans and get the same reward? You prefer a smaller group of people, therefore it's YOUR choice to do 10 mans, and it's YOUR choice to not be able to get legendary items. How can you not realize this without someone pointing it out to you???<br />

Principle #1: To alter something leadint towards a better end product..i.e..suping something up..making it faster and larger..son on and so forth.<br />
<br />
Principle #2: To devise ways over moving past obstacles when no present conditions exist to do so, this is more relatable to the Army Crops of Engineers.<br />
<br />
With those 2 principles in mind you could offer the follwing things with relative ease and would be considered the role of an actual engineer:<br />
<br />
1. So many places in Naxx had treachorous areas that it you didnt do just right could result in massive damage/death...the example that comes to mind is the green river in Patchwerk's area...engineers with a couple mats should be able to build a temporary bridge to allow the raid to cross...as well the pipeway up top in Plaque quarter can be a nuissance if you should happen to fall..so why not have engineers be able to make a rope ladder allowing any fallen individuals to climb back up quicker that having to go all the way back around.<br />
<br />
2. Constructing little personal guardians was always a great thing to do in Vanilla WoW..sorry but exploding sheep's just way too much fun...allow engineers to make personal guardians for themselves or specified party members(healers and/or squishy's)with around 12k health and a duration of a couple minutes...and healable...its something thats unique and can prevent a wipe sometimes if done right.<br />
<br />
3. Modding guns/bows/crossbows with special effects..why hasnt this been done yet...maybe engineers can give a lvl stock gun specific stats...not over-engorged ones but decent and maybe a special attack..poison..fire..frost...you name it.<br />
<br />
4. Repairing siege vehicles under any circumstances would be a definitely outstanding idea...have a required item like a handymans toolbox that could allow to fix damage on a siege engine in either PvE or PvP.<br />
<br />
im sure theres more but ive lost my train of thought...but these would definitely help and be to over the top...as i can hear the streams of anguish from other professions begin to bubble with apathy and outrage.</div></div><hr />

Constructing little personal guardians was always a great thing to do in Vanilla WoW..sorry but exploding sheep's just way too much fun...allow engineers to make personal guardians for themselves or specified party members(healers and/or squishy's)with around 12k health and a duration of a couple minutes...and healable...its something thats unique and can prevent a wipe sometimes if done right.<br />
<br />
3. Modding guns/bows/crossbows with special effects..why hasnt this been done yet...maybe engineers can give a lvl stock gun specific stats...not over-engorged ones but decent and maybe a special attack..poison..fire..frost...you name it.<br />
<br />
4. Repairing siege vehicles under any circumstances would be a definitely outstanding idea...have a required item like a handymans toolbox that could allow to fix damage on a siege engine in either PvE or PvP.<br />
<br />
im sure theres more but ive lost my train of thought...but these would definitely help and be to over the top...as i can hear the streams of anguish from other professions begin to bubble with apathy and outrage.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like your ideas. 1.) Great Idea, I'm ashamed I never thought of it. 2.) I miss my sheep and my harvest reaper. I miss my Dragonling. How hard would it be to have a Khorium Nether Dragon, or a Saronite Proto-Drake? Not that hard. 3.) More scopes would be great. Keep both the +AP ones and +Crit ones. Add in some gyros for +hit. Add a +Haste rocket for weapons (Battle Angel Rocket Hammer FTW). Give us a Poison Tank (or Flame Tank) we can add to guns or bows that on use makes the next attack deal poison or fire damage. 4.) Was I the only one who wanted the EMP belt to function on vehicles as well as mechanical mobs? I don't think so. Give us a Nitro Kit that when used on a vehicle grants us a temporary speed boost. Or a Toolkit that gives a HOT. Then put an engineer in the turret seat of a Siege tank and watch it own all.<br />
<br />
And now you've added even more to my wishlist.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Combat Chicken as a permanent pet would be cool. (Or one of the other mechanicals, they'd emulate the same pet commands as your class' proper pet) Nothing hard hitting or high utility, but something cool, there, and noticeable.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd love a permanent pet. It would make hunters want to choke my paladin, but BRK isn't looking so we might get away with it. I'd love a mechanical dog or something that I can use to boost my DPS when I'm ret or tank for me while I flash the daylights out of it when I'm holy.</div></div><hr />

I mean seriously. You said so yourself that you can't spare the time needed to organize a 25 man. Therefore it's more difficult. Therefore those people should have better rewards. And making 2 separate shards, are you serious? So, assuming someone happens to have better luck in a 10 man they may get all their shards before someone who does 25 mans and get the same reward? You prefer a smaller group of people, therefore it's YOUR choice to do 10 mans, and it's YOUR choice to not be able to get legendary items. How can you not realize this without someone pointing it out to you???<br />
<br />
But don't worry, Blizzard listens to QQ'ers so you'll probably get your way. <br />

I'd agree with you if current 25 man content was actually more difficult. Sorry, but I gauge difficulty by complexity of encounter and player skill involved, not by time spent organizing the damn thing. I just refuse to put up with 25 people's bull.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to see Blizzard do with 10-man vs. 25-man with regards to difficulty is this: 10 man regular &lt; 25 man regular, but 10 man hard ~= 25 man hard, and make the hard mode loot only half a tier or so apart, rather than a full 13 ilevels like it is now. In that case, it would make perfect sense to have fragments of Val'anyr drop in both 10 and 25 man hard modes; just make 10 man drop fewer / at a lower rate. If Blizzard is really going with their whole equality/&quot;bring the player&quot; mentality, this makes perfect sense to me.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has stated that 25 man Ulduar will be harder than 10 man. Besides, the ONLY thing harder about 10 man content right now is Sarth + drakes. Mainly because 10 people is easier to manage than 25. <br />
<br />
How much easier is it to get Undying than Immortal? Shocking than Heroic:Shocking? You Don't Have an Eternity than Heroic: You Don't Have an Eternity? I don't think I've ever seen anyone with the heroic versions and not the 10 mans, unless they just don't do 10 mans. Can you honestly tell me that, minus Sarth3D, Heroic: Glory of the Raider is easier to obtain than Glory of the Raider??? <br />
<br />
Besides, 10 man 3D isn't as hard as everyone says it is...again mostly because only 10 people have to avoid void zones and flame walls vs 25. It took us a total of 3 hours of attempts to get 25 man, and 2.5 hours of attempts to get 10 man. You just have to have a more specific comp with 10 man.</div></div><hr />

I'm not talking about achievements. I'm talking about fights. In 25 man, you can faceroll your way through the bosses. You can kill Noth before he teleports; you'd be hard pressed to do that in 10 man. You can kill Anub'rekhan right around the first locust swarm, and even if he hits it you can just heal the tank through it; you have the heals and DPS to spare. In 10 man, you actually have to do the fights. I'll agree that the Immortal and Shocking are harder on 25 man, but that's just because it's harder to force 25 people to pay attantion and there's a much higher chance of someone lagging and dying. If you're not going for immortal/shocking and someone crosses charges on Thaddius and dies, you'll just kill him with 24 people with no extra effort from anyone, it'll just take you a few seconds longer.<br />
<br />
Looking at the final line of your reply, &quot;You just have to have a more specific comp with 10 man.&quot; Isn't that very similar to what you claimed was harder about 25 man in your OTHER reply? &quot;You said so yourself that you can't spare the time needed to organize a 25 man.

I was only talking about Sarth 3D, and I already said that 10 man 3D was the only thing harder than 25 man so that's a moot point. Blizzard fucked up on that one - and no other 10 man fights require specific classes. Oh and guess what, if we're not talking about achievements like you say, oh yeah...Sarth 3D is an achievement...<br />
<br />
I don't know why you have so much trouble in your 10 mans. Perhaps you should run then with the same people as your 25 mans. Funny that you say the tank can stand there and be healed through Locust Swarm on Anub in 25 man considering any healer that is in range of healing the tank will be silenced by Locust Swarm...but w/e.<br />
<br />
I won't say that 25 man Naxx is necessarily harder than 10 man...but then you also have 25 people who need loot, unless you want to 10 man heroic Naxx which makes it harder than normal...I'm tired of everyone complaining about not getting the same gear from 10 man as 25 man. Really. That's like saying you should be able to get gear from 5 mans that's equivalent to gear from 10 mans. Oh wait...</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I don't care that 25 mans get better gear. They should. They're more annoying. I just think that you should be able to get the only legendary from either. That's all. I don't run 25 mans with any regularity. That doesn't mean I don't want a challenge, and I wish people would realize that sometimes 10 man vs. 25 man doesn't mean casual vs. hardcore.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, Sarth 3D is a little more than an achievement. It GIVES you an achievement, but it actually changed the mechanics of the fight, instead of, like Shocking for example, just rewarding you for doing the fight without any mistakes. It also gives different loot, so it's really a hard mode, not an achievement.</div></div><hr />

We put BoL on the MT/OT and heal everyone around it, and with the HL glyph that wil allso provide 5 others to get the buff. Then we have BoL and this wil give all 25 members of the raid a change getting the buff especially if this can be up 100% of the time. So we can provide everyone of the raid with the buff and prio on the tanks by giving them HL while BoL is active.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with that philosophy is that it's wrong. 10-man guilds ARE more casual than 25-man guilds because 10-man raids require far fewer people putting forth far less time than people doing heroic raids.<br />
<br />
On top of which, Blizzard doesn't want to make the same mistakes they made in BC. They want legendaries to be more exclusive, as they were originally. You didn't see anywhere near as many people with either Thunderfury, Sulfuros, or Ateish at 60 as you did people at 70 in BC having Warglaives or that stupid Sunwell bow. Making legendaries drops was a stupid mistake on their part, and I'm pretty sure the super elite QQed until the cows came home.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that legendary items are intended to be the ultimate reward for the ultimate success in the largest scales possible. There were no legendaries in 20-mans in vanilla, there were no legendaries in ZA or Kara, there won't be any legendaries in any 10-man raid version in Wrath. That's how they always worked, that's how they always will. If you want a legendary? Do heroic raids. If that's not your cup of tea? You don't want a legendary.<br />
<br />
It's just that simple. Sorry to disappoint you.</div></div><hr />

It gets old.<br />
<br />
25 man raids require more people, more time, more concentration, and have higher standards for instance/encounter abilities, hence, they give better rewards. I read some guy post that he prefers to raid with 10 people in a smaller group, and he doesn't want to put up with 25 peoples' bull.<br />

<br />
Lets not forget that in 25mans you ALWAYS have ALL raid buffs, where in 10mans you cant. Often you will have only 1 paladin, maybe even no paladins...ever tried to heal without BoW/BoK? Sometimes you will have no shaman...so no pritty totems. <br />
The buffs you get in 25mans are ridiculously good. I dont even pay attention to my mana bar with so much regen i get.<br />

The only challenging aspect for 25mans is for the raid leader organizing groups etc. So actually the part BEFORE starting a certain boss is the hardest. However the need for individual performance is severly decreased in 25 mans.

While I understand your point, it is moot. <br />
1) You are not considering difficult encounters, Naxx is a joke. Take almost any of the SW fights no way in hell you are carrying anyone through (pre nerf), keep in mind you may not have a appropriate view of the topic if you never did these encounters.<br />
2) Fight mechanics change from 25-10 man now, you will see more complexed fights being simplified for 10 mans.<br />
3) Space, the instance remains the same size expect on mimiron (or other aoe bosses) to have a lot easier time spreading out in 10 man vs 25 etc..<br />
4) Look at the 10 man 3d sarth 76sec kill, it is not possible in 25 because the hp scaling isn't proportional to number of players.</div></div><hr />
