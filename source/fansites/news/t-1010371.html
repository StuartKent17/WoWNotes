Blizzard Insider #42 -- Meet the Pandaren Monk<br />
With the launch of the next World of Warcraft® expansion, the Mists of Pandaria™ will lift to reveal the pandaren, a long-secluded race that has spent generations mastering the way of the monk -- World of Warcraft’s newest playable class. <br />
<br />
To get an inside look at the upcoming World of Warcraft race and class options, the Blizzard Insider recently sat down with Lead Systems Designer Greg “Ghostcrawler” Street to discuss the design decisions that went into creating the pandaren monk. So read on, and be among the first to meet the brawling heroes who are, even now, secretly training within the mists. <br />
<br />
Blizzard Insider: How will the pandaren race differ from the other races of Azeroth? What ideas are being explored for their racial abilities? <br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler: Ultimately, the challenge with races is to make them feel unique without actually providing them with so much power that players feel like they don’t have a choice in which race they want to be. If tauren are the best warriors, then Horde players might feel like they are sacrificing too much in order to try out a different race or stick with a race they really like. With the pandaren, you probably won’t see anything so amazing that everyone gravitates to them… except that their art and animation is just so wonderful.<br />
<br />
The biggest difference for the pandaren is that they can join the Horde or the Alliance, which is something we’ve never tried before. That alone will make them feel unique. They also have a very strong cultural kit. Our trolls might be somewhat Jamaican and the draenei have Eastern European accents, but the pandaren have a very strong Asian influence. That affects everything from their animations -- which have a martial arts vibe, even for non-monks -- to their hairstyles.<br />
<br />
For racial abilities, we’re giving them a bonus to cooking… and to eating. We’re also giving them a moderate bonus to rested experience to make it less daunting to level one all the way up to level 90. They also get the mystical-martial ability to paralyze opponents by touching their pressure points. Finally, we came up with a silly racial, Bouncy, that causes them to take less falling damage. While the pandaren are as noble and epic as any of our races, we felt like we had to acknowledge their, shall we say, endomorphic body shape in some way.<br />
<br />
Of course, as with any design this early out, this may all change by the time the new expansion goes live.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Insider:How did the team decide on monks as the new playable class? Were there any other ideas that were considered?<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler: We settled on the pandaren race first, and after that, the new class was a no-brainer. We actually did discuss whether World of Warcraft needed a new class at this time. As awesome as they are, it was disruptive to add the death knight, and it took us some time to get them feeling fun and balanced. Ultimately, though, we decided the time was right, and at that point the big decision was whether the new class would be a Brewmaster specifically, or a monk that you could play with a Brewmaster kit. At the moment, we’re going with the tank being the Brewmaster, but that could change.<br />
<br />
Insider:How will the monk differ from other classes?<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler: We’re trying a few different things. For now, the monk has no auto-attack, which is unique among melee classes. The monk has a different resource as players might expect, where they have both light and dark resources that power different abilities. We are even trying to have the monk healing spec use a lot of punches and kicks. While monk characters will care about weapons, and weapons contribute to their damage and healing, you don’t see the weapons in a lot of attacks. We save them for some of the big finishers.<br />
<br />
From a non-gameplay standpoint, the most noticeable difference is the huge number of animations the monk has. When you think of a magic-using class, you think of a lot of splashy spell effects. With the monk we thought it made more sense to invest heavily in animation, and the artists really delivered on that.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/pandamonk2_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/pandamonk2.jpg)<br />
<br />
Insider:How are you structuring the monk’s talent tree?<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler: Well, the talent tree design overall is changing dramatically in Mists of Pandaria. Each class will just have one talent tree with a lot of attractive -- and hard -- decisions. However, like other classes, the monk will have three different specializations available at level 10. For now, we are calling these for the melee damage spec, Brewmaster for the tanking spec, and Mistweaver for the healing spec. The Brewmaster should have the feel of dodging and weaving in combat, reminiscent of the drunken master from martial arts flicks. The Windwalker will be the kung fu master who beats the crap out of opponents with fists and feet. The Mistweaver is partially the wise healer archetype, but like the old men in martial arts movies, he can beat down his enemies as well.<br />
<br />
It’s also worth pointing out that even though many races can be monks, the story of the game is that it is the pandaren who introduce the ways of the monk to the Alliance and the Horde, so even non-pandaren monks will have a strong Pandarian -- the continent -- kit. <br />
<br />
Insider:What are the challenges involved in adding a new class to the game? Were there any specific things you learned from the addition of the death knight class in Wrath of the Lich King that you hope to apply to the monk?<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler: Adding a class is one of the most challenging things we can do. There are a couple of mistakes we made with the death knight that we’d like to avoid. The death knight resource model, for example, ends up feeling really complicated. We also had some balance problems early on, partially based on -- possibly biased -- feedback that the death knight felt weak. We didn’t want our brand-new class to feel neglected, so we overdid it a bit. Then when we got them back in line, it felt to the death knight players like we had pulled the rug out from under them. On the other hand, the death knight is a really iconic character for World of Warcraft, and the class abilities and spell effects really deliver on that fantasy. We need to make sure the monk feels just as cool and really delivers on what players expect a monk to play like.<br />

<br />
Insider:How will monks be itemized? <br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler: They wear leather armor, so the tank and DPS monks will want the same Agility-based armor that rogues and Feral druids wear. The healing monk will want the Intellect-based armor worn by Balance and Resto druids. For weapons, the two signature items are fists and staves. At the moment, we are focusing the Windwalker on fists and the Brewmaster on staves, but we might give players more flexibility than that. The melee monks can also use weapons like one-handed maces, axes, and swords. The Mistweaver can use healer staves, maces, axes, and swords. Monks can’t use shields, and no melee class uses ranged weapons any longer.<br />
<br />
Insider:Thanks for your time. Is there anything else you’d like to share before you go?<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler: One of the victories we had with the death knight came when we introduced a fun ability at relatively low level that became synonymous with the class. I’m talking about Death Grip, which lets the death knight yank enemies over to him. We decided we needed something similar for the monk, so we came up with Roll. Roll is like a combination between warrior Charge and mage Blink. Unlike those two abilities, Roll can be used sideways or backwards as well. It looks great to see a character, a pandaren especially, tuck into a somersault. It’s a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />

Yeah... no.<br />
<br />
For now, the monk has no auto-attack, which is unique among melee classes.<br />
Let's hope it stays unique.<br />
<br />
At the moment, we are focusing the Windwalker on fists[...]<br />
My shammy is worried about this part. Also, Blizzard, please do not attach the Monk class to the Protector token (if you're thinking about it). :/<br />
<br />
When you think of a magic-using class, you think of a lot of splashy spell effects.<br />
What splashy spell effects? The original animation for Mass Dispel, the Divine Aegis bubble that you thought was &quot;confusing&quot;, etc, etc? -_-</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrunkenBeard</div><div class="date">2011-10-28, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah cause double ammount of stats from food buff and 3 sec instanc cc aint good enough... double ammount of stats with current food means for example 90 agi and 90 stam, how does 1% crit of worgen for example stand up to this? tough its more like 100 agility and over 100 agility for some speccs... 3 sec cc instant cc will be too strong in pvp aswell...<br />
They said in the Q&amp;A that the 100% was a placeholder (as is everything else this early in the development life cycle).</div></div><hr />

It's frankly a bit asinine that the only physical DPS spec that uses polearms in particular (which unlike staves are only itemized for physical DPS) is a spec in which the polearm is not wielded or even visible. I hope Windwalker, like DK Frost spec, has a choice to DW or 2H.</div></div><hr />

Fixed that for you Greg Street. No they could just gave us a class and they also give us pandaren I think its freaking cool and its really nice to play pandaren wether you are horde or alliance.... I really love it</div></div><hr />

Players have been asking for this type of feature with races for years, and actually wanted it implemented with Goblins. So its a win-win for both sides, players get what they want (while also removing the silhouette &quot;design&quot; from pvp with both a race and Xmog), and Blizz cuts back on development time and money cost for it. This also means the expansion will be pushed out sooner than previous ones, and they will make up &quot;losses&quot; from Cataclysm by banking on the thrill of new content. <br />
<br />
I don't necessarily like paying for another expansion so soon, but from a business perspective this is a smart move on Blizzards part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've always been legit. You're aware that MMO-Champion is owned by Curse right?<br />
<br />
Malware wasn't coming from Curse, but (as far as I know) from fake or infected addons that got uploaded, but not cleaned or checked by Curse.</div></div><hr />

Now seriously, Blizzcon panels were awesome, but those subsequent &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;, &quot;interviews&quot;,and such are just a bunch of nothing. There is no real new information, no new subjects, no unfolding of what have been presented at Blizzcon. It's just air time, with them appearing and trying to be noticed. I rather wait for REAL new stuff for weeks, than see them every other day giving us more of the same.</div></div><hr />

Yeah... no.<br />
<br />
For now, the monk has no auto-attack, which is unique among melee classes.<br />
Let's hope it stays unique.<br />
<br />
At the moment, we are focusing the Windwalker on fists[...]<br />
My shammy is worried about this part. Also, Blizzard, please do not attach the Monk class to the Protector token (if you're thinking about it). :/<br />
<br />
When you think of a magic-using class, you think of a lot of splashy spell effects.<br />
What splashy spell effects? The original animation for Mass Dispel, the Divine Aegis bubble that you thought was &quot;confusing&quot;, etc, etc? -_-<br />
<br />
1. No class is balanced.<br />
2. No other melee class can be redesigned from the ground up and balanced around having no auto attack. It would take an entire expansion (no, not this one) to implement. They're not going to do that anyways.<br />
3. I'm sorry you shammy is worried but its no worse than when Rogues started using your axes. Part of this game is sharing and rolling on loot. I'm just happy they might go back to actually making fist weapons again. Also, all classes share tokens, deal with it?<br />
4. Its a bit silly to bring up a lame spell like Mass Dispel. If your going for aoe type of effects, any one of the healers new aoe spells have great animations. On the dps side, spells are being updated and there's plenty of flash. If anything this game relies too much on particle effects but what can you do with a 7 year old game I suppose.</div></div><hr />

That stopped a long, long time ago. They implemented anti-virus scanning on their end before making files available and stopped allowing EXEs and that took care of it.<br />

Now picture a scenario even stranger...<br />
A family has two brothers. They grow up together, but the political turmoil in their hometown gets more and more heated as they reach adulthood. Each son chooses to fight for a cause they believe in, spending years apart in separate training and other battles... the horrors of war they each witness are tremendous, and their loathing for the opposite side in the war is unending. Finally the day of fate strikes - totally unknown to them - and they meet each other on the field of battle. Orders are orders, and one uniform is the same as another. Musket balls fire.<br />
Could this happen? Ask the friendly people in Gettysburg.<br />

<br />
This &quot;fighting against people who share your ancestry and upbringing&quot; scenario already exists in WoW, repeatedly: high elf vs. blood elf. Forsaken all used to be humans or high elves.<br />
<br />
The only difference is that pandaren aren't inherently hostile to one another, and that they don't have a giant cultural schism like the other examples. You need to stop viewing them in light of other races, they have a totally different mentality about war than the races we're already familiar with.</div></div><hr />

The example of Arminius, whose brother stayed with the Romans, is instructive here.<br />
<br />
What you are describing also undermines the underpinnings of the modern proposition nation. With such tribal loyalties how can citizens can be relied on?<br />

This happened a lot in a very important time called The Civil War. Families were split apart and often fought against each other then, so how is the notion of pandaren that come from the same lineage fighting each other any different?</div></div><hr />

1. I was focusing on the 'fun' part and wanted to remove the rest of the quote, but chose not to because I didn't want to be accused of somehow taking it out of context.<br />
<br />
2. You are right that it would require so much redesigning that they're not going to push it for Mists. That does not preclude them from changing their mind for the expansion after Mists.<br />
<br />
3. I'll always be worried about my gal's weapons. Who wouldn't when it comes to their main? ;) Same goes for tokens, except I am slightly more anxious due to the bad RNG my shaman has had for much of Cataclysm. I'm hoping that the changes Blizzard has planned for patch 4.3 (and onward) will prove helpful in this regard.<br />
<br />
4. I mentioned the spells that I did in my comment because they were what first came to my mind. (Light of Dawn is a point in your favor, I'll admit, though I still think Blizzard has been going too far in the direction of minimalism due to concerns about said flashiness.)</div></div><hr />

Yeah because taurens don't fight taurens. Orcs don't fight orcs. And the most obvious humans don't fight humans. Bloodhoof (actual leader tribe of the taurens) hate the grimtotem, who hate them even more.

Also, giving them a Gragas ulti would be epic beyond epic. Not too hyped about only using staves, but I can live with that; whereas not being a Brewmaster would stop me rerolling. :(<br />
<br />
Also, that Mylune cosplay was practically spot on. I mean, even her face looks the same as Mylunes. Big props there.</div></div><hr />

Ok, I'll bite.<br />
<br />
Monks are getting leather because, in my opinion, it makes more sense both from a story and game standpoint. Least disruption to gear and people won't be scratching their heads wondering, &quot;how does a monk deal with mail armor?&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Just as much class need mail than leather. Without considering that shaman/hunter are way more played than druid/rogue...<br />
Leather was the perfect choice.</div></div><hr />

They commented on this at Blizzcon. They didn't want to start dropping +agi/+str cloth so they just gave them leather. In reality most (if not all) monks wear cloth, and upgrading to leather can be pulled off lore-wise.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keile</div><div class="date">2011-10-29, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have one single remark on the whole &quot;choose your side&quot; idea - suppose you pick a pandaren from a community that lives on a giant turtle. This single pandaren can choose whether he supports the Warhchief or the Leaders of the Alliance. Now, imagine a battleground where each side has a plethora of pandaren warriors, monks, mages, etc... each of them share ancestry, culture and generally, something they once called home. If we explore this RP notion a tad more, wouldn't it be similar to brothers fighting against each other for a purpose dictated by someone else? I know this is an MMORPG and gameplay &gt; story but really, having to fight and kill your own is a bit... stupid? Yes, we have killed a lot ill minded brethren that have been seduced by the dark forces, but those are NPC's, not &quot;real&quot; players... Think about it.<br />
<br />
Blizzard already discussed this.<br />
<br />
Pandaren meeting Pandaren of the other faction are more like &quot;What's up? I see you are with the other faction than me. Let us Kung Fu fight. Should we both survive we shall then drink till we pass out!&quot;<br />
<br />
They are actually rather chill about the whole thing.</div></div><hr />

Exactly; leather is essentially nothing but glorified cloth (lol), so it works.<br />

<br />
Haha that made me smile. What im wondering about is if they heal throu punching and kicking that means they need to have an enemy to hit.. So what do you do when you have bosses who have air phases?</div></div><hr />

I would never wear a costume, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with the way these people are dressed. If it makes them happy and they aren't hurting anyone, then they aren't doing anything wrong.</div></div><hr />
