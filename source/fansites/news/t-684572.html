We wanted to address some of the confusion we often see regarding the Battle for Wintergrasp. We will not provide exact details on how the system works to try and avoid abuse of the mechanics, but there is a system in place that can change how the battle plays out.<br />
<br />
When one faction defends more than the other, the system will give advantages like the ability to use catapults or siege tanks faster to the faction that is on the offensive. On realms where one faction is often able to defend the fortress and the other faction rarely defends, the system tries to help this balance by providing bonuses to the faction that rarely succeeds at defending. <br />

No Strength DPS Ring @ Ashen Verdict<br />
The reason we haven't added one is actually a frustrating technical issue that prevents us from having more than 4 rewards on a quest like this. We do intend to fix this though and add a strength ring in the future, we just aren't sure this will be done for the Ashen Verdict line or if it will have to wait until the next time we use a system like this in a future patch.<br />
<br />
[...] There are a lot of restrictions on these rings and we don't expect players to understand how tricky some technical issues can be.<br />
<br />
We have done the four ring system in the past and while players may be a bit more selective about their stats these days, we don't want players to expect every source of loot to have perfect itemization for every class and every spec. There are other alternatives if you are unhappy with this option. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21726119617-ashen-verdicit-rep.html))<br />

Need Before Greed in Cross-Realms Dungeons: Trinkets<br />
There are some trinkets that are improperly classified in the Need Before Greed system. These are typically things that proc and the procs are hard to detect. We’re getting them fixed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/21971497641-priests-cannot-need-on-spark-of-life.html))<br />
<br />
Cataclysm PvP<br />
&quot;Bring the player&quot; refers to the way we shared more buffs and debuffs for PvE purposes so that building a raid isn't so restricted.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure there's ever going to be a way you can just grab random people and expect to accomplish much in a competitive Arena. Part of our focus on BGs in Cataclysm is to let players PvP without having to worry so much about their comp. We're not necessarily trying to encourage any player with interest to step into Arenas in the same way we are with raiding in LK. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21726119398-what-is-the-devs-vision-of-arena-pvp.html))<br />
<br />
PvP rewards in Cataclysm<br />
The answer is that we are changing the way we do that for Cataclysm and allow players to earn the same epic PvP gear for rated BGs. This does not mean you can grind your way through BGs. You'll have to win. It should feel roughly equivalent to those guilds capable of beating the most difficult encounters getting the best PvE gear. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21726119398-what-is-the-devs-vision-of-arena-pvp.html))<br />
<br />
Balancing classes for PvP<br />
We think one of the problems is that we've spent too much effort balancing around specific specs instead of teams. But it's actually the comp that is super important. In the past we've given a spec with presumably low survivability more survivability or a class with marginal CC better CC. Increasingly though, we think that's a shotgun approach. What we are doing now is looking in terms of a, typically 3-player, team. What does a Balance druid bring to the table? Why would you want a warlock instead of a Frost mage? Those types of questions. We want to make sure there is at least one viable comp for each spec and then we can adjust those specs by answering the question: Okay, why is A being brought more than B?<br />
<br />
The flip side of that is why you'd want to be spec A of your class when spec B is more attractive to the other players. Whenver you buff A, you risk B falling off though.<br />
<br />
Too often the forum discussions (and not just our forums) rally around very specific questions, such as: how do I beat this guy? Or, why do I get blown up so fast? Those can be useful at identifying weaknesses, but ultimately it's the synergy with the other players on the team that is more important. (I'm only talking about Arenas here. Coordination in BGs is still important. It's just very different.)<br />
<br />
P.S. Too often the forum discussions also focus too much on what the best players are capable of doing. Many players would get more information by looking at what the average Arena players are doing. The best players are where they are because they just really know what they're doing. PvP balance for them is going to be different than it is for the average player. (Not more or less important. Just different.) <br />

Everlasting Affliction<br />

Warlocks AOE Spells<br />
First thank you for posting, constructively. Our intent is for Seed of Corruption to be more attractive to Affliction, and Rain of Fire more attractive to Destruction. Before the flames begin, please note the word &quot;intent&quot;. We realize that is not always the case, depending on numerous variables.

Sweeping Strikes / Bladestorm<br />
We are working on a fix so that Sweeping Strikes can no longer trigger multiple times per second when used with Bladestorm. Each whirlwind caused by Bladestorm will only trigger one Sweeping Strike regardless of the number of targets in range - the current Whirlwind ability already works this way.<br />
<br />
The goal of Sweeping Strikes is to hit extra targets, not to do more damage to existing targets to burst them down quickly. We’ll evaluate Bladestorm again once this change has gone live to see if any further changes are needed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21723849642-clarification-on-sweeping-strikebladestorm.html))<br />
<br />
[...] Bladestorm should not be able to use Sweeping Strikes to transfer all that damage to a single target. As I said above, the purpose of Sweeping Strikes is to hit *additional* targets not just cause more damage to existing targets. I believe Whirlwind works with Sweeping Strikes correctly, so we'd like to get Bladestorm to work the same way.<br />
<br />
This change will then let us see if any of the concern about Bladestorm in PvP is founded or if it's not an issue without Sweeping Strikes inflating the damage.<br />
<br />
We don't think this will be a real nerf to PvE Arms warriors, but if it chills out their AE damage in those very specific situations where there are several closely grouped adds and Arms damage skyrockets, then I agree that's a good thing.

<br />
You're complaining about Death Knight viability in Arena? Have you even tried Retribution Paladin!? It's not even close how much control you have in arena. Your class is like a combination of a Warrior and a Mage. Hard attacks, and you have control/interrupts out the ass. You should be thankful of how viable you're class already is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If more than 4 quest rewards for the rings is a problem, why not have the vendors of your T10 give you the quest?<br />
<br />
Say you are a Warlock, the guy gives you the quest for Ashen Verdict friendly and the spell dps ring as a reward, and it continues so on.<br />
<br />
If you are a Warrior, the guy gives you the quest for friendly and what would hopefully be a choice of the Plate DPS Ring (str/crit), the Physical DPS Ring, and the Tank ring.<br />
<br />
If you are a Paladin the guy gives you the quest for friendly and a choice of the Plate DPS Ring, the Physical DPS Ring, the Tank Ring, and the Healing ring.<br />
<br />
No class is going to have a use for all 4 rings, even druids would only use the physcial dps, healing, spell damage, and tank one (possibly). I don't see why they didn't go about it that way if their interface is so &quot;frustratingly&quot; hard to manage.<br />
<br />
I just hope they add it in the future.<br />
<br />
It's not about people wanting &quot;perfect stats&quot; on their gear, but Plate DPS lose so much AP when we use Agi rings. They don't want us to use Mail/Leather because it's not made for us, but they want us to use a ring that's not made for us? Right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This won't change that at all.<br />
A druid has a use for caster-dps trinkets (aka moonkin) so they're allowed to roll on it. (I'm not debating whether the teddy had a right to roll on it, just mentioning he'll still be able to roll on it.)<br />
<br />
The problem as I understand it is:<br />
There is a caster dps trinket, but it's marked as physical dps. So a rogue could need said trinket and the poor mage can't. Just an issue with some items.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Their programmers must be pretty poor if they can't figure out how to add more than 4 quest rewards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course they can add more than 4 quest rewards. But this is quite a different case. There are dozens of conditions involved with upgradeable rings. If the current framework for quests doesn't support the coding needed to add a fifth ring, I can understand they're hesitant to change the entire code. You have to remember how many unintended actions can happen when you change something on a scale like this, every quest in WoW could potentially be affected.</div></div><hr />

Just add a second quest giver :<br />

One for casters : dps et healers<br />
One for physical : ap, str, tank<br />

2 different quest with less than 4 rewards. Problem solved...<br />

<br />
It's just that Blizzard become more and more lazy with the &quot;hardcore content&quot;. Casual don't care about the little loss between an ap or a str ring, they just want to shine with the ilvl. And that's just what Blizzard want : happy casual with minimum work.</div></div><hr />

Wintergrasp Information<br />
We wanted to address some of the confusion we often see regarding the Battle for Wintergrasp. We will not provide exact details on how the system works to try and avoid abuse of the mechanics, but there is a system in place that can change how the battle plays out.<br />
<br />
When one faction defends more than the other, the system will give advantages like the ability to use catapults or siege tanks faster to the faction that is on the offensive. On realms where one faction is often able to defend the fortress and the other faction rarely defends, the system tries to help this balance by providing bonuses to the faction that rarely succeeds at defending. <br />
<br />
<br />
Umm.....Um....At least change this for PvP servers? kinda defeats the purpose of the &quot;world PvP&quot; who said the alliance needs WG on tich?</div></div><hr />

The reason we haven't added one is actually a frustrating technical issue that prevents us from having more than 4 rewards on a quest like this.

[...] There are a lot of restrictions on these rings and we don't expect players to understand how tricky some technical issues can be.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can actually understand some of the probs their dealing with here, their dealing with alot of old code using some old specified templates which they don't wanna change since if they do it may end up affecting other quests throughout the game in some weird ways.<br />
<br />
This is the prob with complex programming techinques and trying to understand what someone else did before and why they did it.I guess that is why they need good programmers who can create effective and elaborate refrences for their work for others to follow, in their absence.</div></div><hr />

Ok so blizz has a quest that has the option to take one of four paths each path resulting in a different reward. Now the people QQ because not only do you have to put in an extra reward on the first quest you have to code to create the quest to have the fifth path added. Seeing how the game identifies what ring you have then gives you the next quest in chain means an entire new path to keep track of. <br />
<br />
Now you say put these on the vendors. Ok put them on the class vendors there now you have 10 people with the same problem or an entirely new problem of ok well this vendor only needs 1 ring while this one needs 4. So all you've done is create a bigger problem.</div></div><hr />

No one should be complaining about healers and tanks needing DPS gear. You should be grateful we are willing to come in our offspec to come and tank and/or heal for you.

You obviously don't realize that those quest rewards are different, the rings are in a path system. The developer who coded the original path system is, like said before, probably working on something els, and they can't implement a fifth path without having something bug out.<br />

I wonder if this includes being ported to your own graveyard, which your faction controls, yet has the other faction's spirit healer instead... so you can't rezz. Or being in your graveyard when control changes and it not automatically porting you to the next closest one you still control. &gt;:(<br />
<br />
Dying and sitting in a graveyard with a dwarf spirit healer mocking you for the rest of the battle is not fun. &gt;:(</div></div><hr />

http://db.mmo-champion.com/f/1145/ - Must be a buff that the QQ kiddies get.<br />
<br />
It's neat that they'd elaborate a bit on how debuffs/buffs/equalising things like WG works, and it's extra hilarious they won't go into detail, or else people might figure out a way to manipulate the numbers (everyone joins a 50v50 WG, 40 of horde leaves, the remaining 10 have vehicles and IWIN buttons)<br />
<br />
I for one look forward to them revamping the 4/4 upgraded ring system in time for me actually have a STR based character to get it ;) besides, when Blizzard find things like this that they pour some time into to fix, it winds up becoming 1000x better than the QQ kids could have ever imagined.<br />
<br />
It is moderately entertaining that they won't fix the problem with the code :)<br />
<br />
I can imagine (as many people pointed out before) that they're probably simply recycling code.. whether or not it's a function or straight copy/paste.. one would figure that they'd be able to modify the code if it were copy/paste, however they'd be able to reproduce the function as DoRingQuest(); to DoRingQuestMoarRingz(); ..<br />
<br />
Either way.. I am loving the new patches and speed of releasing that blizz is doing.. <br />
<br />
and I'm not sure how having the quest given by the t10 vendor would be any different.. it's still a quest that's given by a NPC?<br />
<br />
I'd have the guy who hands you the ring give you a token when you hit friendly.<br />
<br />
You take that token to t10 (or the JC in Dalaran) and trade it in for a ring. Then do the ring upgrades like the Kirin-Tor rings in Dalaran (T1 Ring + New Rep for T2 Ring) etc.</div></div><hr />

This isn't a casual/hardcore discussion either, this is a raid rep and either give everyone who gains rep the same option for rewards or don't give any at all. <br />

[...] There are a lot of restrictions on these rings and we don't expect players to understand how tricky some technical issues can be.<br />

We have done the four ring system in the past and while players may be a bit more selective about their stats these days, we don't want players to expect every source of loot to have perfect itemization for every class and every spec. There are other alternatives if you are unhappy with this option. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21726119617-ashen-verdicit-rep.html))<br />
<br />
There would be such an easy solution for the Problem ...<br />
Just Remove [Ashen Band of Endless Destruction] (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50398/ashen-band-of-endless-destruction/) &amp; [Ashen Band of Endless Wisdom] (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50400/ashen-band-of-endless-wisdom/).<br />
In exchange Add a Ring like <br />
<br />
<br />
Ashen Band of Endless Fail<br />
+73 Stamina<br />
+73 Intellect<br />
Yellow Socket<br />
Socket Bonus: +5 Spell Power<br />
Equip: Increases spell power by 101.<br />
Equip: Improves critical strike rating by 51.<br />
Equip: Improves haste rating by 59.<br />
Your spells have a chance to increase your spell power by 285 for 10 sec.<br />
<br />
and [Ashen Band of Endless Vengeance] (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50402/ashen-band-of-endless-vengeance/) just in a Strength Version ...<br />

[...] There are a lot of restrictions on these rings and we don't expect players to understand how tricky some technical issues can be.<br />
<br />
We have done the four ring system in the past and while players may be a bit more selective about their stats these days, we don't want players to expect every source of loot to have perfect itemization for every class and every spec. There are other alternatives if you are unhappy with this option. (Source)<br />

Quite possibly one of the most lazy things I have ever seen, and one of the most insulting posts to our intelligence as a player base not even bothering to explain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know there are plenty of quests that offer more that 4 rewards for completion of the quest so this makes no sense. For my pally i'll pick up the tanking ring, but still, for dps classes they need some love too. If you're going to launch these rings then make them available for all.</div></div><hr />

why not make a similar system with the ring?<br />
add all possible rings, and keep the &quot;Ashen Verdict ring&quot; requirement on each ring so you cant buy 2+ :edit: (requires Rep levels to buy better rings)<br />
<br />
Blizz can be smart sometimes...</div></div><hr />

I am playing a fury warrior myself and im perfectly okey with the melee one except for the small amount of attack power which the proc makes up for plus the socket that is 20 extra strength.</div></div><hr />
