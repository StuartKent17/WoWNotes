I'll decide if i hate the new feature or not (Most often I do not). That is what i appreciate about this site the most and thats why i pay for it. Whatever you can do to preserve that uniqueness would be desirable for me. <br />
<br />
I recognize that sites like wowhead do and offer A LOT of content which attracts visitors (and thus money) but i find the cluttered layout almost unbearable to use.</div></div><hr />

I would definitely be interested in similar meat and potatoes coverage of other &quot;MMO&quot; style games like division 2 or STO or whatever. sometimes its impossible to figure out what is going on over there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tehdef</div><div class="date">2019-06-11, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Remove the off-topic discussion forums. Why? It's become highly polarized and clearly political, populated by what I feel is disingenuous parties. Commonly discussing topics in bad faith, providing clearly incorrect information, or posting in a manner that masks their true opinions. To be blunt, many of them dance around their racism, sexism, and general intolerance without calling a spade a spade. <br />
<br />
2. If you can't remove political discussion entirely, I would like to request a more formal stance against right-wing political posters, commonly found participating in threads that bait topics regarding sexism, racism, and other forms of general intolerance. <br />
<br />
I want to see these forums move more back towards the center with the extremist elements removed. It's very frustrating coming here to see the top 5 most recent posts all about politics on the main page, and the thread housing handfuls of extremists views. These threads often reach 40+ pages of idiots arguing with each other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is clearly a moderation issue, as I feel the mods are allowing these extreme elements and opinions to exist on their board, because of their own beliefs place their neutrality in jeopardy. I'm happy I wasn't the only one seeing this as an issue.</div></div><hr />

In any case, get more mods for off topic.<br />

<br />
Number 1 <br />
A option to toggle native dark mode having to use something like stylus / dark reader to give the site a dark theme works kinda but it tends to be buggy so it would be nice for it to be natively supported.<br />
<br />
Number 2<br />
Better use of wider screens on a 2560x1440p in a 16:9 monitor there are like 20cm of just empty space on each side of the screen.<br />
<br />
Number 3<br />
<br />
Put in a block that you cant create new forum threads on a fresh brand new account make it so it needs to be X amounts of days old and/or Y amount of posts before you can create a new thread to help prevent spam and random bait troll posts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vincink</div><div class="date">2019-06-11, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From a business point of view and a future web developer, I'm really curious what kind of expenses running a site like this incurs.Depends on how much one cares to invest in both maintenance and new feature development, as well as what kinds of features one wishes to provide. If it's just a glorified blog+forum cross-over with only a single caretaker, most of the cost is in paying for simple web hosting. If it's data-centric applications, like wow-head, the cost also includes cloud-based infrastructure, hosting, and deployment systems. <br />
<br />
Developers run about USD$65,000 a year on average; experienced and senior developers are closer to USD$100,000. (This is average salary, higher in cities with over a million people, even higher in San Francisco, New York, London, Vancouver, etc) Once you start staffing, a majority of your costs are people. People cost a lot of money. And I mean, a lot.</div></div><hr />

MMO-C is one of the few fairly active traditional forum communities left on the internet and I'd hate to see them move this in the direction of social media.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thage</div><div class="date">2019-06-11, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few genuine suggestions:<br />
<br />
1) Dark theme. Seconding this.<br />
<br />
2) More active moderation in Off-Topic. Not specifically against ideologies, but more proactivity in redirecting political threads to the Politics subforum and stricter lines drawn in trolling/flaming would be a good start toward saving O-T from the cesspool of screeching chimpanzees that have overrun it and made it no better than /pol/.<br />
<br />
3) More stringent policies as to what ad services you pursue. Autoplaying ads and forced redirects to malware sites that blare loud, robotic voices telling you to download their malware-ridden &quot;virus scanner&quot; or call some scam line so they can fix your Windows (which require you to stop scripts in your browser window and quickly fill up your history before you can close the tab) are why I wager many, if not most site users run adblockers on this site, which I'm sure impacts the site income and makes it more difficult to monetize. Site administration should visit the site semiregularly off their admin account and with adblocks disabled to ensure ad providers aren't cramming redirects and other means of attempting to infect users' computers, tablets, and phones with malware.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dunkl</div><div class="date">2019-06-11, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the simple layout. No-clutter, no-opinion, no gimmicky features or unnecessary bloat. <br />
<br />
Just the latest news and the comments / insights of posters. <br />
<br />
Anything more than that both visually and structurally and I don't think I'd like it much. Wowhead is too busy on the eyes and ff14's sites are aggravating to navigate. <br />
<br />
I guess I like and appreciate simple, clean, no-nonsense layout and usability.<br />

<br />
3) More stringent policies as to what ad services you pursue. Autoplaying ads and forced redirects to malware sites that blare loud, robotic voices telling you to download their malware-ridden &quot;virus scanner&quot; or call some scam line so they can fix your Windows (which require you to stop scripts in your browser window and quickly fill up your history before you can close the tab) are why I wager many, if not most site users run adblockers on this site, which I'm sure impacts the site income and makes it more difficult to monetize. Site administration should visit the site semiregularly off their admin account and with adblocks disabled to ensure ad providers aren't cramming redirects and other means of attempting to infect users' computers, tablets, and phones with malware.<br />
<br />
<br />
So much this. I used to visit rather regularly on my phone, throughout the day, until this started happening every single time. If they could get a handle on this I would gladly visit more often and recommend this site to newer players that need straight forward information. since this site can be less overwhelming than wowhead.</div></div><hr />

I agree, just perma ban anyone who mentions 1 political thing, then create mmo-politics, tell everyone who wants to talk about that stuff to go there, then abandon it no mods no nothing just leave the people there to rot.<br />
<br />
edit: no-one can tell me to avoid politics i have that section turned off, but it seeps into every off-topic thread and even WoW threads.</div></div><hr />

1. Agree<br />
2. Disagree. If this site becomes a bunch of stuff about games that I don't care about, then I'll just leave and not come back. Other MMO's are flashes in the pot. The best arguement you can make is for Final Fantasy, but what's the point? <br />
<br />
If MMO C doesn't try to compete with other game sites offering information, then they won't be visited. Why would you want to turn a site that specializes in WoW, and then turn it on other games? So WoW gets lets attention and the main purpose of the core visitors leave because the content is worse? <br />
<br />
Nah, I'll pass.<br />

Wasn't really talking about forums. Just news and info generally. It's a strong point of the site. The all-the-eggs-are-in-one basket approach is fine since Blizzard has a very large basket but there's a lot more going on in the gaming world than just Blizzard and diversifying a bit would be in sync with the way the site is named. The News section is what originally brought me to the site and it's still the one thing I read pretty carefully every time a new post is put up.</div></div><hr />

Yeah honestly - if this is another suggestion thread then you need to completely clean out your moderators. They don't enforce site wide rules on everyone. Just on a per-person basis. Depending on whether you've offended their views or beliefs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are we going to do anything about the far-right paid posters?<br />
<br />
<br />
The amount of people asking to get new mods and close the off-topic forums gives me a bit of hope that I wasn't the only one sick of seeing the non-sense posted there. <br />
<br />
This is clearly a moderation issue, as I feel the mods are allowing these extreme elements and opinions to exist on their board, because of their own beliefs place their neutrality in jeopardy. I'm happy I wasn't the only one seeing this as an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suggestions?<br />
<br />
Get rid of the damn trolls. We have so many bad-faith shitposters in here...<br />
<br />
<br />
Make Off-topic threads not show on the front page, would be a good start.<br />
<br />
I suggest you start using the filters or the ignore user function to stop seeing the recent thread activities being clogged up by the usual suspects that you've got a problem with. Try it sometime, it's refreshing to see your actions make a difference to your own user-experience. A lot of people use the forum and many only to vent without looking to debate their opinion. You don't have to bother with them if you don't want to, others can and will, they're often without principle and easily put in place/told off when wrong.</div></div><hr />

For most of the boards its between 50 and 100 posts in 90 days which only a few posts a week. Lower traffic boards have much lower requirements. It's basically just the bare minimum for us to judge people by and make sure they are quality posters before bringing them on the team.<br />
<br />
That said, although moderating doesn't necessarily need to take a lot of time, if one doesn't have a time to make a few posts every few days, they probably don't have enough time to moderate.

MMOC was sold to MLG then to Curse then Twitch then Fandom and now Magic Find. The site has changed very little through those acquisitions because despite different parent companies the people actually running the site have stayed largely consistent.<br />

Magic Find is good news for MMOC in the long run but it's probably not going to change the day to day for users very much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's clarify this is satire of a few earlier posts, in case it's not clear. No, i don't want anything done to the accounts and posts of people i haven't met,what they think it's their own business :/ Just funny that the first thing that some wanted to ask is if we can get rid of stuff they hate.<br />
<br />
Good luck with the site and the acquisition.<br />
<br />
First off just want to say I very heartened to see that BB is involved in some capacity and agree MMO-Champion should provide more coverage of other games.<br />
<br />
But to your point, some of the stuff I see on the off-topic forum (and I only rarely peruse it) is some of the most racist, strident, vile and wholly inaccurate misleading stuff. I have seen very few intelligent and informed debates take place in these threads. Some of it is also likely the product of foreign and/or professional trolls actively trying to stir things up. In this day and age ALL technology companies or site owners should have the obligation to weed out such content (and, to be fair, it's not all right wing nuts).<br />
<br />
The task of policing the site is monumental for a small company like Magic Find. The easiest solution, since it would apply equally to the trolls / left wing Marxists and right wing nut jobs is to eliminate the off-topic section altogether. There are more than enough other outlets for this form of expression besides a gaming site. And, personally, if I owned the site I would sleep better knowing I didn't contribute to the toxicity of public discourse and/or made a few extra dollars a year because I was an outlet for such vile content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To answer this point directly, it's been directly addressed with the moderating team on many occasins, by many posters. That's a moderation discussion so I won't get into details on it. But I will put it simply like this: at fault is the forum moderation philosophy.<br />
<br />
Part of the problem I think is the technology behind the site. It runs on vBulletin 4 which first came out in 2009. Guild websites run on more advanced software than vBulletin 4. Newer forum software has ways to block the spam accounts they have to manually clean up in addition to blocking banned Russian trolls. A technology upgrade would go a long way.<br />
<br />
I hope the new owners will prove to be an opportunity to revamp the moderation approach and revamp the forum and bring them both to modern levels.</div></div><hr />

Seeing how this site started off as a WoW fansite, I don't see why you would be upset that most of their focus is on the game/company that made them who they are in the gaming information industry. Other games do have mega threads or subsections devoted to them. I would personally like to see OTHER games get their own subsection too not just the ones that there currently are.

They have little to no coverage by MMO-C itself, so activity in those subforums is pretty low too. Though even FFXIV section has more activity than HotS and Overwatch that have their own main pages, which yet again is confusing as to why do they even bother covering them.</div></div><hr />

MMO-Champ is an excellent source of WoW news, but when Hearthstone and HotS gets more coverage than non-Blizzard MMOs, that's just embarrassing.<br />

<br />
<br />
Can we shut down the off topic forums that became personal blog posts of a few weirdos over the years now?<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Remove the off-topic discussion forums. Why? It's become highly polarized and clearly political, populated by what I feel is disingenuous parties. Commonly discussing topics in bad faith, providing clearly incorrect information, or posting in a manner that masks their true opinions. To be blunt, many of them dance around their racism, sexism, and general intolerance without calling a spade a spade. <br />
<br />
2. If you can't remove political discussion entirely, I would like to request a more formal stance against right-wing political posters, commonly found participating in threads that bait topics regarding sexism, racism, and other forms of general intolerance. <br />
<br />
I want to see these forums move more back towards the center with the extremist elements removed. It's very frustrating coming here to see the top 5 most recent posts all about politics on the main page, and the thread housing handfuls of extremists views. These threads often reach 40+ pages of idiots arguing with each other.<br />
<br />
<br />
As I read this thread, the question I keep having regarding most of the complaints:<br />
People actually spend time on the Off-Topic Forum? :confused:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
MMO-C has been running for long enough that while many of its users have lost interest in WoW, they're still ingrained enough to come back to talk about other things on the other forums. Most of my friends here aren't even subbed to WoW anymore; they come to post on the FFXIV subforum, the video games subforum, cinema, fun stuff, chat zone, and so on. That's what's keeping MMO-C alive. If you begin removing those forums, you're going to be cutting off people's last interest in this site. Those channels needs to be grown, not restricting or shut down.<br />
<br />
<br />
#1 DONT change a working system<br />
<br />
^<br />
<br />
Need to focus on the reasons why people still come here.<br />
<br />
<br />
From a business point of view and a future web developer, I'm really curious what kind of expenses running a site like this incurs.<br />
<br />
Given the prevalence of adblock, I'm guessing it'd probably be a pretty big net negative on one's pockets.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is three things i can think of that would like to see <br />
<br />
Number 1 <br />
A option to toggle native dark mode having to use something like stylus / dark reader to give the site a dark theme works kinda but it tends to be buggy so it would be nice for it to be natively supported.<br />
<br />
Number 2<br />
Better use of wider screens on a 2560x1440p in a 16:9 monitor there are like 20cm of just empty space on each side of the screen.<br />
<br />
Seconded.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Would like to see the site get back to mostly be about gaming.<br />
2. Would like to see the site expand coverage to more than Blizzard.<br />
<br />
The gaming subforum could use some work. It's just &quot;video games discussion&quot; and forums for individual games.<br />
<br />
Don't close any of the subforums for those individual games, but I think we could have subforums for &quot;video game development&quot; or &quot;Nintendo Discussion&quot; and such. Obviously they need to be a few choice picks so that we aren't spread out over too many subforums.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Agree<br />
2. Disagree. If this site becomes a bunch of stuff about games that I don't care about, then I'll just leave and not come back. Other MMO's are flashes in the pot. The best arguement you can make is for Final Fantasy, but what's the point? <br />
<br />
If MMO C doesn't try to compete with other game sites offering information, then they won't be visited. Why would you want to turn a site that specializes in WoW, and then turn it on other games? So WoW gets lets attention and the main purpose of the core visitors leave because the content is worse? <br />
<br />
Nah, I'll pass.<br />
<br />
I'd be down for the front page having a weekly news update that posts general information such as new major announcements and releases, could expand from there depending on what people want to see such as game development.<br />
<br />
<br />
I suggest you start using the filters or the ignore user function to stop seeing the recent thread activities being clogged up by the usual suspects that you've got a problem with. Try it sometime, it's refreshing to see your actions make a difference to your own user-experience. A lot of people use the forum and many only to vent without looking to debate their opinion. You don't have to bother with them if you don't want to, others can and will, they're often without principle and easily put in place/told off when wrong.<br />
<br />
This. If you don't want to interact with certain elements of the community, you don't have to interact with them.<br />
<br />
<br />
I imagine a full re-design of the website will occur. Mobile friendly and all that.<br />
<br />
I like the general look of the site but it could indeed be changed to look nicer on mobile (those advertisements...) and better on higher resolution monitors.<br />
<br />
<br />
The site, and all WoW sites really, are struggling to keep constant news posts with just WoW in mind. I'd suggest branching out to other MMOs like the community itself has. <br />
Off topic is just not working. We have a laundry list of banned topics because half the posters cannot possibly behave and the other half cannot really be moderated properly without a lot more work than you can find suitable mods for. Kill it. <br />
Instead branch out video games further (maybe kill the dead subforums and replace them with genres?) so we don't have to backtrack a page or two to see if a topic about a game already exists. Perhaps add more megathreads for fun topics; e.g. I've noticed food threads always get some activity and we could definitely have more threads about anime that are less hardcore than the thighs one.<br />

The problem is MMO-Champion doesn't really offer that much. It has news and usually does the data mining pretty well. But it never caught on for things other then the forums. WoWhead for example has really done a good job of branching out to different aspects. Though they will always have the database going for them.

<br />
Honestly I don't think MMO-Champion does well in datamining in the NEWS section. It does excellent in the megathreads themselves but when we are talking beta or ptr builds, WoWhead just does a far better job and understandably so since they clearly have far more resources available than MMOC does. But WoWHead over the past three years has been so focused on having multiple articles up per day that they keep having duplicate topics.</div></div><hr />

I'm convinced that people are being paid to say this, by Chinese spies.<br />
<br />
I know you’re joking to an extent, but the reality is WoW just isn’t enough to talk about on its own anymore. Other websites dedicated to WoW have started talking about other games now and even the 3 WoW podcasts I listen to have branched out to at least coverage of other Blizzard titles if not discussing things by completely different developers. <br />
<br />
I’d just like to see similar from MMO-Champion too. I don’t have any interest in Elder Scrolls myself, but I’m sure there are people on this side who do. I just want to see more news stories on the site.</div></div><hr />

Okay, so it would report news about WoW and final Fantasy, and it would do Final Fantasy poorly, so you'd be better off going to other sites. Other MMO's don't stick around for your request to even be entertained. It would be wasted resources, because they die within 6 months.<br />

I suggest you start using the filters or the ignore user function to stop seeing the recent thread activities being clogged up by the usual suspects that you've got a problem with. Try it sometime, it's refreshing to see your actions make a difference to your own user-experience. A lot of people use the forum and many only to vent without looking to debate their opinion. You don't have to bother with them if you don't want to, others can and will, they're often without principle and easily put in place/told off when wrong.<br />
<br />
I love how you took the time to quote out plenty of posts requesting better moderation and the removal of bad faith posters, and instead tell us to filter things out so these threads can still exist, so the right-wing nationalism that has populated this forum can live on. <br />

1The best arguement you can make is for Final Fantasy, but what's the point? <br />
To be fair, there's really no centralized news hub for FFXIV. You have several YouTubers (like Work to Game, Meoni, Speakers Network, MrHappy, and a few others) but they're pretty decentralized, making it difficult to amass news. The FFXIV subreddit is great but, by nature, isn't just a news aggregate and it can be iffy finding news among the other posts. Massively and other MMO news aggregates focus on multiple MMOs, and their search system is clunky at best.<br />
<br />
A 'tab' in MMO-C for FFXIV news would actually be extremely helpful in that regard.</div></div><hr />

If it is then I'm glad to see it saved, I'd rather not go to Reddit of the official forums.<br />
<br />
I do think that this forum could use some changes and improvements. For one I'd like to see them do more news about other MMORPG's. 10 years ago I woudln't have liked this because the game was still blooming with 12 million subs and any other game trying to compete went down fast. But now its a different time where there are a lot of good alternatives (ESO, Guild Wars 2 etc.) and WoW lost so many people that it might not even be the king of its genre by now. It will be very refreshing to see them branche out.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to see a huge clean up from game subforums that are dead (basically Minecraft and DotA 2) and maybe replace them with ESO and other active MMORPG's. And maybe give WC3 its own subforum now that WC3:R is on its way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So it went from 275 players to 282? Let's be real, Albion Online is small potatoes and not worth the time to report on the goings on. Same goes with GW2 if we're being honest. There hasn't been a post in that subforum in over 4 days. Eve is what, still a fairly minor player. There is a Runescape thread somewhere in the video game section, I don't think it sees that much action either. <br />
<br />
If anything the Video game section needs some sections removed for games like Rift, GW2, Dota2, Minecraft and so on. Most of those sub forums are quite useless now.</div></div><hr />

Okay reddit may have more people sure but there still aren't enough players in OSRS to have more than a subforum at best. I could see FFXIV being one game that gets picked to have some front page news for sure. Not much else besides that.</div></div><hr />

I kinda thought the same thing. There seems to be a lot of disdain for that section. <br />
<br />
I'm on the fence about whether this site should remain WoW focused or start covering other MMOs. It probably should at least offer a weekly headline section to share the biggest MMO news across the most popular ones if for no other reason than to maybe help people discover a new game that they might like and not otherwise have gone looking for.</div></div><hr />

It's an ownership group that includes Boubouille, you know, the guy that started MMO-Champion back in the day. And the day to day runnings are lead by people who were either already involved in running the sites or by new people who want to make these sites the best sites they can be and give them active care and attention again.<br />

The High Elf thread is a perfect example. Whoever moderates that thread is clearly biased to the pro-High Elf community, and hands out infractions to any one in opposition all while letting the &quot;pro-crowd&quot; break rules left and right without warnings. Situations like that prevent me from wanting to discuss things in certain threads, and as others have stated, puts MMO-C in a bad light.<br />
<br />
Just a small example of how I'd like to see this site changed. Moderation should be unbiased, especially since this site accepts money from its users.</div></div><hr />

Why would covering another game sporadically draw in crowds of people to this site? There are sub-forums for a few games but those communities never grew. Even with occasional mention of those games when they were &quot;new and fresh&quot;. Those communities did not grow here. And of course Reddit and Discord have more people logged in.

PS: Turned off the ad block to see and honestly, it's not too bad. I'm a little surprised. <br />

Other websites dedicated to WoW have started talking about other games now and even the 3 WoW podcasts I listen to have branched out to at least coverage of other Blizzard titles if not discussing things by completely different developers. <br />
<br />
I’d just like to see similar from MMO-Champion too. I don’t have any interest in Elder Scrolls myself, but I’m sure there are people on this side who do. I just want to see more news stories on the site.<br />
<br />
As of now, big news from other blizzard games appear on the front page, as links to other sites dedicated to those games, and that's plenty in my opinion. &quot;WoW just isn't enough to talk about anymore&quot; is a laughable statement, because it's just as much to talk about as it ever was, and there are other places to talk about other games.<br />
<br />
If you want more content on the site, that's okay, say that. There's plenty more that could clutter the front page without discussing other games. They could post a detailed walkthrough of every quest added to the game, with commentary. Every model, every texture or sound or background music file, every lore tidbit and grammar mistake could be discussed in full, because someone already spent hours of their life creating it. Or they could stick with what they're doing and let the WoW forum on MMO-Champion decide for themselves what to discuss, along with forums for other games, and only post the most major news for WoW.</div></div><hr />

The amount of times I've seen someone randomly start talking about Racism or Sexism or something to do with Trump in some random game thread is staggering.

Getting rid of the politic OT would go even further. Too many mods have agendas and bias. Rules are not enforced evenly. I have seen posters get banned for being racist, while others go on antisemitic rants that last for pages. A poster will get banned for telling someone to shut up, while another goes on a tangent that includes violent threats and nothing happens. Then you have Mods who tolerate nation bashing, Posts bashing the USA, but if you dare say anything negative about the EU, Banned. Same with religion. Its ok to Bash Christians, but say one word about the religion that shal not be named, Boom, you are banned . So just get rid of GEn OT and stick to Video games, pop culture and entertainment/hobbies</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's not just that, it's that even if someone like that posts about the game, the attitude tends to seep through because it's the same person. End of the day, there's no reason to have a politics or off topic forum here. People can go to reddit etc if they want that. Focus tends to equal success.</div></div><hr />

It contains almost twice as many posts as the WoW class forums, almost three times as many as the video games section, and almost as many as WoW general discussion. Bottom line = people like it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A genuine dark toggle would be nice.<br />
.<br />
Please keep the focus on WoW. That's what I come to this website for.<br />
.<br />
I miss the days when MMO-C offered comprehensive data-mining news more often. Anymore it's mainly number changes, which I don't have anything against... but it holds very little interest for me. It seems things like NPC dialogue (when a build includes it) has been ceded to the unsightly and bloated Wowhead.<br />
.<br />
Anything on the WoWDB front? It's much more of a community problem in terms of usage, but being developmentally dead in the water sure doesn't help. (Or should I abandon all hope on this.)<br />
<br />

<br />
Find a way to connect your databases with Wowhead, there's no reason why you can't be friends.<br />
<br />
Also, bring Chaud back.<br />
MMO-C tried to during the early years of this decade, but ZAM rebuffed them. I have little reason to believe that ZAM/Fanbyte's attitude has changed since on the matter.</div></div><hr />

Why is it a bad thing though? You use plenty of things with out knowing much of anything about it.</div></div><hr />

We’re excited to welcome MMO-Champion to the Magic Find family and are excited to work together! We're a small independent team of people who worked on gaming websites in the past (including MMO-Champion) and are teaming up to build up new communities together.<br />
<br />
Over the next few months we will do our best to ramp up work on the website and work together with all of you to improve performance and work on developing new ideas. <br />
<br />
Acquisitions are always a bit strange and come with a lot of questions, so we'll do our best to answer them and we hope we’ll build trust over time and improve MMO-Champion together. <br />
<br />
If you have any suggestions or issues you’ve identified on the website, now is definitely a great time to let us know about them!<br />
<br />
Strip the mod Thwart of their mod status. It is the single most obvious case of moderator having their own biases and abusing their mod powers.</div></div><hr />

Stop trying to be devils advocate. THESE PEOPLE make money of you, yes YOU, you deserve to know where your cookies and data is stored at. <br />
<br />
If I come to your house, left something in your door, told you not to worry about it, while I also said I will earn money on it, would you be OK with that?<br />
<br />
(I just described how the internet works...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Current ones are power-tripping egomaniacs. Pushing their own insane SJW agendas, and censoring most if not all dissenting opinions and point of views.<br />
<br />
Also, some of the rules on these forums are really weird. Spamming blatant troll &amp; bait threads are allowed, the creators actively protected by the mods. But calling someone out on it gets you warned.</div></div><hr />

So you know every little bit of information about your ISP? Your cell phone company? Facebook? Your grocery store? Your gas station? Your bank? Your credit card company? You are clearly on the internet so this magical mythical privacy thing isn't that big of a deal. I am sure you visit dozens of websites a week that you don't know one shred about their parent companies.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danner</div><div class="date">2019-06-16, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The forte of this site is undeniably the daily wow news on the front page. That service is fantastic, and what drew me in. No matter what, keep that wonderful service up. It's the heart of the site. <br />
<br />
The second best part of this site is the forums. I spent many years on the priest forum, it was a very good learning experience being able to see what other priests thought about various matters. Nowadays, I spend my spare time on the mafia games in the fun stuff section, and I love playing with those guys. Insert shameless plug for players who want to join here, etc. <br />
<br />
The site also has serious problems. The forums have been labelled as a cesspit by many, and I concur in principle. Especially the gen/ot and politics subsections. There are good topics there, and there are plenty of good posters with insightful reads I would not want to be without having read - but - the signal to noise ratio is low, and the noise is ugly. This is a moderation philosophy issue, since the noise typically stays within bounds of being banned, while still being plenty disruptive. In my opinion, there are parts of the forums a reader cannot enter with an mind of debate, as they are almost exclusively filled with trolls and POW warriors ruining any attempt at debate. <br />
<br />
I personally believe the topics of US governance politics and gender wars are especially bad, and would either want to see far more draconian moderation, or a purge of those topics altogether like the the subject of religion, which the mod team enforces heavily. But I guess that is a finding in dispute, and I also believe there are some issues raised regarding whether heavier moderation would be perceived as fair, especially as current moderation isn't perceived as such. <br />
<br />
On the technical side, I lament that I do not trust to browse this site without an ad-block. Last time I checked, this site used more user tracking services than I could account, and while I do not know if that has changed - I also do not trust you enough to to not put it back if that is no longer the case. I realize a site needs to make money somehow, and ads is a necessary evil - but MMO-champion has historically pushed that so far over the edge that it will take something extraordinary to happen for me to unblock the site from my adblocker. That this policy of mine has saved me from actual malware served on the site on two occasions doesn't help this case one bit.</div></div><hr />
