US and EU Maintenance Saturday<br />
Another round of maintenance is coming, this time with some hardware upgrades that should allow significantly more players (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/533459856385392641) to play at once. This will be done by phasing all of Draenor like the Tanaan Jungle intro zone. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/us-en.png US Maintenance - Starts on Saturday, November 15, at 03:00 AM PST and lasts until 9:00 AM PST.<br />
http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/gb-en.png EU Maintenance - Starts on Saturday, November 15, at 04:00 AM GMT and lasts until 10:00 AM GMT.<br />
We obviously expected an increase in logins, and prepared for well above what we were expecting. The actual amount is far above even that. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/533400357754261505))<br />
<br />
<br />
Update 7:07 p.m. PST<br />
We’re making preparations for the Europe maintenance beginning in just an hour, and along with hardware upgrades we will be implementing some of the performance improvements we’ve been testing. One of these is a fairly large change to the way the game world is run by the servers—expanding the phasing tech used for the Tanaan intro experience to the entire continent of Draenor. This will allow us to run multiple copies of Draenor simultaneously, spreading out server population, while attempting to keep guilds and parties within the same copy. We’re currently running tests of this tech on a few North American realms, and have found we’re able to raise realm capacity by a significant amount. We’ll continue to provide updates as we progress through the Europe maintenance, and prepare to apply the same changes on the Americas and Oceanic realms.<br />
<br />
- - -<br />
<br />
Update 6:00 p.m. PST<br />
<br />
We’re continuing to work on improving realm and login stability, reducing Character Not Found errors, and hotfixing in-game issues. We’re making progress ahead of maintenance on a couple performance improvements, and we’re in the process of testing those improvements now on a few realms. Maintenance is beginning for our Europe realms in just a couple hours, and we’ll continue providing regular updates here throughout the night.<br />
<br />
Thank you again to everyone for your patience while we continue to work around the clock to address performance issues.<br />
<br />
- - -<br />
<br />
Last night we scheduled maintenance for Europe to implement server changes to help improve realm performance, and scheduled the same for the Americas/Oceanic realms today. With the maintenance in EU we experimented with raising population caps, and we’re continuing to make adjustments up and down to ensure a smoother game experience. Today we’re continuing to hotfix in-game issues, address any login and authentication issues occurring from the high number of players attempting to play, and make any changes and adjustments we can while the game is live. While these changes have made a marked improvement for the in-game experience, we still have a lot of work ahead of us.<br />
<br />
As most of you are aware, the demand on the game is extremely high right now, leading to increased queue times on many realms. We’re also seeing some login errors as a result. This is compounded by us needing to temporarily lower the population caps on all realms to help assist in realm stability issues due to a number of in-game factors that are putting greater than normal strain on the game servers. For those in-game now we’re seeing fairly stable gameplay, but with some continued issues when phasing into the Garrison. Even with lowered population caps we’re not seeing performance where it needs to be.<br />
<br />
We've been working toward much larger and longer term service improvements, which we’ll be implementing with off-peak maintenance tonight. A large portion of this extended maintenance will be upgrades to server hardware to help cope with the increased demand we’re seeing. We’re optimistic that hardware upgrades as well as some additional fixes and changes will resolve the in-game issues primarily centered around accessing Garrisons. We’re also continuing to test and implement new performance improvements whenever and wherever possible.<br />
<br />
We appreciate your continued patience, and we’ll be providing updates here as work progresses. If you use Twitter, we recommend following @BlizzardCS and @Warcraft for updates as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Service Status and Communication<br />
I get that this has been a rocky launch and the servers are stressed, you need to take them down for a few hours to resolve some issues. That's fine, we all would rather the game be running all weekend at 100%.<br />
<br />
I just wish you would communicate with your fans/customers better than the robotic way you do now.<br />
We can only communicate about what we know to be true. We're doing what we can to communicate as quickly as we can on key issues with everyone, but there's a lot being done on this end that can't be communicated or communicated right away. As you can see by the hotfixes (Rygarius has been posting), we've been sharing those out as quickly as possible. Both Zaryhm and Bashiok (among others on the team) spent time getting more information on things out last night as well. We have people from multiple departments working around the clock to monitor issues and work on fixes including the CS team here on the forums and on Twitter. This is not anything new for us though. It's what we strive to do with every patch and expansion. <br />
<br />
It may seem robotic to you, but we want to also make sure that when we are communicating that we're as precise as possible in what we say and don't want to come across glib to those who may not understand how seriously we take resolving these issues with everyone. <br />
<br />
We're working and trying to communicate that work to you as we can, but our primary focus is resolving issues as quickly as possible. We are right with you in that we both want you to play and enjoy Draenor and we also want to be able to play and enjoy Draenor. These things are not mutually exclusive. We're on the same side here.<br />
<br />
You should always add two hours to your estimate. Then it looks better when you finish early.<br />
We've had that occur many times. Rarely do people come to the forums to talk about it... because they're playing at that point. <br />
<br />
Unknown on the population numbers yet being bumped up. Believe it or not, sometimes we do end up waiting to the last minute in the hope we don't have to extend maintenance, but try to inform people right away.<br />
<br />
Honest question here - are you given the discretion to answer questions by yourself (or anyone else on the team) or do you guys kind of post by committee to make sure the posting is crafted properly, without giving too much information out, or worse, implying information you absolutely aren't saying. Again, an honest, no sarcasm question into the mind of a CM and how you guys communicate.<br />
It depends on the situation. Delicate high level information gets a lot of oversight to make sure it's correct and appropriate to go out. Other things can be more off the cuff and we're trusted to know where that line is.<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Addon - Broker Garrison<br />
Today we are looking at another helpful addon, Broker Garrison (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/broker-garrison). This addon requires a DataBroker display like Bazooka (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/bazooka). It tracks garrison related things across all of your characters, making it easier to know when to check on alts:<br />
<br />
<br />
Track the status of missions, building and upgrade processes, work orders, garrison resource and apexis crystals, and more.<br />
Allows you to hide and mute Blizzard's notifications and replace them with custom toasts. You will have more control of the toasts with Toaster (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/toaster).<br />
Invasion support is on the todo list.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Addon - Breeze<br />
Another garrison releated addon worth mentioning is Breeze (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/breeze). The animations that play after a mission are fun a few times, but the novelty will eventually wear off and you will want to click through them faster. This addon gets rid of the small animation that plays before you can collect your loot. Unfortunately it doesn't completely bypass having to click through mission results yet!<br />

You don't need to petition. They have generally heaped generous amounts of game time on players after this sort of disruption happened in the past. Also, internet petitions are pretty useless.</div></div><hr />

Joined a 4000 strong queue, fell asleep around 11pm with around 800 left.<br />
<br />
Woke with the Disconnected window an hour ago, queued for 50 mins got in, at which point the game went down for another 6 hour maintenance.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the update though, I hope they can fix their problems this time.<br />
<br />
Also thanks for the addon advice, I downloaded both of them!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is far worse than anything I've experienced in the past, and i've been playing/subbed since the start of BC - and I can't recall these kinds of lockouts/queues to get on ever...<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been waiting for almost 6 hours to log in on my Oceanic realm.<br />
<br />
Utterly unacceptable.</div></div><hr />

i would rather have 4 hours maintenance every day then 4 hours stuck in garrison not be able to turn in quest thats part of main storyline...</div></div><hr />

The wait was about 6 hours or more. So I went to bed in time thinking Ill wake up at 5 to play early before my daughter wakes up. Now, I woke up 5:30 to find out there is maintenance. I'm not angry at all because I understand it, I just feel so sad I haven't really been able to play with my limited time in the evening that I have. Tomorrow another day I guess (or well, today technically)!</div></div><hr />

In my opinion there shouldn't be a problem in the first place when they've had a monthly fee for 10 years. Fifth expansion in the making and it is this hard to predict a total haywire like this? Even though it's only the second day I'm still losing motivation when a handful of people can advance and gain advantages over the others who are locked out. Where's the compensation?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would they try and blame DDOS attacks? Then they inform customers there blizzcon items are now available at the blizzard store while everyone just wants to play WoD.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I have lost a little respect for Blizzard after this launch. How can expansion launches go backwards after so many expansion releases?<br />
<br />
Blizzard: &quot;Ok all what we have learnt, today we are putting all that in the corner and we are going to shit on it and not worry about it&quot;.<br />

Yeah. Seems like the AFK system also needs to be fixed too. People just jump here and there, that's it, they stay online. The game should track decent gameplay. If not peeps get booted.</div></div><hr />

Playing the devils advocate here; Keep in mind, what you define as 'playable' in your post is how able YOU are to play. Alot of other players have experienced acceptable to good performance during peakhour gameplay and I'm PRETTY sure that was weighed into the decision. Generally people only complain when things are not working for them (Which makes sense) but my game has been working relatively fine overall except the &quot;World Server Down&quot; and &quot;Instance Not Found&quot; issues once in a while.<br />
<br />
They opted for a time when less people were playing (Although I would have been aswell, so I understand your frustrations!) to deploy the upgrade and it seems smarter to me when you look at the big picture.<br />
<br />
You were one of those who could not play during regular hours AND has lost the playing time you set aside for tonight and that's sad, I feel for you. But night time is very, very likely the right time to make the updates regardless. Even if it was your smart way to dodging the issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You obviously didn't play vanilla, or TBC, or WotLK. Vanilla was, more or less, unplayable for the first 6 months, and even after that there were still major issues that went on through to TBC. TBC launch was also horrible for the first month, but Blizzard was more prepared this time. WotLK was also a bit better, but with it's own issues, and Cata was even better. The only reason MoP was reasonably smooth was because Blizzard lost a lot of people in Cata, and even more in MoP, so they still had the architecture and expectations of WotLK; therefore, it turned into a good launch because they were prepared for 13M players, but instead only 9M turned up. This expansion is no different. Blizzard has been getting better and better, and it's all thanks to a mix of better tech, better hardware, and fewer players.<br />
<br />
It's not a Blizzard launch without crashes and disconnects every 10 minutes. This launch has been smoother than any other I've experienced from Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

If you think this is the smoothest launch...you have serious issues. Cata and MoP, hell even WotLK was smoother than this one.</div></div><hr />

I fully get your point, i play on a very high pop realm so its impossible to do anything after people start coming home from work/school.<br />
Working nights this week so i got home around 5-6 AM hoping to get something done while most are still sleeping. Bam - Server Shut Down, 2 days in a row. :p<br />
Joined party with a pal who plays on another server (a &quot;migrate free here-server&quot;) and that made it playable for a bit, but still, around an hour later<br />
that server was crawling to a halt. So FCM is not that appealing if the target servers are struggling almost as bad...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Means they'll do like Tanaan Jungle where they limited the amount of active people in your vicinity to a fluid number in an effort to reduce playerstacking and performance issues. <br />
<br />
Have you experienced the issue so far where mobs 15+ feet radius of you 'dissapear'? That's because there are SO many players to render the server cracks down and limits you. Then when you step anywhere the server has to constantly relay the info from that location and back to you meaning mobs/items take ages to load while thousands of players are already there and the server tries to phase them away so you can see what's going in.<br />
<br />
This won't happen, now, as phasing will limit the amount of input the server recieves from your location. It means the thousands of people will still be near you on a technical point of view but your performance won't hinder them as theirs won't hinder you. Instead you'll see 10-200 people near you to increase your performance and your FoV will not retract to prevent crashes. <br />
<br />
Trust me, unless you're specifically trying to find someone, not in a group with you, in a cluttered area without having their Battle.net info or being in guild with them; You won't notice anyone is phased outside of your FoV not retracting anymore and you can run smoothly and mobs/items spawn appropriately. It's win/win/win. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I believe it was always intended to play like this and Tanaan was a 'test' to see if it worked. Now they're rolling it out all over Draenor to increase performance and this is likely the wave of the future. A smart system that constantly determines how many players are near another player to make sure the game does not feel 'dead' if players are available to be put in the same phase but at the same time does not cause lag/DC's because a clusterfuck of people are trying to do the same thing all at once. <br />
<br />
THAT SAID!!!:<br />
<br />
While your concerns posted should be answered by the above post, it does raise other concerns. What if that system fails? Will the servers crash instantly? Will responsiveness drop again at critical moments? Will it cause errors for groups, B-net friends, guildmates where they cannot join together because of a flaw in the system? Will the system be exploited to get 'speed levelling' phases where someone can sit alone and do everything while others accidentally phase together through unintended grouping? Will quest reward/completions be hindered for groups because player A is accidentally phased away from player B?<br />
<br />
All things the devs need to make sure works. Tanaan seems flawless to me so far but I've only had limited experience with it. There's alot of &quot;What if's&quot; that remains to be seen but I'd advice we take those issues as they come up rather than speculate and overanalyze them before they occour.</div></div><hr />

I still have a 200 Minute Queue 1500 peeps in front of me.<br />
<br />
I haven't played for a day now. Yesterday I sat in the queue from 18.30 to 01.45. the queue went from 3.700 to 1200 in that time....<br />
<br />
I pay to PLAY. Do something!<br />
<br />
I recall playing Star Wars: The old Republic online.<br />
They had a system that whenever there were too many in one zone then that zone would split into 2-3-4-5 duplicates of that zone. <br />
That was like 4 years ago....<br />
<br />
<br />
Wouldn't that be an idea?<br />
<br />
<br />
----- Edit -----<br />
Half an hour later I'm 905 in queue and it flexes between 1000 and 2000 minutes</div></div><hr />

They have generally heaped generous amounts of game time on players after this sort of disruption happened in the past. Also, internet petitions are pretty useless.<br />
<br />
That's not true at all, they rarely give out compensation for downtime.<br />
<br />
It happened during the original launch as the game was basically unplayable for many for an entire week. 4 days of gametime was given in 2008, a day in 2009.<br />
<br />
2 days were given in 2007 for players on certain realms, 1 day for certain realms in 2006 also.<br />
<br />
So in 10 years, there been about 6 days for any subscriber, and around 10 days if you happened to be on certain realms or battlegroups.<br />
<br />
This is from memory anyway, so I might be missing a few days, either way they haven't &quot;heaped out generous amounts of time&quot;, rather they generally only compensate when the game is down for atleast 24 hours.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I'm not surprised by the downtime, it happens every launch.</div></div><hr />

That's because a lot of these types of problems happened in vanilla (they'd largely fixed queues by bc because they upgraded the servers), and during launch for bc. That was basically the last time they had a launch this problematic. And, yeah, they did give us free time once the issue was resolved.

Of course it will get ironed out eventually... Eventually people will say forget it and just stop trying to log in. Then, after enough people bail on the game, they will not need to worry about fixing anything cause the servers will return to how they were before and be fine.</div></div><hr />
