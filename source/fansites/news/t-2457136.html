Shhh, don't try using logic against hate, it's extremely ineffective.<br />

Funny how they had christmas sale for the past few years, and yet ppl will still bitch this year how it's somehow due to BfA being &quot;crap&quot; and blizzard trying &quot;another moneygrab&quot; :) <br />

Hard to be self-righteous when you buy a mount for 25 dollars but have no problem spending dozens upon dozens of hours farming the gold to buy the long boi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because I like to earn my rewards through play time. And microtransactions in a subscription game is bullcrap and I don't support it. I also don't buy the uber-inflated gold sink mounts on principle; the most expensive mount I purchased was the yak for 120k because the utility is unmatched.</div></div><hr />

Its really laughable. These items in the store costs them basically NOTHING. They are just there, if anyone want to buy them. But I guess they were selling so bad that they are baiting collectioners with &quot;they wont be available anymore, last chance!&quot; and some dumb people will swallow the bait and buy them.<br />
<br />
This is really low and I dont know what worse its telling: what they think about their p(l)ayers, or that there are dumb enough people to fall for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is all about money now. I don't care how cheap this is compared to combined price. This is all about squeezing money out of a half dead camel.<br />
<br />
ONLY REASON you would ever retire something virtual, is when marketing have told them to do so to sell it to people with the FoMo (Fear of Missing Out)<br />
<br />
Note: I bought EVERYTHING on sale (Mounts, Pets etc.) with WoW token converted to currency. So it worked on me :)</div></div><hr />

Yeah mine is listed at £23.70.<br />
<br />
Not anything I want in the bundle though.<br />
<br />
Although all store pets/mounts are 50% off atm.<br />
<br />
Might pick up the Warforged Nightmare at last with it being an actual decent price at £13.<br />
<br />
Also for anyone who cares if you fancy getting a cheap account wide 110 boost then BFA is like £23.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although I COMPLETELY disagree with this cashgrab, the bundle is actually dynamic and will shave the price based on how many of the items you already have, so if you're only missing like 2 things I would probably advise you to see how much your updated price is and jump on it.</div></div><hr />

I think I'm missing 2 mounts, 2 of the helms and 1 pet. So £23 isn't that bad for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just don't get who this is marketed too - people that already buy these will already have 1 or 2 or all of them.<br />
<br />
Also - retiring store mounts? Now that is weird.<br />

The Grinning Reaver/Argi bundle for me is £14. Yet I own the Reaver.<br />

Figure that one out. All I'd get out of the bundle is the pet and yet it's not a retroactive bundle.</div></div><hr />

Its really laughable. These items in the store costs them basically NOTHING. They are just there, if anyone want to buy them. But I guess they were selling so bad that they are baiting collectioners with &quot;they wont be available anymore, last chance!&quot; and some dumb people will swallow the bait and buy them.<br />
<br />
This is really low and I dont know what worse its telling: what they think about their p(l)ayers, or that there are dumb enough people to fall for it.<br />
<br />
Considerin they have this sell every year, you just blabberin bullshit, but you do you.</div></div><hr />

What amuses me about such attitude, is how with this action, literally NOTHING changes for vast majority of players who don't buy things from shop. And yet, people act like this is literally armageddon. You can still keep playing (or not), the way you were an hour ago. People who collect mounts/pets/whatever can now get them cheaper with the 50% off. <br />
<br />
Sure, the &quot;retiring&quot; is dumb and designed to trick people, but honestly, seeing how every single company in the world has been using this for years...If someone gets tricked, it's on them.</div></div><hr />

Swift Windsteed.<br />
Armored Bloodwing<br />
Moonkin Hatchling<br />
Crown of Eternal Winter<br />
Helm of Hungering Darkness<br />

<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with the store not being successful.<br />
<br />
Its a way to push additional sales to make up for the fact that Blizzard/Activision have shit the bed hard this year, with a mediocre WoW expac release and subscriber counts by all indications being at an all time low, and no other note worthy game release in the past two or so years.<br />
<br />
The Blizzcon Diablo flop has caused a huge drop in stock prices, and this is a way for them to try to recover some of that lost cash flow.</div></div><hr />

It's not something Blizzard has to pay to manufacture and then leave sitting on a shelf waiting to sell. There's nothing whatsoever preventing them from just leaving the items in the shop even if they are the weakest sellers.<br />
<br />
Because of that, some of the outrage seems justified to me. It's 100% a gimmick to make more money. Yes, businesses have done this kind of thing forever. Doesn't mean it isn't sleezy.</div></div><hr />

It's a cash grab. they have probably seen sales numbers diminish to the point where they can conclude a cash grab by making them limited time only would be worth ending the sales completely on those items.</div></div><hr />

This looks really desperate on Blizzard’s behalf. They’re trying to drive up numbers before the next quarter, so everything looks fine and dandy. Maybe if you guys actually came up with new ideas instead of copying last expansion with new models and art more people would be playing, or sucking the fun out of everything like making the Hivemind only useable with 4 friends you did the puzzle with, or taking away xp lock from 110s.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From where I'm sitting, people are what's wrong with games today. As someone who played some ACTUAL pay to win games before WoW...It's completely mind blowing to me how much hate there is in WoW on Item Shop, where we have nothing more than COSMETICS. Sure, the scarcity method is trashy, and I can understand why people are calling Blizzard out on it...But still, it's just cosmetics. <br />
<br />
I'd wager that vast majority of WoW players don't give much of a fuck about mounts/pets. And since those two are the only things in shop, those people aren't influenced by shop in any way, shape, or form. And yet, they get upset and complain. Why? To complain? Don't really see any other LOGICAL, RATIONAL reason.<br />
<br />
Lately with the fox mount, or now this, it seems to me like people are more upset about shop stuff (which, once again, doesn't affect them in the slightest), than actual, real gameplay stuff. Which is...interesting, to say the least.</div></div><hr />

That, your response, that right there is the reason they're &quot;retiring&quot; a digital item.

Not about the shop, but about the predatory practices and what it means for the future of Blizzard.<br />

This kind of puts the final nail in the coffin that Blizzard cares about their consumers; they just showed their full hand, and that hand is empty; they've transferred everything they had in it for the customers over to their other hand, the one for the stock holders. <br />
<br />
Something as simple as tossing these items together and smacking a &quot;limited time sale&quot; on them would have gone over a lot better than, &quot;We're going to take this totally digital item and stop selling it, maybe forever, so buy it now because if not you'll miss out!&quot;</div></div><hr />

On a serious note, wasn't the moonkin pet originally for some charity event?

Which is exactly why they are &quot;retiring&quot; them... to get people like you to buy them when they need money bad...<br />
<br />
Think about it... retire items that have very low sales... bundle them and make peopel feel liek tey will miss out if they don;t get them. Cover your butt with &quot;They may come back&quot; then bring them back in a year or two and it'sll be liek new releases all over again.<br />

So, the amount one pays is pased on what one already owns in the bundle. I thought, &quot;By Bwonsamdi's blue butt- that is a HUGE deal!&quot; but it is only $20 because I own most of the things already, though, for someone that has none of these things, it's certainly not a bad price. When I logged onto her account, her price is higher since she has none of these.

<br />
Didn't it already? Sorry, but you seem much more naive than the guy you quoted. All companies care about is money. Anyone believing they care about customers is deluding themselves. Blizzactivision is a company. They want to earn money, any way they can. I'm reasonably certain that both sides of the fence understand it, the people hating on this move in this thread, and the people &quot;defending&quot; it. The only difference between us, is that you're all using emotion, while we're using logic and reason. <br />
<br />
Emotionally, yes, it's a shitty move from blizzard, and yet :<br />
<br />
Logically, for the people who don't care about mounts - nothing changed. <br />
<br />
For people who wanted those mounts - yes, now they have &quot;limited&quot; time to buy them, if they don't want to wait who knows how long for them to return to shop, which they obviously will, and I'm fairly certain MOST people understand it. And yet, with the 50% off, cash grab or not, it's actually beneficial to buy whatever you want NOW. It's the same thing every year around Christmas, everyone who's been playing for longer than a year and pays attention should know that by now. Most people I know with cash shop mounts only bought them during Christmas, since it's cheaper.<br />
<br />
Sure, the mounts, the pets, probably transmogs too, will return. Most likely for the &quot;full&quot; price though. There's no downside, and only upsides, to buying them now. Once again, FOR PEOPLE WHO WANTED THEM ANYWAY.<br />
<br />
And finally, for people who never really cared about those mounts, but now will decide to buy them since &quot;they will no longer be avaialble&quot;, assuming of course such people exist...Those are the dumbest kind of people, and they deserve to be tricked. And I'm not sure why everyone is getting so upset on their behalf.</div></div><hr />

Give us your moniez right away or the totally arbitrary digital items we made the fuck up years ago to swindle total morons out of their cash will be gone forever,,, or at least months until our Chief Fuck the Playerbase...

I guess it could kinda sorta make sense if they removed those types of items from the store once the charity drive ended<br />
<br />
1) quite a few of the things on the shop were originally charity items.<br />
2) How does it make sense to remove them after the charity time period ends? Just because they're no longer donating the money to charity doesn't mean people who start later on might not want it too.</div></div><hr />

Nothing is wrong in selling products but making a time limited sale for items that you cannot run out and arbitrary deciding to retire when it costs you no upkeep is a bitchy move. Especially with all what is going around gaming industry and Blizzard lately this looks like a desperate move to suck out as much cash as you can.<br />
<br />
They could just make it a sale on all or chosen goods without making it a last call.</div></div><hr />

But, if they make items that are limited time (obviously it is up to them to choose what that time period is), doesn't that help sell the items in question? For example, I have the WoW original collector's edition. So, I have the mini diablo, zergling, and panda cub. I also have the savage raptor and the amani dragonhawk from the card game. These were all limited items that are harder to come by now. I, personally, do not see an issue, but thanks for responding. It's at least helping me have an idea why some people are upset, even if I can't see it the same way.</div></div><hr />

What is wrong with a shop replacing a &quot;50$&quot; label with a &quot;DISCOUNT! FROM 80$ to 50$&quot; label? I'll tell you what - its a scummy marketing targeted at uneducated people who give no thought about the money they spend and are easily manipulated into spending more money on something they dont even need.<br />
<br />
And did you even read the comments? Noone is complaining about Blizzard selling things. Like... there's more to it than selling or not selling.<br />
<br />
Also, people are free to state their opinions (as long as they have any merit anyway, and if you were familiar with at least basics of marketing, you'd know they do), especially opinions related to sales, since feedback is a big part of marketing. Maybe forums arent just for you.</div></div><hr />

Because it is a scam. Most of the people get it that you can't make infinite amount of collector's edition of physical copy. Hell even time limited in-game items out of collector's edition could be understandable.<br />
<br />
But read the blue post man. They try to trick people that it's the last call, while they say in the next sentence: (...) (until further notice). These items may return at some point in the future.&quot;. However - the shop page says: &quot;GET IT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE&quot;*<br />
<br />
It's obviously not honest and shows their trickery. I don't really pity people who fall for that but it doesn't change the fact that they act like total assholes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's okay to have a Christmas sale. It's not okay to say you're having a sale before these items are retired and then elsewhere mention that they could come back. One is a seasonal sale and the other is just a sale trying to get impulsive people to buy things because they think this is their last chance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But doesn't that just leave them an opening so that at some point in the future, if they decide to, they can put one or more of these products into another rare bundle or sell them again? On the U.S. store it is called the &quot;See you later&quot; bundle. Usually when I tell someone &quot;See you later&quot;, it means I might see them again in the future. Oh well, I'm not going to get it, and I have writing to get to. So...<br />

I remember the very first store mount when people were panicking and acting like it's the beginning of the end and in a year max we will have full sets of gear in the shop for €. Somehow, 8 years later, we still haven't arrived there. Not that people stopped panicking.</div></div><hr />

I personally might go ahead and get this package. I have none of the items, as I rarely ever use the wow store (original authenticator and game time aside). Thanks to Legion, I have a nearly maxed out Bnet balance, a few extra tokens still sitting on a bank toon I couldn't redeem yet, a very nice mound of gold, and am paid up on my game time for another 2 years. With the holidays almost over, I wil have more time to start playing again and this will give me a something new to ride around on. <br />
As to the fake demand? I don't give a fuck. I'm not laying out any actual cash so I lose nothing and get some new shit. Sounds decent to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never understood why collectors will collect every pet and mount in the game including the long boi but don't have the store pets and mounts. Seeing how the long boi cost more gold than nearly all the stores mounts combined now.<br />
<br />
Agreed. Before the WoW Token I was super against the in-game store and absolutely refused to even look at any of the things for sale there. Since WoW token I have sold well over $1,000 worth of gold. The store items have a direct gold cost to me now, which is actually quite reasonable. I'm not as against the blizzard store anymore. It's easy to turn 100k gold into $15 and spend that on something in the store.</div></div><hr />

The difference this time is they are offering a HotS style dynamic bundle. Its not even the first time they’ve retired things from the store.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never understood why collectors will collect every pet and mount in the game including the long boi but don't have the store pets and mounts. Seeing how the long boi cost more gold than nearly all the stores mounts combined now.<br />
<br />
Because many collectors boycott the item shop cause you &quot;collect&quot; those pets with your credit card and not ingame. Since the introduction of the &quot;game time for gold&quot;-token this clear line got a bit blurred. The basic idea was that you should not even have a shop like that in a full price title with monthly fees. This was regarded as a cash grab. With the token that cash grab got even worse(yes, YOU only pay gold but someone else has to pay even more real money to buy that token. So Blizz milks even more money out of the shop if you buy a token from the AH to get one of the pets from the shop).<br />
<br />
I was a collector myself to a certain point but i can't understand why anyone would still do it these days. Blizz pumps out breeds and recolors and time sinks(to get pets and mounts ingame) in an ever increasing number(almost no investment for Blizz with quite good rewards). It's like feeding a black hole. <br />
<br />
After the ingame shop, the cards, the black market boxes, the collector editions(same game and other games) and the tokens this bundle is the sixth level of milking collectors. Let's see what will come next...twitch cheer pets and mounts maybe? It's a long, long list already and I wonder how long players will keep hunting the carrot on a stick there...</div></div><hr />

Uhm, and we care because...? It's their money. If they decide to spend it on tokens, then 1) They probably can afford it 2) It's their right, and their choice. Who are we to tell them what to do with their money?<br />

Why would you &quot;retire&quot; virtual shop items? <br />
Answer: just so you have an opportunity to try and sell a bundle.<br />

Guess store items aren't selling like they would like them to so they have to pull some limited time nonsense :rolleyes:<br />

Oh good, the stupid posts are the first ones I get to see.<br />

They aren't trying to 'pull a fast one' or get away with something, they are a 'for-profit' company running a promotion to boost sales and introduce a sense of rarity to their items. <br />

<br />
On another note, not sure why they're retiring Mischief so early... Maybe he just didn't sell very well? Edit: Saw now that he's merely listed as being part of the 50% sale. That makes sense, then I'm willing to bed this retirement is all about making room in the shop for new, better selling items. <br />
And here's hoping that the retirement of the Grinning Reaver will result in actual in-game equivalents, much as what we've seen happening with the bat mounts as of late.<br />

Nobody cares. Like nobody cares if someone artifically increases the price of HIV-treatments by 400% over night. It's his stuff, he can do what he wants with it. You do not have to buy it. It's the market. Pray to the high lord of money.<br />

You think people don't need to buy the pets...but if Blizz thought the same then why would they have created that shop? They know how human brains work. They know that although people don't really HAVE to buy the pets they will still feel the strong urge to buy them cause they are &quot;special&quot;. They abuse psychology to make money.<br />
<br />
If you buy the bundle it will do something(unlike what you claim). Just like it did with first pet people bought. If people would not have bought that first pet we might not have the situation we got today. Blizz saw back then that they can make a s***load of money with almost no work....and since that day one of those lazy decisions followed the other. Check the token. It was not introduced for the players. There is no reason why it has to be more expensive than the monthly subscription...aside from Blizz getting money for literally doing nothing. The whole &quot;what is fun for players&quot;-mentality switched to &quot;what gains us the most money&quot;....and they are really pulling all psychological tricks there by now(down to the point where they apply techniques that are proven to fertilize gambling addiction...and they use them on kids).<br />
<br />
But it's all fine. It's their game. Don't talk about your opinion about it. Keep your mouth shut. It's the market. We can't change it.</div></div><hr />

Did you just compare virtual cosmetic items in a video game to life saving medicine? I think I'm gonna have to sue you, since your post gave me brain damage.<br />
<br />
Yes, people don't NEED to buy pets, mounts, or anything else. Why Blizzard would create such items, you ask? Because people WANT those things, which is NOT the same thing as NEED &lt;insert another hard facepalm here, remembering your great comparison&gt;.<br />
<br />
Yes, companies monetize their games any way they can, only caring about profits, not the customer. I mean...Did people get born yesterday, that it's a surprise for them? Did people believe that Blizzard, or any other company, truly cares about their customers? If they ever did, it was always as a means to an end - getting more money. And you know what? As far as monetization goes, cosmetics are the smallest of evils in the gaming world. They are totally, 100% optional purchases, mostly aimed at collectors, and people with too much money. They have absolutely no influence on the game itself, and the average player who doesn't care about cosmetics. Your argument that it shows Blizzard how they can make a ton of money with minimal effort...Yeah, no. If they put in no effort into the actual game, people will quit, and stop purchasing cosmetics.<br />
<br />
As for token - of course it was not introduced for the players, does anyone truly believe that apart from 8 year olds? Let me repeat it, for those in the back - ALL COMPANIES CARE ABOUT IS PROFIT. Every decision, every move, every action is dictated by one thing, and one thing only - MONEY! But guess what - sometimes earning money, and doing something that actually benefits players too, goes hand in hand. And suddenly, the token was born. Of course it's made primarily with money in mind. But it also is hell of a benefit for most players. Most people I know haven't paid a single dime for subscription in over 2 years. Got pets, mounts from store without opening their wallets. As for whales who buy the token for €, as I said before - I see no reason whatsoever to care what they do with their own money.<br />
<br />
At least one sentence from you wasn't a total rape of your keyboard - It's their game. And they can do whatever they want with it. And you, as a player, can choose to vote with your wallet. Don't like what they're doing with their game? Quit. It's that simple. I'm sure they will miss you. Not.</div></div><hr />

They have absolutely no influence on the game itself, and the average player who doesn't care about cosmetics. Your argument that it shows Blizzard how they can make a ton of money with minimal effort...Yeah, no. If they put in no effort into the actual game, people will quit, and stop purchasing cosmetics.<br />
<br />
As for token - of course it was not introduced for the players, does anyone truly believe that apart from 8 year olds? Let me repeat it, for those in the back - ALL COMPANIES CARE ABOUT IS PROFIT. Every decision, every move, every action is dictated by one thing, and one thing only - MONEY! But guess what - sometimes earning money, and doing something that actually benefits players too, goes hand in hand. And suddenly, the token was born. Of course it's made primarily with money in mind. But it also is hell of a benefit for most players. Most people I know haven't paid a single dime for subscription in over 2 years. Got pets, mounts from store without opening their wallets. As for whales who buy the token for €, as I said before - I see no reason whatsoever to care what they do with their own money.<br />
<br />
At least one sentence from you wasn't a total rape of your keyboard - It's their game. And they can do whatever they want with it. And you, as a player, can choose to vote with your wallet. Don't like what they're doing with their game? Quit. It's that simple. I'm sure they will miss you. Not.<br />
<br />
I see, you hated that HIV-comparison. Great. That's why I used it. Believe it or not in a thread about that people used the exact same arguments you do here. It's their product. They can do with it what they want. They are not hurting anyone cause it's HIV that does the killing. It's just the next level of your failed logic.<br />
You see the dead people of HIV. You do not see the dead people of greed and wealth accumulation. You do not notice that we have more slaves on this planet than EVER before in human history.<br />
<br />
The difference between WANT and NEED is exactly one addiction away from each other. Our brain crosses that line all the time. What are you addicted to? Love is a form of addiction. You do not NEED it...but hell...if you ever felt it you WANT it again so darn much. ;-)<br />
<br />
Well, given the rumors about ALL Blizz games I'd say players are pretty much leaving. <br />
<br />
It's not anymore about making money. It's about making MORE money. And yes, in the end that will kill the game and people will learn out of it. But that means we gonna have to go through a time with a bad game...then no game...before we get something better. And all that just cause some people want to make more money(which people like you support with your &quot;arguments&quot;). Sorry, that I do not support that. I'd prefer to skip the bad game and no game part...I want good innovative games instead of lazy cash grabs.</div></div><hr />

And they even write there -these items may return in the future-.<br />

God it is disgusting. They are trying their best to monetize but it is just disgusting. I understand they are a company but their method is so so so fucking low. Pay to win rpg games level low. <br />
<br />
before you say shit to me, I own every blizzard game. both digital and actual. I have every cd-key memorized in my brain for blizzard games.nonstop wow career day one. <br />
<br />
I was terribly heartbroken with what they did a blizcon with diablo and thought there cannot be anything worse but this is a new low and in a such short period.(marketing wise) what they do is fucking low. simply disappointing, disgusting.</div></div><hr />

(it's not about skill and experience, but about time and money now: if you don't get &quot;in time&quot; you won't ever, so buy it now and people like crazy afraid to lost opportunity - I heard that you do same marketing in Hearthstone (disabling&amp;deleting &quot;old content&quot;) &lt;url (https://imgur.com/5rQ6OC3.jpg)&gt;Not that it bothered me, and quote talked mostly about content, but a funny coincidence. In general, this stuff is just little things and they won't gonna get big wealth, besides it's not clear whom they interfered in the store, are virtual shelves lack of space?...:D<br />
<br />
On other hand, you should agree, that this would be a &quot;crime&quot; to remain silent about fact that goods going to be removed.<br />
<br />
It's a business strategy as old as business itself. It's called &quot;Fear of missing out&quot;. Businesses refer to this as fomo. Chances are these items haven't been selling much at all recently since they're all so dated. So the quick and easy way to up the sales? Create urgency for the product, artificially if necessary. If you don't get it now, when will you? You may never be able to complete your mount collection! And for a lot of the long-time players who haven't gone for them yet, that will be all the push they need. The discount is just an extra incentive to ensure some good sales figures, since you know those mounts have already paid for their development time 10x over anyway!I know (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHHryH3L9hU), but just don't see much money here. They're too cheap and cosmetic. On the other hand problem is that goods will &quot;disappear&quot;... for example, similar disappearance for some of them, because they have already become &quot;classic&quot;, which means connecting a certain set of often positive emotions of themselves to the game (pets, they weren't exclusive and were always in the store), will be a small kick in the @$$ to aesthetics and in general to positive emotional background for the game (I could in some sense, even if very remotely, compare this with their crappy classic character models remake&amp;remove that became my main reason for leaving the game) = people don't like to lose stuff that they care of and don't like coercion, which means it's bad from all sides, which means they need adequate justification, but they don't have any (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2457136-Blizzard-Retiring-Three-Shop-Pets-Mounts-and-Helms-50-off-Most-Pets-and-Mounts?p=50636052&amp;viewfull=1#post50636052). What I want to say: sales (https://imgur.com/gallery/Wk35ZGl) of themselves aren't bad practice, but removal of even if some not very popular products, which support itself didn't cost anything and benefits are obvious, is already a clear negative and it doesn’t cost thouse &quot;winning&quot; money. Aesthetic association, reputation, emotional climate is more important (if you look at my posts history, I have repeatedly emphasized that reputation ruining is much easier and faster than earning it, hence it more expensive than it seams at first). I would say that this is &quot;my professional opinion&quot;, but I’ll be better off.<br />
<br />
That's why I say that it's a bit illogical and strange. You are clearing shelves of &quot;positive memories&quot; (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9OWEEuviHE) and even more: in such not very successful moment in general for the game itself. Is it more understandable?<br />
<br />
I see at least, that you in some way agree (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2457136-Blizzard-Retiring-Three-Shop-Pets-Mounts-and-Helms-50-off-Most-Pets-and-Mounts?p=50635980&amp;viewfull=1#post50635980) with me here.</div></div><hr />

People like you are literally the reason why they pull this time limited shit. Because they know you want to bite. They just have to dangle a WoW-related worm infront of you, and tell you &quot;get it before it's gone!&quot; and they've got you hook, line and sinker. Just spend your money on something else and stop rewarding this shit corporate behaviour.</div></div><hr />

and ? does it make you jealous that other people have money to blow on it ? <br />
<br />
i didnt see people going apeshit like in this thread when CMs or mage tower were limited / fomo shit. <br />
<br />
this was ok for you . <br />
<br />
i suggest playing less and focusing on carrier more if spending 20 euro every couple of months on your hobby is end of the world .</div></div><hr />

The thing is though, I do think removing CM's and mage tower were both retarded moves. I think removing any content in an MMO with a monthly subscription is a terrible idea. But Blizzard keep on doing it. I've got plenty of disposable income that I blow on all sorts I enjoy. It just annoys me seeing WoW being made into such a husk of what it was and people still keep fucking feeding it.</div></div><hr />
