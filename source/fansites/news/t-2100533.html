BlizzCon Schedule Updated<br />

Karazhan - Summoning Nightbane<br />
A community member shared the steps required to summon Nightbane, but asked to remain unnamed. <br />
<br />
<br />
After zoning in to the instance you have eight minutes to click the Opera Hall Soul Fragment (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235422-opera-hall-soul-fragment)<br />
Clicking the first crystal gives you Medivh's Echo (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/234820-medivhs-echo), which lasts eight minutes.<br />
You then need to click Banquet Hall Soul Fragment (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/235419-banquet-hall-soul-fragment), Guest Chambers Soul Fragment (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235418-guest-chambers-soul-fragment), Servant Quarters Soul Fragment (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235421-servant-quarters-soul-fragment), and Curator Soul Fragment (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235417-curator-soul-fragment)<br />
Clicking a crystal adds another stack of Medivh's Echo (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/229074-medivhs-echo) and extends the buff duration by five minutes.<br />
If you don't make it to a crystal in time, you will see a message telling you &quot;The air grows slightly warmer (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/october/airWarm.jpg)&quot;<br />
Upon clicking all of the crystals in time, you gain Medivh's Presence (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/229077-medivhs-presence) and have five minutes to get to Medivh and summon Nightbane. <br />
You may then repeatedly attempt Nightbane, who drops Smoldering Ember Wyrm (http://www.wowdb.com/items/142552-smoldering-ember-wyrm)<br />
Defeating Nightbane will also be required to complete No Bones About It (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/45296-no-bones-about-it), which rewards the final version of the Violet Seals: Violet Seal of the Grand Magus (http://www.wowdb.com/items/142469-violet-seal-of-the-grand-magus). The chain starts with Book Wyrms (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/45291-book-wyrms).<br />

Issues Continuing Karazhan<br />
Blizzard is aware of the issue players are having resuming Karazhan and investigating. <br />

Fire Mage - Flame Orb Color<br />
Patch 7.1 allows Fire Mages to hide their flame orbs, but it also makes the color of the flame around the orbs match the artifact appearance color! <br />

Items in Random Battlegrounds<br />
So does blizzard plan on removing all the fun out of a battleground? You can't use anything in them anymore. From rockets to battle standards, even my vender food and bandaids didnt work. <br />
<br />
Is this what the game is now?<br />
We understand a lot of people enjoy using many of these items in battlegrounds and we didn't intend to make them unusable. We have a fix in testing and hope to see it pushed out soon. After the fix has gone live, if there are items that used to work but no longer do, please let us know. Thanks!

Naw example: Im 2150 in 3s atm, if I win a 2s at 1900 do I get the 2150 piece or the 1900 piece?<br />
gear is rewarded based on your rating in that bracket (i.e. 2v2 gives gear based on 2v2 rating). (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/788881728010018817))<br />

To not spoil the surprise, the schedules are often not completely published ahead of time, and are modified after the opening ceremony. Recently, this was the case with Overwatch. I don't think they'll announce D4 personally, but the schedule is no proof</div></div><hr />

Thats always been the case and you'll be surprised. Most of the big announcements come during the opening ceremony. Look at last year.<br />

Overwatch was announced, Legion was announced, new sc2 content was announced during the opening ceremony.</div></div><hr />

Legion was announced at Gamescom 2015 and the cinematic and release date were announced at Blizzcon 2015 and Overwatch was Blizzcon 2014. However you were right about sc2 those crappy mission packs got announced. Last year for Blizzcon was actually pretty crappy.</div></div><hr />

It is not a challenging content, as people outgear the instance already at release. If you happen to be a M/M+ raider, you can grab the mount on day one with little effort.</div></div><hr />

It was already mentioned somewhere that there is a bunch decent sized content updates for Diablo 3, so who knows, it could be rifts themed off of D1/D2 or even new areas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know this is super duper hard for Mythic raiders to understand, but for the vast majority of the playerbase, it actually is a challenge. As a former mythic raider myself I'm shocked it's still so difficult to grasp the concept that you are in the vast minority of players who actually overgear that content.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derzorvadur</div><div class="date">2016-10-29, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's hoping Blizzard actually has interesting stuff to announce and have somewhat cleverly hidden it by not making any of the panel information give anything away. Would be a nice surprise to see that happen for Diablo and the like. <br />
<br />
Also, I think it's kinda ridiculous that they sorta give in to requests for the flame orbs to be changed color wise by only making it the flickering flames around them instead of the full orb themselves. It's hardly noticeable, why even bother if they weren't going to give us full orb coloration? I get their artists have this complex about not letting us mess with their concepts for some reason but damn.. juat least let those of us who would like more than the bare bones customization to recolor some stuff. I do appreciate them allowing us to remove them entirely though, just sad they have a relatively cool idea with the orbs but won't let us change the full orb color. Like, none of the artists thought that maybe a bright orange set of orbs would clash with a green color set?</div></div><hr />

I was hoping for some more panels on the future of WoW or some new IP to be announced but it feels like this year Blizzcon will be pretty stale.</div></div><hr />

<br />
30 EUR for 1 wow panel + the opening ceremony, get real, even the Warcraft movie on bluray is less than that (18 EUR).</div></div><hr />
