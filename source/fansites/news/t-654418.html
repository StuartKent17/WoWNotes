Warriors have the evil goat :p</div></div><hr />

Look at the chests. Each class has a little &quot;something&quot; there that makes it feel like it's made for them. For example, the DK set has the same stupid skull/face/mouth thing that every other DK tier set has.<br />

<br />
Probably what it is, tbh. Thinking that the argent tourney raid drops these and tier tokens (like how sunwell was).<br />
<br />
Looks like good stuff, but I'm leaning towards gear that is purchased or dropped and not tier.<br />
<br />
If only some of you people weren't so ignorant and work around to where it makes sense. Oh wait..............</div></div><hr />

They're definitely not. If the chests were the same for all 3 models, then I'd agree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Turns out I was wrong ... nothing ambitious at all instead now they only need to make 8 different models:<br />
<br />
1) Cloth Alliance (Mages, Warlocks, Priests)<br />
2) Leather Alliance (Rogues, Druids)<br />
3) Mail Alliance (Shaman, Hunters)<br />
4) Plate Alliance (Warrior, DK, Paladin)<br />
5) Cloth Horde (Mages, Warlocks, Priests)<br />
6) Leather Horde (Rogues, Druids)<br />
7) Mail Horde (Shaman, Hunters)<br />
8) Plate Horde (Warrior, DK, Paladin)<br />
<br />
So only 8 different models.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">0scypher0</div><div class="date">2009-06-26, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see them doing this. They did it before with both &quot;filler&quot; raids, namely Ahn&amp;#180;Quiraj and Sunwell. The same model for correspodending armor classes with different skins. At least this time the skins seem to represent the specific class. Take a Look at the skulls on the DK labeled one, and the sword on the warrior one.<br />
<br />
And don&amp;#180;t forget: They are still releasing 10 different models of armor, only this time 5 per faction and not 10 for everyone. So in the end they are doing the same amount of work, and a little extra on the skins. &#8364;dit:My bad, it&amp;#180;s 8 models. Nontheless, more skins.<br />
<br />
Personally I think this set resembles the Alliance point on. It fits perfectly fine for the tournament, and will send us to the doorsteps of Icecrown representing our home factions showing the Lichking who&amp;#180;s gonna kick his ass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah i noticed the skull on the DK one, they wouldn't put skulls on Paladin gear whereas the warrior one could easily be the Prot Paladin set. Would be nicer if i was right though ofc</div></div><hr />

<br />
:-P<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Truth. These are clearly the three alliance plate wearing classes. They each have a different symbol on the chest to show what they are. Lion for paladin, Skull for DK, Sword for Warriors (evil goat? Lawl).<br />
<br />
It's shit, but there you go. It's what most of us assumed all along. Same looks for the different types of armor, but different look for alliance/horde.<br />
<br />
But really, gear modelling has been repetitive or just plain bad since WotLK. So is anyone surprised?</div></div><hr />

The plot behind the Coliseum is that its a recruiting tool so they basically get you there, let you tool around a bit then slap an argent crusade uniform on you and send you off to war.<br />
<br />
NOTE: I still think armor homogenization really takes something away from the game, I'm just stating why I think they might actually be plate tier models.</div></div><hr />

Chances are you're going to be given the gear that'll get the job done rather than the gear that has to be constructed entirely out of the nipples of a 7,000 year-old dragon.&quot;<br />

I don't see why the Argent Coliseum shouldn't fall under this design philosophy. Lore-wise, it's perfectly solid.</div></div><hr />

lol the same skins for 3 different classes, just lame!<br />
<br />
<br />
More likely this is the off-set gear, like the rogue T8 shoulders that have 4-5 different colors for non tier gear.<br />
<br />
Also, only 5 bosses in the colliseum would also mean each boss drops 1 token, or only the last 3, with 2 being from vendors.</div></div><hr />

Money is not everything. Time is an important factor too. They can´t buy time, therefore they are limited in what amount of new models they can create considering they want to be done in a set amount of time.<br />

Because there's nobody in the country that is unemployed, actively searching for jobs. If the $100+ million they make a month in just subscriptions isn't enough to hire a few more temp artists, then they're running their business pretty terribly.<br />

Hell, I can promise you that there are thousands of people who would work for Blizz for free, just to design armor sets. Unpaid interns ftw. Can you imagine what &quot;Graphic Designer - Blizzard Entertainment&quot; would do for your resume?<br />

When you're a company, money is indeed everything, there's no excuse other than lazyness if the sets are the same for all plate wearers. If you can only produce Cloth,Leather,Mail&amp;plate sets within what's over a month then you can't argue the time factor. Hire more people and get the job done, not half assed attempts, do it right or don't bother.</div></div><hr />

Personally, and I'm sure a lot of people agree with me as most people don't play on RP servers, I couldn't give a damn about the lore behind who is giving us this set. I don't want to upgrade my gear and then think my character looks stupid. No, looks don't really matter, but they kind of do in the end. I'm going to wear my best set of gear regardless, but I'd prefer if it looks as good as/better than what I upgraded from.<br />
<br />
Comparing this to Sunwell gear is kind of pointless. Sunwell was fine because hardly anybody had gear from there. Everybody is going to be 4/5 of this stuff, and it's going to get VERY monotonous. Think S1 welfare gear, but make them all look the same, rather than different per class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, I don't know how in a world of 3 identical sets the paladin ones is the gayest. If the color pearl makes you gay, then there's lots of dudes in escalades that need to get their shit straight. Moving on, take a look at the naming it say D_01_Deathknight. Means, Deathnight Dungeon Set 1, If the paladin and warrior set said 3 then i might have a 5 man set argument, but i don't. So it's not a 5 man set. HOWEVER, it also dosen't say raid anywhere in there. In the files t8 and before were all clearly marked as &quot;Warr_raid_G&quot; etc. So a couple theories on it:<br />
<br />
1) They're the Tier, it's happened before, but only once, look at AQ40. Sunwell and ZA weren't sets, they were misc epics that people assumed should fit their class more, then Bliz turned them into pvp sets. GG<br />
<br />
2) There might be 5 man sets for conquest badges etc so the casuals have something of their own, i kinda doubt that.<br />
<br />
3) People were complaining we don't have unique off set loot. Here you go. Healing/Dps/Tank loot.<br />
<br />
If it ends up being #1 i'm not so upset because mine dosen't suck yet(Orc_Warrior.) :P But These sets ARE nice. And this happened during wrath beta with the sets the guards in ZA and icecrown wear, they were named after classes and ended up being guard/blacksmithing loot. Until we see them actually mapped to an item. We have no idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at the sets: It seems they are 'upgrades' all along.<br />
<br />
Starts with the Death Knight one (look at the chest section for all 3) looks like cloth, then the warrior set gets a bit plated but still in two-tone then the paladin one adds gold to it and more plating.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty sure it's something like what this guys is saying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We won't know for a little while longer, but the idea that they are PvP sets makes much more sense to me then the new T9, but either way at least the graphic is new, even if is the same for different class, at least it is not recolored T8!!</div></div><hr />

Some of you can't seem to grasp how difficult it is for Blizz to come up with items. They try their best to get approval of the people who PvE, PvP, and RP. If they just focused on one, the others will take it as blizz not giving a shit about them.</div></div><hr />

This isn't new arena gear. Blizzard is using a progressive design philosophy for pvp gear and this doesn't fit the look of any previous seasons.<br />
<br />
Having a similar set for all armor types just makes sense given how quickly Blizz is trying to turn this patch around and the lore of the Coliseum.</div></div><hr />

But they stated often enough they can´t and won´t say &quot;Ok, we need x amount of new artist to get so much done until then - go get some and do it&quot;.<br />
<br />
It´s not their style. They want to keep their team relatively small. They want to know everyone thei´re working with, everyone on the team has to meet very high standards, and everyone has to get what Blizzard as a whole wants to accomplish. You can´t just get some random people and let them produce some stuff if the outcome isn´t guaranteed to be exactly what fits the game as a whole. I bet Blizzard is always looking for some talented quality people, but there are only so much out there who meet their standards. (this is what I believe is behind their decisions in things like this. Maybe in the end, thei´re just talking bullshit and are as lazy as so much of you do think to know. No one can really say for sure, but with a little common sense, it sounds totally plausible.)<br />
<br />
I totally get why you don´t like what you see here Elektrik. Im not an RPer myself, but I still like the lore and the continuity in it. And if you like it or not, that´s a part of the game which sometimes will be expressed in things that directly affect most of the players.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, they have never used the same skin before for texture shares between classes, so why do it now? Answer is they aren't. People are just assuming what MMO Champ has guessed (which is pretty fucking sad that these fools can't take a minute to think).</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I said earlier, this is a new kind of raid. What bab has suggested in the OP totally makes sense for the Coliseum. Also, before 3.0 we had never had two levels of tier. Now, in 3.2, we're getting three levels of tier. <br />
<br />
My point is just that a lot of things are changing, so don't say this can't be t9 just because &quot;they've never done that before.&quot;</div></div><hr />

You obviously missed the conversation. What we WERE discussing is that they never shared the same skins between tiers, not tier and season arena gear.</div></div><hr />

And this proofs what exactly?<br />
<br />
Not done anything in the past doesn´t mean it won´t be done in the future.<br />
<br />
It´s quite possible that this will be in fact the new tiered gear, and that´s what the &quot;MMO-Worshippers&quot; are discussing here ;D</div></div><hr />

He wasn't saying SWP gear was the same as S4 gear, which it was.<br />
<br />
He was saying SWP gear looked nearly identical across armor types...which it did.<br />
<br />
Druids had skirts and rogues had pants...but they were the same skins.</div></div><hr />

Will be very sad for the set looks :(<br />
<br />
I would say that Blood Elf pally set would look interesting, but after this, guess they won't have some kind of &quot;sin'dorei&quot; design style for their particular plate set, but some savage spiked horde plate stuff to fit horde warriors and dks.<br />
<br />
They would work really well as pvp sets.</div></div><hr />

This would be my guess as well. This is hardly the first time armor types have shared very similar looks. I would not be surprised at all if these are the gear sets that drop in CC...but what &quot;tier&quot; they are is completely arbitrary.</div></div><hr />

blizzard has no interest in doing something for the customers, because they are the most stupid gamers over the world.<br />
<br />
blizzard can make what they want, and the customers dont do anything. <br />
So what WotLK is today, is your fault.<br />
<br />
11 million people who plays the game - and no one do anything about this.<br />
<br />
The most people of WoW went to the new MMO, because WoW will be go out. <br />
WotLK was the last addon for their mmo - and if not, then you will get a content patch, for which you must pay to much.<br />
<br />
The last &quot;content&quot; like ulduar or the addon itself was a joke - after a few days you played it through. <br />
There is no challenges like in the past.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the next step of WoW will be a mmo with monthly fee - and an itemshop!!! So can blizzard get more money than before, because they have 11million stupid gamers, who pay for this.<br />

<br />
Considering the amount of money they make off wow each month alone, I wouldn't fathom that they could afford someone or even a team to do nothing but design unique tier sets. That would surely put them out of business. And, since I'm fairly sure blizzard doesn't plan ahead with patches or expansions, there would be no way for that team to know what theme to design for.</div></div><hr />

Yeah...bring back the UNIQUE models...like the original grand marshal gear! And AQ40 gear! We don't want lame ass gear like t8 where every leather wearer looks the same...we want PIMP gear like guilds that cleared SWP earned there!<br />
<br />
wait...what? Again...similar gear designs for the same armor type IS NOT NEW. The CC will NOT be the first instance of gear having a similar design.

Aren't the artists / designers pretty close if not the same people? I highly doubt blizzard has someone standing over the artists shoulders saying, &quot;make it look like this.&quot; That would remove the whole concept about being an artist.<br />
<br />
Go take a gander at some of the starcraft 2 concept drawings / artwork. They are flat out amazing. I find it hard to believe that blizzard does this part of the game so poorly. Well in advance, they should have 20, 30, even 40 different drawings (no need for 3d work) for each class tier armor. It seems simply like a lack of effort. How hard would it have been to make a new, unique tier armor for naxx at the launch of your NEW EXPANSION? Yet they re-used an old version...<br />

Well I am a Graphic designer (and took game design), and what I have to build is done pretty much for me in most cases as far as concept, we are told to follow it as closely as possible, unless we want to give ideas and input. For the most part, you do what your told if you want to keep your job. and as other posts were saying, it actually is the new sets they added to the tournament, and they are epic/blue quality, I just don't know wherther they are drops from the 5 man or buy able.

The reason non-set pieces look the same as Tiered pieces is because crybabies whined so much that when they got BiS that wasn't a set piece, it didn't match the rest of their gear. Now you can get BiS and still match your tier set and now the first half that wasn't crying about the way gear looks is crying about the way gear looks.<br />
<br />
This argent Tournament is on par with ZA and ZG it would seem. This isn't Tier 9 armor. Tier 9 is for Icecrown (3 Tier's per expansion) and it matches up with the previously mentioned instances filling in the gap between Tier gear. We're getting only 5 bosses.</div></div><hr />

you are fighting a tournament. The reason is to pick the best champions, that will face the lich king. Those will be granted the best gear that the Argent Crusades blacksmiths, tailors and leatherworkers can make!<br />
<br />
And what reason would they have to make a pala armour different from a warr? (the ctafters that is, not blizz)<br />

Armor looked the same for each type (cloth, leather, &amp; plate) with varying colors per class. It appears that is the approach they are going with this patch. Obviously it's gotten a lot harder to classify the sets given that there's been two versions for the past 2 recent tiers but if we could go by looks alone, I think this would be the T8.5. (I realize everyone says 25Uld gear is T8.5 but as I stated, I'm going from the perspective of models alone, not stats)<br />
<br />
T1 MC<br />
T2 BWL<br />
T2.5 AQ<br />
T3 Naxx<br />
T4 Kara/Mag/Gruul<br />
T5  SSC<br />
T6 BT/SWP<br />
T7 Naxx<br />
T8 Ulduar<br />
T8.5 Coliseum<br />
T9 Icecrown<br />
<br />
I'm especially inclined to believe this theory due to the evidence provided with the naming convention. The tier sets are always listed in the same manner with the last letter corresponding to the different tier.</div></div><hr />

You... can't be serious. I agree that this won't be tier 9, but 'ZA' level stuff put in between the full sets. Though I just don't believe that you honestly think this looks &quot;amazing&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only argument against this is the fact that the names of the textures include &quot;ArgentAlliance&quot; which should trigger the idea that it'd be acquired through the Argent Tournament, hence the Coliseum. I'm sure when Horde files are included in the next patch they'll say &quot;ArgentHorde&quot; as their naming convention.</div></div><hr />

For the most part, you do what your told if you want to keep your job. and as other posts were saying, it actually is the new sets they added to the tournament, and they are epic/blue quality, I just don't know wherther they are drops from the 5 man or buy able. ITS NOT T9<br />
<br />
<br />
I too am a graphic designer. And you're right for the most part, when doing work for other people you're told to follow a concept / guild line, or what the end image should look like / represent. <br />
<br />
We are talking about blizzard who could go buy North Korea and end the shit thats about to start. I'm sure they could afford someone or a team to to do nothing but design and draw A LOT of tier / dungeon armor concepts and make them look unique.</div></div><hr />

So far I've gathered up:<br />
1. Bought gear<br />
2. Epics dropped in new raid<br />
3. New dungeon sets<br />
4. Items NPCs wear (highly unlikely but a possibility)<br />
5. Tier (still a possibility)<br />
6. New PvP/Arena gear<br />
7. Test armor (not sure if they have done it before, if they haven't then this is scratched).</div></div><hr />

These sets may have the same molds, but if you look at them....I mean, really look at them...You'll notice they do not share the same textures...Not even close... For example, compare the chest pieces with all 3 of these sets and tell me they're the same...Look at the gloves next...Yep they're different looking too.<br />

At least they're not like the Sunwell or AQ 40 sets, where they were all the same sets (depending on armor type), but just palette swaps.</div></div><hr />

They could easily do this with a similar color scheme/design on the gear (and I actually kinda like it when you look at it that way), however making all plate/cloth/leather/mail wearing classes have the same skin is just extremely unoriginal and very boring.</div></div><hr />

Look at the sets: It seems they are 'upgrades' all along.<br />

Starts with the Death Knight one (look at the chest section for all 3) looks like cloth, then the warrior set gets a bit plated but still in two-tone then the paladin one adds gold to it and more plating.<br />

Look at the chest pieces, they correspond to the different classes. Those are going to be the 3 sets for Ally plate wearers...did you HONESTLY think blizzard would design 20 different sets? Hell they hardly try to design 8.</div></div><hr />

For example my Pali picked up alot of non-set items from Naxx and Uld. the Naxx look like the DK T0, and the Uld look likes warriors. they have been doing this since raid one in WotLK. the only time you look 100% differant is if you have a full Tier set, and tbo usually is not the BIS anyways.<br />
<br />
I personally like the look of the sets. They represent not only the Argent well but also each class. Can't wait to see the Horde versions and the Cloth/Leather/Mail</div></div><hr />

making a game with around 10 mill people world wide paying each month to play.. that is far from stupid.<br />
But never the less, they have gotten less creative, at least in my oppinion. I dont mind they reuse here and there, but for the love of god, what is up with this ugly set, tier set or not, it looks stupid.. or the helm looks stupid. A night want to look cool. Tbh... Wotlk up untill Naxx and Maly... Awesome looking gear models... Ulduer weapons is Power Rangers ftw, but the T8 is awesome.</div></div><hr />

Just call it Colosseum 25<br />

I agree, never thought that it was going to be a tier set like T9. The original sets were all called dungeon sets back in Classic but the players started calling them tier0, .5, 1, 2, 2.5, etc. Blizz finally started using the term of tier in TBC, but still its just another dungeon set to them.</div></div><hr />

Indeed. It isn't confirmed as a Tier. and I doubt that with every instance they gonna add new tiers. In the end we will be at T11 or 12..... 2 expensions later at T60</div></div><hr />

You obviously haven't looked at the file list where it perfectly states the codes for each item (which says Paladin,Warrior, and Death Knight). Also, they would not be so stupid to not give people who do 10man heroics. Why give the others something and just say fuck off for another?</div></div><hr />

These are clearly the three alliance plate wearing classes. They each have a different symbol on the chest to show what they are. Lion for paladin, Skull for DK, Sword for Warriors (evil goat? Lawl).<br />
<br />
It's shit, but there you go. It's what most of us assumed all along. Same looks for the different types of armor, but different look for alliance/horde.<br />
<br />
But really, gear modelling has been repetitive or just plain bad since WotLK. So is anyone surprised?<br />
<br />
<br />
It was understandable 70-80 ....<br />
<br />
Naxx at least had different weapon models<br />
Ulduar drops the different weapon models except for a couple minor exceptions.<br />
And now Trial is dropping different models for different classes! <br />
<br />
Unique chest icon just makes it worse really, since it's generally the shoulders and helmet that define a set's look anyways.</div></div><hr />

Look-it, every set piece doesn't need to have propellers and particle effects that don't make any sense on them. These are tournament sets, and frankly I think it's awesome that all plate classes share the same similar style only with a slight variation.

really? common they got enough people investing enough time into there game they could either hire a couple of decient designers, using recycled armor sets is getting old. theyve been doing it forever. way back from t2 on. if u ask me all they gota do is do what there doing with pvp season gear. upgrading it from season to season. make a nice base tier and make it upgrade from tier to tier. OR put it out to the community and have a tier design contest for some fresh ideas from the people who play the game itself.jebus!!! i got tons of ideas kicking around.</div></div><hr />

Ppl never heard of the word Uniform? The Argent is gearing an army to defeat the Lich King. <br />
<br />
Imagine this in a modern army, where the tank driver runs around in pink shoes, white pants and a pink shirt. The Medic's runs around in all blue cloths, the HMG gunners use desert cammo, the AT-gunners using polar-cammo. And this little bunch of men goes to war in the jungle! Seems perfect!!!<br />
<br />
No, the tank drivers, the medics, the HMG gunners and all other personel got a 'jungle-cammo'... <br />
<br />
One vast army of men in an uniform looks more impressive and frighteing than a bunch of ppl in random cloths.<br />
<br />
Army vs Radom guerilla<br />
Argent vs PuG...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jukaï</div><div class="date">2009-06-27, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another person who can't think for himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gee, let's think for myself with the information at hand:<br />
<br />
- Back in TBC we had this little place called The Isle of Quel'Danas, which lorewise, was nothing but a military staging ground against Kil'Jaeden and his forces.<br />
- Now in WoTLK we are once again on a military staging ground, this time dubbed 'The Argent Tournament' where we train to fight Arthas and his forces.<br />
<br />
Similar ? Just wait.<br />
<br />
- On the Isle of Quel'danas was a vendor who sold a new tier level of gear - via tokens and an exchange system.<br />
- On the Tournament Grounds will be a vendor who sells a new tier level of gear (even a set this time!) via tokens and possibly again an exchange system.<br />
<br />
The Argent Coliseum will have (going by the achievement) seven boss encounters:<br />
<br />
Gormok the Impaler <br />
Acidmaw<br />
Dreadscale <br />
Icehowl<br />
Lord Jaraxxus <br />
Edyis Darkbane - Fjola Lightbane (Hey look, another Sunwell similarity)<br />
Last Boss<br />
<br />
<br />
We go fight bosses in the coliseum, defeat them, get a token, turn it in. We've been doing this for nearly every instance from Naxxramas 1.0 - fairly decent system, happens to work.<br />
Now, we all know each set consists of five tokens: gloves - legs - chest - shoulder - head.<br />
<br />
Assuming Gormok the Impaler and Acidmaw will not drop a token but offspec items (think boots/belt/bracers) it's fairly safe to assume the following:<br />
<br />
Gormok the Impaler <br />
Acidmaw<br />
Dreadscale - (Gloves)<br />
Icehowl - (Leggings)<br />
Lord Jaraxxus - (Chest)<br />
Edyis Darkbane - Fjola Lightbane (Shoulders)<br />
Last Boss (Head)<br />
<br />
<br />
Plus additional items like non-set items and weapons, obviously. With maybe even a Sunmote-like item and the aforementioned exchange system, since I do not see Blizzard try to cram a loot listing similar to the one of Naxxramas over 'just' 7 bosses.<br />
(But this is all a big guess on my side, since the new badge system in WoTLK could mean a smoother distribution of items)<br />
<br />
But how will we know the difference between a Warrior and a Paladin if all the plate looks alike ? Simple: textures and colouring.<br />
But how will we tell each set from each difficulty apart ? Again simple: colouring - 3 classes x 3 sets = 9 colour schemes.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's safe to assume it will be indeed 'Sunwell all over again' - just be glad that this time the sets (most likely) will look a whole lot better and we will be able to differentiate a Horde character from an Alliance character. <br />
<br />
And to the folks crying about how it all 'looks the same': what do soldiers do IRL ? Exactly.</div></div><hr />

Someone mentioned that not every gear need to bling, and magic effects. I totally agree, but then in that sense, I feel that these sets looks too magic. They would be better with plainer and more metallic looks. But ill wait and see, personally I believe all gear looks crap on human models, so it is hard to judge anything when u play a different race.</div></div><hr />

See Ahn'Qiraj &amp; Sunwell Plateau<br />

<br />
<br />
They're definitely not. If the chests were the same for all 3 models, then I'd agree.<br />
<br />
*Same model for all three sets which strictly for the sake of this comment I shall call tier9, three different skins.<br />
<br />
Anyways, on a side-note, assuming that they announce an additional expansion to World of Warcraft at Blizzcon (and not their other game in development);<br />
as long as they don't try to pull some bull@!#% like they did in Wrath of the Lich King and say like... <br />
&quot;We believe that not enough of the player-base had a chance to fully experience Nax... Sunwell Plateau, so we're going to go ahead and re-tune it to be the level 85-90 entry-level raid instance.&quot;, then I'll already mark it down as plus+ 1 in my books.

Oh i'm sorry, here I thought the point of advancing along an MMO was to bring more and more to the table. You people act as if anything given to you by blizzard is a godsend. You eat it all up, because Blizzard holds anything for 6-8months, letting you starve on the current content, so when they release it you gobble it up. It's like starving a dog long enough that putrid food looks appealing to them.<br />
<br />
Blizzard continues to digress more and more, and i'm not talking about making the game more casual friendly, I mean they just ARE NOT trying anymore. We have gotten 1 patch of inspired content with Ulduar and even then, the instance is NOT that large at all. The largest part being the FL event, which you do in a matter of minutes.</div></div><hr />

I have all my tiersets in the bank still. Maybe I am just lucky to be a lock, but so far all sets ( maybe apart from T4) looked pretty good for my class.<br />
<br />
Look, so what if we like 90% of what Blizzard does. That is why we play the game, because we have fun. That is why we pay..because we have fun. Not because Blizzard came to my house and brainwashed me.<br />
<br />
Why do YOU still play. And if you don't...on what mission are you here?</div></div><hr />
