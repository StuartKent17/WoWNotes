On the contrary I dislike the mage set colours. They give of this plastic feeling to me, too bright in my opinion. I would much rather have the priest colour set. Of course I'm still jealous of the locks.</div></div><hr />

I will now as a Draenai male hunter, wear the T9 armor with pride. ;D<br />
<br />
Edit: After checking out the Draenai Mage,Warrior, DK and Paladin sets.. these too look awesome. Draenai look damn good in any gear, with there huge upper body. Imo Draenai's FTW in alliance gear, followed by nelfs. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you really expect them to make 20 new armor sets? I don't think so. So they combined armor sets on same armor classes on the same faction instead, so there is still a variety.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, Bobouille, but you might have to reupload the HD Paladin screenshots, you're using the DK legs wit the Paladin set! It's fairly noticeably awkward too.</div></div><hr />

Honestly look at all the great changes they are bringing this patch, more pve AND pvp content, lots of bug and class fixes. Exp stop and pvp exp, mount system overhaul and some stat behaviour overhauls. They are brining some great game improving changes BUT you don't like the tiers sets so therefore they fail and are lazy.<br />

And two, should I quote myself? Please go design 20 new gear sets while working on all of the things Blizzard has to work on. Then your argument would be valid.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Your point is a complete fail, in all honesty, some of the armors look good, some look bad it's the same with all tiers. The problem is that they didn't make 20 armors, they failed altogether on putting this crap together. You say OMG 20 new designs thats insane. I GURANTEE YOU, that it does not take that long for the people who have been doing this for years to make sets of armor, and if so, if it does take long, there is nothing wrong with delaying a patch just so that the gear actually looks decent. Each individual set may or may not look good, but put them altogether and it's ridiculous. COOL BLIZ we can tell ourself apart from the alliance now, despite the fact that we could already do it before, the only problem now is that we can't tell our priest/lock/mages apart. gratz on the fail. I can also imagine that yes after a while it comes hard to come up with ideas, i mean lets face it, a majority of the game ideas and sets have been recycled throughout wow a hundred times, it happens, but tier shouldn't be that case, tier 7 made sense because the very few people that actually had tier 3. But i can't find a single excuse for this crap idea, other than bliz just wants to rush things out to make more money and keep us interested. Although i always thought Quality &gt; Quantity, or rather in this case Quality &gt; the shit their shoving down our throats. <br />
<br />

Also will the generic (non-set) drops from Colisseum raids and the 5man instance use the same armor models? Or is there another generic set for every armor type? (tbh I would like if they would use the tier graphics as then I could gear up my alts to look kickass ;D )</div></div><hr />

You go ahead and design 20 new sets, while working on current, past, AND WAY INTO THE FUTURE content. Seems like caps are the only way you people can read. <br />
<br />
<br />
You know you are talking about a multimillionaire company right?<br />
If they keep working on the s**t they couldn't fix the last patches why do they release new content? ... They should do a good work with all the money they get per month, not just put the first thing the drunk buddy saw on his head &gt;,&gt;</div></div><hr />

Glad you like the sets, I do like horde shammy and cloths. Ally cloths are not to bad. But as for a tier I think they all fall short of what we are used to in epicness. just imo.<br />
<br />
Well most of these forum nubs tend to forget that, so I usually just tell one anyways just to let one know.<br />
<br />
Well it's only a filler patch, and most likely the stat difference on these items won't be much of a change from T8/8.5. Most likely these will just be total upgrades for the people who couldn't really get passed the keepers for tier pieces (believe me when I say I've been in guilds where these were problems, only due to lack of focus). Also, these will look much better in-game, don't you agree? Weren't people complaining about the tier sets looking embarrassing since idk.......vanilla WoW? T7 recolor, people wore it and got use to it. T8 people were complaining about looks again, people wear it and like it. I see the same thing happening with T9.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, though to people the stats should always be greater than the looks (although if you're a giant walking penis, I think you may bend the rules a bit).<br />
<br />
The only thing I want to know is for horde cloth, that weird triangular piece in the back.......Idk if it's a hat or like the helm design for priest T1, but it bugs the character's hair and makes it look awful. Hope they fix it.</div></div><hr />

Wrong. If you can't even follow PTR news, don't open your mouth.<br />

T9.5 (hard mode) gear will be ilvl245 at the lowest. Currently T8.5 is ilvl226. It's a huge jump, at least as big as the jump from T7 to T8.</div></div><hr />

Uhh.... T8.5 is 232....<br />
And it is a huge jump... And they are adding 25 Man Hard modes from certain bosses which will give 258 Ilvl. I wouldn't call this a filler patch.<br />
Also is it just me or do all the classes that share a armor type look exactly the same except for a color swap... And if it you look at shamans and hunter ( Alliance ) they were too lazy to even do that.</div></div><hr />

Not a fan of the rouge, hunter, and shamans sets though. The look great but aside from the lava on the shaman shoulders i don't get the feel for the class out of them, the ally side just fits more, particularly the hunter. Still won't stop me from wearing it though</div></div><hr />

Good amount of detail and textures compared to the older tiers.<br />
<br />
Alliance<br />
<br />
Plate - Love it, Awesome textures<br />
Mail - Love the hunter colors, the green/brown on shamans look dull to me<br />
Leather - Helm looks dumb on Males but good on Females, love the shoulders<br />
Cloth - Not much to say, I like it but it looks generic<br />
<br />
Horde<br />
<br />
Plate - Compared to the other sets this looks slightly boring, I was hoping for something more &quot;bad-ass!&quot;<br />
Mail - Hunter looks awesome! I hate the Shamans colors. Purple? WTF?<br />
Leather - AWESOME! by far the Coolest set.<br />
Cloth - Wicked! Yet the helm bothers me. is that a hood? or just something in the back?<br />
<br />
Also on the Whole &quot;OMG MY GUY WILL LOOK LIKE EVERY1 ELSE!!! OMG FLAME!!! TROLL!!<br />
<br />
doesn't Every one already looks the same anyway? And most of the time don't you use a bunch of different peaces? Right now I look at a prot pally and see the Warrior Tier 8 model helm with Tier 8 Pally shoulders.

Where's Cenarius, where's Elune, where's everything regarding nature in there? It really seems like an overpowered mail fighter and nothing else. Bah, really horrible, imo. Alliance druid set is not perferct, but far more beautiful and coherent...<br />
<br />
Then I look back at the horde priest set (with the beautiful T7-T8 in mind) and omg, they made it a lumberjack with a skirt... :o The same for horde mages, as they have THE SAME model :'(<br />
<br />
Horde paladin too, comparing to the alliance model, seems like a &quot;paladin summer suit&quot; with those holes to better take the sun...<br />
<br />
Blizzard, come on, what bad has Horde done to you for it has to be punished this way? ??? ???</div></div><hr />

How completely UNORIGINAL to give all the wearers of the same armor class the SAME armor but different colors. It was bad enough when they made the season's pvp gear equivalent to the tier gear (tier 4 = season 4) but this is just ridiculous.

We went an entire expansion with the PVP gear being nothing more than a recolor of the corresponding PVE gear. Not to mention the AQ, ZA, and Sunwell sets that were designed with a similar philosophy in mind (except that there wasn't the horde/alliance distinction with those). Are memories really that short? Or is it simply because they labeled it Tier 9 instead of &quot;Tournament Set&quot; that everyone has gone on this crusade of entitlement?<br />
<br />
Through all of this, everyone has conveniently passed over the work they've put into the new weapons. But that's fine, continue complaining about a game you are obviously unwilling to stop paying for, even though it's quite clear you hate every decision that they've made for the past 5 years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It kinda looks like leather from sunwell... Kinda... maybe that is why you think it is good for druids. Meh... These sets have ups and downs. <br />
<br />
Ups: they look like they are from the argent coliseum, kinda pvpesque<br />
they are made with amazing detail and have many little things to look at that just make you go, &quot;awww&quot;<br />
Differen Models for horde and alli<br />
<br />
Downs: recycled gear for each gear type. All plate looks the same cloth the same etc.<br />
They look very VERY pvp (in the new sense of pvp gear) to be a pve tier imo<br />
They just don't have that umph you want from a tier imo. You know... bad ass effects going on, intricate designs all over the place. <br />
<br />
Ups and downs. but I am not entirely displeased as long as hopefully a t10 arises (god I hope they dont stick with the 3 tier an xpac thing with this one) that blows me away from IC, and it isnt like a sunwell that you get &quot;oooo more pieces to tier6!&quot; and another tier. If a t10 comes out of IC (crosses fingers) (prolly will) then I am fine with this. albeit I prolly will never have t10 :(</div></div><hr />

They make over 200 MILLION dollars a year off WoW SUBSCRIPTIONS alone. (Likely well over a billion total when you consider licensing revenue, expansion revenue, realm / gender / faction swaps, legacy games, investments, etc)<br />

Do you honestly think they spend even 10% of that on the game? $20 million dollars a year? Not likely.<br />

Those shoulders look like they could take an eye out - as do every set of plate shoulders I've seen pretty much from BC on up. Just what exactly is my female Draenei supposed to be overcompensating for? Everything else about the sets looks pretty cool (I love the colors for the warriors). Well, okay, not everything. I also think that all the cloth and leather sets look like they're made from platemail too, but that's something I can overlook. Having to wear gargantuan shoulders just irks me. I always have my helm and cloak hidden - most of those are incredibly fugly too, or in the case of the cloaks, have fugly animation/movement associated with them. If they added the option for shoulders, I'd turn it on in a second.<br />
<br />
There's only one guy in my guild that doesn't use the &quot;hide helm&quot; option. I'm sure many other people are in a similar boat. What does it tell Blizzard when people say that a particular piece of gear is so obtrusively ugly they don't want to see it on their character (or have anyone *else* see it on their character) ever? Shouldn't it encourage them to design pieces of gear (especially for the tier sets, which people work *hard* for) that players *want* to show off? Or is it perhaps just an issue on my server that I notice with people hiding helms?</div></div><hr />

Lets see if it gets the reception it deserves.<br />
<br />
Oh lets not forget some of the item stats on the armour and weapons....things couldn't be even more sexier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't help but keep yawning at how dull the horde leather looks ~o~<br />
<br />
Yes, I went there. <br />
<br />
No but seriously. The level of detail in the Alliance set is ridiculously high. Too bad they think the &quot;penguin mask&quot; looks good (because I don't either), but the &quot;corset&quot; matches those old school outfits they wear in like Shakespearean plays. It wouldn't look so obvious anyway when a belt is worn across it. The shoulders (minus the pouches--I think this is geared towards Rogues) though and the color scheme itself looks amazing. The level of detail on the Druid kilt is awesome, though I am not a fun as much of the Rogue pants.<br />
<br />
The Horde leather, on the other hand, looks too much of a leather, it looks like it drops from a mob you kill from Outlands. It looks very generic and bland, and the yellow light bulb does not help either. As a Druid myself, I feel sorry for the Tauren who have to wear that gear, which clearly is designed with Rogues in mind. <br />
<br />
That's the design just by itself. Now slap that on say, a gnome, and everything just blows up. Even the Alliance cloth just does not match the gnomes' huge heads at all. It seems like they never took the races into account when designing the gears. -.-</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alliance Plate - Okay, this I actually don't hate. I'm not a fan of the head blades, but it looks pretty good.<br />
Alliance Mail - Ehh, nothing spectacular.<br />
Alliance Leather - Let me just say, this is my favorite of the Alliance sets. Especially on Druids. The &quot;bird mask&quot; and shoulders fit perfectly with the Druids. That said, I'm kinda split between the Druid and Rogue versions of this set, since the Rogue version looks kinda stupid by comparison. Except on Night Elves for obvious reasons. As a final thought, what's with the female versions showing off cleavage? Yeah, THAT'S really practical in a fight, exposed breasts. Why not just say, &quot;here, stab me in the heart.&quot;<br />
Alliance Cloth - Good for what it's worth, but kinda bland.<br />
<br />
Horde Plate (not including Paladin) - Same as Alliance plate. Fits really well with the Horde.<br />
Horde Paladin - This is by far my favorite T9 set. I'm not a big fan of the spikes on the head, but the set is undeniably Blood Elven and undeniably great. This is exactly why blood elves should've gotten access to the Onslaught warrior set.<br />
Horde Mail - Another nice look, but I can't help but hope the Shaman versions have robes.<br />
Horde Leather - It's okay. Nothing spectacular, nothing boring, just kinda in the middle.<br />
Horde Cloth - MUCH better than the Alliance cloth sets. By a considerable margin. It's not as good as, say, Tirisfal, Tempest, Aldor, Voidheart, Corruptor, Avatar, Incarnate or Absolution (yeah, I have a thing for the BC cloth sets) but it's really good. Might be the best cloth stuff of WotLK, despite how good Sanctification looks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a quirk with the way they rigged the orc model to display shoulders, not an issue with the shoulder models themselves. Remember back in BC when all male orcs had the ridiculously small shoulders? Same thing. =P</div></div><hr />

The textures from t4 to t9 have been alarmingly upgraded. Plus, there was at least 2-3 sets of t4-t6 that looked like shit.<br />
<br />
Horrible T4:<br />
Hunter<br />
hmmmmmmm, how lucky of T4. Apparently no love for Hunters.<br />
<br />
Horrible T5:<br />
Druid<br />
Hunter<br />

its pretty obviouse that blizzards Cgrade artists are working on wow atm.<br />
<br />
I wish SC2 and Diablo3 could hurry up and get published so the real Blizzard artists could get back to making teir armor as good as the Black wing lair era ..<br />
<br />
creativity is at a all time low .... i expect the Island of conquest to be horible BG.. shiiizzz i hope they can turn this game around next expansion they REAAAAAAAAAAAAAAlly need to fix every thing now in my books..<br />

PVE PVP ARENA DUELing all broken... only thing thats good atm is Questing... what the hell!!!!<br />

I'm loving the bird theme. I've always been balance and have had so far to put up with looking like a deer, a moose, a blossoming tree, an orange tree, and some kind of shamanistic eagle, not to mention T7 with the dragons on the shoulders ... this new set looks perfect for a moonkin! I'll still have a beak and feathers even when I shift out of form - and I'm digging the corset and skirt with glowy gems. The only thing that looks a bit out of place for a druid is the pockets on the shoulders ... but hey, maybe those are to carry out all the extra armour sets we need ^^ - heck, give us 2 shoulder bags in addition to the keyring and all our other bags, and I will *love* that graphic. hee.<br />
<br />
I know T1 and T4 had feathers on them, and T6 had birds on our shoulders, but 1 was too garish next to this (waaaaaay less detailed), 4 looked too power rangerish and I missed my kilt, and T6 was like I said - too much like something a shaman should be wearing. This new T9 is great - a mixture of the arcane and the natural, just what a boomkin druid absolutely should be. :D</div></div><hr />
