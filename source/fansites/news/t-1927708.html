Pet Battle Bonus Event – December 30 - January 4<br />
Through Monday, January 4, Pet Battle experience gains are increased by +200%. There’s never been a better time to get out there and level up your mighty minions!<br />
<br />
Before you head out into the wild with your lower-level wild things, make sure you pick up the quest “The Very Best”. Because you’re the best – around – you’ll want to queue up for PvP Pet Battles with a team of three level-25 pets. After only five wins during the event, you’ll be rewarded with an Ultimate Battle-Training Stone, which means another level 25 is on its way to your collection.<br />
<br />

One of the things I love is Highmountain quests divided in questlines like the Divine Bell achv<br />
Yeah, we prefer that format too. I'd expect to see that for the other zones a bit further down the line. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/681232411808546816))<br />

Don't have every flight path mount as a player mount by now? So it could still become a mount.....<br />

Not at all what that means. It means that there is currently no spell for it. The exact same thing was said about the demonsabers, the moose mount, etc. Just because it doesn't have a mount spell yet, doesn't mean it won't. In fact, I'm quite sure that it will be the DH flying mount.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, most of the &quot;machinima&quot; videos I see today are voice overs with characters that loop the talk animation on backgrounds. These are much nicer and had a lot more effort put into them.</div></div><hr />

If you like those you should check out Quest Busters pt. 2, it is hilarious and has amazing animations. Also check out their 3 part MoP series &quot;Anton Pourqoi No Rerolls: Pandaria&quot; an &quot;Anthony Bourdain - No Reservations&quot;- parody. It's even dubbed in English, so you don't have to read subtitles.<br />

<br />
Only now that you mentioned it. The only thing that really stuck out to me was how badly animated it is and how it looks like it's struggling so very, very hard or has no control over its body. Which is pretty much how the heart of the aspects moves too. Like the animators were working on it so long they could no longer tell what was wrong with it.<br />
<br />
Multiple colors is not evidence of something not being a store mount. Four colors were datamined for the windsteed.</div></div><hr />

Don't see anything on it that guarantees or excludes it as a store mount. <br />
<br />
If I had to guess, without seeing many other Legion mounts if they use a local species as a store mount, this would be it. It has feet so looks normal as a flying mount, and we know there are storm drakes and probably Eagles. (in Highmountain) Neither look like store candidates at all.</div></div><hr />

I think the awkward flight animation is way more of the issue than the appearance. If they can tweak the wing flaps before launch, it will be really good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The last completely new model animation was created back in TBC. Modeling a completely new skeleton with animation requires real hard work. So instead of new developments, we got recycled stuff since TBC. Reskins mostly and sometimes minor, partial changes to models. Maybe they can't reshuffle their development team to let more workers do what produces quality stuff and/or can't hire more developers because of the risk of poverty. I can feel their pain. /sarcasm.</div></div><hr />
