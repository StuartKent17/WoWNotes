Warlords of Draenor - Game Responsiveness<br />
I know this is a very open question, but is there anything &quot;under the hood&quot; with the responsiveness changes that could impact theorycrafting? <br />
I was wondering when this'd get brought up. I've hinted about this in the past in a couple interviews... Yes, there was a very significant underlying change here, that may have implications for theorycrafting (though minor).<br />
<br />
I don't want to get too deep into the under-the-hood workings of WoW servers, but here's a super short version. Any action that one unit takes on another different unit used to be processed in batches every 400ms. Some very attentive people may have noticed that healing yourself would give you the health instantly (minus client/server latency), whereas healing another unit would incur a delay of between 0ms and 400ms (again, on top of client/server latency). Same with damaging, applying auras, interrupting, knocking back, etc.<br />
<br />
That delay can feel bad just due to the somewhat laggy responsiveness feeling, but also because the state of things can change during that time. For example: Holly the Holy Priest is healing Punky the Brewmaster. Punky spikes low, and Holly hits Guardian Spirit in a panic. The server verifies that Holly is able to cast it, and that Punky is alive (great!). The cast goes off, Guardian Spirit goes on cooldown, and a request is placed for the Guardian Spirit aura (that prevents dying) to be placed on Punky. That request will be filled next time the 400ms timer loops, which happens to be 320ms from now. 250ms later, the boss lands another hit on on Punky. Punky dies. Sadface. Another 70ms goes by, and the Guardian Spirit aura request pops up, and goes &quot;Hey guys, I'm here!... Aww... damn, I missed the party. Sadface.&quot;<br />
<br />
We no longer batch them up like that. We just do it as fast as we can, which usually amounts to between 1ms and 10ms later. It took a considerable amount of work to get it working that way, but we're very pleased with the results so far; the game feels noticeably more responsive.<br />
<br />
I can't guarantee that you'll never ever again run into cases where Guardian Spirit went on cooldown and the tank still died... but it'll be literally 40x rarer than before, and the whole game will feel more responsive too.<br />
<br />

In the next build, visit Shattrath, in Outland, and you'll find...<br />
<br />
Test Realm Dummies!<br />
There are dummies setup for damage dealers on the SW and SE sides of the inner ring, for tanks along the NE side of the inner ring, for healers along the NW side of the inner ring, and for raid groups on Aldor Rise.<br />
<br />
Here's a list of what's there:<br />
<br />
Weak Damage Dummy – Level 100. Comes in clusters of 5.<br />
Dungeon Damage Dummy – Level 102.<br />
Raid Damage Dummy – Level 103. Comes with two Dungeon Damage Dummies next to it.<br />
Killable Damage Dummy – Level 103. Is Killable. Has 20million health.<br />
Mythic Damage Dummy – Level 103. Is Killable. Has 300million health.<br />
<br />
Weak Tank Dummy – Level 100. Swings for 5000-5000 damage, 1.5sec swing timer.<br />
Dungeon Tank Dummy – Level 102. Swings for 60000-90000 damage, 1.5sec swing timer. Has a “Dummy Strike” attack, which does 50% Weapon Damage as Physical, 5-7sec cooldown.<br />
Raid Tank Dummy – Level 103. Swings for 200000-300000 damage, 1.5sec swing timer. Has the same “Dummy Strike” attack.<br />
Mythic Tank Dummy – Level 103. Swings for 300000-450000 damage, 1.5sec swing timer. Has the same “Dummy Strike” attack. Also has an “Uber Strike”, which deals 100% Weapon Damage as Shadow and increases damage dealt by 5% per stack, 1sec cast time, resets swing timer, 10sec cooldown, unlimited stacks.<br />
<br />
Healing Dummy – Level 100. Friendly. Drops to 1hp every second.<br />
<br />
Cauldron of Power – Clickable objects on the ground that will grant you all raid buffs, and the flask/food matching your current spec's stat attunement.<br />
<br />
Does this mean 100 premades are inc in the next build as well?<br />
We're working on that. I hope they make it into that build, but not 100% positive.<br />
<br />
(Also, I know I'm behind a few days on this thread, trying to catch up. I'm going to be on vacation for a week starting tomorrow afternoon, so trying to get caught up before I leave.)<br />
<br />
Will Fury Execute OH function like RB OH, Storm Bolt OH or Whirlwind OH? Also, did any of the following mechanics change?<br />
In Warlords, as of next build... <br />
<br />
Execute, Raging Blow, and Storm Bolt will work like this: Perform the Mainhand hit roll. If successful, also fire the Offhand attack, which always hits. (Same as now for RB, different for SB, new for Ex)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Slight technicality here, if you're looking at the spell IDs involved in the logs. RB's root spell is just a cover spell that contains separate MH and OH spells. The root spell can miss, the MH/OH spells cannot.<br />
<br />
For SB/Ex, the root spell is the MH damage, which can miss. If it hits, it fires the OH spell, which cannot miss.<br />
<br />
Whirlwind will work like this: Perform the Mainhand hit rolls. Independently, perform the offhand hit rolls. (Same as now)<br />
<br />
1. Anything that applies either disease, including icy touch, howling blast, plague strike, outbreak, and unholy blight ticks, will, if necrotic plague is already active, instead add 1 stack to affected targets, and not affect the duration.<br />
Correct.<br />
<br />
2. Festering strike's 6 second extension will not change current stacks, but is the only thing that will add on duration to an existing stack, allowing for an additional 3 ticks at max strength per festering strike.<br />
Correct.<br />
<br />
3. Pestilence spreads necrotic plague from a target that has it to targets that don't have it. Pestilence has no effect on targets that already have it, neither changing duration nor stacks.<br />
If you have Scent of Blood, it will effectively recast each disease that they have (refreshing/extending BP/FF, and adding a stack to NP). If you don't have Scent of Blood, it will find the longest duration one of each type, and clone that copy to the other targets, replacing their current debuff (and yes, that applies to NP, even).<br />
<br />
4. When necrotic plague jumps on it's own, it jumps with it's existing stack size and duration. This allows it to naturally spread to 2^n targets, where N is the number of ticks. (1, 2, 4, 8. 16, 32)<br />
Correct.<br />
<br />
When necrotic plague jumps on the last tick, does that tick spread?<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Unholy seems to be able to maintain a permanent 15 stack with festering strike, which spreads to all adds as a 15 stack, and whenever it falls off an add, another add spreads it back to said add. It doesn't seem to want to jump to a target that already has it, so how does the following case work?<br />
<br />
T=0, duration on target 1 is 30 seconds, and 2 seconds on target 2. Tick happens, no open targets, no jumping occurs. <br />
T=2, duration on target 1 is 28 seconds, and 0 seconds on target 2. Tick happens on both, Does the disease jump to target 2, or is there a 2 second delay before it can jump, having a tick be missed?<br />
Disease jumps just as the last tick happens, so there's no break in tick periods.<br />
<br />
1: Will multistrikes attempt to proc from attacks that miss/parry/dodge?<br />
2: Will sweeping strikes duplicate multistrikes?<br />
3: Will multistrikes be counted into ignites?<br />
<br />
1) Looks like they currently do, but shouldn't. (Or, alternatively, the Multistrikes should be able to miss). Will solve that and report back with which way we decided to go.<br />
2) As usual, no double-dipping on Multistrike. Sweeping Strikes can Multistrike. Multistrikes cannot Sweeping Strike. So, maximum procs from one Execute would be... Ex, Ex-MS, Ex-MS, Ex-SS, Ex-SS-MS, Ex-SS-MS.<br />
3) Yes. Multistrikes trigger Ignite. Ignite cannot Multistrike.<br />
<br />
So just to clarify, doom should always gain the damage boost from being cast in meta, even when not in meta? Currently on beta if you cast doom and leave meta, it will loose the meta damage boost.also side note bug, toc doesn't extend corruption to the 24~ seconds you can get from pandemic extending. instead it just extends it to the base duration. (I assume this is a bug).<br />
<br />
Correct. Yeah, those are bugs currently. There are a lot of &quot;shoulds&quot; and &quot;woulds&quot; in what I said because I'm not sure which way it works right now, just clarifying which way is intended.<br />

Warlords of Draenor Story<br />
I'm feel like I'm already supposed to know these characters, and it's kind of like being a stranger at a party where everyone else knows each other.<br />
One super important thing to keep in mind is that the alpha is currently lacking the Warlords of Draenor intro experience we're working on. By the time you reach the point where the current alpha template characters start, you'll already have been introduced to many of the characters you're interacting with. That should hopefully make you feel like less of a stranger.<br />
<br />
Still, it's good feedback. Keep it coming! Tons of great feedback in this thread so far. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/320334-thoughts-so-far/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13139064115?page=1#9))<br />

If I have Pyroblast! buff, use pyroblast (instant, +25%dmg), and multristrike - does the multistrike'd pyro get the +25% buff?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476068129097781248))<br />

you still left 20% wings, holy avenger and added Seraphim. Why did you add a burst cd talent? 3 cds too much again.<br />
Big difference between a 30 second cooldown and a 3 minute one. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475885014165368832))<br />
<br />
Everyone is less of a threat outside of cd's, however Ret is far weaker. Templar's Verdict should be more of a threat as a finisher<br />
TV feels weak because when you press it, 3 numbers spawn instead of 1 big number. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/476112479945105408))<br />
3? TV+Mastery should be 2, or? Do you count autoattack?<br />

With lvl 90 talents for Priests no longer doing damage as Holy, will we be ablo to cast them in Spirit of Redemption?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476104324540407808))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Any chance we'll ever see the Que requirement for heroic scenarios, lowered from three people to two? Or even one. Would love it<br />
Unlikely while they are current, but in 6.0 you'll be able to go back and solo queue for any Mists scenarios. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/476055932724457472))<br />
<br />
what consumable buffs will we have in wod? Secondary flasks, food (secondary?), and one time battle potions?<br />
Pretty much that. Plus health potion/Healthstone on a separate shared cooldown. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/476060780823990274))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
I think i am, i thought the intent was random people facing each other. Another question: Is there a minimum item level for solo q?<br />
That's a pretty generic intent. Random people face each other in every part of PvP. No min ilevel but gear is scaled up to a min. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475787888055951360))<br />
<br />
Also I'm presuming the main reason for Skirmish would be 'I have noone to Q with'.For that the current isn't good solution<br />
I expect high level players will do very little skirmish. Just as they do little normal battlegrounds. That's fine. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475798003320508416))<br />
what prode is saying. High end arena players will do skirmishes for honor grinds if its efficient vs bgs<br />
that's fine, but they aren't the intended audience. Once they have gear they will end up in rated. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475830685693800449))<br />
while many people primarily play random bgs, some people will primarily play skirmishes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/475830989931814912))<br />

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/gb-en.png Pre-purchase WoD at Selected Retailers from June 17!<br />
Starting June 17, you’ll be able to pre-purchase World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor Standard Edition at selected retail outlets across Europe.<br />
<br />
Picking up a special Standard Edition pre-purchase box ahead of the expansion’s release this Fall will let you upgrade your account to Warlords of Draenor immediately. And of course, this gives you a level 90 character boost which you can use any time you like! These pre-purchase boxes, which are only available before the game comes out, don’t include a game disc, but instead everything is linked to the digital code inside. Apply it to your Battle.net account before release, and all the content will automagically download through the Battle.net app so you’ll be able to play Warlords of Draenor as soon as it’s released. Oh—and there’s a cool poster inside too.<br />
Pre-purchase copies of Warlords of Draenor will go on sale June 17 at selected European retailers. You can find the list of these retailers here (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10763376323?page=1).<br />

<br />

Well, not very soon. But soon-ish.<br />

Looks nice, but really? this is where they are at? still on base poly level for some scenary and buildings, obviously non-populated, non-furnished areas are huge. I really would have thought, given the time scale they are supposedly working to, that they'd at least have the zone terrain fleshed out more.

Apparently I always use it inside that 400ms interval. God dammit. It's so frustrating.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Granyala</div><div class="date">2014-06-18, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That delay can feel bad just due to the somewhat laggy responsiveness feeling, but also because the state of things can change during that time. For example: Holly the Holy Priest is healing Punky the Brewmaster. Punky spikes low, and Holly hits Guardian Spirit in a panic. The server verifies that Holly is able to cast it, and that Punky is alive (great!). The cast goes off, Guardian Spirit goes on cooldown, and a request is placed for the Guardian Spirit aura (that prevents dying) to be placed on Punky. That request will be filled next time the 400ms timer loops, which happens to be 320ms from now. 250ms later, the boss lands another hit on on Punky. Punky dies. Sadface. Another 70ms goes by, and the Guardian Spirit aura request pops up, and goes &quot;Hey guys, I'm here!... Aww... damn, I missed the party. Sadface.&quot;<br />
<br />
So all these years the healers yelling &quot;The heal was through!&quot; when someone died.... they were right?<br />
Great change tho. I hate that &quot;WTF I did heal / buff that guy in time yet he still died&quot; feeling.</div></div><hr />

In Warlords, as of next build... <br />
<br />
Execute, Raging Blow, and Storm Bolt will work like this: Perform the Mainhand hit roll. If successful, also fire the Offhand attack, which always hits. (Same as now for RB, different for SB, new for Ex)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Slight technicality here, if you're looking at the spell IDs involved in the logs. RB's root spell is just a cover spell that contains separate MH and OH spells. The root spell can miss, the MH/OH spells cannot.<br />
<br />
For SB/Ex, the root spell is the MH damage, which can miss. If it hits, it fires the OH spell, which cannot miss.<br />
<br />
Moderate damage boost to Fury? <br />
<br />
I really hope they give Fury some love for WOD, PVE I know its viable and a strong spec but in PVP I really would like to see them make it viable, especially considering they're investing time and re-designs in Prot to allow them to DPS effectivly. This isn't a QQ or a PLZ FIX MY SPEC, its simply a &quot;I hope that Fury is given a slight boost in PVP in WOD&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Wish they would make the game less grindy in a condensed Environment and use that time to create more varied NPCs.<br />
<br />
That's how it goes. The amount of re-used skeletons is garbage and inexcusable. Everquest expansions manage to crap out multiple new mob skeletons and they release those yearly</div></div><hr />

I really like the &quot;dinosaur age&quot; kind of look they seem to have gone for. It reminds me of if Un'Goro Crater and the Barrens had a lovechild :) looks fantastic. The colors are gorgeous too. I wasn't looking forward to this zone much, but now I totally am!<br />

I hope they will as many details everywhere.<br />

Agree. It looks like it could come from Wildstar, graphically-wise. Which is a big compliment, considering that's a 2014 game and WoW's engine is from 2005.<br />

Trying SO hard not to look at art, screenies, MoP's big open beta was terribad for making the content age Fast for me :\<br />
<br />
<br />
Heh, I'm the same way. Well, except that I avoided pictures of MoP as well. I didn't look at all the screenshots of Gorgrond for example, just a few to get an impression. And I also absolutely do not watch any gameplay / quest / zone exploring etc videos of the alpha or beta.</div></div><hr />

No. Gorgrond is pre-portals Blade's Edge Mountains.<br />

Gorgrond is a &quot;glistening oasis&quot; that gives way to a &quot;desolate, rocky badland&quot; where the Blackrock clan's foundries are located.</div></div><hr />

This one reminds me of Cataclysm Barrens. it's a brown desert-ish area, but with lush overgrowth and tons of jungles.<br />
<br />
I love this, i love that the jungles here actually look wild and untamed with plants everywhere like you'd need a machete as an actual jungles should look instead of neat and clean with a nicely paved road through it all like a nice walk down a public park. I'm assuming the megabeasts are a chain of rare mobs in the zone, (possibly across the whole continent?). the graphics definitely look alot more updated, and it seems that only Blizz could make what seems like a dry, boring desert from the surface, turn out to be a beautiful landscape teeming with life and activity upon closer inspection.<br />
<br />
Anyways, my favorite pictures so far are these two:<br />

Just so amazing, it's a shame Blizzard gets all the unreasonable hate for the hard work they do. It's even funnier how in early screenshots of the zones, people said how bad it looked, and now people are singing a completely different tune. Gorgrond and Nagrand are probably some of the most beautiful zones in the game as of yet, and i'm super hyped for the game right now despite all the hate. Keep up the good work Blizz!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zypherz</div><div class="date">2014-06-18, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Omg... I'm REALLY surprised at how good gorgrond looks, I mean - Of course the lush, sholazar basin/barrens oasis theme is gorgeous - But on top of that I think the rest of it is really nice as well! The whole zone feels very barreny (in a great way) and the lushness of it really balances the theme! One problem I have found with 'end zones' in the past is that they're usually very grim and depressing - This has really got it right, it seems to have the theme of the 'final zone' but it isn't a complete eye sore either. Really excited, have loved every zone so much to PIECES (which is more than I can say for every other xpac tbh) - I'm really really really excited to see Tanaan jungle, we've seen so little and it's the one i'm most excited about.<br />
<br />
Honestly, i've been very 'meh' about WoW recently, I couldn't care loads about clearing hc mode (stopped just after siegecrafter hc, or very near to getting a kill anyway) as I was just bored and couldn't be bothered anymore. Now I raid very casually with friends 2 nights a week, we haven't even started hc mode yet and i only really play to raid and VERY occasionally maybe do 1 bg. But this expansion, it's just polishing up so much... I feel like that's what they've needed to do tbh - Instead of hurtling more 'meh' content at us (don't get me wrong, I loved ToT and a lot of things about MoP but it still felt.. meh), they're, for the most part, just making everything they deliver absolute top quality even if it means making us wait a while for us. I don't want to wait ages, I really don't - But it looks like it might pay off. These zones look stunning, the gear scaling down seems awesome, the new gear looks awesome, harder heroic 5 mans with LFR level gear (perfect alternative to get gear fast but with the trade off that it's difficult). The only things i'm not really happy with is the fact that we still lack a proper day/night cycle (Seriously, a RPG needs immersion - This would be a serious - SERIOUS, factor) and the dozens of difficulties. The game feels a bit weird where-as most of the content is at max level instead of the 'traditional' style of spending most of your time just leveling up in RPGs. I don't like it, but whatever - For what we have in the game, i'm impressed and excited for it. There's things i'd like to change, but from the last couple weeks of info i'm looking forward to WoD a hell of a lot more than before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is something monumental. It's huge. As a brief time as a healer, with moderate and acceptable latency, I know for a fact that this happened on a weekly basis. If you count the times people wiped in any environment, cause a heal or taunt didn't go off in time. Imagine how much time and energy over the course of 10 years has been wasted, because of this fault.<br />
<br />
This fix is huge and WILL be noticeable at the top Tiers of play.</div></div><hr />

For example: Holly the Holy Priest is healing Punky the Brewmaster. Punky spikes low, and Holly hits Guardian Spirit in a panic. The server verifies that Holly is able to cast it, and that Punky is alive (great!). The cast goes off, Guardian Spirit goes on cooldown, and a request is placed for the Guardian Spirit aura (that prevents dying) to be placed on Punky. That request will be filled next time the 400ms timer loops, which happens to be 320ms from now. 250ms later, the boss lands another hit on on Punky. Punky dies. Sadface. Another 70ms goes by, and the Guardian Spirit aura request pops up, and goes &quot;Hey guys, I'm here!... Aww... damn, I missed the party. Sadface.&quot;<br />
<br />
So all these years the healers yelling &quot;The heal was through!&quot; when someone died.... they were right?<br />

1. Depthroot. Is that a play on deep throat? It just struck me as odd when I read it.<br />

I mean, none of this stuff existed before Garrosh took over or went back in time to Draenor, so is he the one designing all of this or is it just a random industrial revolution from a collection of no-name theoretical architects?<br />

Yeah by now most folks have gotten used to it. But getting used to a problem and solving the problem are two different things. I'm very glad Blizz removed the issue altogether. <br />
<br />
Having playing a lot of League of Legends and coming back to WoW after a hiatus. The delayed responses feel god awful. I never was sure what the root of the problem was but you could definitely sense a disconnect between your inputs and the in game's response to them. And not having the crisp responsiveness in a game makes it rather frustrating at times.</div></div><hr />
