Gear Changes in Warlords of Draenor<br />
I read this all, and I like it, a lot. Good stuff. However, my fear is how this plays out for PvP. For PvE variance in performance based on RNG stats is super cool and creates a sense of non-uniformity, but in PvP you need to be able to expect that class X generally has Y capabilities.<br />
PvP gear will have more stats to choose from, and less worrying about hit caps! PvP Power will likely still exist to make sure PvP gear is powerful without being more powerful than PvE gear in PvE. Additional PvP changes are beyond the scope of this discussion, but we do want to make sure PvE gear doesnâ€™t outstrip PvP gear for world PvP.<br />
<br />
Can I just ask what will happen to Spirit for Shadow Priests, where it is now a go to stat because it gets converted to Hit? With Hit going away, will it convert to something else, or will Spirit now be useless for us.<br />
Healers will have increased baseline regen on their character, and each point of Spirit will have higher regeneration effects. As mentioned in the last couple paragraphs, Spirit will be useless to DPS specs, so min-maxers will want to get alternate gear for the few slots they have Spirit in.<br />
<br />
One more thought on this...please extend this system to crafted gear, not just boss drops.<br />
Okay!<br />
<br />
So what for the peoples who spent a fortune on gems an jewel crafting just to have a useless pro now.<br />
Despite this being a bit beyond the scope of this discussion, we can say that we donâ€™t want to keep a flawed gear design just to ensure revenue for Jewelcrafters. We are, however, considering additional types of things that they could make to offset the need for so many gems.<br />
<br />
I dislike the idea that we're going to have to pray to the RNG gods to get gear to drop, and then pray again that our gear has bonuses. I'm not invested in world first content so it likely wont affect me much, but I can imagine world first guilds getting a little peeved because guild X got extra lucky on their drops and had more tertiary stats which helped them progress faster, while guild Z got mostly normal epic drops.<br />
Philosophically, having a random element to gear helps to keep loot feeling exciting instead of reducing it to a checklist you just tick off. We understand that too much randomness can be frustrating, which is why we implemented things like the bad luck streak protection on personal loot and bonus rolls. Do note that secondary stats on gear are not random (other than some random suffix items, which are in the minority). The additional qualities (e.g. Warforged, sockets, tertiary stats) are random and are intended to provide gearing with a long tail. Rather than deny you an important item slot like a weapon, we can make sure you get an item in a reasonable amount of time. However, getting the perfect item is not a foregone conclusion and might take a lot of effort and luck.<br />
<br />
The only system where this loot style could work is in the personal loot like lfr. I find it hard to believe that you think that this could realistically work in a normal raid group that uses any type of loot system other than rolling.<br />
LFR will always use personal loot. Normal and Heroic difficulties have the option (raid leaderâ€™s call) to use personal loot, or to drop a variable amount of loot based on the number of players. As you add players to a group, the chance of an additional piece of loot dropping will increase until it reaches 100%, at which point there will be a chance for an additional piece beyond that. There should not be any break points at which you are hesitant to add more players. Mythic has a set raid size so will work much as Heroic does today.<br />
<br />
Random Player:Will these changes to stats only affect items in Warlords of Draenor, or will older items from, say, Burning Crusade also change?<br />
At this time, changes to gear are planned for drops in Warlords of Draenor. We are, however, considering modifying Siege of Orgrimmar gear to help players make the levelup process as smooth as possible, but aside from the removal of Hit and Expertise from all gear these changes will not be retroactive.<br />
<br />
Random Player:How will these changes affect mastery?<br />
We may make changes to specific masteries as part of the Warlords of Draenor review, but donâ€™t have any sweeping changes planned.<br />
<br />
From Twitter: Nathyiel: What about off-hand/shield?<br />
They are considered &quot;weapons&quot; for the purposes of these system changes.<br />
<br />
Are more tertiary stats being considered than the 5 we've been shown thus far?<br />
This list we have at this time is not set in stone, but currently includes: Leech (heal on damage dealt), Inspiration (heal on damage received), Cleave (extra damage to additional targets), Sturdiness (reduced durability damage), Speed (movement speed), and Avoidance (reduced area effect damage taken).<br />
<br />
Getting gear is fun. We like getting gear and we like the feeling that on any given boss, there should always be something that you would want. What weâ€™re doing with items in Warlords is just an evolution of the Thunderforged version to make it a little more interesting. Youâ€™ll probably see more bonus pieces than you did Thunderforged in the past, but getting an item that has all 3 bonuses will be very, very (very!) rare. Remember, youâ€™ll be just fine with the baseline pieces of gear, and most of your character will be made up of this gear. But each and every time you kill a boss, thereâ€™s that chance of getting something slightly better.<br />
<br />
One of our other goals is to reduce the amount of work an item takes. Currently, the amount of work (math! MATH!) you have to do in order to even put on a piece of gear takes away from the enjoyment of the actual item dropping. We want you to spend more time killing creatures and getting better gear and less time figuring out how that piece that dropped effects specific stat levels (hit, expertise, haste, etc.), what gems you need cut, and what enchant to put on it. Weâ€™re not removing all of those choices, but weâ€™re drastically tuning down the amount of required work. Get your boots, put them on, next boss!<br />
<br />
Another reason for these item changes are to bring hybrids closer to fulfilling their off-spec role. Part of the fantasy of being a warrior is that you can take the punishment when you need to (tank), or dish it out if you want to (DPS). However, collecting two entirely different sets of gear, plus gemming, enchanting, reforgingâ€¦ itâ€™s all different and itâ€™s just a lot more work. In most cases, it was too big of a barrier for some players to even consider. With these changes, weâ€™re bringing your off spec closer to the performance of your main spec. You wonâ€™t have to collect the same Chest set piece twice, or say, get a different set of boots. However, if you want to be optimal, there will still be items to collect.<br />
<br />
Question, will the gear's secondary Stats from raids be static when they drop or are they rng and be random generated stats?<br />
The vast majority of raid gear will continue to to have pre-determined secondary stats, just as it does today. We may still put in a few alternative pieces with randomly-generated stats, much like we did in Throne of Thunder, but those will be rare exceptions.<br />
<br />
This extends to other types of content as well. Every once in a while, when there's a compelling reason to, we might let gear randomly roll secondaries. Timeless Isle is a good example of a situation in which that style of gearing makes sense. Again, that's the exception, not the rule. Under normal circumstances, secondary stats will still be pre-determined, not random.<br />

Over the history of the strip, Ghostcrawler was depicted as the MCP, and later his crab claws got added. Started with this strip:<br />

No, however when MMO-champion links to it, it's traffic increases by probably 50-100x instantly.</div></div><hr />

When the strip went on hiatus, I switched to a much less expensive hosting plan since I didn't need all the extra performance. Should have had the foresight to realize a new strip might mean an MMO-C cameo. I went back in to the site config and turned it back up for the next couple days, hopefully that should help.</div></div><hr />

Yeah the problem is that it's INGAME now people can play the game without having the store popup in the face however that may change. It's amazing they got a store in the first place I pay 15 bucks a month for this game and I not have any way to get this damn pets ingame! And even more items getting added check out that icons!!</div></div><hr />

I think that's probably too much to hope for. CRZ - as terrible as it is - is most likely here to stay. Connected realms seems like a MUCH better idea.</div></div><hr />

A massive quantity of inexperienced players will see it once, not quite remember the blue outline bit, and a fake prompt could just leave the &quot;blue outline&quot; part out and they wont even remember.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard has our account security in mind they should copy Bank of America or something similar; they have a &quot;sitekey&quot;, where any time it asks for my password it displays an icon I previously selected and a phrase I entered. That way, it's obvious it's legitimate because nobody else would have that information. All they would have to do is have you select an icon, there are obviously enough there already, and have an input where you can type your own &quot;security key&quot; or something. Then the prompt simply says &quot;Only enter your information if you recognize your security key below&quot;.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, this is a disaster waiting to happen. I've dealt with almost every type of phishing/scam/fake form you can think of over years and years of web development and security consultation, and while I understand the idea behind the outline it is NOT enough. For one, I doubt it's impossible to overlay something that looks at least SIMILAR. Two, as I said before, just leave out the &quot;only official blizzard requests will have the blue outline&quot; or whatever it says, and enough players will not remember that it should be there (without the prompt reminding them) to cause an issue.<br />
<br />
Seriously, I know it's the PTR and nothing's final, but this is one time where I strongly believe Blizzard will leave this as-is without some sort of explanation as to why it's absolutely the wrong route to take.</div></div><hr />

Uh, no, he's saying &quot;We understand that it's a pain for the jewelcrafters to possibly lose a portion of their income and we will do everything we can to compensate for that, but you cannot expect us to balance the game and an entire expansion of changes around one profession and the people that have it wanting to earn more gold with it, especially considering that they are not locked to the profession and can change it at any time.&quot;<br />

One of our other goals is to reduce the amount of work an item takes. Currently, the amount of work (math! MATH!) you have to do in order to even put on a piece of gear takes away from the enjoyment of the actual item dropping. We want you to spend more time killing creatures and getting better gear and less time figuring out how that piece that dropped effects specific stat levels (hit, expertise, haste, etc.), what gems you need cut, and what enchant to put on it. Weâ€™re not removing all of those choices, but weâ€™re drastically tuning down the amount of required work. Get your boots, put them on, next boss!<br />

<br />
Yeah. And to me, spending time reforging/regemming isn't what MAKES you hardcore. It's a requirement to be hardcore at this point, but hardcore is the time and effort you put into raiding. A casual is somebody who logs on and doesn't put any serious effort into doing anything, doesn't spend much time on, possibly isn't very good at the game, etc. To be a hardcore raider, you are required to reforge/regem with almost every significant upgrade. To be a hardcore PVPer you must do the same, but to a lesser extent sometimes. Either way, a hardcore raider is still a hardcore raider whether he has to reforge after every upgrade or after every 4 upgrades. So yes, I am reading the same thing as you. Are you reading the same post I made before this? Peoples definitions of the word &quot;casual&quot; change on a daily basis, especially if not &quot;casual&quot; means &quot;not wanting to have to hearth out of the raid every time you get a significant upgrade to compensate for the stat differences on a ring&quot;<br />

I agree. Anybody who has the audacity to call Ghostcrawler &quot;rude&quot; just hasn't been a part of the MMO genre for long. The amount of communication he offered has been pretty much unheard of until now, especially on a constant, reliable basis.<br />
<br />
And the comment about &quot;whatever coding errors are left&quot; just shows how little people really know about his role and how game development works. If you think code or any potential coding errors are automatically on him, then... well, you've basically countered your own point with that one comment. Being the lead systems designer doesn't mean you're sitting there coding everything. In fact, as the lead systems DESIGNER I'd argue that he probably spent the least time coding out of everybody in his team.</div></div><hr />

We like getting gear and we like the feeling that on any given boss, there should always be something that you would want. What weâ€™re doing with items in Warlords is just an evolution of the Thunderforged version to make it a little more interesting. Youâ€™ll probably see more bonus pieces than you did Thunderforged in the past, but getting an item that has all 3 bonuses will be very, very (very!) rare. Remember, youâ€™ll be just fine with the baseline pieces of gear, and most of your character will be made up of this gear. But each and every time you kill a boss, thereâ€™s that chance of getting something slightly better.&quot;<br />
<br />
So in a nutshell: yes, it's about extending the gear grind.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, I really don't care as I don't see myself playing this expac that much. Then on the other hand, it seems like a pretty shitty thing to do. <br />

Uh, yes, he is saying that &quot;we do not care about the profession you chose.&quot; Saying &quot;things change&quot; because this is a patch and expansion based game is unreasonable. That would be like Blizzard deciding to nerf warriors into the ground with the new xpac to the point they are useless. Then them throwing out &quot;oh hey we are thinking about possibly giving them a new ability that would make them less useless.&quot; By your reasoning this would be acceptable because after all, this is a patch and expansion based game. <br />
<br />
An MMO company could literally get away with doing anything they wanted by using your reasoning and fanboi's could trot out this line at all times.</div></div><hr />

This is of course operating under the misguided perception that only you can judge what is and isn't valuable to all people, then deem their mental capabilities lesser than your own accordingly. While I'm not a huge proponent of this, I'm not so conceited that I think people are stupid for buying pets and mounts. It's their money, they can do what they want with it. Until they are sacrificing sustenance and/or necessities for living (needs) then we can hardly deem them mentally unfit.</div></div><hr />
