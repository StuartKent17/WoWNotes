<br />
World of Warcraft 64-bit client soon?<br />
According to the latest changes in the interface files of the Patch 4.2 PTR client, it seems that Blizzard is finally getting ready to release a 64-bit version of the WoW client.<br />
<br />
<br />
GlueStrings.lua<br />
if ( IsWindowsClient() ) then<br />
if ( Is64BitClient() ) then<br />
dllURL = SCANDLL_URL_WIN64_SCAN_DLL;<br />
else<br />
dllURL = SCANDLL_URL_WIN32_SCAN_DLL;<br />
end<br />
end<br />
<br />
AccountLogin.lua<br />
SCANDLL_URL_WIN32_SCAN_DLL = &quot;http://us.scan.worldofwarcraft.com/update/Scan.dll&quot;;<br />
SCANDLL_URL_WIN64_SCAN_DLL = &quot;http://us.scan.worldofwarcraft.com/update/Scan-64.dll&quot;;<br />
<br />
<br />
And as I write this news post I can already see the confused look in your eye: &quot;Wait? What? Who cares?&quot;. Well, this change means two things:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
People with 64-bit Operating Systems (= anyone with more than 3gb of Memory, most likely) will see a slight increase in performance. <br />
People who regularly experiences crashes when World of Warcraft uses too much memory will finally be able to play WoW without crashing every x hours/minutes. (People playing in super high resolution, or with a boatload of addons)<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course nothing is official yet, but there's a glimmer of hope for the increasing number of people with 64-bit systems. However, I'd like to point out that we're only seeing a couple of strings in .lua files and not real changes so I wouldn't expect it for Patch 4.2. <br />
<br />
<br />
iPhone Mobile Authenticator App Update<br />
Due to an issue with the latest version of the iPhone Battle.net Mobile Authenticator application (version 1.3.0), we've temporarily taken down the app from the iTunes store. Rest assured that we're already working on a new version and will be providing an update in this thread as soon as that new update is up. Please note that until the new version is made available, iPhone and iTouch users will be unable to download the app or upgrade it to the latest version.<br />
<br />
If you use a non-iPhone version of the Battle.net Mobile Authenticator, have not upgraded to version 1.3.0, or if you upgraded an existing version via iTunes but have not retrieved a new serial number, your Mobile Authenticator should be unaffected by this issue and continue to function as normal. Regardless if you retrieved the update or not, there is no security threat or risk associated with the Authenticator's ability to continue protecting your account while attached.<br />
<br />
As always, if you are experiencing any issues with an Authenticator or Mobile Authenticator, we encourage you to contact our customer support staff for assistance - https://us.battle.net/support/en/ticket/submit<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

Patch 4.2 - Memento Mori + Method vs Occu'thar (Baradin Hold)<br />
Memento Mori (http://wow-mm.com/) and Method (http://www.methodwow.com/) teamed up on test realms to go kick Occu'thar's ... eyes. Occu'thar is the new boss of Baradin Hold and if you have no idea of what's going on in this fight, don't worry, there's a dungeon journal entry for that guy too! <br />
<br />
Occu'thar (Baradin Hold)<br />
This ravenous demon broke free of its cage and gained access to the western wing of the prison, devouring all of the inmates held there. Occu'thar's gluttony resulted in a body too bloated to escape its environs, effectively turning the prison wing into its new holding cell. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Focused Fire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96884/focused-fire/) - Occu'thar sets his gaze on the location of a random player, then inflicts 35,000 Fire damage every 1 sec to players within 12 yards of the targeted location. <br />
Searing Shadows (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/101007/searing-shadows/) - Occu'thar inflicts 105,000 Shadow damage to players in a 60 degree cone in front of him, and increases Shadow damage taken by 100% for 30 sec. <br />
Eyes of Occu'thar (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96920/eyes-of-occuthar/) - Occu'thar forms an Eye of Occu'thar on every player for 10 sec. The eyes bore into their target hosts with the Gaze of Occu'thar.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gaze of Occu'thar (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96942/gaze-of-occuthar/) - The Eye of Occu'thar gazes at its target host, inflicting 6,000 Shadow damage every 1 sec for 10 sec.<br />
Occu'thar's Destruction (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96968/occuthars-destruction/) - After an Eye of Occu'thar remains attached to a player for 10 sec, it fully bores into the host and detonates with Occu'thar's Destruction, inflicting 25,000 Shadow damage on all players.<br />
<br />

LOl,looks a lot like Pascal programming<br />
Looks more like pseudo code to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wouldn't they have to recompile the entire game to be 64 bit native?<br />
Not too sure about your question. If you mean do they need to recode the game from scratch, no they wont have to but it would be easier to do so albeit more effort to do so.<br />
If you mean do they need a separate executable for 32 bit and 64 bit? Yes and no (they share the same library anyways), but with a launcher, I see no reason why they dont make it into 2 executable.</div></div><hr />

Like the filename says, it is lua code (same code you write wow addons in), but with that syntax it could just be almost any programming language ;) it's just variable declaration after all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes they would, but recompiling is the easy part ;)<br />
<br />
The problem part with migrating 32bit C to 64bit C is that the 32bit code has to be absolutely clean (no int size assumptions, missing function prototyping, etc.). /if the 32bit code is not fully clean it will take quite a while to get it &quot;64 bit ready&quot;, especially with a program the size of WoW.</div></div><hr />

It makes sense that a 64-bit DLL would be used for collecting this hardware and software information on a 64-bit Windows platform.<br />

I'm almost certain this has nothing to do with an actual 64-bit Windows client.</div></div><hr />

You would be right, but as of patch 4.1 Blizzard's been compiling the WoW executable with a large address aware flag. :P <br />

<br />
No. Absolutely no one should be crashing because of an address space limitation now. The large address aware flag bumps it up to 4 GB on x64 operating systems and 3 GB on x86 operating systems (assuming the x86 OS will acknowledge the flag in the first place; not recommended).<br />
<br />
A 64-bit executable would not further increase stability at this point. It would help with performance and may give the devs some extra room to work with for, say, caching purposes, but it won't help with out of storage crashes anymore. If you're seeing an out of storage crash now, your cache folder is likely the culprit. Deleting it should fix things up.<br />

WoW already scales nicely with CrossFire and SLI. Another WoW player and I posted our own benchmarks here:<br />

Each and every test that I've run has shown that multi-GPU setups are, indeed, beneficial. They're not officially supported, per se, but the drivers and game engine are evolved enough to make things run well.</div></div><hr />

I put together some tools that did this as well; however, post-4.1, WoW is compiled with the LAA flag by default. I linked this before.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Resa</div><div class="date">2011-06-04, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To clarify one point:<br />
Wow doesn't crash anymore from using too much memory..<br />
<br />
Blizzard added the Large Address Aware flag in 4.1 - which allows 64bit users with 6 gig of ram to automatically use up to 3gb of RAM for WoW (previous Blizzard recommendations for LAA)... <br />
Most of the crashes we saw were from multi-monitor setups, using high/ultra settings, and even under these conditions, wow only used slightly more than 2gb.<br />
<br />
Theres really no reason for needing 4gb when wow runs perfectly under 2gb (except in certain circumstances).<br />
<br />
We haven't seen a single too much memory crash since LAA was enabled by Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, it's not just 6 GB of RAM. Any x64 owner will have the large address aware flag enabled by default. It's either there or it's not, and with 4.1 released, it's there. Also, 64-bit operating systems can use 4 GB of address space. 32-bit are limited to 3 GB, and that's if the end-user tells the OS to acknowledge the flag at all, which is not recommended.</div></div><hr />

Why's that? Everyone can stand generally behind boss now (no stupid parries). Its up to the dps to not cause deaths this time (kill the adds or everyone dies) instead of healers stuck on dispel duty, and the concept of spreading out/stacking doesnt seem too hard to me.</div></div><hr />

If you read it all it's doing is checking if the player has the 64 bit client and loading a 64 bit version of scan.dll (ie Warden)<br />
<br />
This does not mean they even have a 64 bit client ready. It also doesn't mean it's coming in the immediate future necessarily.<br />
<br />
After all they do have a linux client they use internally which has never been released (and never going to be release afaik)</div></div><hr />

It makes sense that a 64-bit DLL would be used for collecting this hardware and software information on a 64-bit Windows platform.<br />

I'm almost certain this has nothing to do with an actual 64-bit Windows client.<br />

I'm not sure what you mean but right under my char I have a cooldown bar (not a priority thingy) and to the left of my char are my dottimers, both from fortexorcist!</div></div><hr />

It makes sense that a 64-bit DLL would be used for collecting this hardware and software information on a 64-bit Windows platform.<br />
<br />
You might be half right there.<br />
<br />
scan.dll is warden.<br />
<br />
Friend of mine on #wowuidev raised a good point :<br />
<br />
If there is a 64 bit client coming then why does it need to check if it is a 64 bit client ? <br />
<br />
That's like a car checking it's a car first before applying accelerant to the engines ? Does a web browser first check it's a web browser before fetching a page ? Makes no sense to me<br />
<br />
He thinks it could just be a 64 bit version of Warden. It's possible the calls &quot;isWindowsClient()&quot; and the &quot;Is64BitClient()&quot; is refereeing to having a 64 bit version of windows IE The operating system and not the wow client it self.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just extracted the FrameXML/GlueXML myself. The only place Is64BitClient() is used is in the lines of code already given. Straight after that it does a Warden scan with ScanDLLStart(SCANDLL_URL_LAUNCHER_TXT, dllURL);<br />
<br />
Not sure if that means the call is from internal Blizzard code or O/s code but it doesn't seem to be defined in the interface files you can extract at the login screen.</div></div><hr />

No, they don't. You can open an disassembler and check this out.<br />

First of all, scan.dll isn't warden. Also, you can't load 64-bit DLL into 32-bit process (this mean there's should be separate executable to do that). &quot;IsWindowsClient()&quot; and the &quot;Is64BitClient()&quot; has nothing to do with user's OS, they are identify WoW client as being Windows and 64-bit.<br />
<br />
And last, there's one more string, that was missed:<br />
<br />
<br />
GlueStrings.lua<br />
X64_BUILD = &quot;x64&quot;;<br />
<br />
(probably showed on login screen at bottom left corner)</div></div><hr />

Fair point about scan.dll. It could be warden it could be the survey scan they do for hardware. Blizzard won't confirm the inner workings of Warden even to an MVP so it could go either way.<br />
<br />
But until we see a Blizzard employee confirm if a 64 bit client is coming or not we can't confirm that the Is64BitClient() function call is referencing a 64 bit client. I think it comes down to if they are still going to support a 32 bit client and have a 64 bit client or go all to a 64 bit client. Again I point out that if the client is already a 64 bit client (when it's released) then why does it have to check if it is ?<br />
<br />
Is it possible to have a 64 bit program on a 64 bit operating system actually be running as 32 bit ? Is that why it still needs to check ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And last, there's one more string, that was missed:<br />
<br />
GlueStrings.lua<br />
X64_BUILD = &quot;x64&quot;;<br />
(probably showed on login screen at bottom left corner)<br />
<br />
That's an interesting find in GlueStrings.lua and is new to this build of the wow client. But there's also strings in there for Assertion builds , PTR only builds , internal builds , alpha builds, beta builds , debug builds , GM builds , release builds , PTR release builds , PTR assertions enabled builds, streaming builds ....<br />
<br />
Not all of which see the light of day as released to players. It's just a file of strings for common variables / strings for localisation purposes AFAIK. As proof it's still rather flimsy. It's entirely possible they could be working on a 64 bit client but are far far away from releasing it.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong here guys. I would love to see a 64 client for all architectures Blizzard supports as much as the next guy. I just think the player base likes to jump a bit too far ahead in their assumptions based on very little actual evidence. Or based on a misunderstanding of the evidence.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pixel</div><div class="date">2011-06-05, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A 32 bits process can not run a 64 bits DLL, and vice versa, otherwise they wouldn't be able to share their address space - or at least, wouldn't be able to do so easily. It's just way more simple to have a 64 bits DLL for a 64 bits process, and a 32 bits DLL for a 32 bits process.<br />
<br />
Hence the reason the WoW client needs to know which version is itself in order to properly set up which version of the DLL to load. The only funky part is &quot;why doing this in Lua ?&quot;.</div></div><hr />
