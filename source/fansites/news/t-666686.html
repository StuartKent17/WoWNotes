The new World of Warcraft Faction Change service is now live. As we mentioned previously, [ http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=18031079410&amp;sid=1 ] we’ve been in the process of developing a new service for World of Warcraft that will allow players to change their faction from Alliance to Horde or Horde to Alliance for a fee. After purchasing a Faction Change for a character, a player can choose any race of the opposite faction that is compatible with the character’s class. For more information on the Faction Change service, please read the FAQ, [ http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;tag=FCFAQ ] or visit the Faction Change page [ https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/faction-change-intro.html ] to get started.<br />
<br />
Based on further community feedback, we have also decided to offer a race change service in the future. Players who choose to switch races will be able to change their race within their same faction and class. Additional details will be released at a future date. <br />
<br />
Faction Change FAQ<br />
What is the Faction Change service?<br />
Our Faction Change service is designed to allow existing characters the opportunity to change their designated faction (from Horde to Alliance or Alliance to Horde).<br />
<br />
How do I begin the Faction Change process?<br />
To begin the Faction Change process, please visit the Account Management page, select the Faction Change option, and carefully follow the instructions provided.<br />
<br />
How much does this service cost?<br />
Each Faction Change costs $30.00 USD (not including applicable taxes). This covers a single Faction Change for a single character.<br />
<br />
Is this service taxed? If so, how can I tell if my purchase will be taxed?<br />
Players in select states in the U.S. may be subject to taxation when using our Faction Change service. This list includes, but is not limited to:<br />
- New Mexico<br />
- Texas<br />
<br />
Can I change multiple characters' factions at once?<br />
No. The Faction Change service only allows one change per transaction. If you would like to change multiple characters' factions, you will need to pay for each one separately.<br />
<br />
At what level can I change a character's faction?<br />
Characters level 10 and above are eligible for a Faction Change.<br />
<br />
Will PvP realm restrictions prevent me from changing a character's faction?<br />
No. PvP realms no longer possess any faction-based restrictions. You may now play Horde and Alliance characters on any realm you wish.<br />
<br />
Will this service allow me to customize a character and select a different name once its faction has been changed?<br />
Yes. Each Faction Change purchase will also provide the target character with an included re-customization and optional name change.<br />
<br />
When I change factions, can I select any race for the character?<br />
You may select any race of the new faction provided that it is available for the character's class.<br />
<br />
Does that mean I can use this service to change the character back to its original faction?<br />
Absolutely; however, this will require purchasing another Faction Change.<br />
<br />
When I change a character back to its original faction, can I select any new race?<br />
Yes. As noted previously, though, you will only be able to select a race that is available to the character's class.<br />
<br />
Will I be able to select Cataclysm races and class combinations for a character once they're available in game?<br />
Details are not available at this time. As development continues, though, we hope to provide more information.<br />
<br />
How often can I change a character's faction?<br />
You may change a character's faction every 60 days.<br />
<br />
What happens after I initiate a Faction Change?<br />
Once your payment has processed and after you have remained logged out of the game for at least 30 minutes, you will see a new button to the left of the character's name upon next login. Clicking on this button will allow you to select the character's new faction and race, as well as customize the character's look and name. These steps will greatly resemble the character creation process.<br />
<br />
To complete the Faction Change, press the button labeled &quot;Click to change your character's faction&quot; and confirm your selections. If you do not wish to change the character's faction immediately, you may do so at a later time.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's old name?<br />
If you opt to change the character's name, the name will be locked from use on the realm for 90 days. You are not required to change the character's name, though; this is simply an option we provide included with the Faction Change.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's equipment when I change its faction?<br />
Equipment which is not considered faction-specific will remain unchanged by this process. Faction-specific equipment, however, will be automatically exchanged for a cross-faction equivalent. You can view a full list of faction-specific equipment and their cross-faction equivalents here (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/faction-change/index.xml).<br />
<br />
**Please note that neither enchants nor socketed gems will be affected by an exchange.**<br />
<br />
Will the rest of the inventory (materials, alternate currency, etc) be affected in any way?<br />
As with equipment, items which are not considered faction-specific will remain unchanged by this process. Faction-specific items will be exchanged for a cross-faction equivalent. You can view a full list of faction-specific items here (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/faction-change/index.xml).<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's mounts when I change its faction?<br />
Mounts which are not considered faction-specific will remain unchanged by this process. Faction-specific mounts will be exchanged for a cross-faction equivalent. You can view a full list of faction-specific mounts and their equivalents here (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/faction-change/index.xml).<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's non-combat pets when I change its faction?<br />
Non-combat pets will not be affected by this process and will be available once the character's faction change completes. This even includes faction-specific non-combat pets.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's achievements when I change its faction?<br />
Achievements which are not considered faction-specific will remain unchanged by this process. Faction-specific achievements will be exchanged for a cross-faction equivalent. You can view a full list of faction-specific achievements and their equivalents here.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's titles when I change its faction?<br />
Titles which are not considered faction-specific will remain unchanged by this process. Faction-specific titles will be exchanged for a cross-faction equivalent. You can view a full list of faction-specific titles and their equivalents here.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's reputation levels when I change its faction?<br />
Upon changing factions, the reputation level associated with the character's previous race will become the reputation level of the new race. All other racial reputations will be converted according to the following chart:<br />
<br />
Orc (Orgrimmar) &#8596; Human (Stormwind)<br />
Tauren (Thunder Bluff) &#8596; Gnome (Gnomeregan Exiles)<br />
Undead (The Undercity) &#8596; Night Elf (Darnassus)<br />
Troll (Sen'jin) &#8596; Dwarf (Ironforge)<br />
Blood Elf (Silvermoon) &#8596; Draenei (The Exodar)<br />
<br />
Additional faction-specific reputations will be converted into their cross-faction equivalents (if a cross-faction equivalent exists). You can view a full list of qualifying faction-specific reputations and their equivalents here.<br />
<br />
Faction neutral reputations will not be affected by this process, and faction-specific reputations which do not possess an equivalent will be lost.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's quests when I change its faction?<br />
Quests which are active in the character's log at the time of the Faction Change will be cleared and all quest items associated with these quests will be destroyed.<br />
<br />
With this, completed quests that are considered faction-specific will be removed from the list of completed quests and no longer count towards any running &quot;quests completed&quot; totals. Should you ever elect to change back to the original faction, the original list of completed quests will be restored. Completed quests that are considered faction-neutral or possess a cross-faction equivalent will be unaffected or automatically exchanged without any detriment to the quest completed totals.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's flight paths when I change its faction?<br />
All flight points associated with the character will be reset and you will receive a new list of flight points which are appropriate for the level and new faction.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Ignore&quot; lists when I change its faction?<br />
The character's &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Ignore&quot; lists will be reset following a Faction Change.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's Guild and Arena team(s)?<br />
The character will not be affiliated with any Guild or Arena team following a Faction Change. Guild and Arena team tabards will be removed and Arena team ratings will be reset as a result. If the character is a Guild Master, you will not be able to perform a Faction Change.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's honor and Arena points?<br />
Any honor points, Marks of Honor, and lifetime honorable kills will not be affected by this process. Earned Arena points will carry over, as well; however, any pending Arena points accrued after the last maintenance period, but before your Faction Change is initiated, may be lost. <br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's mail and auctions?<br />
Active mail and auction items will prevent a character from Faction Changing, so please be sure to pull all mail from the mailbox and take down any auction items prior to initiating the Faction Change process. These items will be handled as normal inventory.<br />
<br />
Is there a gold limit for Faction Changes?<br />
Yes. Characters possessing too much gold for their designated level bracket will not be eligible for a Faction Change. Please use the following table as reference.<br />
<br />
Level 10 to 30: 300 gold<br />
Level 31 to 50: 1000 gold<br />
Level 51 to 69: 5000 gold<br />
Level 70 to 80: 20000 gold<br />
<br />
Where will the character be located after the Faction Change is complete?<br />
Once the Faction Change is complete, the character will be moved to the capital city of its new race.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's Armory profile?<br />
Once you have completed the Faction Change process, the character's Armory profile will be updated to reflect any faction, racial, gender, or name changes. Please note that our Armory system is still in beta at this time, so the character's profile may not immediately display the updated information.<br />
<br />
Will this service share a cooldown with the Character Transfer, Character Name Change, or Character Re-Customization services?<br />
No. The Faction Change service will not share its cooldown with any of these services.<br />
<br />
Can I use this service to change race on my existing faction?<br />
No. We will be releasing a Race Change service in the near future for this purpose.<br />
<br />
Will this service share a cooldown with the Race Change service?<br />
Yes. <br />
<br />
Can I purchase a Faction Change for a character that has a pending Name Change or Re-Customization or is in the process of being transferred?<br />
No. Before you may initiate a Faction Change for a character, please complete any pending Name Changes, Re-Customizations, or Transfers. These pending transactions will prevent you from initiating a Faction Change. <br />
<br />
When will I be charged for the character's Faction Change?<br />
You will be charged immediately upon pressing the confirmation button on the Faction Change page.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to cancel a Faction Change while the process is pending?<br />
Because your payment method will be charged immediately upon confirmation, you will be unable to cancel the process once you have pressed the confirmation button and the Faction Change process is underway.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to reverse a Faction Change once it's completed?<br />
No. Once a Faction Change is done, it is permanent. You may, however, purchase another Faction Change to switch back to the original faction once the service cooldown time has elapsed.</div></div><hr />

That's actually kind of snazzy. Could faction change in hopes of getting one of the awesome ivory raptors.<br />

If that's the case you could encourage your friends to transfer to horde and you server transfer there. Or maybe get your friends to chip in for the transfer if the money is that big of an issue.</div></div><hr />

True, but in the past you could keep the item without having to keep the quest, so the question still stands...</div></div><hr />

<br />
why changing alliance frostsaber to a discontinued mount instead of the ravasaur?<br />
That's a really good question; while using their faction change thingy, i did Night Elf to Troll to see the combo's, and the Frostsaber was equal to the long lost Ivory raptor of old.<br />
<br />
I actually think someone at Blizz had a brain fart, and they'll fix it to the Ravasaur pdq.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
you wont be able to it wipes all quests when you faction change <br />
Unlike other quest items, you don't need the quest to have that item. You can drop quest and keep the rod. Hence, it's not connected to the &quot;quest&quot; wipe they mentioned.</div></div><hr />

we all knew blizzard did this to get even more money out of us but 30 dollar for 5 seconds work is retarded<br />

<br />
It's more of a deterrent than a cashgrab.<br />
<br />
If you put a non trivial price on it, fewer people will transfer toons for trivial reasons. I'm sure you love your level 23 Nelf warrior, but for $30 it'd be more prudent to just reroll than tie up Blizzard resources.</div></div><hr />

Was one of the ones looking forward to the faction change, then ofcourse you can put it in my face that I dont have money. Just know I wont pay that amount and then on top of that, a server change.<br />
<br />
I would say if you look at it this way: The little guy who is playing on a dead alliance side, want to faction change it to horde. I would say 30$ would be kinda overkill.</div></div><hr />

levelling a new toon and regearing etc is much more than $30 worth of work. So what 8-9 days played to 80. Thats 200 hours, give or take. Even if you ignore gearing up time, thats $0.15 per hour you are saving if you really hate your toon's faction. Sounds like a hell of a deal to me. If you make minimum wage, thats 5 extra hours you have to work for a new toon on a new faction. Im certainly going to swap my human rogue to something I can stand to look at.</div></div><hr />

Apparently if you log out on a faction-specific mount, he was still on the mount even after he faction changed.<br />

He was on the Black War Tiger when he logged off, and he logged on in Undercity on top of it as an Undead. Sadly, when he dismounted it went to a Black War Kodo :(</div></div><hr />

Its not that much different in the case of a faction-change.<br />
<br />
I just thought of a metaphore:<br />
<br />
Imagine that a factionchange is like turning into Patrick Swayze in the movie 'Ghost'; you can still see all your friends, you can even make them aware of your presence - ..but they wont understand what you're trying to say. Well - unless you happen to play on the same realm as Whoopi Goldberg ofcourse! <br />
<br />
wonder how many folks will get it ;)<br />
<br />
Also, loads of folks transfered to another realm, so they could play with friends... Now imagine the amount of people that also wanted this, but couldnt due to their friends playing on another faction? I doubt that blizzard intentionally didnt merge the service just to gain quick bucks really, the number of people that make use of the service will indeed be over 9000, but thats still a thin slice of an 11 million-player cake</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a business, they've decided to set the price at $30.00 because hey it's easy money and people will still pay that amount and then faction change on top of it. Total win for blizzard in my opinion.<br />

Me for one I have a horde alt on a diff realm that is level 70, but I play on another realm cause I play alliance, and just cbf to level a priest again. So I will be making use of this function and Blizz will be leeching a neat $55 from me to transfer both factions and realms.<br />
<br />
Is it worth it? I say yes, I enjoyed playing my priest but didnt want to cause Ive made heaps of friends in my guild.<br />
<br />
The other 10% that will faction change will do it because:<br />
<br />
1: They have no friends.<br />
2: They CBF making friends.<br />
3: They sick of losing to the oposing faction.<br />
4: Those that have mates on oposing factions (this prob has smallest %)<br />
5: They have bad rep for being a ninja or a prick.<br />
<br />
I can gaurentee that this new service is aimed at the people that have chars accross many realms, and not at the one dude that wants to change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm guessing €25 ($35.60) since blizzard likes round numbers, but it really shouldnt be anything above that, imo<br />
<br />
The price itself isnt even something that 'really' bugs me to be honest. It will probably prevent 75% of the ppl who end up regretting it, to not transfer in the first place. I can also imagine many hordies being reliefed that their bloodelf population wont be quadrupling :p<br />
<br />
Oh and as McCrank made me realize, It would be a friendly compromise to give like a 50% discount on your 3rd/4th/5th character. Could even end up more profitable - or it would simply be a nice gesture like &quot;hey, thanks for spending an additional $220 on our game for a feature, you are a highly valued customer.

<br />
This is just pure infinite wisdom by Blizzard marketing execs. It can be broken down quite simply by them, yet yield a tremendous amount of money.<br />
<br />
1. They create a game without certain features.<br />
2. They withhold such features, for various given reasons (but no given reasons are the ACTUAL reasons).<br />
3. Years later when popularity has been established and financial gain can be made, implement said features for a large (relative to time involved) sum.<br />
4. ??<br />
5. Profit.<br />
<br />
In before &quot;company wants to make profit&quot;. This is a tad ridiculous. I doubt anyone's hourly wage could ever exceed 30 dollars for clicking a few check boxes to start the transfer of one character's faction to another, same goes with server transfer, character remodel, etc.<br />
<br />
It's not like some guy rolls up his sleeves at Blizzard HQ, opens the game editor and manually edits some person's character for hours on end, missing time with his wife and kids to ensure a quality process. In fact, like we find in all other aspects of WoW, very little human attention is given to the process until something goes wrong, at which point you are re-routed to the least likely person who can help you who is usually on the graveyard shift and upset with his life already. This is partially because they have so many millions of customers, automated processes NEED to be setup. But with millions of customers the prices of those services should drop... not rise.<br />
<br />
No. Tuning my bike costs me 30 dollars, because it involves manual labor, usage of inventory to repair/replace/clean/add to the bike and convenience. <br />
<br />
No where in this process, or other &quot;services&quot; Blizzard offers, does any manual labor come into play, inventory usage take place (unless you call 1-2 minutes of internet usage on one of their many terminals &quot;inventory&quot;), reduction in inventory, or overtime be needed. Their software, like all other companies, is designed to handle complex processes with a click of a mouse. A wastewater treatment plant is an excellent example. A computer can control complex valves and flood gates and sensors, but they don't pay that person as if he's actually going out and doing it all himself. They pay him the same as any other person sitting at a desk drinking coffee and listening to bad music.<br />
<br />
Again.. simple marketing, and they are milking customers like crazy. They are losing no money by doing this. No outside consultation is required. No increased advertising. No new material is required. The only impacting factor on a realistic cost for this would be the labor clocked in by the workers who first coded the ability to change factions. However, they want to be compensated for something they did once, but are no longer doing. They already get paid to make new code, work on new projects, etc. So if that were the case.. once again, the fee is grossly over exaggerated. Making a profit off a sale of a commodity they produce is one thing. Making a profit off something that takes no effort? Unethical. But it works.. so I applaud them for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The example with the 80% alliance / 20% horde server came up so this would be a perfect one.<br />
<br />
Of course, people could transfer to another server afterwards leaving no change to the population but I guess it would help because people get new/exciting stuff for free pretty much in opposite to the free migrations which are not popular since you almost always transfer to dead servers.<br />
<br />
Just a thought..</div></div><hr />

You are truly wrong. If you have ever looked at ebay you would find a great example of the first rule for pretty much any business/seller/etc. is that people will buy anything. There's never been a person who's sold something that no one on the face of the earth didn't want to buy. People will pay for anything, especially if someone (Blizzard) makes it seem important, when all it is is cosmetic changes to a virtual character you already pay 15 dollars a month for.</div></div><hr />

People prioritize money differently. Often times women spend money on useless things, this is not surprising. 100 dollars to make an ugly cat druid with horns into a pretty panther is easily logical to many women. But illogical to the rest of the sane world.</div></div><hr />

The part that irks me is that you shouldn't have to pay 30 dollars to do that, you already pay 15 a month for what should be a complete set of services for the game. If we didn't pay that fee, I can understand 25 dollars to move a character from A to B, or 30 dollars to be able to play with &quot;the enemy&quot; (since, most people when they get the game don't realize all communication is cut off with them unlike every other MMO made before it). <br />
<br />
And this isn't even considering people who pay for multiple accounts or spend the time leveling multiple alts. <br />
<br />
It's just really sad to see a company profiting so highly off something that should be relatively free.<br />
<br />
<br />

Not rambling! Have you ever had a girlfriend? They'd pay to see druids purple instead of brown. Pay good money. Ridiculous. Thankfully Blizzard added that one for free.. not so lucky for other aspects of the game, however.</div></div><hr />

When you purchase the paid faction change service you're basically given the complete character re-customization service as well, according to a friend who just did it. He had a male tauren druid and faction changed it to a night elf female, customized it's appearance how he wanted and is now transferring it to the server we currently play on.</div></div><hr />

Hasn't been an &quot;rpg&quot; by any sense of the word in a long time :P. Min/maxing, elitism, hardcore, official, tournament, rankings/ratings, these are the terms most commonly affiliated with the game and have been since TBC came out, and have forever changed the nature of the game. <br />
<br />
But ah well.. people can keep paying ridiculous money for virtual cosmetic changes... Blizzard will only be seeing &quot;yes I will pay for stupid crap in the future&quot; and make their services more fee-filled later down the road. 100 dollars to add an 11th character slot on a server! 20 for an extra bank slot! 50 to switch between your factions races and gender all at the same time! It's only going to get worse people.</div></div><hr />

its only Faction change not race change, you can't go alliance then back to horde, you will end up with the same race you where pre first faction transfer no matter what.</div></div><hr />

What about the old PvP ranks?<br />
for example: If I would change my UD-Mage(Rank11) to Draenei, does this Draenei get that old title?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grobs</div><div class="date">2009-09-03, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What will happen to the character's Guild and Arena team(s)?<br />
The character will not be affiliated with any Guild or Arena team following a Faction Change. Guild and Arena team tabards will be removed and Arena team ratings will be reset as a result. If the character is a Guild Master, you will not be able to perform a Faction Change.<br />
<br />
so you can move from server to server with your guild but you cannot change faction with your guild...except you make an lvl1 alt and make him the guildmaster and lose all the items and gold on your guild bank!? :&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've managed to avoid all the kids for the last 4 years.<br />
<br />
1. Leave trade and general channels off. Kiddies seem to love sitting there and be annoying and seek attention their fat stupid parents don't offer them. LFG is a massive no-no. so is /s and /y<br />
2. Our guild allow nobody under 25. You are required to take a Skype video interview with either a guy or gal officer. If you don't want to, fuck off. At that age you usually have your emotions under control. We have had a few slip through (older brothers interview for them, etc ) but you catch them out on Vent the first raid night when they are required to do tactics explanation. Instant /gkick. Saying that, I must stress that not all kids are like that and many is rather pleasant and mature, but we don't risk it.<br />
3. ALWAYS turn off BG chat the moment you get into one. Too many clueless kids and idiots spamming BG chat.<br />
4. Never PuG. Always run with guildies and mature friends you know.<br />
5. Use a good spam prevention tool and allow nobody under lv80 to /w you. It helps with the 'PLLZ PLZZZZZZZ PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ bost me tr3w ZalFurrak!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' In fact. my /w have been turned off since 2006. Anyone I would ever want to talk to is in the raid channel, friends channel or the guild.<br />
6. Stick to Dalaran as best possible and only use Darnassus (alliance obviously) for AH business. Less chance of having to suffer the presence of cretins.<br />
<br />
This way my WoW experience have been enjoyable all along without having to deal with the usual insects and kiddy pond scum you get in the game. Our whole guild follows those guidelines and everyone is happy :)</div></div><hr />

What about the old PvP ranks?<br />

<br />
I have to agree, there should be a limit to how intolerant a person can be. Funny how people willingly make themselves look like Hitler.<br />
<br />
Anyways. I like the faction change thing, because now I can transfer my old Gnome Mage over to the Horde and finally play him again without having to be Alliance. I have nothing against Alliance, it's just that none of my friends play Alliance anymore. Although I wish there was a server-change included too, since now it's going to cost me a lot.<br />
<br />
And when we're at that, the price is a big problem for a lot of young people, like me. I'm 18, but still going to school, so I don't have any income and aren't allowed to have a credit card which I can buy stuff on the Internet. The only one in the house who does is my father who is the kind of guy who thinks that video games are a waste of time and money and that it's ridiculous to pay for a game you already own. So I wish they wouldn't have put such an insane price on it.<br />
<br />
So yeah, some of us have that dilemma. :(</div></div><hr />

oh come on, the horde is the proverbial underdog in WoW and everyone likes underdogs. Also the Horde have thier own band (Lv80ETC) and its pretty apparent there isnt alot of love for the Alliance because they seem to get booed at every con I've been to (including Blizzcon). Also look on Wowmovies.com - most are horde movies. Most of the top guilds are Horde based.<br />

If you have ever looked at ebay you would find a great example of the first rule for pretty much any business/seller/etc. is that people will buy anything. There's never been a person who's sold something that no one on the face of the earth didn't want to buy. People will pay for anything, especially if someone (Blizzard) makes it seem important, when all it is is cosmetic changes to a virtual character you already pay 15 dollars a month for. <br />
<br />
<br />
ur right that people buy a lot of bs.<br />
but often that's just personal preference.<br />
<br />
blizzard doesn't need to make it &quot;seem&quot; important.<br />
for some people that's just a service they've been waiting for a long time.<br />
either u can use it, or u don't, no need for making it a big deal.<br />
and some of u are acting like the monthly fee got raised over the years.<br />
and blizzard didn't offer one thing that costs money that offers players who use it an advantage over players that don't.<br />
<br />
that would be buyout.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No you don't. Blizzard removed that restriction.<br />
<br />
<br />
But the general idea is that if you are changing your race, it's uaully the case that you're going to be changing your server anyways. Most cases would be people wanting to reroll a different faction on a different server. Odd's aren't that your friend/reason for changing faction isn't on the same server.<br />

<br />
we all knew blizzard did this to get even more money out of us but 30 dollar for 5 seconds work is retarded<br />
<br />
<br />
If they made it cheap people would use it all the time, and that would overload the server. Stop being an idiot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Leave trade and general channels off. Kiddies seem to love sitting there and be annoying and seek attention their fat stupid parents don't offer them. LFG is a massive no-no. so is /s and /y<br />
2. Our guild allow nobody under 25. You are required to take a Skype video interview with either a guy or gal officer. If you don't want to, fuck off. At that age you usually have your emotions under control. We have had a few slip through (older brothers interview for them, etc ) but you catch them out on Vent the first raid night when they are required to do tactics explanation. Instant /gkick. Saying that, I must stress that not all kids are like that and many is rather pleasant and mature, but we don't risk it.<br />
3. ALWAYS turn off BG chat the moment you get into one. Too many clueless kids and idiots spamming BG chat.<br />
4. Never PuG. Always run with guildies and mature friends you know.<br />
5. Use a good spam prevention tool and allow nobody under lv80 to /w you. It helps with the 'PLLZ PLZZZZZZZ PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ bost me tr3w ZalFurrak!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' In fact. my /w have been turned off since 2006. Anyone I would ever want to talk to is in the raid channel, friends channel or the guild.<br />
6. Stick to Dalaran as best possible and only use Darnassus (alliance obviously) for AH business. Less chance of having to suffer the presence of cretins.<br />
<br />
This way my WoW experience have been enjoyable all along without having to deal with the usual insects and kiddy pond scum you get in the game. Our whole guild follows those guidelines and everyone is happy :)<br />
<br />
<br />
All I have to say...and I am sorry right now for what I may say...but you and your guild are quite stupid to pay 15$/month for this game, because you know, LAN is still free.<br />

Anything they created that requires human intervention in any way is a service, that is why they charge you. because you pay for the use of their service that they put time and money into, and you have to pay the person clicking the approve button. The price might not be justified, but its what it is. and I bet in a year or 2 both transfers and faction/race changes will be no more than 20$ each.</div></div><hr />

<br />
[i]If Blizzard would make a nice bit of profit - and lets hypothetically say:<br />
<br />
10% of all players seriously consider(ed) a faction change<br />
Lets say roughly a third of those (so 3% of total) will actually go through with it within a month from today. 75% of them will combine it with a realm transfer<br />
3% of 11 million is 330.000 players (maybe 3% of players is too high, but its compensated by not calculating some ppl will transfer more then 1 char)<br />
<br />
Ok, so those people will all pay ~$30 (give or take considering price difference outside US)<br />
330.000 x $30 = $9.900.000<br />
<br />
Now remember, we still have 75% of the people that pay for realm xfer;<br />
75% of 330.000 = 247500 people. <br />
<br />
The realm transfer service costs $25.00.<br />
247500 x $25 = $6.187.500<br />
<br />
Now we combine the two costs together..<br />
$9.900.000 + $6.187.500 = $16.087.500<br />
<br />
Now, lets very generously say, 60% of what the customers pay will cover all the costs, leaving 40% as profit;<br />
40% of $16.087.500 = $6.435.000<br />
<br />
Not too bad, almost Six and-a-Half Million Dollars. Now just imagine them using that profit to increase server loads, or just into improving the game in general? :)<br />
<br />
I mean, I highly doubt that blizzard puts all its WoW profit straight into things like &quot;ah we need to produce more Starcraft II DVD's&quot; or &quot;lets hire an additional Diablo III design team&quot;. Yeah making games is an investment - but if you do it like you should, these investments eventually pay themselves back (again, even moreso in blizz's case).<br />
<br />
So we'll assume the $6.5 Million will be reinvested into WoW for now - hey at least now you can say you're contributing towards improving the game we all play and love :)</div></div><hr />

We know that, but re-read this sentence.<br />

Is it me, or you somehow made up those numbers in some random way? ;D<br />

Fraction change and realm transfer cost 10 million to develop? Orly? :D<br />
It's a project doable by 1-5 guys max, during 3-6 month max. It cannot cost that much.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, having insane profit margins it's a bit too greedy to charge extra for each new feature. Remember, those customers make your hundreds of money sacks full of money.</div></div><hr />

30 US Dollar = 21.08489 Euro<br />
<br />
30 Euro (EUR) = 42.68460 US Dollar (USD) <br />
<br />
Soooo, is it gonna be 20 Euro or 30 Euro ( 43 USD ) ? I gues it will be 30 Euro.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because there's no single-player game with the vast amount of content that WoW has. And that's because there's no business model to support it.<br />
<br />
You find me a single-player game that'll let me pay for a never-ending stream of professionally-written content updates that's as well put-together as WoW and I'll jump ship in a second. I play WoW in spite of it being an MMO, not because it's an MMO.</div></div><hr />

i lold, so typically for blizzard.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amgyn</div><div class="date">2009-09-03, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok ofcourse I would prefer to pay &#128;20 for a faction+realmchange as opposed to &#128;45 - but[/u]... theres a somewhat more positive way to look at it;<br />
<br />
[i]If Blizzard would make a nice bit of profit - and lets hypothetically say:<br />
<br />
10% of all players seriously consider(ed) a faction change<br />
Lets say roughly a third of those (so 3% of total) will actually go through with it within a month from today. 75% of them will combine it with a realm transfer<br />
3% of 11 million is 330.000 players (maybe 3% of players is too high, but its compensated by not calculating some ppl will transfer more then 1 char)<br />
<br />
Ok, so those people will all pay ~$30 (give or take considering price difference outside US)<br />
330.000 x $30 = $9.900.000<br />
<br />
Now remember, we still have 75% of the people that pay for realm xfer;<br />
75% of 330.000 = 247500 people. <br />
<br />
The realm transfer service costs $25.00.<br />
247500 x $25 = $6.187.500<br />
<br />
Now we combine the two costs together..<br />
$9.900.000 + $6.187.500 = $16.087.500<br />
<br />
Now, lets very generously say, 60% of what the customers pay will cover all the costs, leaving 40% as profit;<br />
40% of $16.087.500 = $6.435.000<br />
<br />
Not too bad, almost Six and-a-Half Million Dollars. Now just imagine them using that profit to increase server loads, or just into improving the game in general? :)<br />
<br />
I mean, I highly doubt that blizzard puts all its WoW profit straight into things like &quot;ah we need to produce more Starcraft II DVD's&quot; or &quot;lets hire an additional Diablo III design team&quot;. Yeah making games is an investment - but if you do it like you should, these investments eventually pay themselves back (again, even moreso in blizz's case).<br />
<br />
So we'll assume the $6.5 Million will be reinvested into WoW for now - hey at least now you can say you're contributing towards improving the game we all play and love :)<br />

Jesus...stop crying all of you. You seriously don't think that your whining over here will make a difference for Blizzard. Some computer games are made for the sole purpose of making profit for game producers. So YES...if i don't have the money to pay for it,than DON'T! It's not like Blizzard is making you pay it...</div></div><hr />

Why not just mail that stuff to the alt you're moving? It is even instant to mail to your own alts. Hell, spread it out amongst the other guildies that are moving, you trust them, right?</div></div><hr />

So once you transfer you have to spend what, 2-3 weeks regaining your crusader title so you can do ToC again.<br />

I wish I could follow the logic of that when they transferred and converted just about everything else.<br />

Unlocking Crusader and being exalted with Sunreavers / Alli Equivalent unlock a new set of dailies, boosting the amount of champions seals you get per day.<br />

Once your payment has processed and after you have remained logged out of the game for at least 30 minutes, you will see a new button to the left of the character's name upon next login. Clicking on this button will allow you to select the character's new faction and race, as well as customize the character's look and name. These steps will greatly resemble the character creation process.<br />
<br />
To complete the Faction Change, press the button labeled &quot;Click to change your character's faction&quot; and confirm your selections. If you do not wish to change the character's faction immediately, you may do so at a later time.<br />
<br />
People have been complaining about long que times in doing a faction change. I wonder if it has anything to do with &quot;you have to remain logged out of the game for at least 30 min&quot;?</div></div><hr />

I've been logged out of the game since yesterday and i am yet to see a button or confirm an email telling me that my character is ready for his faction change.. Its still under transactions being &quot;processed&quot;. Anybody know why its taking this long? Btw, if I go under the list of chars i have on the server the char i want to have switch factions says ineligible and NA(In Account Management not ingame). Is that because he is being...&quot;processed&quot; or ?</div></div><hr />

Don't try to log into your acct until you get the email saying it has been swapped. I made the mistake of logging in a few times impatiently. It probably delayed the process.<br />
